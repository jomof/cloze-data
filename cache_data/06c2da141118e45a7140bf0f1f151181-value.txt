    "writeup": "とうとう is an adverb used to express that something **finally** happens, often after a long period or some effort. It carries the nuance of something reaching its conclusion or resolution.  The kanji for とうとう is **到頭**, which literally translates to \"reaching the head/beginning,\" implying the culmination of something.  Therefore, both \"finally\" and \"after all\" capture its essence.  Like many Japanese adverbs, it often appears at the beginning of a sentence or clause.\n\nWhile generally written in hiragana, understanding the kanji helps grasp the inherent sense of arrival or culmination.  This adverb is versatile, applicable to both positive and negative outcomes, focusing more on the time and process leading to the result rather than the result's nature.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   とうとう is used when there's a sense of waiting or effort involved. It's not suitable for events that occur naturally without any particular effort or delay.\n*   Distinguish it from **いよいよ**, which also means \"finally\" or \"at last,\" but is used more for things that are about to begin or happen, often with anticipation.",
