  "writeup": "その上 (sono ue) is a formal expression used in Japanese to indicate that something is 'besides,' 'in addition to,' or 'furthermore' in relation to a previous statement.  It typically appears at the beginning of a sentence, adding new information to what's already been said.  Think of the literal meaning as 'on top of that (B),' where 'that' refers to the previously mentioned information (A). While often used in formal settings, its simplicity makes it surprisingly common in everyday speech, especially when adding a consequential point. The nuance shifts subtly depending on context, but it always implies a continuation or addition to a previously established fact.",
  "etymology": "The etymology is straightforward.  'その' (sono) means 'that' or 'the aforementioned,' '上' (ue) means 'top' or 'above.'  Thus, the phrase literally means 'on top of that,' implying an addition or further point building upon what came before.",
  "examples": [
