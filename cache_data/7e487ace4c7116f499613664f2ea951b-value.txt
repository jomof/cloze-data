    "etymology": "The verb 「済む」originally carried a sense of purification or cleansing. Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass the idea of something being completed, settled, or resolved. The modern usage reflects this evolution, implying that a task or situation has reached a satisfactory conclusion or requires only minimal effort to resolve.",
    "writeup": "「済む」(sumu) is a versatile Japanese verb with meanings ranging from \"to be finished\" or \"to end\" to \"to be settled\" or \"to be enough.\" It expresses the idea of completion, resolution, or sufficiency. It can also imply getting by with minimal resources or avoiding negative consequences. The level of politeness depends on the conjugation used. 「済む」is a JLPT N2 level kanji. The kanji itself is simple, so beginners can use this grammar point with ease.\n\n**Key usages include:**\n\n*   Indicating that something is completed or finished. For example, 「仕事が済んだ」(shigoto ga sunda) means \"the work is finished.\"\n*   Expressing that something is settled or resolved, like 「問題は済んだ」(mondai wa sunda), meaning \"the problem is resolved.\"\n*   Conveying sufficiency or adequacy, such as 「少しの量で済む」(sukoshi no ryō de sumu), which means \"a small amount is enough.\"\n*   Implying getting by with minimal resources or effort, as in 「これで済む」(kore de sumu), meaning \"this will suffice\" or \"this will do.\"\n\nIt is important to note the nuance of each usage and the context in which 「済む」is used to fully grasp its meaning.",
