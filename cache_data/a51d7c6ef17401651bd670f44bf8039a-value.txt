  "writeup": "てでも is a combination of the conjunction-particle て and the prefix adverbial particle でも.  Regular interpretations include 'no matter what', or 'even if I have to (A)'. When connected to verbs, てでも just emphasizes that 'even if (A) needs to be done, it will be', and expresses the speaker's strong determination to do something, regardless of the consequences or difficulty. Due to てでも expressing strong will, it's often seen in sentences including phrases marking desire or intent, such as ほしい, たい, and ようと思う.  Fun fact: Although てでも is considered slang due to the use of てでも rather than the usual ても, the construction of a て-form partnered with an adverbial particle is quite common and often marks emphasis or comparison. This is regularly seen with ては in patterns like てはいけない or てはだめ.",
  "etymology": "The て form is a versatile grammatical form in Japanese, allowing for various conjugations and uses.  The particle でも adds an element of emphasis, implying a determined effort despite challenges. This combination creates a particularly forceful expression of intent.",
