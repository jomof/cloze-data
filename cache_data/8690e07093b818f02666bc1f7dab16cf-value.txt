    "etymology": "The grammar point combines the passive auxiliary verbs れる (reru) or られる (rareru) with the noun まま (mama), meaning 'state' or 'condition', and the case particle に (ni).  Literally, it conveys the idea of acting 'in the state of' having something done to oneself, implying compliance with an instruction or request.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「れる・られる + ままに」 indicates doing something **exactly as instructed or ordered**. The passive forms れる (reru) and られる (rareru) imply that the action being followed originates from someone else.  The addition of ままに (mama ni), meaning \"in the state of\", emphasizes the direct and unresisting nature of the compliance. This structure is generally used in **formal contexts** and often with verbs of communication like 言う (iu - to say), 命じる (meijiru - to order), 聞く (kiku - to ask), 教える (oshieru - to teach), and 要求する (youkyuu suru - to demand).\n\nThe particle が (ga) can occasionally appear between られる and ままに, such as in 「言われるがままに」. While adding a nuance of concession or unexpectedness, the primary focus remains on the act of complying without resistance.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The られる form in this pattern **will not be in the past tense**.",
