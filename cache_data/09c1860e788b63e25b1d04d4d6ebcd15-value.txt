  "writeup": "This lesson focuses on using な-adjectives as predicates.  A predicate describes the subject or topic of a sentence. In Japanese, this is called a 述語 (jutsugō), meaning 'statement word'.  な-adjectives, when used as predicates, can stand alone,  or they can appear at the end of a sentence. Importantly, all な-adjectives also function as nouns, giving them a noun-like quality as predicates.  When a な-adjective is the only word in the predicate, the sentence feels similar to English expressions like \"It's pretty\" or \"It's dangerous.\" The specific \"it\" needs to be inferred from context.  Unlike い-adjectives, な-adjectives change form depending on their sentence position. At the end of a sentence, they're always followed by だ or です (polite). Before the word they modify, they're followed by な. This is why they're called な-adjectives. Often, は or が can be used before a na-adjective predicate. The choice depends on context. Generally, が is used when highlighting the subject as distinct from others in its category. For instance,  using が emphasizes a particular station's unusual dirtiness, while は would feel unnatural.  Many な-adjectives are of foreign origin (Chinese or English).",
  "etymology": "The term \"な-adjective\" itself is a descriptive term coined by linguists to categorize adjectives that require the particle \"な\" before nouns but use \"だ\" or \"です\" as a copula. The usage reflects the grammatical structure of Japanese, where adjectives are classified not just by meaning but also by their behavior within sentences.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "この駅は汚い**だ**。",
      "english": "This station is dirty.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses \"この駅\" (kono eki), which is a relatively common way to refer to a specific station.  The use of \"だ\" instead of \"です\" indicates a casual register."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "このケーキは美味しい**です**。",
      "english": "This cake is delicious.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "polite non-past",
      "nuance": "The polite form \"です\" is used, appropriate for most formal situations. The phrase \"このケーキ\" (kono ke-ki) is a common way to refer to cake."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あのレストランは静か**だった**。",
      "english": "That restaurant was quiet.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": "plain past",
      "nuance": "The past tense \"だった\" (datta) is used, indicating a recollection of a past event. The phrase \"あのレストラン\" (ano resutoran) is commonly used to refer to a restaurant that is somewhat distant from the speaker and listener."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの映画はつまらな**かった**です。",
      "english": "That movie was boring.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "casual",
      "conjugation": "polite past negative",
      "nuance": "The past negative polite form \"ありませんでした\" (arimasendeshita) shows politeness in sharing a negative opinion on the movie. The use of \"あの映画\" (ano eiga) implies a movie that is somewhat removed in time and space from the current conversation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたが優しいのは嬉しい**です**。",
      "english": "It makes me happy that you're kind.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "polite non-past",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses \"嬉しい\" (ureshii), which is a common way to express happiness. The polite \"です\" shows respect in a romantic setting, while \"あなたが優しい\"(anata ga yasashii) is a gentle way to compliment the listener."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたの笑顔は素敵**だ**よ。",
      "english": "Your smile is wonderful.",
      "register": "casual",

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The use of \"よ\" (yo) adds a softening effect, making the compliment more approachable. \"あなたの笑顔\" (anata no egao) is a classic way of saying \"your smile\" in a positive context."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "今日の空は本当に綺麗**だ**ね。",
      "english": "The sky is so beautiful today.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "nuance": "The sentence is a simple observation, fitting for a casual conversation. The use of \"ね\" (ne) seeks agreement or confirmation from the listener."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the choice between は and が depends entirely on what you want to highlight in the sentence.  Context is key!  Also, notice how the politeness level is very easily changed with just the addition or removal of です.  This is a very common feature of な-adjectives.",
