  "writeup": "それでも (soredemo) is a versatile conjunction meaning \"but still,\" \"and yet,\" \"even so,\" or \"nevertheless.\"  It's formed by combining the pronoun それ (sore, \"that\") and the adverbial particle でも (demo, \"even,\" \"still,\" \"though\").  Unlike some similar expressions, それでも emphasizes that despite a preceding statement (A), a contrasting or unexpected subsequent action or situation (B) still occurs.  Think of it as \"even with that (A), (B) still happens.\"  Mastering its subtle nuance enhances your ability to express unexpected turns and persistence in Japanese conversation.",
  "etymology": "The etymology is straightforward.  It's a simple combination of the demonstrative pronoun それ (sore) meaning 'that' or 'it', and the particle でも (demo) which softens a preceding statement, often indicating a concession or exception. The combination expresses a continuation despite a prior circumstance.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to distinguishing these similar expressions lies in their subtle differences in connotation and register.  Consider the context, the speaker's attitude, and the level of formality required to choose the most appropriate conjunction.  For determined continuation despite a reason to stop, それでも (soredemo) is a safe and effective choice for most contexts."
