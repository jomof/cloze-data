    "writeup": "もっとも, sometimes also seen as 尤も, is a conjunction that is used to add a clarifying or qualifying remark to a previous statement.  It often translates to \"although\", \"but\", \"however\", or \"for all that\". Think of it as saying, \"That's true, **but** there's more to the story.\"  The part following もっとも usually presents a limitation, exception, or alternative perspective to the initial point. You'll often see the second clause end with が, けど, or けれども, reinforcing this contrast. As a standalone noun, 尤も (mottomo) means \"reasonable\" or \"right\", and this sense of adding a reasonable qualification is present in its use as a conjunction.",
