  "writeup": "This grammar point focuses on forming the past tense of い-adjectives.  These adjectives, describing states or qualities, require a specific conjugation to indicate past time.  We achieve this by transforming the adjective's stem and adding the past tense marker.  The stem is created by removing the final -い and replacing it with -かった for plain speech and -かったです for polite speech.  This simple addition significantly alters the meaning, shifting the description from present to past. \"The process is straightforward, yet mastering the nuances of its application is crucial for effective communication.\"",
  "etymology": "The past tense marker -かった is derived from the verb ある (to be/exist), and  -かったです is a polite form developed from this base.  Understanding the connection to ある clarifies the grammatical function.",
