    "etymology": "ので is etymologically derived from the te-form (て form) of のだ (no da). While のだ explains the reason or cause, ので uses that explanation as a reason to connect to another clause.",
    "writeup": "ので is a conjunctive particle that connects two clauses by indicating a reason or cause. It's similar in meaning to から (kara), and is often translated as \"because,\" \"since,\" or \"so.\" However, ので tends to be more objective and emphasizes the logical connection between events.  It is frequently used to explain the reason for a situation or action in a more formal or polite way compared to から. ので can be used with the ます form.",
