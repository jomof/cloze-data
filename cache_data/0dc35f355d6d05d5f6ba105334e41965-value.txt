    "etymology": "The grammar point というところ combines the quotative particle と, the verb 言う (iu, \"to say\"), and the noun ところ (tokoro, \"place\", \"point\", or \"situation\").  The literal sense is akin to \"the point where saying [something] is appropriate\" or \"the situation where one would say [something]\".  This evolved to indicate an approximation or estimation.",
    "writeup": "The grammar expression **というところ** (to iu tokoro) is employed to indicate an approximate number, degree, or assessment.  It conveys the sense of \"I would say about (A)\" or \"I guess about (A)\".  A more literal interpretation might be \"To be at the point where saying (A) is accurate\".  It suggests a reasonable estimation or the best possible evaluation in a given context. This structure frequently appears after nouns or verbs, and less commonly after adjectives.  **というところ** typically concludes a sentence and is often followed by the auxiliary verb だ or です.  The past tense form, **といったところ**, can be used without altering the meaning.  It's **important** to note that **というところ** leans towards expressing a practical maximum or a likely upper limit rather than a minimum. Consequently, using it to suggest an approximate minimum might sound unnatural.",
