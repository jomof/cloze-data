    "etymology": "「だった」 is the past tense plain form of the copula 「だ」. 「だ」 itself is believed to have originated from 「と」 and the auxiliary verb 「あり」 (to be). Over time, 「とあり」 contracted to 「たり」 and eventually became 「だ」. Adding 「た」 to 「だ」 creates the past tense. Similarly, 「でした」 is the past tense polite form of the copula 「です」. 「です」 is a polite form of 「だ」, and its past tense is formed by changing 「す」 to 「した」.",
    "writeup": "To express that something 'was' a certain way in the past, you use だった (casual) or でした (polite). These attach to the end of a noun or な-Adjective.  Think of it as the past tense of the copula, 'to be'.\n\n**Important Points:**\n*   だった is the casual past tense form.\n*   でした is the polite past tense form.\n*   They are used with nouns and な-Adjectives.\n*   **Crucially**, you cannot use だった or でした with い-Adjectives. い-Adjectives have their own past tense conjugations (e.g., 楽しい → 楽しかった).",
