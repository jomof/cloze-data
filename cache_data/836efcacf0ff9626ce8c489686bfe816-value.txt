    "etymology": "The expression 「に気がつく」 combines the particle 「に」, the noun 「気」 (ki, meaning spirit, mind, or attention), and the verb 「付く」 (tsuku, meaning to attach or adhere). The phrase literally translates to \"attention attaches to,\" indicating a shift in awareness or realization.",
    "writeup": "「に気がつく」 is a common expression used to highlight when someone **notices that (A)**, or **realizes that (A)**. 「付く」 (tsuku) means \"to be attached.\" The particle 「に」 marks the 'location' to where your 「気」 (ki), which can be thought of as 'attention', becomes attached. This structure can be used after nouns or verbs nominalized with 「の」 or 「こと」.\n\n「気」 has various English translations, including \"spirit,\" \"attention,\" \"will,\" and \"consciousness.\" However, \"presence of mind\" is perhaps the most accurate. The location to which your focus, attention, or perception is drawn always highlights your 「気」.",
