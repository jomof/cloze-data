  "writeup": "「おまけに」 (omakeni) is a colloquial phrase meaning \"in addition,\" \"on top of that,\" \"what's more,\" or even \"to make matters worse.\"  It's used to add information, often presenting a second piece of news that relates to the first.  The crucial point is that both pieces of information share a similar positive or negative valence—they are both good, or both bad. You wouldn't typically use 「おまけに」to combine good and bad news in the same sentence.  The structure comes from the noun 「おまけ」 (omake), meaning \"bonus\" or \"freebie.\"  This indicates that the second piece of information (B) is an extra addition to the first (A). While \"omake\" itself usually implies something positive, 「おまけに」can express a variety of sentiments depending on the context of the sentence. Importantly, it is primarily used in spoken Japanese and casual written settings. This phrase functions as a conjunction, connecting two clauses or sentences. The placement of 「おまけに」is typically at the beginning of a new sentence or a new clause.  Consider the subtle difference between 「おまけに」and similar phrases like 「それに」 (soreni): 「おまけに」 maintains the original sense of (B) being an addition or a bonus, implying (A) was already sufficient in some way, and (B) simply amplifies the situation, either positively or negatively.",

  "etymology": "The phrase's etymology directly relates to the word おまけ (omake), meaning a gift or bonus.  The addition of に (ni) functions as a particle indicating circumstance or accompaniment, thus expanding the meaning from a simple bonus to an additional element in a larger situation. The evolution of the word demonstrates the dynamic nature of Japanese, where a single noun can expand to encompass broader contextual meanings.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to distinguishing these phrases lies in understanding their subtle differences in connotation.  「おまけに」 emphasizes the additional nature of the information, almost like a surprise bonus.  The other phrases simply add information without this extra nuance. Choosing the right phrase depends on whether you want to highlight the added element as a bonus or simply as additional information."
