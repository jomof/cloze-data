  "writeup": "The particle とも, when combined with the classical auxiliary verb ず (used for negation), creates ずとも.  This phrase implies that regardless of a hypothetical situation (A), another situation (B) still applies.  It often translates to 'even if not (A), (B)' or 'don't have to (A) to achieve (B)'.  ずとも attaches to the ない-stem of verbs. For nouns, ならずとも (the negative of なる 'to become') is used to express 'not being (A)'. While formally used, ずとも can be used sarcastically, and is frequently followed by 良い, meaning 'it's okay even if not (A)'.",
  "etymology": "ずとも combines ず, the negative form of the verb する (to do), and とも, a particle indicating 'even if'.  The use of ず is archaic, reflecting the formal and somewhat literary nature of this grammatical construction.  The combination emphasizes a concession—the non-occurrence of one state doesn't prevent the occurrence of another.",
