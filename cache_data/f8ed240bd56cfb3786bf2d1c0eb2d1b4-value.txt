  "writeup": "The Japanese phrase よりほかない (yoru hoka nai) translates to \"have no choice but,\" \"no other way than,\" or \"have to.\"  It's used similarly to しかない (shikanai), but carries a more formal and slightly stronger sense of inevitability.  This structure emphasizes that only one option exists. Let's dissect its components: より (yori) means \"than\" or \"from,\" 他 (hoka) means \"other,\" and ない (nai) is the negative form of the verb ある (aru, to exist).  Therefore, a literal interpretation is \"there is nothing other than (A).\"  However, the core meaning leans towards the impossibility of alternatives rather than simply the absence of other options.  The nuance often conveys a sense of resignation or constraint.  The particles に (ni), は (wa), or both (には - ni wa) can sometimes be inserted between 他 (hoka) and ない (nai), adding further emphasis to the lack of choice.",
