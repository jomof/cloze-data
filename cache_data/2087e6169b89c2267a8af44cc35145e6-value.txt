    "etymology": "The suffix み originates from the nominalizing suffix in classical Japanese. It attaches to the stem of adjectives to create nouns that denote a quality or state.  It shares roots with the verb 見(み)る \"to see,\" suggesting an inherent quality that can be observed or felt.",
    "writeup": "The suffix み is used to convert **い-adjectives** and **な-adjectives** into nouns, typically indicating a quality, condition, or state. Think of it like adding \"-ness\" to an adjective in English. To form this noun, attach み to the **stem** of the adjective. For い-adjectives, this means removing the い. For な-adjectives, remove the な.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   み focuses on the **inherent quality** of something, not necessarily the degree or intensity.  For example, you would use it to talk about the general \"warmth\" of a home, not to measure how warm it is in degrees.\n*   Sometimes, み is used as a direct substitute for the noun 味 (あじ), meaning \"taste\" or \"flavor.\" In these cases, it often describes a sensory quality like taste or color.\n*   This suffix is commonly used and understood across different demographics.",
