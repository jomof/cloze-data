    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ている」 combines the te-form 「て」 of a verb with the auxiliary verb 「いる」 (to exist/be). This combination expresses the continuous or resultant state of the action described by the verb.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「ている」, builds on the basic concept of 「ている」 that you may already know. Here, 「ている」 indicates that something exists in a state *resulting* from a completed action. The focus is on the current state, not the action itself. Think of it as 'existing in a state of (A) having been done'. For example, if something has 'started,' it exists in the state of being ongoing. If something 'dies,' it exists in the state of being dead.",
