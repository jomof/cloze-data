    "etymology": "「ものなら」is derived from 「もの」 (thing, idea) and 「なら」 (the conditional form of 「だ」). It expresses the idea of \"if something were a thing,\" implying a hypothetical and often unrealistic condition.",
    "writeup": "「ものなら」 expresses a hypothetical situation that is unlikely or impossible, often with a nuance of wanting something to be true or possible. It's often used with verbs in the potential form to emphasize the condition is difficult to achieve. The second half of the sentence usually expresses a wish, desire, or intention related to the hypothetical situation. You'll often see it paired with 「〜てみる」 (to try) or 「〜てみたい」 (want to try) to emphasize the speaker's desire or challenge.",
