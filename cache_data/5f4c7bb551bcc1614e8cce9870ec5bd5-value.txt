  "writeup": "おかげで (or お陰で in kanji) expresses gratitude or acknowledges a cause-and-effect relationship.  It's commonly translated as \"thanks to\" or \"because of.\"  The structure combines the honorific prefix お-, the noun 陰 \"shade,\" and the particle で.  Literally, it suggests being \"in the shade of (A),\" implying (B) only occurred due to the favorable conditions created by (A).  It can follow any word in its attributive form.  Importantly, おかげで can be used sarcastically, similar to the English equivalent, often conveying a negative sentiment despite the seemingly positive phrasing.  The context and tone clearly indicate the sarcastic intent.  Interestingly, it often begins sentences, functioning like \"thankfully\" or \"luckily\" in English, highlighting a fortunate outcome amidst potential adversity.  This nuance adds depth and flexibility to its usage.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of おかげで lies in the word 陰 (かげ, kage), meaning \"shade.\"  The original image is one of being sheltered or protected from harm, hence the association with gratitude and fortunate circumstances. The honorific prefix お- adds politeness, making it suitable for many situations.",
