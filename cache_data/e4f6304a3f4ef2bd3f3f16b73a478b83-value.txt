  "etymology": "The grammar point 「ている」 is a combination of 「て」-form of a verb, indicating a manner or state, and the verb 「いる」, meaning 'to exist' or 'to be'. Therefore, literally, 「ている」 means 'to exist in the state of doing something'. This etymology reflects its function of describing ongoing actions or existing states resulting from actions.",
  "writeup": "The 「ている」 form in Japanese is used to express actions in progress or states that are the result of a previous action. It's equivalent to the \"~ing\" form in English (e.g., \"eating,\" \"studying\").\n\n*   **Ongoing Actions:** Indicates that an action is currently happening. For example, 「食べている」 means \"is eating.\"\n*   **Resultant States:** Describes a state that exists as a result of a previous action. For example, 「知っている」 means \"knows\" (literally, \"is in the state of knowing\").\n\nThis form is created by attaching 「いる」 to the *te-* form of a verb. 「いる」 is often contracted to 「る」 in casual speech, resulting in forms like 「てる」. Be aware that verbs like 「死ぬ」 and 「知る」 appear in the 「ている」 form to describe a state, which might be translated into the past tense in English.",

  "changes": [
    "violation: Corrected details.品詞 from '接続助詞' to '助動詞' because 'ている' functions as an auxiliary verb construction, not a conjunctive particle. (Rule: Fix minor inaccuracies in 'details'.)",

    "violation: Replaced Example 9 due to grammatical incorrectness ('忙ししています') and to ensure diversity in speaker/listener age. The new example, '来月のプロジェクトについて、準備を{進めています}。', correctly uses 'ている' and features older speakers/listeners in a professional setting. (Rule: The 'japanese' must be grammatically correct. Rule: Example sentences should include at least one younger and one older speaker_age/listener_age.)",
    "violation: Refined the 'nuance' for Example 8 to provide a more accurate explanation of the particle 'の' when used with gendered speech. (Rule: Nuance must explain how this sentence exhibits the interplay between speaker/listener age/gender, why the register applies.)",
    "violation: Added speaker_age and listener_age to Example 1 to ensure a full demographic range is represented across examples. (Rule: Example sentences should include at least one younger and one older speaker_age.)"
