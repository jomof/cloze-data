  "writeup": "上は (ue wa) is a rather formal and somewhat archaic expression that indicates a consequence or condition based on a preceding action or state.  It translates most accurately as 'once (A), (B)', 'since (A), (B)', 'now that (A), (B)', or 'as long as (A), (B)'.  The nuance suggests that (B) is a natural or logical outcome of (A).  The word 上 (ue) means 'above' or 'on top of', but in this grammatical construction, it acts more like a conjunction, expressing a conditional relationship.  The particle は (wa) marks the topic, highlighting (A) as the established premise.  The structure generally follows verbs in their dictionary form. Its rather stiff, formal nature makes it less common in modern speech compared to alternatives like からには (kara ni wa) or 以上は (ijou wa).",
