  "writeup": "The phrase だけあって expresses the natural consequence of a preceding cause, conveying a sense of 'as might be expected' or 'it's only natural because...'.  It emphasizes that a result is a direct and logical outcome of a pre-existing quality or condition. The structure combines だけ ('just', 'only') and the past-tense form of ある ('to exist').  Therefore, it implies that an inherent characteristic of the subject leads to the anticipated outcome.  Crucially, this outcome must be positive or desirable in relation to the subject.  While it can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (with な), and nouns, it's important to avoid using it with future possibilities or uncertainty (i.e., avoid using it with words like だろう, でしょう, かもしれない).  It highlights an established characteristic, not a potential one.",
  "etymology": "The phrase is a combination of だけ (dake) meaning 'only' or 'just' and あって (atte) which is the past te-form of ある (aru) meaning 'to exist' or 'to be'.  The past tense form subtly suggests a pre-existing condition.",
