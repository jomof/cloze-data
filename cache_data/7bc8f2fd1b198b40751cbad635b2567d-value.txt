  "writeup": "The expression \"たものだ\" builds upon the concept of \"ものだ,\" which expresses a strong conviction about something's nature or reality.  Adding the past-tense marker \"た\" shifts this to the past, creating a nuance similar to 'I used to...,' but more accurately conveying '...was the way it used to be.'  Crucially, \"たものだ\" implies a sense of reminiscence, nostalgia, or introspection. It's not suitable for describing inconsequential past events.  The implication is that the action carries some weight or significance in the speaker's memory. For mundane past actions, use \"たことがある\" instead.",
  "etymology": "The phrase combines the past tense marker \"た\" (from the verb する, to do), the noun \"もの\" (thing), and the copula \"だ\" (to be).  The combination creates a nuanced expression reflecting the speaker's perspective on a past event or state of being.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Observe how the \"たものだ\" construction subtly conveys a sense of the past being significant, often with a tinge of longing or reflection. The choice of verbs and accompanying phrases significantly contribute to the overall mood and context of the sentence.  The subtle differences in phrasing and word choices may seem small, but they convey profound shifts in register and emotional nuance.",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that \"たことがある\" is a more neutral way to describe past actions, while \"たものだ\" implies a deeper emotional connection to the past event.  Consider the significance and emotional weight you wish to convey before choosing between these two expressions."
