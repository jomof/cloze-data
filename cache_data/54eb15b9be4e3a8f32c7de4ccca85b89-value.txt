    "writeup": "**その結果 (sono kekka)** is a conjunction in Japanese used to emphasize that a statement is the direct result of a preceding action or situation. The noun **結果 (kekka)** itself means \"result.\" This expression translates as \"as a result of (A),\" or \"resulting from (A).\" It is typically used at the beginning of a new sentence, where the (B) phrase highlights the result of (A). **その結果** can be used to introduce both positive and negative outcomes. The (B) part of the sentence usually focuses on a new situation or condition created due to (A).",
