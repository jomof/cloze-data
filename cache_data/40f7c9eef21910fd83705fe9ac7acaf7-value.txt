    "etymology": "The 「よう」part comes from the noun 「様 (さま)」, meaning \"way\" or \"manner.\" The particle 「に」 indicates purpose or direction.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ように」 is used to express purpose or intention, often translated as \"so that,\" \"in order to,\" or \"in such a way that.\" It indicates doing something to achieve a particular result or prevent something from happening. It is often used with verbs in the potential form (e.g., 「食べられるように」 - so that one can eat) or the negative form (e.g., 「遅れないように」 - so that one is not late). When 「ように」 is used with verbs in the potential or negative form, it implies that the speaker lacks direct control over the outcome. You are \"trying to do (A) in the manner of (B)\", but you cannot guarantee the result.",
