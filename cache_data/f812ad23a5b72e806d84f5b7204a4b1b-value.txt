    "etymology": "「物(もの)」 literally means \"thing.\" In this grammar point, it functions as a dummy noun (*keishiki meishi*, 形式名詞), indicating a general concept or characteristic. Adding 「だ」 asserts the existence or quality of that concept.",
    "writeup": "「ものだ」 is used to express general truths, expectations, or customs. It indicates that something *should* be a certain way, *is supposed* to be a certain way, or *is generally* a certain way. Think of it as highlighting the inherent nature of something. It can also express a feeling of nostalgia or reflection about past experiences.\n\nIt's often used to express things like:\n\n*   **General truths or common sense:** 「子供は元気なものだ。」 (Kids are supposed to be energetic.)\n*   **Expectations or obligations:** 「仕事は一生懸命にするものだ。」 (You should put your best effort into work.)\n*   **Customs or traditions:** 「お正月にはおせち料理を食べるものだ。」 (You eat osechi dishes during New Year's.)\n*   **Reminiscence of the past:** 「子供のころ、よくこの公園で遊んだものだ。」 (I used to often play in this park when I was a child.)\n\n「もの」 may be abbreviated as 「もん」 in casual speech, particularly among younger speakers. The negative form is 「ものではない」, which indicates that something is *not supposed to be* a certain way.",
