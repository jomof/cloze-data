    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を巡って」 is derived from the verb 「巡る (めぐる)」, which means \"to go around, to revolve, to concern\". The 「を」 particle marks the object that is being revolved around or being the focus of discussion.",
    "writeup": "「を巡って」 is a formal expression that translates to \"concerning,\" \"in regard to,\" or \"about.\" It carries a nuance of encompassing different viewpoints on a topic, often implying disagreement or dispute. It's less suitable for expressing personal opinions and more appropriate when discussing topics with multiple perspectives. The expression 「を巡って」 keeps the nuance of 「to go around the topic of (A)」 that comes from the stem verb 「巡る」.",
