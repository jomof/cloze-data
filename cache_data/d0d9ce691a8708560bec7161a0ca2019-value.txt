  "writeup": "さえ is an adverbial particle in Japanese used to emphasize a state of being.  It's often translated as 'even,' but its nuanced meaning depends heavily on context.  It highlights an unexpected or extreme example.  Think of it as showing something beyond what's normally expected.  It frequently appears with negative verbs, further emphasizing the unexpected nature.  The overall meaning often hinges on the other parts of the sentence.  While seemingly simple, mastering さえ requires understanding this subtle emphasis.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of さえ is complex and not fully understood. However, it's believed to have evolved from a combination of earlier particles, possibly related to concepts of limitation or extremity.  Its current usage reflects a refined sense of emphasis and exception.",
