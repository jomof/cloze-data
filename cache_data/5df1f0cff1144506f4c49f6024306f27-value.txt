    "etymology": "The particle 「より」 originates from the verb 「寄る (よる)」, meaning \"to approach\" or \"to come near.\" In this grammatical context, it signifies the standard to which something is approaching or being compared.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「より」 is used to make comparisons, indicating that one thing is \"more\" something than another. It directly follows the noun or verb that is being compared *to*. It's important to remember that 「より」 marks the *lower* end of the comparison; the item being compared *to*. The overall sentence expresses that the item *not* marked by 「より」 is \"more\" [adjective] than the item marked by 「より」. In many cases, 「〜のほうが」 is used in conjunction with 「より」 to emphasize the preference.",
