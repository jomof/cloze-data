  "writeup": "The sentence ending particle ましょうか (mashou ka) is a polite way to suggest an action or make a proposal.  It's formed by adding か (ka), a question particle, to ましょう (mashou), the polite volitional form of the verb ます (masu).  This subtle addition transforms the suggestion from a confident proposal ('Let's do X!') to a more tentative inquiry ('Shall we do X?').  This is significantly different from simply using ましょう, which is more of a direct proposal than a question.  While similar to ませんか (masen ka), which directly invites participation, ましょうか leans more towards a collaborative suggestion. It's commonly used in various situations, but always maintains a polite tone.  Remember, it's a suggestion, not a command, and its polite nature makes it ideal for interactions with colleagues, friends, or people you respect.",
  "etymology": "ましょうか is a combination of ましょう (mashou), the polite volitional form of the verb ます (masu), meaning 'let's', and か (ka), a question particle.  The volitional form expresses the speaker's will or intention, while か transforms it into a polite question, seeking agreement or confirmation from the listener.",
