    "etymology": "あり comes from the classical Japanese 連体形 (rentaikei or attributive form) of the verb ある (aru), meaning \"to be\" or \"to exist\". In this grammatical context, it functions to indicate the presence or possibility of something.",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Often used in casual conversation, but can also appear in more formal contexts.",
        "Function": "Indicates possibility or inclusion.",
        "Nuance": "Implies that the mentioned option is one of several possibilities.",
        "Comparison to なし": "While なし means 'without', あり means 'with' or 'including'."
    },
    "writeup": "あり is the attributive form of the verb 有る (**aru**, \"to be\", \"to exist\"). It's used to indicate that something is a possibility or is included among other options. Think of it as meaning \"with (A)\" in the sense of \"(A) is a possibility amongst others.\" This nuance of \"amongst other things\" is key, as **あり** highlights something as one viable option within a range of choices.\n\n**Key uses:**\n\n*   **Indicating possibility:**  Used when suggesting something as a potential option.\n*   **Showing inclusion:**  Highlights that something is included or available.\n*   **Agreement:**  A simple \"あり\" can be used as a response to agree with a statement or acknowledge its possibility.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   While the kanji 有り is most common, 在り might occasionally appear. The difference is subtle: **有り** emphasizes inclusion as part of a whole, while **在り** focuses on independent existence.\n*   Be mindful of the \"among other things\" implication. **あり** isn't typically used when something is the *only* option.",
