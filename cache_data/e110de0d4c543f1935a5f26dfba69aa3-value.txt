  "writeup": "The grammar point \"〜ようとしない\" expresses a reluctance or unwillingness to do something. It's formed by combining the volitional form of a verb (〜よう) with the phrase \"としない.\"  This phrase literally translates to \"and not do,\" but the nuance is more about a lack of effort or intention, rather than a simple refusal.  Think of it as \"not even trying to.\"  It's important to note that this construction usually refers to someone *other* than the speaker. Using it about yourself would sound unnatural and possibly rude.  If speaking about yourself, consider using \"〜ようと思わない\" ('I don't think I will') instead. This provides a softer, more self-referential expression of unwillingness.  The construction is versatile and can be applied to a range of verbs, creating nuanced expressions of resistance, apathy, or stubbornness.",
  "etymology": "The construction's core lies in the volitional form (よう), stemming from the verb 来る (くる, to come), signifying intent or willingness. Its negation through としない, a combination of the conjunctive と and the negative する (しない, to not do), results in the expression of unwillingness.  The と acts as a conjunction, linking the volitional intent with the subsequent action of not doing.",

      "japanese": "彼は怒っているから、誰の話も**聞こうとしない**。",
      "english": "Since he's angry, he doesn't even try to listen to anyone.",

      "japanese": "彼女は好きな男を**諦めようとしない**。",
      "english": "She's not willing to give up on the man she likes.",

      "setting": "serious",

    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの男、全然**話しかけようとしない**ね。",
      "english": "That guy, he doesn't even try to talk to me, you know?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of ね at the end is a softening particle, common in female speech, making the statement less accusatory and more conversational. The phrase 「話しかけようとしない」 directly conveys a lack of effort in initiating conversation, subtly hinting at a possible interest from the listener's perspective."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "私と少し話して**みようとしない**の？",
      "english": "Aren't you even going to try to talk to me a little?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The casual register, along with the question format and implied invitation, creates a flirtatious tone suitable for a first encounter.  The phrase 「話してみようとしない」 directly challenges the listener's lack of initiative. A female speaker may naturally use a 「higher pitch and softer tone」 to add to this nuance."

      "english": "I can't believe you won't even try this delicious food!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "nuance": "The exclamation point and the overall tone adds to the humorous feeling of disbelief. The 「こんなに美味しいものを」 emphasizes how delicious the food is, to amplify the absurdity of not trying it."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the negative connotation is key to understanding this grammar point.  It’s not simply a lack of action; it's a lack of *effort* or willingness to act.  The context is crucial for accurate interpretation.",

      "term": "ようにする",
      "meaning": "To try to, To make sure to, To endeavor to",

      "meaning": "Try to, Attempt to, To be about to",
      "kind": "antonym",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, carefully consider the nuance of intention and effort.  〜ようとしない highlights a deliberate *lack* of effort, while ようにする shows effort, and the volitional form itself expresses intent.  The context will always clarify the most appropriate choice."
