    "etymology": "でございます is a polite form of the copula, derived from で (a particle indicating state or condition) and ございます, which is the polite form of ある (to be, to exist).",
    "writeup": "でございます is a more polite version of です, functioning as a copula meaning \"to be.\" While both です and でございます are polite, でございます conveys a higher level of formality and respect. でございます is the polite form of であります, with である being the formal equivalent of だ. You might occasionally encounter でござる, the dictionary form of でございます. However, でござる is typically limited to historical dramas or characters with unique personalities. It's important to note that while using でございます to introduce yourself is very polite, using honorific language like いらっしゃる is more appropriate when referring to others.",
