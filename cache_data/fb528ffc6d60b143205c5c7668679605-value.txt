    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ように祈る」 combines 「よう」, meaning 'way' or 'manner,' with the verb 「祈る(いのる)」, 'to pray.' Thus, it literally means 'to pray in a way that...'. The 「よう」 indicates a desired outcome or state, making the whole phrase express a hope or prayer for a specific result.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ように祈る」 (yō ni inoru) is used to express a wish, hope, or prayer that something will happen. It combines the auxiliary verb 「よう」 (yō), indicating the manner or way something is done, with the verb 「祈る」 (inoru), meaning \"to pray.\" It's similar to other 「ように」 structures but specifically emphasizes the act of praying or hoping for a particular outcome. While it can be used in actual prayer, it often expresses a general hope or wish. 「ないように祈る」 is used to express a prayer for something *not* to happen.",
