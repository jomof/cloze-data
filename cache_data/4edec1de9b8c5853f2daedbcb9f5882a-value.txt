    "writeup": "に即して is a formal grammar structure used to express that something is being done to handle a matter in the best possible way, considering the circumstances. It combines the particle に with the する verb 即する (sokusuru), meaning \"to conform to\" or \"to be based on\", in its te-form.  Occasionally, に則して (nishitagatte), which also means \"in accordance with\", is used instead.\n\nThis structure is followed by a noun. When the noun directly modifies another noun, に即した is used instead of に即して. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   に即して emphasizes actions taken based on prevailing circumstances or existing situations.\n*   に則して tends to be used when actions align with established laws, policies, or standards.\n*   In modern usage, に即して is often used in both scenarios because there are situations where に則して would be incorrect.",
