  "writeup": "The Japanese expression \"なん + counter + か\" is used to express an unspecified number of things.  It translates to English as \"some,\" \"several,\" or \"a few.\"  The literal meaning is closer to \"what + counter + I wonder?,\" reflecting the speaker's uncertainty.  Instead of なん, いく (from the kanji 幾, meaning 'how many/much') can also be used, though なん is more common for counting specific items. Both 何 and 幾 are often written in hiragana, so learning both forms is crucial.  Remember that while 何 has the same kanji as なん, なん is used for counting, while なに is used for identifying things.",
  "etymology": "The particle か indicates a question or uncertainty.  Combined with 何 (nan, what) or 幾 (iku, how many), and a counter, it creates a nuanced expression conveying an imprecise quantity.  The use of counters adds specificity within the ambiguity.  The structure mirrors the way we might express uncertainty in English, such as \"a couple of...\" or \"several...\"",
