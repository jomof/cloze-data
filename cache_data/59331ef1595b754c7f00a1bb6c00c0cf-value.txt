    "etymology": "The word 「まだ」has roots that suggest incompleteness or a state of something continuing longer than expected. It conveys a sense that something is 「未だ(imada)」, or 'not yet' in the process of completion or change.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「まだ」 is versatile, generally translating to \"still\" or \"not yet\" depending on the context. The underlying meaning is that something is unexpectedly continuing. In positive sentences, 「まだ」 indicates that something is unexpectedly *still* happening or existing. In negative sentences, it indicates that something has *not yet* happened. For emphasis, it can be repeated as 「まだまだ」. 「まだ」 can also be used in questions to confirm if something is still ongoing, implying the speaker expects it might be.",
