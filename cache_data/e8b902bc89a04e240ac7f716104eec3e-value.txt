    "writeup": "「なまじ(っか)」 is an adverb that indicates that something done **halfheartedly, inadequately, or unwisely** leads to negative consequences. It expresses the idea that it would have been better not to do something at all than to do it in a deficient manner. It can also describe something that is 'a bit' or 'somewhat', but with the implication that this slightness causes problems. It often conveys a sense of regret or caution, and its usage is more formal and can sometimes sound old-fashioned. The 「～っか」 is an intensifier, emphasizing the halfhearted or inadequate nature of the action or state.",
