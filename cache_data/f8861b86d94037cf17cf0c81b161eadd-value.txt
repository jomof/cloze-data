  "writeup": "を余儀なくされる is a formal Japanese grammar pattern typically translated as \"to be forced to (A)\".  It's composed of the adverbial particle を, the noun 余儀 (another method), the conjunctive form of the い-adjective ない (なく), and the passive form of する (される). Literally, it means \"to not be given another way than to (A)\".  This construction follows a noun (A), representing the unavoidable action. The subject is usually a person or entity representing people (e.g., a company), though exceptions exist.  **Caution:** Both を余儀なくされる (\"to be forced to do\") and を余儀なくさせる (\"to force to do\") stem from the same structure, but を余儀なくさせる will be covered separately.  Interestingly, while 余儀 and ない are distinct words, 余儀なく is often treated as a single unit meaning \"unavoidably\" or \"inevitably.\"",
  "etymology": "The grammar point combines several existing elements.  余儀 (yōgi) means 'another method' or 'alternative,' while なく (naku) is the negative conjunctive form of ない (nai, 'not').  The passive form される (sareru) adds the sense of being subjected to an action. Combining these conveys the sense of having no other choice but to perform the action.",

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「あなた」(anata) is slightly more formal than 「君」(kimi), but still fits well within the context of an early encounter. The informal 「しまう」(shimau) adds a subtle nuance of being slightly overwhelmed by feelings and having little control over one's actions which gives this casual remark an effect of sweet and subtle flirtation. The phrase 「もっと話したいと余儀なくされてしまう」(motto hanashitai to yōginaku sarete shimau) creates the effect of a charmingly helpless feeling of compulsion."
