    "etymology": "The particle 「を」 was originally used more broadly, but over time its functions have narrowed. In this context, it signifies the *path* or *area* traversed during an action, distinguishing it from the destination (which would typically use 「に」 or 「へ」).",
    "writeup": "The particle 「を」 indicates movement *through* or *across* a space. It's used with verbs of motion like 「歩く」(walk), 「飛ぶ」(fly), 「走る」(run), 「通る」(pass through), and 「曲がる」(turn). It emphasizes the path or area traversed during the action, rather than the destination. Unlike 「に」 or 「へ」, which indicate a destination, 「を」 specifies *where* the movement occurs. For example, 「公園を通って」(koen wo tootte) means \"passing *through* the park,\" focusing on the act of going *through* the park itself.",
