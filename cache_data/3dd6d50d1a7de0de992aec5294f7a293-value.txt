    "etymology": "「あの」 is derived from the demonstrative series 「あ」 (a-series), which indicates distance from both the speaker and the listener. It shares its root with 「あれ」 (that over there) and 「あそこ」 (over there).",
    "writeup": "「あの」 is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞) in Japanese. These words don't conjugate, always appearing in the same form. 「あの」, from the 「あ」 family like 「あれ」 and 「あそこ」, identifies something away from both speaker and listener, translated as \"that\" (thing over there). As a pre-noun adjectival, it always precedes and describes a noun.",
