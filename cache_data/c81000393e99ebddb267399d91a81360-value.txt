    "details": {
        "Register": "Varies depending on the politeness of the verb/adjective used before 「ことがある」. Usually informal unless 「あります」is used.",
        "Usage": "This grammar point indicates that something happens from time to time, but not regularly. It can be used with verbs, adjectives, and nouns.",

    },
    "writeup": "「ことがある」 indicates that something happens occasionally. It's used to describe events or actions that occur from time to time, but not on a regular basis. The level of formality depends on the verb or adjective preceding 「ことがある」; using 「あります」 makes it more polite. For nouns, you can use 「のことがある」 or 「であることがある」, with 「である」 being more formal.",
    "etymology": "「こと」 (koto) means 'thing' or 'event,' 「が」 (ga) is a particle indicating the subject, and 「ある」 (aru) means 'to exist' or 'to happen.' Thus, 「ことがある」 literally means 'there is an event'.",
