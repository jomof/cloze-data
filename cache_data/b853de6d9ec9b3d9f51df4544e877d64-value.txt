  "writeup": "しかない is a versatile Japanese expression, often paired with verbs. It combines しか, an adverbial particle, and the い-adjective ない.  This structure translates as 'to have no choice but (A)' or 'there is only (A)'.  The crucial nuance is that しかない emphasizes the **exclusivity** of option (A); no other possibilities exist.  To use it, simply attach it to the plain, non-past form of the verb. Unlike だけ, which suggests a choice was made from several options, しかない implies a lack of alternatives, carrying a stronger implication of constraint or circumstance.  It suggests that the circumstances have forced the speaker's hand.  A fun fact:  In informal contexts like manga or anime, you might see the contraction っきゃない, but this is uncommon in everyday speech.",

    {
      "japanese": "人が多いから、並ぶ**しかない**。",
      "english": "Because there are so many people, I have no choice but to wait in line.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the plain form of しかない, suitable for casual conversation.  The 「多い」 highlights the reason for the limitation, making the speaker's action feel less like a direct choice and more a response to the environment."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "時間がないので、タクシーに乗る**しかない**です。",
      "english": "I don't have much time, so I have no choice but to take a taxi.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The polite ending 「です」 elevates the register. The simple structure still conveys the restrictive nature of the situation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "今すぐ行かないと、遅刻する**しかない**よ！",
      "english": "If I don't go right now, I'll have no choice but to be late!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "exclamatory",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The use of 「よ」 adds emphasis and a sense of urgency, common in casual speech among close friends.  The 「今すぐ」 emphasizes the urgency further."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "もう閉まっているから、明日来る**しかない**ね。",
      "english": "It's already closed, so there's nothing to do but come tomorrow.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "This uses 「ね」 to confirm the speaker's feeling with the listener and to soften the statement."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "こんなに可愛いあなたに、恋してしまう**しかない**です！",
      "english": "With you being so cute, I have no choice but to fall in love!",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「です」 is used, yet the sentence itself is a bold declaration of feeling.  The phrase 「可愛いあなた」 is a direct compliment that is typically used when flirting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたと会えて、本当に嬉しい。他のことは何も考えられない…あなたと話す**しかない**。",
      "english": "I'm so happy to have met you. I can't think of anything else... I have no choice but to talk to you.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses a semi-formal tone which shows polite interest without being overly formal. The phrase 「あなたと話す」 clearly conveys the speaker's desire for further interaction.  The emotion is directly conveyed by the statement 「本当に嬉しい」."
    }
  ],
  "etymology": "The structure of しかない is quite straightforward.  しか is a limiting particle, indicating 'only', and ない is the negative form of the copula verb ある (to be).  The combination thus directly conveys the idea of a single remaining option."
