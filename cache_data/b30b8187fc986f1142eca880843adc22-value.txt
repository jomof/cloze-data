  "writeup": "The Japanese grammatical particle ないで (nai de) is a versatile tool expressing actions performed 'without doing' something else.  It's a combination of the negative form ない (nai) and the particle で (de), which here indicates the manner or means of the action.  The overall nuance often suggests an unexpected or counter-intuitive sequence of events, implying that the absence of the first action is notable in relation to the second.  For example, \"ご飯を食べないで寝た\" (gohan o tabenaide neta) means 'I went to bed without eating dinner,' highlighting the unusual omission of dinner before sleep.  While similar in meaning to なくて (nakute), ないで often emphasizes the action performed *despite* the omission of the preceding action.  Mastering its subtle usage adds a level of fluency to your Japanese.",
  "etymology": "ないで (nai de) is a compound particle formed from the negative form of the verb ない (nai, 'not') and the particle で (de, indicating manner, means, or accompaniment). The combination expresses performing an action 'in the manner of not doing' something else. This shows a clear grammatical evolution, combining a verb ending with a particle to express a nuanced meaning.",
