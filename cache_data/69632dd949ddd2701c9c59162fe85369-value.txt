  "writeup": "The phrase は言うまでもない (wa iu made mo nai) is a common expression used to state the obvious.  It literally translates to something like \"as for saying it, even to that extent, it's unnecessary.\"  The structure combines the topic-marking particle は (wa), the verb 言う (iu, 'to say'), the particles まで (made, 'even to') and も (mo, 'also/even'), and the negative adjective ない (nai, 'not').  This construction emphasizes that the preceding statement is self-evident and requires no further explanation.  It's often followed by a clarifying phrase, but that addition isn't strictly necessary to create meaning.  While versatile, it's most commonly found in situations that call for a straightforward presentation of uncontested facts. The formality remains standard in most situations.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of は言うまでもない reflects the combination of its constituent parts.  言う (iu, 'to say') is a basic verb with ancient roots. まで (made, 'until, even to') and も (mo, 'also, even') are particles that add emphasis and scope.  The negative ない (nai) adds the essential nuance of 'unnecessary' or 'needless'.  The overall structure likely developed organically over time, from frequent use of these component parts in similar contexts.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a straightforward, matter-of-fact tone, suitable for a semi-formal setting like a casual conversation among colleagues or acquaintances. The use of は (wa) sets the topic \"his grades are the best in the class\" for discussion."

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The polite register (丁寧語 teineigo) and the phrase 「あなたの心も美しいのです」('your heart is also beautiful') are both ways to add a touch of romance to the otherwise straightforward statement.  The speaker's politeness here shows his respect for the listener. The sentence implies that inner beauty is more important than mere physical beauty, which is a common romantic sentiment."

      "conjugation": null,

      "term": "言うまでもない ②",
      "meaning": "It goes without saying, It is needless to say, Of course, Obviously",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While both phrases convey the same core idea of something being obvious,  言うまでもない ① emphasizes the unnecessary act of stating the obvious, whereas 言うまでもない ② is a more succinct and direct assertion of obviousness."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The difference lies in the implied emphasis.  言うまでもない ① highlights the redundancy of stating the fact, whereas 言うまでもない ② simply states the obviousness. Choose based on the level of emphasis you wish to convey.  In most everyday situations, the simpler 言うまでもない ② works perfectly well."
