  "writeup": "The particle です (desu) is a polite form of the copula だ (da).  It indicates that something *is* a certain way or *exists*. Unlike だ, which is informal and primarily used in casual speech, です is essential for polite conversation.  While だ can only be used with na-adjectives and nouns, です is used far more widely.  It's considered grammatically correct to use です with い-adjectives in informal speech, however some older texts or stricter grammar guides may still consider this incorrect. In modern usage however, most people will find it to be acceptable.   Mastering です is fundamental to speaking polite Japanese.  Its usage is extremely widespread across all aspects of life and it is simply essential for the beginner Japanese learner to master.",
  "etymology": "です is a contraction of であります (de arimasu), where で (de) is a particle indicating a state of being, あります (arimasu) is the polite form of ある (aru, to exist). The contraction reflects the natural tendency towards brevity and politeness in Japanese speech.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that です is always used with nouns and na-adjectives, but it's acceptable in spoken Japanese to use it with i-adjectives as well.
