    "writeup": "The grammar point 「に沿って」 (にそって) is formed by the particle 「に」 and the て-form of the verb 「沿う」 (そう), meaning \"to run alongside\" or \"to follow\".  It expresses the idea of acting or moving in accordance with something, be it a physical path, a rule, a plan, or someone's wishes.  The nuance is that the action or state described by the verb is guided or determined by the noun preceding 「に」. This construction is generally considered **formal** and is often used in business, official documents, and academic settings. When used literally, referring to following a physical path, it is more common in everyday speech. Think of it like tracing a line or adhering closely to a set of guidelines.",
    "etymology": "The verb 「沿う」(そう) combines the kanji 「沿」 meaning \"run along, follow along, adhere to\" with the verbal suffix 「う」.  The addition of the particle 「に」 and the て-form 「沿って」 creates an adverbial phrase indicating the manner in which an action is performed.",
