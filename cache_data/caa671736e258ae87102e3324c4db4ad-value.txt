    "etymology": "The construction is built from: 「の」 (nominalizer), 「は」 (topic marker), 「方」 (direction/side) and 「だ」 (copula). Literally, it means \"the one on the side of X,\" which implies something more nuanced than a direct assertion.",
    "writeup": "「のはXの方だ」 is used to emphasize that X is the one responsible for or associated with a certain action or situation. It highlights a particular element or person, often against the backdrop of other possibilities or expectations. It's useful for gently pointing out who is the main actor in a given scenario, for example: \n\n*   \"The one who broke the cup is Takeru!\"\n*   \"I'm the one who wanted to invite Sakamoto.\"\n\nThe grammar point consists of:\n\n*   「のは」: Nominalizes a phrase, turning it into a noun clause.\n*   「方だ」: Indicates \"the one on the side of,\" subtly assigning responsibility or association.\n\nOften, this pattern is used apologetically to express that someone feels they are the one responsible for a certain outcome.",
