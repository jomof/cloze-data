    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 originally indicated a connection or togetherness. Over time, it evolved to express various relationships, including 'with'. Its fundamental meaning implies a connection or association between two or more things.",
    "writeup": "This lesson focuses on the common translation of 「と」 as \"with.\"  It indicates a relationship between (A) and (B), whether translated as \"and\" or \"with.\" Nouns marked with 「と」 are usually performing a mutual action, even if that action is simply co-existing. When 「と」 means \"with\", it implies equal involvement in the action.  In contrast, 「に」 highlights that one person is the target of an action, suggesting a more one-sided interaction. For example, 「トムと話す」 means \"I talk with Tom\" implying a mutual conversation.  「トムに話す」 means \"I talk to Tom,\" suggesting Tom might not be actively participating.",
