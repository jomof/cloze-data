    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なく」 is a continuative form of 「ない」 primarily used in **written Japanese and formal speech**. It functions similarly to 「～なくて」, but with a more literary feel. When attached to an い-adjective, it takes the form of \"[adjective stem] + くなく\". For な-adjectives and nouns, it uses 「ではなく」.\n\nIt has two main functions:\n\n*   **Reason/Cause**: Indicates a reason or cause for the subsequent statement. Similar to saying \"not A, and as a result...\"\n*   **Contrast**: Indicates a contrast, meaning \"not A, but B.\"",
    "etymology": "「なく」 originates as the continuative form of the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」. Its use in modern Japanese preserves this function, indicating a continuation from a state of \"not being.\"",
