  "writeup": "やがる is a fascinating colloquial auxiliary verb, primarily used informally by men.  It attaches to the *masu-stem* (dictionary form without -masu) or the *te-form* of verbs, expressing a strong feeling of annoyance, disdain, or disgust towards the action performed by someone else.  Think of it as adding a layer of frustrated incredulity. The literal meaning relates to 'to rise' or 'to become complete,' but the implication here is very different. It suggests that the speaker finds the action audacious, impertinent, or simply infuriating. While directly translating it can be tricky, rendering it as \"to have the nerve to,\" \"to have the gall to,\" or \"to freaking\" often captures the intended nuance.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of やがる traces back to the verb 上がる (agaru), meaning \"to go up\" or \"to rise.\"  However, its usage with やがる has evolved to express a sense of irritation or anger towards the subject's actions, completely diverging from its original meaning.  The added -がる (-garu) suffix contributes to the informal, almost indignant tone.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "あいつ、俺に嘘をつき**やがった**！",
      "english": "That guy had the nerve to lie to me!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": "past (plain)",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「俺」 (ore) and 「つきやがった」 (tsukiyagatta) clearly marks this as a sentence spoken by a male speaker expressing anger towards the actions of another.  The past tense emphasizes the completed and thus, infuriating action."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの居酒屋、ぼったくりを**しやがる**。",
      "english": "That izakaya is a freaking rip-off.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The casual register, marked by the use of  「あの」 (ano) and the plain form 「しやがる」(shiyagaru), makes this comment sound like a casual complaint among peers. There's a strong emotional implication in the choice of verb."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの野郎、俺にそんなこと教え**やがった**！",
      "english": "That bastard had the gall to tell me that!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "angry",
      "conjugation": "past (plain)",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "Again, 「俺」(ore) indicates a male speaker, and the use of the harsher 「野郎」(yarou) shows anger and contempt.  The past tense 「やがった」(yagatta) highlights the completed action as the source of annoyance."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼女、私の誕生日を忘れ**やがった**！",
      "english": "She had the nerve to forget my birthday!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "melancholic",
      "conjugation": "past (plain)",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "While 「やがった」(yagatta) is used, the choice of 「彼女」(kanojo) and the overall tone, while still annoyed, makes it slightly softer than male usage. The context matters; this disappointment could be directed at a close friend or partner.  This illustrates how while men primarily use this grammar point, women can too, with adjustments to other elements."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "おい、さっきから私のことずっと見て**やがって**！",
      "english": "Hey! You've been staring at me since a while ago!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "te-form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「おい」(oi) is assertive and the te-form 「やがって」(yagatte) adds a playful edge, especially in a flirty context.  The 「ずっと」(zutto) adds to the teasing intensity of the sentence. This shows how seemingly negative grammar points can be applied positively based on context."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the appropriate usage of やがる hinges on context and your relationship with the listener. While generally considered informal and masculine, with careful consideration, you can successfully incorporate it into various conversational scenarios, particularly to playfully express frustration or annoyance. Misuse can lead to offense, so proceed with caution."
