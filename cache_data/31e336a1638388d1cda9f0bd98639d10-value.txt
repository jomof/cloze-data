  "writeup": "再び is an adverb that means 'to repeat'. It's commonly translated as 'again', 'once more', or 'a second time'.  Typically, 再び appears at the beginning of a sentence, preceding a request or statement about what needs repeating.  While it means 'to repeat', 再び carries the nuance of repeating something *specifically for the second time*.  Therefore, it's not used for actions repeated numerous times.  Unlike また, frequently used to mean 'again', 再び is quite formal and more common in written materials like books and articles than in everyday speech.",
  "etymology": "The word 再び is composed of two parts: 再 (sai), meaning 'again' or 're-', and び (bi), a suffix that adds emphasis or nuance to a word. The combination creates a more formal and nuanced way to convey the idea of repetition.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "彼は刑務所から出て、再び犯罪を犯した。",
      "english": "After leaving prison, he committed a crime again.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「再び」, emphasizing the second instance of the crime.  The formal register suits the objective reporting of a fact."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "私は、再びあの美しい景色を見たい。",
      "english": "I want to see that beautiful scenery again.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「再び」 adds a sense of longing for a past experience, making it slightly more emphatic than using また.  The semi-formal register is appropriate for expressing a personal desire."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "もう一度、君に会いたい。",
      "english": "I want to see you again.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "「もう一度」is a more casual way of expressing the same desire.  This phrasing, along with the setting, allows for a more intimate and romantic tone. The male speaker using this to a female listener shows interest."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの映画を、再び観たいんだけど…",
      "english": "I'd like to watch that movie again, but...",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "casual",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「再び」 is slightly less common in casual conversation compared to また, but still works here to emphasize the desire for a second viewing.  The trailing 'but...' implies a potential obstacle."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "先生、その問題を再び説明していただけませんか？",
      "english": "Teacher, could you explain that problem again?",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "academic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite register 「先生」 and the use of 「再び」 show respect for the teacher and a desire for clarification in a formal setting.  It highlights the need for a second explanation."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Note that while 再び can be used in various contexts, its inherent formality makes it less suitable for casual conversations.  また is a more versatile alternative for general use.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "更に",
      "meaning": "Even more or further, Again, More and more",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike 再び, which emphasizes a second instance, 更に implies a continuation or increase beyond a previous point.  It suggests adding to something rather than simply repeating it."
    },
    {
      "term": "また",
      "meaning": "Also, As well, Moreover, Again, Additionally",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "また is a much more versatile and commonly used word for 'again'.  It lacks the formal tone and specific nuance of a second time repetition inherent in 再び."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 再び emphasizes a second occurrence specifically, while 更に implies additional continuation or increase. また is the general term for 'again' and is appropriate for most situations unless you need to emphasize a strict second repetition in a formal register."
