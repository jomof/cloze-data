  "meaning": "Something is finished, to finish something, something has come to an end, to do something completely, to do something through",

  "writeup": "The verbs 上がる (agaru) and 上げる (ageru), meaning \"to rise\" and \"to raise,\" respectively, take on a nuanced meaning when used after the conjunctive form of another verb.  They indicate completion or thoroughness of an action.  **上がる** is intransitive (the action happens on its own), while **上げる** is transitive (someone performs the action).  The nuance often translates to \"to do (A) to the point of completion\" or \"to do (A) through to the end.\" The 'limit' emphasizes a natural conclusion rather than resource depletion.  This is often seen when an effect or product results from the action. In such cases, \"to (A) up\" closely resembles \"to finish up (A)\" in English.  Be cautious with 仕上がる (shiagaru), a common expression indicating completion after a complex or lengthy process.",
  "etymology": "Both 上がる and 上げる derive from the kanji 上 (ue), meaning \"up\" or \"above.\"  上がる indicates a rising or increasing state, while 上げる describes the act of actively raising something. The -がる suffix often implies an involuntary or inherent tendency towards a state, whereas the -げる suffix suggests a deliberate action.",

      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The casual register, 「は」 instead of 「は？」, reflects a friendly and somewhat informal interaction between an older and younger person in an academic setting. The past tense shows that the speaker believes the report's status is known."
