    "writeup": "**何より** expresses feelings of happiness, relief, or emphasizes that something is \"more important than anything else.\" The literal translation is close to \"more than anything, (A).\" It's used to express positive feelings, especially when a situation could have been worse. **何より** often functions adverbially, appearing at the beginning of a sentence or before the word it modifies. When followed by **の**, it can come directly before a noun. Adding **も** to the phrase, as in **何よりも**, strengthens the expression without changing its core meaning.",
    "etymology": "**何より** is composed of 何 (nani), meaning \"what\" or \"whatever,\" and より (yori), a particle meaning \"than.\" Thus, the phrase literally translates to \"more than what/anything.\"",
