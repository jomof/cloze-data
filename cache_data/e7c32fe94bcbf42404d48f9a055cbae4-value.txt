  "writeup": "The phrase \"の極み\" (no kiwami) translates to \"the ultimate,\" \"the extreme,\" \"the epitome of,\" or \"the peak of.\"  It's a formal expression used to emphasize the intensity or degree of a noun.  It literally means 'the extremity of'.  The structure is always:  [Noun] の 極み.  The noun describes what is being taken to its extreme.  This grammatical construction is often followed by the copula だ (da) or the particle で (de) to further elaborate on the result or consequence of that extreme state.  'の極み' is specifically used with nouns;  avoid using it with verbs or adjectives.  For those, consider the related expressions 極まる (kiwamareru) or 極まりない (kiwamari nai).",
