  "writeup": "The conjunction それに is understood as a single word, but it's more accurately a combination of the pronoun それ (sore—that) and the particle に (ni—to, in, on, at).  The それ refers to the preceding clause or sentence, while に indicates the addition of further information.  Therefore, a literal translation could be 'and to that' or 'and on that,' where 'that' represents the previously stated information.  Common translations include 'moreover,' 'in addition,' or simply 'and.'  Because に adds information, the information following それに must logically extend or follow from the preceding information.  It typically presents information with consistently positive or consistently negative connotations; mixing positive and negative information after それに is unnatural.",
  "etymology": "それに is a combination of the demonstrative pronoun それ (sore, 'that') and the particle に (ni, indicating a direction or addition).  The use of に emphasizes the additive nature of the information following それに, showing a continuation or expansion of the preceding thought.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "今日はいい天気ですね。**それに**風が気持ちいいです。",
      "english": "It's nice weather today. Besides, the wind feels good.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses polite language, suitable for a friendly conversation.  The use of 「いい天気ですね」 (ii tenki desu ne) and 「風が気持ちいいです」 (kaze ga kimochi ii desu) shows positive continuation of the thought. "
    },
    {
      "japanese": "宿題が終わった。**それに**もう寝たい。",
      "english": "I finished my homework.  And besides, I want to sleep already.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses casual speech. The use of 「もう寝たい」 (mō netai) shows a natural continuation from finishing homework.  The speaker's intention to sleep after completing their task makes this use of それに perfectly natural."

      "japanese": "彼はイケメンで、**それに**お金持ちなんだって！",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「イケメン」 (ikemen) and 「お金持ち」 (okane mochi) are both positive aspects, making the use of それに appropriate. The exclamation point at the end shows excitement. 「なんだって！」 (nandatte!) is a common exclamation among female speakers."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "映画はつまらなかった。**それに**長かった。",
      "english": "The movie was boring. And on top of that, it was long.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "pessimistic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Both aspects of the movie are negative; this shows appropriate usage. 「つまらなかった」 (tsumaranakatta) and 「長かった」 (nagattakata) are common ways to say the movie was boring and long. "

      "japanese": "このレストランは雰囲気がいいし、**それに**料理も美味しい。",

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Both 「雨が降っている」 (ame ga futteiru) and 「風が強い」 (kaze ga tsuyoi) create a negative image. The suggestion to stay indoors follows naturally."

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The speaker is describing positive qualities of a woman to another male listener.  The use of 「んです」 (n desu) softens the statement, making it polite and appropriate for a first encounter. 「綺麗で」 (kirei de) and 「性格もいい」 (seikaku mo ii) are positive descriptions, which naturally extends the sentence using それに."

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the nuance of それに lies in its additive function. It smoothly links related information, enhancing the flow and impact of your sentences.  Mastering this delicate point will make your Japanese sound much more natural and sophisticated.",

      "meaning": "Besides, In addition, Furthermore",
      "kind": "synonym",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the subtle differences in connotation.  Use それに for smoothly adding related information, おまけに for an additional point (often negative), なお for formal writing, また for general additions, しかも for surprising additions, and その上 for accumulating facts. すると introduces a consequence.  Choose the conjunction that best suits the context and desired nuance."
