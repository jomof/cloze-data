    "etymology": "The word 「なまじ」 comes from 「生(なま)」 meaning raw or incomplete, combined with 「～し」, an adverbial suffix. The 「～っか」 is an emphatic suffix, adding more weight to the statement. Thus, the etymology reflects the core meaning of something being incomplete or insufficient.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「なまじ(っか)」 indicates that something is done in a half-hearted, inadequate, or thoughtless way, often resulting in a negative consequence. It suggests that it might have been better not to do something at all than to do it poorly. It is often used to express regret or caution about actions taken without sufficient preparation or commitment. 「なまじ」 can also modify nouns with 「の」 or 「な」, emphasizing the inadequacy of the noun. The 「～っか」 adds emphasis but doesn't change the core meaning.",
