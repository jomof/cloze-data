  "writeup": "The phrase はさておき (wasateoki) or はさておいて (wasateoite) is a versatile expression often translated as \"leaving aside (A)\", \"apart from (A)\", or \"disregarding (A)\". It's a combination of the topic-marking particle は (wa), the conjunction さて (sate, meaning 'now' or 'well'), and the conjunctive form of 置く (oku, meaning 'to put' or 'to place'), おき (oki) or おいて (oite).  The more literal translation, \"now putting aside (A)\", also accurately reflects its usage.  This structure is employed when the speaker wants to shift focus from a less important topic (A) to something more significant.  はさておき typically follows nouns directly. However, it frequently appears after phrases ending in かどうか (kadouka, meaning 'whether or not'), creating the nuanced meaning of 'disregarding whether it is (A) or not, (B),' implying (B) is the more pertinent matter.  It's important to note that さて (sate) might rarely appear in its kanji forms 扨 or 扠, and 置く (oku) can be substituted with 措く (okoku) with the same meaning of 'to set aside'. The common expression 冗談はさておき (joudan wa sateoki) means 'jokes aside' or 'seriously speaking'.",
