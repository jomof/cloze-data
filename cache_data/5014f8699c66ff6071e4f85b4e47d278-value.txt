  "writeup": "かなり is an adverb used to express a significant degree or amount.  It's often translated as \"quite,\" \"fairly,\" \"considerably,\" or \"pretty.\"  It typically precedes the phrase or noun it modifies.  Interestingly, かなり originally stemmed from 可也 and later 可成, both meaning something akin to \"to become undeniable.\" This reflects its modern usage: highlighting the undeniable extent or presence of something.  This older meaning subtly adds nuance, conveying that the amount or existence has reached an undeniable level, regardless of whether it's positive or negative.",
  "etymology": "The adverb かなり comes from the older forms 可也 (karya) and 可成 (kanari).  可 means 'possible,' 'can,' or 'suitable,' while 也 (ya) is an archaic verb ending indicating that something has become certain. 成 (naru) is a more recent version of the verb 'to become.' Both 可也 and 可成 carry a sense of something reaching a point of undeniable certainty.",
