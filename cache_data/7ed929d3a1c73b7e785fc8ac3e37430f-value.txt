    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に相違ない」 comes from 「相違(そうい)」 meaning \"difference\" or \"discrepancy,\" and 「ない」, meaning \"not.\" Thus, literally, it means \"there is no discrepancy,\" implying a strong certainty or conviction.",
    "writeup": "「に相違ない」 is used to express a strong conviction that something is true or certain. It's similar to 「に違いない」, but more formal. Use it to emphatically state your opinion or agree with someone else's point of view. 「に相違ない」 can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. You'll often see it after 「から」, to emphasize that there's no mistaking the reason for something. However, be aware that this grammar is quite formal; 「に違いない」 is usually preferred in everyday conversation.",
