    "etymology": "「こう」 (kou) means \"this way\" or \"like this\". 「した」 (shita) is the past tense form of the verb 「する」 (suru), which means \"to do\". Therefore, 「こうした」 literally means \"did like this\" or \"happened like this\", implying a preceding action or example.",
    "writeup": "「こうした」 is a demonstrative adjective that means \"like this\" or \"such\". It's used to refer to something that has already been mentioned, demonstrated, or is generally understood in the context of the conversation. It often appears before a noun to describe something similar to what was previously discussed. For example, 「こうした問題」 (koushita mondai) means \"this kind of problem\" or \"such a problem\". It implies that the problem being referred to is similar to a problem that has already been discussed.",
