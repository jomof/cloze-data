    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of several elements: の (a nominalizer turning a clause into a noun), ではない (the negative form of the copula だ), だろう (a conjecture or probability marker), and か (a question marker). Thus, it literally translates to 'Is it probably not the case that...?'",
    "writeup": "のではないだろうか is a grammar pattern in Japanese that is used to express an opinion indirectly, often as a rhetorical question. Common translations include \"I think it's (A), isn't it?\" and \"it might be that (A).\" The phrase combines の (a nominalizer), ではない ('isn't'), だろう ('probably'), and か (a question marker). Literally, it means something like \"is it probably not that it's (A)?\" Similar to English, the length of the phrase and the lack of certainty make it sound more modest. のではないだろうか can follow verbs and い-adjectives directly, or な-adjectives and nouns when preceded by な. Additionally, でしょう may replace だろう for a more polite tone. This phrase can also be used when seeking agreement from the listener or mildly persuading them that your viewpoint is correct.",
