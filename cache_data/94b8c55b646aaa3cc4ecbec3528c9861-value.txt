    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てよかった」 is derived from the combination of the 「て」 form of a verb and 「よかった」, which is the past form of the adjective 「いい」 (good). The 「て」 form connects the action with the feeling of 'goodness' or satisfaction about the result.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てよかった」 expresses a feeling of relief or satisfaction that something happened or was done. It's equivalent to saying \"I'm glad that...\" in English. It can also express relief that something *didn't* happen, using the negative form 「なくてよかった」 or 「ないでよかった」.\n\n*   「てよかった」 (te yokatta): I'm glad that (something happened).\n*   「なくてよかった」 (nakute yokatta): I'm glad that (something didn't happen). This form is more formal.\n*   「ないでよかった」 (naide yokatta): I'm glad that (something didn't happen). This form is more casual.\n\nWhile both 「なくてよかった」 and 「ないでよかった」 express relief that something didn't happen, 「ないでよかった」 is more common in casual speech. 「なくてよかった」 is sometimes reserved for more formal or written contexts.",
