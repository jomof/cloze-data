  "writeup": "The phrase てもいい (temo ii) is a versatile Japanese construction expressing permissibility or acceptance.  It literally translates to \"even if ~, it's okay.\"  It's used with nouns, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives,  adapting its form accordingly. For い-adjectives, remember to use the -ku form (e.g., 高い → 高くてもいい). This phrase often functions as a polite way to ask permission or offer alternatives.  The particle も (mo) emphasizes the inclusiveness—'even if' this condition is met, it's still fine.  Omitting も makes the statement more direct and is suitable only for close relationships.  The underlying structure is simple:  [adjective/noun] + て + も + いい. Mastering this construction opens up nuanced ways to express flexibility and acceptance in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The etymology is straightforward.  いい (ii) means 'good' or 'okay'. て (te) is the continuative form, showing a state or action. も (mo) is the particle indicating 'also' or 'even.'  The combination signifies that even under a given condition, the outcome is still acceptable.",

      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The use of \"よ\" (yo) at the end is typical of casual speech between younger people, particularly among friends.  The sentence is concise and avoids formality."

      "conjugation": "polite",
      "speaker_age": "older",

      "nuance": "The polite ending \"ですか\" (desuka) shows respect, fitting for someone older asking a younger person for permission.  The phrasing is indirect and avoids direct demands."

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of  「構いませんよ」(kamaimasen yo) is a softer, more polite way of saying it's okay, adding a touch of femininity to the speech. The particle \"よ\" (yo) makes it somewhat casual for a female speaker."

      "nuance": "「別に誰でもいいんだけど」(Betuni dare demo iin dakedo) softens the second part, which is a compliment; it feels less direct. The phrase 「君がいいな」(kimi ga ii na) is characteristically masculine and flirtatious."

      "nuance": "Unlike てもいい, which emphasizes acceptance, てもかまわない is more neutral, suggesting indifference."

      "term": "ても",
      "nuance": "ても simply means \"even if.\" It lacks the permission or acceptance implied by てもいい."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "Distinguishing these similar phrases depends on the intended emphasis.  Use てもいい to clearly signal acceptance or permission; use てもかまわない for a more neutral stance; and use ても for simple concession without implied acceptance.  Context and the desired level of politeness will dictate the most appropriate choice."
