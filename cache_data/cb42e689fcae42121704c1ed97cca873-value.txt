  "writeup": "The phrase \"はずがない\" (hazu ga nai) expresses a strong sense of improbability or impossibility.  It literally translates to something closer to '(something) is not the only possibility,' implying that while not entirely impossible, the event in question is highly unlikely. It's derived from \"はず\" (hazu), meaning 'supposed to' or 'expected to',  combined with the negative form of the verb \"ある\" (aru, to exist).  The particle \"が\" (ga) marks the subject. This nuance is crucial; it doesn't categorically deny the possibility, unlike a stronger negation like \"不可能だ\" (fukanō da).  Understanding this subtle difference is key to mastering its usage.  The expression is versatile and applies to various situations, from casual conversations to more formal settings.",
  "etymology": "The core of this grammar point lies in the word \"はず\" (hazu).  This word originates from the kanji 筈, which depicts a notch or hook used to secure something.  This visual representation conveys the idea of something being securely 'bound' or 'expected' to be true.  Therefore, \"はずがない\" negates this expectation, suggesting that the event in question is not bound or secured in the realm of certainty.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "そんなに早く走ったのだから、息切れする**はずがない**。",
      "english": "Since you ran so fast, it's hardly possible you aren't out of breath.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The casual register is evident in the use of のだから (nodakara), a casual reason marker. The older speaker is offering an explanation to the younger listener, a common dynamic where the older person might use a slightly condescending yet informative tone. 「息切れするはずがない」 (ikigire suru hazu ga nai) is the core expression, conveying a sense of improbability without outright denial."

    {
      "japanese": "こんなに勉強したんだから、試験に落ちる**はずがない**よ。",
      "english": "I've studied so hard, there's no way I'll fail the test.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "optimistic",
      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the casual ending よ (yo), and だって (datte) is a typical casual conjunction.  The female speaker is expressing confidence to another female, suggesting a close friendship. 「落ちるはずがない」 (ochiru hazu ga nai) expresses firm belief in success. This is a typical self-affirmation frequently used by younger females."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "そんな簡単な問題だから、間違える**はずがない**でしょう。",
      "english": "It's such a simple question; you shouldn't have made a mistake.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": "polite negative",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The polite form でしょう (deshō) softens the implication of the speaker's slight disapproval toward the listener's mistake. The elder speaker uses a slightly formal register, 「間違えるはずがないでしょう」 (machigaeru hazu ga nai deshou), indicating a hint of guidance or correction toward a younger person.  The politeness is not overly formal, fitting a semi-formal setting."

      "english": "I don't think he would ever do such a thing.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the formal expression 私は思っています (watashi wa omotteimasu), making it suitable for more serious or formal situations. The structure emphasizes that the speaker firmly believes in the improbability of the event. The use of 「するはずがない」 (suru hazu ga nai) expresses a strong degree of conviction."

    {
      "japanese": "彼の誠実さからして、嘘をつく**はずがない**。",

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "persuasive",
      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "nuance": "The formal tone is evident in the sentence structure and vocabulary.  The use of からして (karashite) is slightly more formal than simple から (kara). The plain negative form of 「はずがない」 (hazu ga nai) is used here to convey a strong statement, while retaining the formality."

      "japanese": "私をそんな風に見ている**はずがない**よ…　だって、好きでしょ？",

      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The intimate register is clear in the use of よ (yo) and だって (datte), and the slightly suggestive nature of the question. 「私をそんな風に見ているはずがない」 (watashi o sonna fuu ni mite iru hazu ga nai) uses the plain form to directly express a playfully incredulous tone. This kind of suggestive, almost accusatory flirting is often used by younger women to test the waters with their romantic interests."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "こんな時間なのに、彼がまだ起きている**はずがない**。",
      "english": "It's this late; there's no way he's still awake.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "nuance": "The casual register is set by the use of のに (noni), a casual conjunction indicating a contrast. The speaker is making a deduction based on common sense and their own knowledge. 「起きているはずがない」 (okiteiru hazu ga nai) confidently expresses the speaker's belief that the event is improbable."
    }

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while \"はずがない\" strongly suggests improbability, it doesn't express absolute impossibility. The context and the speaker's confidence level determine the precise strength of the negation.  Consider using stronger negations, such as \"絶対に～ない\" (zettai ni ~nai) for complete certainty.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to distinguishing these phrases lies in understanding the core meaning of each.  \"はずがない\" specifically negates an expected outcome, expressing improbability. Other phrases, such as \"わけがない\" or \"ものか,\" might express absolute impossibility or forceful rejection. Carefully consider the context and the degree of certainty you wish to convey when selecting the appropriate expression."
