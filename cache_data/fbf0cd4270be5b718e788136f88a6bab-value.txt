    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ませんか」 is derived from the ます form of a verb, negated with 「-ません」, and followed by the question particle 「か」. This creates a polite way to ask a question that implies an invitation or suggestion.",
    "writeup": "「ませんか」 is a polite expression used to invite someone to do something or to make a suggestion. It translates to \"Won't you?\" or \"Why don't we?\". It's more direct as an invitation than 「ましょうか」, which is more of a suggestion. To emphasize doing something together, you can add 「一緒に (いっしょに)」, meaning 'together.' Using 「ませんか」 is generally safer and more polite than 「ないか」, especially with people you aren't close to, as 「ないか」 is quite casual and technically less correct in formal settings.",
