    "writeup": "The grammar point 「好きだ・すきだ」 expresses the state of liking something or someone. It's crucial to remember that 「好きだ」 is a **な-adjective**, which affects how it connects to nouns and other grammatical elements.  The basic structure is Subject + は + Object + が + 好きだ/です. The particle 「は」 marks the topic or subject, and 「が」 indicates what the subject likes. Using 「を」 instead of 「が」 is a common mistake. Also, 「大好き」 means \"love.\"",
