    "etymology": "でしょう is derived from です, the polite copula, plus the auxiliary verb う (or よう), which expresses conjecture or intention. Over time, です + う evolved into でしょう.",
    "writeup": "でしょう is a polite expression derived from です, often translated as \"right?\", \"probably\", or \"isn't it?\". It expresses an assertion while seeking the listener's agreement or confirmation. While sounding tentative, でしょう implies the speaker possesses some information supporting their statement. It's generally attached to the plain form of words. In formal settings, you might encounter 〜ますでしょう, but it's less common.",
