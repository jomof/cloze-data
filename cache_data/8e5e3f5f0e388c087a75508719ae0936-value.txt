  "writeup": "お～になる (or ご～になる) is an honorific expression used to show respect towards the actions of the person being addressed or another person—never the speaker.  The verb になる functions similarly to する, but attaches to the masu-stem of the verb. The choice between お and ご depends on the word's origin: お is used with words of native Japanese origin (kun-yomi), while ご is used with words of Chinese origin (on-yomi).  Interestingly, お and ご both derive from the same kanji, 御, with 御 being both a kun-yomi and an on-yomi reading.  This subtle difference highlights the depth of Japanese linguistic history.  Some verbs, like いでる, are almost exclusively used with honorific language.  おいでになる, the お～になる form of いでる, illustrates this, meaning 'to come', 'to go', or 'to be'. This stems from the speaker's perspective when employing honorifics, a topic we will explore further later.",
  "etymology": "The structure combines the honorific prefix お／ご (o/go) with the verb になる (nininaru, 'to become').  The use of になる as a polite auxiliary verb to elevate the meaning of another verb is a grammatical feature highlighting the Japanese emphasis on politeness and social hierarchy.",
