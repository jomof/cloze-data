  "writeup": "The grammar point ということだ, literally translating to \"it is that it is...,\" functions as a way to nominalize a preceding phrase and add a strong assertion.  It conveys a sense of certainty, indicating that the information is considered factual rather than speculative. Think of it as a more confident and assertive version of そうだ (sōda). While often translated as \"I heard that\" or \"it is said that,\" the emphasis rests on the conclusion itself being factual. This construction is versatile and frequently used to emphasize a point, particularly after explanations or reported information.  It's commonly used in standard registers across various contexts.  Note that when using ということだ to convey hearsay, the alternative とのことだ might be slightly more appropriate,  placing a little more weight on the source of the information.  Finally, ということだ is generally considered more formal than そうだ when relating heard information.",

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
