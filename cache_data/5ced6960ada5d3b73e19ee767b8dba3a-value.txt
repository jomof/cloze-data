  "writeup": "The phrase まい～のように, meaning \"almost every,\" \"nearly every,\" or \"on a ~ basis,\" builds upon the familiar のように.  The word まい (from the kanji 毎) signifies \"every,\" always followed by a word expressing a measure, usually time.  While seemingly straightforward, its nuance lies in the subtle difference between \"every\" and \"almost every.\"  The use of よう (from 様), indicating \"manner,\" emphasizes the recurring nature of the action, \"in the manner of every (A).\"  This leaves the listener to interpret the frequency as either strict regularity or near-regularity.  \n\n**Important Considerations:**  Although のように and みたいに are often interchangeable, this is not the case with まい～のように. This is due to the formal origin of みたいだ (from 見たような), making it unsuitable for describing things intangible, like time intervals. ",
