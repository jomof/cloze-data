    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of 「よう」 (you), meaning 'way' or 'manner,' the particle 「に」 (ni), and 「てほしい」 (te hoshii), which expresses the speaker's desire for someone else to do something. The 「よう」 modifies the action described by the verb, indicating the desired manner or state.",
    "writeup": "「ように〜てほしい」 combines 「ようだ」, which means 'like' or 'similar to,' with the 「てほしい」 structure, indicating a desire for someone to do something. 「ようだ」 takes the adverbial form 「ように」 when linked to a verb. This expression highlights that you (or someone else) want someone to do something 'in the way of (A).' When 「ように」 follows a noun, 「の」 is required. Either 「に」 or 「が」 may mark the thing that the speaker 'wants' to do; 「に」 is more common for people, while 「が」 often marks events/objects. Sometimes 「が」 and 「に」 are switched to avoid repetition or confusion.",
