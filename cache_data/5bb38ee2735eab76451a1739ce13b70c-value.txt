  "writeup": "てもかまわない (temo kamawanai) is a versatile expression conveying indifference or acceptance.  It literally translates to \"even if ~, it doesn't matter.\"  This structure combines the て form of a verb or adjective with かまわない, the negative form of 構う (kamawazu) meaning \"to mind\" or \"to care.\"  The nuance is one of nonchalant acceptance; the speaker isn't expressing strong preference either way.  The flexibility of ても (or でも for nouns and na-adjectives) allows it to accommodate various word types.  It's frequently used in everyday conversation across age groups and genders.",
  "etymology": "The word かまわない (kamawanai) is the negative form of the verb 構う (kamauu), meaning 'to mind,' 'to care about,' or 'to bother.'  The kanji 構 (kamaeru) itself implies a posture of resistance or preparation, but in this context, the negation removes the notion of resistance, implying lack of concern.  The ても/でも adds emphasis, signifying that the speaker's lack of concern extends to various scenarios.",

      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "interrogative",

    {
      "japanese": "彼がどんなに遅く来ても、私**はかまわない**。",
      "english": "No matter how late he comes, I don't mind.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The casual register and the use of 「私」 (watashi) instead of 「あたし」 (atashi) adds a more mature and composed nuance, which is not overly assertive. This helps convey a certain level of sophistication while expressing a casual attitude toward the man's lateness. This can be interpreted as a woman subtly hinting that she likes this man's actions, even if he is late."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "高いものでも**かまいません**。あなたと一緒なら、どこへでも行きます。",
      "english": "It doesn't matter if it's expensive; I'll go anywhere with you.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "conjugation": "polite negative",
      "nuance": "The polite register makes the statement sophisticated and romantic. Using 「あなた」 (anata) rather than a more casual form like 「きみ」 (kimi) lends a touch of formality and respect. This shows the respect and openness of the speaker but still has a flirty tone due to the sentence."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the nuance of てもかまわない shifts subtly depending on context.  While generally conveying indifference, it can also imply a willingness to accommodate or even a subtle hint of affection, as seen in some of the examples above.  The choice between かまわない and かまいません depends on the level of formality needed.",

      "meaning": "It's okay to; It's alright to; Can/may",
      "kind": "synonym",

      "meaning": "It is alright/fine/okay even if; Can/may; ~ is also okay",

      "meaning": "If it's okay; If you don't mind; If you would like; If possible",

      "nuance": "でよければ suggests a conditional acceptance based on the listener's preference, while てもかまわない expresses unconditional indifference."

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the subtle difference in emphasis.  てもかまわない emphasizes the speaker's lack of concern, while てもいい grants permission, and でよければ presents a conditional agreement.  Choose the expression that best reflects the speaker's intended nuance."
