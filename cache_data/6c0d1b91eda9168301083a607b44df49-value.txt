  "writeup": "The verb いる (iru) means \"to exist\" or \"to be present,\" specifically for animate beings or living things.  It's a fundamental verb in Japanese, crucial for expressing the presence of people, animals, or anything considered alive.  The polite form is います (imasu).  This grammar point combines いる with the particle が (ga), indicating the subject.  While often omitted in casual conversation,  the が is grammatically important.  Mastering いる is essential for basic Japanese sentence construction.  Remember to use ある (aru) for inanimate objects.",
  "etymology": "The verb いる comes from the verb 居る (iru), meaning \"to dwell\" or \"to reside.\"  This reflects its core meaning of existence in a specific place. The modern usage has expanded somewhat to denote presence simply, but the core of “being located somewhere” remains. ",

      "nuance": "The use of 「いらっしゃいました」is distinctly formal and respectful, suitable for a setting where addressing a superior is necessary.  The 「いらっしゃいました」 would never be used casually and is more frequently used by older speakers."

      "nuance": "This sentence utilizes a plain non-past form to create a light, informal, flirty tone. 「一緒」indicates togetherness and the implied closeness between the two people. A female speaker using this sentence to a male listener would convey romantic interest naturally."

  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the context and register subtly shift the meaning and appropriateness of the same verb.
