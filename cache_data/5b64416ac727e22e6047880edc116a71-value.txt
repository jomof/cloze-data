  "writeup": "The particle が has multiple uses, all revolving around highlighting a specific element.  In this context, we focus on its use to mean 'but' or 'however' in English.  This nuance subtly shifts the emphasis, indicating a contrast or exception to a preceding statement.  It's often used after verb or い-adjective forms; with nouns or な-adjectives, it requires だ/です.  The implication is that while the first part is true, there's additional, often contrasting information. Importantly, this usage of が leans towards formality due to its direct assertion of contrasting information. \n\n**Caution:**  Sentences sometimes end with が, indicating unstated, but obvious, further details. This isn't the 'but' usage; it simply implies an understood continuation.",
  "etymology": "The particle が originates from the ancient form of the word  '我' (ware) meaning 'I' or 'me'. Over time, its usage evolved, losing its pronominal function and developing a variety of grammatical roles. Its use as a contrastive particle, signifying 'but', likely stems from its original function of emphasizing the speaker's perspective or position within the sentence, thereby implying an opposition to a previously stated assertion.  This reflects a grammatical shift from subject marking to emphasizing a contrasting element in the clause structure.",
