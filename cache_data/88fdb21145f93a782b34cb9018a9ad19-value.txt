    "etymology": "The expression 「はさておき」 is composed of 「は」 (the topic particle), 「さて」 (meaning \"well then\" or \"now\"), and 「おき」 which is the conjunctive form of the verb 「置く」 (oku) meaning \"to put\" or \"to place\". Literally, it suggests \"putting (something) aside for now.\"",
    "writeup": "「はさておき」 is an expression often translated as \"leaving aside (A)\" or \"apart from (A).\" It combines the adverbial particle 「は」, the conjunction 「さて」 (\"now,\" to move to a new topic), and the conjunctive form of 「置く」 (\"to place,\" \"to leave\"), which is 「置き」. A more literal translation might be \"now putting aside (A).\" This structure is used when (A) is a topic the speaker wants to move away from to discuss something more important. 「はさておき」 directly follows nouns or phrases ending in 「かどうか」, meaning \"disregarding whether it is (A) or not, (B),\" implying (B) is the more appropriate topic.",
