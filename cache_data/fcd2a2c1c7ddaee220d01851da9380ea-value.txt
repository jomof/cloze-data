  "writeup": "The expression に違いない (ni chigainai) conveys certainty or strong conviction about something.  It literally translates to \"there's no difference\" or \"there's no discrepancy,\" implying that an alternative explanation is highly improbable.  It's formed by combining the particle に (ni), indicating location or state, the noun 違い (chigai, difference), and the i-adjective ない (nai, not).  You'll typically find に違いない attached to the plain form of verbs, i-adjectives, na-adjectives, or nouns.  Think of it as a way to express your confident assertion about a situation.  This construction offers a strong and assertive tone, useful when you're sure of your conclusion.  It's generally suitable for most everyday conversations, although excessive use might sound somewhat forceful.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of に違いない is straightforward.  違い (chigai) means 'difference' or 'discrepancy.'  The ない (nai) negates this, creating 'no difference.' The particle に (ni) specifies the preceding element as the location or state where this 'no difference' applies. Thus, the entire phrase emphasizes the absence of any deviation from the stated fact.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to distinguishing these similar expressions lies in the degree and type of certainty conveyed. に違いない expresses a strong, almost undeniable certainty based on observation or deduction.  The others offer alternative ways to express confidence, but with slightly different nuances and levels of formality."
