    "writeup": "The grammar point 「何〜ない」 indicates that something doesn't exist at all or that something is done without any of a particular quality. It emphasizes a complete absence. It is often used in formal writing and speech to add emphasis. There are three basic patterns:\n\n*   「何 + Noun + ない」: This pattern indicates that there is absolutely no [Noun]. For example, 「何不自由ない生活」 means \"a life without any inconvenience.\"\n*   「何 + Noun + なく + Verb」: This pattern indicates doing something without any [Noun]. For example, 「何不自由なく暮らす」 means \"to live without any inconvenience.\"\n*   「何一つない」: This pattern emphasizes that not even a single instance of something exists.",
    "etymology": "「何」 means \"what\" or \"which,\" but in this construction, it takes on the meaning of \"any\" or \"no.\" 「ない」 means \"there isn't\" or \"does not exist.\" Together, they create an emphatic negation.",
