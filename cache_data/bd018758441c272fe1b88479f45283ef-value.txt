  "writeup": "いかん (ikan) is a formal grammatical structure, often used in written Japanese, particularly in formal documents or announcements. It's essentially an abbreviation of 如何 (いかん), meaning 'in what way' or 'how.'  In most contexts, it translates directly to 'depending on' and is followed by the auxiliary verb だ (da) or its conjunctive form で (de).  いかん follows nouns and may be preceded by の (no).  Sometimes, によって (ni yotte) is added for emphasis, literally translating to 'depending on the way (A) is, (B)'.  いかん functions similarly to 次第 (shidai), 'upon (A)' or 'depending on (A)', often implying the degree of (A) determines the outcome. Therefore, it frequently appears with verbs expressing decision-making, such as 決まる (kimaru, 'to be decided').  Interestingly, いかん, like いかに (ikani), is another word for どう (dou, 'how') and shares the same kanji structure.  Many dictionaries explain いかん using the structure かどうであるによって ('depending on whether or not'), but it's simpler to view it as a less common variant of どう or かどうである.",
  "etymology": "The term いかん (ikan) derives from the classical word 如何 (ikan), meaning 'how' or 'in what way'. Its usage in modern Japanese reflects a formal retention of this classical structure, highlighting its origins in more formal written styles.",
