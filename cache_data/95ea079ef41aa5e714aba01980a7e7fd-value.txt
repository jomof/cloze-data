    "etymology": "たる is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb たり. たり itself is a contraction of the case marking particle と and あり (to be). This can be compared to なり, which is a contraction of に and あり.",
    "writeup": "たる is a structure that indicates something that \"is (A)\" similarly to である, and will often be translated as \"(B) in the position of (A)\" or \"(B) as an (A).\" たる is a combination of たる, which is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb たり, and the case marking particle に. たる will appear after a noun marking some sort of position, with a statement about that position following. It may be used either positively or negatively.\n\ntaru can be combined with 者 (mono). In these cases, (A)たる者 will specifically mean \"a person in the position of (A),\" and generally describes what is appropriate of that position. This use may be translated as \"for\" or \"as.\"\n\nAlthough this structure means \"to be\" similarly to である, the emphasis is far more on qualifications or expectations related to that position. Due to this, たる will not be used when simply stating that \"(B) is (A).\"\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nAlthough たる relates to the suitability of something being in a specific position, be careful not to confuse it with the う-Verb 足る (tariru) \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be worthy.\"",
