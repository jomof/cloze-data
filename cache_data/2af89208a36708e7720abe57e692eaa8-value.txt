    "etymology": "The grammar point 「だす」 is derived from the verb 「出す(だす)」, which means \"to take out\" or \"to produce.\" When used as a suffix attached to the ます-stem of another verb, it carries the nuance of something that was previously latent or held inside now emerging or starting suddenly.",
    "writeup": "「だす」, written as 出す in kanji, is a verb that attaches to the ます-stem (conjunctive form) of other verbs. It conveys the meaning of \"to suddenly do (A)\" or \"to burst into (A).\" To use this construction, simply add 「だす」 to the ます-stem of the verb that you want to emphasize as happening suddenly.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   Unlike 「はじめる」, which also means \"to begin,\" 「だす」 often carries a nuance of being unintentional or something that the subject cannot avoid doing. 「はじめる」, on the other hand, expresses the subject's direct intention to do (A).\n*   It is most commonly used with verbs that describe actions that are spontaneous and difficult to control.",
