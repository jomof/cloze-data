    "etymology": "The term 「しかも」 originally comes from the combination of the archaic interjection 「然 (しか)」, meaning 'as such' or 'like that', and the particle 「も」, meaning 'too' or 'also'. This etymology reflects its function of adding something more to what has already been stated.",
    "writeup": "「しかも」 is a conjunction in Japanese which commonly translates to \"furthermore\" or \"moreover.\" It's a somewhat formal grammar pattern indicating that both A and B exist in unison. 「しかも」 itself focuses on the overall topic, used for objective opinions like observable facts rather than personal opinions.\n\nAs a conjunction, 「しかも」 is used between two phrases or at the beginning of a second sentence, referring back to the first. A is often considered the 'base' information, with B adding extra information or further explaining A.\n\nIn modern writing, 「しかも」 may appear as 「而も」 or 「併も」, though both are quite rare.",
