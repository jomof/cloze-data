    "etymology": "The etymology of 「まだ」 is somewhat uncertain, but it's believed to have originated from the verb 「待つ (まつ)」, meaning \"to wait.\" The idea is that something is still in a state of waiting or continuing.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「まだ」 translates to \"still\" or \"not yet\" depending on the context. It indicates something is unexpectedly continuing. In affirmative sentences, 「まだ」 means \"still,\" showing something is in the same state as before. In negative sentences, it typically means \"not yet,\" indicating something hasn't happened. 「まだ」 can also be used in questions to confirm if something is ongoing. Repeating it as 「まだまだ」 emphasizes something is lacking or insufficient.",
