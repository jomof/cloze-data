    "writeup": "「あれ」 is used to refer to something that is distant from both the speaker and the listener.  Think of it as the English equivalent of \"that over there.\"  It's one of the basic demonstrative pronouns, along with 「これ」 (this) and 「それ」 (that - near the listener).  It's important to remember the distance aspect; if something is closer to the listener, you'd typically use 「それ」, and if it's close to you, you'd use 「これ」.  Be careful not to confuse 「あれ」 with the interjection 「あれ？」 which means \"huh?\" or \"oh?\". The meaning is usually clear from the context and intonation.",
