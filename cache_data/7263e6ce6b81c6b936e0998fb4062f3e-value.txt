  "etymology": "によると combines 「に」 (the particle indicating direction or location), 「よる」 (the verb 'to depend on, to be based on', 依る, 拠る, 因る, 由る), and 「と」 (the particle indicating a quote or condition). によれば uses the conditional form 「～ば」 of 「よる」.",
  "writeup": "「によると」 and 「によれば」 are used to indicate the source of information. They translate to \"according to\" or \"based on.\" The source (A) precedes 「によると」 or 「によれば」, and the information derived from that source (B) follows. (A) is the source of information which will be conveyed in the (B) part of the sentence. This expression is used after nouns. Newspapers and articles often use the more formal 「によりますと」.\n\nWhile largely interchangeable, 「によると」 implies a higher degree of certainty or reliability compared to 「によれば」. Therefore, 「によると」 is often used for legitimate sources like the police or news.\n\n「よる」 is usually written in hiragana, but can be written with kanji, each with slightly different nuances:\n\n*   依る (yoru): (B) depends on (A)\n*   拠る (yoru): (B) extends from (A)\n*   因る (yoru): (B) results from (A)\n*   由る (yoru): (B) is due to (A)",
