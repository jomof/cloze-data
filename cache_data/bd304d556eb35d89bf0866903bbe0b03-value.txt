    "etymology": "The etymology of 「さも」 is somewhat debated, but it is believed to be related to the adverb 「然 (さ) 」 meaning \"so\" or \"thus,\" combined with 「も」, an emphatic particle. Over time, 「さも」 evolved to express a strong appearance or manner, often implying a discrepancy between appearance and reality.",
    "writeup": "「さも」 is an adverb used to describe how someone's action or behavior appears, often implying that their behavior is exaggerated or not entirely genuine. It conveys the sense of “truly,” “really,” or “as if.” It's often used to describe someone behaving in a way that seems pretentious or affected. The nuance is usually that the speaker believes the person's behavior is not entirely genuine.",
