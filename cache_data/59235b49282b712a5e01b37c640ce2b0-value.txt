  "writeup": "The classical adverbial particle なり, when used in lists, expresses that each item is a possibility, requiring a choice.  This use of なり indicates that either (A) or (B) is acceptable, and other similar options might also be suitable. It's non-exhaustive. なり is a polite construction following dictionary-form verbs or nouns, sometimes with added particles providing crucial information for the 'choice,' such as に for location.  Like all adverbial particles, なり cannot follow が or を.  This emphasis on choosing from the list (A)なり(B)なり distinguishes it from similar structures like など and や.  なり doesn't mean 'such as,' only 'either, or'.",
  "etymology": "The particle なり originates from the verb なり (to become). In this grammatical construction, it retains a sense of becoming or being one of the listed options.",
