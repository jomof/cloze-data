    "etymology": "The adjective 「ほしい」 is believed to be derived from the verb 「欲す (ほっす)」, meaning \"to desire.\" Over time, 「欲す」 became less common, and 「ほしい」 evolved into the primary way to express wanting something. Keep in mind that 「ほしい」 is used to describe *your own* desires. To describe someone else's desires, you'll typically use 「欲しがる (ほしがる)」.",
    "writeup": "「ほしい」 is an *i-adjective* used to express **desire** or wanting something. The person wanting something is marked with 「は」, and the thing they want is marked with 「が」. Remember, 「ほしい」 is generally used to talk about **your own** desires. When talking about what someone else wants, use 「欲しがる」. Using 「ほしい」 for others can sound childish or presumptuous.",
