        "Usage": "Indicates the specific time when an action or event takes place. It is used with specific times, dates, days of the week, and certain events.",
        "Exclusions": "Cannot be used with time expressions like 「今朝」 (this morning), 「明日」 (tomorrow), 「昨日」 (yesterday), 「今日」 (today), 「最近」 (recently), etc., because these are not specific points in time. Also, does not work with relative references like 「今週」 (this week), 「来月」 (next month), etc."

    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 has ancient roots in Japanese, evolving from earlier forms used to denote location and direction. Over time, its function expanded to include marking specific points in time. It's a fundamental particle and its origins are intertwined with the core development of the Japanese language.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 is used to indicate a specific point in time when something happens. Think of it as answering the question \"When?\" It's crucial for specifying *when* an event occurs, whether it's a time, date, or day of the week. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   Use 「に」 with specific times like 「6時に」 (at 6 o'clock), dates like 「4月1日に」 (on April 1st), and days of the week like 「月曜日に」 (on Monday).\n*   Don't use 「に」 with general time expressions like 「明日」 (tomorrow) or 「今週」 (this week). These aren't specific enough.",
