        "Register": "Varies depending on politeness level (だ vs. です)",
        "Function": "Expressing distance in terms of travel time",

    },
    "etymology": "「ところ」 (tokoro) literally means \"place\" or \"location.\" The grammar point uses this basic meaning to describe a location not by its coordinates, but by how long it takes to get there. It's a practical way of expressing distance in terms of time and transportation method.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point indicates that a location is a certain distance away, measured by the time it takes to reach it. It's equivalent to saying \"it takes ~ to get to\" in English. The structure is often used with a means of transportation (e.g., walking, bus, car) and a duration of time. 「ところだ」 is often interchangeable with 「ところにある」, though the former is more concise. Remember to adjust the level of politeness with 「です」 when appropriate.",
