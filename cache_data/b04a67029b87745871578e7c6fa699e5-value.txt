  "writeup": "である (de aru) and its polite form であります (de arimasu) function as formal or literary equivalents of だ (da) and です (desu).  Unlike です, which indicates politeness, である emphasizes formality and authority.  It's frequently used in written Japanese, legal documents, official pronouncements, and certain professional contexts like news reports or scholarly articles.  While grammatically correct in many situations where だ or です would appear, its usage dramatically alters the tone.  In casual conversation, it would sound overly stiff or even archaic.  The polite form, であります, is even more formal and restricted, predominantly used in highly formal settings such as military or political speeches, adding a layer of deference or respect, usually towards a superior. Note that である can also be used to connect nouns in a manner similar to な (na) adjectives, though this application feels unnatural in modern speech.  Consider it a powerful tool for formal writing, but use caution in spoken language.",

      "japanese": "これは、私の新しい自転車**である**。",
      "english": "This is my new bicycle.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses \"これは\" (kore wa), a neutral phrase suitable for both genders and ages.  The formal register of \"である\" (de aru) makes the statement sound more authoritative, as if the speaker is declaring a fact rather than making a casual observation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼は、優秀な医者**であった**。",
      "english": "He was an excellent doctor.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "storytelling",
      "conjugation": "past tense (plain)",
      "nuance": "The past tense \"であった\" (de atta) maintains the formality but adds a sense of remembrance or reflection. \"彼は\" (kare wa) is a standard pronoun for 'he' appropriate for most situations. The formality reflects a respectful tone in recounting the past."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この計画は、成功する**であろう**。",
      "english": "This plan will be a success.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "optimistic",
      "conjugation": "future tense (plain)",
      "nuance": "The sentence is more assertive and less tentative compared to a casual expression of future plans. The formality implies a higher degree of certainty. Using \"この計画\" (kono keikaku) and \"成功する\"(seikō suru) avoids any gendered language. This is suitable for both formal and less formal speech."

    {
      "japanese": "あなたの美しさは、言葉では言い表せないほど**である**。",
      "english": "Your beauty is beyond words.",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "While the compliment itself is romantic, the use of \"である\"(de aru) gives it a certain gravitas, as if the speaker is certain of this sentiment.  The choice of \"あなたの美しさ\" (anata no utsukushisa) to refer to 'your beauty' is formal and suitable for the register."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "会議の結論は、文書で正式に発表される**ものである**。",
      "english": "The conclusions of the meeting will be formally announced in writing.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The construction shows the inherent formality of the topic and the speaker's authority.  The use of \"会議の結論\" (kaigi no ketsuron) is suitably formal and avoids any gender-specific terms."

    {
      "japanese": "私が、このプロジェクトのリーダー**であります**。",
      "english": "I am the leader of this project.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": "polite form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of \"であります\" (de arimasu) adds a layer of politeness and formality which fits professional settings.  The use of \"私\"(watashi) is a self-referential pronoun that is commonly used, but still formal and can be used by both genders."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "君と出会えたことは、私の人生における奇跡**であった**。",
      "english": "Meeting you was a miracle in my life.",

      "conjugation": "past tense (plain)",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of \"君\" (kimi) shows a degree of intimacy, which is somewhat offset by the formal past tense \"であった\" (de atta), making the statement sound more profound and sincere."

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the appropriate usage of である depends heavily on context. While it adds formality and authority, overuse can sound unnatural or pretentious.  Mastering its nuances requires a keen sensitivity to the Japanese language and its various registers.",

      "term": "がある",
      "meaning": "To exist; there is/are",

      "meaning": "To be (in a position of); as a; for",

      "nuance": "たる implies a role or function, whereas である simply indicates being.  たる suggests a specific capacity or status; である is more general."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to distinguishing these expressions is understanding the nuance of formality and the specific meaning conveyed.  Each serves a distinct purpose and using them interchangeably will lead to inappropriate or unnatural sounding Japanese. Consider the context—casual conversation calls for だ or です, whereas formal situations or writing necessitate である.  たる has a more specialized use, highlighting roles or functions."
