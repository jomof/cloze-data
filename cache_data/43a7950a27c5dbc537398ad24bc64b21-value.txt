    "writeup": "The expression 「んだけど」 combines 「んだ」 (which explains something or gives a reason) with 「けど」 (meaning \"but\"). Together, they generally translate to \"but...\", although the nuance is closer to \"but with (A) as the reason… (B)\", where (B) is sometimes left unsaid. This implies the speaker is looking for a reply or doesn't want to say the (B) part of the sentence out of politeness or awkwardness.\n\nThere are several forms of this construction, which are mostly interchangeable, ranging from casual to formal:\n\n*   「んだけど」\n*   「んだけれど」\n*   「んだけれども」\n*   「んだが」\n*   「んですが」\n\nThe 「ん」 can be replaced with 「の」 in any of the above, making it slightly more formal.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   「んだが」, or simply 「だが」, is considered quite masculine. If you use this form, soften your tone to avoid sounding too authoritative.\n*   The 「ん」 (or 「の」) may sometimes be omitted completely, but this is less common in modern Japanese.",
    "etymology": "The 「ん」 in 「んだけど」 and 「んですが」 is a shortened form of 「の」, which functions as a nominalizer (turning a verb phrase into a noun phrase) and provides a softer, explanatory tone. 「けど」 and 「が」 are conjunctions meaning \"but.\"",
