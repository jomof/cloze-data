    "etymology": "ながらも is derived from the particle ながら (meaning \"while\") and the particle も (meaning \"also, even\"). This combination creates a nuance of contrast or concession, expressing that something is true *even though* something else is also true. The kanji 乍ら indicates \"while\" and further emphasizes the concurrent nature of the two connected ideas.",
    "writeup": "**ながらも** combines the conjunction particle **ながら** and the adverbial particle **も**. Derived from the kanji 乍ら, which carries the meaning \"while,\" **ながらも** typically retains this nuance. Therefore, it can be translated as \"even while (A), (B)\" or \"although (A), also (B).\" **ながらも** often expresses surprise at the coexistence of (A) and (B), and it can follow い-adjectives, な-adjectives, nouns, or the conjunctive form of verbs. It highlights a thing that comes after the existing state of (A). Because of this, **ながらも** is suitable for verbs describing states of existence (such as feelings) rather than ongoing actions.",
