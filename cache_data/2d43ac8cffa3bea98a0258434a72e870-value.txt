    "etymology": "The particle と likely evolved from the verb 'to say' (言う), originally indicating a quote or condition, which then broadened to include the meaning of 'and' by linking related items or ideas.",
    "writeup": "と is a particle often translated as \"and\" in English. In a broader sense, と shows a relationship of 'compilation' between (A) and (B). This relationship could be items existing together (translated as \"and\") or performing an action together (translated as \"with\"). We're focusing on the \"and\" meaning here. (The \"with\" meaning is discussed elsewhere.)\n\nと is required after each noun it groups with. However, the final と in a sentence is often omitted, especially in conversation, though including it is technically more correct. For example, 「りんごとみかんとバナナ」 (apple, orange, and banana) can become 「りんごとみかんとバナナ」, with the last と dropped.",
