  "writeup": "The grammar point としては extends the meaning of として, 'as,' by adding the は particle.  This は emphasizes the subject (A) as a distinct entity before a comparison or assessment (B) is made from the perspective of (A).  Think of it as 'considering (A) as (A), (B)'.  It's often translated as 'as (A)' or 'for an (A),' frequently highlighting a person or organization as the viewpoint for making an assumption.  としては follows nouns.  Its structure combines と, the て-form of する, and は. When the noun isn't a person or organization, the translation leans towards 'as for,' simply highlighting the topic (A) before the speaker's opinion on that topic follows. Unlike にしては, which offers more personal opinions, としては makes broader judgments based on general expectations and aspects of (A).",
  "etymology": "としては is a combination of と (as, like), the て-form of する (to do), and は (topic marker).  The て-form of する connects the noun to the following clause, showing a conditional or background relationship. The は emphasizes the noun's role as a point of reference.",

    {
      "japanese": "彼は**先輩としては**優秀だが、友達としては少し難しい。",
      "english": "He's excellent as a senpai, but a bit difficult as a friend.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「優秀だが」 which shows a nuanced view, balancing positive and negative qualities.  This is typical of a semi-formal register and a reflective setting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この計画は**アイデアとしては**斬新だが、実現可能性は低い。",
      "english": "This plan is innovative as an idea, but its feasibility is low.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence's objectivity and use of formal vocabulary like 「実現可能性」 are indicative of a professional setting and semi-formal register. The choice of 「斬新だが」 presents a considered opinion rather than a purely positive or negative assessment."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼女を**恋人としては**どう思う？",
      "english": "What do you think of her as a lover?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The casual register and flirty setting are evident.  The direct question, 「恋人としてはどう思う？」 is a common way to start a conversation on a romantic level."

    {
      "japanese": "私を**友達としては**どう思う？",
      "english": "How do you feel about me as a friend?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「私を」 and the casual 「どう思う？」 create an intimate yet inquiring tone, appropriate for a first date. The speaker tests the waters gently without being too forward."

    {
      "japanese": "彼の作品は**芸術家としては**素晴らしいが、商業的には成功していない。",
      "english": "His work is wonderful as an artist's, but it hasn't been a commercial success.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "academic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal tone is established through the use of 「素晴らしいが」 and the more formal phrasing of the latter half of the sentence. The choice of 「芸術家としては」 and 「商業的には」 helps to structure the critique in an academic, objective manner."

      "meaning": "To, For, Concerning",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "に取って emphasizes the perspective or point of view of the noun, but less about the comparative judgment which is central to としては. It is more about a perspective, rather than an evaluation based on the perspective."

    {
      "term": "たる",
      "meaning": "To be (in a position of), As a, For",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "たる suggests inherent qualities or roles, whereas としては presents a judgment or comparison based on those qualities or roles in a given context.  たる is more static; としては is more dynamic."

  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The subtle differences between these similar expressions hinge on the focus:  comprehensive evaluation (としては), surprising aspects (としては), purpose/reference (には), perspective (に取って), and inherent qualities (たる).  Choosing the right one depends on whether you are making a comparative judgement, highlighting a surprising quality, stating a purpose, describing a perspective, or stating an inherent quality."
