  "writeup": "The verb 切る (kiru), meaning \"to cut,\" takes on a fascinating nuance when used after the conjunctive form of other verbs.  It doesn't simply mean \"to cut\" in these contexts; instead, it implies completing an action thoroughly, often due to the exhaustion of resources or effort. This leads to several possible translations such as 'to do (A) to the point of being unable to continue,' 'to totally and utterly do (A),' or 'to resolutely do (A)'.  The emphasis is on the completeness and finality of the action.  The use of 切る often suggests that one has pushed through to the very end, perhaps even beyond initial expectations.",
  "etymology": "切る (kiru) itself comes from the ancient concept of using a blade to sever something.  This primal image of decisive separation underpins its extended meaning of completing an action decisively.  The usage after a conjunctive verb extends this idea from physical cutting to the completion of any kind of task.",
