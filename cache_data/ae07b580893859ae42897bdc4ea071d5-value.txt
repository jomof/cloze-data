    "writeup": "際 is a noun in Japanese that means \"verge\". This is as in \"to be on the verge\", and translates mostly as \"on the occasion of (A)\", \"at the time of (A)\", \"in case of (A)\", or \"when (A)\". In the same way as \"verge\" in English, it implies a fairly big or somehow important event, and will not be used with standard occurrences. 際に will appear after verbs in either their dictionary or past-tense forms, and after nouns. In the case of nouns, it will be preceded by の. While (A) is likely to be a temporary or one-off event, 際に is not limited to one-off situations. It may also appear with regularly occurring events, but the way of reacting to that event may change depending on some one-off circumstances.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Although 際に and 時に may overlap in certain situations, 際に will sound unnatural when the situation involves something that typically does not change, or always happens the same way.",
