    "etymology": "「後(あと)」 literally means 'behind' or 'after.' When used with 「の」 and a noun, it indicates what comes sequentially or remains after a certain point or quantity.",
    "writeup": "One common use of the noun 「後(あと)」, meaning \"behind,\" is to express a remainder or what comes after a certain point. This can be translated as \"what's left of (A),\" \"the rest of (A),\" \"what's remaining of (A),\" or even \"other than (A).\" 「後」 is typically grouped with the case-marking particle 「の」 before nouns or used directly before numbers. Despite the variety of translations, the core meaning of 「後」 remains identifying a sequence and indicating what follows a specific point in that sequence.",
