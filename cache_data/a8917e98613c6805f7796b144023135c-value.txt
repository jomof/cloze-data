  "writeup": "へ (e) is a particle indicating direction or movement towards a location.  While often interchangeable with に (ni), へ emphasizes the journey or effort involved in reaching the destination, adding a sense of movement and distance. に, conversely, focuses more on the arrival or the state of being at the destination.  へ always follows the noun indicating the destination.  Consider the subtle difference:  Going 'to' a place (に) versus going 'toward' a place (へ).  The latter implies a sense of progress or travel. This nuance is crucial for conveying politeness, as in 'ようこそ (yōkoso)' greetings, which imply appreciation for the journey undertaken by the visitor.  This particle is fundamental and used in everyday conversations.",
  "etymology": "The particle へ is believed to have evolved from the ancient word へ (e) meaning 'towards,' 'to' or 'in the direction of'. Its usage has remained consistent across different periods of the Japanese language, although its subtle distinctions from に have become more refined over time.",
