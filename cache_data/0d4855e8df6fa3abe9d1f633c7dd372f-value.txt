  "writeup": "This grammar point, 言うまでもない ②, differs slightly from its counterpart, は言うまでもない ①.  While both convey the meaning of \"it goes without saying,\"  言うまでもない ② typically appears at the *beginning* of a sentence, whereas は言うまでもない ① usually follows a preceding phrase.  The structure combines the verb 言う (to say), the particles まで (even) and も (also), and the negative adjective ない (not).  It's essentially a concise way to express that something is self-evident.  The phrase is often followed by expressions like ことだが, が, or けど, adding a nuance of \"but\" or a slight contrast, making it perfect to introduce a point that’s obvious yet requires further explanation.  This structure provides a polite way to state the obvious without sounding condescending.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's construction is quite straightforward.  言う (yu-u) 'to say' combines with まで (made) 'even,' も (mo) 'also,' and ない (nai) 'not' to form a powerful expression emphasizing the self-evident nature of a following statement. The use of まで and も  together intensifies the sense of comprehensiveness and obviousness.",
