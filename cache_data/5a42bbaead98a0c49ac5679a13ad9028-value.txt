    "etymology": "それに is derived from それ (that) + に (to/in). Literally, it means \"to that\" or \"in addition to that,\" referring back to the previous statement.",
    "writeup": "それに is a conjunction used to add information to a previous statement. Think of it as \"and to that,\" where \"that\" refers to the preceding clause. It's often translated as \"moreover,\" \"in addition,\" or simply \"and.\" It is **important** that the information introduced by それに has a logical connection to the first statement, typically sharing the same positive or negative connotation. Mixing positive and negative aspects can sound unnatural.",
