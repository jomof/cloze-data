    "etymology": "The grammar point 「恐れがある」 combines the noun 「恐れ」 (osore), meaning 'fear' or 'risk,' with the verb 「ある」 (aru), meaning 'to exist' or 'to be.' Therefore, it literally means 'fear exists,' conveying the sense that there is a possibility of something undesirable happening.",
    "writeup": "「恐れがある」 is a set phrase used in a fairly literal sense to convey that there is a chance of something negative occurring. It is a combination of the noun 「恐れ」, meaning \"fear\", with 「が」, and the verb 「ある」, meaning \"to be\". It's used when there's a possibility of a negative outcome in a situation, often to warn about caution. 「恐れがある」 is typically used after verbs in dictionary form or nouns followed by 「の」. The nuance often implies an inherent concern. Other common combinations include 「恐れを抱く」 (to harbor a fear) and 「恐れが強まる」 (for fear to intensify).",
