        "とうとう": "Indicates that something finally happens or arrives, often after a long time or effort."
    },
    "etymology": "とうとう comes from the kanji 到頭 (とうとう), where 到 (とう) means \"to arrive at\" and 頭 (とう) means \"the head of/crux of\" something. It carries the nuance of reaching the end or culmination of a process.",
    "writeup": "とうとう is an adverb used to express that something *finally* happens. There are a few ways to express this in Japanese, but とうとう is common. It means that something has \"ended\" or reached its conclusion, usually after a long journey or significant effort.\n\n*   It can describe positive or negative outcomes, focusing on the time and effort involved rather than the result's quality.\n*   However, it is **not** used for events that happen naturally without effort, such as the changing of seasons. In those cases, いよいよ would be more appropriate, suggesting something is \"finally\" starting or happening.",
