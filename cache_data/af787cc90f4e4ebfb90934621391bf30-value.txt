    "etymology": "The grammar point 「だけでなく(て)〜も」 is composed of 「だけ」 (dake), meaning \"only\", 「でなく(て)」 (de naku(te)), which is the negative form of 「だ」 (da) in the conjunctive form, and 「も」 (mo), meaning \"also\". Thus, it literally translates to \"not only\" and the addition of 「も」 emphasizes the \"also\" part.",
    "writeup": "「だけでなく(て)〜も」 means \"not only A but also B.\" It emphasizes that both A and B are true or applicable. 「だけでなく」 means \"not only,\" and the addition of 「も」 adds emphasis to the \"also\" part. The 「て」 is optional but makes the sentence flow more naturally. 「なく」 is more formal/written, while 「なくて」 is more casual/colloquial. You can also use 「じゃなく(て)」 instead of 「でなく(て)」.",
