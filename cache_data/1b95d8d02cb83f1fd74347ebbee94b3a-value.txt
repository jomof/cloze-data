  "writeup": "The grammar structure ずじまい combines the literary negative auxiliary verb ず  'not' and the -て form of the verb しまう 'to finish, to end up doing'.  This structure expresses regret or disappointment that something didn't happen, often implying a prior intention or expectation.  It's frequently used in the past tense.  Common translations include \"ended up not doing,\" \"didn't end up doing,\" or \"never got around to doing.\"  The regret stems from the fact that the action *didn't* happen, unlike しまう, which implies regret about *having done* something.  ずじまい often appears with だった or でした, emphasizing the finality of the uncompleted action.  Important Consideration:  The verb before ずじまい is in its -ずに (negative conjunctive) form.  Remember that する becomes せずに in this structure.",
  "etymology": "ずじまい comes from the combination of the classical negative auxiliary verb ず (from ぬ) and the conjunctive form of the verb しまう (じまい), meaning 'to finish' or 'to complete'. The ず provides the negation, indicating that something was not completed, while じまい emphasizes the finality of that incompletion.  The combination evokes a sense of regret or disappointment associated with this unfulfilled action.",
