    "writeup": "い is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese that adds a sense of familiarity and friendliness to the statement or question. It's often seen in compound structures with other particles or auxiliary verbs. Typically, 「い」 is used by men when speaking to someone of a lower social position, often due to age. Therefore, it's common to hear an elderly person use 「い」 when speaking to a younger person.\n\nThis feeling of familiarity is best conveyed when 「い」 is paired with the sentence-ending particle 「か」 or the auxiliary verb 「だ」. 「い」 may also be paired with more emphatic sentence-ending particles such as 「わ」, 「や」, and 「ぞ」, or the auxiliary verb 「た」, though these combinations are less common.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Despite 「い」 primarily being used by men, it's not a strict rule, and women do occasionally use it, especially when partnered with 「か」, 「だ」, or 「わ」.\n*   Although uncommon, 「い」 can be used with the imperative form of verbs to create a slightly less strict-sounding order or command. This usage is rare but may appear in literature.",
    "etymology": "「い」's etymology is somewhat debated, but it's thought to be a contraction of older sentence-ending particles conveying emphasis or inquiry. Its current usage evolved to express a familiar, often slightly condescending, tone.",
