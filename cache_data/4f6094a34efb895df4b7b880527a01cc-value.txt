    "writeup": "「どこ」 is used to ask about a location. It is similar to the 「どれ」 family of words. Just as 「どれ」 means \"which,\" 「どこ」 means \"which place\" or simply \"where.\"\n\nImportant Consideration:\nDon't confuse 「どこ」 with 「どっち」. While both can translate to \"where,\" 「どっち」 focuses more on the *direction* someone or something is moving, while 「どこ」 focuses on the specific *location* itself.",
