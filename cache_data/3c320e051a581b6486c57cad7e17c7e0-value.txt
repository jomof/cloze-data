It conveys the nuance of \"nothing but\" or \"only.\"\n\n*   When used after the *te*-form of a verb (てばかり), it indicates that someone does nothing but that action. It's often followed by いる but doesn't have to be.\n*   When used after the past informal form of a verb (ばかりだ), it means that something has just happened. \n*   When used after a noun (ばかりだ), it indicates that nothing but that noun exists. \n\nWhile ばかり can be written in kanji as 許り, it's rarely seen that way.
