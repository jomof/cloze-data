    "etymology": "The word 「又」 (mata) originally means 'again' or 'also'. When used with 「も」 (mo), it emphasizes that the following information is additional to what has already been stated. The combination 「又〜も」 functions as an adverbial phrase to introduce supplementary details or points.",
    "writeup": "「又〜も」 (mata ~ mo) combines the adverb 「又」 (mata), a noun, and the adverbial particle 「も」 (mo). It translates to \"moreover,\" \"additionally,\" or \"furthermore.\" Since 「も」 (mo) is used, the information in the second part (B) typically introduces new details. To use 「又〜も」, you state a first phrase (A), then use 「又」 (mata) to begin the second phrase (B), followed by a noun + 「も」 (mo). For added emphasis, 「でも」 (demo) or 「ても」 (temo) can replace 「も」 (mo).  For example, 「又、古くても買い取ります」 ('Moreover, we will buy it even if it's old').\n\nConsider the relationship between the kanji 「又」 and 「叉」. 「又」 indicates elements that diverge but then converge or relate back, while 「叉」 suggests a distinct splitting, like a fork in a road.",
