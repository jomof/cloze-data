  "writeup": "だけしか (dakeshika) is a powerful expression combining the adverbial particles だけ (dake) 'only' and しか (shika) 'nothing but'.  It's used to emphatically convey the limited nature of something.  While seemingly redundant—using 'only' twice—each particle contributes a distinct nuance.  だけ (dake) isolates a single item from a group, presenting it as the sole fitting option, while しか (shika) emphasizes the lack of alternatives. Thus, だけしか (dakeshika) asserts 'this one and only this one!', making the limitation exceptionally clear.  It primarily follows nouns and is almost exclusively paired with negative verbs (～ない, -nai). Note that the order of particles is fixed; reversing them wouldn't be grammatically correct or convey the same meaning.  This grammatical structure is standard across most registers and is commonly used across various age groups and regions.   This is quite a precise way of stating that something is the only thing possible.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of だけしか lies in the individual particles.  だけ (dake) originates from the adjective たけき (takeki), meaning 'alone' or 'only', evolving over time to its current adverbial form. しか (shika) derives from the verb しかる (shikaru), meaning 'to be limited' or 'to be restricted', which eventually manifested as an adverbial particle indicating restriction or limitation.",

    {
      "japanese": "週末**だけしか**時間がないから、週末に会いましょう。",
      "english": "I only have time on weekends, so let's meet then.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence employs 「会いましょう」(aimashou), a polite suggestion, appropriate for a first-date scenario. The casualness is reduced by the use of 「週末だけしか」(shuumatsu dakeshika), creating a more suggestive tone."

      "japanese": "お金は500円**だけしか**ありませんでした。",

      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The intimate register is set by the use of 「あのね」(anone), a filler often used in close relationships, and 「考えてないの」(kangaetenaino), a casual female speech pattern that adds a flirty tone.  The phrase 「あなたのことだけしか」(anata no koto dakeshika) itself emphasizes the exclusivity of the speaker's affection."

    }

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the negative verb is crucial for the natural and complete meaning of だけしか. While other verb forms *could* theoretically be used, they are extremely uncommon and would change the overall meaning and feeling of the sentence.",

      "term": "だけ",
      "meaning": "Only, Just",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike だけしか, which emphasizes the exclusive and limiting nature of something, だけ (dake) simply indicates a limited quantity without the strong implication of a lack of alternatives."

      "term": "ばかり",
      "meaning": "Just, Only, Nothing but",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While ばかり (bakari) also indicates 'only' or 'nothing but', it often carries a nuance of 'almost exclusively' or 'mostly', whereas だけしか (dakeshika) is more absolute and definitive."

      "term": "しか～ない",
      "meaning": "There's only, Nothing but",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "しか～ない (shika nai) is structurally similar, but it emphasizes the lack of alternatives and emphasizes the negative aspect more clearly than だけしか (dakeshika), which has a more absolute feeling."

      "term": "きり",
      "meaning": "Only, Just, Since",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "きり (kiri) functions similarly to だけしか (dakeshika) but is generally more concise and commonly used in descriptive contexts. It less frequently implies a negative connotation."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, carefully consider the nuance you wish to express.  If you need to convey a strong, definitive 'only' with a negative implication, だけしか (dakeshika) is ideal. If the focus is simply on the limited quantity, だけ (dake) suffices.  If an 'almost exclusively' sense is desired, choose ばかり (bakari).  For a slightly more emphatic negative restriction, しか～ない (shika nai) may be preferred. Finally, きり (kiri) provides a more concise and less negatively focused alternative."
