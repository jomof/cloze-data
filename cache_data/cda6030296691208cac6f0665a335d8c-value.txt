    "etymology": "たい originates from the verb 'た(つ)' (to complete, to finish, to achieve). Over time, it evolved to express a sense of wanting to complete or achieve an action, hence its current meaning of 'want to do.'",
    "writeup": "たい is an auxiliary adjective that expresses a desire to do something. It attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. For example, 食べます (tabemasu, to eat) becomes 食べたい (tabetai, want to eat). When using たい, the object of desire can be marked with either を or が. が implies a stronger desire. たい conjugates like an い-adjective, so you can use forms such as たくない (takunai, don't want to), たかった (takatta, wanted to), and たくなかった (takunakatta, didn't want to). たい is primarily used to express what *you* want or to ask about what *others* want. It is not used to guess what others might want unless you're directly asking them. Also, it is generally not used to tell someone *you* want *them* to do something; use 〜てほしい for that. Finally, 〜ませんか is more natural when inviting someone to do something.",
