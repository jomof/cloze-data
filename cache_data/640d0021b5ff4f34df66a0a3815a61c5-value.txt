    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「に」, the particle indicating direction or purpose, with 「難い」, a formal and somewhat archaic version of 「難しい」 (difficult). 「難い」 itself is the 連用形 (ren'yōkei or continuative form) of the adjective 「難い」 plus the auxiliary adjective 「ない」. Thus, the phrase literally means \"not difficult to (verb)\", implying ease of imagining, understanding, or predicting.",
    "writeup": "「に難くない」 is a formal grammar pattern indicating that something is \"not difficult to\" imagine, guess, or understand. It uses the adjective 「難い」, a more formal equivalent of 「難しい」 (difficult). This structure appears primarily with verbs indicating thought or conjecture, such as 「想像」 (to imagine), 「予想」 (to predict), 「察する」 (to infer), 「理解」 (to understand), and 「推測」 (to guess). It is primarily used in formal writing and speech.",
