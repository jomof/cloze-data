  "writeup": "The suffix 上, attached to nouns, indicates a perspective or standpoint.  It signifies that what follows is being considered 'from the standpoint of (A)'.  This standpoint (A) usually refers to a specific field or area:  law, rules, budget, etc.  The (B) part of the sentence describes the matter viewed from that standpoint.  上 is quite formal, conveying a similar nuance to に関して \"in connection to,\" implying that (B) is discussed in relation to (A).  It's frequently used with nouns denoting broad areas like '仕事' (work), '教育' (education), '歴史' (history), '健康' (health), '経験' (experience), or '法律' (law).  **Important Consideration:** 上 cannot express an individual's personal viewpoint; it's unsuitable for use with names of people or organizations representing a subjective perspective.",
  "etymology": "The character 上 itself means \"above\" or \"upper\". In this grammatical context, it's not a literal spatial position but rather an abstract position of perspective, looking down from a higher vantage point (the standpoint).  The use of 上 to represent a standpoint likely evolved from the idea of considering something from a superior or authoritative position, mirroring the spatial connotation of the character.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "法律上、伊勢海老を許可なく釣り上げて持って帰ることが禁止されている。",
      "english": "From a legal standpoint, it is prohibited to fish for lobsters and bring them home without a permit.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses formal language, appropriate for conveying legal information.  The structure, 『法律上…禁止されている』, is objective and impersonal, fitting the formal and informative setting."

    {
      "japanese": "規則上、生徒は髪を染めてはいけないのに、髪を染めている生徒が複数います。",
      "english": "From the standpoint of the rules, students shouldn't dye their hair, yet several students have dyed hair.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses slightly less formal language than the first example. The phrase 『規則上』 indicates a more general rule, not explicitly a legal one. The contrast between 『はいけないのに』 and 『います』 shows a discrepancy between rules and reality."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "予算上、その依頼は断るしかない。",
      "english": "From a budgetary standpoint, I have no choice but to refuse the request.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 『予算上』 is suitable in a professional context where financial considerations are paramount.  The phrase 『断るしかない』 emphasizes the lack of alternatives, reflecting a constrained situation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "立場上、ああいう発言をしたが、個人的な意見としては全く反対だ。",
      "english": "From my position, I made such a statement, but personally, I completely disagree.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "While 『立場上』 suggests an official or public position, 『個人的な意見としては』 introduces a counterpoint, revealing the speaker's true feelings.  This creates a more complex and nuanced perspective."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Note the consistent use of 上 with nouns representing a field of consideration rather than a person's viewpoint.  This ensures that the sentence maintains the appropriate formal tone and objective perspective. The choice of verb conjugation often depends on the nuance you want to convey and the overall context of the conversation.",

      "term": "からすると・からすれば",
      "meaning": "Judging from, Considering",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While similar in conveying a perspective, からすると/からすれば emphasizes inference or deduction based on evidence, whereas 上 focuses more on the overall context or established rules."

      "meaning": "Speaking in terms of, From the point of view of",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 上 presents an objective standpoint from a specific field or perspective, while the other expressions offer different ways of expressing perspective or opinion, often involving subjective judgment or inference."
