    "etymology": "The particle 「な」 is thought to have originated from the older prohibitive 「禁止」, which softened over time into its current form. Its usage is similar to imperative forms, but instead of commanding action, it commands inaction.",
    "writeup": "「な」 is a sentence-ending particle used to express a strong prohibition. It's attached to the dictionary form of a verb to tell someone **not** to do something. It carries a stern, often emotional tone. It is generally used by male speakers but may be used by female speakers when talking to someone younger, in an informal situation, or in a close relationship. Think of it as a more direct and less polite version of 「～ないでください」.",
