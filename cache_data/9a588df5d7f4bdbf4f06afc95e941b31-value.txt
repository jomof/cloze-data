  "writeup": "や is a particle indicating a non-exhaustive list.  Unlike と (to), which suggests a complete enumeration, や (ya) implies that other items could be added.  Think of it as 'things like A and B,' leaving the door open for more possibilities.  It's used primarily with nouns, directly following them.  This nuanced distinction is crucial for natural-sounding Japanese.  Mastering や (ya) adds depth to your expressions and avoids the overly precise, sometimes unnatural feel of always using a complete list.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of や is complex and not fully understood, but it's believed to have evolved from a contraction or alteration of other particles indicating a similar sense of non-exclusivity.  Its use developed naturally through the communicative evolution of the language, reflecting a preference for suggesting inclusion rather than providing a rigidly complete list.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the exhaustiveness of the list.  と (to) is exhaustive; the others are not.  Choose based on whether you want to suggest a complete set of items or just give examples.  Consider the formality of the situation when selecting between や (ya) and its more formal counterparts."
