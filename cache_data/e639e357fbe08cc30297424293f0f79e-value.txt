  "etymology": "なるべく is a compound word combining なる (naru, to become) and べく (beku, a suffix indicating desirability or appropriateness).  The original meaning reflects the idea of something becoming possible or permissible, hence its current usage suggesting the best possible effort or course of action.",
  "writeup": "The adverb なべく (narubeku) translates to \"as much as possible\" or \"wherever practicable.\"  It expresses the speaker's desire for an action to be done to the greatest extent possible, given circumstances.  It's often used before a verb or verb phrase.  While similar to できるだけ (dekirudake, 'as much as possible'), なべく carries a softer, more polite tone, emphasizing the intention rather than the absolute capability.  Think of it as expressing a preference or a strong suggestion rather than a demand.",

      "conjugation": null,

      "japanese": "新しい仕事は大変だけど、なるべく前向きに頑張ろうと思う。",

    }

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while なべく suggests doing something to the fullest extent possible, it doesn't imply a strict obligation.  The level of effort is contextual and depends on the surrounding words and situation.",

    {
      "term": "できれば・できたら",
      "meaning": "If possible",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike なべく, which implies effort towards a goal, できるだけ (dekirudake) and できれば/できたら (dekireba/dekitara) simply express conditional possibility without emphasizing the effort involved.  They suggest a lower level of commitment."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the nuance of intention. なべく emphasizes the speaker's desire to do something to the greatest extent possible, while できるだけ and できれば/できたら simply state the possibility of an action.  The former shows intent and effort; the latter only condition."
