  "writeup": "まだ～ていません, meaning \"still haven't done...\", is a fundamental N5 grammar point combining the adverb まだ ('still', 'yet') with the te-form of a verb and the negative polite form of いる (imasen).  It's used to express that an action hasn't been completed up to the current time.  The te-form connects the preceding action to the state of incompletion.  Understanding the te-form is crucial here; it's not simply adding 'still not' to the end of a sentence. This grammatical structure allows for a concise way to express a continuing lack of completion of an action.  It's a versatile construction used in everyday conversation.",
  "etymology": "The structure relies on the established usage of まだ (mada, still/yet) indicating a point in time, and the continuous aspect implied by the negative form of いる (iru, to be/exist).  The te-form functions as a linking element, indicating that the previous action is relevant to the current incomplete state.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "私はまだご飯を**食べていません**。",

      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "polite negative",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「食べていません」, the polite negative form, indicating respect for the listener, regardless of age or gender.  The speaker's older age is suggested by their formal speech style."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼とまだ会って**いない**よ。",
      "english": "I still haven't met him, you know.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「いない」, a casual plain negative form, common in informal speech among younger speakers. The 「よ」 adds emphasis and friendly informality."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "宿題をまだ**やっていません**。すみません。",
      "english": "I still haven't done my homework. Sorry.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": "polite negative",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "This polite phrasing shows the speaker's remorse for not finishing their homework.  The polite form 「やっていません」is crucial for conveying apology appropriately."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたとまだ話して**いません**でしたから、少しお話しましょうか？",
      "english": "Since I haven't spoken to you yet, shall we chat a bit?",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "polite negative",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the polite past negative 「いませんでした」to create a gentle, polite opening for a flirtatious conversation.  The question at the end softens the potentially direct nature of the statement. The male speaker uses a polite phrasing to be inviting, not presumptuous."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あのね、君のことがまだ好きで**いない**なんて、ありえないよ！",
      "english": "Hey, it's impossible that I'm not still in love with you!",

      "setting": "intimate",
      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The use of 「いない」in 「好きでいない」is highly informal, only acceptable in very close relationships. The sentence structure and exclamations show excitement and intense feelings."
    }
  ],
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "false_friend": "まだ",
      "nuance": "While まだ also means 'still' or 'not yet,' it doesn't inherently imply an incomplete action.  It simply indicates a time frame. まだ～ていません adds the crucial element of an action not yet completed."
    },
    {
      "false_friend": "Verb[volitional]とする",
      "nuance": "The volitional form する (suru) expresses intention or attempt.  まだ～ていません describes a state of incompletion, not necessarily a failed attempt."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the focus: まだ focuses on time, while まだ～ていません focuses on the uncompleted state of an action.  The volitional form implies intent;  まだ～ていません describes the current reality of the action being undone."
