  "writeup": "いい (ii) is an i-adjective meaning 'good.'  Its conjugation differs from other i-adjectives. Note how the initial 'i' changes to 'yo' in past and negative forms. This is unique to いい and doesn't apply to other i-adjectives. You might also see it written as 良い (yoi), usually read as 'yoi' and sounding slightly more formal or old-fashioned.  There's no practical difference in meaning between いい and 良い.  **Important:** When used adverbially, よく (yoku) should not be confused with a conjugation of いい.  よく has various kanji origins and means 'often,' 'frequently,' or 'well.'",
  "etymology": "The word いい likely originates from a Proto-Japonic word, possibly related to other words expressing pleasantness or goodness.  The modern form shows irregular conjugation patterns, reflecting semantic and phonological changes over time.",

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The sentence ender ね (ne) softens the statement, making it more friendly and suitable for a female speaker. 「いいね！」is commonly used in casual conversations."

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses わ (wa), a female-specific sentence ending, adding a touch of gentleness to the statement. 「わね」is a typically feminine way of speaking."

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The sentence ender な (na) expresses a sense of admiration. 「いいな」is often used by males to express a casual appreciation. The use of 君 (kimi) for 'you' is less formal and therefore contributes to a flirty tone."
