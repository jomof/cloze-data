  "writeup": "The adverbial particle こそ, when followed by the realis form (sometimes called the perfective form) of verbs, creates a nuanced expression primarily used in formal settings.  This construction, while having roots in classical Japanese, lacks a direct modern equivalent. The hypothetical form has largely superseded the realis form in modern conjugations.  The verbs most commonly used in this construction are する ‘to do’, なる ‘to become’, and ある ‘to be’, transforming into こそすれ, こそなれ, and こそあれ, respectively. These forms serve to emphatically contrast two statements.  Common translations include ‘certainly not (B), but (A)’ or ‘even though (B), actually (A)’, where (B) is typically a negative statement that the speaker is correcting or responding to.  こそすれ can attach to the noun part of する-verbs or the conjunctive form of standard verbs. なれ and あれ are used according to the standard rules governing なる (with nouns or adjectives) and ある (with nouns).  **Important Consideration:**  The base verb might be modified beforehand with causative or passive auxiliary verbs; therefore, identifying the actual verb stem is crucial for proper analysis. This grammar point is rarely used in casual conversation and is more common among older generations.",
