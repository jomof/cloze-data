    "writeup": "しかも is a conjunction in Japanese which is commonly translated as either \"furthermore\" or \"moreover\". This is a somewhat formal grammar pattern which indicates that both (A) and (B) exist at the same time, or are in unison. しかも itself focuses on the overall topic, so will be used for giving objective opinions, such as observable facts, rather than personal opinions.\n\nAs しかも is a conjunction, it may be used between two phrases, or sometimes at the beginning of a second sentence, when referring back to the first. Often, (A) will be considered the \"base\" information, while (B) is extra information added on top of (A), or further explaining (A).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n- しかも is generally considered more formal than other similar conjunctions like それに or おまけに.\n- It's used to add information that reinforces the initial point, often presenting it as an additional benefit or fact.\n\n**Etymology:** Originally, しかも came from the combination of the archaic interjection 然 (しか 'as such', or 'like that'), and the particle も ('too', or 'also'). In this way, some reflection can be seen between it and modern English phrases like \"additionally\", where the (B) information is simply adding on to what is already known about (A). In modern writing, しかも may also appear as either 而も or 併も, although both are quite rare.",

Consider the level of formality and whether the additional information is simply another fact or if it's meant to be something extra, unexpected, or intensifying."
