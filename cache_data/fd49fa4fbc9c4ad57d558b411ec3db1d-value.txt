    "etymology": "The phrase 「以上」 (ijou) literally means \"more than\" or \"beyond.\" When used with 「は」 (wa), it creates a nuance of \"now that\" or \"since a certain condition has been met.\" The 「は」 (wa) emphasizes the condition as a given premise, upon which the subsequent statement is based.",
    "writeup": "「以上(は)」 (ijou (wa)) is a conjunction used to express a strong logical or natural connection between what precedes it and what follows. It conveys a sense of \"now that,\" \"since,\" \"as long as,\" or \"if...at all.\" It indicates that, given a certain situation or condition, a particular outcome or action is expected or should naturally follow. This grammar point is versatile, connecting clauses with a firm implication of consequence or obligation. Be mindful of the level of formality; 「以上(は)」 is generally used in more formal settings.",
