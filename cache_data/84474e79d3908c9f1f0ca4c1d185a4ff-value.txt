    "etymology": "The etymology of 「それ」 comes from the verb 「沿う (そう)」 meaning to follow or conform to. It indicates something that is in agreement or related to something previously mentioned or understood between the speaker and listener.",
    "writeup": "「それ」, much like 「これ」, functions as a pronoun (or, more precisely, a substitute noun) in Japanese. It generally translates to \"that\" and points to something physically or emotionally closer to the listener than the speaker. It can also refer back to something already mentioned in the conversation. Think of 「それ」 as bridging a connection between the speaker and listener, indicating a shared understanding or focus.",
