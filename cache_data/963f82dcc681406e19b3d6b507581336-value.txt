    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb **まい** is used in Japanese to express negative volition or a weak inference of negation. It can be thought of as the negative counterpart to the volitional forms う and よう. **まい** attaches directly to the base form (辞書形) of verbs and carries a somewhat formal nuance. It can be translated as \"won't,\" \"intend not to,\" or \"probably not.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Formal Tone:**  **まい** is generally considered a more formal expression and is more common in written language or formal speech.\n*   **Variations with する and 来る:** When used with the verbs する (to do) and 来る (to come), variations like **しまい**, **すまい**, **きまい**, and **こまい** are frequently encountered alongside the standard **するまい** and **来るまい**. These variations have the same meaning.",
