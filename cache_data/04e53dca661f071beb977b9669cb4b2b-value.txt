    "etymology": "場合 (baai) means \"case\" or \"situation\". は (wa) is the topic marker particle, indicating that the preceding noun is the topic of the sentence. Therefore, 場合は literally means \"as for the case/situation...\"",
    "writeup": "**場合は (baai wa)** is a phrase that translates to \"in the event of (A)\" or \"in the case of (A)\". While 場合 itself means \"case\" or \"situation\", adding the topic particle は gives it a nuance of specifying a hypothetical situation or a characteristic/viewpoint, often in contrast to something else. It's versatile and can be used with various word types: verbs (any form), い-adjectives, な-adjectives (requiring な), and nouns (requiring の). Remember that 場合 has a nuance of randomness, so it's not suitable for planned or regular events; use ～とき instead.",
