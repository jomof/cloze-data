    "etymology": "その is related to the demonstrative pronoun それ (sore), indicating something near the listener. Its origin can be traced back to older forms of Japanese where demonstratives were more closely tied to spatial relationships.",
    "writeup": "その is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞, rentaishi) in Japanese. These words do not conjugate, meaning その always appears in the same form. It indicates something closer to the listener than the speaker. Think of it as \"that one there\". As a pre-noun adjectival, その always comes before a noun and modifies it.",
