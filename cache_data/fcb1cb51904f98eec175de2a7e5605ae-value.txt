  "writeup": "ようでは is a fascinating grammatical construction. It combines the auxiliary verb 様 (さま, 'manner' or 'seeming') with では (dewa), a conjunction often shortened from それなら (sorenara, 'if that's the case').  This results in a nuanced meaning of 'if,' with a strong emphasis on the perceived or apparent nature of the condition.  It suggests that the speaker is making a judgment based on observation, hinting at uncertainty or a subjective evaluation.  We might translate it as 'if it is the case that...' or 'if what appears to be... is true.'  Generally, ようでは is used to express a negative consequence stemming from a preceding condition. It typically follows verbs in their plain forms. The subjective, almost speculative nature of ようでは makes it a powerful tool for expressing one's opinion about what seems to be true.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of ようでは lies in the combination of 様 (sama), an auxiliary verb indicating manner or appearance, and では (dewa), a shortened form of それなら (sorenara), meaning 'if that's so' or 'in that case.' The combination subtly implies a conditional judgment based on observation rather than definite knowledge.",

      "japanese": "毎日遅刻する**ようじゃ**、クビだぞ！",
      "english": "If you keep being late every day, you're fired!",

      "setting": "commanding",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「ようじゃ」 and the blunt command 「クビだぞ！」 are both highly casual and characteristic of a male speaker giving an order to a male subordinate or peer.  The phrase emphasizes the speaker's judgment based on the observation of repeated lateness."

      "japanese": "こんな簡単な問題も解けない**ようじゃ**、もっと勉強しなきゃね。",

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「ようじゃ」 and 「ね」 is a familiar, casual way for a female speaker to give advice to another female, perhaps a friend or younger person.  The gentle tone contrasts with the potential seriousness of the advice itself, indicated by 「もっと勉強しなきゃね」."

    {
      "japanese": "その程度のことで動揺する**ようでは**、この仕事は務まりませんよ。",
      "english": "If you're going to get flustered over something so trivial, you can't handle this job.",

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「～ませんよ」 combined with the more formal 「ようでは」 indicates a professional setting where a female superior is addressing a male subordinate. The speaker's judgment is clearly presented as an observation about the listener's ability to handle the job. Note how 「～ませんよ」 is a more formal variation of 「～ないよ」 which is more suited for female to female conversation."

      "conjugation": "past (plain)",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「～だった」 puts the emphasis on what appeared to be the case in the past. The playful and flirtatious tone of 「メロメロになっちゃうわよ」 is appropriate for a female speaker expressing feelings to a male listener. The use of わよ is also key here."

      "japanese": "もっと私のことを知りたい**ようでした**ら、今度一緒に食事に行きませんか？",

      "conjugation": "past (polite)",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「～でしたら」 creates a soft and inviting atmosphere, suitable for a first encounter. The suggestion of going out to eat implies a romantic interest, yet the politeness avoids being too forward. This is quite an advanced and sophisticated way of flirting."

      "meaning": "If, With, Since, Because",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike ようでは, which emphasizes the observed appearance of a condition, ては is a more general conditional conjunction used in a wider variety of situations and less emphasis on the speaker's subjective opinion."

      "meaning": "It seems that, It appears that, It looks like",
