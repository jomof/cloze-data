    "writeup": "The word 「いくら」 fundamentally asks 「How much?」or 「How many?」. However, it has extended uses that are crucial to understand.\n\n**Key Uses:**\n\n*   **Inquiry about Amount/Price:** This is the most basic usage, asking about a quantity or the cost of something.\n\n*   **\"No Matter How Much/Often\"**: 「いくら」 followed by 「～ても」 expresses that no matter how much of something is done, a certain result will still occur. For example, 「いくら食べても」 means \"no matter how much I eat.\"\n\n*   **\"Any Amount is Okay/There is Plenty\"**: 「いくらでも」 suggests that any quantity is acceptable, or that there is an abundance of something. For example, 「いくらでもいいです」 means \"any amount is fine.\"\n\n*   **\"Not Much/Hardly Any\"**: 「いくらも」 with a negative verb indicates a small amount or infrequent occurrence. For example, 「いくらも食べない」 means \"I don't eat much.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The 「～ても」 construction emphasizes the futility or inevitability regardless of the quantity or effort.\n*   「いくらでも」 indicates a willingness to accept any amount or the existence of a large quantity.\n*   「いくらも」 implies scarcity and is always used with a negative verb.",
    "etymology": "「いくら」's etymology is somewhat uncertain, but it is believed to be related to the verb 「幾つ (ikutsu)」, meaning \"how many?\" or \"how old?\" Over time, 「いくら」 evolved to encompass both quantity and price.",
