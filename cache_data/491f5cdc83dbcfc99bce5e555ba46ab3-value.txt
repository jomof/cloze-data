        "Alternatives": "Similar expressions include 「とは言っても」 and 「とは言うものの」."
    },
    "etymology": "「とは言え」 is derived from the verb 「言う」(iu, to say) and the particle 「と」, indicating a quote or content. The phrase literally translates to 'although it is said that,' implying that despite what has been said, there is another aspect to consider.",
    "writeup": "「とは言え」 is a conjunctive phrase used to express contrast or concession. It's similar to \"although,\" \"even though,\" or \"that being said.\" It acknowledges the preceding statement but introduces a contrasting or qualifying point. This expression is typically used in more formal writing and speech. The 「だ」 after a な-adjective stem or noun is omitted.",
