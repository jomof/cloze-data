  "writeup": "The negative form of the verb 兼ねる, 'to spread across' (usually two different activities or thought processes), forms a grammar pattern indicating the possibility of something happening, especially something beyond the speaker's control.  かねない is often translated as 'might (A)', 'capable of (A)', or '(A) is a possibility'. This structure is typically attached to the masu-stem of verbs or follows nouns with に.  Both kanji and non-kanji forms are used. It's common to see かねない after conditional phrases including と, ば, たら, でも, and similar structures.  This implies that 'if (A) were to happen, (B) may also occur'.  **Important Consideration:** While often used for negative outcomes, it can also express a sarcastic desire or wish.  Etymologically, since 兼ねる means 'to spread across', the negative form can be understood as similar to 'it wouldn't be a stretch' in English, simply indicating the action is within the realm of possibility for the subject.",
  "etymology": "The grammar point かねない is derived from the verb 兼ねる (かねる), meaning \"to combine,\" \"to do in addition to,\" or \"to double as.\"  In its negative form, かねない, the sense of combining is lost, and it takes on the meaning of potential or possibility, especially of negative consequences.  This semantic shift is fascinating, highlighting how negation can drastically alter the meaning of a verb.",
