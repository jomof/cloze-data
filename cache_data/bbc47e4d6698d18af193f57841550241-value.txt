    "etymology": "The て form of a verb indicates a sequence of actions or a means of doing something. The particle で marks the means, method, or location where an action occurs.",
    "writeup": "The conjunction particle 「て」, or the case marking particle 「で」 are often used to highlight when something is being \"used.\" The thing being used does not necessarily need to indicate a tool but can also indicate a circumstance/situation. In these cases, 「(A)で(B)」 translates as \"with/by means of (A), (B).\" \n\n**Important Consideration:**\nWith 「て」 (and 「で」), the nuance is quite often that 「(A) allowed/led to (B)」. This may be a simple sequence of events, or may be through the direct use of a tool/situation. The nuance that is being highlighted will always depend on the (B) phrase. Due to this, it is important to always read the (B) clause before deciding what the speaker is trying to convey.",
