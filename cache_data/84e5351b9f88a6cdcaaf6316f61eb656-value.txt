    "etymology": "The 「ん」 in 「んばかり」 is a shortened form of 「ない」, the negative auxiliary verb. 「ばかり」 means \"almost\" or \"on the verge of.\" The 「に」 functions as an adverbial particle, modifying the verb that follows. Thus, the entire expression literally translates to \"almost not doing,\" implying that the action is nearly happening or about to happen.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「んばかり(に)」 is used to describe situations where something is **almost** happening or **appears** to be on the verge of happening. It conveys a sense of near-occurrence or an impression of imminence. It's often used to exaggerate or emphasize the intensity of a situation. It's often seen in formal writing and speech.",
