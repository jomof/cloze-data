    "etymology": "Derived from the noun 「様 (よう)」 meaning 'state,' 'appearance,' or 'way.' The particle 「に」turns it into an adverbial form, indicating 'in the manner of' or 'like'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ように」 expresses similarity, acting as an adverb to describe how something is, or how an action is performed. It translates to \"like,\" \"as,\" or \"as if.\" It connects two elements, indicating a resemblance. \n\n*   With verbs and い-adjectives, use the dictionary form directly before 「ように」.\n*   With な-adjectives, add 「な」 before 「ように」.\n*   With nouns, add 「の」 before 「ように」. \n\nThis is distinct from 「ように」used to express purpose, which requires a different grammatical structure.",
