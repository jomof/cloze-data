  "writeup": "The suffix がたい, attached to the conjunctive form of verbs, means '(A) is difficult to do'.  While sharing a kanji root with 難しい (muzukashii, 'difficult'), がたい carries a stronger connotation than にくい (nikui, 'difficult/unpleasant').  Unlike にくい, which can express subjective difficulty, がたい emphasizes the inherent, objective difficulty of a task—often implying near impossibility.  It's almost always written in hiragana.  Think of it this way: にくい describes something difficult based on personal feelings or experience; がたい indicates difficulty inherent to the task itself.",
