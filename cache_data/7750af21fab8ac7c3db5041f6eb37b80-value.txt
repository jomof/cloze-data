  "writeup": "The grammar point なければいけない expresses obligation or necessity.  It literally translates to \"if it's not done, it won't do,\"  highlighting the unavoidable nature of the action.  This construction uses the negative conditional form of a verb (verb + なければ) followed by いけない, meaning \"cannot do.\"  While grammatically a double negative, it functions as a strong affirmative of obligation.  The polite form is なければなりません.  This structure is common in both spoken and written Japanese, particularly in formal contexts.  While often used in formal settings, it can be adapted for informal situations as well.  Note that the いけない part can sometimes be omitted in casual conversation, especially among close friends or family.",
  "etymology": "The structure arises from the combination of the conditional form (ば-form) of the negative verb ない and いけない (an informal contraction of 行けない, \"cannot go,\" implying impossibility). It reflects a logic of necessity where failure to act leads to an undesirable outcome.  The polite form replaces いけない with ならない, stemming from the verb なる, \"to become.\"",
