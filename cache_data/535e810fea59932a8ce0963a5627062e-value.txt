  "writeup": "からといって (kara to itte) is a Japanese grammatical construction meaning \"just because.\"  It expresses the idea that one fact doesn't automatically lead to another conclusion.  The structure combines the particle から (kara, 'from'), と (to, a conjunction particle), and the て-form of the verb 言う (iu, 'to say').  It's often used to temper an assumption or to suggest that a certain cause doesn't necessarily guarantee a specific effect.  Think of it as a nuanced way of saying, \"Just because A is true, doesn't mean B is also true.\"  This construction is versatile and frequently used in various registers, from casual conversations to more formal settings.  While standard Japanese, you will commonly find more colloquial abbreviations like からとて (kara tote) and からって (kara tte) that maintain the same core meaning.  These shortened forms are generally acceptable in informal conversation.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of からといって is straightforward.  It's a combination of から (kara, a particle indicating reason or cause), と (to, a conjunction particle connecting clauses), and the て-form of 言う (iu, 'to say').  The て-form implies a kind of conditional statement, forming the underlying structure of the expression. The phrase literally means something along the lines of 'from the fact of saying that...', emphasizing the conditional and potentially negating the following clause.",

      "nuance": "The use of よ (yo) at the end makes the sentence more casual and friendly.  It also suggests a conversational, possibly gossipy, tone. The use of イケメン (ikemen) is more common in female speech. 「イケメン」 is a common term used among younger women when referring to attractive men."
