    "writeup": "「だ」 is the plain form of the copula, equivalent to \"is\" or \"to be\" in English. It indicates a state of being or identification. It's a very basic and common grammar point, essential for forming simple sentences. Note that 「だ」 is considered casual. Its polite equivalent is 「です」. 「だ」 follows nouns and な-adjectives. Do **not** use 「だ」 directly with い-adjectives; instead, use 「です」 or the plain form of the い-adjective.",
    "etymology": "The origin of 「だ」 is debated, but it is thought to have evolved from classical Japanese auxiliary verbs.",
