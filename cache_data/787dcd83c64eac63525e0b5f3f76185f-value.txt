    "etymology": "The origins of が are debated, but it's believed to have evolved from older particles and possessive markers in classical Japanese. It gradually became specialized as a subject marker, differentiating itself from other particles like は.",
    "writeup": "が is considered the subject marker in Japanese. It marks the **grammatical subject** of a sentence, indicating the person or thing performing an action or possessing a specific characteristic. This particle highlights what comes before it, contrasting it with other potential subjects. が is typically used when introducing new information or emphasizing the unique status of the subject.\n\n*   が always shows the \"target\" of a statement when other targets also exist. This is why が is used to describe situations that are happening either \"in the moment\" or \"individually of other things\".\n*   が is not usually used to describe something about yourself unless you are intentionally describing yourself compared to other people. If you want to talk about yourself \"in general terms,\" は will sound more natural (there are exceptions).",
