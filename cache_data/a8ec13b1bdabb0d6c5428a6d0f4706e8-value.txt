    "etymology": "The kanji 上 (jou) literally means \"above\" or \"on top.\" In this grammatical context, it carries the sense of being \"above\" or \"over\" a certain topic or field, indicating a viewpoint or perspective.",
    "writeup": "上 (jou) functions as a suffix, attaching to nouns to indicate that something is being presented \"from the standpoint of\" that noun. This \"standpoint\" is usually a specific field or area of concern, such as 仕事 (work), 教育 (education), or 法律 (law). The rest of the sentence then describes what is being considered from that perspective. It's similar to saying 「に関して」 (\"in connection to\"). This construction is quite formal. Remember, 上 cannot be used to express an individual person's point of view.",
