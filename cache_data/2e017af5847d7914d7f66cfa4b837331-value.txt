    "writeup": "「をよそに」 is used to express that someone is disregarding or ignoring a certain situation or someone's feelings while proceeding with their own actions. It implies that the situation being ignored is relevant and should ideally be considered.  It can be translated as \"ignoring,\" \"disregarding,\" or \"despite.\" The phrase literally means something like \"making something else (余所) out of [something] (を),\" and then acting \"in that state (に).\"  It attaches directly to nouns or noun phrases (often nominalized with 「の」). This grammar point is considered formal and is more commonly found in written Japanese.  The structure often presents a contrast between a situation (A) that is being overlooked and the action (B) taken without considering it.  It frequently carries a critical nuance, suggesting that the action taken is irresponsible or inconsiderate. **Important Consideration:** While 「をよそに」 describes the actions of people, it is generally not used to describe the speaker's own actions.",
