    "meaning": "Supposed to, Should, That's the way it is",
    "etymology": "「もの」 originates from the noun 「物」, generally referring to a 'thing' or 'object'. Here, it functions as a nominalizer, turning the preceding phrase into a noun-like concept. 「だ」 is the plain form of the copula, signifying 'is'. Thus, 「ものだ」 literally implies 'it is a thing that'.  Over time, this evolved to express general truths, expectations, and recollections.",

    "writeup": "「ものだ」 (mono da) combines the nominalizer 「もの」 (mono), meaning 'thing', with the copula 「だ」 (da), meaning 'is'.  This grammar point expresses several nuances related to general truths, common sense, and recollections. It often translates to \"is supposed to be,\" \"should be,\" or \"that's just the way it is.\" Think of it as stating something is inherently a certain way, based on societal norms, natural tendencies, or past experiences. \n\n**Key uses of 「ものだ」:**\n\n*   **Expressing general truths or common sense:** This usage highlights things considered natural or expected.  For instance, 「子供は元気なものだ」 (kodomo wa genki na mono da) conveys the general expectation that children are energetic.\n*   **Expressing what one should do or not do:** 「ものだ」 can indicate what is considered appropriate or inappropriate behavior.  For example, 「ごみを道に捨てるもんじゃない！」 (gomi wo michi ni suteru mon janai!) strongly advises against littering.\n*   **Expressing a feeling of nostalgia or recollection:**  In this case, 「ものだ」 brings back memories and a sense of how things used to be. While less obvious in the provided examples, it's a significant function.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The shortened form 「もんだ」 (monda) is common in casual speech, especially among males. Be mindful of the context when you hear or use it.\n*   The negative form 「ものではない」 (mono de wa nai) expresses something contrary to what is expected or appropriate.",
