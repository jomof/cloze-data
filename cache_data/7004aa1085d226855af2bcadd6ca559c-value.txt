    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずに済む」 is composed of 「ず」, an auxiliary verb similar to 「ない」 (not), 「に」, a particle, and 「済む」, a verb meaning \"to be finished\" or \"to be sufficient.\" Thus, the literal sense is \"to finish without doing\" something.",
    "writeup": "「ずに済む」 indicates that one can \"get by without doing (A)\" or that \"it's no problem without (A).\" 「ず」 is similar to 「ない」 and attaches to verbs in the same way. 「済む」 is a verb meaning \"to come to pass\" or \"to end up.\" Literally, it suggests \"it will work out without (A).\" Because 「済む」 controls the meaning, other negations such as 「ないで済む」 may also be seen.\n\nIn most cases, (A) is something unpleasant or bothersome, highlighting the speaker's relief that it can be avoided.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「ずに済む」 often implies a sense of relief or good fortune that something was avoided.\n*   The nuance is that the speaker expected or anticipated having to do something, but circumstances allowed them to avoid it.",
