    "etymology": "連用形 (ren'yōkei) literally translates to \"connecting use form.\" It derives from the idea that this form connects to other words and phrases to create compound meanings. 「連用」 (ren'yō) means 'connecting use' and 「形」 (kei) means 'form'. It describes how this form is used to connect different parts of a sentence in a smooth and grammatically correct way.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese grammar, the 連用形 (ren'yōkei) is a conjunctive form often referred to as the \"ます-stem\" or simply \"conjunctive form.\" The term \"conjunctive form\" is more accurate as it applies to more than just verbs. It represents the form used for standard conjugation with other grammatical structures. For い-adjectives, this is the く-form, and for verbs, it's the ます-stem.\n\nThe 連用形 (ren'yōkei) is also sometimes referred to as 'the formal conjunctive' because of its use before a comma to connect clauses. While the て-form typically serves this purpose, the formal conjunctive allows for a similar connection without using て. It is **important** to note that while て is not required, a 読点 (Japanese comma) is often needed to prevent confusion.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The 連用形 (ren'yōkei) is primarily found in formal writing. The て-form is much more common in everyday speech.\n*   Using the 連用形 (ren'yōkei) gives your writing a more polished and sophisticated tone.",
