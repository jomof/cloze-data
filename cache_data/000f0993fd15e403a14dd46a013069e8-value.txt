    "etymology": "「余儀なく」is derived from 「余の儀」 (yo no gi), meaning 'another way' or 'alternative method'. The 「なく」 part comes from the negative form of the adjective 「ない」. 「させる」is the causative form of 「する」 (to do). Therefore, the entire expression literally means 'to not give another way than to do (A)'.",
    "writeup": "「を余儀なくさせる」 is a formal grammar pattern that translates as “to be forced to (A)”, but with the nuance of *causing* that state. The base is similar to 「を余儀なくされる」, but it uses the causative auxiliary verb 「させる」 'to make do' in place of the passive 「される」 'to have done to one.' Its component parts are the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「余儀」 'another method', the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective 「ない」, 「なく」, and the causative form of 「する」, 「させる」. In this way, it literally means 'to not give another way than to (A)'. 「を余儀なくさせる」 will be seen following an (A) noun, where (A) is the thing that is unavoidable.\n\nUnlike 「を余儀なくされる」, in most cases the (A) subject of sentences that use 「を余儀なくさせる」 will be a non-human cause. However, there are exceptions to this.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n*   Despite 「余儀」 and 「ない」 being separate words, 「余儀なく」 is often thought of simply as a single word that means 'unavoidably', or 'inevitably'.",
