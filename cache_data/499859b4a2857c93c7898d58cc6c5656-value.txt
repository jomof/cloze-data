    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てごらん」 is derived from the te-form of a verb combined with 「ご覧 (goran)」, which means \"to look\" or \"to see\" (honorific). The 「て」 form indicates a request or suggestion. Thus, 「てごらん」 literally means \"try looking\" but is used more broadly to suggest trying something.",
    "writeup": "「てごらん」 is an expression used to make a suggestion or give a mild command, similar to 「なさい」. It translates to \"(Please) try to\" or \"(Please) look.\" The verb is conjugated into its te-form and connected to 「ごらん」.\n\nThough 「ご覧」 literally means \"to look\" or \"to peruse,\" 「てごらん」 implies a more general suggestion to try something at one's leisure. Think of it as similar to 「てみる」 (\"to try\") but with a softer, more encouraging nuance.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Because 「ご覧」 is honorific, it's **only used to suggest actions to others**, never for your own actions.\n*   The combination 「ごらんなさい」 is sometimes used, intensifying the suggestion and making it sound more like a light command. As such, it is primarily used by superiors or elders when asking a subordinate or younger person to try something.\n* This grammar point is considered rather masculine. Women are much more likely to use 「てみなさい」.",
