It means \"therefore,\" \"so,\" \"and then,\" or \"because of that.\" It essentially says, \"as a result of the previous statement, this is what follows.\"\n\n*   It's often used at the beginning of the second sentence to highlight the connection to the first.\n*   It can also mean \"and then?\" in conversational contexts, especially when someone is narrating a story and you want them to continue.\n\n**Important Note:**\n\nBe careful not to confuse 「それで」 with 「それでは」. 「それでは」 (or the shortened form 「それじゃ」) means \"well then,\" \"in that case,\" or \"if so.\" The 「は」 here is the topic marker particle.",
