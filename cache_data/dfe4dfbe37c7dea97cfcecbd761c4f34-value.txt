  "writeup": "The adverb わざわざ (waza waza) indicates that someone has gone out of their way to do something.  It implies a deliberate effort, often exceeding what's expected or necessary.  Think of it as conveying 'expressly,' 'especially,' or 'taking the trouble to.'  It's usually placed at the beginning of a sentence, emphasizing the intentional nature of the action. While generally positive, it can also highlight unnecessary effort or even negative intent, depending on context.  The nuance depends heavily on the situation.  For example, \"わざわざ手伝ってくれた\" (waza waza tasukette kureta) – 'You went out of your way to help me' – expresses gratitude. Conversely, \"わざわざ文句を言う\" (waza waza monku o iu) – 'To expressly complain' – carries a negative connotation.  Be mindful of the context to accurately convey the intended meaning.  This is a very common word, used across all age ranges and genders.",
