    "meaning": "Used to express a topic and then focus on a specific attribute or aspect of that topic. Indicates that the topic 'A' has the attribute or characteristic 'C' related to 'B'. Can also show contrast, 'A is (topic), but B (focus)'.",
    "details": {
        "Structure": "A は B が C: A (topic) has a characteristic C related to B.",
        "Usage": "Used to emphasize a specific aspect of a topic. It's like saying, 'Speaking of A, its B is C.'"

    "etymology": "The particle 「は」 marks the topic of the sentence, indicating what is being talked about. The particle 「が」 marks the subject within the topic, highlighting a specific attribute or aspect. Together, 「は〜が」 creates a structure to introduce a topic and then focus on a particular detail about it.",
    "writeup": "The 「は〜が」 construction is fundamental in Japanese grammar for expressing a topic and then focusing on a particular aspect or attribute of that topic. Think of it as saying, \"Speaking of A, its B is C.\" The 「は」 particle marks the topic, and the 「が」 particle highlights a specific attribute within that topic. This construction can also subtly imply a contrast.\n\nFor example, 「象は鼻が長い」 (Zou **wa** hana **ga** nagai) means \"Elephants have long trunks.\" Here, 「象は」 marks \"elephants\" as the topic, and 「鼻が長い」 focuses on the characteristic of having a long trunk.",
