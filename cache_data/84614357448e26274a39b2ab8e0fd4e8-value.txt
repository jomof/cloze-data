  "writeup": "ばよかった (ba yokatta) is a common expression conveying regret for something not done.  It combines the conditional particle ば (ba) and the past form of the i-adjective いい (ii, 'good').  While literally translating to 'it would have been good if...', it's best understood as expressing a missed opportunity or a wish for a different past action.  It follows verbs, requiring the standard ば (ba) conjugation before adding よかった (yokatta).  This contrasts with ばいい (ba ii), its non-past counterpart, expressing a wish for a future action.  Mastering this nuance is key to expressing regret naturally in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The structure is built upon the conditional particle ば (ba), indicating a hypothetical situation, combined with よかった (yokatta), the past form of いい (ii), meaning 'good.' The combination elegantly expresses the wish that a different action had been taken in the past.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "高速に乗る前にトイレに行けばよかった。",
      "english": "I should have gone to the bathroom before getting on the highway.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence is a simple expression of regret, suitable for casual conversation. The use of 「トイレに行けばよかった」 (toire ni ikeba yokatta) is straightforward and easily understood."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "もっと早く出発すればよかった。",
      "english": "I should have left earlier.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Similar to the previous example, this is a straightforward expression of regret about a past action. The structure, 「もっと早く出発すればよかった」(Motto hayaku shuppatsu sureba yokatta), remains simple and natural in casual conversation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼女に告白すればよかったと、今更ながら後悔している。",
      "english": "I regret now that I should have confessed my feelings to her.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This example shows a more nuanced use of the grammar point. The addition of 「今更ながら後悔している」 (imasara nagara kōkai shite iru) adds a layer of depth and maturity to the expression of regret, making it suitable for a semi-formal context.  The use of 「告白すればよかった」 (kokhaku sureba yokatta) is still straightforward but more sophisticated within the context of the sentence."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "もっと勉強しておけばよかった。試験が難しすぎた。",
      "english": "I should have studied harder. The exam was too difficult.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the phrase to express regret in a slightly more complex situation.  The second part of the sentence explains the reason for the regret, making it more nuanced than the first example.  The expression 「もっと勉強しておけばよかった」(Motto benkyou shite okeba yokatta) is common and easily understood in casual settings."

      "japanese": "あの時、君の気持ちを受け止めていればよかった…。",
      "english": "If only I had accepted your feelings back then...",
      "register": "intimate",
      "setting": "melancholic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the grammar point to express a deep, heartfelt regret. The ellipsis (...) adds to the emotional weight. The intimate register is created by the direct and vulnerable expression of regret. The use of 「君の気持ちを受け止めていればよかった」 (kimi no kimochi o uketome te ireba yokatta) is emotionally charged and suitable for a close relationship."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "もっと早くあなたに会っていればよかった。",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "This sentence is an example of using ばよかった in a flirty context.  The 「あなたに」 (anata ni) is a polite but slightly formal way of addressing the listener that softens the directness of the regret. It implies a deeper connection and romantic interest. The use of 「もっと早くあなたに会っていればよかった」 (Motto hayaku anata ni atte ireba yokatta) is a subtle way of expressing attraction."

      "meaning": "I'm glad that...",

    }

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that ばよかった expresses regret about the past, while たらいい/といい expresses a hope for the future. てよかった expresses satisfaction with a past action.  Focus on the temporal aspect (past vs. future) to choose the correct expression."
