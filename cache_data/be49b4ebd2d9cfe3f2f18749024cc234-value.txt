    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ていた」 is formed by combining the て-form of a verb with the past tense of the auxiliary verb 「いる」. 「いる」 originally means \"to exist\" (animate objects) and, when used in the ている form, indicates a continuing state or an ongoing action.  Therefore, 「ていた」 signifies a continuing state or ongoing action in the past.",
    "writeup": "「ていた」 (or its more polite form 「ていました」) is used to express that something **was happening** or someone **was doing something** in the past. It combines the て-form of a verb with the past tense of the verb 「いる」 (to exist).  Similar to the English \"was doing,\" it indicates a past continuous action or state. Sometimes, 「ていた」 can also describe a past action or state where the consequences or state resulting from that action are still relevant or under consideration by the speaker.  For instance, it can imply uncertainty or be used to offer polite advice based on a past observation.",
