  "etymology": "The 「くない」 form is derived from the い-adjective stem (e.g., 暑 -> 暑く) combined with 「ない」, which indicates negation. 「ない」 itself functions as an い-adjective here, allowing for further conjugations.",
  "writeup": "The negative form of い-adjectives in Japanese is created by changing the final 「い」 to 「くない」. For example, 「暑い」 (atsui, hot) becomes 「暑くない」 (atsukunai, not hot). The 「ない」 used with い-adjectives acts as another い-adjective itself. This means it can be conjugated further. The polite negative form is 「くありません」. Remember that い-adjectives, whether positive or negative, cannot be used with 「だ」, although 「です」 is acceptable in spoken language.",

      "speaker_gender": "female",

      "nuance": "The casual tone with 「ね」 suggests a friendly interaction between peers. The grammar point 「くない」 negates the い-adjective 「大きい」. The female speaker's use of 「ね」 adds a gentle, seeking agreement tone, often heard in casual female speech."
