    "etymology": "「あれ」 comes from the archaic Japanese demonstrative pronoun 「彼（あれ）」, which also meant 'that (over there)'.  The kanji 彼 is still sometimes used, although it's not common for this usage of 「あれ」.",
    "writeup": "「あれ」, similar to 「これ」 and 「それ」, is a Japanese pronoun that refers to something.  In English, 「あれ」 translates to \"that over there.\" The key difference between 「あれ」 and 「それ」 is distance.  「それ」 refers to something near the listener but away from the speaker, or something previously mentioned by either person.  「あれ」, on the other hand, points to something that is distant from *both* the speaker and the listener.  Think of it as pointing to something further away.  It's **important** not to confuse this 「あれ」 with the interjection 「あれ？」 which expresses surprise or confusion, like \"huh?\" or \"oh?\". The context and intonation will usually make the distinction clear.",
