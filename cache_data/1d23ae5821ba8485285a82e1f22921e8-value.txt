    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 originally indicated a co-occurrence or simultaneity. Its use as a conditional evolved from this, implying that when one thing happens, another invariably follows.",
    "writeup": "The 「と」 conditional expresses a natural, predictable, or inevitable consequence. Think of it as \"when A happens, B *always* happens.\" It's stronger than other conditional forms like 「ば」, 「たら」, or 「なら」 because it highlights a result that is considered a given. It's used for: \n\n*   **General truths or habits:** Things that are always true. \n*   **Directions or instructions:** Describing a sequence of actions with guaranteed outcomes.\n*   **Discoveries:** Describing what one finds upon doing something. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The 「と」 conditional describes something inevitable or natural. Avoid using it for hypothetical situations or possibilities.\n*   The verb in the 「と」 clause is always in the non-past form, even if referring to a past event. The tense is indicated in the result clause.\n*   You will often see it used in directions, because directions are generally reliable.",
