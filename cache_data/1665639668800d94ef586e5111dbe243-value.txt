    "etymology": "並びに (narabini) comes from the verb 並ぶ (narabu), meaning \"to line up\" or \"to be side by side.\" The に (ni) turns it into an adverbial form, suggesting that the items connected are being placed alongside each other in importance or consideration. It carries a more formal and somewhat literary nuance compared to simpler conjunctions like と (to) or や (ya).",
    "writeup": "並びに (narabini) is a conjunction used to connect two nouns or noun phrases. It is similar to \"and\" in English, but it carries a more formal and somewhat literary tone. It's often used in official documents, legal texts, formal speeches, and academic writing. It implies that both items being connected are equally important. Unlike と (to), 並びに (narabini) is not used to list multiple items, but rather to connect two significant items.",
