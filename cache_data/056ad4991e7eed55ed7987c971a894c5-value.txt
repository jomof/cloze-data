    "etymology": "「如何」originated as a word meaning \"how\" or \"in what way,\" sharing its kanji with 「如何に」. Over time, it evolved to take on the meaning of \"depending on,\" often used in formal contexts.",
    "writeup": "「如何」 (ikan) is a formal expression primarily meaning \"depending on.\" It is derived from an older adverb meaning \"in what way.\" Typically, it follows a noun, often with the particle 「の」. It is usually followed by 「だ」 (da) at the end of a sentence, or 「で」 (de) when used mid-sentence. 「如何によっては」 is sometimes used, emphasizing the \"depending on\" aspect, which can be translated as \"depending on how (A) turns out, (B).\" It's similar to 「次第」 (shidai), implying that the degree of (A) determines the result. Thus, it's often followed by verbs related to decision-making, like 「決まる」 (kimaru, to be decided). 「如何」 is a more formal equivalent of 「どう」 (dou, how).",
