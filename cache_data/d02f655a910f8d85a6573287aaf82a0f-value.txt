    "writeup": "そういえば is a set phrase in Japanese.  It's derived from the adverb そう, meaning \"like that\", and the conjunctive form (ba-form) of the verb 言う (いう), meaning \"to say\". Literally, it could be interpreted as \"if one says that\". However, its function is to introduce a topic that the speaker has just been reminded of due to the preceding conversation. Think of it as a way to smoothly transition to a related but perhaps slightly different point. Common English translations include \"speaking of which\", \"by the way\", and \"come to think of it\".\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   そういえば connects to something already mentioned in the conversation. It's not used for completely unrelated topic shifts like the English \"by the way\" sometimes is.\n*   そういえば is similar in function to といえば. The main difference is that といえば directly references a specific topic or word, whereas そういえば refers more broadly to the preceding situation or flow of conversation.\n*   It almost always appears at the beginning of a sentence.",
