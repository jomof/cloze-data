  "writeup": "The third common use of ている (often shortened to てる in casual speech) describes repetitive actions.  It's not about an action *currently* in progress, but one performed so often it's considered habitual or continuous, like daily routines or hobbies.  Because いる implies 'existence', ている is best understood as 'existing in a state of regularly performing an activity'.  To clarify, time expressions such as 毎日 (mai-nichi, every day), 毎晩 (mai-ban, every night), and 毎週 (mai-shū, every week) are frequently used.  In novels and manga, and in some regional dialects, とる (toru) may be used synonymously.",
  "etymology": "The ている form is a combination of the て-form of a verb and the verb いる (iru), meaning 'to be' or 'to exist'.  The て-form indicates a completed action or state, while いる anchors it to the present, thus creating the sense of ongoing state or habitual action.",
