It often introduces something unexpected, negative, or particularly noteworthy, adding weight to the initial statement. It can be translated as \"what's more,\" \"and moreover,\" or \"on top of that.\" It is similar to 「しかも」, but 「それも」 often carries a stronger nuance of adding something unexpected or even undesirable. Note that 「それも」 connects phrases or clauses, highlighting a specific aspect or consequence. The nuance can range from simply adding information to expressing surprise or exasperation.",
