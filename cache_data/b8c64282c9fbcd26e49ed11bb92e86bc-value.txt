  "writeup": "ようによっては (yō ni yotte wa) is a nuanced expression in Japanese that signifies the outcome depends entirely on the method or approach.  It's a sophisticated way to express conditional results based on how something is done.  The structure combines 様 (yō) meaning 'manner' or 'way,' the particle に (ni) marking the object of the verb, よる (yoru) meaning 'to depend on,' and は (wa) as a topic marker.  This phrase typically follows the -te form of a verb, emphasizing the variability of results depending on the chosen method or perspective.  While seemingly similar to 方 (kata), which also signifies a 'way' or 'method,' ようによっては carries a stronger implication of significant variation in outcomes based on the approach.  Therefore, it is generally used in situations where the differences between methods are substantial.",
  "etymology": "The phrase is a combination of 様 (yō, manner, way), に (ni, particle indicating the object of the verb よる), よって (yotte, the te-form of よる, to depend on), and は (wa, topic-marking particle).  様 (yō) itself is an older, more formal variant of 方 (kata, way, method), reflecting the slightly more formal nuance of ようによっては compared to simply using 方. The use of よる emphasizes the dependence of the result on the manner or way in which something is done.",
