    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てみる」 combines the te-form 「て」, which connects actions, with the verb 「見る (みる)」, meaning 'to see'. Thus, literally, it means 'to do and see', which is interpreted as 'to try (something) and see what happens'.",
    "writeup": "To express that you will try something, the te-form of a verb is combined with 「みる」 (usually written in hiragana). While translated as \"to try to (A)\", it suggests doing (A) to see what the result will be. This construction is typically used when trying something for the first time. The phrase 「てみて」, or the more formal 「てみてください」, is used to suggest that someone else should try something. In very casual speech, 「てみ」 may be used alone, conveying \"come on, just give it a go!\". When 「てみた」 appears in the past tense, it implies that the attempt was successful, unless stated otherwise. While 「見る」 can be written in kanji, doing so stresses the \"see\" meaning rather than \"try\", which can cause misunderstanding.",
