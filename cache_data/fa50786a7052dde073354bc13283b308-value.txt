    "writeup": "When the adverb 陸に (rokuni) 'satisfactorily' appears in negative sentences (ない), it indicates that something is \"not satisfactory\", \"not enough\", or \"not being done properly\". This grammar pattern appears at the beginning of phrases. The latter part of the sentence will include a negative word, often a verb in its potential negative form (～られない). While ろくに will often appear in hiragana, it can also be written in kanji as 陸に. Alternatively, 碌に may also sometimes be seen, but this particular kanji is *ateji* (a kanji used purely for its pronunciation, not its meaning).\n\nThis grammar point often carries the nuance of something being done without sufficient effort, or being half-baked.\n\n**Fun fact**: 陸 (roku) literally means \"land\".  When used with the reading \"roku\" in this context, it carries the nuance of flatness, correctness, or seriousness – implying a lack of these qualities when used with a negative.",
