    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を経て」 comes from the verb 「経る (へる)」 which means \"to pass, to elapse\". It carries the nuance of undergoing a process or period of time.",
    "writeup": "「を経て」 is a relatively formal grammar point used to emphasize the passage of time, or that an event took a certain amount of time or a specific route. The verb 「経る (へる)」 itself means \"to elapse\" or \"to pass\" in terms of time. It differs from 「過ぎる」, which also means \"to pass time,\" in that 「過ぎる」 focuses on having reached the end point. In contrast, 「経る」 focuses on what was happening during the period leading up to that end point.  Because of this, 「を経て」 can also be translated as \"having undergone (A)\", highlighting the preceding action. 「を経て」 directly follows nouns. The remainder of the sentence usually describes the significance of that passage of time or experience, or what happened as a result. Due to its formal nature, 「を経て」 is often seen in biographies, introductions, and similar media.",
