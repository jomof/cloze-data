    "etymology": "The word 「どうしても」 is formed from 「どう」 (how) and the 「ても」 form of 「する」 (to do), which is 「しても」.  Literally, it means 'even if doing in any way', conveying the idea of something being unavoidable or desired regardless of the circumstances.",
    "writeup": "「どうしても」 is a versatile expression in Japanese, functioning primarily as an adverb. It conveys a strong sense of inevitability, determination, or desire. You can think of it as meaning \"no matter what,\" \"regardless of anything,\" or \"by all means.\"  It often appears at the beginning of a sentence to emphasize the speaker's firm stance or the unavoidable nature of a situation.  For instance, saying 「どうしても欲しい」 means you want something **no matter what**.  Alternatively, when placed after a verb with the particle 「と」, it indicates that a certain outcome is unavoidable if a particular condition is met. For example, 「牛乳を飲むとどうしてもお腹が痛くなる」 expresses that drinking milk will **inevitably** lead to a stomachache.  While the literal breakdown is 'how + even if doing', understanding its idiomatic usage is key.",
