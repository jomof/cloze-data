    "writeup": "Although rarely seen in its kanji form, **につき** is a grammar pattern that comes from a combination of に and the conjunctive form of the う-verb 就く (つく) meaning \"to take up (A)\" or \"to assume (A).\" This original meaning is often associated with assuming a new position, like a new job. However, the meaning conveyed by the grammar point **につき** is closer to \"due to (A), (B),\" \"on account of (A), (B),\" or \"for each (A), (B).\"  **につき** directly follows nouns, and the (B) part of the sentence describes what is happening \"due to\" or \"on account of\" (A). This grammar point is quite formal and frequently appears in formal documents, announcements, and notifications.\n\nRegardless of the various common English translations, the core sense of \"to affix to (A)\" remains in all uses of **につき**. It implies that (B) is a response to, directly linked to, suitable for, or caused by (A).",
