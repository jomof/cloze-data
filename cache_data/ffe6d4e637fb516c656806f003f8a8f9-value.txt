  "writeup": "**なさる (nasaru)** is a polite verb meaning \"to do.\"  It's an honorific form, showing respect for the actions of the person being discussed.  Crucially, **never** use なさる to describe your own actions; that's grammatically incorrect and sounds unnatural.  It's a direct, respectful replacement for する (suru), maintaining the same core meaning while adding a layer of formality and deference.  Its conjugations, while similar to う-verbs in the casual form, have unique polite conjugations, notably the change from る to い in the polite non-past form. While some less formal variations exist, they're generally less common.  Using it correctly demonstrates a nuanced understanding of keigo (honorific speech). Important Considerations: Avoid creating double keigo by pairing it with other honorific verbs.  While acceptable in some contexts, it's generally best to keep it simple and elegant.  For instance,  \"社長はゴルフをなさっています\" (The president is playing golf) is perfectly fine and commonly used.  Overly formal expressions like \"なさっていらっしゃる\" (a double honorific) are often perceived as awkward or overly formal.  This verb is used across all ages and genders but remains less frequent in very casual settings.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of なさる is quite fascinating.  It's derived from the ancient verb なし (nasi), meaning \"to do,\" which underwent sound changes over centuries. The addition of the honorific suffix -る (-ru) transformed its basic meaning into the respectful, polite form we use today. This subtle but significant change reflects the rich evolution of Japanese politeness expressions.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to avoiding confusion among these similar verbs lies in understanding the level of formality and the speaker-listener relationship.  Consider whether you need to express humility (いたす), give a command (なさい), show respect to the other person (なさる, お～になる), or use plain speech (する).  Context and intent are crucial for proper word choice."
