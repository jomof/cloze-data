  "writeup": "This grammar point, \"ものとする\", translates to \"shall,\" \"to assume,\" \"to suppose,\" or \"to consider.\" It's a formal expression used primarily in legal and official documents.  The \"もの\" (mono) element signifies a strong determination or assumption, while \"とする\" (to suru) indicates the establishment of this assumption as a fact for the sake of discussion or the given context.  Think of it as establishing a rule or condition within a specific framework. It often appears at the sentence's end, adding a firm, decisive tone. Understanding its formal register is crucial; using it in casual conversation would sound extremely unnatural and stiff.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of ものとする is straightforward.  'もの' (mono) is a noun meaning 'thing' or 'object,' but in this context, it functions as a nominalizer, taking the preceding clause and turning it into a thing that is being defined. 'とする' (to suru) is a common verb phrase meaning 'to do' or 'to treat as.' In combination, they create a construction for declaring a fact or establishing a condition, often with legal implications.",

      "japanese": "住民税は世帯主が払うものとする。",
      "english": "The head of the household shall pay the resident's tax.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the plain form of the verb \"払う\" (harau) within the \"ものとする\" construction. This is suitable given the informative and formal context. The phrasing is unambiguous and consistent with official pronouncements.  The entire sentence, 「住民税は世帯主が払うものとする。」, is extremely formal, and would not be used in daily life."

    {
      "japanese": "契約者の都合で解約をした場合、契約者に解約金を請求するものとする。",
      "english": "In the event that the subscription is canceled due to the subscriber's personal reasons, a termination fee shall be charged to the subscriber.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "legal",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This example perfectly illustrates the legalistic application of \"ものとする.\" The sentence structure ensures clarity and avoids ambiguity, which is essential for contracts. The use of 「契約者」 (keiyaku-sha, contractor) and the conditional phrasing points to a formal, and possibly legal, context. The whole structure, 「契約者の都合で解約をした場合、契約者に解約金を請求するものとする。」, would only be used in legal or contractual settings."

    {
      "japanese": "この仮説を正しいものとするならば、次の結論が導き出せる。",
      "english": "If we assume this hypothesis to be correct, the following conclusion can be derived.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "academic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Here, \"ものとする\" is used to introduce a hypothetical scenario within an academic context. The formality of the sentence matches the setting, and the use of 「仮説」 (kasetsu, hypothesis) and 「結論」 (ketsuron, conclusion) reinforces the academic tone.  The phrasing, 「この仮説を正しいものとするならば」 conveys intellectual rigor and adherence to established scholarly conventions."

        {
      "japanese": "今夜の予定は、君と二人きりで過ごすものとする。",
      "english": "Tonight's plan is for us to spend time together, just you and me.",
      "register": "shitashii kuchō",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「君」 (kimi) and the implication of intimacy elevate the meaning. The sentence, 「今夜の予定は、君と二人きりで過ごすものとする。」, is a flirty suggestion, conveying a sense of confidence and expectation. While seemingly using a formal structure, the context changes the meaning to be more intimate. Only a close relationship warrants this kind of playfulness with such a formal structure."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Note that while \"ものとする\" carries a formal connotation, the choice of surrounding vocabulary and overall sentence structure can subtly adjust the level of formality. In less formal, yet still polite settings, slightly different phrasing might be chosen. The key is to always assess the context and choose language accordingly.",
