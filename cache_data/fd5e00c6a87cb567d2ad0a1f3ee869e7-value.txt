  "etymology": "The term \"あげく\" (ageku) originally referred to the final line of a 連歌 (renku), a collaborative form of Japanese poetry.  It literally means \"the concluding phrase\" or \"the tying-up phrase.\"  Its evolution into a grammatical particle reflects the natural progression of language, adapting the sense of conclusion to describe the ultimate outcome of a preceding series of events.",
  "writeup": "The particle \"あげく\" (ageku) signifies a negative or undesirable outcome following a preceding series of events or actions.  It implies a sense of culmination, often after much effort or time spent.  It's frequently used when the escalation of prior events directly leads to the unfortunate conclusion.  \"あげく\" typically follows past-tense verb forms or nouns followed by \"の.\" While it's often written in hiragana, the kanji forms 挙げ句 (ageku) and 挙句 (ageku) are also common.  Understanding its subtle nuances is key to mastering its use. It's important to note that the final outcome is explicitly negative or unsatisfactory;  it's the *process* leading to the outcome that is emphasized.  While the outcome itself might not always be inherently bad, the path to reaching it was troublesome or unpleasant.",
