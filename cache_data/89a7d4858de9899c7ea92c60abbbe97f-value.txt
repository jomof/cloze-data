    "writeup": "そこで (very rarely seen as 其処で) combines そこ \"there\" with the case marking particle で. It's often translated as \"to that end\" or \"accordingly.\" Literally, it means \"at that place,\" with で's function as \"with\" or \"by\" indicating that an action will be performed in that situation. This phrase is similar to \"as such\" in English.\n\nTypically, the first sentence describes a situation, and そこで then explains how that situation was or will be resolved. Because で implies the \"use\" of something, this expression is best suited for highlighting controllable actions or decisions arising from a preceding circumstance.",
