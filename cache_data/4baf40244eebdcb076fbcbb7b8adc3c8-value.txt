    "etymology": "The 'て' form comes from the conjunctive particle 'て', which is also used to connect verbs. 'で' is the conjunctive form of the copula 'だ'.",
    "writeup": "The 'て' form of an い-adjective or the 'で' form of a noun (or な-adjective) functions similarly to the 'て' form of a verb, connecting clauses and indicating a reason or manner.\n\nFor い-adjectives, change the final 'い' to 'くて'. For example, '新しい' (atarashii, new) becomes '新しくて' (atarashikute, new and...). Note that いい becomes よくて.\n\nFor nouns and な-adjectives, add 'で' to the base form (without 'な' or 'だ'). For example, '綺麗' (kirei, beautiful) becomes '綺麗で' (kirei de, beautiful and...). This 'で' is a form of 'だ'.\n\n**Meanings:**\n\n*   Linking: Similar to \"and\" in English.\n*   Reason: Similar to \"because of\" or \"due to\" in English.\n*   Manner: Describes how an action is performed.",
