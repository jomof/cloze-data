    "etymology": "来る (kuru) originates from the Old Japanese verb 'ku,' which also meant 'to come.' Over time, the verb evolved, adding the 'ru' ending to become the modern form.",
    "writeup": "**来る (kuru)** is one of the two main irregular verbs in Japanese, the other being する (suru). It means \"to come\" or \"to be coming.\" When using 来る, the destination is typically marked with the particles に or へ. Because 来る conjugates irregularly, it doesn't follow the standard Godan or Ichidan verb conjugation patterns. Instead, the く part of the verb changes depending on the conjugation, similar to both る-verbs (where る is dropped) and う-verbs (where く changes). For instance, we have きた (past tense), くる (present tense), and こない (negative). 来ている (kite iru) often indicates that someone has arrived at a place and remains there. Because ている signifies 'the state of an action,' it can mean either 'to be somewhere after having come' or 'to be in the process of coming.' Distinguishing between these two meanings often requires additional context. However, 来ている for existing at a place is generally used for temporary locations, not for one's home or workplace.",
