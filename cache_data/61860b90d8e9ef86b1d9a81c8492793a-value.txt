  "etymology": "にもかかわらず is a compound structure.  に is a particle indicating the topic or focus. も is the particle emphasizing 'even'. かかわらず comes from the verb 拘わる (kakawaran), meaning 'to be concerned with' or 'to stick to', conjugated into its negative potential form using the auxiliary ず (zu).  This negative potential aspect is crucial to the meaning of 'despite' or 'in spite of'. The combination conveys a sense of something happening despite an expectation or a contrasting situation.",
  "writeup": "にもかかわらず is a formal Japanese grammatical construction expressing the meaning of \"despite,\" \"in spite of,\" \"regardless,\" or \"nevertheless.\" It's a sophisticated way to show contrast between two situations or facts.  This construction combines the particle に (topic marker), the emphatic particle も (even), and the verb かかわらず, derived from 拘わる (kakawarazu, meaning 'to be concerned with' or 'to be committed to'), conjugated into a form expressing \"without being affected by.\"  The structure is often used with verbs, い-adjectives, and nouns in their plain forms. While literally it could be interpreted as  \"without being affected by (A), (B) happens,\" its practical usage aligns perfectly with the English \"despite\" or \"in spite of.\"  It's crucial to avoid confusing にもかかわらず with にかかわらず; while similar, にかかわらず tends to imply \"no matter what\" or \"regardless of.\"  The addition of も in にもかかわらず significantly affects the nuance, adding an element of unexpectedness or contrast.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to avoiding confusion lies in understanding the subtle differences in nuance.  While these expressions can sometimes be interchangeable, choosing the most appropriate one depends on the level of emphasis you wish to place on the contrast, the overall tone, and the specific relationship between the two clauses. Consider whether you are simply stating irrelevance (を問わず), emphasizing a simultaneous action (ながらも), highlighting a contradiction with criticism (くせに), or simply showing contrast (にもかかわらず)."
