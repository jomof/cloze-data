    "etymology": "The particle へ originates from the verb 「経(へ)る」 (heru), meaning \"to pass through\" or \"to go through\". This etymological connection highlights the particle's fundamental sense of movement or direction towards a particular place or destination.",
    "writeup": "へ is a particle used to indicate the direction of movement, signifying \"to\" or \"toward\" a place. It emphasizes the direction or path being taken. While often interchangeable with the particle に, へ carries a nuance of movement and the effort involved in reaching the destination.\n\n*   へ focuses on the **direction or path of movement**.\n*   に emphasizes the **arrival point or destination**.\n\nFor example, in expressions like 「大阪へようこそ」 (Ōsaka e yōkoso - Welcome to Osaka), へ conveys a sense of acknowledging the effort made to arrive in Osaka. This is why expressions like 「テレビへようこそ」 (terebi e yōkoso - welcome to the TV show) sound polite, acknowledging the viewers' effort to select that show.",
