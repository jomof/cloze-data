  "writeup": "にする is a versatile grammatical structure combining the particle に (indicating a target or destination) with the verb する (to do).  It signifies \"to make something into,\" \"to decide on,\" or \"to choose.\"  The key nuance is the speaker's direct control over the outcome, implying a sense of deliberate choice. The noun preceding にする is the object of the decision.  While often translated as \"to decide,\" it's closer to the English slang 'to do (A)', as in 'I'll do a beer'.  This highlights the direct action involved.  The structure can extend beyond tangible objects to encompass abstract nouns.  The alternative とする, while conveying a similar meaning, subtly shifts the nuance.  と suggests a less forceful, more tentative decision, often appearing in formal contexts due to its softer tone.  Consider the difference: に emphasizes direct selection, while と implies a more indirect decision, akin to \"I'll go with...\".",
  "etymology": "The structure's etymology is straightforward: the combination of the particle に, expressing direction or target, and the verb する, meaning 'to do' or 'to make'. Its meaning is a natural consequence of this combination.",
