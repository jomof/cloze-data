    "writeup": "The grammar point あまりに is used to express that something is **excessive** to the point of causing a specific result. It conveys a sense of surprise or shock at the degree of something. It's often translated as \"so much (A) that (B)\" or \"way too much (A).\" あまりに is similar to \"excessively (A), so (B).\"\n\n*   When あまりに is followed by a noun, it's typically linked with the particle の, as in 「あまりの Noun」.\n*   The colloquial variant あんまり is frequently used in speech but should be avoided in formal writing.",
