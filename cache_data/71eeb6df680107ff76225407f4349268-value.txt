    "etymology": "「方」 (kata) literally means \"direction,\" \"way,\" or \"method.\" When attached to the ます-stem of a verb, it takes on the meaning of \"way of doing\" or \"how to.\" This usage extends the core meaning of \"way\" to describe the manner or method of performing an action.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「かた」 (kata) attaches to the ます-stem of a verb to express \"how to do something\" or the \"way of doing something.\" It's essentially a noun-forming suffix that turns a verb into a noun phrase describing a method or manner.\n\nFor example:\n*   「読み方」 (yomikata): way of reading, how to read\n*   「使い方」 (tsukaikata): way of using, how to use\n\nWhen used with 「する」 (suru) verbs, you'll often encounter 「仕方」 (shikata), which carries the same meaning but can be thought of as the \"way of dealing with\" or \"attending to\" something. In this case, the 「する」 verb is followed by 「の」, then 「仕方」. For example: 「勉強の仕方」 (benkyou no shikata) means how to study, or the way to study. \n\nAfter attaching 「方」 to a verb, the entire expression functions as a noun phrase, allowing it to be followed by particles like 「は」, 「を」, and others to create more complex sentences.",
