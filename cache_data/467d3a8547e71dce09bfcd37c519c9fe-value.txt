  "writeup": "The construction 〜に〜ない is a nuanced expression used to convey the inability to perform an action, even with the desire to do so.  It's often translated as \"cannot even… if wants,\" \"would like to… but cannot,\" or \"wants to… but cannot.\"  This structure uses the particle に after the dictionary form of a verb, followed by the negative potential form of the same verb (or できない for する-verbs).  The literal meaning is closer to \"regarding [action], [action] is not possible.\"  The choice of dictionary form versus volitional form (e.g., using う or よう before にも) subtly shifts the emphasis. The dictionary form often highlights psychological or circumstantial limitations, while the volitional form emphasizes more concrete obstacles.  This grammar point is suitable for standard registers and general situations.",
  "etymology": "This construction leverages the established usage of the particle に to indicate a purpose or reason. Combined with the potential form negated by ない, it creates a layered meaning indicating an inability despite intention. The potential form itself has roots in the classical language's potential verb conjugations, a testament to the linguistic evolution of expressing inability.",
