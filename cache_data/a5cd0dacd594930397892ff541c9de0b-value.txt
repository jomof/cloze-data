  "etymology": "The grammar point にかけては originates from the verb 掛ける (かける, kakeru), meaning \"to hang\" or \"to suspend.\"  In this context, it's not about literal hanging, but rather the metaphorical \"hanging\" of one's attention or focus on a particular area of expertise. The particle は marks the topic, emphasizing the area of expertise being discussed.",
  "writeup": "The phrase にかけては, literally \"as for hanging,\" is used to express superiority or expertise in a specific field or area.  It's a nuanced expression that highlights someone's exceptional skill or knowledge within a particular domain.  It translates to \"when it comes to...,\" \"regarding...,\" or \"concerning...\" in English.  This construction always presents a positive aspect; using it to point out a weakness would sound unnatural.  The structure involves the particle に, followed by the te-form of 掛ける (かける, kakeru) and the topic-marking particle は.  Be mindful of the difference between this expression and にかけて which indicates a time span or range. This is crucial to avoid confusion and ensure accurate use.",
