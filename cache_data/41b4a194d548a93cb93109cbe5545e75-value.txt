    "etymology": "The grammar point 「も構わず」combines 「も」 (particle indicating 'also' or 'even'), 「構う」 (kamau, meaning 'to mind' or 'to care about'), and 「ず」 (zu, a literary auxiliary verb similar to 「ない」, indicating negation). Therefore, it literally means 'without minding' or 'without caring about'.",
    "writeup": "「も構わず」 is used to express that someone does something without regard for a particular concern or consequence. It combines 「も」, the verb 「構う」 meaning \"to mind\" or \"to care\", and the literary auxiliary verb 「ず」, which functions similarly to 「ない」. Common translations include \"without worrying about (A), (B)\" and \"without minding (A), (B)\".\n\nIt can follow nouns directly or verbs, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives (with the addition of 「の」 after verbs and い-adjectives, and 「な + の」 after な-adjectives). 「にも構わず」 can also be used for added emphasis. It's used to show that the speaker is ignoring or not concerned about (A), and the (B) part highlights what is being done without considering (A). 「構う」 itself means \"to brace\" or \"to give pause\", so 「も構わず」indicates a lack of hesitation or concern.",
