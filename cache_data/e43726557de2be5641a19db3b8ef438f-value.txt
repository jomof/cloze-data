    "etymology": "「即ち」comes from the verb 「即く(つく)」, which means 「すぐに」 or 「その場で」 (immediately, or on the spot). Over time, it evolved to mean 'in other words' or 'that is,' indicating an immediate clarification or restatement.",
    "writeup": "「即ち」 (sokuchi) is similar to 「つまり」, functioning as a conjunction to connect two sentences. It translates to \"in other words,\" \"that is,\" or \"namely.\" 「即ち」indicates that the second sentence clarifies or restates the first, providing further explanation or specification. The nuance is that of 'agreeance' or 'correspondence' between the two statements.",
