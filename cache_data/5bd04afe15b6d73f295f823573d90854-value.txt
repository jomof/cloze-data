  "writeup": "The suffix 型 (kata, sometimes がた gata) indicates the model, type, pattern, kind, shape, or size of a noun.  It's frequently attached directly to nouns, or to い-adjectives.  Occasionally, you'll see 型 used after the particle の (no), in which case it's read as かた (kata), not がた (gata). While 形 (kata) can also function similarly, 型 is far more common in everyday speech due to subtle differences in meaning. 型 emphasizes the form or design, including abstract types, while 形 primarily denotes physical shapes (e.g., square, triangle).  It's crucial to note that in certain contexts, 型 might be read as がた (gata) using its on'yomi (音読み), especially when paired with other words using on'yomi readings, or when it's not a suffix but part of a compound word.  Mastering this subtle distinction enhances your understanding of nuanced Japanese expression.",
  "etymology": "The kanji 型 means \"mold\" or \"form,\" reflecting its function as a suffix to describe the type or shape of something.  This reflects the historical use of molds to create consistent shapes. The less frequent 形 (kata) means \"shape,\" but is mostly reserved for simple geometric forms.",

      "speaker_gender": "male",

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the nuance of 型 depends heavily on context.  The word itself is neutral, but the surrounding words and the situation will heavily influence how it's interpreted. Consider the overall tone and relationship of those involved in the conversation.  This will provide additional meaning to the interaction.",
