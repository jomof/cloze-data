  "etymology": "The word 何 (nani) means 'what', and か (-ka) is a particle indicating a question.  何も (nanimo) adds も (mo), meaning 'all' or 'even', to the question, thus shifting the meaning to 'nothing'.  The combination reflects the interrogative origin and the subsequent modification to express negation.",
  "writeup": "何か (nanika) and 何も (nanimo) are crucial N5 particles expressing \"something,\" \"anything,\" or \"nothing.\"  The key distinction lies in their usage with positive and negative sentences.  何か is used in affirmative or interrogative contexts, while 何も is exclusively paired with negative predicates (those containing ない or ありません).  Simply place 何か or 何も before the phrase you wish to modify. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n* Casual spoken forms, such as なんか (nanka) and なんにも (nanni mo), exist but should be avoided in formal settings.  They can sound informal or even slightly rude, depending on context.\n* Mastering the appropriate usage of 何か and 何も is fundamental for expressing nuanced meanings in Japanese sentences.",

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「何も」 with the negative verb 「食べたくない」 correctly conveys the lack of desire.  The casual register makes this appropriate for a close friend or family member."

      "japanese": "彼は何か面白いことを言った。",
      "english": "He said something funny.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "storytelling",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「何か」 implies an unspecified funny thing, making the sentence appropriate for casual conversation.  The sentence is not overly casual as it does not utilize colloquialisms."

      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "supportive",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite 「ありません」 paired with 「何も」 creates a reassuring and comforting tone.  This formal approach demonstrates respect and care for the listener."

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The 「な」 in 「なにか」 softens the sentence, making it suitable for an intimate relationship. The use of 「あげたい」 is naturally used by males to suggest a favour to their loved ones.  The intimate register reflects the close relationship between speaker and listener.  The implied action is suggestive, enhancing the flirty nature of the sentence."
