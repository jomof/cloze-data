  "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the い-adjective conjugation where the final 「い」 is dropped and replaced with 「く」. 「なかった」 is the past negative form of 「ない」. Thus, it literally combines the adjectival stem with the past negative auxiliary.",
  "writeup": "To form the negative past tense of **い-adjectives**, you must first convert the adjective to its 「く」 form. This is achieved by dropping the final 「い」 and adding 「く」 to the stem. This 「く」 form is then followed by the past negative auxiliary. For the plain form, use **くなかった**. For example, 「高い」 (takai, expensive) becomes 「高くなかった」 (takaku nakatta, was not expensive).\n\nFor the polite form, the 「く」 form is followed by **ありませんでした**. Thus, 「高い」 becomes 「高くありませんでした」 (takaku arimasen deshita, was not expensive – polite). This form originates from the original polite negative conjugation of the verb 「ある」 (aru, to be/exist), which is 「ありませんでした」.\n\nIt is crucial to note that in contemporary Japanese, particularly in everyday conversation, it is extremely common to use the plain form **くなかった** followed by **です** to achieve a polite nuance. This **くなかったです** construction is widely accepted and often preferred for its slightly softer, more casual politeness compared to the more formal **くありませんでした**.",

The phrasing 「全然退屈じゃありませんでした」 (zenzen taikutsu ja arimasen deshita, \"was not boring at all\") is an indirect compliment, suggesting enjoyment without explicitly stating 'I enjoyed it', which is a common nuanced communication style in Japanese, especially among women."

  "changes": [
    "violation: `formation` changed from semantic variations to direct formation `い-Adjective (remove い) + く + なかった` and `い-Adjective (remove い) + く + ありませんでした`. Reason: The instruction states 'the formula for creating the grammar point from its component parts'. The prior `formation` was too simplistic and did not fully capture the two primary ways this grammar point is formed.",
    "violation: Refined `writeup`. Reason: The prior `writeup` did not fully capture the common usage of `くなかったです` as explicitly as the original Bunpro source intended, which is crucial for natural Japanese usage. This clarification aligns with the persona's goal to share 'details, nuances, and beauty of the language'.",
    "violation: Modified existing examples by removing extraneous spaces in Japanese sentences. Reason: Rule 6. 'The 'japanese' **must** have spaces between words, so that it is easy to read.' This implies spaces *between words*, not within kanji compounds or particles attached to nouns/verbs, which the original examples sometimes incorrectly included.",
    "violation: Modified existing examples (Ex1, Ex3, Ex4) to adjust `scene`, `setting`, and add `speaker_age`/`listener_age` and `nuance`. Reason: Rule 6. requires examples to exhibit a wide variety of registers, settings, and demographic information, along with `nuance` explanations.",
    "violation: Added three new examples (flirty, first-date, and another `くありませんでした` example). Reason: Rules 7 and 8 explicitly require a flirty and a first-date example. Rule 6. also requires example sentences to exhibit a wide variety of conjugations, which these new examples help achieve by increasing the representation of `くありませんでした`.",
    "violation: Removed old example 6. Reason: Rule 8 states 'without using the word 'date'', and the deleted example included the word 'デート'."
