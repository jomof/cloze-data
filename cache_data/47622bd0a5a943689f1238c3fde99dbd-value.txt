    "etymology": "「の」 here is a nominalizer, turning the verb into a noun phrase. 「が」 marks the noun phrase as the subject of the sentence. 「下手」 (heta) means unskilled or poor at.",
    "writeup": "「のが下手」 is used to express that someone is bad at doing something. 「下手」 is an *adjectival noun* (or na-adjective), so it's followed by 「だ」 in plain form and 「です」 in polite form. The verb before 「の」 must be in its dictionary form. To express that someone *was* bad at something, conjugate 「下手」 into the past tense (「だった」 or 「でした」), while the verb remains in the dictionary form. Remember that 「のは」 cannot be used with this phrase; use 「のが」 instead.",
