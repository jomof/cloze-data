  "writeup": "The expression と言わず (toiwaazu) is a sophisticated grammatical construction used to emphasize the inclusiveness of a statement. It's not merely about A or B, but encompasses A, B, and everything else within the same category.  Think of it as 'not just A or B, but all,' or 'A, B, and everything else.'  This elegant phrase is a combination of the quotative particle と, the negative stem of the verb 言う (iu, to say), 言わ (iwa), and the literary form ず (zu) of the classical auxiliary verb ぬ. The literal translation, 'without saying A, without saying B,' might seem confusing, but it effectively conveys the 'all-encompassing' nuance.  Crucially, both A and B should logically belong to the same group.  For instance, hands and feet are body parts; morning and afternoon are parts of a day. Using と言わず～と言わず with unrelated items sounds unnatural.  Importantly, と言わず～と言わず is highly formal and rarely appears in casual conversation.",
  "etymology": "と言わず (toiwaazu) combines the quotative particle と (to), the negative stem of the verb 言う (iu, to say), 言わ (iwa), and the literary form ず (zu) of the classical auxiliary verb ぬ (nu).  The ず form is a characteristic of older, more literary Japanese, contributing to the formality of this expression.  The absence of a more modern negative form like ない (nai) reinforces its literary character.",
