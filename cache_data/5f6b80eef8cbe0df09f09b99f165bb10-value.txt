    "etymology": "The phrase 「おまけに」 comes from the noun 「おまけ」, which means \"an extra, a bonus, or a freebie.\" 「に」 is a particle indicating direction or purpose. Together, they create a phrase that adds something extra to a situation, whether positive or negative.",
    "writeup": "「おまけに」 is a conjunction used to connect two clauses, A and B, indicating that B is added to A. It stems from the noun 「おまけ」 meaning \"discount\" or \"freebie.\" While 「おまけ」 itself is primarily used for positive additions, 「おまけに」 can convey \"in addition,\" \"on top of that,\" or \"what's more,\" regardless of whether the original topic is good or bad.\n\nHowever, A and B should align in tone; both should be either positive or negative. Being a combination of 「おまけ」 and 「に」, this phrase appears at the beginning of a new sentence or a second clause. It implies that A is sufficient on its own, and B adds 'icing on the cake' or 'insult to injury.'",
