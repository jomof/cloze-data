    "writeup": "「のに」 expresses the idea of **unexpectedness** or **contrast**.  It indicates that despite a certain situation or fact (clause A), the resulting outcome (clause B) is surprising or contrary to what one might expect. Think of it as saying, \"Even though A is the case, surprisingly, B happened/is happening/will happen.\"\n\nIt connects two clauses, where the first clause sets up an expectation that the second clause contradicts.  Remember that when connecting to a noun or な-adjective, you'll need to add 「な」 before 「のに」. So it becomes 「名詞なのに」 or 「な形容詞なのに」.\n\nYou might also hear 「だのに」, especially in certain dialects, but it's generally not considered standard Japanese.",
