  "etymology": "The etymology of ほとんど is somewhat debated.  The most accepted theory connects it to the now-archaic word 殆ど (ほとんと), meaning 'nearly' or 'almost'.  The modern usage retains the core meaning but has simplified the pronunciation and usage. The evolution reflects a broader tendency in Japanese towards phonetic simplification over time.",
  "writeup": "The adverb ほとんど (hotondo) is versatile and frequently used.  It translates as 'most,' 'almost all,' 'hardly any,' or 'few,' depending on context.  The key is understanding that ほとんど refers to a group or totality, not just individual items.  Think of it as \"almost the entire group.\" When used in negative sentences, it conveys \"hardly any\" or a near absence.  This is because the emphasis is on the near-lack of the described entity, not a small presence.  It can modify phrases or combine with の to refine its scope, providing greater specificity. The flexibility of ほとんど makes it a crucial tool in conveying nuanced amounts and quantities.",
