    "etymology": "「より」 means 'than' or 'from,' indicating a comparison point. 「のほうが」, with 「ほう」 meaning 'side' or 'direction,' implies a preference or a greater degree in one direction compared to the other. Combined, they create the structure for comparing two things and stating which is 'more' something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「より〜のほうが」 expresses that one thing is \"more\" something than another. Think of it as similar to 「たほうがいい」 or 「ないほうがいい」, but instead of suggesting what's better to do, it compares the degree of a quality. 「より」 translates to \"than\" or \"rather than.\"  When used with 「のほうが」, it indicates the item with the lesser extent of the quality.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「より」 always appears after the item with the *lower* extent of the adjective. For example, in 「AよりBのほうが大きい」, A is smaller than B.\n*   When 「より」 appears by itself, it might seem to have the opposite meaning. However, in those cases, 「のほうが」 is often implied but unstated. For example, 「これがより高い」 means \"This is more expensive (than other things).\"\n*   While 「の方が」 is common, 「を」 can sometimes replace 「が」, especially with expressions of desire like 「たい」 and 「ほしい」. 「が」 emphasizes the entire statement, while 「を」 emphasizes the item or action itself.",
