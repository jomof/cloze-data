  "writeup": "そばから, meaning \"as soon as,\" \"right after,\" or \"even if...still,\" is a fascinating grammatical construction.  It combines the noun 側 (そば, 'side') and the particle から ('from').  The nuance is crucial: it describes something happening immediately after another action, often implying an undesirable or frustrating consequence.  Think of it as 'from the very side of (A), (B) happens,' emphasizing the immediacy and often negative correlation between (A) and (B). While technically it can follow verbs in their dictionary or past-tense forms, the core meaning remains the same—the focus is on the sequential immediacy, regardless of the tense. However, it almost always implies a repeated pattern, not a one-time occurrence.  Mastering this subtle implication is key to using そばから naturally.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of そばから lies in its components.  そば (そば) comes from the noun 側 (そば, 'side'), referring to a position or aspect.  から (から) is a particle indicating origin or starting point, further reinforcing the idea of immediacy. The combination thus perfectly captures the 'as soon as' sense.",

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The formality of 「彼女は約束をするそばからすぐ約束を破る。」 stems from the structure of the sentence and the choice of vocabulary. There's nothing inherently gendered about this sentence."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼は注意する**そばから**失敗をするから、私のいうことは聞いていないんだろう。",
      "english": "I guess he doesn't listen to me because he makes mistakes as soon as I warn him.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The sentence 「彼は注意するそばから失敗をするから、私のいうことは聞いていないんだろう。」 is semi-formal due to the use of だろう.  It's a casual inference, not a strong assertion. The speaker's age and gender aren't particularly relevant."

      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "past tense",
      "nuance": "「パソコンを直したそばからまた壊れてしまうから困っている。」 is casual due to the use of the plain past tense and the sentence structure. Again, no gendered speech is used."

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The sentence 「あなたって人は、「やるな」と言ったそばからやるんだから。」 uses casual speech and the slightly condescending 「あなたって人」.  The use of ん, indicates informal speech, a common feature of female speech."

      "conjugation": "past tense",
      "nuance": "The intimate register in 「キスしたそばから、もう一回したいって言うの？」 is created through the directness and the use of simple vocabulary. The use of 「言うの？」 is a typically female way of expressing mild surprise.  The intimacy comes from the topic of kissing."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "会った**そばから**、あなたのことが好きになった。",
      "english": "I fell in love with you the moment I met you.",

      "setting": "first-date",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": "past tense",
      "nuance": "The formality in 「会ったそばから、あなたのことが好きになった。」 is created through the classic sentence structure.  There's nothing overtly gendered in the sentence structure itself, but in this context, it's a bolder statement for a man to make to a woman on a first date."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the negative consequence or frustrating aspect is often implied rather than explicitly stated.  The listener understands the implied meaning based on context and common sense.  This implicit nature is a key characteristic of the nuance of そばから."
