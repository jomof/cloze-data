  "writeup": "This grammar point, そうにない, translates to \"unlikely to\" or \"showing no signs of.\"  It's a useful expression for expressing a lack of expectation or indication of something happening.  Unlike そうもない, which implies a stronger sense of unlikelihood, そうにない suggests a less emphatic probability.  The structure attaches to the masu-stem of the verb, indicating the action's low probability.  The nuance shifts depending on context—it can convey a sense of pessimism, resignation, or even a subtle hint of disappointment.  While generally neutral in register, the overall tone is set by the surrounding sentence structure and vocabulary.",
  "etymology": "そうにない is built upon そう (seem, appear) which is used for speculation or indirect reporting, combined with the negative ない (not). The に particle indicates a direction or state,  linking the likelihood to the verb stem.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "雨は降り**そうにない**ね。",
      "english": "It doesn't look like it'll rain.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses ね, a sentence-final particle common in casual conversation, which also indicates the speaker's confidence in the statement.  The use of ね further softens the tone making it light and conversational."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼は来**そうにない**です。",
      "english": "He doesn't seem likely to come.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite です ending makes this appropriate for most situations where politeness is expected."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "試験に合格**できそうにない**と、彼は諦めかけていた。",
      "english": "He almost gave up when he thought he was unlikely to pass the exam.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "storytelling",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of  「できそうにない」with the potential verb form adds a layer of uncertainty and internal conflict to the character's feeling."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "このプロジェクトは成功**しそうにない**。",
      "english": "This project doesn't seem likely to succeed.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The straightforward nature of the sentence and the lack of sentence-final particles make it appropriate for professional contexts. The sentence is neutral in tone and simply states a fact."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ねえ、私と一緒に出かけ**そうにない**？",
      "english": "Hey, aren't you going to go out with me?",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of ねえ is a typical female way of starting a flirty sentence. The question is phrased in a suggestive way, implying a romantic interest, and the use of 「そうにない」is playful, adding a hint of challenge."

    {
      "japanese": "あなたと話す**機会がなさそうにな**い。",
      "english": "It seems that we won't have the chance to talk again.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses a more formal tone but still implies a personal connection, using the expression in a melancholic way. This creates a sense of missed opportunity and longing which is appropriate for a first-date scenario where the relationship might not progress."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "今度のプロジェクトは、予算が足り**そうにない**から、計画を見直す必要があるでしょう。",
      "english": "The next project is unlikely to have enough budget, thus a plan review is necessary.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses a formal tone appropriate for a professional setting. 「でしょう」is a formal sentence ending. The sentence clearly states a concern and offers a solution."

  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the degree of unlikelihood you want to convey.  Use そうもない for strong improbability, っこない for emphatic impossibility, and そうにない for a more moderate expression of uncertainty.  こと に should be used when emphasizing the subject and not focusing on likelihood."
