  "writeup": "The particle つつ (tsutsu) combined with も (mo) creates a nuanced expression conveying the simultaneous occurrence of two actions or states, often contrasting or unexpected.  It's frequently translated as 'even while...,' 'even though...,' 'despite...,' or 'although...'.  The first clause, modified by つつ (tsutsu), describes an ongoing action or state, while the second clause presents a seemingly contradictory or additional action or state.  Crucially, つつ (tsutsu) typically follows the masu-stem of a verb, most effectively when the first clause involves a mental or perceptual process like 'thinking,' 'knowing,' 'seeing,' or 'hearing', making it a powerful tool for describing internal conflicts or subtle contrasts.  Think of it as a more formal and literary cousin of ながら (nagara).  While similar in function to ながら (nagara), which can follow various word types, つつ (tsutsu) is exclusively used with verbs.",
  "etymology": "つつ (tsutsu) originates from the verb つつぐ (tsutsugu), meaning 'to continue' or 'to follow consecutively'. The addition of も (mo) enhances the 'even' or 'despite' nuance by adding emphasis and contradiction. This combination reflects a subtle evolution of the language, showcasing the layering of particles to express complex ideas.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "Choosing between these similar particles depends heavily on the context and the desired level of formality and emotional tone.  つつも (tsutsu mo) is most effective when describing simultaneous actions that present a subtle contrast or internal conflict, while the others allow for broader applications. Consider the speaker's intent, the relationship between the speaker and listener, and the overall context when selecting the most appropriate particle."
