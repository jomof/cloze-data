It often takes the form of a rhetorical question, asserting the speaker's opinion. The expression can be translated as \"If it isn't (A), then what is it?\" or \"What else could it be if not (A)?\"\n\n*   It is often used to emphasize a point or express a strong opinion.\n*   It can be followed by the sentence-ending particle 「か」 for added emphasis. This does not change the core meaning.",
