  "writeup": "This grammar point, \"ようが～まいが,\" translates to \"even if...; no matter what...; whether or not...\" and adds a strong emphatic nuance.  It's constructed by combining the volitional forms of a verb (positive: -yō, negative: -mai) with the particle が.  The structure literally implies: 'Whether it is (positive volitional) or whether it is not (negative volitional), the result will be (B).' This conveys a resolute attitude, suggesting the outcome remains unchanged regardless of the preceding condition. While typically used with verbs, the principle extends to other sentence structures, though with nuances.  For example, with adjectives, you might see antonyms paired with the positive volitional, as the negative volitional doesn't directly combine with them.  This grammar pattern is rarely used in casual conversation, and demonstrates a strong sense of determination or a statement of fact impervious to external influences.  Think of it as a very emphatic way of saying that something is true regardless of a certain factor.",
  "etymology": "The structure's foundation lies in the volitional forms -yō (よう) and -mai (まい).  -yō derives from the verb する (to do), expressing intention or will, while -mai, from the verb まう (an archaic form of 来る [kuru] - to come), denotes negation of volition.  The particle が (ga) marks the subject, highlighting the unimportance of the preceding condition.",
