    "etymology": "The particle 「とか」 is a combination of 「と」, the quote marker, and 「か」, which indicates uncertainty. This combination creates a sense of reporting something heard but without full confidence or confirmation.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「とか」 combines 「と」 (a quotative particle) and 「か」 (a particle indicating uncertainty). Thus, 「とか」 conveys that the speaker heard something but isn't entirely sure if it's true or accurate. It's similar to saying \"I heard something like...\" or \"...or something\" in English. It can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns.\n\nPay close attention to the context. 「とか」 can also list items, actions, or states, meaning \"and\" or \"or.\" Although these usages have overlap in meaning, it is important to understand which version is being used.",
