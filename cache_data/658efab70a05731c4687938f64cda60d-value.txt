    "etymology": "The word 「たちまち」 originally comes from the kanji structure 「忽ち」, with the kanji itself meaning 'without thought'. This nuance is kept with 「たちまち」, as all actions associated with the word indicate a lack of planning or thought before happening. Despite this, the kanji itself is rarely used in modern writing.",
    "writeup": "「たちまち」 is an adverb that conveys the feeling of something happening suddenly or in a flash. The primary nuance is that it indicates something happened spontaneously, without being controlled. Often, 「たちまち」 indicates something entering a new, ongoing state or being completed. It frequently appears directly before the verb phrase it describes as being the new state.\n\nFun fact: As mentioned in etymology, 「たちまち」 originally comes from 「忽ち」, meaning \"without thought,\" which informs its sense of spontaneity. Despite this origin, the kanji form is rarely used today.",
