    "etymology": "The grammar point 「まくる」 comes from the verb 「捲る（まくる）」 which means \"to roll up,\" \"to turn over,\" or \"to wind.\"  The image is that of something being done repeatedly, turning it over and over again. You can think of it like rolling out a long scroll or unspooling a thread, implying continuous action.",
    "writeup": "「まくる」 is a verb attached to the conjunctive form (ます-stem) of another verb to express that the action is done repeatedly, excessively, or with great enthusiasm.  Think of it as doing something **like crazy**, **nonstop**, or **with abandon**.  It conveys the idea of doing something over and over, \"rolling\" through the action.  So, if you want to say you did nothing but something, or did something constantly, 「まくる」 is a great choice.  It can be used in both positive and negative situations.  A key nuance of 「まくる」 is that it often implies the action is being done without much thought for the consequences or in a somewhat reckless manner. **Important Consideration**: The verb it attaches to must be volitional – an action the subject has control over.",
