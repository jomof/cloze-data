    "etymology": "This grammar point is built from the negative form of a verb (ない), followed by わけ (reason), に (particle), は (topic marker), いかない (cannot go/do). Literally, it means \"there's no reason why you can't do it\" or \"it cannot be that you don't do it.\"",
    "writeup": "ないわけにはいかない is an extension of 訳にはいかない, meaning \"can't afford to do (A)\" or \"impossible to do (A).\" Adding ない creates a double negative, often translated as \"can't not (A)\" or \"no way to avoid (A).\"  The literal meaning is \"there's no reason that (A) can't be done,\" implying a sense of obligation or circumstance. Compared to similar structures like なければならない and ないといけない, ないわけにはいかない emphasizes the unavoidable circumstances compelling the action.",
