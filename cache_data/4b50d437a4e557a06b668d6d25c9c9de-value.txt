  "pronunciation": {
    "katakana": "きまりない・きまる",
    "romaji": "kimari nai・kimaru"
  },
  "etymology": "This grammar point stems from the verb 極まる (kimaru), meaning 'to reach the extreme,' 'to be at the limit.'  The form 極まりない (kimari nai) literally means 'there is no limit to...' or 'without limit.' The usage of ない doesn't represent a simple negation, but rather emphasizes the boundless nature of the described quality.",
  "writeup": "The expressions 極まりない (kimari nai) and 極まる (kimaru) convey the idea of something being 'extreme' or 'extremely' something.  While both express intensity, there's a subtle difference.  **極まりない** is more frequently used and often follows words describing negative states or emotions. It literally means \"there's no limit to...\"  **極まる**, on the other hand, usually follows な-adjectives.  Important considerations: 極まりない is not the negative of 極まる; it's a different construction entirely. The actual negative form is 極まらない (kimaranai), meaning 'does not reach the extreme.'  The choice between these two forms depends on the context and the preceding word.  While they both indicate an extreme degree, the nuanced difference lies in how that extremity is expressed – as a limitless state (極まりない) or as a state that has reached its limit (極まる).",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「心極まる」is a more poetic way to express profound emotion, common in intimate settings between a male and female. The choice of the simpler form 極まる over 極まりない reflects a focus on the positive impact of kindness, rather than simply stating an extreme degree."

    {
      "japanese": "あの人、かっこよすぎ**極まりない**でしょ？",
      "english": "That guy, he's extremely handsome, right?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「でしょ？」at the end adds a casual and friendly tone appropriate for a conversation between young women. The slight teasing tone is common in flirty contexts among young females. The use of 「かっこよすぎ」already implies an excessive degree of handsomeness, and the addition of 「極まりない」further emphasizes this, fitting the suggestive context."

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The casual register reflects the friendly interaction between an older and younger person. The simplicity of 「おいし極まりない」 directly conveys a strong positive feeling about the food, suitable for everyday conversation. The older speaker's choice to use the casual register may indicate a close and comfortable relationship with the younger listener."

      "term": "の極み",
      "meaning": "Ultimate, Extreme, Utter, Epitome, Peak",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike 極まりない/極まる, which emphasizes the intensity of a quality, の極み suggests the ultimate, perfect example of that quality.  It implies a more absolute and definitive state."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that の極み implies a perfected or ultimate state, whereas 極まりない/極まる highlights the intensity or excessiveness of a quality.  Context will usually make the distinction clear; if unsure, err on the side of  極まりない for emphasizing an excessive degree."
