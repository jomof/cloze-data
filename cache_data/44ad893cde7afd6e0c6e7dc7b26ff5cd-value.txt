  "writeup": "The sentence-ending particle \"な\" (na) is a powerful tool for expressing prohibition in Japanese.  It carries a strong, almost commanding tone, unlike polite requests.  It's generally attached to the dictionary form of a verb, creating a forceful instruction to *not* perform the action. While versatile, \"な\" is generally considered less formal than other ways to express negation, making it suitable for casual conversations among peers or close relationships.  It's less common in formal settings like business or academic discussions.  Understanding its forceful nature is key to using it effectively and avoiding miscommunication.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of \"な\" is complex and not definitively traced to a single origin.  It's considered a type of emphatic particle, evolving from earlier forms which expressed negation or emphasis.  Its current usage is likely a result of long-term linguistic evolution rather than a direct descendant of a single ancient word.",

      "japanese": "行くな。",
      "english": "Don't go!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "commanding",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The bluntness of 「行くな」 (ikanu) makes it suitable for a commanding tone.  The lack of politeness markers makes it suitable for close relationships, but inappropriate for formal settings."

      "japanese": "泣くなよ。",
      "english": "Don't cry, now.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "sympathetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Adding 「よ」 (yo) softens the harshness of 「泣くな」(nakuna) slightly, making it more suitable for comforting someone.  It's still casual but shows a touch of empathy."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ここで騒ぐな！",
      "english": "Don't make a racket here!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "commanding",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The exclamation mark in 「ここで騒ぐな！」 (koko de sawagu na!) adds further emphasis, suitable for expressing strong disapproval.  The lack of politeness is more appropriate among close friends than in a formal setting. "
    },
    {
      "japanese": "そんなこと言うな！",
      "english": "Don't say such things!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "「そんなこと言うな！」 (sonna koto iu na!) carries a strong sense of disapproval.  The casual register makes it suitable for reprimanding a friend, but would be inappropriate for a superior."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "私を無視するな！",
      "english": "Don't ignore me!",
      "register": "casual",

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "A female speaker using 「私を無視するな！」 (watashi o mushi suru na!) to a male listener adds a playful tone of flirtatious annoyance. The directness is acceptable between close acquaintances. The absence of honorifics contributes to this."

      "japanese": "私と結婚しないな！",
      "english": "Don't marry me!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "「私と結婚しないな！」 (watashi to kekkon shinai na!) is humorous because it twists the particle 'na' to express a playful protest. This is entirely casual. This would be unthinkable in a formal setting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "その服を着ないでくれ。",
      "english": "Please don't wear that outfit.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "「ないでくれ」(naide kure) is a softer way to say don't do it; more polite than 'na'.  This level of politeness makes it suitable for a first encounter or early dating stages to avoid offense, unlike the more blunt \"na\"."
    }

  "post_example_writeup": "The examples demonstrate the range of \"na\"'s usage, from strong commands to more nuanced expressions.  Context is crucial; it's important to consider your relationship with the listener when using this particle.",
