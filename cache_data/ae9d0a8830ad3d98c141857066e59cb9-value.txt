  "writeup": "では and じゃあ are both abbreviations of それでは, and used as conjunctions in Japanese.  This structure might be considered a combination of それ (that), the case marking particle で, and the binding (adverbial) particle は, but it's commonly treated as a single word. それでは has two primary functions. It can continue a topic, showing that '(B) is a result of (A)'. Or, it can change the conversation topic, showing that '(A) is at a good point to become (B)'.  In either case, it can be translated as 'and with that'. 'If so', 'well then', and 'in that case' are also common translations. The translation 'in that case' is most commonly used when someone is making an assumption/drawing a conclusion about something someone else just said.  Fun Fact: それでは, では, and じゃあ are also frequently used as a polite way to say 'goodbye'. In these situations, it's similar to 'well…. I best be off' in English.",
  "etymology": "The phrase それでは (soredewa) is a combination of three elements: それ (sore, \"that\"), で (de, a particle indicating a means or reason), and は (wa, a topic-marking particle).  The combination implies a logical progression or consequence based on a previously mentioned fact or idea.  The shorter forms では (dewa) and じゃあ (jaa) are contractions of それでは, emphasizing informality and conciseness.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While さ and さて can be used similarly to では/それでは/じゃあ to start a new thought, they lack the consequential nuance of  では/それでは/じゃあ.  Pay close attention to the context; if you're signaling a logical progression based on what has been said, use では/それでは/じゃあ. If you need a more general filler, consider さ, or a more thoughtful pause, consider さて."
