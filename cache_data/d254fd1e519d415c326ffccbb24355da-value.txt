    "etymology": "The grammar point 「つつ」 is derived from the verb 「つむ」 (tsumu), which means \"to spin\" or \"to weave.\" The idea is that you are weaving two actions together simultaneously. It's also related to the verb 「続ける」 (tsuzukeru), meaning \"to continue,\" suggesting an ongoing state or action.",
    "writeup": "「つつ」 is a formal grammar structure used to indicate two actions happening simultaneously. It's often translated as \"while\" or \"and.\" This is more frequently found in writing than in speech. Unlike 「ながら」, 「つつ」 is often used when the first action is an ongoing state rather than a physical action involving movement. The second action can be a physical movement or an ongoing state. It adds a sense of simultaneity and can imply a deeper connection between the two actions. Because it is more formal, it can come off as stiff in casual conversation.",
