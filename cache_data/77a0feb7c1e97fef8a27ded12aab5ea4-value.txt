  "writeup": "The particle に, combined with the て-form of the verb 渡る (wataru, \"to cross\"), creates the expression にわたって.  This phrase indicates a duration or extent across a period of time or a spatial range. It's often translated as \"across,\" \"throughout,\" \"extending over,\" or \"over a period of.\"  The nuance emphasizes the entirety of the period or range being encompassed.  For example,  \"一年にわたって\" (ichi-nen ni watatte) suggests the entire year, not just parts of it. This construction is typically formal and frequently seen in news reports and official documents.  Important Considerations:  Because 渡る implies a crossing, the span or range must be clearly defined.  Using にわたって with an undefined period would sound unnatural.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's core, 渡る (wataru), literally means \"to cross.\"  Therefore, にわたって inherently carries the sense of something spanning or traversing a certain duration or distance. The て-form shows continuous action across the specified period.",
