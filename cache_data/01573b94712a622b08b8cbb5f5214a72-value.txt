    "writeup": "かなり is an adverb that conveys a **substantial** or **noticeable** degree of something.  It translates to English words like \"quite,\" \"fairly,\" \"considerably,\" or \"pretty.\"  It typically appears directly before the word or phrase it modifies.  When modifying a noun, the particle の is inserted between かなり and the noun (かなりの). \n\n**Etymology**: Interestingly, かなり originated from the kanji 可也 and, more recently, 可成. Both of these older forms imply something has reached a point where it's **undeniable**. The kanji 也 in 可也 is an older form meaning \"to become.\" This historical nuance suggests that when using かなり, you're highlighting that something has reached a degree that cannot be ignored. This underlying sense can apply to both positive and negative situations.",
