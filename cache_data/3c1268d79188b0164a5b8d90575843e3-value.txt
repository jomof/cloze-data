  "etymology": "欲しい (hoshii) is an i-adjective meaning 'desirable' or 'wanted'.  The structure 'Noun が ほしい' directly derives from the adjectival nature of ほしい, where the が particle marks the thing that is desired.",
  "writeup": "The expression がほしい is used to express a desire for a thing.  It's a straightforward way to say \"I want (something)\" or \"I need (something)\".  The particle が marks the object of desire.  This construction is fundamental and commonly used across various registers of Japanese.  Note that this construction is used specifically for *things*, not actions. To express a desire to *do* something, you'll use the たい form. However, ほしい can be used with verbs through the て form to express wanting someone else to perform an action (see the てほしい lesson).",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to avoiding confusion lies in identifying the type of desire being expressed.  Is it a desire for a thing (がほしい)?  A desire to perform an action (たい)?  A desire for someone else to perform an action (てほしい)?  The nuance of each expression is crucial for accurate and natural communication. Carefully consider the subject, the object, and the nature of the desire before choosing the most appropriate expression."
