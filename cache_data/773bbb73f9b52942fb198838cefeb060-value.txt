  "writeup": "The expression \"次第だ・次第で\" (shidai da/de) is a nuanced grammatical structure in Japanese, indicating dependence or consequence based on a preceding condition.  It literally translates to 'depending on...' or 'according to...' but carries a subtle implication of inevitability or a direct causal link.  The particle \"だ\" (da) is used for declarative sentences, while \"で\" (de) is often used to introduce a consequential clause.  Understanding this subtle difference is key to mastering the phrase's application.  The word \"次第\" (shidai) itself means 'sequence,' 'turn,' or 'order,' thus highlighting the sequential nature of the relationship expressed.  It's important to note the preceding element sets the condition, while the following element describes the resulting consequence. Mastering this nuanced expression adds considerable depth and sophistication to your Japanese communication.",
  "etymology": "The term \"次第\" (shidai) originates from the combination of \"次\" (ji, meaning next or following) and \"第\" (dai, meaning order or sequence).  This etymology reinforces the sequential nature inherent in the grammatical construction, emphasizing that one event or outcome follows upon another depending on the antecedent conditions.",
