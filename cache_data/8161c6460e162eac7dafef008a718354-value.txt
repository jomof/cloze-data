    "etymology": "「につき」 comes from 「に」 (a particle indicating cause, reason, or rate) and the conjunctive form (連用形) of the verb 「就く」 (つく, tsuku), meaning \"to take up,\" \"to assume,\" or \"to be affixed to.\" In this grammar point, it retains the sense of something being directly linked or related to something else.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「につき」 is derived from 「に」 and the verb 「就く」 (tsuku). While rarely written in kanji, it is a formal expression primarily used in official documents, announcements, and notifications. It conveys meanings such as \"due to,\" \"on account of,\" \"per,\" or \"for each.\" The underlying sense is that B is directly linked to A, whether as a cause, reason, or proportional relationship. It connects nouns directly to clauses explaining the result or reason.",
