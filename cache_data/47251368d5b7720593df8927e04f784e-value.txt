  "writeup": "The expression \"折には\" (oriniha) is a nuanced and formal way to express 'when' or 'on the occasion of' in Japanese.  It uses the noun 折 (ori), meaning 'fold' or 'pleat,' in an adverbial sense, modified by the particle に (ni). This particle indicates a time or occasion, suggesting an opportune moment for something to happen.  Think of it as a refined alternative to 時に (toki ni), but with a subtle difference in formality and connotation.  It's frequently used to describe events that occur repeatedly or at opportune moments rather than one-time occurrences. While often translated as 'when the chance arises,' or 'on the occasion of,' the true meaning is richer.  It implies a sense of timing and appropriateness, often suggesting a sense of 'taking advantage of an opportunity'.  Its formal register makes it suitable for business correspondence, speeches, or formal announcements.  It's less common in casual conversation.  Importantly, note that the は (wa) particle in \"折には\" is often omitted, resulting in the simpler form \"折に\".  This nuance is subtle, but mastering it will add sophistication to your Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of \"折には\" lies in the word 折 (ori), which literally means 'fold' or 'pleat.'  Its usage here is metaphorical;  the 'fold' represents a point in time or a turning point, an opportune moment that presents itself like a carefully folded piece of cloth.",
