    "etymology": "The grammar point 「のももっともだ」 is composed of several elements: 「の」, a nominalizer turning a phrase into a noun; 「も」, a particle indicating 'also' or 'even'; and 「もっとも」, a な-adjective meaning 'reasonable' or 'plausible'. 「だ」 is the auxiliary verb 'to be'. Thus, the expression literally means 'it is reasonable that...'",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「のももっともだ」 combines 「の」, 「も」, the *na*-adjective 「もっとも」 (meaning \"reasonable\" or \"plausible\"), and the auxiliary verb 「だ」. It indicates that something is understandable or reasonable. Think of it as affirming the logic behind a situation, whether or not you personally agree with it.\n\n*   It translates to \"it's only natural that...\", \"no wonder...\", \"have good reason to...\", or \"may well...\"\n*   It's used with verbs, *i*-adjectives, *na*-adjectives, and nouns. When used with nouns, 「の」 is dropped.\n*   It often appears with explanatory phrases like 「から」 or 「ので」.",
