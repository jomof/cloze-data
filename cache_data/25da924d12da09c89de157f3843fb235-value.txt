    "etymology": "「契機 (けいき)」 means 'opportunity' or 'trigger'. The addition of 「を」 marks the noun as the direct object, and 「に」 indicates a point in time or a reason, thus forming a structure indicating that something happens *as a result of* or *with* that opportunity/trigger.",
    "writeup": "「を契機に」 is a formal grammar pattern indicating that a particular event or situation becomes the **decisive trigger** or **opportunity** for a subsequent action or change. It conveys the sense that the latter event wouldn't have occurred, or would have been significantly delayed, without the former.  While the trigger can be positive or negative, it's generally something significant or momentous, marking a turning point. It's often translated as \"taking the opportunity of,\" \"as a result of,\" or \"triggered by.\"\n\nThis pattern follows a noun, or a verb nominalized with 「の」 or 「こと」.  Similar expressions like 「をきっかけに」, 「を機に」, 「を機として」, 「にして」, or 「として」 can sometimes be used as replacements, but 「を契機に」 emphasizes a more **critical juncture** or **important turning point** compared to 「をきっかけに」, which can describe more casual triggers.  Therefore, using 「を契機に」 for minor, everyday triggers can sound quite unnatural.",

If the focus is on exploiting a situation, 「をいいことに」 is appropriate. If it's a general trigger without emphasis on a major turning point, 「きっかけ」 works well. If the events happen together or one naturally follows the other, use 「に伴って」.  Use 「を契機に」 when you want to emphasize that the first event was a crucial turning point or decisive trigger for the subsequent event."
