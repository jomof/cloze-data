  "writeup": "The conjunction しかしながら, pronounced \"shikashi nagara\", literally means \"however, while.\"  It's a more formal and emphatic version of しかし (shikashi), adding a nuance of contrast or unexpectedness.  Think of it as a stronger, more literary 'however' or 'nevertheless.'  It's commonly used to introduce a contrasting statement after a previous point has been made. While しかし can be used in various contexts, しかしながら generally appears at the beginning of a new sentence, creating a more sophisticated and deliberate shift in thought.  Its usage is primarily restricted to formal settings like written documents or formal speeches.",
  "etymology": "しかしながら is a combination of しかし (shikashi, however) and ながら (nagara, while, although).  The addition of ながら intensifies the contrastive meaning, elevating the expression to a more formal and literary register.  The original meaning of ながら, suggesting simultaneous actions, adds a layer of complexity, making the contrast more nuanced.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses standard Japanese, with 「とても努力家です」 showing a positive trait and 「あまり芳しくありませんでした」 offering a contrasting negative outcome.
