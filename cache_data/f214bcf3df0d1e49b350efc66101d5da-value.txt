    "etymology": "The word 「あまり」 comes from the verb 「余る(あまる)」, meaning \"to remain\" or \"to be in excess.\" Thus, 「あまり〜ない」 literally means \"not in excess,\" implying \"not very\" or \"not much.\"",
    "writeup": "「あまり」 is a flexible word that, when paired with the 「ない」 form of a verb or adjective, expresses that something is \"not very (A)\" or \"hardly (A).\" Place 「あまり」 directly before the 「ない」 form. While often translated as \"not very,\" the literal sense is closer to \"not excessively.\" The nuance changes based on whether the sentence itself is positive (does not use 「ない」) or negative (uses 「ない」). Note that あんまり is the casual form of あまり.",
