    "etymology": "The suffix 「ら」 originates from the kanji 「等」, which means 'etcetera' or 'and so forth.' This is why 「ら」 implies a sense of 'more than one'.",
    "writeup": "「ら」 is a suffix attached to pronouns to indicate plurality, similar to \"we,\" \"them,\" or \"these.\" It comes from the kanji 「等」, suggesting '(A) etc.' or '(A) and so on'. While it implies 'more than one,' it can sometimes sound dismissive, so it's often considered rude, especially when referring to people. In most cases, using 「達」 is a safer and more polite way to indicate plurality for people.",
