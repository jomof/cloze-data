    "etymology": "The structure combines the conditional/temporal particle 「たら」 with 「最後」 (saigo), meaning \"end\" or \"last.\" Thus, 「たら最後」 literally means \"if/when... then the end/last result is...\", implying an irreversible consequence.",
    "writeup": "「たら最後」 expresses the idea that once something happens, a negative or undesirable result is inevitable. It's similar to saying \"once (A), definitely (B)\", where (B) is always a negative consequence that is thought to occur once (A) happens. The expressions may be translated as \"once (A), (B)\", \"now that (A), (B)\", or \"as soon as (A), (B)\". The phrase 「最後」 emphasizes that the following result is the \"final state.\" Caution: Occasionally, the (B) phrase will be omitted from these sentences when the negative result is obvious.",
