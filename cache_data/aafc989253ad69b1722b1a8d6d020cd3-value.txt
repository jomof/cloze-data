    "etymology": "「できる」 itself means \"to be made\" or \"to be possible\". The particles で and から indicate the material from which something is made, with で suggesting the material is recognizable in the final product and から suggesting it has been transformed.",
    "writeup": "「でできる」 or 「からできる」 are two structures that share similar meanings: \"(B) was made from/out of (A)\". These constructions highlight the 'ingredients' or 'materials' something is/was made from. Let's consider some examples. 「から」 and 「で」 are both case-marking particles in this grammar point, and while they express much the same thing when translated into English, there is a slight nuance. \n\n「から」 literally means \"prepared from\", and it's often used when the material isn't obvious at first glance. It may also focus on the ingredients/materials before any alteration. 「で」 literally means \"prepared with\" and is more frequent when the materials are more obvious. \n\nDespite this, recent generations use 「で」 in most situations, regardless of whether the material is visible at first glance or not. As a result, 「でできる」 and 「からできる」 are almost indistinguishable in modern Japanese.\n\nThere is also a small nuance difference between 「できる」 and 「できている」 when used as part of this construction. 「できる」 is usually used when talking about something broadly: \"everything in category (B) is made from (A)\", while 「できている」 is more frequent when examining a specific item: \"this particular (B) is made from (A)\". Like the difference between 「で」 and 「から」, they are largely interchangeable.",
