    "writeup": "「てごらん」 is a Japanese expression used to suggest or advise someone to try doing something. While often translated as \"please try to (A),\" where (A) is the verb connected to 「ごらん」 using the 「て」 form, the literal meaning of 「覧」 is \"to look\" or \"to peruse.\" Therefore, 「てごらん」 carries a nuance similar to 「てみる」 (\"to try\"), but with an added emphasis of \"try as you like, when it suits you.\" Because ご覧 is honorific, it cannot refer to one's own actions. It can only make suggestions to others. Sometimes you will see 「ごらんなさい」, which is slightly stronger and feels like a light command. Because of this, 「ごらんなさい」 is often used by superiors or elders when requesting that a subordinate or younger person try something.",
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てごらん」 is derived from the te-form of a verb plus the verb 「ご覧 (goran)」, which is the honorific form of 「見る (miru)」 meaning \"to see\" or \"to look.\" The combination creates a polite suggestion to try 'looking' at an action, implying 'try doing'.",
