  "writeup": "に比べて is a set expression used for comparisons in Japanese.  It's straightforwardly translated as \"(A) compared to (B)\" or \"when comparing (A) to (B)\".  The verb 比べる (kuraberu) means \"to compare\" or \"to contrast.\"  に比べて follows a noun (A), setting the stage for the comparison detailed in the following clause (B).  Sometimes, と (to) replaces に (ni); both are largely interchangeable.  However, に emphasizes the differences or changes between similar aspects of A and B, while と tends to contrast A and B's individual characteristics.  The conjugation of 比べる isn't crucial; the nuance of \"if\" or \"when\" is what's important. Therefore, に比べたら (kurabetara), に比べれば (kurabereba), and に比べると (kuraberuto) are all valid.",
  "etymology": "The particle に (ni) indicates the standard comparative marker for comparing two objects.  比べて (kurabete) is the te-form of the verb 比べる (kuraberu), meaning to compare. The combination directly implies comparison of the prior element with what follows.",
