    "writeup": "The expression 「に気をつける」 is another common collocation based on 「気」, meaning \"attention\" or \"focus\". It combines the noun 「気」 with the particle 「を」 and the verb 「付ける」, which means \"to adhere\" or \"to attach\".\n\n「に気をつける」 primarily follows a noun marked by 「に」. This indicates that the speaker is \"adhering\" their attention to that noun. This translates to \"to pay attention to (A)\", \"to be careful of (A)\", or \"to watch out for (A)\". This grammar pattern is used after nouns or noun-like phrases, indicating what one is being warned about or what the speaker is being cautious of.\n\nOften, 「気をつける」 is used to warn about possible errors or mistakes. Because of this, it frequently follows negative verbs in the form 「ないように」, emphasizing that something should be done in a way that avoids (A).",
