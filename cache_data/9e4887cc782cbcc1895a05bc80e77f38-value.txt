    "writeup": "**少ない (sukunai)** means \"few\", \"a small number of\", or \"little\". It is an い-adjective. Because it is an い-adjective, it conjugates like other い-adjectives. **Important consideration**: 少ない is not typically used directly before a noun unless in a relative clause. Instead, consider using phrases like 「～は少ないです」or 「～が少ないです」.",
