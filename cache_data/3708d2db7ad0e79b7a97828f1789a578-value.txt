    "etymology": "The particle 「か」 originally functioned as a question marker. Its use as 'or' stems from presenting options as alternatives within a question. Imagine asking, 「これですか、それですか」 (Is it this, or is it that?), where 「か」 marks each option as a potential answer.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「か」, when used to mean \"or,\" presents a choice between two or more options. It essentially functions as a question marker that implies alternatives. While directly translating to 'or' is accurate, remember that 「か」 retains its fundamental role of indicating possibilities, similar to a question mark or a rising tone in speech. For instance, 「紅茶**か**コーヒー」 (tea or coffee?) implies asking which one is preferred. You can use it with almost any word or phrase. Avoid using 「です」 or 「ます」 because that changes the nuance from offering choices to asking a formal question.",
