        "Part of Speech": "Adverb (そもそも); Pre-noun adjectival (連体詞) (そもそもの)",
        "Usage": "Used to introduce a fundamental point, often implying a question or disagreement with something that has been said or done.  「そもそも」can stand alone as an adverb; 「そもそもの」 modifies a noun."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「そもそも」 likely originated from a combination of 「そも」, an old word meaning 'in the first place,' and 「も」, an emphasizing particle. The addition of 「の」 creates a pre-noun adjectival form, indicating origin or essence.",
    "writeup": "「そもそも」 and 「そもそもの」 are used to express a speaker's questioning or assertion about a fundamental aspect of a situation. 「そもそも」 functions as an adverb, setting the stage for a statement that challenges a prior assumption or action. It conveys a sense of \"in the first place\" or \"to begin with.\" When used in this way, it often introduces a reason why something is not possible, not right, or not understandable.\n\n「そもそもの」, on the other hand, acts as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞, *rentaishi*), directly modifying a noun to indicate its origin or fundamental nature. It emphasizes the original or essential quality of the noun it modifies.  For example, 「そもそもの原因」 (the original cause).\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   「そもそも」 often implies a sense of disagreement or questioning.\n*   「そもそもの」 is used to specify the original or fundamental aspect of something.",
