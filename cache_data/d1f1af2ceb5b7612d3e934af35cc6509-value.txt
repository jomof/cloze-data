  "formation": {
    "Verb (てform) + ごらん": "Suggests trying something, often in a gentle or encouraging manner."
  },
  "etymology": "ごらん (goran) comes from the verb 見る (miru, to see) and is in the polite, imperative form.  The て-form preceding it adds flexibility, making the suggestion more nuanced than a direct command.",
  "writeup": "てごらん (te goran) is a polite and encouraging way to suggest someone try something.  It's often translated as \"Please try...\" or \"Please look...,\" but its nuance is more akin to a gentle suggestion rather than a direct order.  It's formed by attaching ごらん to the te-form of a verb.  Think of it as a softer, more inviting version of なさい (nasai), which is a more direct command.  Because ごらん is honorific, it's crucial to remember that this phrase is always used to invite *others* to try something; you wouldn't use it to talk about your own actions.  While similar to てみる (te miru, to try), てごらん carries a subtle suggestion of \"try it at your leisure.\"  Pairing it with なさい (goran nasai) creates a slightly stronger suggestion, bordering on a gentle command, typically used by older speakers to younger ones or superiors to subordinates.",
