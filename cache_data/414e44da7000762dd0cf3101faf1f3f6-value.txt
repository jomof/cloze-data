    "etymology": "「よう」 is derived from 「様」 (さま), meaning way, manner, or method. When combined with 「がない」 or 「もない」, it creates a sense that there is no means or method to perform a certain action.",
    "writeup": "「ようがない」 or 「ようもない」 is used to emphasize that there is no 'method' or 'manner' to do something. It translates to 'there is no way to (A)' or 'it's impossible to (A)'. This phrase attaches to the ます-stem of verbs.\n\n「ようがない」 often highlights that the action is impossible, even if the speaker desires to do it.\n\n**Important Consideration:** Be careful not to confuse this with the auxiliary verb 「よう」 used to form the volitional form of verbs (e.g., 「する」 becomes 「しよう」). The kanji 様 (さま) is often written in hiragana, so pay close attention to the context.",
