  "etymology": "This phrase is a beautiful example of classical Japanese grammar.  It combines the adverbial particle を (wo), the noun 物 (mono, 'thing'), the particle とも (tomo, 'even as'), and the negative form of する (suru, 'to do'), paired with the classical auxiliary verb ず (zu), resulting in せず (sezu, 'without doing'). The elegant construction evokes a sense of resolute action despite adversity. The use of  ず (zu) instead of ない (nai) adds a layer of formality and emphasizes the unwavering nature of the action.",
  "writeup": "The grammar point をものともせず (wo mono tomo sezu) translates as \"making nothing of,\" \"ignoring,\" \"in defiance of,\" \"regardless of,\" or \"disregarding.\"  It's a nuanced expression often used to describe someone overcoming a significant obstacle or challenge with unwavering determination.  The structure is quite formal, reflecting its literary origins.  **Crucially**, it's used after a noun phrase representing the obstacle being overcome.  The sentence implies a powerful action taken *despite* the challenge presented. It's less about simply ignoring something inconsequential and more about actively pushing through significant adversity.  This phrase is generally used to praise someone's fortitude in the face of a difficult situation; it's not usually used to describe one's own actions.  It carries a strong, almost heroic connotation.",
