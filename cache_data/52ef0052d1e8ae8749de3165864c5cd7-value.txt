    "etymology": "The verb 「込む」 originally means \"to be crowded\" or \"to pack into\". It extends to mean doing something thoroughly or deeply because it evokes the image of being completely immersed or 'packed into' an action or state.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「込む」, meaning \"to jam into,\" often functions as a suffix to other verbs, adding nuances of thoroughness, depth, or persistence. It signifies: \n\n*   Entering completely into an action.\n*   Engaging in an action until successful.\n*   Entering a state from which escape is difficult.\n\nWhile 「込む」 can have multiple meanings, it generally implies 'jamming' something into an action. It is attached to the conjunctive form (ます stem) of other verbs, thus creating new verb forms that describe the intensity or continuation of the original verb. For example, 「話し込む」means “to become engrossed in conversation.”",
