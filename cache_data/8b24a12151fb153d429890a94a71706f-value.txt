    "writeup": "The adverb **つい** typically appears at the beginning of a sentence and conveys a sense of doing something unintentionally, unconsciously, absentmindedly, or against one's better judgment. It often pairs with the **てしまう** structure to emphasize the unintentional nature of the action.  Although \"accidentally\" is the most common translation of つい, it can express three distinct nuances:\n\n*   **はからず (hakarazu):**  Something unplanned or uncalculated.\n*   **思わず (omowazu):** Something done without thinking.\n*   **距離がわずかなさま (kyori ga wazuka na sama):**  A small gap or interval (often in time).",
