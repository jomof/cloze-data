  "writeup": "場合は is a phrase in Japanese often translated as \"in the event of (A)\" or \"in the case of (A)\".  It's versatile and works with various word types, requiring な after a な-adjective and の after a noun. 場合 by itself means \"case\" or \"situation\".  It frequently highlights hypothetical situations or someone's perspective/characteristic, often in contrast to something already discussed. This contrastive nuance stems from the は particle.  Important Consideration:  Since 場合 implies \"to encounter (A)\", it suggests randomness. Therefore, 場合は isn't used for regularly occurring or planned events.",
  "etymology": "The word 場合 (ばあい) comes from the verb 逢う (あう), meaning \"to meet\" or \"to encounter.\"  The suffix -場合 (-ばあい) thus suggests a situation or circumstance one might encounter.",
