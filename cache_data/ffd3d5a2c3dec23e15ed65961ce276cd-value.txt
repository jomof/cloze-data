  "etymology": "The particle 「って」 is a colloquial contraction of 「と」, the standard quotation particle. This type of abbreviation is common in casual speech to simplify and speed up communication.",
  "writeup": "「って」 is a casual alternative to the 「と」 particle when quoting someone or something. Think of it as a shorthand way of saying \"and then they said...\" or \"I heard that...\" in casual conversation. It is almost always used after direct quotations and followed by a verb indicating what kind of communication was used, such as 言った (itta - said), 思った (omotta - thought), or 聞いた (kiita - heard).\n\nJust like with 「と」, the verb that comes after 「って」 is frequently omitted, especially in casual conversation. However, it is important to remember that because 「って」 is very casual, its use with polite structures (like those ending in `ます` or `です`) can sound unnatural. Nevertheless, in friendly yet still somewhat formal contexts, such as conversations between senior and junior colleagues or students (先輩と後輩), this usage is quite common.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "彼 は 「彼女 は 綺麗な 人だ」 {って} 言った。",
      "english": "He said, \"She is a beautiful person.\"",
      "scene": "Someone repeating what they heard someone say.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "「って」 replaces the more formal 「と」, making the sentence sound more casual. The use of 「彼 は」 indicates the subject who said it, but the sentence structure itself does not contain male-specific speech."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "先生 は 「おはよう！」 {って} 言った。",
      "english": "The teacher said, \"Good morning!\"",
      "scene": "A student telling a friend what their teacher said.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The teacher's direct quote, combined with the particle 「って」, relays the exact greeting from the teacher to another person. Though 「先生」 implies formality, use of 「って」 lowers the register slightly, reflecting a casual report of the formal statement."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "「明日 は 雨 が 降ります か」 {って} 聞いた。",
      "english": "I asked, \"Is it going to rain tomorrow?\"",
      "scene": "Someone recalling a question they asked.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "interrogative",
      "nuance": "The sentence structure with 「って」 illustrates a direct question being relayed in a casual setting. It is a simple way to report speech without needing formal constructions. The phrasing 「降ります か」 is polite, but the use of 「って」 makes the reporting casual."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼 は 「晩ご飯 を 捨てた」 {って} 言った。",
      "english": "He said, \"I threw away my dinner.\"",
      "scene": "Gossiping about what a friend confessed.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "nuance": "Using 「って」 here adds a casual and slightly gossipy tone to the statement. The bluntness of \"throwing away dinner\" might be humorous in the right context. The speaker's gender is not specified, but the sentence is gender-neutral."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼 は 「来週、沖縄 へ 旅行 に 行く」 {って} 言ってたよ。",
      "english": "He was saying, \"I'm going on a trip to Okinawa next week.\"",
      "scene": "A friend sharing some news they heard about another person.",
      "register": "shitashii kuchō (intimate)",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The sentence is delivered in an intimate tone, typical of close friends. The particle 「って」 is used for the direct quotation, and 「言ってたよ」 further emphasizes the casual and informal nature of the report. 「よ」 adds a gentle, informative nuance, common in intimate conversations."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼 が 「好き だ よ」 {って} 言ってた。",
      "english": "He was saying, \"I like you.\"",
      "scene": "A friend telling you that someone has a crush on you.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "「好き だ よ」 is a direct expression of affection, and a female speaker reporting this statement with 「って」 makes the sentence sound casual and intimate. It is the kind of phrase you might hear between close friends or when discussing budding romance. The use of 「言ってた」 maintains the casualness suitable for this intimate setting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "「今度、ご飯 でも どう です か」 {って} 彼 が 言っていました。",
      "english": "He was saying, \"How about we get dinner sometime?\"",
      "scene": "You and your friends are discussing your mutual friend.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "This sentence conveys a polite invitation for dinner from a male speaker, reported by a female using 「って」. The phrase 「ご飯 でも どう です か」 is a common way to suggest a casual date, and the use of 「言っていました」 adds a level of indirectness and politeness to the reporting, even with the casual 「って」 particle."

  "post_example_writeup": "Keep in mind that while 「って」 is versatile, it is essential to use it in appropriate contexts. Overusing it in formal situations might come across as unprofessional. The key is to gauge the environment and adjust your language accordingly.",

      "term": "と (quotation)",

      "meaning": "You could say, You might say",
      "kind": "similar expression",

      "term": "んだって",
      "meaning": "I heard that, He or She said that",
      "kind": "similar expression",
      "nuance": "Unlike 「って」, which directly quotes, 「んだって」 conveys information that was heard from someone else, often with a nuance of surprise or reportage."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "When using 「って」, remember it is a shortened, casual form of 「と」. When deciding which to use, ask yourself whether the setting allows for casual speech. If you are writing an essay or speaking to your boss, stick with 「と」. Use 「って」 with friends and family. As for 「といってもいい」 and 「んだって」, make sure you are using them in the correct context; the former suggests an alternative description, whereas the latter means 'I heard that...'."
