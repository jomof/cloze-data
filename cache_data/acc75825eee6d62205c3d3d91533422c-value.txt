    "writeup": "並み is the noun form of the classical verb 並む, which has the same meaning as 並ぶ, ‘to line up’, or ‘to be in line’. It is used following nouns and can be interpreted as ‘on par with (A)’, ‘worthy of (A)’, or ‘as standard for (A)’. The literal interpretation of ‘in line with (A)’ can also be useful. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Although 並み may occasionally mean ‘as standard for (A)’ as a suffix, the ‘average’ or ‘ordinary’ meaning is often reserved for when 並み is used by itself as a noun. In these cases, it is usually written as 並, followed by the case-marking particle の, and then a second noun indicating what the average refers to.\n*   並み can only be used when (A) has a well-recognized or easily identifiable standard or norm. It sounds unnatural when the ‘norm’ is based on personal opinion rather than an objective standard.",
