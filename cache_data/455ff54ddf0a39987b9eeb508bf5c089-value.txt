  "writeup": "に代わって is a useful expression used with nouns, indicating that someone or something (B) is acting 'in place of' or 'on behalf of' someone or something else (A).  It's a combination of the particle に, the verb 代わる (kawaru) 'to substitute,' and the te-form.  Think of it as (B) taking the place of (A).  The nuance subtly emphasizes the *replacement* aspect, rather than simply 'instead of.'  This is why に代わって can also convey 'to succeed' or 'to replace,' implying a possible permanent change.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of に代わって stems from the verb 代わる (kawaru), meaning \"to replace\" or \"to substitute.\"  The particle に indicates the location or position being replaced, and て-form indicates the action of replacing is ongoing. The overall structure highlights the act of one thing taking the place of another.",

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the nuance of 'replacing' someone or something is maintained across these examples.  Even when it sounds like a simple 'instead of,' the underlying meaning suggests a taking-over of a role or function.

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that に代わって implies a more permanent or significant replacement of roles or positions, while 代わりに simply indicates a substitution. Choose carefully depending on the context."
