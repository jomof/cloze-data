    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ものと思っていた」 expresses a past belief or assumption that turned out to be different from reality. It's formed by 「物(もの)」 (thing), the particle 「と」, and the verb 「思う(おもう)」 (to think) in the past progressive form (ていた).  The nuance is that the speaker **used to think** something was the case. Because 「もの」 is a noun, this pattern can follow any word in its attributive form (e.g., verb in dictionary form, noun + の, i-adjective, na-adjective + な).  The sentence often implies a contrast between the speaker's past belief and the current situation, frequently indicated by conjunctions like 「が」 or 「けど」 in the following clause.",
