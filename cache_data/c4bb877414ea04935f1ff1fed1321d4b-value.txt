    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the verb 「言う (iu)」, meaning \"to say.\" In its passive form, 「言われる (iwareru)」, it means \"to be said.\" Adding 「と」 before 「言われる」 indicates the content of what is being said. The 「いる」 at the end turns it into the continuous form, emphasizing the ongoing or widely accepted nature of the statement.",
    "writeup": "「といわれている」 translates to \"it is said that\" or \"is known as.\" It's used to express a commonly held belief, rumor, or general knowledge. This construction combines the particle 「と」 with the passive form of the verb 「言う (iu) - to say」. Unlike 「とされている」, which emphasizes a result, 「といわれている」 focuses on a quotation or something widely reported. It can be written with or without the kanji for 「言う」 without changing the meaning. In short, you use 「といわれている」 to report what people generally say or believe about something.",
