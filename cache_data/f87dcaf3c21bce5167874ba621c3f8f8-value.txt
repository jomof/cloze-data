  "writeup": "っぱなし is a suffix that originally comes from the u-verb 放す (hanasu, 'to let loose').  When attached to the conjunctive form of verbs, it indicates that something has been 'left' in a certain state.  It's almost exclusively used negatively.  Although 放す means 'to let loose', っぱなし conveys a feeling closer to 'being unchecked'. This means っぱなし can express that 'the act of (A)' is continuing without anyone to stop it, or that 'the state of (A)' is continuing without anyone to stop it. The meaning conveyed depends largely on the verb (A).",
  "etymology": "The suffix っぱなし derives from the verb 放す (hanasu), meaning \"to release,\" \"to let go,\" or \"to leave alone.\" The -っぱし element represents a shortened, informal form of the verb's stem, while -なし indicates a state of being or continuation.  The negative implication arises from the implication of leaving something unattended and potentially causing problems.",

      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,

      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「ねえ」(nee), 「～な」(na), and the emoticon 「🙈」 (hiding face) create an intimate and flirty tone. The phrase 「見つめっぱなし」(mitsumeppanashi) emphasizes the intensity of the gaze, enhancing the flirtatious feeling.  The sentence uses a playful and slightly shy tone, common among young women."

      "kind": "similar",
      "nuance": "Unlike っぱなし, which implies a negative or unintended consequence of something being left in a certain state, ままに (mama ni) simply describes the state of being 'as it is', without necessarily any negative connotation."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both っぱなし and ままに describe a state of being left alone, っぱなし always carries a negative implication of something unintentionally left as is, often with negative consequences.  ままに is more neutral and simply states that something is in a given state.  Consider the situation and intended meaning carefully when selecting the appropriate term."
