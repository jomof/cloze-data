  "writeup": "はず, originating from the kanji 筈, is a Japanese expression conveying a high degree of certainty about something without direct confirmation.  It's similar to the English \"bound to\" or \"should.\"  The most accurate translation is often 'bound to be (A),' conveying a strong expectation.  Because はず is a noun, it's versatile, commonly followed by だ or です.  Important Considerations: Although sometimes translated as 'should,' it only applies when something is expected to be true, not for suggestions or advice.  Omitting だ or です makes the statement slightly less certain, akin to adding \"probably.\"  Speakers may use はず at the end of sentences to indicate uncertainty, similar to 多分 (tabun).",
  "etymology": "The word はず comes from the kanji 筈 (haz), which originally meant the notch of an arrow.  This suggests the idea of something fitting or being expected to happen, like an arrow fitting into a bow.",
