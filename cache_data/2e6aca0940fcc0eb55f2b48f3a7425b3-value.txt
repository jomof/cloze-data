    "etymology": "The word ほとんど is believed to have originated from the combination of 「程 (hodo)」 meaning 'degree' or 'extent' and 「と」, a particle. This suggests that the original meaning was related to expressing a certain degree or limit.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「ほとんど」 is used in many situations in Japanese and often translates as \"most,\" \"hardly any,\" \"almost all,\" and similar expressions. The nuance always depends on the rest of the sentence. The most accurate translation for the word 「ほとんど」 itself is simply \"almost,\" where the thing that it is describing is always considered to be a full group rather than a single thing.\n\nAs with many other adverbs that highlight an \"amount\" in Japanese, 「ほとんど」 can modify a whole phrase or be used before 「の」 to further specify a single noun.\n\nIn negative sentences, 「ほとんど」 translates as \"hardly any.\" This is mainly because the \"full group\" that 「ほとんど」 is describing is highlighted as almost \"not\" existing.",
