    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of 「という」 (meaning 'called' or 'that which is called'), 「物」 (mono, meaning 'thing'), and 「だ」 (da, the plain form of the copula 'desu'). It literally translates to 'it is a thing called [statement],' conveying that something is inherently of a certain nature.",
    "writeup": "「というものだ」 is a fairly strong expression used to convey the speaker's impression, conclusion, or criticism about something based on their understanding or experience. It suggests the speaker believes that something is inherently a certain way. A literal translation might be, \"It is a thing called...\" emphasizing the speaker's certainty. While sometimes used for criticism due to its directness, the context determines its tone. In casual conversation, 「という」 may be shortened to 「って」 without changing the meaning. It is **important** to note that this grammar point cannot be used in the past or negative form.",
