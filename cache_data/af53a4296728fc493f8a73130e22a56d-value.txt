    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に限って」 comes from the particle 「に」 and the て-form of the verb 「限る(かぎる)」 which means \"to limit\". Therefore, the basic sense is of something being limited or specific to a certain situation or person.  The 「て」 form here creates a conjunctive meaning, linking the limited circumstance to the following clause.",

    "writeup": "The expression **に限って** in Japanese has a few core meanings. It can express disbelief or surprise about something related to a specific person or situation. Think of it as saying \"of all people, especially this one!\"  It also indicates a limitation, like saying \"only in this case\" or \"specifically these people\".  A third usage highlights a pattern or tendency where something occurs specifically under certain circumstances. While often translated as \"only when,\" understanding these nuances is **important** for accurate interpretation.  The structure combines the particle **に** with the **te-form** of the verb **限る (かぎる)**, which means \"to limit\".",
