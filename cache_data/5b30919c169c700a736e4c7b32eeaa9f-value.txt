    "etymology": "The grammar point derives from the combination of 「こと」 (koto, 'thing' or 'matter') and 「なの」 (nano), which is a contraction of 「なのだ」 (nanoda). 「こと」 nominalizes the preceding phrase, turning it into a 'thing' or concept. 「なの」 then provides an explanatory or emphatic tone, similar to saying 'it is that...' or 'the fact is...'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ことなの」 is used to explain or clarify the meaning of something. It's similar to 「～のです」 in that it emphasizes the point being made. You can think of it as turning \"it is (A)\" into \"it is that it is (A).\" It's frequently used with 「というのは」 to introduce a topic, with 「ことなの」 providing the conclusion or explanation about that topic. 「というのは」 can be shortened to 「って」 or 「とは」 in casual speech.\n\nThis expression is used after nouns (followed by 「の」) or na-adjectives (followed by 「な」). 「という」 can come directly before 「ことなの」, but it's less common if 「という」 was already used earlier in the sentence.\n\n「ことなの」 is also often used in questions, usually when the speaker wants to confirm their understanding of something that was said. 「なのか」 is common in media but may be considered rude in daily conversation.",
