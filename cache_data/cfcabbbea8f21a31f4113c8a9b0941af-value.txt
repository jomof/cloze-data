  "writeup": "如何なる (ikanaru) is a fascinating word, a testament to the evolution of Japanese.  It's composed of 如何 (ika) and なる (naru), with なる stemming from the classical auxiliary verb なり (nari), 'to be'.  While 如何 itself isn't used independently, its meaning is essentially the same as the modern どう (dō), 'how'.  Therefore, いかなる is often considered interchangeable with どんな (donna), 'what kind of,' but with a crucial difference:  **いかなる is primarily reserved for formal written Japanese, such as academic papers or legal documents.**  It's rarely, if ever, encountered in casual speech. Its attributive nature means it directly precedes the noun it modifies or appears within the same clause.  Similar to どんな, when combined with に (ni), it usually precedes a negative statement, translating to 'no matter how much (A)' or 'no matter what kind of (A),' but the placement of に differs. It follows いかなる, but before the verb. The less common form いかな (ika na) is occasionally seen.  The relationship between な (na) and なる (naru), both derived from なり, is an important aspect of Japanese grammar, illustrating the historical connections between modern and classical forms.  This also ties into なら (nara), the hypothetical form of だ (da), sharing the 'to be' meaning with なり. While な is predominantly used with adjectival nouns, なる still surfaces in more poetic or archaic contexts.",
  "etymology": "いかなる (ikanaru) is a combination of 如何 (ika), meaning 'how,' and なる (naru), the present tense of the verb なる (naru), meaning 'to become' or 'to be.'  The なる portion derives from the classical auxiliary verb なり (nari), which serves to form the attributive form.  This connection to classical Japanese emphasizes its formal and literary usage.",
