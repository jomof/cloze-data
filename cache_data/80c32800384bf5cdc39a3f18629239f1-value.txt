  "writeup": "The phrase と同じくらい (to onaji kurai) means \"about the same as.\"  It's a useful construction combining the particle と (to), meaning \"and,\" the noun 同じ (onaji), meaning \"same,\" and the adverbial particle くらい (kurai), indicating approximation.  The structure is straightforward:  [Noun A] と同じくらい [Noun B], indicating that Noun A is approximately the same as Noun B.  The particle の (no) can be used to connect a descriptive phrase to the first noun. For actions, に (ni) can replace の (no) after くらい to express performing the action in a similar manner. Mastering this phrase adds a nuanced level of expression to your Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's etymology is quite simple, stemming from the natural combination of three common particles and a noun.  と (to) is a conjunction, 同じ (onaji) derives from the verb 同じにする (onaji ni suru) meaning 'to make the same', and くらい (kurai) is an adverb that expresses approximation or degree. The combination is a natural and intuitive way to express approximate equality in Japanese.",
