  "writeup": "The particle ずに (zuni) signifies 'without doing,' attaching to the stem of a verb.  While not one of the primary 18 auxiliary verbs, ず (zu) is a classical auxiliary verb functionally similar to ぬ (nu) and ない (nai), serving to negate.  ずに adds the case-marking particle に (ni) to ず (zu), resulting in 'without doing.'  Its usage mirrors ないで (naide), but ずに carries a more formal tone.  It’s frequently seen in established phrases, such as ずに済む (zuni sumu, 'to manage without doing').  Attach ずに to the -masen stem (the same as for ない).  Crucially, when used with する (suru, 'to do'), it becomes せずに (sezu ni), not しずに (shizu ni).  Both せ (se) and し (shi) are stem forms of する, but し, more common in eastern Japan, appears with ない.",
  "etymology": "ずに (zuni) is derived from the classical negative auxiliary verb ず (zu), which is itself a contraction of the older form ず (nzu).  The addition of に (ni) creates the adverbial form indicating a lack of action before another verb.",
