    "etymology": "方 (kata) literally means \"direction\" or \"way.\" When attached to the ます-stem of a verb, it transforms the verb into a noun that describes the way or method of performing that action.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「かた」 attaches to the ます-stem of a verb to express \"the way of doing (A)\" or \"how to do (A).\" It essentially nominalizes the verb, turning it into a noun-phrase that describes the method or manner of the action. This is similar to the plain meaning of 「方」 as 'way' or 'direction.' When used with する verbs, the construction 「仕方 (しかた)」is often seen, carrying the nuance of \"way of dealing/attending to (A).\" After attaching 「かた」 to a verb, the entire expression can be treated as a noun and followed by particles like は, を, etc., to create longer sentences.",
