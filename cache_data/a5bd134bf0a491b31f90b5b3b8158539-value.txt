  "writeup": "The phrase ～のが下手 (no ga heta) functions similarly to ～のが上手 (no ga jouzu), but indicates 'being bad at' something instead of 'being good at' it.  This is a highly useful expression!  It's used with the plain (dictionary) form of verbs.  There's no difference in usage between ichidan and godan verbs; both appear in their plain form.  In this construction, のが (no ga) serves a nominalizing function, similar to のは (no wa) and other のが (no ga) constructions, converting a phrase into a noun. However, note that のは cannot be used here; が (ga) is obligatory with adjectives.  **Important Consideration:** To express being bad at something *in the past*, the verb remains in its plain form, while 下手 (heta) conjugates to its past tense.",
  "etymology": "下手 (heta) literally means \"lower hand.\"  In the context of skill, it implies lacking proficiency, as one's less-skilled hand might perform tasks poorly. The 'no ga' construction is a standard nominalizer allowing the verb phrase to function as a noun.",
