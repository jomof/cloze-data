    "writeup": "「にて」 is a formal particle that functions similarly to 「で」, indicating the place of an action, the means by which something is done, or the time at which something occurs.  It's essentially a combination of 「に」 and 「て」, but it has evolved into a distinct, more formal case-marking particle. You'll often encounter 「にて」 in written materials, announcements, and business settings where a more sophisticated tone is desired. While 「で」 is the standard and more common choice in everyday conversation, 「にて」 adds a touch of formality and can emphasize the location, method, or time being mentioned. Think of it as a slightly more **official** or **written** way of saying 「で」.",
