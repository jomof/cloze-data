  "writeup": "てごらん is a polite suggestion in Japanese, often translated as '(Please) try to...' or '(Please) look...'.  It uses the て-form of a verb followed by ごらん. While seemingly similar to てみる ('to try'), ごらん, meaning 'to look' or 'to peruse,' adds a nuance of leisurely observation, not necessarily involving effort.  Think of it as a gentler, more open-ended invitation than a direct command.  **Important Consideration:** Because ごらん is honorific, it's inappropriate to use it to refer to your own actions.  It's always a suggestion directed towards others.  The combination ごらんなさい, while implying a suggestion, strengthens it to the point of a light command, mostly used by superiors to subordinates or elders to younger people.",
  "etymology": "ごらん (goran) comes from the verb みる (miru, 'to see, to look').  The ご (go) prefix adds politeness and formality, making it appropriate for suggestions to others. The て-form preceding ごらん allows for various verb conjugations to fit diverse contexts.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "この本を**読んでごらん**。色々なことが学べるよ。",
      "english": "Try reading this book. You'll learn a lot.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": "te-form + goran",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「色々なことが学べるよ」 which is a casual, encouraging statement, fitting the friendly setting and casual register.  The suggestion is soft and non-demanding, reflective of the polite nature of てごらん."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "窓の外を**見てごらん**。綺麗な夕焼けだよ。",
      "english": "Look outside the window. It's a beautiful sunset.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "romantic",
      "conjugation": "te-form + goran",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「綺麗な夕焼けだよ」 which adds a romantic touch. The casual register and gentle suggestion suit a first encounter scenario."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "このケーキを**食べてごらん**。私が作ったんだけど、美味しいと思うよ。",
      "english": "Try this cake. I made it, and I think it's delicious.",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "te-form + goran",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The speaker, a female, uses 「私が作ったんだけど」 to add a personal touch and 「美味しいと思うよ」 to add a hint of coyness, both common in flirtatious speech. The use of てごらん softens the offer, making it inviting rather than forceful."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この映画を**見てごらん**なさい。きっと気に入ると思うわ。",
      "english": "Please try watching this movie. I think you'll really like it.",

      "conjugation": "te-form + goran + nasai",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The addition of 「なさい」 adds a slightly more insistent tone, appropriate for someone trying to engage a date.  The sentence uses 「きっと気に入ると思うわ」 which is a softer form of expression common among females."

      "japanese": "この問題を**解いてごらん**なさい。少し難しいけど、きっと解けるわよ。",

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The use of 「なさい」 combined with 「きっと解けるわよ」 indicates encouragement and a slight push, common when instructing younger individuals. The softer 「わよ」 is typical of a female speaker."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the key to using てごらん effectively lies in understanding its inherent politeness and the context in which it's used.  While seemingly simple, the nuanced interplay between politeness levels and social dynamics makes it a versatile yet subtly powerful expression.",

    {
      "term": "な",
      "meaning": "Do not, Don't (Prohibitive)",
      "kind": "antonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike てごらん, which is a polite suggestion, な is a blunt prohibition."

    {
      "term": "ないでください",
      "meaning": "Please don't (Polite request)",
      "kind": "antonym",

      "term": "てください",
      "meaning": "Please do (Polite request)",
      "kind": "similar",
      "nuance": "While both are polite, てください is a direct request, lacking the gentler, more open-ended feel of てごらん."
    },
    {
      "term": "なさい",
      "meaning": "Command to do",
      "kind": "similar",
      "nuance": "なさい is a command, whereas てごらん is a suggestion.  Combining them creates a polite but more assertive suggestion."
    },
    {
      "term": "てみる",
      "meaning": "To try to",
      "kind": "similar",
      "nuance": "てみる focuses on the act of trying, while てごらん implies a more relaxed, observational approach."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "Distinguishing these similar expressions requires careful attention to context and nuance.  Consider the level of politeness needed and whether a suggestion or a command is more appropriate.  The addition of なさい to てごらん subtly alters its strength, so be mindful of this when choosing which form to use."
