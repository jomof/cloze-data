    "[Phrase in attributive form] + ことから": "Expresses a reason or cause based on a preceding observation or fact."
  },
  "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことから」 is derived from the noun 「こと」 (koto), meaning 'thing' or 'fact,' and the case marking particle 「から」 (kara), meaning 'from.' Thus, it literally means 'from the fact that' something is the case, leading to a particular conclusion or result.",
  "writeup": "The 「ことから」 grammar point is used to express a reason or cause based on an observed fact or situation. It connects an observation (A) with a logical conclusion or result (B), similar to \"from the fact that (A), (B)\" or \"because of (A), (B).\" It is often used in more formal writing and speech. The phrase preceding 「ことから」 must be in its attributive form (the form that modifies a noun). It's important to distinguish 「ことから」 from 「ことだから」. 「ことから」 uses 「から」 as a case-marking particle, highlighting the reason, while 「ことだから」 uses 「から」 as a conjunction, emphasizing the reason directly.",
