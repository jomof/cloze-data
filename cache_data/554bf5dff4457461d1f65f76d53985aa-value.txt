    "etymology": "The particle 「よ」 is believed to have originated from the particle 「ぞ」, which was used in classical Japanese to mark emphasis or assertion. Over time, 「ぞ」 softened into 「よ」, which is now commonly used in modern Japanese.",
    "writeup": "「よ」 is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese used to add emphasis or to inform the listener of something they may not know. Think of it as a gentle nudge, saying, \"Hey, I want you to pay attention to this!\" or \"Just so you know...\". It's added to the end of a sentence, regardless of the sentence's formality level.\n\nOften, you'll see 「よ」 paired with 「ね」 (「〜よね」). This combination seeks confirmation or agreement from the listener, translating roughly to \"...right?\" or \"...you know?\".",
