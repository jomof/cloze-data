    "etymology": "The conjunction 「ども」 is derived from the classical Japanese conjunctive particle 「とも」, which indicates concession or exception. Over time, 「とも」 evolved into 「ども」, retaining a similar meaning but often carrying a more literary or formal nuance.",
    "writeup": "The conjunction 「ども」 indicates concession or exception, similar to \"even though\" or \"although\" in English. It's typically used in **formal writing and speech**, lending a sophisticated tone. 「ども」 often appears in situations where something unexpected or contrary to expectation occurs. It can also express a sense of \"no matter how much/often/hard/etc.\" when the same verb is repeated in the conditional form. Although it shares similarities with 「ても」 and 「とも」, 「ども」 carries a more **literary and formal flavor**.",
