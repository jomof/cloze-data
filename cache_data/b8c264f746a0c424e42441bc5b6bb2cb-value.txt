    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に則って・に則り」 comes from the verb 「則る（のっとる）」 which means \"to conform to; to be based on; to go by\". The particle 「に」 indicates the basis or standard being followed. Therefore, the literal sense is that an action or decision follows or is based upon something else.",
    "writeup": "「に則って」 and its slightly more formal variant 「に則り」 are used to express that something is done **according to**, **in accordance with**, or **based on** a certain rule, law, standard, or tradition.  It carries a formal nuance and is often found in written materials or official announcements. The verb 「則る（のっとる）」 means \"to conform to,\" and the 「に」 indicates the standard being followed.  Therefore, the expression literally means \"following the standard of\".  The 「て」-form 「に則って」 is more commonly used in spoken language and as a conjunction, while 「に則り」 is more frequently seen at the end of a sentence or clause in formal writing. This grammar point is used when referring to established guidelines, laws, company policies, or long-standing traditions.",
