    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[imperfective]+言わず~と言わず」 or 「Noun + 言わず~と言わず」 is used to express that something is true not only for A and B, but also for many other things that belong to the same category. It emphasizes the wide scope or range to which something applies. Think of it as saying \"not only this, but also that, and pretty much everything else too.\" It is commonly used in formal or semi-formal contexts to emphasize the extent of something.\n\n*   **Structure**: 「Verb[imperfective]+言わず~と言わず」 or 「Noun + 言わず~と言わず」\n*   **Meaning**: Not only A but also B, and pretty much everything else; whether X or Y; including X and Y.\n*   **Nuance**: Conveys a sense of comprehensiveness or all-inclusiveness.",
