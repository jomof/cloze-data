    "etymology": "The verb 「する」originated from the Old Japanese verb 「為(し)つ (sitsu)」, meaning \"to do\" or \"to make.\" Over time, the 「つ (tsu)」 was dropped, evolving into the modern 「する (suru).」",
    "writeup": "「する」verbs are unique because they do not follow standard conjugation patterns. 「する」 means \"to do\" something, or \"to make\" something a certain way.  Generally, 「する」will have the particle 「を」attached to the object being acted upon.  The る in 「する」is dropped and then 「す」 conjugates. This gives 「する」 qualities of both 「る」-Verbs and 「う」-Verbs.\n\nSome example conjugations include: \n\n*   (さ)せる\n*   (し)ます\n*   (す)る\n*   (せ)よ\n\n「する」 can generally be thought of as \"to do something that has an external effect\".",
