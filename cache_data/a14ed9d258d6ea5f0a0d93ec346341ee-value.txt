    "etymology": "The word 「そこ」 is derived from the demonstrative series 「こ、そ、あ、ど」, indicating proximity to the speaker (「ここ」), proximity to the listener (「そこ」), distance from both (「あそこ」), and an interrogative (「どこ」). 「そこ」 specifically refers to a place closer to the listener than to the speaker.",
    "writeup": "「そこ」 is part of the 「それ」 family of words, used to identify something close to the listener. In this instance, it designates a place. Just as 「それ」 represents \"that,\" 「そこ」 represents \"that place,\" or simply \"there.\"\n\nSimilar to how 「それ」 can reference something previously mentioned, 「そこ」 can refer back to a previously mentioned place. The kanji form is 「其処」, though it is not commonly used.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\nDo not confuse 「そこ」 with 「そっち」, a similar word also translated as \"there.\" 「そっち」 emphasizes direction, while 「そこ」 focuses solely on \"that place.\"",
