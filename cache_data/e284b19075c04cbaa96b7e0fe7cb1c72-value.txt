    "etymology": "The verb 「する」 originally meant \"to do\" or \"to make.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the concept of something costing a certain amount, essentially \"making\" or \"equaling\" that value. This usage likely stemmed from the idea of a transaction, where something \"does\" or \"makes\" a particular price.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「する」, in this context, is used to express the cost of something or the duration of time. It's a versatile verb that can be used in various situations. \n\n**Key points:**\n*   It's essential to identify the **object** and the **amount** when dealing with cost. The pattern is [Object] + は/が + [Amount] + する.\n*   When indicating duration, it's used with a time period. For example, [Time Period] + する\n*   「する」 is an irregular verb, so be mindful of its conjugations. The polite form 「します」 is commonly used, while the plain form 「する」 is prevalent in casual conversations.",
