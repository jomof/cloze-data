  "writeup": "The common Japanese expression と思う (to omou) means \"I think.\"  It's a combination of the particle と (to) and the verb 思う (omou, to think).  You can use と思う after verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns.  However, after nouns and な-adjectives, the copula だ (da) is usually needed, although it's often omitted in casual speech.  Important Considerations:  When expressing someone else's thoughts, use と思っている (to omotte iru), which implies a continuing state of thought.  This is because と思う suggests a more permanent belief, unlike a fleeting thought which someone else might have. Using と思っている for your own thoughts also emphasizes the ongoing nature of your thinking process.",
  "etymology": "The verb 思う (omou) has ancient roots tracing back to classical Japanese.  Its usage has evolved to express a range of thoughts and beliefs, from simple suppositions to more considered opinions.",
