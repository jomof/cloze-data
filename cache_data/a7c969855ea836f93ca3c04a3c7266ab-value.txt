        "[Verb in past tense] + ところで": "Indicates a hypothetical situation and its likely futile outcome."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たところで」 combines the past tense form of a verb (た), the noun 「ところ」 (place, situation), and the particle 「で」 (at, in). The 'situation' refers to the hypothetical action described by the verb in the past tense. The 「で」 marks that the following statement is true even in that 'situation'.",
    "writeup": "「たところで」 expresses the idea that even if something were to happen, it wouldn't change the outcome, often implying a negative or futile result. It conveys a sense of resignation or disbelief in the possibility of a positive change. The structure emphasizes the speaker's feeling that the action is unlikely to make a difference. It is often used with adverbs like 「いくら」 (however much), 「どんなに」 (no matter how), or 「今さら」 (even now) to further emphasize the futility of the action. The second half of the sentence typically expresses an unfavorable outcome.",
