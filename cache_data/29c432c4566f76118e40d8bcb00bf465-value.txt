    "etymology": "The grammar point \"Verb+にいく\" is formed by combining the particle 「に」, which indicates purpose or destination, with the verb 「いく」(iku), meaning \"to go\". The verb preceding 「に」is in its stem form (masu-stem), indicating the action one goes to perform.",
    "writeup": "「Verb+にいく」 indicates going somewhere for the **purpose** of doing something. The verb before 「にいく」must be in its stem form (the form you get when you drop the 「ます」 from a 「ます」form verb). This grammar point is usually translated as \"to go in order to (verb)\" or \"to go to (verb)\". For example, 「食べにいく」(tabe ni iku) means \"to go to eat.\"",
