  "writeup": "てすみません is a polite expression conveying regret or apology for a past action or situation.  It's frequently translated as \"I'm sorry for...\" but carries a nuanced meaning.  The て form indicates the cause of the apology, highlighting the speaker's regret about the outcome.  This construction often implies a sense of unfinished business or a feeling that something is incomplete due to the action mentioned. Unlike a simple 'sumimasen,' this phrasing emphasizes the speaker's responsibility for the situation, even if it wasn't entirely within their control.  Think of it as expressing a feeling of 'unfinished business' resulting from the action.",
  "etymology": "This phrase stems from the verb 済む (sumu), meaning 'to be finished' or 'to be settled.'  すみません (sumimasen) is the negative polite form of this verb, literally implying 'not finished' or 'unsettled.' The て form connects this 'unfinished' feeling to the preceding action or event, creating an apology that emphasizes the speaker's awareness of the negative outcome.",

    {
      "japanese": "待ち合わせの時間に遅れてすみません。",
      "english": "I'm sorry for being late to our meeting.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a standard, polite apology. The phrase 「遅れて」 (okurete) clearly indicates the reason for the apology."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "少しの間、あなたを待たせてすみません",
      "english": "Sorry to have kept you waiting for a little while.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a softer apology, suitable for a friendly setting.  The addition of 「少しの間」 (sukoshi no aida) adds a touch of politeness and makes it less formal than a direct 'I'm sorry for making you wait.'"
    },
    {
      "japanese": "約束を破ってすみません。",
      "english": "I'm sorry for breaking my promise.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This expresses regret for a broken promise. The use of 「破って」 (yabutte) directly links the apology to the act of breaking a promise."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あのね、君のことが好きになってしまって、すみません…",
      "english": "Hey, um... I'm sorry, I've fallen for you...",

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "This flirty apology uses 「あのね」(anone) and 「…」(ellipses), which are common in intimate conversations between younger people.  The phrase 「好きになってしまって」(suki ni natte shimatte) adds a sense of helplessness to the confession, making it more endearing."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたのケーキを全部食べちゃってすみません！",
      "english": "I'm so sorry! I ate all your cake!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual 「食べちゃって」(tabechatte) and the exclamation point (!) show a more informal and regretful tone. This is typical of a younger speaker apologizing to a close friend."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "昨日、貴社の会議に遅刻してしまい、大変申し訳ございませんでした。",
      "english": "I sincerely apologize for being late to your company meeting yesterday.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This highly formal apology uses 「大変申し訳ございませんでした」(taihen moushiwake gozaimasendeshita), which is far more formal and respectful than 「すみません」 (sumimasen).  The use of 敬語 (keigo) shows respect to the listener. Suitable for a business context or apologizing to a superior."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while the translation is often \"I'm sorry for...,\" the underlying meaning emphasizes the speaker's regret over an outcome caused by their actions.  The level of formality can be adjusted by using more or less polite language.",
