    "etymology": "The etymology of 「こそ」 is debated, but it is believed to have originated from words emphasizing existence or location. It evolved to function as an emphatic particle, highlighting the importance of the preceding word or phrase. It's related to other emphatic particles and adverbs in Japanese that share a similar function of focusing attention.",
    "writeup": "「こそ」 is an adverbial particle in Japanese that primarily replaces 「を」 or 「が」. Its main role is to highlight the preceding noun (or noun phrase) as the most important piece of information in relation to the rest of the sentence. In English, this effect is achieved through emphasizing a particular word in speech or using bold text or underlining. 「こそ」 can convey nuances such as \"precisely because it's (A)\" or \"rather it is due to (A).\" It can be used directly after any noun that would usually take the 「を」 or 「が」 particles, as long as that particular piece of information needs to be emphasized.\n\nThe reason that 「こそ」 is able to replace 「が」, but not 「は」, is because 「が」 primarily highlights specific pieces of information, while 「は」 nominates general topics. They have completely opposite functions.\n\nTo make things easier, the three particles can be thought of in the following way:\n\n*   「は」 - Weakly highlights specific information.\n*   「が」 - Strongly highlights specific information.\n*   「こそ」 - Very strongly highlights specific information.\n\n「こそ」 is often used after names or pronouns as a way to reply to thanks or apologies. In these situations, it expresses that the speaker feels equally (or more) obliged to say what was just said to them by someone else.",
