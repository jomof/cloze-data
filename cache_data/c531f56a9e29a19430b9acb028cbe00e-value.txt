    "etymology": "「嫌い」 comes from the verb 「嫌う」 (kirau), meaning \"to hate\" or \"to dislike\". It evolved into a な-adjective to describe the state of disliking something.",
    "writeup": "「嫌い」 (kirai), meaning \"to dislike\", is a common **な-adjective** (adjectival noun) in Japanese. As an adjectival noun, its form changes depending on how it functions in a sentence. When modifying another noun, it takes the form 「嫌いな」. When used predicatively, it typically uses 「嫌いだ」 in plain form or 「嫌いです」 in polite form. For example, 「嫌いだ」 asserts that something *is dislikable*, while 「嫌いな」 describes *being disliked* as a quality of the noun it precedes. Just like 「好き」 (suki) can be combined with 「大」 (dai) to form 「大好き」 (daisuki) meaning \"love\", 「嫌い」 can be combined with 「大」 to form 「大嫌い」 (daikirai), meaning \"to hate\". **Important Note:** Despite ending in い, 「嫌い」 is a な-adjective, not an い-adjective. This can be confusing for learners, so pay close attention.",
