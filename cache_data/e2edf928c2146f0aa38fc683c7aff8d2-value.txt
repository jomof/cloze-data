  "writeup": "ことがある is a versatile Japanese expression combining こと (thing) with the particle が (subject marker) and the verb ある (to exist).  It's often translated as 'to be possible,' 'to occasionally occur,' or 'to sometimes happen.'  A more literal translation, however, is '(A) is a thing that exists.'  This structure can be used with the attributive form of virtually any verb.  The particle が can sometimes be replaced with も, implying that '(A) is also a thing that exists,'  emphasizing (A) as a factor to consider.  **Important Consideration:** ことがある differs significantly from たことがある (often paired with past-tense verbs).  たことがある points to a single completed event. In contrast, ことがある simply indicates that there are 'times' when the action happens, not a specific instance.",
  "etymology": "The etymology is straightforward.  こと is a noun meaning 'thing' or 'matter,' and ある is the verb 'to exist' or 'to be.'  The combination creates a nuanced meaning suggesting the existence of instances where the preceding action takes place.",
