    "etymology": "必要 (hitsuyou) is a Sino-Japanese word. The kanji 必要 literally translates to \"must have\" or \"essential\".  要 (you) means \"need\" or \"require,\" and 必 (hitsu) means \"certainly\" or \"inevitably,\" emphasizing the necessity.",
    "writeup": "「が必要」 (ga hitsuyou) directly translates to \"is necessary\" or \"is needed.\"  It's a straightforward way to express the necessity of a noun. The particle 「が」 marks the noun as the subject that is needed.  While often used with the copula 「だ」 in its polite form 「が必要です」, the 「だ」 can be omitted in casual speech, although 「が」 is usually retained for clarity. This grammar point exclusively connects to nouns. If you need to express the necessity of an action (verb), you'll need to nominalize the verb.",
