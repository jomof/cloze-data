  "writeup": "The grammar point ことなの combines こと (thing, fact) with なの (explanatory particle).  It emphasizes a point, providing an explanation or clarification similar to んです/のです, but with a slightly stronger emphasis.  It's often used in conjunction with というのは (which is), creating a structure where というのは introduces the topic, and ことなの delivers the concluding explanation.  This works with attributive forms, nouns with の, and な-adjectives with な.  While という (means) can precede ことなの, it's not always necessary, especially if already used earlier in the sentence.  Be aware that というのは is often shortened to って or とは in casual speech.  Furthermore, ことなの is frequently found in questions to confirm understanding of a point.  While common in media, its use in direct questioning can sound slightly blunt or even rude in casual conversation.",
  "etymology": "こと comes from the verb する (to do), and evolves into a noun meaning \"thing\" or \"matter.\" なの is a combination of the copula な and の, an explanatory particle.  The combination creates a nuanced way to present facts or explanations, emphasizing the \"it is that\" aspect.",
