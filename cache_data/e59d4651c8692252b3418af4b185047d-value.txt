  "etymology": "抜く (nuku) comes from the ancient verb 抜く, meaning 'to pull out' or 'to extract'.  This original meaning has evolved to encompass the sense of completing something thoroughly, overcoming obstacles, and persevering to the end. The nuance of 'completely' or 'thoroughly' stems from the image of completely removing or extracting something.",
  "writeup": "The verb 抜く (nuku), meaning 'to extract' or 'to pull out', when used with the masu-stem of another verb, gains a crucial nuance: 'completely,' 'thoroughly,' or 'to the bitter end.'  Think of it as conveying the sense of overcoming challenges to achieve a complete result.  It's akin to the English expression 'to pull through' – 'despite difficulties, I pulled through in the end.'  This isn't merely about completion; it emphasizes overcoming adversity.  It often implies a significant effort or struggle.  For verbs describing actions with an inherent end, such as finishing a task, it suggests total accomplishment.  For actions without a clear endpoint, like learning, it implies mastering the subject completely.  Important Considerations:  While similar to きる (kiru), 抜く (nuku) emphasizes the struggle and perseverance involved. It generally refers to human actions, whereas きる (kiru) can be broader.  Furthermore,  抜く (nuku) often appears with 最後まで (saigo made - until the end).",
