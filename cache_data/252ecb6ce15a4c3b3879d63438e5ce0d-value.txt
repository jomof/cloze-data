  "writeup": "The adverbial phrase ごとに (goto ni) means \"each,\" \"every,\" or \"per.\"  It's formed by combining the noun ごと (goto), meaning \"each,\" with the particle に (ni), indicating time or frequency.  It's commonly used with nouns or noun phrases, specifying the regularity of an action.  For example, \"毎週ごとに\" (maisyū goto ni) means \"every week.\" While it *can* follow verbs, noun-based phrases are far more prevalent.  Remember that ごと is the kun'yomi (native Japanese reading) of the kanji 毎 (mai), reinforcing its meaning of \"every.\"  This is crucial in distinguishing it from おきに (okini), a similar expression that emphasizes the *interval* or *gap* between occurrences.  Think of it this way:\n\n* (A)ごとに (A goto ni): During every (A), (B)\n* (A)おきに (A okini): After every space/interval of (A), (B)\n\nFor instance, \"一週間ごとに\" (isshūkan goto ni) means \"every week,\" while \"一週間おきに\" (isshūkan okini) would mean \"every other week.\"  Even native speakers sometimes confuse these; however, the subtle difference is important.  Understanding the nuance improves your fluency.",
  "etymology": "The word ごとに (goto ni) is a combination of the noun ごと (goto), which is the kun'yomi reading of the kanji 毎 (meaning 'every'), and the particle に (ni), which marks time or frequency.  The combination creates an adverbial phrase indicating regularity.",
