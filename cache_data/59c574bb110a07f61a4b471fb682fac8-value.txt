        "Usage": "Often used in formal contexts to inquire about the state or condition of something, or to indicate that a certain outcome depends on specific circumstances. The 「だ」 is often omitted, especially in writing."

    "formation": {
        "Noun + 如何(だ)": "Used to ask 'how' something is or to express dependence on a certain state.",
        "Noun + の + 如何 + で/によっては/を問わず": "Indicates 'depending on' or 'regardless of' the state or condition of the noun."
    },
    "etymology": "「如何」 originates from classical Chinese, where it carried a similar meaning of \"how\" or \"what way.\" It was adopted into Japanese and retained its core sense of inquiry about the manner or condition of something. The 「だ」 is a copula that links the noun-like 「如何」 to the predicate, indicating a state or condition. This term is now mostly found in formal or literary contexts.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「如何(だ)・いかん(だ)」 is a formal way to ask \"how\" or \"in what way.\" It often appears in writing and formal speech. Its nuance is similar to 「どのように」 but is more literary. It can also express that something depends on a particular condition or state. 「如何」 is frequently seen with phrases like 「～の如何で」 (depending on ~) or 「～の如何を問わず」 (regardless of ~). Because of its formal nature, you'll rarely hear it in casual conversation.",
