    "etymology": "The grammar point 「には及ばない」 is a combination of the particle 「に」, the topic marker 「は」, and the negative form of the verb 「及ぶ」 (reach, extend). Literally, it means \"it does not reach/extend to,\" indicating that something does not measure up to a certain standard or level.",
    "writeup": "「には及ばない」 (ni wa oyobanai) expresses that something is **inferior** or **not comparable** to something else. It indicates that one thing falls short of the other. Often, the comparison involves something of very high quality or status. Think of it as saying, \"It doesn't even come close.\" A set phrase you might encounter is 「足元にも及ばない」 (ashimoto ni mo oyobanai), meaning \"not even close to reaching someone's feet,\" implying a vast difference in ability or status.",
