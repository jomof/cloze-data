    "katakana": "ヨウスルニ",

  },
  "etymology": "要するに is a compound phrase. 要 (yō) means 'to need' or 'to require,' stemming from the verb 要する (yōsuru).  The particle に (ni) functions as a topic marker, indicating that the following clause summarizes the preceding information.",
  "writeup": "要するに (yōsuruni) is a crucial expression for concise communication in Japanese, directly translating to \"in short,\" \"to sum up,\" or \"in summary.\"  It effectively condenses prior information, highlighting the essential point.  Understanding its nuance is key.  **Critically, 要するに always appears at the beginning of a sentence.** It's a common phrase used in everyday conversation and various settings, from casual chats to more formal discussions.  While it has synonyms, its positioning at the sentence's start distinguishes it.  Mastering this concise expression will greatly enhance your communication skills.",
