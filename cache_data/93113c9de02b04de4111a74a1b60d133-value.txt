        "Register": "Varies with context (can be casual or polite).",

    "formation": {
        "[Noun: price/duration] + する": "Indicates cost or duration."
    },
    "etymology": "「する」 originally meant 'to do' or 'to make.' Its use in expressing cost and time is a figurative extension of the idea that an object 'does' or 'takes' a certain amount of money or time. In the case of cost, 「する」is seen as doing some amount of damage to your wallet. The imperative form 「しろ」is related to the modern 「白」 meaning 'white'.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「する」, in this context, expresses the **cost** of something or the **duration** of time. For example, 「この時計は十万円する」 means \"This watch costs 100,000 yen.\" When used to indicate a lapse of time, it's typically found in subordinate clauses, such as 「後一年したら大学を出る」, meaning \"In another year, I'll graduate from college.\"",
