  "writeup": "The adverbial particle まで is used to emphasize the extent or limit of an action or state.  It translates to \"even,\" \"to the extent of,\" or \"as far as.\"  Unlike its use indicating \"until,\" this usage highlights a surprising or noteworthy aspect.  It can follow verbs or nouns.  While seemingly different from the \"until\" meaning, both uses share the same core: (A)まで (B), where (A) sets the limit, and (B) is the remarkable element.  This element is often a descriptive verb, adjective, or clause.  The particle も is sometimes used with まで to intensify the surprising or satisfying nature of the described event. For example,  『バナナまで食べた！』 \"I even ate a banana!\"  emphasizes the unexpected consumption of the banana.",
  "etymology": "The particle まで is thought to have evolved from the verb ま(de), meaning \"to arrive at\" or \"reach.\"  This reflects the sense of reaching a limit or boundary implied by the particle's function.  The semantic shift from indicating arrival to denoting the extent or limit demonstrates the richness and evolution of Japanese grammar.",

      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
