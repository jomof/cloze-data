  "writeup": "どこ (doko) is a Japanese interrogative pronoun meaning \"where.\"  It's a fundamental word used to ask about location.  It belongs to the どれ (dore) family of words, all used to inquire about an unknown item.  Think of どれ as \"which\" and どこ as \"which place.\"  It's essential for basic conversation and appears across various registers.  While generally straightforward, understanding the subtle difference between どこ and similar words like どっち (docchi, 'which way') is crucial for accurate communication.  どっち implies direction or choice between two options, whereas どこ focuses solely on the location itself.",
  "etymology": "The word どこ (doko) derives from the Old Japanese interrogative pronoun *toko*.  This ancient form provides insight into the word's historical usage and linguistic evolution within the broader context of Japanese interrogative particles.",
