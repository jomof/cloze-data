    "etymology": "結構 (けっこう) is a Sino-Japanese word, meaning that it was borrowed from Chinese. The individual kanji mean: 結 (ketsu) - to tie, bind, or conclude, and 構 (kou) - structure, framework, or composition. Together, they suggest a well-structured or satisfactory arrangement, which then evolved to mean 'quite' or 'sufficient'. Its use as 'no thank you' is a more recent development, implying that one is satisfied with the current state and doesn't require anything more.",
    "writeup": "結構 (けっこう) is often used as an adverb to mean \"quite,\" \"a lot,\" or \"fairly.\" While technically a な-adjective, it functions more commonly as an adverb, modifying the entire sentence rather than just a noun. However, it's **important** to note that 結構です is also a common set phrase used to politely decline something, similar to saying \"no thank you\" or \"I'm fine, thanks\" in English. For instance, if someone offers you a sample in a store, you can simply say 結構です.",
