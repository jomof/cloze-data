    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「こと」 (koto, 'thing' or 'matter'), 「に」 (ni, a particle indicating direction or purpose), and 「なる」 (naru, 'to become'). Thus, it literally means 'to become a matter,' implying a result, decision, or outcome.",
    "writeup": "「ことになる」 is an expression that combines the nominalizing use of 「こと」 (creating a noun-phrase), with the case marking particle 「に」, and the う - Verb 「なる」 'to become'. This expression can be translated as 'to become (A)', but has the nuance that someone/thing caused (A) to become that way. Due to this, it may also be translated as 'it has been decided that (A)', or 'it will end up being (A)'. 「ことになる」 is primarily used with verbs and い-Adjectives in their attributive form. It may also be used with な-Adjectives followed by 「な」. The 'it has been decided that (A)' meaning only applies to verbs, as only verbs will be enacted by someone/thing.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   This structure is a good example of why 「なる」 is often viewed as the intransitive form of 「する」. 「する」 conveys that someone is performing an action (transitive), while 「なる」 implies that something is the result of an action (intransitive). This is why the (A) phrase in 「ことになる」 is usually determined to have been decided/performed by someone else, while still focusing on exactly 'what' (A) became.",
