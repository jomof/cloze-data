    "etymology": "だろう is derived from the copula だ, indicating assertion, and the auxiliary verb ろう, originally signifying speculation or presumption. Over time, the combination evolved to express conjecture or seek confirmation.",
    "writeup": "だろう is a conjugated form of だ and can also be seen in the contracted form だろ (more casual). だろう expresses that the speaker thinks that something is true (assertion/expectation), and also that the listener would probably agree with them. This comes across like \"right?\" or \"probably\" in English.\n\nだろう carries exactly the same meaning as でしょう (the polite equivalent). However, because だ is more casual than です, だろう is also considered more casual/masculine than でしょう.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nWhile だろう is usually used when the speaker has some sort of information that would support their assertion, it can also be used simply when the speaker 'feels' that something is true. In this kind of sentence that expresses a 'feeling' or 'hunch', だろう comes across as quite low confidence. The speaker's tone of voice will often reveal how confident だろう is.",
