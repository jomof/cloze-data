    "etymology": "「だが」is a conjunction formed from 「だ」 (the plain form of 「です」, a copula indicating affirmation) and 「が」 (a conjunction indicating contrast). 「ですが」 is simply the polite form, using 「です」 instead of 「だ」.",
    "writeup": "「だが」 and 「ですが」 are used to express contrast or contradiction, similar to \"but\" or \"however\" in English. Think of it as a formal way to say, \"That may be so, **but**...\" 「だが」 is the plain form and 「ですが」 is the polite form. Because 「ですが」 uses 「です」, the rest of the sentence should also be in polite form. In modern Japanese, using 「ね」 at the end of 「だが」 to soften it is rare, and more common among older generations. In casual speech, 「でも」 is more frequently used than 「だが」.",
