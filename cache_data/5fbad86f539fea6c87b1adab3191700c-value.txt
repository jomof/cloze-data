        "Usage": "Used with verbs, nouns, i-adjectives, and na-adjectives. The particle 「も」 follows each element to create the parallel structure."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「も」 originally indicates 'also' or 'too.' When used in the 「も~も」 pattern, it emphasizes the presence or absence of both elements being described.",
    "writeup": "The 「も~も」 grammar pattern is used to express that two things are true or exist, or that neither of two things is true or exists. It creates a sense of balance or parallelism between the two elements. The pattern can be used with verbs, nouns, い-adjectives and な-adjectives, each having a slightly different construction. \n\n*   **Verbs**: The ます-stem of the verb is followed by 「も」. For example, 「読みも書きもする」 (both read and write).\n*   **Nouns**: The noun is directly followed by 「も」. For example, 「料理も掃除もする」 (both cook and clean).\n*   **い-adjectives**: The い ending is dropped and replaced with 「く」, followed by 「も」. For example, 「うれしくも悲しくもある」 (both happy and sad).\n*   **な-adjectives/Nouns**: Add 「で」 after the stem, followed by 「も」. For example, 「便利でもあるし、経済的でもある」 (both convenient and economical).\n\nThe 「も~も」 pattern is versatile and adds nuance to your Japanese expressions, allowing you to convey a balanced perspective.",
