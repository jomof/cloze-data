  "writeup": "いくら～でも, translates to \"no matter how much,\" or \"however much.\"  It's similar to どんなに～ても, but emphasizes *quantity* rather than *quality* or *degree*.  While often used with negative verbs (e.g., ない, ありません), indicating a futile effort, it can also appear in positive sentences, highlighting the unexpected extent or magnitude.  The structure is  いくら [adjective/noun] でも [result].  The result phrase often contrasts with the initial condition, emphasizing the lack of impact from the initial clause.  For example, \"いくら頑張っても…\" (\"no matter how hard I try\") implies that effort won't necessarily lead to success.  Think of it as a strong expression of a persistent condition, despite the action or effort described. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n* いくら emphasizes the *amount* or *quantity*.  Use どんなに～ても if the focus is on the *degree* or *type* of something.\n* The result clause often highlights something that is negated or surprising in extent.",
  "etymology": "The word いくら comes from the kanji 幾ら, meaning \"how much.\"  The particle でも adds the nuance of \"even if\" or \"no matter.\" The combination creates an expression emphasizing quantity or amount and the lack of influence from that quantity on a resulting condition.",
