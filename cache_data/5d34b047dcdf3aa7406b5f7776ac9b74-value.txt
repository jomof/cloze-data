  "writeup": "The grammar point ようになる (yō ni naru) means \"to become able to,\" \"to come to be,\" or \"to eventually.\"  It's formed by combining よう (yō, meaning \"like this\" or \"in such a way\") with the verb なる (naru, meaning \"to become\"). The nuance is that the action described now becomes achievable or habitual.  This is often translated as \"to reach the point where...\"  It's versatile and used across various contexts and speech registers.  The structure usually follows the potential form of a verb. Keep in mind that する (suru) verbs, which don't have a regular potential form, use できる (dekiru, \"to be able to\") instead, as in 料理ができるようになる (ryōri ga dekiru yō ni naru, \"to become able to cook\").  The negative form expresses the inability to reach a certain point; for example,  来年から現金が使えないようになる (rainen kara genkin ga tsukaenai yō ni naru, \"From next year, it will no longer be possible to use cash.\") shows a change to impossibility.",
  "etymology": "ようになる is a combination of よう (yō), meaning 'in a manner like this,' or 'so that,' and なる (naru), meaning 'to become.'  The よう particle indicates the desired state, which is then achieved via the process of 'becoming.'  The combination thus reflects a gradual progression into that state, not simply a sudden change.",
