    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 originally indicated co-occurrence or accompaniment. Over time, it evolved to mark direct quotations as the words being 'said with' the action of speaking. Its use expanded to encompass indirect quotations, thoughts, and manners, retaining the core sense of association or equivalence.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「と」 is versatile, serving multiple functions primarily related to indicating **content or manner**. It's commonly used to mark direct quotations, indirect quotations, and even one's own internal thoughts. For example, 「私は学生です」と先生は言いました (\"I am a student,\" the teacher said). It also connects actions with sounds, states, or manners, often with mimetic words such as バタバタと (with a clattering noise) or しっとりと (gently). The 「と」 particle effectively specifies *how* an action occurs or *what* is being thought, said, or written. Although 「と」 is used extensively with mimetic words, keep in mind these are not just children's words; they are an important part of the Japanese vocabulary.",
