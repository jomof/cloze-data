  "writeup": "This grammar point, とかんがえられている (to kangae rarete iru), utilizes the particle と (to) to connect a preceding phrase with a passive form of the verb 考える (kangaeru - to think, to consider).  It translates as \"is considered to be...\" or \"is thought to be...\" and indicates a widely held belief or opinion, not necessarily the speaker's own. The passive form emphasizes that the thought or consideration isn't originating from the speaker but reflects a general consensus.  While technically passive, it's often used to strengthen an assertion by implying general agreement, much like saying \"everyone knows that...\" in English.  Note its frequent use with 考えられている (kanagara rete iru - is considered) and 思われている (omowarete iru - is thought).",
  "etymology": "The structure combines the topic-marking particle と (to), indicating the preceding phrase as the topic of the sentence.  The passive form of 考える (kangaeru), rarete iru, shows the impersonal nature of the considered opinion. This passive construction, typical in Japanese, allows the expression of a commonly held belief without explicitly stating who holds that belief.",

      "conjugation": "passive non-past",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of よ (yo) at the end adds a softening effect, making the compliment less direct and more suggestive.  The phrase 「とても魅力的だ」(totemo miryoku-tekida) is a straightforward, positive description, but the addition of と考えられている (to kanagara rete iru) adds a layer of indirectness, suggesting that this is a commonly held view."

      "nuance": "The politeness of the sentence, indicated by ん です (n desu), is appropriate for a first encounter. The use of 「とても素敵だ」(totemo sutekida) in a polite context is suitable, and the grammar point reinforces a positive statement about the listener."

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the level of certainty and the source of the information.  とかんがえられている (to kanagara rete iru) implies a generally accepted belief, while と考えられる (to kangaerareru) presents a possibility, and といわれている (to iwarete iru) suggests hearsay or common knowledge. Choosing the correct expression depends on the degree of conviction and the source of the statement."
