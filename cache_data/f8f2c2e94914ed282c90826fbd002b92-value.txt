  "etymology": "に先立ち is a grammatical structure built upon the verb 先立つ (sakadatsu), meaning \"to precede\" or \"to take the lead.\"  The particle に marks the preceding event or action, while 先立ち is the formal-conjunctive form of 先立つ. This elegant combination expresses a formal and somewhat literary nuance.",
  "writeup": "The Japanese grammatical structure \"に先立ち (ni sakadachi)\" translates to \"before,\" \"prior to,\" or \"in preference to.\" It's a formal expression, commonly used in written Japanese and more formal settings.  It's formed by combining the particle に (ni), indicating a time or condition, with the formal-conjunctive form 先立ち (sakadachi) of the verb 先立つ (sakadatsu), meaning \"to precede.\"  The structure typically connects a preliminary action or event (B) with a main action or event (A), suggesting (B) must occur before (A).  Understanding the verb's literal meaning—'to stand before'—can help grasp the sequential relationship implied. While the て-form 先立って (sakadatte) is also possible, 先立ち is generally preferred for its more formal and concise nature.  This grammar point is particularly useful when emphasizing the importance of a prerequisite step before a main event.",

The choice between the dictionary form, て-form and the formal-conjunctive form often depends on the context and desired level of formality.  Consider the overall sentence structure and the level of formality needed when deciding which form to use.",
