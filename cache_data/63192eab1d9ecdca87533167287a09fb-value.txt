    "etymology": "だに is derived from the verb 「断つ」 (tatsu), meaning \"to cut off\" or \"to stop.\" The particle implies a sense of limitation or exclusion, suggesting that something is so extreme that it \"cuts off\" even the possibility of something else occurring.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「だに」 is used in formal writing and speech to express that something, merely by its existence or consideration, evokes a strong feeling or result. It can be translated as \"just,\" \"(not) even,\" or \"merely.\" It often emphasizes the extremity of a situation. It is frequently used with verbs expressing thought or emotion. 「だにしない」 is a common negative form, indicating that something is not even considered or done. It adds a sense of complete absence or disregard.",

            "setting": "humorous",
            "nuance": "Here, 「だに」 emphasizes the speaker's fear about their body fat percentage, making the mere thought of it frightening. 「恐ろしい」is often used to exaggerate one's worries. The overall formal tone creates a humorous contrast with the everyday concern of body fat.",
