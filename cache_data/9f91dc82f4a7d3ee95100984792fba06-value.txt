  "writeup": "The verb 見える, pronounced \"mieru\" (見える), means \"to be visible,\" \"to seem,\" or \"to be in sight.\"  It's an intransitive verb, meaning the subject experiences the action rather than performing it.  The thing being seen is marked with the particle が.  However, how something appears is indicated adverbially—い-adjectives take the く form, while な-adjectives and nouns are followed by に.  For example,  \"That mountain looks far away\" would be あの山は遠くに見える.  This highlights a key difference from 見られる (the potential form of 見る), which implies an active attempt to see something, whereas 見える suggests visibility is unavoidable if one looks in the right direction.  Interestingly, 見える can also refer to the sense of sight itself, indicating whether anything is visible at all.",
