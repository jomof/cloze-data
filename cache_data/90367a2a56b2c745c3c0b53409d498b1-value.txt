    "etymology": "The word 「時 (とき)」 literally means \"time.\" When used as a conjunction, it indicates the specific time or occasion when something occurs.",
    "writeup": "「とき」 (時 in kanji) is a noun that functions as a conjunction to mean \"when\" or \"at the time of.\" It's used to describe actions or states that occur at specific times or during certain events. Unlike some other time expressions, 「とき」 often describes things that happen regularly or during broad periods or single events, such as 「雨が降る**とき**」 (when it rains) or 「店のセール**のとき**」 (when there is a sale at the shop).\n\nTo use 「とき」, attach it to the end of a verb (in plain form), an い-adjective, or a noun. Remember to add 「な」 after な-adjectives and 「の」 after nouns. The particle 「に」 often follows 「とき」, especially when another verb follows soon after, indicating the time something happened.",
