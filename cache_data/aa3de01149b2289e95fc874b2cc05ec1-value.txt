    "etymology": "The grammar point derives from the adverbial particle 「こそ」, used for emphasis, combined with archaic realis forms of verbs such as 「すれ」 (する, to do), 「あれ」 (ある, to be), and 「なれ」 (なる, to become). This construction creates a strong contrast, emphasizing what is *not* the case.",
    "writeup": "The 「こそすれ〜ない」 grammar point is a formal expression used to emphasize that while something might be true to a certain extent, the opposite or a negative consequence is definitely not the case. It often appears in response to a perceived misunderstanding or to correct someone's assumption. 「こそ」 acts as an emphasizing particle, while 「すれ」, 「あれ」, and 「なれ」 are archaic forms of the verbs 「する」, 「ある」, and 「なる」, respectively.\n\nThis grammar point typically takes one of these forms:\n\n*   **Noun/Verb + こそ + すれ/あれ/なれ + Negative Consequence**\n*   **Adjective + こそ + あれ/なれ + Negative Consequence**\n*   **する-verb stem + こそ + すれ + Negative Consequence**\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This grammar point has a formal register and is mainly found in written or formal speech.\n*   The \"B\" phrase will include a negative statement.\n*   Pay attention to the verb stem being used, as auxiliary verbs can be attached before the 「こそする」 construction.",
