    "etymology": "The word ずっと originally means \"unwavering\" or \"unfaltering.\" This conveys the sense of something continuing without change or interruption. It's derived from the verb 「続く」(tsuzuku), meaning \"to continue.\"",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「ずっと」 has the primary meaning of indicating that something continues in a constant state, without stopping or resting. It can also emphasize the duration or extent of something. Think of it as 'all throughout' or 'the whole time.' 「ずっと」is added to the beginning of the phrase to highlight its ongoing nature or duration.\n\nIt can also be used after 「から」(kara) to express that something has been continuing \"ever since\" a specific event or point in time. Because it literally implies 'unwavering,' using 「ずっと」 will often be perceived as implying 'far more' or 'to the maximum amount possible.'",
