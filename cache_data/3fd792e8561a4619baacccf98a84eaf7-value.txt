    "etymology": "「だった」 is the past tense, plain form of the copula 「だ」.  「だ」 itself originates from the particle 「と」 and the verb 「ある」 (to be). Over time, 「とある」 contracted to 「たる」 and then to the modern 「だ」. The past tense form 「だった」 is formed by attaching the past tense auxiliary verb 「た」 to 「だ」. 「でした」 is the polite past tense form of the copula 「です」. 「です」 is considered a polite form of 「だ」.  The past tense 「でした」 is created by changing the 「す」 of 「です」 to 「し」 and adding 「た」.",
    "writeup": "「だった」 and 「でした」 are used to express the past tense of nouns and な-adjectives. Think of them as the Japanese equivalent of \"was\" or \"were.\"  「だった」 is the casual form, while 「でした」 is the polite form.  You attach these to the end of a noun or a な-adjective's stem (without the 「な」).  For example, 「きれい」 (pretty) becomes 「きれいだった」 or 「きれいでした」.  Remember, **importantly**, you cannot use 「だった」 or 「でした」 with い-adjectives; they have their own past tense forms.",
