    "writeup": "The passive voice in Japanese is formed using the auxiliary verbs **れる** and **られる**.  This grammar point indicates that the subject of the sentence is the recipient of an action, often implying a lack of control or even negative feelings about the action.  Unlike English, where the passive voice is a distinct verb form, in Japanese, it's created with these auxiliary verbs.\n\nTo form the passive voice:\n\n*   For **う-verbs** (godan verbs), change the final う sound to its corresponding あ sound and add **れる**. For example, 読む (yomu) becomes 読まれる (yomareru).\n*   For **る-verbs** (ichidan verbs), simply add **られる** after removing the final る. For example, 食べる (taberu) becomes 食べられる (taberareru).\n*   The irregular verb **する** becomes **される**.\n*   The irregular verb **くる** becomes **こられる**.\n\nThe person performing the action is typically marked with the particle **に**, but **から** can also be used when there is no direct physical contact.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Multiple meanings of られる:** Be aware that **られる** can also express potential, spontaneous actions, and respect. The context is crucial for understanding the intended meaning.\n*   **Focus on Lack of Control:** The passive voice in Japanese often emphasizes the subject's lack of agency.\n*   **ラ抜き言葉 (Ra-nuki kotoba):**  The omission of ら in **られる** to form **れる** is common, especially when expressing potential. However, in the passive, spontaneous, or respectful meanings, retaining the ら is generally preferred for clarity.",
