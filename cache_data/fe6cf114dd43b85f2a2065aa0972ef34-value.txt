  "writeup": "それぞれ (sorezore) is a Japanese noun that functions similarly to the English word 'each'.  It's used to refer to individual items or people within a group, emphasizing their separate or distinct characteristics.  Unlike some adverbs, それぞれ typically precedes the entire clause or phrase it modifies, or a noun modified by の (no).  This noun can also be used adverbially.  Its versatility makes it useful in a wide range of contexts, from casual conversation to more formal situations.  An interesting etymological note: それぞれ shares its kanji origins with 其 (sono), a demonstrative pronoun meaning 'that' (near the listener).  This connection suggests a literal meaning akin to 'that and that,' which evolved to the broader sense of 'each' or 'respectively'.",
  "etymology": "The word それぞれ derives from the combination of the word 其 (その, sono), meaning 'that', repeated twice.  Originally indicating 'that one and that one,' it evolved to convey the meaning of 'each' or 'respectively,' reflecting a shift from specific reference to a more general distributive sense.",
