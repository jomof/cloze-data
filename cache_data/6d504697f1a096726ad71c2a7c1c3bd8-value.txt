  "writeup": "など is an adverbial particle used to express that something is presented as an example, but that other things in the same category also exist.  It's commonly translated as 'such as,' 'things like,' or 'and so on.'  It follows nouns, indicating that the preceding noun is one example from a larger group.  The kanji form, 等, is frequently used and emphasizes this belonging to a broader set.  Interestingly, the same kanji is part of the pluralizing suffix ら, highlighting the connection between  etc. and plurality.  While often interchangeable with なんか, など maintains a more formal tone and is less colloquial. なんか lacks the kanji form 等.  In essence, など showcases a representative item while implying a wider range of similar items.",
  "etymology": "The kanji 等 (tō) means 'equal,' 'same,' or 'alike.' This reflects its grammatical function of presenting something as a representative member of a group of similar things. Its connection to the plural marker ら further solidifies this sense of belonging to a larger category.",
