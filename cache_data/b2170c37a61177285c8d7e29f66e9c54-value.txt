  "writeup": "The verb 込む (komu), meaning 'to jam into,' acts as a versatile suffix in Japanese, enriching the meaning of other verbs.  While literally meaning 'to cram into' or 'to jam into', it's often used to convey a sense of thoroughness, intensity, or immersion.  We'll focus on its nuances suggesting 'remaining in a state,' 'doing something deeply,' or 'doing something intensely.'  It's attached to the stem of other verbs, adding depth to the base action. Think of it as 'jamming oneself into' a situation or activity. This grammar point is used across all genders and ages and across all regions of Japan.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of 込む (komu) is rooted in the image of something being forcefully inserted or packed into a space.  The inherent sense of being fully enveloped is what allows the word to convey intensity and depth of action or state. The 'ko' part likely shares an origin with words indicating closeness, while 'mu' suggests the action of entering or packing.",
