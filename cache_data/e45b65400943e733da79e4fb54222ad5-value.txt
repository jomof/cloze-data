  "writeup": "向け (muke) means \"intended for,\" \"aimed at,\" or \"designed for.\" It's a shortened form of the verb 向ける (mukeru, to aim or direct), functioning as a suffix attached to nouns.  It indicates the target audience or purpose of something.  While something described as  \"X 向け\" is intended for X, it doesn't strictly exclude other users.  Think of it as a primary target, not an absolute limitation.  For example, a \"children's book\" (子供向けの本) might also be enjoyed by adults. However, the nuance shifts when considering products;  here, 向け strongly implies specific design considerations for the target audience. This contrasts with 向き (muki), derived from the intransitive verb 向く (muiku, to face or be suitable), which describes suitability or orientation without necessarily implying intentional design.",
  "etymology": "向け (muke) is a relatively modern word, a shortened form of the verb 向ける (mukeru), meaning 'to direct' or 'to aim.'  Its usage as a suffix reflects the modern tendency in Japanese to create concise and expressive compound words.",
