    "etymology": "This grammar point stems from the formal copula 「である」. 「であれ」 is derived from the imperative form of 「ある」 (the verb component of 「である」). When used in the 「〜であれ〜であれ」 structure, it emphasizes that the result or conclusion remains unchanged, irrespective of the options presented.",
    "writeup": "The construction 「であれ〜であれ」 is a formal expression used to indicate that something is true regardless of which of two options is the case. It's similar to saying \"whether... or...\" or \"in either case\" in English. It emphasizes that the outcome remains the same no matter which option is chosen. This pattern is often used in formal writing or speech when making an objective statement that holds true under different conditions.\n\n*   The phrase is derived from 「である」, which is a polite way of saying 「だ」 (is).\n*   「であれ」 is the imperative form of the verb 「ある」.\n*   It is often used with nouns or phrases that fall into the same category.",
