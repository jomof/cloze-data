  "writeup": "The suffix げ, sometimes written in kanji as 気, adds a nuanced layer to Japanese expressions.  It conveys the sense that something is 'giving off the feeling of (A)' or 'seems like (A)', often concerning emotions or situations where the speaker lacks absolute certainty.  Unlike そう, which indicates a more objective observation, げ suggests a subjective interpretation based on the speaker's impression. It's a subtle but powerful way to show uncertainty or a degree of hesitancy in stating a fact. Importantly, げ typically follows the stem form of い-adjectives and can also attach to the stems of nouns or な-adjectives, creating a new な-adjective. This results in the word being followed by な or に depending on what comes next in the sentence. The overall impression is one of low-confidence, less certain than そう. This low-confidence is likely a legacy from the original meaning of 気, which is ‘attention’—the speaker is paying attention to the feeling, whether or not it reflects the true state of affairs.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of げ traces back to the kanji 気 (ki), meaning 'air,' 'spirit,' 'feeling,' or 'atmosphere.'  Its usage in this grammatical suffix reflects a subtle sense of atmosphere or impression, rather than a definitive statement.",
