    "writeup": "**単に (tanni)** means \"simply,\" \"merely,\" \"only,\" or \"just.\" It is used to indicate that something is nothing more than what is being stated and to downplay its significance. 「単に」 often appears with 「だけ」 or 「に過ぎない」 to emphasize this limitation. It's a versatile word that can be used in a variety of contexts, from explaining a simple reason to dismissing a complex issue.",
    "etymology": "The word 「単に」 comes from 「単 (tan)」 meaning \"single\" or \"simple,\" and 「に (ni)」, a particle that often turns nouns into adverbs. Therefore, 「単に」 literally means \"in a simple manner\" or \"simply.\"",
