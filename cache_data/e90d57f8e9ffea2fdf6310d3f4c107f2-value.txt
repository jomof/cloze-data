    "writeup": "Unlike the ままに that is partnered with passive structures like れる and られる \"to do as one is told\", when paired with verbs in their standard forms, ままに means \"to do (A) as one wishes\", or \"to do (A) on a whim\". ままに is a combination of the noun まま \"as is\", and the case marking particle に. ままに will follow verbs in their dictionary form.\n\nIn many cases, this use of ままに indicates that the speaker or doer is letting the action of (A) happen in whatever way is most natural, and is not making any particular effort to control the outcome. Due to this, there are only a limited number of verbs that are commonly used with ままに, and it is best not to attempt to use combinations that you have not come across before.\n\nSome standard sequences are **気の向くままに** \"in whatever way my attention is inclined\", **思うままに** \"in whatever way I think up\", **思いつくままに** \"in whatever way I come up with\", **足の向くままに** \"in whatever direction my feet are pointed\", **赴くままに** \"in whatever way it proceeds\", **欲するままに** \"in whatever way is desired\", and **風の吹くままに** \"in whatever way the wind blows\".",
