  "writeup": "This grammar point focuses on い-adjectives used as predicates.  A predicate describes the subject or topic of a sentence.  In Japanese, this is called a 述語 (shusgo), literally 'statement word'.  い-adjectives, in their predicate form, can stand alone, implying the subject from context, or follow a subject marker (は or が).  The choice between は and が depends heavily on context. Generally, が emphasizes the specific instance being described as different from other things in the same category.  For example, using が in \"お風呂が熱い\" highlights that this *particular* bath is exceptionally hot.  Using は would feel less natural, as it doesn't emphasize the unusual hotness.  All い-adjectives are natively Japanese words, reflecting the richness of the language.",
  "etymology": "The term \"い-adjective\" comes from the fact that these adjectives typically end in the sound \"i\" in their dictionary form.  Their grammatical function as predicates is a core part of Japanese sentence structure, reflecting the language's agglutinative nature.",
