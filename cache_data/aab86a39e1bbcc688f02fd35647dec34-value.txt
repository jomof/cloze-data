    "writeup": "The grammar point **にまつわる** is derived from the verb **纏(まつ)わる** which means \"to coil around\" or \"to be entwined.\"  As a grammar pattern, **にまつわる** is used to indicate that something is broadly about or connected to a specific topic. It follows a noun and acts like an adjective, modifying the noun that comes after it.  It often conveys a sense of something being related to the background, history, or stories surrounding the preceding noun.  Think of it as something that \"coils around\" a central theme.  This pattern is generally considered formal and is frequently used in written materials or more serious conversations.  You'll often see it used when discussing tales, stories, legends, myths, or information related to a particular subject.  For instance, you might talk about 「歴史**にまつわる**話」(a story related to history) or 「事件**にまつわる**情報」(information connected to an incident).",
