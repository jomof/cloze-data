  "writeup": "どうやら, meaning \"apparently,\" \"looks like,\" or \"seems like,\" is a versatile adverb often used alongside other expressions of speculation such as ようだ, そうだ, and らしい.  However, unlike these, どうやら doesn't simply state a guess; it *strengthens* the uncertainty, conveying a sense of tentative deduction. Think of it as adding a nuance of 'in some way it seems like...' to the statement.  Like many adverbs of speculation, it typically leads the sentence, modifying the entire clause. Interestingly, despite its adverbial function, どうやら originates from a combination of どう ('how') and やら, a particle indicating uncertainty. This etymology reveals a subtle difference from other similar expressions—it suggests a more hesitant and less direct assertion than, say, らしい.",
  "etymology": "どうやら is a combination of the interrogative adverb どう (dō, 'how') and the particle やら (yara), which expresses uncertainty or indefiniteness.  The combination suggests a tentative or uncertain conclusion drawn from observation.",
