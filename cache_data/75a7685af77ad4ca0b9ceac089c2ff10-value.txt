    "etymology": "The verb 「はじめる」 (hajimeru) comes from the noun 「はじめ」 (hajime), meaning \"beginning\" or \"start.\" The verb form evolved to describe the act of initiating something. The kanji form, 「始める」, reflects this meaning with the combination of 「女」 (woman) and 「台」 (platform), suggesting the setting in motion of something new.",
    "writeup": "To express that actions are beginning, the verb 「はじめる」 (hajimeru, to commence) is used. To say that (A) is starting/beginning, attach 「はじめる」 to the ます stem of almost any verb. Whether you use the hiragana form, or the kanji form does not matter, as there will be no change in nuance.\n\nSince 「はじめる」 is itself a verb, the tense can be changed to show that something will start, is starting, or has started. For example:\n*   「はじめる」 - to start (present/future)\n*   「はじめます」 - to start (polite present/future)\n*   「はじめた」 - started (past)\n*   「はじめました」 - started (polite past)\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   It can be easy to accidentally use 「始まる」 (はじまる), the intransitive form of this verb. However, with this expression, the transitive form will always be used, due to the verb that 「はじめる」 is attached to being the thing that 'is started', by 'something' else.",
