    "etymology": "The term 「ずくめ」 originates from the suffix 「尽(つ)く」, meaning \"completely\" or \"using solely\", combined with 「め」. The spelling was standardized to 「ずくめ」 after post-WWII script reforms.",
    "writeup": "「ずくめ」 is attached directly to nouns to express that something is entirely comprised of that noun, to the exclusion of anything else.  It conveys the idea of \"completely (A)\", \"all in (A)\", or \"nothing but (A)\". When 「ずくめ」 directly modifies another noun, the particle 「の」 is inserted between them. While the older form 「づくめ」 exists, 「ずくめ」 is the standard modern usage.  It can be used in both positive and negative contexts, but is frequently found in set expressions.  It's **important** to familiarize yourself with common combinations. For example, 「黒ずくめ」 (all in black) is a frequently encountered phrase.",
