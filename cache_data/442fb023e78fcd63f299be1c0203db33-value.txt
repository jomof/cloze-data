  "writeup": "The particle わ, as you know, is an adverbial particle used for emphasis and stress.  When used twice consecutively, as in わ〜わで, it typically implies two negative factors leading to a negative outcome or opinion.  It's often translated as \"with (A) and (B), (C)\". The structure is simple: place わ after a word (verb, い-adjective, な-adjective, or noun in its standard form – using だわ for な-adjectives and nouns), repeat after a second (different) word, and finally add the case-marking particle で, indicating \"because of\" or \"due to\".  The で is sometimes omitted.  わ〜わで emphasizes the speaker's surprise and frustration.  Unlike the similar わ construction that repeats the same verb to denote excess, わ〜わで lists separate frustrating elements.  This structure is mainly used by men, though women may occasionally use it.  Note that various forms of わ exist, each with nuanced gender usage that requires further study.  This structure functions similarly to し〜し, listing reasons for a consequence, but with a much stronger, irritated, and surprised tone.  While almost exclusively used with negative connotations, it can, exceptionally rarely, have a positive nuance.",
