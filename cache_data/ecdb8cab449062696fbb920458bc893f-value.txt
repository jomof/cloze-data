  "grammar_point": "たまえ",
  "conjugations": [],
  "jlpt": "N2",
  "meaning": "(Please) do!, Ask to, Beg to, (Order somebody to do something)",

  },
  "writeup": "The imperative form たまえ, derived from the u-verb 給う (kiku) meaning \"to give\" or \"to bestow,\" is attached to the masu-stem of verbs to create a formal command.  It's often translated as \"please do (A),\" but this politeness is deceptive.  Tamae is used only by someone of significantly higher status than the recipient, primarily men.  This hierarchical relationship must be clearly established within the context, such as between a boss and a subordinate.  Historically, たまえ was sometimes used to request favors or in prayers, but this usage is now largely confined to literature. The formality is extremely rigid, making it unsuitable for casual conversation or relationships of equals.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "まあまあ、とりあえず座り**たまえ**。",
      "english": "Well, please, take a seat.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The phrase 「まあまあ」 softens the command slightly, but the overall tone remains formal.  The use of たまえ implies a certain level of authority from the speaker to the listener."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "何か言いたそうな顔をしている君！考えてる事を言い**たまえ**！",
      "english": "You look like you want to say something! Please, tell me what you're thinking!",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 君 (kimi) is slightly informal, creating a tension between the formal たまえ and the less formal address. This dynamic highlights the speaker's authority despite the seemingly friendly tone. 「考えてる事を言いたまえ」 is a direct order, despite the 'please'."

    {
      "japanese": "遠慮せずどんどん食べ**たまえ**。",
      "english": "Please eat as much as you want without holding back.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "While encouraging, the command is still formal due to the use of たまえ, which again implies a social hierarchy where the speaker is the superior."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "我らに罪をおかす者を、我らがゆるすごとく、我らの罪をもゆるし**たまえ**。",
      "english": "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "religious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This example demonstrates the historical use of たまえ in a prayer, showcasing a supplicant addressing a higher power. The formality emphasizes reverence. 「ゆるしたまえ」 is an entreaty, not a request."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "勉強をやり**たまえ**。",
      "english": "Study!",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "commanding",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a direct command, demonstrating the bossy nature of たまえ.  The lack of additional softening words makes it a blunt instruction. 「勉強をやりたまえ」 is a very blunt order."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "何かを実行する前にまず少し考え**たまえ**！",
      "english": "Think a little before you act!",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "commanding",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a forceful order delivered with an air of authority, characteristic of たまえ.  The imperative mood is strong and leaves no room for negotiation. 「考えたまえ」 is a firm imperative."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "これを、明日までに終え**たまえ**。",
      "english": "Finish this by tomorrow.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "commanding",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a clear and direct instruction from a superior to a subordinate, clearly showing the power dynamic through the use of たまえ. 「終えたまえ」 is a forceful instruction, typical of a boss-employee setting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "お前にうんざりだ！うちの会社をとっとと辞め**たまえ**！",
      "english": "I'm fed up with you! Get out of my company!",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "commanding",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The harshness of 「辞めたまえ」 emphasizes the speaker's anger and authority.  This shows that tamae is not suitable for any kind of friendly exchange."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "次の人、入り**たまえ**。",
      "english": "Next person, come in.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "commanding",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a brisk and formal command often heard in official settings. This implies a structured environment and the use of たまえ reinforces the speaker's authority. 「入りたまえ」 is a brief, direct order."

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the nuance of たまえ hinges entirely on the pre-existing power dynamic.  Using it inappropriately can be incredibly offensive.",

      "term": "な",
      "meaning": "Do not, Don't (Prohibitive)",
      "kind": "antonym",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, carefully consider the intended outcome.  If you want to order someone to do something, use たまえ (in appropriate contexts). If you want to stop them from doing it, use な.  The difference is crucial and reflects a deep cultural understanding of hierarchy and politeness."
