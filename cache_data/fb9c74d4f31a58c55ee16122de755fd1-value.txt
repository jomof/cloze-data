    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たがる」 is formed by attaching the suffix 「がる」 to the たい-form of a verb. 「たい」 expresses one's own desire, while 「がる」 is a suffix that indicates the speaker's observation or feeling that someone else is exhibiting a certain emotion or desire. Thus, 「たがる」 indicates that a third person seems to want to do something.",
    "writeup": "As we explored previously, the verb suffix 「がる」 can be used with i-adjectives to express someone's feelings or outward display of those feelings.  When combined with the auxiliary verb 「たい」 (want to do), it forms 「たがる」. This grammar construction expresses that a third person acts as if they want to do something. To form this, attach 「たい」 to the ます-stem of a verb, then replace the 「い」 of 「たい」 with 「がる」. It's **important** to distinguish 「たがる」 from 「てほしい」, which means \"to want someone to do (A)\".  Practice and memorization are key to mastering these differences.  Also, remember the difference between 「たがる」 (want to *do* something) and 「ほしいがる」 (acting like they want something). To describe that someone seems like they want an object, you would pair 「がる」 with the 「ほしい」 adjective.",
