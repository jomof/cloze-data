    "writeup": "To express that something 'was' a certain way in the past in Japanese, you use **だった** (casual) or **でした** (polite). These are attached to the end of a noun or a な-adjective.  It's a combination of the auxiliary verb **だ** (or **です** in its polite form) with the past tense marker **た**. For **だった**, the base form of **だ** becomes **だっ** and **た** is added. For **でした**, the **す** of **です** changes to **し** before adding **た**.  **Important consideration:** Remember that い-adjectives have their own past tense conjugations and cannot be used with **だった** or **でした**.",
