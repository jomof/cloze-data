  "writeup": "たところで (ta tokoro de) is a grammatical construction expressing the futility or lack of effect of a preceding action, even if it's taken.  It combines the past-tense form of a verb (た -ta), the noun ところ (tokoro, 'place, point'), and the particle で (de, indicating a circumstantial condition).  The overall meaning is often akin to the English expressions \"even if... it won't change anything,\" \"even if... it makes no difference,\" or \"no matter how much... it's useless.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* The sentence structure typically presents two contrasting clauses: The first clause describes an action that might seem relevant; the second clause states that its outcome is ultimately irrelevant or ineffective. This always involves a negative implication in the second clause.  This is precisely why the first part is frequently in the past tense; the event has already occurred in the speaker's mind.\n* The nuance isn't strictly about time. While it uses the past tense, it's not necessarily about a past event.  It often refers to a hypothetical action in the present or future. This construction often expresses resignation or frustration over a situation that's beyond the speaker's control.\n* This construction is commonly used in situations emphasizing the speaker's frustration or resignation.  Words such as 今さら (imasara, 'now that it's too late'), いくら (ikura, 'no matter how much'), or どんなに (donnani, 'no matter how') often precede the first clause to intensify this sentiment. \n* Etymology:  ところ (tokoro) originates from the concept of a 'place' or 'point' in time or space. The past tense form sets the stage for a consideration that lacks consequence.",
