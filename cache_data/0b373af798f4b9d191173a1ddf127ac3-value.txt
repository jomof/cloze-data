  "etymology": "The past tense suffix '-かった' is derived from the verb 'く' (ku) meaning 'to become' and the past tense marker 'た' (ta).  The 'っ' (tsu) represents a sound change that frequently occurs between certain sounds in Japanese.",
  "writeup": "This grammar point focuses on forming the past tense of い-adjectives.  These adjectives, describing states or qualities, differ from な-adjectives in their conjugation.  To create the past tense, we replace the final '-い' with '-かった' for the plain form and '-かったです' for the polite form.  Remember that い-adjectives do not use 'だ' in the past tense, unlike nouns or な-adjectives.  The polite form, while widely accepted, isn't strictly grammatically correct in formal academic settings, but it's perfectly acceptable in almost all daily conversations.",
