  "writeup": "The particle はじめ (hajime) means \"beginning\" or \"start.\"  When used as はじめ, it indicates something is being presented as a starting point, often implying further elements or progressions.  This is frequently translated as \"not only… but also…\" or \"starting with…\".  The structure emphasizes the initial item, highlighting it as the beginning of a series.  The noun preceding はじめ is the focus, often suggesting an order or sequence.  For stronger emphasis, phrases like として (toshite) or とする (tosuru), translating to \"as,\" \"regarding,\" or \"treating as,\" can be added, clarifying the initial noun as the starting point. This usage is common in both spoken and written Japanese, spanning various registers.",
  "etymology": "はじめ (hajime) originates from the verb はじめる (hajimeru), meaning \"to begin\" or \"to start.\"  The particle はじめ is a nominalized form of this verb, specifically its dictionary form.",
