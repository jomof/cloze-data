  "writeup": "Derived from the verb 責める (semeru), meaning \"to blame\" or \"to hold responsible,\" せめて (semete) is an adverb that sets a minimum standard or expectation.  It doesn't simply mean a minimum quantity; it implies a responsibility or obligation to meet that minimum.  Think of it as expressing the least acceptable action in a given situation, often implying a sense of slight disappointment or dissatisfaction that more wasn't done.  It's frequently used at the beginning of a sentence and modifies the entire clause that follows.  The nuance of responsibility is key—it's not just about the quantity, but about fulfilling a duty or expectation, however minimal.",
  "etymology": "せめて (semete) originates from the verb 責める (semeru), meaning \"to blame\" or \"to hold responsible.\"  The nuance of responsibility carries over into the adverbial use.  The implication isn't simply 'at least this much,' but rather, 'at least this much is expected of you.'",
