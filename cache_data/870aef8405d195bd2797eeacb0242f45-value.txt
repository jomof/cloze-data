  "writeup": "けれども (keredomo) is a formal conjunctive particle, functioning similarly to けど (kedo), but with a more refined and polite tone. While both convey the meaning of 'but' or 'however,' けれども often implies a more nuanced sense of 'although' or even 'despite the fact that.'  It suggests a contrast between two clauses, but with a subtle emphasis on the second clause.  The sentence structure often emphasizes the importance or weight of the statement following けれども.  Think of it as a more formal, considerate way of expressing a contrast.  This particle is suitable for most formal contexts, but might sound slightly stiff in extremely casual conversation.  The choice between けれども and けど often depends on the desired level of formality and the relationship between speakers.  A spectrum of 'but' particles exists in Japanese, ranging from casual (けど) to very formal (が).",
  "etymology": "けれども's etymology is fascinating.  While often considered a more formal counterpart to けど, its origins are rooted in a now-archaic grammatical structure.  It's related to the particle が (ga), which acts as a subject marker but can also imply contrast. けれども likely evolved from a structure emphasizing the contrast, retaining a degree of the formality associated with が, thus providing a more nuanced and polite way to express contrast.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "もう晩ご飯を食べた**けれども**、まだお腹が空いています。",
      "english": "I already ate dinner, but I'm still hungry.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "casual",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a plain form of the past tense for \"ate\", showing a casual tone.  The speaker is comfortable enough with the listener to state their hunger despite having just eaten."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "宿題は終わらせた**けれども**、まだ確認が必要です。",
      "english": "I finished my homework, but I still need to check it.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "academic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of \"finished\" in the past tense and the formal \"necessary\" in the following clause creates a semi-formal tone appropriate for an academic context."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "会議は長かった**けれども**、生産的な議論ができました。",
      "english": "The meeting was long, but we had a productive discussion.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formality of the sentence comes from using \"was long\" and \"productive discussion\", along with the inherent formality of けれども.  This is fitting for a professional setting, such as a workplace meeting debrief."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "今日は疲れている**けれども**、あなたと話をしたいです。",
      "english": "I'm tired today, but I want to talk to you.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「です」 and the direct expression of desire \"I want to talk to you\" create a gentle, slightly flirtatious tone.  The use of 「けれども」 adds a touch of vulnerability, enhancing the flirtatious vibe. 「あなたと話をしたいです」is a common polite expression of interest."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "明日は忙しい**けれども**、少しの時間ならあなたと会えますよ。",
      "english": "I'm busy tomorrow, but I can meet you for a little while.",

      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The speaker is suggesting a meet-up despite being busy, signaling interest without being overbearing. The use of 「よ」 adds a hint of casualness, making it appropriate for an early relationship where formality is not fully established yet.  The phrase 「少しの時間なら」softs the \"busy\" statement."

    {
      "japanese": "素敵なレストランを知っている**けれども**、予約が難しいかもしれません。",
      "english": "I know a great restaurant, but getting a reservation might be difficult.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence displays an informative tone; The speaker is sharing information while also offering a caveat to the listener. The formal register is due to the use of けれども and more formal vocabulary like 「素敵なレストラン」."

      "term": "が (subject marker)",

      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike けれども, が is a much more versatile particle, primarily functioning as a subject marker. While it can sometimes indicate contrast, it lacks the nuance of 'although' or 'despite' that けれども carries.  It's generally less formal."

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "Choosing the appropriate 'but' particle depends heavily on context and formality.  Consider the overall tone and relationship between speakers to avoid sounding unnatural.  While these particles share overlapping meanings, their subtle differences in nuance and register must be carefully considered for effective communication."
