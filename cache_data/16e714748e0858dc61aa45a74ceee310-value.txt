  "writeup": "思うように (omou you ni) is a common Japanese expression conveying the sense of something happening 'as one hopes,' 'as desired,' or 'to one's liking.'  It's a combination of the verb 思う (omou, to think, to hope) and the form ように (you ni), which indicates a manner or way.  The structure typically involves an initial clause describing an expectation followed by 思うように and a concluding clause detailing the outcome. This outcome can be positive (meeting expectations) or negative (falling short of expectations).  The nuance depends heavily on context.  For example, \"うまくいくように\" suggests a positive hope for success, while  \"思うようにいかない\" describes a frustrating lack of progress. Mastering this phrase involves understanding how context shapes its meaning.  Note that while grammatically versatile, it’s generally used in standard speech and writing.",
  "etymology": "The phrase is a straightforward combination of the verb 思う (omou), meaning 'to think' or 'to hope,' and the adverbial form ように (you ni), meaning 'in the way that,' 'as,' or 'like.' The combination creates a natural and idiomatic expression indicating conformity or non-conformity to one's expectations.",

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of \"楽しかったよ\" (it was fun) softens the negative aspect of the first part of the sentence, making it suitable for a casual first date. 「よ」is a common sentence ending for males in casual settings."

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「よ」 (yo) at the end makes this more casual and flirty. The compliment preceding the sentence creates a positive and flirtatious tone.  The female speaker uses a casual tone to express her feelings towards the male listener, adding to the flirty dynamic.  The implication is that her expectation of being moved was surpassed.  The use of \"まるで天使のよう\" is also a hyperbole commonly used in flirting."
