    "writeup": "**まで** is a particle that roughly means \"as far as (A),\" or \"until the point of (A).\" When used with verbs, it is often translated as \"until (A) happens.\"  Because **まで** means \"as far as/until the point of,\" it is typically used with verbs in the **non-past tense**. The completion of the action is often implied or stated later in the sentence.

When used with a place, **まで** functions similarly to **に**, indicating that someone or something will go *to* that place, but no further.

**Important Consideration:**

While English often uses the past tense in the \"until\" clause (e.g., \"until the class *started* \"), Japanese uses the non-past tense with **まで** (e.g., 授業が始まるまで). The past tense of the overall action is conveyed through other verbs in the sentence.",
