  "writeup": "まくる is a verb that, when attached to the conjunctive form of other verbs, emphasizes the repetitive or vigorous nature of the action.  It originates from the verb 捲る (maku, u-verb meaning 'to roll' or 'to turn'), thus implying the repeated action is done 'all around' or 'over and over'.  Common translations include \"to (A) like crazy,\" \"to do nothing but (A),\" and \"to constantly do (A).\"  It attaches to the conjunctive form (て-form) of other verbs and can be used in both positive and negative contexts. The nuance often suggests recklessness or abandon; the subject acts repeatedly without much thought to consequences. **Important Consideration:** The verb to which まくる is attached must be volitional—something the subject can control and repeat.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of まくる lies in its connection to the verb 捲る (maku), meaning \"to roll up,\" \"to turn over,\" or \"to unfurl.\"  This root meaning explains the sense of repeated, extensive, or energetic action implied by まくる. The repeated, rolling action of the original verb is extended to describe the repeated nature of the action of the verb it modifies.",

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the nuance of recklessness or abandon shifts depending on the context. While buying lures or singing karaoke might be seen as harmless, constantly eating sweets suggests a lack of self-control.  The choice of verb significantly impacts the overall meaning.",
