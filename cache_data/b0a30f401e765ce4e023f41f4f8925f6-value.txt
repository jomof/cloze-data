  "writeup": "The adverbial particle しか is often compared to だけ, as both express 'only'. However, unlike だけ, しか can only be used in negative statements.  Therefore, しか～ない is regularly translated as 'there's only (A)' or 'there's nothing but (A)'.  しか～ない can express numbers or nouns; this lesson focuses on nouns.  When used before a noun, it indicates that nothing else exists besides that one thing. Any verb may follow しか, but it must be in its negative form (ない or ありません).  Important Consideration: When しかない directly follows a verb, the translation subtly shifts to mean 'nothing but (A) can be done'. This is a separate grammar point.",

    {
      "term": "ばかり",
      "nuance": "While ばかり also means 'only' or 'nothing but', it often implies a repetitive or excessive action and carries a slightly negative connotation, unlike the more neutral しか～ない."

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that しか～ない always appears in negative sentences and expresses a limitation or lack of alternatives.  だけ is used positively, and ばかり suggests repetition or excess." ,
  "etymology": "The particle しか originates from the ancient word 許か (sika), meaning 'only' or 'as much as'.  Its use in negative constructions developed over time, reflecting the evolving nuances of expressing limitations in Japanese."
