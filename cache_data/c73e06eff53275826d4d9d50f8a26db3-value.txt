    "etymology": "These words are shortened forms of より (yori) + the demonstratives: それ (sore, that near you), これ (kore, this near me), あれ (are, that over there), and どれ (dore, which). Thus: そのような (sono you na) > そんな (sonna), このような (kono you na) > こんな (konna), あのような (ano you na) > あんな (anna), and どのような (dono you na) > どんな (donna).",
    "writeup": "The expressions 「そんな」, 「こんな」, 「あんな」, and 「どんな」 are commonly used to indicate something is \"like\" something else. They are abbreviations of the more formal 「そのような」, 「このような」, 「あのような」, and 「どのような」, respectively.  They directly precede the noun being described or inquired about. Using the longer, more formal versions may be appropriate in situations calling for increased politeness.\n\n*   「そんな」 refers to something \"like that\" near the listener or previously mentioned.\n*   「こんな」 refers to something \"like this\" near the speaker.\n*   「あんな」 refers to something \"like that\" over there, away from both the speaker and the listener.\n*   「どんな」 asks \"what kind of\" something.",
