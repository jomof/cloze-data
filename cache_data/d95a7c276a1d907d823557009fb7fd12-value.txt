  "writeup": "This grammar point uses the particle か to embed a question within a larger sentence.  It's crucial to understand that this isn't simply adding a question to the end; it's about expressing uncertainty or seeking information *about* the embedded question.  Think of it as asking 'Is it the case that...?'.  The nuance differs significantly from simply appending a question-marking particle like か at the sentence's end.  Unlike a direct question, this structure allows for embedding the question into a statement, creating a more natural flow in conversation. For example, asking \"Do you know if X?\" is more natural using this か than asking \"Xか？\"  Note that you should never attach だ or です to the noun or な-adjective immediately preceding this か. This is a key difference from other uses of か.",
  "etymology": "The particle か itself has a long history, stemming from interrogative roots in ancient Japanese.  Its use as an embedded question marker represents a natural evolution, reflecting how Japanese speakers prefer nuanced and context-dependent ways to express uncertainty.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "忘年会に社長が来るか分かりますか？",
      "english": "Do you know if the CEO is coming to the year-end party?",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a polite question, suitable for a formal setting like asking a colleague about an office event. The use of 「分かりますか？」 shows deference and respect."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "これで足りるか分かる？",
      "english": "Do you think this is enough?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a casual question, suitable for asking a friend or family member in a less formal setting. The use of 「分かる？」 is informal and implies familiarity. 「足りるか」 directly expresses uncertainty on whether something is enough."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼が誰のことを好きかわかりません。",
      "english": "I don't know who he likes.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the negative form 「分かりません」to express uncertainty. The use of 「誰のことを好きか」 is grammatically correct and shows a natural and fluid way to embed a question."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あのね、私、君のこと、好きかも…分かる？",
      "english": "Hey, um, I might like you... Do you know?",
      "register": "shitashii kuchō",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "This flirty sentence uses 「あのね」and 「かも…」to soften the confession.  The 「分かる？」 at the end invites a response and lightens the mood. The use of 「私」 by a female speaker is normal."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "明日、一緒に映画を見に行くか、どう思う？",
      "english": "What do you think about going to see a movie together tomorrow?",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses 「どう思う？」 as a softer way to ask the question rather than the more direct 「行くか？」  This approach is common in first-meeting contexts, allowing the other person to express their feelings without pressure."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼がどのくらいの時間、ここにいるか、確認できますか？",
      "english": "Could you verify how long he'll be here?",
      "register": "teineigo",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite phrasing 「確認できますか？」 and the use of  「どのくらいの時間」 show respect for the listener and the formality of the situation. The embedded question is presented politely in the professional context."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the key is to choose the appropriate level of formality for your context.  Practice using this structure in various situations to build fluency and naturalness.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "かどうか",
      "meaning": "Whether or not, If...or not",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike か, which implies seeking information about an uncertain situation, かどうか explicitly asks about the yes/no aspect of the question itself. It's a more formal and direct way to ask a question."
    },
    {
      "term": "か (question marker)",
      "meaning": "Or; (Question marker)",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "The sentence-ending か is a direct question, while embedded か seeks information *about* a question.  The sentence-ending one requires a direct answer; the embedded one does not.  Don’t confuse the two."
    },
    {
      "term": "か〜ないかのうちに",
      "meaning": "Right after, As soon as, Just when, Barely",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "This phrase indicates an action happening immediately after another.  It's entirely different from embedding a question to convey uncertainty."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the purpose. か (embedded) is for indicating uncertainty and seeking information about an embedded question.  かどうか is for direct yes/no questions.  か〜ないかのうちに expresses timing. Choosing the right particle depends on whether you're asking a direct question, seeking information about an uncertain situation, or describing the timing of events."
