  "writeup": "The potential form, using れる/られる, indicates ability or possibility.  It's crucial to understand that this expresses *potential* rather than inherent capability.  This subtle distinction is important; it suggests an action is possible under certain circumstances, not a guaranteed skill.  られる attaches to the stem of -る verbs; れる is used with other verb types.  Both れる and られる conjugate like regular る-verbs, allowing for past, negative, and polite forms.  While informal speech might omit the ら (ラ抜き言葉), this isn't grammatically correct and can lead to ambiguity, especially when distinguishing potential from passive voice.  Interestingly, する verbs use できる instead of a potential form.  Note that both  ことができる and  られる express the same nuance, but ごとができます is often viewed as slightly more polite.  A fun detail:  both を and が can mark the object with potential forms, except for できる, which only uses が.",
  "etymology": "The potential form's etymology traces back to a combination of the verb stem and the auxiliary verb expressing possibility.  The 'ra' sound in られる is a phonetic shift stemming from older grammatical structures.",
