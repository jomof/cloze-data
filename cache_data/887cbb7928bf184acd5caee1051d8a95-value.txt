  "pronunciation": {
    "katakana": "イウマデモナイ",
    "romaji": "iu made mo nai"
  },
  "formation": {
    "言う + までも + ない": "The phrase combines the verb 言う (to say), the adverbial particles まで (even) and も (also/too), and the negative adjective ない (not)."
  },
  "etymology": "The phrase's structure highlights the emphatic negation of the need to say something.  '言う' (iu - to say) is the core, modified by 'まで' (made - even, up to), and 'も' (mo - also, even), culminating in the negative 'ない' (nai - not).  This layering emphasizes the obviousness of the omitted statement.",
  "writeup": "Unlike \"は言うまでもない\", which typically follows other phrases, \"言うまでもない\" usually leads the sentence.  It's a structure combining the verb \"言う\" (iu - to say), the adverbial particles \"まで\" (made - even) and \"も\" (mo - also), and the i-adjective \"ない\" (nai - not).  This translates as \"it goes without saying that (A)\", or \"it's needless to say (A)\", where (A) is the subsequent clause.  \"言うまでもない\" is frequently followed by \"ことだが\", \"が\", \"けど\", and similar expressions, adding a \"but\" nuance.  This is a polite way to indicate something's obviousness without sounding arrogant. The use of までも emphasizes the comprehensiveness of the obviousness;  it's not just unnecessary to state it, but it's so obvious that stating it would be redundant even to the highest degree.",
