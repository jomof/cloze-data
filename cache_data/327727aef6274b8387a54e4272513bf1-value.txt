    "etymology": "The word 「手前」 originally referred to the area in front of one's body or workspace, a meaning it still retains. Over time, it expanded to include the sense of \"in one's presence\" or \"from one's perspective.\"",
    "writeup": "The noun 「手前」, meaning \"in front of,\" has several different meanings in Japanese depending on whether it is used with a verb in its dictionary form or with a noun. Regarding verbs, it expresses \"going forward from (A), (B).\" This is usually in relation to something that has happened either accidentally or completely, and may represent what will be done as a result of being in that situation. This can also be interpreted as \"now that (A), (B),\" and simply highlights that nothing can be done except to move on or \"forward\" given the current circumstances.\n\nWhen 「手前」 appears with nouns followed by the case-marking particle 「の」, it often expresses that what is \"in front\" of (A) is the reason for (B), or simply is \"in front of (B).\"\n\nDespite the many translations, 「手前」 always shows something that is \"facing\" the noun or verb that appears with it. Due to this, thinking of this structure as similar to \"faced with (A), (B)\" may be helpful, as English also expresses a lack of options and finality in this way.",
