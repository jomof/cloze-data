  "writeup": "The particle せいで (seide) is a versatile grammar point used to express the cause or reason for a negative outcome.  It's built from the noun せい (sei), meaning 'cause' or 'doing,' and the particle で (de), indicating means or instrumentality.  While often translated as 'because of' or 'due to,' せいで carries a subtle connotation of fault or blame, implying that the cause is undesirable.  The structure is generally [reason] + せいで + [negative consequence]. Note that the particle で is sometimes omitted at the end of a sentence, especially in casual speech.  The word せい itself is derived from the kanji 所為 (shoi), literally meaning 'doings' or 'actions,' which highlights the causative nature of this grammatical structure.  This is a key distinction from similar expressions such as おかげで (okage de), which expresses gratitude for a positive outcome. Let's delve into its nuances through examples.",
  "etymology": "The word せい (sei) originates from the kanji 所為 (shoi), meaning \"doings\" or \"actions.\"  This etymology is crucial to understanding the particle's implication of causality and, often, negative consequence. The inherent sense of 'fault' or 'blame' associated with せいで stems directly from this root.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "昨日夜遅くまで起きていた**せいで**寝坊した。",
      "english": "I overslept because I stayed up late last night.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence is a simple, straightforward explanation, suitable for casual conversation.  The speaker is not placing blame on anyone, merely explaining a factual circumstance. 「夜遅くまで起きていた」 (staying up late) is the cause of the undesirable consequence, 「寝坊した」 (overslept)."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "外が寒い**せいで**風邪を引いた。",
      "english": "I caught a cold because it was cold outside.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Similar to the previous example, this sentence uses せいで to explain an undesirable event. The coldness of the weather 「外が寒い」 (it's cold outside) is presented as the reason for catching a cold 「風邪を引いた」 (caught a cold)."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の不注意な運転**せいで**事故を起こしてしまった。",
      "english": "I got into an accident because of his careless driving.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence subtly implies blame on the other driver.  The phrase 「彼の不注意な運転」 (his careless driving) clearly indicates the fault lies with him. Using せいで here, rather than a more neutral phrasing, reinforces the negative impact of his actions."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "雨のせいで、せっかくのデートが台無しになった。",
      "english": "Our date was ruined because of the rain.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "melancholic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a casual expression of disappointment.  The speaker is not explicitly blaming the rain, but the use of せいで highlights the unfortunate impact on the event.  The focus is on the negative consequence, 「せっかくのデートが台無しになった」 (the perfectly planned date was ruined)."

    {
      "japanese": "あなたのせいで、プロジェクトが遅れている。",
      "english": "The project is behind schedule because of you.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "condescending",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a more formal and direct expression of blame.  The phrase 「あなたのせいで」 (because of you) directly points the finger at the listener. The formal register is used to emphasize the seriousness of the delay.  The use of せいで strengthens the accusatory tone."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の遅刻のせいで、会議は開始時刻を大幅に遅れた。",
      "english": "The meeting started late because he was late.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence is a factual statement in a formal setting.  While there is a subtle implication of blame toward the latecomer, the focus remains on the delayed meeting.  The formal tone of 「会議は開始時刻を大幅に遅れた」 (the meeting started significantly late) is maintained.  The use of せいで simply expresses causality."

      "japanese": "彼の怠慢のせいで、会社に大きな損失が出た。",
      "english": "The company suffered a huge loss due to his negligence.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "In this formal context, せいで emphasizes the severe negative consequence of the man's actions.  The seriousness of the situation is underscored by the use of 「大きな損失」 (huge loss). The formal language and use of せいで convey the gravity of his negligence.  The phrasing 「彼の怠慢のせいで」 (because of his negligence) directly attributes the blame."

        {
      "japanese": "こんなに素敵なあなたと出会えたのは、運命のせいかしら？",
      "english": "Is it fate that I met someone as wonderful as you?",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses せい in a playful and suggestive way, creating a flirty innuendo.  The question mark and the phrase 「こんなに素敵なあなた」 (such a wonderful you) convey the speaker's affection.  The use of 「かしら？」 (kashira?) is a feminine sentence-ending particle that adds a touch of coquettishness."

  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the nuance of blame shifts depending on the context and the surrounding vocabulary.  While always signifying a negative consequence, the degree of implied fault is adjustable.  Pay close attention to the context in which you use this particle.",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the emotional weight you want to convey.  If expressing gratitude, use おかげで. If merely stating a reason without blame, use ために or そのために. If expressing a cause with a strong implication of fault or undesirable consequence, use せいで.  The formality of the situation will also guide your choice; つきに is best reserved for formal contexts."
