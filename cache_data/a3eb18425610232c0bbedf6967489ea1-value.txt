    "etymology": "The expression 「もしかしたら」 is derived from 「若し(もし)」 (if), 「か」 (question particle), and 「する」 (to do), often in the form 「したら」. It literally translates to something akin to \"if it happens to be the case that...\"",
    "writeup": "「もしかしたら」 functions as an adverb to introduce a hypothetical situation and its potential outcome. It is commonly translated as \"perhaps,\" \"maybe,\" or \"possibly.\" Typically appearing at the beginning of a sentence, it often pairs with 「かもしれない」 to express uncertainty, though this is not mandatory. The tense is primarily determined by the subsequent statement, not by 「もしかしたら」 itself.",

            "setting": "friendly",
            "nuance": "「もしかすると」 sounds slightly more formal than 「もしかしたら」. Using 「ちゃん」 is casual and indicates affection or familiarity, so it is out of place when speaking to someone older or more senior.",
