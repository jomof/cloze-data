    "etymology": "The verb 「過ぎる (すぎる)」 means 'to pass; to exceed'. When attached to the ます-stem of verbs or the stem form of adjectives, it retains the sense of exceeding a limit, thus indicating 'too much' or 'excessively'.",
    "writeup": "「すぎる」 is a verb meaning \"to exceed\" or \"to go past\". When attached to other words, it expresses that something is \"too much\". It can be joined to the ます-stem of verbs, the stem form of い-adjectives (remove the い), or the stem form of な-adjectives (remove the な). \n\nIn casual speech, the 「る」 is often omitted, resulting in 「すぎ」. This variation can be used with any word that 「すぎる」 would typically be used with.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   When 「すぎる」 is used with 「ない」, the 「い」 changes to 「さ」, creating 「なさすぎる」, which means \"not enough (A)\". As with regular 「ない」 forms, 「では」 or 「じゃ」 is required after な-adjectives.\n*   When used with 「いい」 to mean \"too good\", remember that the stem form of 「いい」 is 「よ」, so 「よすぎる」 is correct, while 「いすぎる」 is not.\n*   「すぎる」 itself is a verb, so it can be conjugated into negative forms. Pay attention to the placement of 「ない」 to understand the meaning.",
