    "etymology": "「もう」'mou' originally meant 'again' or 'further,' but its meaning evolved to encompass the idea of something being completed or no longer continuing. It carries the nuance of something having reached its end or limit, whether in the sense of 'already' done or 'no longer' happening.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「もう」 is commonly translated as \"already\" or \"anymore,\" depending on the sentence's context. It expresses that something has unexpectedly ended or reached its limit. When used with a past affirmative verb, it means \"already.\" When used with a negative verb, it means \"anymore.\"  It contrasts with 「まだ」, which means \"still\" or \"not yet.\" 「もう」 can also express exasperation, indicating someone has reached a point of not wanting to continue.",
