    "etymology": "The etymology of 易(やす)い stems from the verb 易(やす)らぐ (yasuragu), meaning \"to feel at ease, to be relieved.\" This suggests a sense of comfort and lack of difficulty associated with actions described by this grammar point.",
    "writeup": "The い-adjective 易(やす)い attaches to the ます-stem of verbs to indicate that something is **easy to do**.  Think of the ます-stem as the noun form of the verb. While 易(やす)い is written with kanji, it's often seen in hiragana.  Be careful not to confuse it with 安(やす)い, which means \"cheap.\"  While 易(やす)い is technically an い-adjective, it's rarely used alone. For \"easy\" in general, use the な-adjective 簡単(かんたん).",
