    "etymology": "The word 「ため」 itself is a noun meaning \"sake,\" \"purpose,\" or \"benefit.\" The addition of 「に」 often clarifies the direction or purpose, similar to \"for the sake of.\" The kanji 「為」 is often used, reinforcing the sense of purpose.",
    "writeup": "「ため」 (or 為 in kanji) is a noun that closely translates to \"sake\" or \"purpose\" in English. It's classified as a semi-independent word, requiring connection to another word to specify the \"sake\" being highlighted. The particle 「に」 is often added as 「ために」, indicating that something is done to achieve a goal (A). Thus, 「ために」 can mean \"for the sake of (A)\" or \"in order to (A).\"\n\n*   It connects to verbs in their dictionary form or nouns followed by 「の」.  For adjectives, use the informal form followed by 「ため」. \n\n*   While primarily indicating goals, 「ため」 also highlights past events and their results, translating as \"due to\" or \"because of\" in such cases. In essence, 「ため」 means \"in light of (A),\" signifying that (A) is the main reason for (B).",
