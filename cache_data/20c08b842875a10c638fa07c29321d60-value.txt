    "etymology": "The 「て」 form indicates a connection or sequence, while 「いる」 signifies existence or a continuing state. Combined, they describe something that continues from a past action to the present.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「ている」, indicates a **resultant state**. This means something has happened, and its effect continues to exist. It describes something that *has* been done and is *still* in that state. It's crucial to differentiate this from the 「ている」 form that indicates an ongoing action. This form highlights the *current state* resulting from a completed action, rather than the action itself. It's similar to the English past perfect tense, but it focuses on the resulting condition.",
