  "writeup": "The grammar point 甲斐がある (kai ga aru) literally translates to \"there is worth.\"  It expresses the idea that something was or will be worthwhile, or that an effort has or will have a positive result.  The word 甲斐 (kai) means 'worth,' 'effect,' or 'reward.'  The verb ある (aru) means 'to exist' or 'to be.'  The particle が (ga) marks 甲斐 as the subject.  This construction is often used to reflect on past efforts or to anticipate the value of future endeavors.  While the structure is generally straightforward, understanding the nuances of its usage within different contexts is key to fluency.  Note that the negative form, 甲斐がない (kai ga nai), means 'it's not worthwhile' or 'it doesn't pay off.'",
