    "etymology": "「とか」 is derived from the particle 「と」 (to), which indicates a listing of items, and 「か」 (ka), which adds uncertainty or acts as a question marker, giving the sense of \"and so on\" or \"among other things.\"",
    "writeup": "「とか〜とか」 is used to list items non-exhaustively, implying there are more unlisted items of the same kind. It can follow nouns, verbs, or even clauses. The final 「とか」 is often omitted. It indicates that the listed items are examples from a larger category. It's crucial to remember that 「とか」 suggests the speaker is providing examples and not a complete list. Unlike 「や」, 「とか」 can be used with verbs.",
