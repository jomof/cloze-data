    "etymology": "The suffix 「ぐるみ」 stems from the verb 「包む」(つつむ), meaning \"to wrap\" or \"to encompass.\"",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「ぐるみ」, often followed by the particle 「で」, attaches to nouns to express the idea of \"including everything related to\" that noun, or \"across the entire\" entity. Think of it as meaning \"whole\", \"-wide\", or \"entire\". It emphasizes that something is happening with all members or aspects of a group or entity. While 「で」 is common, you might also see 「の」 when it modifies another noun. 「ぐるみ」 is frequently used with words that denote a collective unit, like family, company, or town, highlighting the shared involvement or characteristic of the entire group rather than focusing on individuals.",
