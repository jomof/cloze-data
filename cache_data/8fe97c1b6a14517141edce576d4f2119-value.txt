    "etymology": "さ is believed to have originated from the sentence-ending particle さ, which adds a slight emphasis or confirmation-seeking tone. Over time, it evolved into a filler word used to bridge gaps in speech.",
    "writeup": "The interjection さ has several uses, including inviting attention, expressing surprise, or controlling the flow of conversation. This entry focuses on its use as a filler word, similar to \"like,\" \"you know,\" or \"uhh\" in English. It's used when the speaker is searching for the right words or simply needs thinking time. This さ can appear anywhere in a sentence and doesn't necessarily indicate confusion, but rather signals that the speaker hasn't finished speaking. It is primarily used in casual speech (タメ語).",
