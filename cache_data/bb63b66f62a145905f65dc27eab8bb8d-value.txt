    "etymology": "「もしも」 is derived from 「もし」 (if) combined with the particle 「も」 (even), intensifying the sense of conditionality or possibility. 「なら」 and 「でも」 are conditional conjunctions; 「なら」 implies a more direct consequence, while 「でも」 suggests 'even if' or 'despite'.",
    "writeup": "「もしも」 is an adverb that strengthens the meaning of 「もし」, indicating 'even a bit'. It is almost exclusively used with expressions that present a hypothesis, such as 「ば」, 「と」, 「なら」, or 「ても」. Therefore, 「もしも」 is often translated as \"supposing that.\" It sets up a hypothetical situation where (B) will happen if (A) is true.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   「もしも」 focuses on a potential result based on a condition. Contrast this with 「たとえ」, which focuses on a contrastive situation regardless of the outcome.\n*   「もし」 and 「もしも」 are largely interchangeable, but 「もしも」 adds more emphasis to the hypothetical nature.",
