    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たがる」 is formed by attaching 「がる」 to the たい-form of a verb. 「たい」 expresses one's own desire, and 「がる」 adds the nuance of expressing or showing that feeling externally. Therefore, 「たがる」 describes someone else exhibiting a desire to do something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「たがる」 is used to express that a third person (someone other than the speaker) **acts like they want to do something**. It's crucial to remember that you **cannot** use 「たがる」 to describe your own desires.  You learned about 「がる」 to express how someone seems to feel an emotion (e.g., 怖がる - to act scared). 「たがる」 extends this to desires. To form 「たがる」, take the たい-form of a verb (expressing desire) and change the い to がる. For example, 食べたい (want to eat) becomes 食べたがる (acts like they want to eat). Keep in mind the difference between 「たがる」 and 「てほしい」, which means \"to want someone to do (A)\". 「たがる」 describes someone's apparent desire, while 「てほしい」 is your direct request or wish for someone else's action. Similarly, be careful not to confuse 「たがる」 with the い-adjective 「ほしい」 (to want something).  To express that someone appears to want an object, you would use 「ほしがる」.",
