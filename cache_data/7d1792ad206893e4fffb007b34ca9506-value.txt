    "etymology": "で is derived from the continuative (te-form) of the copula だ (da). Its use to indicate means or location likely evolved from its function to specify a state or condition in which an action occurs.",
    "writeup": "で is a particle with several uses, but its core function involves highlighting something essential for performing an action or achieving a goal. It often translates to \"by\" or \"with\" in English, indicating the means, method, or instrument used to perform an action. For example, バス**で**行く (basu de iku) means \"I go by bus,\" where the bus is the means of transportation. Unlike と, which can also mean \"with,\" で emphasizes the tool or method used. It can also be used to indicate language used (日本語**で**話す - nihongo de hanasu - speak in Japanese), cost (100円**で**買った - hyaku en de katta - bought for 100 yen), or duration (一日**で**終わった - ichinichi de owatta - finished in one day).",
