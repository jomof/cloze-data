    "etymology": "ぐるみ stems from the verb 包む (tsutsumu), meaning \"to wrap\" or \"to encompass.\"",
    "writeup": "ぐるみで (gurumi de) is used to express that something encompasses absolutely all of a group or entity. It means \"including (A),\" \"all over (A),\" or \"(A) wide.\" The term ぐるみ stems from the う-Verb 包む (tsutsumu), meaning \"to wrap\" or \"to encompass.\"\n\nIn many cases, the case-marking particle で (de) will follow ぐるみ to mark \"with,\" but の (no) may also be seen when preceding a second noun. ぐるみ is most frequently seen following words that specify a whole \"group\" or \"span\" to which the topic of the sentence is only one part of. This could be one member of a family, one home within a neighborhood, one student within a school, or any other number of things that share a clearly identifiable link.\n\nDespite this, the primary nuance will always be that the group itself shares a common trait, rather than focusing on any individual part.",
