    "etymology": "どれ is part of the 「こそあど言葉」 (kosoado kotoba) system of Japanese demonstratives. The 'do-' series indicates an interrogative, asking 'which one?' It is related to words like これ (this), それ (that), and あれ (that over there), but instead of pointing to a specific item, it asks to identify one from a group.",
    "writeup": "どれ is part of the same family of words as これ, それ, and あれ. These words are called 「こそあど言葉」 (kosoado kotoba) in Japanese. Unlike the other three, which all point to a specific thing, words starting with 「ど」 (do) are designed for enquiring about something unknown. どれ can be translated as \"which\" in English, and is used for enquiring about a group (of three or more things). The particle 「が」 (ga) is often used with どれ, especially in questions. However, when どれ follows a noun, 「は」 (wa) will be used. When there are only two choices, どちら + の or どっち + の will be used instead of どれ. This distinction has evolved as part of the language over time.",
