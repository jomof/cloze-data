  "writeup": "ましょう, a polite volitional form, is derived from the auxiliary verb ます.  It's commonly used to suggest an action be done jointly, often translated as 'Let's...' or 'Shall we...?'.  Its formation is simple: replace the ます ending of a verb with ましょう. However,  it's crucial to understand that while often translated as a question ('Shall we?'),  ましょう can also function as a statement of intent, emphasizing the speaker's own volition.  Think of it as a more polite and softer version of the plain volitional form よう. The nuance shifts depending on context; a suggestion to a close friend might feel different than a suggestion to a superior.",
  "etymology": "ましょう is the polite volitional form of the verb ます.  The ます itself originates from the archaic verb ます which meant 'to honor' or 'to revere'. The volitional form adds the nuance of deliberate action and intention, resulting in the suggestion or proposal inherent in ましょう.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to differentiating these similar expressions lies in understanding the level of formality and the nuance of the speaker's intention.  ましょう is a polite volitional form;  ～よう is casual,  ませんか is a polite question, and ～ましょうか is a more humble, polite suggestion."
