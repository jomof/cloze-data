    "etymology": "「ところ」 means 'place' or 'situation.' In this construction, it indicates the 'situation' or 'point in time' just before an action occurs. 「だった」 is the past form of 「だ」 (to be), indicating that the situation was about to happen but did not.",
    "writeup": "「ところだった」 indicates that something was **on the verge of happening but ultimately did not**. It expresses a near-miss situation. Think of it as \"was just about to\" or \"almost did.\" The verb preceding 「ところだった」 is in its dictionary form, indicating the action that was narrowly avoided. It can also be used with the negative form of a verb + 「ところだった」, meaning something was about *not* to happen, but then did.",

            "nuance": "「もう少しで」 (mou sukoshi de) means 'just a little more' or 'almost'. It enhances the sense of being on the verge of something. The 「だ」at the end is often omitted in casual speech. This phrase is common in romantic scenarios.",
            "etymology": "「告白」 (kokuhaku) is a Sino-Japanese word, meaning 'confession' or 'declaration.' 「する」 (suru) turns it into a verb, 'to confess'."
