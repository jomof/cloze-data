    "etymology": "The past tense form of い-adjectives is created by conjugating the adjective itself. The 'い' ending is dropped and replaced with 'かった' for the plain past form, and 'かったです' for the polite past form. This is similar to how verbs conjugate in Japanese to indicate tense.",
    "writeup": "To create the past form of い-adjectives, you must conjugate the adjective. This is done by removing the い and replacing it with かった to make the plain past form. To create the polite past form, add です to かった. For example, 楽しい (tanoshii - fun) becomes 楽しかった (tanoshikatta - was fun) and 楽しかったです (tanoshikatta desu - was fun). While adding です after かった is widely accepted as polite, it's academically considered less correct, though its common usage makes it suitable for almost any situation.",
