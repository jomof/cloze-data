    "writeup": "とっくに is an adverb that means \"long ago\" or \"already.\" It's an emphasized version of 疾(と)うに, a literary form not often used in modern Japanese. とっくに is a sentence adverb, so it usually appears at the beginning of sentences or before the verb it modifies. Compared to すでに and もう, とっくに indicates something that happened much further in the past or is used for exaggeration. It is uncommon to see とっくに used with a specific time, because the stem word 疾(と)し already suggests \"far earlier\".",
    "etymology": "とっくに is derived from the archaic adverb 疾(と)うに (tou ni), meaning \"already\" or \"long ago\". The \"っく\" sound is an intensifier, emphasizing the feeling of the action having occurred a while ago.",
