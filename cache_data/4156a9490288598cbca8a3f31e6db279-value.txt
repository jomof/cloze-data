    "etymology": "「てくる」 is formed by combining the te-form of a verb with the verb 「来る (くる)」, which means \"to come.\" The te-form indicates a process or state that leads to the action of \"coming.\" This combination creates the nuance of something progressing or developing toward the present.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point combines the 「て」-form of a verb with the verb 「来る (くる)」, meaning \"to come.\" The core meaning implies something is moving towards the speaker, either physically or temporally. It indicates a change that started in the past and continues into the present. \n\nKey nuances:\n\n*   **Directional**: Indicates something coming toward the speaker, whether literally or figuratively. Think of 「持ってくる (motte kuru)」, "to bring."\n*   **Temporal Progression**: Describes a change that has been happening and continues to happen. The nuance is similar to \"has come to be\" or \"has become.\" For example, 「だんだん暖かくなってきた (dandan atatakaku natte kita)」 means \"it has gradually become warmer\".\n*   **Return**: Can indicate returning from somewhere after doing something, such as 「トイレに行ってきます (toire ni itte kimasu)」, meaning \"I'm going to the bathroom and coming back.\"\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   This grammar point focuses on the **process** of something becoming. If you wish to describe the state after the change, you may want to use 「～になる」or 「～くなる」.\n*   Be mindful of the context to differentiate between physical movement and temporal change.",
