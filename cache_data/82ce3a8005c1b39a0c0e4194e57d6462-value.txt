  "writeup": "だに is an adverbial particle that shares a similar meaning to さえ and すら 'even,' but is more commonly found in classical literature. It's paired with negative structures and presents 'minimum' or 'light' examples to which (A) doesn't apply, and therefore obviously doesn't apply to anything greater than (A).  It translates as 'not even (A), so not (B),' or 'not (B) at all.' だに follows nouns or noun phrases. Although だに often appears when (B) is negative, だに itself isn't limited to this. When following verbs, and (B) isn't negative, だに simply means 'just.'  Remember, the core meaning is always to mark the preceding word or phrase as an extremely small amount or lower limit. **Caution:** だに is rarely used in modern Japanese, primarily in set expressions like 夢にだに 'even in a dream,' 想像するだに 'even to imagine,' 考えるだに 'even to consider,' 聞く だに 'even hearing,' 微動だに 'not even a quiver'.",
  "etymology": "The particle だに likely originates from a combination of the demonstrative pronoun だ (that) and the particle に, which in this context adds an intensifying or emphatic nuance.  Its use in expressing minimal amounts or degrees highlights its historical roots in emphasizing a small quantity or action.",

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice the variations in sentence structure and the use of other intensifying words, such as 「少しも」 and 「夢にも」 to amplify the core meaning of だにしない.  The examples illustrate its use in both casual and formal speech, demonstrating its adaptability within different contexts.  Its rarity in modern spoken Japanese makes its correct usage crucial for conveying nuance.  Focus on the situations where a strong emphasis on the unexpected nature of the event is necessary.  This nuance is vital for achieving the 'not even' meaning instead of simply 'didn't'.",
