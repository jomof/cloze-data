  "writeup": "The grammar point \"ことに\" (koto ni) intensifies the preceding adjective or verb, emphasizing the extent of a feeling or emotion.  It's often translated as \"extremely,\" \"especially,\" or \"to my (surprise/delight/etc.).\"  It's crucial to understand that its intensifying effect is primarily tied to emotional states.  You won't typically see it used with descriptions of purely objective situations.  The structure is usually '(adjective/verb) + ことに + (main clause).'  For instance, \"幸せなことに (shiawase na koto ni)\" means \"happily,\" \"to my happiness,\" or \"fortunately.\"  The nuance shifts subtly depending on context.  The expression \"幸いなことに (saikina koto ni)\" — \"fortunately\" or \"luckily\" — exemplifies its common usage.  While it can sometimes appear before the descriptive element, this usage is less common and relates etymologically to the kanji 殊, functioning adverbially much like 特に (toku ni).",
  "etymology": "The word こと (koto) means 'thing' or 'matter.'  The particle に marks the topic or reason. The combination highlights that a particular 'thing' or state of affairs is especially significant due to the feeling it evokes.",

The speaker is male, and uses a more dramatic phrasing that's often seen in romantic settings."
