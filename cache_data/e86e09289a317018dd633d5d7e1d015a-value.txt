  "writeup": "The grammar point \"ていく\" combines the conjunctive particle \"て\" with the verb \"いく\" (to go).  It describes an action continuing into the future, often implying a progression or journey.  Think of it as \"to go on to do [action]\" in English, emphasizing a process unfolding and continuing.  The tense of \"いく\" determines the overall tense of the expression.  The past tense suggests a completed process, while the present indicates something about to happen or already in progress. This differs significantly from \"てくる,\" which describes an action approaching or reaching the speaker.  While both can be used to show action progression, the subtle distinction lies in whether the speaker is experiencing the progression (てくる) or the progression is continuing away from the speaker (ていく).",
