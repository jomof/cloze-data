    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed by combining the te-form of the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 (ない -> なくて) with the grammar point 「もいい」 (it's okay to do something). Therefore, 「なくてもいい」 literally means \"it's okay even if (something) is not done.\"",
    "writeup": "「なくてもいい」 expresses that something is not necessary or required. It conveys the nuance that it's 'okay even if (A) is not done.' This grammar point often comes across as polite, and in English, it sounds like \"don't worry about doing (A)\". It's a combination of the auxiliary verb 「ない」 in its te-form, 「なくて」, with 「もいい」. In casual speech, the particle 「も」 can be omitted, making it sound more friendly. This omission does not change the meaning.",
