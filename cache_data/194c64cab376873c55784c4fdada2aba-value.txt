  "writeup": "からする is a slightly formal Japanese grammar pattern used after a number or counter to indicate a minimum estimate.  It's often translated as 'about (A)', '(A) or more', or 'starting at (A)'. This structure combines the particle から ('from') and the verb する ('to do').  It literally means 'starting from (A),' emphasizing the speaker's uncertainty about the exact amount.  からする is typically used with larger numbers, highlighting the inexactness of the figure. Using it with small numbers might sound unnatural.  While similar in meaning, からの is often used with people or general amounts, not frequently with money, unlike からする. For weight, size, or distance, からある is more common. Note that からする and からの are both used primarily in formal settings.  Mastering these subtle distinctions is key to sounding natural in your Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of からする is straightforward.  から is a particle indicating 'from' or a starting point, while する is a versatile verb meaning 'to do' or, in this context, 'to start from'. The combination creates a nuanced expression of estimation.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "その靴、買ったの？それって１５万**からする**やつでしょ？やばいね。",
      "english": "You bought those shoes? Those cost 150,000 yen or more, right? That's crazy!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「やばいね」 makes this a casual conversation between friends, despite the use of the more formal \"からする\". The sentence is simple and directly expresses surprise."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この辺だと家賃は１５万**からする**。",
      "english": "Rent around here starts at 150,000 yen.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence is concise and factual, suitable for a semi-formal setting where providing information is the goal.  The use of からする indicates a minimum estimate rather than a precise figure."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "父から３００万円**からする**時計をもらった。",
      "english": "I received a watch from my father, costing 3,000,000 yen or more.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "storytelling",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence is suitable for recounting a story with a slightly formal tone. The focus is on the value of the gift, and the use of からする adds an element of emphasis."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この商品の製造には、１億**からする**お金がかかる。",
      "english": "Manufacturing this product will cost 100 million yen or more.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence is appropriate for a formal business setting.  The precise cost isn't known, but the minimum is emphasized.  The formal register aligns with the use of からする."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "昨日の大地震で、１０人**からする**人が行方不明になった。",
      "english": "The large earthquake yesterday left 10 or more people missing.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "news report",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence is direct and avoids colloquialisms. The formal tone is suitable for reporting news; it focuses on the facts and avoids speculation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたと一緒なら、１００万**からする**幸せを感じられるわ。",
      "english": "With you, I feel a happiness that starts at a million.",
      "register": "intimate",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses hyperbole and a slightly exaggerated tone to convey romantic interest, using 「あなたと一緒なら」 and 「幸せ」 to create a feeling of intimacy, and using からする to emphasize the depth of feeling. The speaker's gender is important here because it changes the meaning, and the way this is phrased is something a female would typically say. The listener's gender is less crucial here."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "君の笑顔を見たら、僕の心は１０００倍**からする**速さでドキドキするんだ。",
      "english": "When I see your smile, my heart beats at a speed of over 1000 times.",
      "register": "intimate",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses hyperbole and a playful tone to express romantic interest.  The use of 「君の笑顔」 and 「ドキドキする」 contributes to the romantic and somewhat clumsy expression of feelings, and the male speaker uses  the intimate からする to emphasize how strong his feeling is. The speaker's gender is important because males are more likely to use this type of wording."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the naturalness of からする depends heavily on context and the number used.  Avoid using it with small numbers unless you're aiming for a specific, somewhat humorous effect.  Practicing with various sentence structures will help you master its nuances.",
