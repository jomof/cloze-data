    "etymology": "「みたい」is considered to be an abbreviation of the phrase 「を見たような」 (o mita yō na), which literally translates to \"like (something) that one has seen.\" This etymology highlights the visual or experiential basis for the judgement or comparison made using 「みたい」.",
    "writeup": "「みたい」 is used to express that something resembles something else or to convey a sense of 'it seems like.' It is less formal than 「ようだ」and more commonly used in conversational settings. 「みたい」can follow nouns, verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and even full sentences. When used at the end of a sentence, it's often followed by 「だ」 or 「です」, though this can be omitted in casual speech. To modify a noun, 「みたいな」 is used.\n\n*   **Resemblance:** Expresses that something is similar to a noun (e.g., 'like a bear').\n*   **Conjecture:** Expresses an impression or conjecture based on appearance or indirect information (e.g., 'it seems like it will rain').\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   「みたい」 is generally based on direct or reliable information. While indicating a resemblance, it shouldn't be confused with 「見たい」 ('to want to see').\n*   The nuance is less formal than 「ようだ」.",
