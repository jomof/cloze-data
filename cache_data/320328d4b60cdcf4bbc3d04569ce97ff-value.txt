    "etymology": "The structure \"かれ〜かれ\" is derived from the conjunctive stem of い-adjectives (く) combined with the imperative form of the verb 「ある」 (to be), which is 「あれ」. The contraction 「かれ」 evolved from 「くあれ」, effectively meaning \"be it (A) or (B)\". Because it is imperative, it is a declarative expression.",
    "writeup": "「かれ〜かれ」 is a grammar pattern used to pair opposite い-adjectives in Japanese, conveying that \"whether (A) or (B), the result will be the same.\" It is usually translated as \"or\" or \"either (A) or (B).\" Originally, this structure was a contraction of the conjunctive stem of い-adjectives, 「く」, and the imperative form of the verb 「ある」, 「あれ」. Because い-adjectives do not have their own imperative form, 「くあれ」 and then the abbreviation 「かれ」 evolved to fill this role.\n\nAs it is imperative, the literal meaning is simply \"be it (A) or (B)\", and functions as a declaration. 「かれ〜かれ」 will attach to the stem of 2 adjectives that are antonyms, before going on to explain how the result remains the same regardless.\n\n「かれ〜かれ」 is used with a very limited set of adjectives, so it is best not to use it with words that you have not come across previously.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   In the case of 「良い」 (good) and 「悪い」 (bad), 「悪い」 will be read as 「悪しかれ」, which comes from the archaic 「悪し」 (bad). This is considered as set phrase in modern Japanese.",
