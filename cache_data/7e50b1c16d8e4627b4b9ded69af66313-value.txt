    "etymology": "「っこない」 is a combination of 「〜っ子」, a suffix often attached to nouns (especially to describe children or things that are small and cute, derived from 「子」 meaning \"child\"), and 「ない」, the negative form of the verb 「ある」 (to exist). Here, 「〜っ子」 adds emphasis to the impossibility of something, making it sound absolutely certain.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「っこない」 attaches to the conjunctive form (ます-stem) of verbs to express the impossibility of something happening. It conveys a strong sense of \"there is no way\" or \"absolutely impossible.\" The 「〜っこ」 part originates from 「〜っ子」 which can mean child, so this grammar point can be written in kanji 「〜っ子ない」, but this is very rare. \n\n",
