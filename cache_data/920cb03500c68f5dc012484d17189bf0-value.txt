  "writeup": "The particle も (mo) is a versatile element in Japanese grammar, capable of conveying a range of meanings including 'also,' 'too,' 'as well,' 'even,' 'either,' and 'neither.'  Its translation hinges on whether the sentence is affirmative or negative, a common characteristic of Japanese particles.  Unlike English, which employs distinct words like 'either/neither' for negative contexts and 'too/also' for affirmative ones, Japanese uses も seamlessly in both.  Think of it as signifying: 'Whatever is true for (A), is also true for (B).'  This simple structure belies its depth; も participates in numerous compound grammar points, subtly shifting its nuance while retaining its core meaning.  For instance, consider でも (demo, 'but also'), にも～ない (nimo~nai, 'neither...nor'), and とも (tomo, 'both...and').  The frequent pairing of も with other particles is a key feature, enhancing its expressive capacity. Note the use of も with で, suggesting 'With (A), (B) also'—often rendered as a simple 'but' in English, despite a meaning closer to 'and also'.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of も is complex and not definitively settled.  Some scholars trace it to a Proto-Japanese demonstrative pronoun. However, its current function as a particle has evolved over centuries, absorbing influences from other particles and grammatical structures.  The flexibility and diverse applications of も reflect this long and multifaceted evolution within the Japanese language.",

      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the polite form 「です」 making it appropriate for most conversations. The use of 「も」 after 「私」 indicates that the speaker's preference is the same as something previously mentioned."

    {
      "japanese": "彼も映画を見ました。",
      "english": "He also watched the movie.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses past tense  「ました」 which is a common polite past tense verb ending. The inclusion of 「も」 indicates that the action was shared by the subject and someone else."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "猫も杓子もみんな来ます。",
      "english": "Everybody is coming, even the cats.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This uses the casual present tense 「ます」 but the hyperbolic inclusion of even cats (「猫も杓子も」) adds a sense of exaggeration, making it informal."

    {
      "japanese": "私にも、チョコレートをください。",
      "english": "Give me some chocolate too.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "casual",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a polite request using 「ください」. The use of 「私にも」 emphasizes the speaker's desire to share in something the other person already has or is doing."

    {
      "japanese": "コーヒーも紅茶も飲めません。",
      "english": "I can't drink either coffee or tea.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The negative form 「ません」 paired with 「も」 shows the speaker's inability to consume both beverages.  This illustrates how も functions in negative sentences to indicate 'neither'."

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The casual 「好き？」 at the end makes it a flirty question. The 「も」 adds an implication of reciprocation, enhancing the romantic subtext.  The question, 「あなたも私のことが好き？」 is a common way for a female to flirt."

      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The casual 「くれない？」 makes it feel intimate.  The 「私にも」 implies that the speaker wants the same treatment given to others. 「もっと」 adds a feeling of neediness and increases the intensity of the request. The sentence is softer if a woman is speaking to a man."
