  "etymology": "あり is the archaic form of the verb ある (aru), meaning \"to exist\" or \"to be.\"  Its usage reflects a slightly more formal or literary tone compared to the modern ある. The nuance shifts from simply stating existence to suggesting a possibility or presence within a larger context.",
  "writeup": "The word \"あり\" (ari) is the literary, and less common, form of the u-verb ある (aru), 'to be' or 'to exist'.  Unlike its more modern counterpart, あり often implies a sense of possibility or presence *among* other options, rather than simply stating existence. Think of it as suggesting something is 'available,' 'a possibility,' or 'included among other things.' This is especially relevant when presenting one option amongst multiple possibilities.  It can also be used as an affirmative response, signifying agreement or acceptance of a suggested possibility.  While the kanji 有り is most commonly used, 在る is sometimes employed, subtly changing the implication. 有り emphasizes 'inclusiveness within a whole,' whereas 在る stresses 'independent existence.'  Keep this subtle difference in mind when selecting the kanji to use.",

Consider the other aspects of the sentence to ensure the meaning is accurately conveyed.",
