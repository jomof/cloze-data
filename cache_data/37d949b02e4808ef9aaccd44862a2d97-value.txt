        "Part of Speech": "Conjunction",
        "Register": "Formal to semi-formal",
        "Usage": "Used to connect two sentences or clauses where the second statement contrasts, qualifies, or limits the first. It often implies that the speaker is aware of the first statement's implication, but wants to introduce a contrasting viewpoint or situation.",
        "Related Expressions": "しかし, しかしながら, けれども, かといって, だからといって, そうかといって"

    "etymology": "「と言う」 (to say) in its て-form, indicating a continuation or connection between two thoughts or statements. It suggests the speaker is 'saying' or acknowledging something, but then introducing a contrasting or qualifying point.",
    "writeup": "「と言って」 is a conjunction used to introduce a contrasting or qualifying statement. It's similar to saying \"however,\" \"but,\" or \"having said that.\" The phrase acknowledges the preceding statement but introduces a contrasting viewpoint, limitation, or situation. It's often used in semi-formal to formal settings. It implies that the speaker is aware of the initial statement's implications but wants to present a contradictory or qualifying perspective. It's less direct than 「しかし」, adding a subtle layer of acknowledgment before the contrast.",
