  "etymology": "The word 結構 comes from the verb 結ぶ (musubu) meaning \"to tie, to bind, to connect,\" and the suffix -け (ke).  The original meaning related to something being \"well-arranged\" or \"well-structured.\" Over time, this evolved to its current meaning of \"quite,\" \"fairly,\" or \"rather.\" The evolution reflects a shift in the understanding of what constitutes something 'well-done'—from a neat arrangement to a satisfying degree or amount.",
  "writeup": "結構 (kekkou) is commonly understood as an adverb, modifying the entire sentence to mean \"quite,\" \"a lot,\" \"fairly,\" or \"rather.\"  It's important to note that while it's grammatically a な-adjective, its adjectival use is less frequent than its adverbial function.  Therefore, it's typically used before a whole phrase without な or だ.  However, be aware of its common use as a polite refusal, meaning \"no, thank you\" or \"I'm fine, thank you.\"  This dual functionality makes it a versatile, yet potentially confusing, word for learners.  Mastering its nuances will significantly enhance your conversational fluency.",
