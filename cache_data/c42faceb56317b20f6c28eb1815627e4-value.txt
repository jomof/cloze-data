    "etymology": "「その」 refers to something previously mentioned, and 「上」 literally means 'above' or 'on top'.  Therefore, 「その上」 can be understood as 'on top of that' or 'in addition to that'.",
    "writeup": "「その上」 is a formal conjunction in Japanese that adds further information to a previous statement. It conveys the meaning of \"besides,\" \"in addition to,\" or \"furthermore.\" It is typically placed at the beginning of a sentence to introduce additional details that support or expand upon what has already been mentioned. While considered a more formal expression, its utility in simply adding information makes it fairly common in everyday speech. Think of it as saying, \"and on top of that...\"",
