  "writeup": "The Japanese particle みたい (mitai) means \"like,\" \"similar to,\" or \"resembling.\"  It's a versatile expression used to compare things or describe appearances.  It follows a noun or na-adjective, conveying a sense of resemblance or similarity based on observation.  While often followed by だ (da) or です (desu), these are frequently omitted in casual conversation.  Note the distinction from 見たい (mitai), which means 'to want to see'.  This is a crucial point; context is essential to avoid confusion.  みたい is commonly used in casual settings and is considered less formal than ようだ (yōda), its more formal counterpart.  It's generally used when the speaker has a direct impression of the similarity.",
  "etymology": "みたい (mitai) is a contraction of the longer phrase を見たような (wo mita yōna), meaning \"like I saw it.\" This reveals its origin in visual perception, explaining why it emphasizes resemblance based on observation.",

      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of \"まるで\" (marude) intensifies the comparison, making it more poetic and fitting for a flirtatious context.  The informal \"だよ\" (dayo) enhances the casual and intimate tone, typical in conversations between close friends or romantic partners. The 「まるで天使みたいだよ」 is a common phrase for flirting."

      "conjugation": "plain past",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the past tense to describe a past observation.  The repeated use of 「みたい」 emphasizes the striking resemblance to a fairy. The use of 「まるで」 adds a layer of emphasis to the comparison. The casual nature of the sentence is appropriate for a conversation amongst friends, or those who are relatively close. The use of 「綺麗だった」 (kirei datta) is appropriate to a male speaker."

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the degree of formality and the context influence whether you omit だ (da) or です (desu) after みたい.  Practice using it in various situations to internalize its natural usage.",

    {
      "term": "にみえる",

Consider whether you are describing a visual resemblance, making a general observation, or expressing a likelihood.  The context and formality of the situation will also guide your choice."
