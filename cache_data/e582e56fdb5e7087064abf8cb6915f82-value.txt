  "writeup": "The phrase ～のが好き (no ga suki) is a fundamental Japanese construction expressing enjoyment of an activity.  It literally translates to \"the doing of ~ is pleasing,\" but it's naturally rendered as \"I like doing ~\" or \"I love doing ~\" in English.  This structure uses the plain (dictionary) form of the verb, regardless of whether it's an Ichidan or Godan verb.  The particle の (no) nominalizes the verb phrase, while が (ga) marks the subject of the resulting nominalized clause.  Importantly,  while のは is often interchangeable with のが, only が is appropriate with this specific expression.  To express liking something in the past,  only the 好き (suki) portion changes to its past tense form; the verb remains in its plain form.  You can also use this structure to inquire about others' preferences by adding the question particle か (ka).",
