    "writeup": "ていただけませんか is the humble speech form of てもらえませんか, which itself is the negative potential form of てもらう \"to have (something) done by someone else\".  This structure combines て (the conjunction particle), the verb いただく (humble form of もらう, meaning \"to receive\" or in this context, \"to have something done\"), the polite negative auxiliary verb ません, and the question particle か.  It generally translates to something similar to てもらえませんか \"won't you (do something)?\" or \"could you please (do something)?\". The verb いただく is often written as 頂く, and its kanji form literally means \"to be topped with\". This conveys a sense of respect, acknowledging that the person performing the action is doing so from a position of giving or offering.  Consider how this \"to be topped/capped with\" meaning appears in a standard sentence like 「雪を頂いた山はとてもきれいだ。」 (A snow-capped mountain is very beautiful.).",
