    "writeup": "**どころか (dokoroka)** combines the noun **ところ (tokoro)**, meaning \"place\", with the sentence-ending particle **か (ka)**. The change from **ところ (tokoro)** to **どころ (dokoro)** often indicates a negative connotation. It translates to \"far from\", \"let alone\", or \"anything but.\" This grammar point strongly negates a statement (A) while emphasizing a more important point (B). The part after **どころか** is always emphasized as being more important than the first part.

    **どころか** can follow the dictionary form of a verb, an い-adjective, the stem of a な-adjective, or a noun. The literal translation of **どころか** is similar to \"it's not even remotely (A)\" or \"do you honestly think it's (A)?\" It is used to express a strong contrast or denial.",
    "etymology": "The word **どころ (dokoro)** comes from **所 (tokoro)**, meaning \"place\" or \"extent\". The addition of **か (ka)** creates a rhetorical question or statement of doubt, emphasizing the distance from the initial statement.",
