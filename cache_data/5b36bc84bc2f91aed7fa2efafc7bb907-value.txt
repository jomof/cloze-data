    "etymology": "ずに is derived from the classical negative auxiliary verb ず (nu), combined with the particle に (ni). ず is an older form of ない (nai), and に functions similarly to で (de) in this context, indicating a state or condition.",
    "writeup": "ずに indicates doing something \"without\" doing something else. It is similar in meaning to ないで, but ずに carries a more formal and somewhat literary nuance. To form it, attach ずに to the stem of a verb (the form you use before ない). For する verbs, する becomes せずに. For example, 勉強する (benkyou suru - to study) becomes 勉強せずに (benkyou sezu ni - without studying).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   ずに is more formal than ないで.\n*   The particle に is sometimes omitted, although this is less common.\n*   Pay attention to the exception for する verbs; they become せずに.",
