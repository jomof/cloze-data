  "writeup": "に足りない is a grammar expression used after the dictionary form of verbs.  It indicates that something is 'not worth (A)' or 'not sufficient for (A)'. It's a combination of the particle に and the verb 足りる (tariru), meaning 'to be sufficient' or 'to be enough'.  This structure is **formal**, predominantly used in literature or formal speech.  While similar to に足る (ni taru), which conversely highlights worth or lack thereof, they differ. 足る is an う-verb, more common in literature or western Japan. Its negative form is 足らない (tarinai), not たりない. \n\n**Caution:** Both たりない and 足らない can be part of the phrase 取るに足りない (toru ni tarinai), meaning 'worthless' or 'not worth discussing'.",
  "etymology": "The grammar point に足りない comes from the combination of the particle に (ni) indicating a target or purpose, and the verb 足りる (tariru), which means \"to be enough\" or \"to be sufficient\".  足りる itself is derived from 足 (ashi) meaning \"foot\" or \"leg\", and りる (-ru), a verbal suffix.  The original sense of 足りる was likely related to having enough legs or support to stand firm or complete a task.",

      "english": "That evidence was insufficient to solve the case.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "academic",
      "conjugation": "past tense",
      "nuance": "The past tense 「足りなかった」 indicates that the insufficiency of the evidence is a fact established in the past.  Again, there is no specific gender or age implication in this formally stated, academic observation."

      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The speaker uses a semi-formal register, keeping a polite distance while suggesting a lack of romantic connection, perhaps in the early stages of a relationship. 「足りなかった」 (tarinakatta) conveys this subtle rejection. The female speaker's perspective is clearly conveyed."

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that に足りない is primarily a formal expression. While these examples show various tenses, the core meaning of insufficiency remains constant.  Practice using it in formal writing or situations where a more serious tone is necessary. Avoiding its use in casual conversation will make your Japanese sound more natural.",
