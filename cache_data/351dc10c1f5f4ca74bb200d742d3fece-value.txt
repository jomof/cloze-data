  "writeup": "The word わけ (wake) is often misunderstood. While commonly translated as 'reason,' 'cause,' 'meaning,' or 'conclusion,' it's more helpful to see it as similar to the English word 'so.'  In essence, わけ emphasizes the existence or determination of something.  わけだ, a combination of わけ and the auxiliary verb だ, appears at sentence ends, sometimes preceded by という.  It signifies 'for that reason,' 'no wonder,' or 'as you'd expect,' but fundamentally means 'it is so that it's (A)' or 'so it's (A).' Because わけ is a noun, it requires the attributive form of preceding words. Like 'so,' わけ's nuance ranges from causal explanation to simple emphasis.  It's also used in questions, suggesting the speaker seeks confirmation of an implied conclusion.",
  "etymology": "わけ (wake) originates from the verb 分ける (wakeru), meaning 'to divide' or 'to separate.'  The noun form わけ came to represent a portion or aspect separated for understanding, hence its meaning of 'reason' or 'cause.'  The combination with だ further reinforces the conclusive nature of the statement.",
