    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことだし」 is derived from 「こと」 (thing, matter, fact), 「だ」 (copula), and 「し」 (a conjunctive particle used to list reasons). The 「こと」 nominalizes the preceding phrase, 「だ」 asserts it, and 「し」 adds the nuance that this is one of several reasons.",
    "writeup": "「ことだし」 combines the noun 「こと」 'thing', the auxiliary verb 「だ」, and the conjunctive particle 「し」. It's used for listing reasons, often translating as \"because (A)\" or \"since (A),\" but emphasizing that there are other reasons besides the one specified. Just like with its standard use in creating lists, 「し」 implies that (A) isn't the only reason. The implication is that \"while there are other reasons, (A) is good enough to (B).\" (B) is usually a suggestion, invitation, or expression of determination.",
