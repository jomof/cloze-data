    "etymology": "で originates from the continuative form (連用形, ren'yōkei) of the copula だ (da). Its use evolved to indicate the location where an action occurs.",
    "writeup": "で is a particle with several uses. It highlights something essential for an action. One such use specifies the location where an action takes place, translating to \"at\" or \"in.\" The place is considered integral to the action or its outcome. This contrasts with に, which marks the location as the destination or target of an action. Think of it as: (A) 'place' allows (B) 'action' to occur (で), versus (A) 'place' is the target for (B) 'action' occurring (に).",
