    "writeup": "To indicate that something is \"equal to or more than (A),\" the expression 以上 (ijō) is used.  It combines the kanji 以 (i), meaning \"by means of,\" and 上 (jō), meaning \"above.\"  This can also be translated as \"greater than (A)\" or \"exceeding (A).\" To use 以上, attach it directly to the amount you want to set as the minimum. 以上 is also commonly used as a statement meaning roughly \"the end\" or \"that's it,\" signaling the completion of something. While saying \"the end\" might sound abrupt in English, it's perfectly natural in Japanese and literally means \"the above (list of things I said) is all.\"",
