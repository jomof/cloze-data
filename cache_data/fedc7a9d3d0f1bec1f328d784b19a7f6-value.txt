    "etymology": "中 (naka) means \"inside\" or \"middle\". The particle を (o/wo) marks the direct object or, in this case, the place of motion or where an action occurs.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「中を」 combines the noun **中 (naka)**, meaning \"inside\", with the particle **を (o)**. While **を** typically marks the direct object of a verb, here it indicates the place where an action occurs. Think of it as signifying movement *through* or *within* a space. Therefore, 「中を」 translates to \"in\", \"on\", \"into\", or \"inside of\", indicating that an action is taking place within the confines of the noun preceding it. The noun marked by 「中を」 serves as the location where the subsequent verb's action unfolds.  It's **important** to note that the subject performing the action doesn't necessarily have to be physically inside the location. For example, with verbs like 覗く (nozoku - to peek), the action is directed *into* the space.",
