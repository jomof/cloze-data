  "writeup": "The Japanese word 向き (muki) is a noun often functioning as a suffix.  It originates from the intransitive verb 向く (muku), meaning 'to face.'  When attached to nouns, it indicates something is 'facing (A)' or 'suitable for (A).'  Because 向く is intransitive, 向き usually implies a natural or coincidental facing, suggesting suitability rather than deliberate design.  This subtly contrasts with 向け (muke), derived from the transitive verb 向ける (mukeru), which implies something is specifically *designed* or *intended* for (A).  While both express appropriateness, 向き suggests natural fit, whereas 向け implies a purposeful creation for a specific purpose.  Understanding this nuance is key to accurate usage.",
  "etymology": "向き (muki) derives directly from the intransitive verb 向く (muku), meaning \"to face,\" \"to be directed toward.\" The suffix -き (-ki) transforms the verb into a noun, indicating a state or condition. The original sense of facing physically or directionally extends to a metaphorical suitability or appropriateness.",
