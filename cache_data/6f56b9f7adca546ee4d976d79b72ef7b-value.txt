    "etymology": "「だが」 is a combination of the copula 「だ」 (to be) and the conjunction 「が」 (but). 「ですが」 is the polite form, using the polite copula 「です」.",
    "writeup": "「だが」 and its polite form 「ですが」 function as conjunctions meaning \"but,\" \"however,\" or \"nevertheless.\" They are used to connect sentences or phrases, indicating a contrast or concession. 「だが」 is considered more formal. It's similar to saying \"That may be, but...\" in English.\n\n*   「ですが」 automatically implies that the rest of the sentence should use polite speech. 「だが」 does not have this implication.\n*   Adding 「ね」 to 「だが」 (「だがね」) softens the tone, but this usage is less common in modern Japanese, primarily used by older generations.\n*   In casual speech, 「でも」 is more common than 「だが」 or 「ですが」.",

Choosing the appropriate conjunction depends on the context and desired level of formality."
