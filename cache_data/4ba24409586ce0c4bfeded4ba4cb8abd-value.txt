    "writeup": "ぞ is a sentence-ending particle used for **strong emphasis**, similar to よ, but much stronger. It is predominantly used by men. While よ may simply state a point or a fact, ぞ is typically reserved for more forcefully highlighting something. It is often translated as an exclamation point. ぞ can be used at the end of any sentence, but it must follow conjugatable words such as verbs, adjectives, and auxiliary verbs in their informal forms.\n\nSpeakers often use ぞ to encourage or convince themselves, rather than specifically directing the statement at someone else. It can convey excitement, determination, or a strong assertion.\n\nWhile less common, ぞ can also function as an adverbial particle, similar to は. In such cases, it adds emphasis and draws extra attention to the topic itself. This adverbial use of ぞ can also follow question words like どこ (where), 誰 (who), and 何 (what), though the emphasis is slightly less intense than with standard nouns.",
    "etymology": "The etymology of ぞ is not definitively known, but it is thought to have evolved from older emphatic particles in Japanese. Its usage has become strongly associated with male speech, conveying a sense of assertiveness and directness.",
