  "writeup": "The verb 続ける (tsuzukeru) means \"to continue.\"  It's a versatile verb used across various registers and contexts.  Attaching it to the stem of another verb (using the -te form) allows you to express the continuation of an action.  For instance,  勉強して続ける (benkyou shite tsuzukeru) means \"to continue studying.\"  The nuance subtly differs from using the て form conjunction (e.g., 勉強して、続ける; benkyou shite, tsuzukeru which implies a sequential action rather than a continuous one).  This grammar point is fundamental and widely used in everyday Japanese conversations.",
  "etymology": "続ける (tsuzukeru) is composed of  続く (tsuzuku, to continue) and the causative suffix -eru, indicating 'to cause to continue' or 'to keep going'. This evolution highlights the inherent sense of sustained action.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these terms share some semantic overlap with 続ける, understanding their subtle differences in nuance is key.  Pay close attention to whether you want to emphasize the *process* of continuation (続ける), the *intensity* of continuation (ばかりだ, 一方だ), the *gradual development* of a state (てくる), or the *current state* of an action (ている). Choosing the right word will make your Japanese more precise and natural."
