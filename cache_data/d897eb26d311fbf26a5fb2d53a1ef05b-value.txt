    "etymology": "The particle か is believed to have originated from the verb 掻く (kaku), meaning \"to scratch\" or \"to dig.\" Its use as a question marker likely evolved from the idea of \"scratching\" for an answer or seeking clarification.",
    "writeup": "The particle か is primarily used at the end of a sentence to indicate that it is a question. This is the same as adding a question mark “?” in English. It can also express uncertainty or doubt. か is versatile and can be used after both polite (です, ます) and plain forms, although using it directly after a plain form can sound casual or even rude, so be mindful of your audience. か also has other uses, such as expressing alternatives, but that will be covered elsewhere.",
