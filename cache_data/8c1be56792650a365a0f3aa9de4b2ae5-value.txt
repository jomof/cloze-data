  "writeup": "The grammar point 除いて (no zoite) is a formal expression meaning \"except for,\" \"with the exception of,\" or \"unless.\"  It's formed by combining を (o), the particle marking the object of a verb, and 除いて, the te-form of the verb 除く (nozoku), meaning \"to exclude.\"  This construction is commonly used in formal settings, such as official announcements or written documents.  It's less frequently used in casual conversation, where simpler alternatives like 以外 (igai) might be preferred.  Understanding its nuance is key to using it correctly and sounding natural in formal contexts.  Mastering 除いて adds sophistication to your Japanese.  Note that the basic form 除く (nozoku) is less common in this construction compared to the て-form.",
  "etymology": "The verb 除く (nozoku) itself has ancient roots, ultimately deriving from a combination of elements indicating removal or setting aside.  The て-form adds a layer of nuance, implying a conditional exclusion.",

Choosing the right word depends heavily on the context: 以外 is appropriate for everyday conversation, while はともかく emphasizes setting an element aside for the sake of discussion, and 除いて maintains the formality of the sentence."
