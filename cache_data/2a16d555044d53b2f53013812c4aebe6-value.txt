    "etymology": "「大体」 is written with the kanji 「大」 (dai, meaning 'big' or 'large') and 「体」 (tai, meaning 'body' or 'form'). The combination suggests the 'main part' or 'overall form' of something, which leads to its various meanings related to approximation and generality.",
    "writeup": "「だいたい」 is an adverb with several nuances, all relating to the idea of the \"main point\" or \"general idea\" of something. It can mean \"mostly,\" \"generally,\" or \"for the most part.\" Like other adverbs of amount, 「だいたい」 can modify entire phrases or appear directly before a noun as 「大体の + noun」. Similar to 「そもそも」 (\"in the first place\"), 「だいたい」 can also carry this meaning, often when expressing a desired outcome that didn't happen. Both uses express what is essentially correct, most common, or the original state of something. A synonym for 「大体」 is 「根本」 (konpon), meaning \"the source\" or \"the origin,\" reinforcing the idea of expressing something in its unaltered essence.",
