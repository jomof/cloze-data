  "writeup": "The particle に, combined with the て-form of the verb 沿う (sou), meaning \"to run alongside,\" creates the expression に沿って.  This construction signifies that something is done \"along with (A),\" \"in accordance with (A),\" or \"in line with (A).\"  The focus is on adhering to a pre-existing rule, guideline, or pattern represented by (A).  (A) sets the standard, and (B) (the action) follows it.  Think of it like a train following a set track; the track (A) dictates the route of the train (B). This grammar point is typically used in formal settings, often concerning regulations, procedures, or established norms. While it's primarily formal, its literal meaning, 'alongside,' allows for somewhat more casual applications when describing spatial relationships.",
  "etymology": "The verb 沿う (sou) itself is quite evocative. It paints a picture of something moving alongside something else.  Its original meaning is connected to the concept of following a path or a course, reflecting its usage in phrases relating to physical proximity or following a given direction.",
