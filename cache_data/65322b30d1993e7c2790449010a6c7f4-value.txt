  "writeup": "だけでなく (an abbreviation of だ けで は な く) is a common Japanese construction translating to 'not only (A), but also (B)'.  Sometimes (B) is implied.  It connects to phrases where だけ would usually be used.  The で in だけでなく isn't the particle で; it's the auxiliary verb だ in its conjunctive form. は is often dropped from では expressions, or changed to じゃ for easier pronunciation.  The conjunction particle て should follow なく (the conjunctive form of the い-adjective ない), but て is often omitted. In writing, without a comma (読点) after なく, the full なくて form is required.  With a comma, both forms are grammatically correct.",
  "etymology": "The phrase is a combination of だけ \"only\" and は not.  The construction emphasizes that the first element is not the only one, highlighting the inclusion of a second, often equally or more important, element.  The use of では, a slightly archaic phrasing, lends a formal or literary touch when the は is included, but is typically dropped in casual conversation, showing a natural and fluent change in common speech that is natural to this phrase.",
