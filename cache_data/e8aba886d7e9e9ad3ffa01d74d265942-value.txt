    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the te-form of a verb with the verb 来る (kuru), meaning \"to come.\" The te-form indicates a sequence of actions or a state resulting from a previous action.

    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てくる」 combines the **て-form** of a verb with the verb **来る (くる)**, which means \"to come.\"  Think of it as a two-step process: first, an action happens (represented by the verb in て-form), and then that action \"comes\" to the present or a future point. \n\n「てくる」 can express movement towards the speaker, a change that has occurred over time, or an action that started in the past and continues to the present.  Whether you use kanji (来てくる) or hiragana (てくる) for the \"くる\" part often depends on whether you're emphasizing physical movement or a more abstract change or continuation.  \n\nThis is the counterpart to 「ていく」, which indicates movement away from the speaker or a change that will continue into the future. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   When referring to physical movement, 「来てくる」 is common (though not mandatory).\n*   When describing a change over time, 「てくる」 often translates to \"has come to be,\" \"has become,\" or \"is starting to.\"",
