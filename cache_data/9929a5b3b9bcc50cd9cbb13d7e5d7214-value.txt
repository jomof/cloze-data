    "etymology": "「まい」comes from the kanji 「毎」 meaning \"every\". 「ように」is from 「様」 which expresses the 'manner' in which something is existing or happening.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「まい〜のように」indicates that something happens 'in the manner/way of every (A)', where (A) is a measurement of time or frequency. It's often translated as \"almost every (A)\", \"nearly every (A)\", or \"on an (A) basis\". The nuance lies in the listener's interpretation as to whether the speaker means 'every' or 'almost every'.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nUnlike 「みたいに」and 「のように」, which are often interchangeable, 「まい〜のように」cannot be used to describe things that cannot be seen, like time. 「みたいだ」is an abbreviation of the more formal phrase 「を見たような」, which can sound unnatural in such contexts.",
