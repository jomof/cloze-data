    "details": {
        "Usage": "Used with verbs of motion (行く, 来る, 帰る, etc.) to express the purpose of going, coming, or returning.",
        "Motion Verbs": "Verbs like 歩く (walk), 走る (run), and 泳ぐ (swim) are generally *not* used with this grammar point because they describe the manner of movement rather than a movement to a specific location *for a purpose*."
    },
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」, when used after the ます-stem of a verb and before a verb of motion (like 「行く」, 「来る」, 「帰る」), indicates the purpose of the movement. Think of it as saying \"in order to do something.\" For example, 「食べに」 means \"in order to eat,\" or simply \"to eat.\" This grammar point is used to express *why* someone is moving from one place to another. It's important to note that only verbs expressing movement from one place to another (verbs of motion) can be used with this grammar. Verbs describing a *manner* of movement, such as 「歩く」(to walk), are not typically used.",
    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 has various functions, but in this case, it's acting as a marker of purpose. The combination of the verb's ます-stem + に effectively nominalizes the verb, turning it into a noun-like phrase that can express the reason for the movement.",
