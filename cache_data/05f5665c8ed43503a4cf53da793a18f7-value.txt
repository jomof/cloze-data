    "writeup": "は (pronounced わ) is often considered to be one of the most difficult particles to master in Japanese, alongside が. は marks the topic of the sentence and describes the whole sentence broadly. However, が primarily marks single actions or statements. We will explore this distinction in more detail when covering が. In many sentences (especially short ones), either は or が would be considered perfectly natural. This depends on whether someone is simply stating something (は), or highlighting it especially (が).\n\nIn the example sentence 「今日は、雨。」, は broadly describes what the sentence is about (today). In the sentence 「私は、金曜日が好き。」, は again describes the whole sentence being about 'me', but the focus is on Friday.  In the sentence 「私は、金曜日は好き。」, は indicates a comparison to other days.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   は cannot be used to describe things that you are seeing or experiencing \"in the moment\" (right now). This is because 'in the moment' events are considered part of a larger experience (your whole day, for example).\n*   は has two main functions. The first marks the topic of the sentence, and the second is used for contrast or making comparisons. Although there are no 'strict' rules for this, when は is used toward (or after) the middle of a sentence, it will usually have the nuance of contrast.",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "The sentence 「今はテスト。」 uses 「は」 to indicate the topic, but it feels slightly unnatural because the test is happening in the immediate present.  Using 「が」 here might sound more natural to emphasize the current event."

            "setting": "friendly",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "friendly",
            "nuance": "By placing 「は」 after 「金曜日」 in 「私は、金曜日は好き。」, a contrast is implied, suggesting a comparison with other days of the week.  The focus shifts slightly to Friday in comparison to other days."
