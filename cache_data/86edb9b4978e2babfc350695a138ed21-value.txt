  "writeup": "ものか is a set expression in Japanese used to emphatically reject a preceding statement.  It combines the noun もの \"thing\" and the particle か, which expresses doubt or uncertainty. Common translations include \"definitely not,\" \"absolutely not,\" and \"do you really think that?\"  The literal meaning is closer to \"as if,\" implying the speaker's strong disagreement. ものか can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns modified by な. Variations include もんか, もんですか, and ものですか, with women traditionally favoring the latter two. When following the past tense (た-form), it implies the speaker finds the event highly undesirable and unbearable.  Important Considerations: While primarily expressing strong negation, ものか can also express disbelief or shock regarding an amount, possibility, or outcome. In such cases, \"as if\" remains a useful interpretation, conveying the speaker's reaction to the situation. It is crucial to understand context.",
