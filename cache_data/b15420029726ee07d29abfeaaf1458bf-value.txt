    "etymology": "The etymology of 「つい」 is somewhat debated, but it's generally understood to be related to the idea of something happening in a brief moment or unexpectedly. The original nuance suggests a feeling of \"just now\" or \"suddenly,\" which evolved to encompass actions done without conscious thought or control.",
    "writeup": "「つい」 is an adverb that conveys doing something accidentally, unconsciously, or against one's better judgment. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence and is frequently paired with the 「てしまう」 form to emphasize the unintentional nature of the action. It's similar to the English concept of a \"lapse\" in judgment or forethought.\n\n「つい」 can also imply a small gap or interval, emphasizing the temporal aspect of the action. This gives the impression that whatever led to the accidental action happened momentarily, akin to a \"lapse in time\".",
