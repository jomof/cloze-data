    "etymology": "The origin of 「が」 is complex and debated, but it's believed to have evolved from earlier grammatical elements. In Old Japanese, particles like 「か」 and 「つ」 played roles in marking case, and 「が」 likely emerged from these as a way to specifically denote the subject of a sentence. Its function has solidified over centuries of linguistic development.",
    "writeup": "「が」 is the subject marker in Japanese, indicating the person or thing performing an action or possessing a specific characteristic. It emphasizes the element preceding it, drawing attention to the subject. While 「は」 highlights the topic of the sentence, 「が」 focuses on the subject itself, often introducing new information or distinguishing it from other possibilities.\n\n「が」 is used to describe situations occurring \"in the moment\" or independently. However, it's generally avoided when describing oneself, unless contrasting oneself with others. In general descriptions about oneself, 「は」 sounds more natural.",
