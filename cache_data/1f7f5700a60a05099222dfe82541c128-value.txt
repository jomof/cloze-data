    "etymology": "The 'te' form of a verb (〜て) indicates a sequence or connection of actions. 'Kara' (から) means 'from' or 'after'. Together, 'te kara' (てから) signifies that an action follows another in time.",
    "writeup": "**てから** indicates that one action happens *after* another is completed. It emphasizes the sequential relationship between the two actions. The basic meaning is 'after doing X, do Y' or 'once X is done, then Y'. It emphasizes that the first action enables or precedes the second. It is more emphatic about the sequence than simply using the **te-form** to link verbs.",

Other similar expressions have slightly different nuances. あとで is just 'later', たら is 'if/when', 上で implies doing something *based* on the first action, and から can mean 'because'. て初めて is 'only after realizing'. Simply using the te-form (Verb+て) just joins events without emphasizing sequence."
