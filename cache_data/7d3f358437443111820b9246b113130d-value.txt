    "etymology": "The word 「はず」 comes from the kanji 「筈」, which originally referred to the notched end of an arrow that fits onto the bowstring. From this literal meaning, it evolved to imply something that is supposed to fit or be in a certain way, hence its current usage to express expectation or certainty.",
    "writeup": "「はずだ」 expresses a strong expectation or conviction that something is true or will happen, based on reason or evidence. It conveys a higher degree of certainty than a mere guess but doesn't imply absolute proof. Think of it as \"it's supposed to be\" or \"it's expected that\". It functions as a noun, so it's often followed by 「だ」 or 「です」. You can use 「はずだ」 after verbs, adjectives, and nouns in their plain forms to express this expectation.",
