  "writeup": "お～ください is an honorific language expression in Japanese used similarly to なさい. It's the polite imperative form of くださる, the honorific equivalent of くれる.  Therefore, it conveys 'please do (A) for me'. お～ください is more polite than なさい and can be used when making requests to almost anyone, regardless of their status relative to yours.  **Important Consideration:** ご～ください is only used as part of the humble speech expression ご～する (or お～する). In such cases, it becomes ご～してください.",
  "etymology": "The polite imperative お～ください derives from the verb くださる (kudasaru), meaning 'to give' or 'to bestow,' which is itself a humble and polite form related to the more casual verb くれる (kureru). The 'お' prefix adds further politeness and formality.",
