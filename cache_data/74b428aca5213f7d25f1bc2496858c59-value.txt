    "etymology": "「場合 (ばあい)」 means \"case\" or \"situation\". The particle 「は」 here functions contrastively, often highlighting a specific case being discussed.",
    "writeup": "「場合は」 is a common Japanese phrase signifying \"in the event of (A)\" or \"in the case of (A)\".  It attaches directly to nouns with the addition of 「の」, or to verbs and い-adjectives in their plain form. For な-adjectives, use 「な」.  「場合」 itself means \"case\" or \"situation\".  It's frequently used to present a hypothetical scenario or to emphasize a specific viewpoint or characteristic, often in comparison to something else. The particle 「は」 emphasizes this contrast. **Important Consideration:** Because 「場合」 carries a nuance of encountering a situation somewhat randomly, 「場合は」 is generally unsuitable for describing regularly occurring or planned events. Use 「ときは」 for such cases.",
