  "writeup": "たって is a casual sentence ending particle used primarily in informal settings.  It conveys the meaning of \"even if,\" \"even though,\" or \"no matter how.\"  Think of it as a more emphatic and slightly rougher version of ても (te mo) or でも (de mo).  It's crucial to understand that its casual nature limits its use to close friends and family. Using it in formal situations would be inappropriate.  The conjugation of the preceding verb or adjective remains consistent with the past tense form.  For example, with い-adjectives,  たって attaches to the く-form (e.g., 高くたって - takaku tatte).  For nouns and な-adjectives, だ (da) changes to た (ta), and だって (datte) follows. The etymology traces back to たとて (tato te), a combination of the auxiliary verb た (ta) and the particle とて (tote), an older form of と言っても (to itte mo) 'even if (one) says'.  This reflects the nuance of 'even if it is said...' which adds to its overall meaning.",
  "etymology": "The casual particle たって (tatte) originates from the older form たとて (tato te), a contraction of た (ta) and とて (tote).  とて is considered an archaic abbreviation of と言っても (to itte mo), meaning \"even if it's said.\" This historical connection explains the nuance of concession and emphasis inherent in たって.",
