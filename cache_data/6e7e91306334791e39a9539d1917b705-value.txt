  "writeup": "The grammar point 「た末・の末」 (ta sue / no sue) indicates a result or conclusion reached after a period of time, effort, or deliberation. 「末」(sue) itself means \"end\" or \"tip.\"  When used with a verb in the past form (た) or a noun with the particle 「の」(no), it signifies that something happened after a process, struggle, or extended period of consideration.

It is like saying \"at the very end of\" or \"the culmination of.\"",
