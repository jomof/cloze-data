        "Subject": "The subject of くれる is the person performing the action.",

    },
    "etymology": "呉れる (kureru) originally meant 'to give' and is written with the kanji 呉, but in modern usage, it's mostly written in hiragana (くれる) when used as an auxiliary verb. It implies a sense of favor or benefit conferred upon the speaker or someone close to them.",
    "writeup": "くれる (kureru) is an auxiliary verb used to express that someone does something for the speaker (or someone closely associated with the speaker). It conveys the nuance of the action being a favor or benefit to the speaker or their 'in-group'. It's attached to the te-form of a verb (V-te + くれる). For example, 電話をくれる (denwa o kureru) means \"someone gives me a call\".\n\n*   **Important Considerations:**\n    *   The receiver of the favor **must** be the speaker or someone closely related to them. You **cannot** use くれる when someone does something for a person outside of your immediate social circle.\n    *   The level of politeness can be adjusted by conjugating くれる itself (e.g., くれます, くれました, くれない).",
