    "writeup": "がる is a う-verb that functions primarily as a suffix. It attaches to the stem of い-adjectives (removing the い) or な-adjectives (without the な).  It conveys the nuance of \"acting like (A)\" or \"showing signs of being (A)\".  Crucially, it's used when inferring someone else's feelings or desires, as directly stating them requires explicit confirmation (often using the quotation particle と).  Instead of stating directly how someone feels,がる allows you to express your observation or impression. For example, seeing someone shiver, you'd useがる to say they appear to feel cold.  The distinction betweenがる and がっている lies in duration.がる describes a habitual or general tendency, while がっている describes a specific instance. However, in modern Japanese, そう is increasingly used to express that someone \"seems\" a certain way, often replacing がっている for present-moment observations.  You can also useがる to describe yourself (in the third person perspective), implying how you believe you appear to others.",

    "etymology": "The suffix がる is believed to originate from the verb 気(け)がある (ke ga aru), meaning \"to have the feeling of\". Over time, it contracted and specialized to express the outward manifestation of inner feelings or desires.",
