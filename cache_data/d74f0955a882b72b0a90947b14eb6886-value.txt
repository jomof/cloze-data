  "writeup": "The particle つき (tsuki) is a formal grammatical structure derived from the combination of に (ni) and the conjunctive form of the u-verb 就く (tsuku), meaning \"to assume\" or \"to take up.\"  While its etymological root suggests a connection to assuming a role or position, its modern usage leans heavily toward indicating cause or reason.  Think of it as a more formal and nuanced version of  ため (tame) or  から (kara). つき directly follows a noun, explaining the reason or cause for a subsequent action or state.  Its formality restricts it primarily to written contexts like official announcements, legal documents, and formal notifications. Despite its diverse English translations, the fundamental meaning retains a sense of something being directly connected to or caused by the preceding noun.",
