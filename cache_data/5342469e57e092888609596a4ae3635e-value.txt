  "writeup": "The adverbial particle ばかり, when combined with the attributive form of verbs and the auxiliary verb だ (or です), indicates that only a particular action is occurring.  It often implies a continuous, often negative, trend—'keeps on -ing,' 'more and more,' or 'only continues to.'  This construction utilizes ばかり's inherent meaning of 'only' in a nuanced way.  Notice that this usage of ばかり is almost exclusively paired with verbs describing some form of change (increase/decrease, strengthening/weakening, improvement/worsening, etc.).  To add further information, だ changes to its conjunctive form で.  While predominantly used with negative trends, it's not grammatically restricted to them; positive trends can also be expressed, though less frequently.",

The context and the subtle emotional implications are crucial in deciding which to use."
