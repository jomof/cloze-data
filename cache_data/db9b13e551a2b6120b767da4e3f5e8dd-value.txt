    "writeup": "にとどまらず is a formal structure that combines the case marking particle に, the verb 止まる (とまる, \"to stop; to be limited to\"), and the negative auxiliary verb ず (a classical form of ない).  It is generally translated as \"not limited to (A)\" or \"not stopping at (A)\", and it follows words indicating a scope or boundary. It then introduces how something extends beyond that initial scope (B).\n\nにとどまらず is typically used with nouns or verbs in their dictionary form. This expression can highlight both positive and negative developments or consequences.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   にとどまらず emphasizes that the second element (B) is an expansion or natural progression from the first element (A).  (B) must be directly related to (A).\n*   The register is formal and often appears in written or more formal spoken contexts.",

    "post_example_writeup": "The example sentence \"このコンサートのチケットにとどまらず、限定グッズなども高かった\" is marked as \"Unnatural Japanese\". This is because while grammatically correct, the use of にとどまらず typically implies a logical or natural progression or expansion.  In this case, the price of tickets and merchandise, while related to the concert, aren't necessarily seen as one expanding from the other in the way にとどまらず usually conveys. A phrase like ～だけでなく would be more natural here.",
