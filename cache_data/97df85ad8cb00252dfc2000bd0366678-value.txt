    "writeup": "As a noun, 「あまり」 means \"excess\" and refers to an amount of something that is in surplus. This noun is quite often used after many different types of words to indicate that something happened or exists to an excessive degree, which then resulted in something negative occurring. By itself, 「余り」 is not negative. However, this grammar point can be thought of as a set phrase that is generally used in negative situations.\n\nTo use 「あまり」, you will need to attach it to the end of the following structures:\n\n*   A verb (dictionary form).\n*   An い-Adjective (that has been turned into a noun through the use of 「さ」 or 「み」) followed by 「の」.\n*   A な-Adjective followed by 「な」.\n*   A noun followed by 「の」.\n\nThen, after 「あまり」, a (B) phrase will highlight what the negative result was.\n\n**Important:** The tense of the overall sentence will depend on the first clause. Therefore, it is common to see the verb before 「あまり」 being used in several different tenses.",
