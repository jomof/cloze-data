    "etymology": "「で言うと」 is composed of 「で」 (the particle indicating means, method, or context) and 「言うと」 (the conditional form of the verb 「言う」, meaning 'to say'). Therefore, the literal breakdown is 'if you were to say with/by means of'.",
    "writeup": "「で言うと」 is used to make comparisons or provide explanations by relating something to a different context or perspective. It's similar to saying \"in terms of X\" or \"if we were to describe it as X\". It often appears in sentences where you're drawing an analogy or explaining something in more familiar terms.\n\n*   It's often seen with phrases like 「～に当たる」 (にあたる), meaning \"corresponds to\" or \"is equivalent to\".\n*   The set expression 「一言で言うと」 (ひとこと で いうと) means \"in a word\" or \"to put it simply\".",
