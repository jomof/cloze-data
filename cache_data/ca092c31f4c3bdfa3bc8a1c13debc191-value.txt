        "[Sentence] + ということは": "Indicates that the previous statement is being clarified or the speaker is confirming their understanding."
    },
    "etymology": "「という」 is from the verb 言う (iu, to say) in its quoted form. 「こと」 means 'thing' or 'matter'. 「は」 is the topic marker. So, literally, it means 'as for the thing that is said'.",
    "writeup": "ということは is a Japanese phrase often used mid-sentence to clarify a previous statement. It can be translated as \"that means\" or \"that is to say.\" Sentences using とい​うことは often end with ということだ, but this isn't always the case.\n\nA more literal translation is something similar to \"that which is said to be (A), (B),\" presenting (A) as needing further explanation.\n\nAdditionally, とい​うことは can begin sentences when the speaker confirms their understanding, often as a question. In these cases, it translates to \"so you mean to say that (A)?\" \n\nBreaking it down, 「という」 indicates something being quoted or said, 「こと」 refers to a thing or matter, and 「は」 marks the topic. It expresses that the 'thing' classified as (A) is generally understood to be (B).",
