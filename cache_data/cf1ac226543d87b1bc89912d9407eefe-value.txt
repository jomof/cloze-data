    "etymology": "The kanji 点 (ten) originally meant \"dot\" or \"spot.\" Over time, its meaning expanded to include the idea of a specific point or aspect. In grammar, it signifies focusing on a particular point for discussion or consideration.",
    "writeup": "点 is a kanji that is regularly used to express a specific \"point,\" \"spot,\" \"aspect,\" or something similar. When attached to the end of the attributive form of another word, it highlights that word as a point of interest within the sentence. This is regularly translated as \"from the aspect of (A),\" \"in respect to (A),\" \"in terms of (A),\" and other similar phrases that simply draw attention to something.\n\nTo use 点, attach it to the attributive form of another word, a noun followed by の, or a phrase followed by という. In all cases, 点 must be followed by the case-marking particle で. Sometimes, で (as \"with\" or \"at\") may be replaced with expressions such as について \"in relation to (A),\" or からいうと \"speaking from (A).\" So long as the grammar structure that accompanies 点 is also used to highlight something specific (and can be paired with a noun), it will sound natural.",
