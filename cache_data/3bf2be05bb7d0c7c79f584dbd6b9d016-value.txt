    "etymology": "The particle 「な」 is required between a な-adjective and a noun it modifies. This 「な」 serves as a connective, similar to 「の」 but specifically for な-adjectives. Without it, the adjective cannot directly modify the noun.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, adjectives can directly modify nouns, adding descriptive qualities. When using な-adjectives (also known as adjectival nouns) before a noun, the particle 「な」 is **required** between the adjective and the noun. This is because 「な」 acts as a connector, indicating that the adjective is describing a quality or characteristic of the noun.\n\n**Important Distinction:**\n\nMany words can take either 「な」 or 「の」 when describing a noun. While there may be some overlap, the nuances are distinct:\n\n*   **(A) な (B)**: (A) is a quality or feature of (B).\n*   **(A) の (B)**: (A) indicates the type, purpose, or association of (B).\n\nUnderstanding this distinction helps avoid misuse. Focus on whether you're describing a quality (use 「な」) or indicating the type/purpose (use 「の」).",
