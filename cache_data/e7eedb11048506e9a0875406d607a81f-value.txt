  "writeup": "The particle ぶり ni, derived from the noun 振り (buri, meaning \"style\" or \"manner\"), indicates a lapse of time since the last occurrence of an action or event.  It's often translated as \"for the first time in…\" or \"haven't… in…\".  Crucially, it follows a noun specifying the duration (e.g.,  \"one year,\" \"ten years\") and describes the subsequent action or experience.  The nuance emphasizes the infrequency or unexpected nature of the event after a considerable period. For instance, \"三年ぶりに雪を見た\" (sannenburi ni yuki o mita) highlights the rarity of seeing snow after three years. Note that while grammatically correct, using ぶり with very short timeframes like minutes or hours may sound unnatural. ",
  "etymology": "The word ぶり (buri) originates from the noun 振り (buri), meaning \"manner\" or \"style.\"  In this grammatical context, it shifts to denote a style or pattern of time's passage. The addition of the particle に (ni) further specifies the temporal aspect, marking the point in time after a certain period when an event occurs.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the time period described by the noun preceding ぶり ni should be significant.  While grammatically possible, using it with very short durations can sound unnatural.  The naturalness of the sentence often depends on the context and the emotional tone the speaker wants to convey.  The choice of verb form (plain, polite, etc.) also plays a crucial role in conveying register and politeness.",
