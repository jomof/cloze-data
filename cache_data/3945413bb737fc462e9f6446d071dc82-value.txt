    "etymology": "The grammar point 「まくる」 comes from the verb 捲る（めくる）, which means \"to roll up\" or \"to turn over.\" The imagery is one of doing something repeatedly, as if rolling something over and over again. The shift from めくる to まくる is a common sound change in Japanese.",
    "writeup": "「まくる」 is a verb suffix attached to the conjunctive form (連用形) of other verbs. It indicates that the action of the verb is performed **repeatedly**, **excessively**, or **with great intensity**. Think of it as doing something \"like crazy\" or doing \"nothing but\" that action.  It carries a nuance of doing something without restraint or considering the consequences. The base verb must be a volitional verb, meaning it describes an action that can be performed deliberately. While generally used in standard Japanese, the intensity of the meaning often lends itself to more casual contexts.  Be mindful that the implied lack of control or excess can sometimes carry a negative connotation depending on the context.",
