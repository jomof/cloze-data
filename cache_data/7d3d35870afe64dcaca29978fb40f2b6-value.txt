    "etymology": "The particle や has ancient roots, evolving from classical Japanese. Its core function has remained consistent: to indicate a non-exhaustive listing of items. It provides a sense of 'and so on' without explicitly stating it.",
    "writeup": "や is a particle with several roles in Japanese, most commonly used as an adverbial particle. Similar to と, it functions as \"and,\" but instead of listing specific items in a group exhaustively, it lists \"things like (A).\" や is exclusively used to group nouns, placed directly after them.\n\nTo illustrate the difference between と and や, imagine a fruit bowl containing apples, oranges, and peaches. Listing apples and oranges with と implies the absence of peaches, creating an exhaustive list. Conversely, using や indicates that other items exist in the bowl besides apples and oranges, making it suitable when you want to say \"and\" without limiting the group.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nや cannot be used after verb phrases. Use たり or とか for that purpose.",
