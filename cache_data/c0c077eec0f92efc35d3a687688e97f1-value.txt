  "writeup": "The phrase ではなくて／じゃなくて indicates a contrast, meaning 'not A, but B' or 'rather than A, B.'  It's a versatile construction used to express alternatives or corrections.  ではなくて uses the particle は, emphasizing the contrast between A and B, making it sound more natural.  The simpler form じゃなくて is more casual.  The choice between ではなくて and じゃなくて depends on context and desired level of formality.  Note that く form is the conjunctive form used with adjectives and other conjugatable words.  This form can directly attach to other conjugatable words to modify their meaning, which is a key difference from other similar expressions.  It's commonly used in both spoken and written Japanese. This construction is suitable for a broad range of situations, adding a sophisticated nuance to your speech. ",
  "etymology": "ではなくて is a combination of the copula だ (to be) in its negative form で は なくて, and じゃなくて is its more colloquial counterpart.  The ‘く’ form is a critical aspect of Japanese grammar, allowing for smooth transitions between clauses and nuanced expression. This conjunctive form provides a stylistic flexibility that enriches the flow of speech, especially in comparisons.",
