    "etymology": "「なさい」is derived from the honorific verb 「なさる」 (nasaru), which means \"to do.\" 「なさい」 is the imperative form of 「なさる」. It carries a nuance of respect while still being a command.",
    "writeup": "「なさい」 is the imperative form of 「なさる」, an honorific verb meaning \"to do.\" It indicates that the speaker is giving a polite command or instruction. While 「なさる」 shows respect, 「なさい」 is still a command, so it's generally used by superiors (parents, teachers) to inferiors (children, students). It is attached to the ます stem of a verb. \n\nFor example, 「食べなさい」 (tabenasai) means \"Eat!\" (polite). \n\n「なさい」 can be shortened to 「な」 in more casual speech, further softening the command. However, be careful not to confuse this 「な」 with the prohibitive 「な」 (meaning \"don't\"), which attaches to the dictionary form of a verb. \n\nExample: 「勉強しなさい」 (benkyou shinasai) - \"Study!\" (polite). Becomes 「勉強しな」 (benkyou shina) in casual speech. In contrast, 「勉強するな」 (benkyou suru na) means \"Don't study!\".",
