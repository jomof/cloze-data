        "Collocation": "The part before 「ない」 is often a verb, but can also be an adjective or noun depending on the sentence.",

    "writeup": "The grammar point 「何も〜ない」 expresses that there's **no need** or **no reason** to do something. It often carries a nuance of disagreement or questioning the necessity of an action. You will often hear it in casual conversations. The 「何も」 emphasizes that there is absolutely no need for the action or state being discussed. It can also imply a sense of surprise or disbelief that someone would even consider doing the action.",
