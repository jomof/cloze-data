    "writeup": "「ざるを得ない」 indicates that someone has no alternative but to perform a certain action. It conveys a sense of obligation or inevitability.  The 「ざる」 part is the attributive form of the archaic negative auxiliary verb 「ず」 (or 「ざり」), similar in meaning to 「ない」. 「を得ない」 literally means \"cannot obtain\" (the ability to avoid doing something). Therefore, 「ざるを得ない」 creates a double negative, implying that one \"cannot *not* do\" something, hence, they must do it.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   It attaches to the **negative plain form** of a verb.  For verbs ending in 「う」, 「く」, 「す」, 「つ」, 「ぬ」, 「ぶ」, 「む」, 「る」, 「る」, the 「ない」 form changes to 「～らない」, 「～かない」, etc., and then 「ない」 is replaced with 「ざるを得ない」.\n*   For the irregular verbs, 「する」 becomes 「せざるを得ない」 and 「くる」 becomes 「こざるを得ない」. This is a crucial exception to remember.\n*   The register is quite formal and stiff, making it more suitable for written Japanese or formal spoken situations.",
