    "etymology": "The auxiliary verbs れる and られる originate from the classical Japanese verbs *raru* (る) and *reru* (れ), which indicated spontaneity or respect. Over time, their usage expanded to include passive voice and potential, adding layers of nuance to the language.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point れる・られる is used to express passive voice, potential, spontaneous occurrences, or respect. Understanding its nuances is **essential** for interpreting Japanese sentences accurately.\n\nIn Japanese, passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is the recipient of an action. Unlike English passive voice, it often carries a sense of being affected or inconvenienced by the action. The person performing the action is marked with 「に」 or, if there's no direct contact, 「から」.\n\n*   **Conjugation:**\n    *   う-Verbs (Godan verbs): Change the final う sound to あ sound, then add れる or られる. Example: 読む (yomu) → 読まれる (yomareru).\n    *   る-Verbs (Ichidan verbs): Replace the final る with られる. Example: 食べる (taberu) → 食べられる (taberareru).\n    *   Special cases: する becomes される, and くる becomes こられる.\n\n*   **Usages:**\n    *   **Passive (受身):** Something is done to the subject by an external force, often with negative connotations.\n    *   **Potential (可能):** Expresses the ability or possibility to do something.  The ら can be dropped in this case, leading to 「ラ抜き言葉」.\n    *   **Spontaneous (自発):** Something happens naturally or without intention.\n    *   **Respectful (尊敬):** Used to show respect by making someone the subject of a sentence, even if they are not performing the action.\n\n*   **Important Considerations:**\n    *   The choice between れる and られる can depend on the verb type and the desired nuance. る-verbs often drop the ら (ラ抜き言葉) in potential form, but not in passive, spontaneous, or respectful forms.\n    *   Japanese passive voice often emphasizes the lack of control experienced by the subject.",
