    "writeup": "The noun **とおり** (通り in kanji) generally means \"street\" or \"way\". However, when used as a suffix, it signifies that something is **exactly** or **precisely** as something else. It indicates a level of sameness or correspondence. \n\n**Usage:**\n\n*   **Verbs:**  とおり is attached directly to the plain form or the past form of a verb (e.g., 言うとおり, 言ったとおり).\n*   **Nouns:**\n    *   **のとおり:** Used when the case-marking particle の comes between the noun and とおり (e.g., 計画のとおり).\n    *   **どおり:**  Attached directly to the noun (e.g., 計画どおり). This form is more common, especially in spoken Japanese.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Expressions like 「言った通り」 (just as I said) and 「その通り」 (that's right) are frequently used as polite ways to agree with someone.\n*   The choice between 「の」 and no 「の」 with nouns is mostly stylistic, with どおり being more colloquial.",
