  "writeup": "やがて, meaning 'before long,' is an adverb typically placed at the beginning of a sentence. It indicates that a state not currently present will occur in the (usually near) future.  Think of it as expressing an expectation or prediction of something happening soon.  Translations include 'before long,' 'in the end,' or 'eventually.'  While it's usually written in hiragana, understanding its nuance is key.  A crucial point:  when used with a specified timeframe, やがて can suggest 'almost' or 'nearly' rather than a precise duration.  Historically, やがて held broader meanings like 'namely,' 'immediately,' or 'in a moment,' reflecting its origin as a marker of something anticipated or known. This adds depth to its current use.",
  "etymology": "The adverb やがて originates from a combination of elements hinting at the future.  It's evolved from signifying anticipated events to specifically indicating their imminent occurrence within a relatively short timeframe.",
