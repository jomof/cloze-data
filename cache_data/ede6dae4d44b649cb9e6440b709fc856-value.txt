  "writeup": "The phrase \"以上 ②\" (ijō ②), when used with the adverbial particle は (wa),  functions as a formal conditional or causal conjunction, often translating to 'since (A), (B)', 'now that (A), (B)', or 'as long as (A), (B)'.  It's crucial to understand that this is a **formal structure** rarely used in casual conversation.  This construction works with verbs and い-adjectives in their dictionary forms, and with な-adjectives or nouns followed by である (de aru) 以上は (ijō wa).  The particle は (wa) is often omitted in practice, leaving just 以上 (ijō).  The meaning leans towards a consequence or necessary action (B) resulting from a given premise (A).  Think of it as stating the obvious or inevitable outcome of (A). Part (B) frequently involves expressions of obligation, intention, or expectation, such as べきだ (beki da), つもりだ (tsumori da), はずだ (hazu da), たい (tai), ほうがいい (hō ga ii), and similar constructions.  Interestingly, while the common translations are useful, the literal meaning, 'above and beyond (A), (B),' also serves as a helpful mnemonic, emphasizing that (B) is considered in light of what lies 'beyond' or 'past' (A).",

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The phrase 「会社に来ないでください」 (kaisha ni konaide kudasai) is a polite negative imperative form, fitting the formality of the sentence.

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「有名である以上は」 (yūmeide aru ijō wa) establishes the formal tone, which is essential in expressing the social responsibility of a public figure. The choice of 「気をつけなければいけません」 (ki o tsukenakereba ikemasen) conveys a sense of obligation appropriate for public figures. A younger person might use a more informal phrasing."

      "nuance": "The sentence structure 「この地域の住民である以上は...守るべきです」 (kono chiiki no jūmin de aru ijō wa... mamoru beki desu) uses the formal である (de aru) form, which is appropriate given the instruction's tone. The choice of 「守るべきです」 (mamorubeki desu) reinforces the sense of obligation and responsibility expected of community members. The formal register creates an authoritative tone in a community instructional scenario."

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "While still formal,  「約束した以上は」 (yakusoku shita ijō wa) allows for a slightly softer tone than the previous examples, suitable for a more personal setting.  It shows commitment without being overly stiff. The use of 「必ず来ます」 (kanarazu kimasu) reinforces the reliability of the speaker."

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The shift to casual register using 「よ」 (yo) and the exclamation mark conveys intimacy and affection. 「こんなに素敵なあなたと出会えた以上は」 (konna ni sutekina anata to deaeta ijō wa) is a highly romantic declaration which employs the grammar point with a casual ending."

Choose the expression that best matches the desired degree of formality and the strength of the implied consequence."
