  "writeup": "The particle として combines と, indicating a highlighted aspect, with the stem of する, meaning 'to do.'  It functions as an adverbial particle, directly modifying nouns.  It translates to 'as' when highlighting a specific role or function.  Think of it as presenting something (A) as the base from which to evaluate something else (B).  For example,  \"as a friend\" establishes the perspective from which a judgment about a person's character is made.  The use of と emphasizes a particular aspect, often while acknowledging other aspects exist. This grammar point is versatile and commonly used in standard Japanese.",
  "etymology": "として is a combination of the particle と, expressing a specific aspect or condition, and the verb する (suru) in its gerundive form して (shite).  The combination highlights a particular role or function, effectively translating to 'as' or 'in the capacity of'.",
