    "etymology": "The construction breaks down as follows: こと (thing, matter, fact) + は (topic marker) + A + が (but). The ことは part highlights the fact of 'A', while the が introduces a contrasting or qualifying statement.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ことは〜が」is used to acknowledge a certain fact (A), but then introduce a contrasting or qualifying statement (B). It conveys the meaning of \"It is true that A, but B\" or \"Although A, B.\" The same word or phrase is repeated before 「ことは」and after it, followed by 「が」or 「けれど/けど」. This repetition emphasizes the speaker's recognition of the initial fact, while also signaling a desire to express something contrary or limiting. It can be used with various parts of speech, but nouns require 「だ」before 「が」, and na-adjectives often use 「な」、「である」, 「だった」or 「ではない」.",
