  "writeup": "だけのことはある (dake no koto wa aru) is a Japanese expression that translates to \"it's only natural\" or \"no wonder.\" It emphasizes that a certain outcome is expected given the circumstances or prior actions.  The structure combines the particle だけ (dake, only), の (no, possessive), こと (koto, thing), は (wa, topic marker), and the verb ある (aru, to exist/be). It literally suggests that because of a certain fact, the result is unsurprising.  This phrase is commonly used to express positive assessments—it highlights that something positive is expected.  It's frequently paired with adverbs like さすが (sasuga, as expected) or やっぱり (yappari, as I thought) to amplify the sense of inevitability.  You can use this structure after verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns; な (na) is necessary after な-adjectives. For nouns and な-adjectives, you might see だっただけのことはある (datta dake no koto wa aru), emphasizing the result.  **Crucially**, だけのことはある is unsuitable for expressing negative expectations; it's reserved for positive outcomes.",
