  "writeup": "ところが is a conjunction in Japanese, combining the noun ところ 'place' and the conjunction particle が.  It highlights an unexpected result (B) following an expected situation (A), often translated as 'however' or 'despite that'.  It typically starts a new sentence, contrasting with the preceding one. This use of が is called 確定の逆接, indicating a contradictory conclusion.  Important Considerations:  Because とこらが emphasizes an unexpected outcome, it's used for situations beyond the speaker's control.  However, it *can* be used when the speaker attempts something, anticipating failure, but unexpectedly succeeds.  The nuance is subtle, and proper usage hinges on this understanding of unexpected outcomes.  It's a versatile conjunction frequently employed in casual conversation and formal writing alike, making it a valuable tool for expressing contrast and surprise.",
  "etymology": "The word とこらが is a combination of the noun ところ (tokoro), meaning 'place' or 'circumstance', and the particle が (ga), which in this context marks a contrastive element or unexpected turn of events.  The original meaning of ところ likely relates to the unexpected shift in the expected 'place' or 'state of affairs'.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "今日は早く起きないといけなかったから９時に寝た。**ところが**、目覚ましがならなかったから寝坊した。",
      "english": "I had to wake up early today, so I went to bed at 9.  **However**, my alarm didn't go off, so I overslept.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a casual register, suitable for a conversation between friends.  The use of  「ところが」 perfectly captures the unexpected nature of the speaker's oversleeping.  The straightforward explanation doesn’t have any overt gender or age implications."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "新しい洗濯機を買った。**ところが**、洗濯機が大きすぎて家に入らなかった。",
      "english": "I bought a new washing machine. **But**, it was too big to fit in the house.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register is again appropriate for a relaxed conversation. The sentence structure and vocabulary choice do not suggest any specific gender or age. The use of 「ところが」 introduces the unexpected problem."

    {
      "japanese": "彼にデートに誘ってみた。**ところが**、彼は既に彼女がいた。",
      "english": "I tried asking him out. **However**, he already had a girlfriend.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The slightly more formal register reflects a more self-reflective tone. The use of 「彼に」 indicates the speaker is female. 「ところが」 makes the unexpected nature of his having a girlfriend clear.  This is how a young woman might recount a frustrating experience."

    {
      "japanese": "一生懸命勉強した。**ところが**、試験に落ちてしまった。",
      "english": "I studied really hard. **But**, I still failed the exam.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "melancholic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual nature reflects the speaker's disappointment. There's nothing inherently gendered about the sentence structure, although the situation could be experienced by either gender.  「ところが」 expresses the unexpected and disappointing outcome."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "雨だと思っていた。**ところが**、晴れた。",
      "english": "I thought it would rain. **However**, it turned out sunny.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual tone fits everyday conversation. 「ところが」 clearly indicates the contrast between expectation and reality. The sentence structure and vocabulary are gender-neutral."

      "japanese": "料理を作った。ところが、彼が先にご飯を食べてしまった。",
      "english": "I made dinner. However, he ate all the food.",
      "register": "shitashii kuchō",
      "setting": "intimate",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The intimate register shows closeness between the speaker and listener; using 「彼が」 instead of 「彼」 is quite common and adds a gentle touch. The use of 「ところが」 shows the unexpected event, highlighting the annoyance in a playful manner.  This is a kind of intimate complaint."

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal register suits a professional setting.  The use of 「社長」 and the respectful verb conjugation show a formal tone. 「ところが」 provides the unexpected contrast between expectation and reality."

      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This flirty sentence is common among young people, and the use of 「君」 adds a bit of informality and closeness. The particle 「の？」 at the end adds curiosity and anticipation. The use of 「ところが」 creates a little tension; it's like testing the waters."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the effectiveness of とこらが relies on the contrast between expectation and unexpected outcome.  The context should always make the unexpected turn clear to the listener.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "が (subject marker)",
      "nuance": "Unlike とこらが, which indicates a contrasting result, が simply marks the grammatical subject of a sentence."

      "term": "却って (wakatte)",
      "nuance": "While both can express contrast, 却って implies an ironic or unexpected negative consequence, whereas とこらが simply notes an unexpected outcome, which may be positive or negative."

      "term": "だが・ですが (daga/desuga)",
      "nuance": "だが/ですが are more general-purpose conjunctions indicating contrast, whereas とこらが emphasizes the unexpected nature of the outcome."
    },
    {
      "term": "それでも (soredemo)",
      "nuance": "それでも emphasizes the continuation of an action or state despite the contrast, while とこらが primarily points out the contrasting outcome itself."

      "term": "けれども (keredomo)",
      "nuance": "けれども is a more formal and literary way of expressing contrast; とこらが is more common in everyday speech."
    },
    {
      "term": "けど・だけど (kedo/dakedo)",
      "nuance": "けど/だけど are informal equivalents of けれども; とこらが carries a stronger implication of an unexpected turn of events."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, carefully consider the nuance of each word.  とこらが specifically emphasizes an unexpected result contrasting with prior expectations.  Other conjunctions expressing contrast may lack this crucial element of surprise."
