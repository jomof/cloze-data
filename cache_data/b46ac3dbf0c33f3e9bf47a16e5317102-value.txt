        "Verb[masu-stem] + conjunction": "Connects consecutive or simultaneous actions."

    "jlpt": null,
    "meaning": "Treats the verb's ます-stem as a conjunction, linking consecutive or simultaneous actions (like \"and\" or \"then\").",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Varies depending on the verb used.",
        "Function": "To connect two or more actions performed in sequence or simultaneously.",
        "Connotation": "Imparts a sense of continuation or progression.",
        "Usage": "Common in both spoken and written Japanese, providing a smooth transition between actions."
    },
    "etymology": "The ます-stem of a verb is derived by removing the ます ending from the polite ます form. This stem is then used to connect clauses, functioning similarly to the English word \"and.\" It implies a sequence or simultaneity of actions. The ます form itself comes from the auxiliary verb ます, which indicates politeness. This usage of the ます-stem leverages the polite form's inherent ability to link smoothly within sentences.",
    "writeup": "The ます-stem conjunction is a versatile grammatical tool that connects verbs, indicating sequential or simultaneous actions. It's formed by taking the ます-stem of a verb (removing ます) and using it to link clauses. This construction avoids abrupt breaks in the sentence, creating a smoother flow. The register of the sentence will be determined by the forms of the surrounding verbs and other grammatical elements.",
