  "writeup": "The grammar point \"であれ\" (deare) functions as a formal, emphatic way to express \"even if\" or \"no matter.\" It's an extension of \"である\" (de aru), the formal copula, combining the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb \"だ\" (da) and the imperative form of the verb \"ある\" (aru, 'to exist').  This construction emphasizes the irrelevance of the preceding clause to the following one, conveying a strong sense of conviction or determination.  It's often used with words like \"どんな\" (donna, 'what kind of') or \"たとえ\" (tatoe, 'even if') to introduce a conditional clause. Because it uses structures that inherently indicate a strong will, \"であれ\" is frequently found in sentences expressing opinions or resolutions. The alternative form, であろうと (dearouto), uses the volitional form, adding a nuance of stronger intent or insistence.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "子供**であれ**、法律は守らなくてはいけない。",
      "english": "Even if you are a child, you must obey the law.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the formal register, appropriate for conveying rules or expectations.  The use of \"法律は守らなくてはいけない\" (houhoutsu wa mamoranakute wa ikenai, 'must obey the law') reinforces the imperative nature of the statement."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "理由が何**であれ**、家族や友達を裏切るのはよくないと思う。",
      "english": "No matter the reason, I think betraying family and friends is wrong.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The \"何であれ\" (nandeare) part emphasizes the speaker's strong conviction, regardless of any explanation."

      "japanese": "いくらあなたが年上**であろうと**、ここでは一応私が先輩なので私の言うことに従ってください。",
      "english": "No matter how much older you are, I'm your senior here, so please follow my instructions.",
      "register": "teineigo",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This example uses the polite form \"従ってください\" (sittte kudasai, 'please follow') and the more forceful \"であろうと\" (dearouto), reflecting a formal workplace setting where seniority dictates behaviour. The phrase 「私の言うことに従ってください」 (watashi no iu koto ni shitte kudasai) is highly polite."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "上司からのメール：インフルエンザ**であろうと**、会社にはきてください。",
      "english": "Email from your boss: Even if you have the flu, please come to work.",
      "register": "teineigo",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The email uses a polite but firm tone, typical of boss-employee communication.  The use of \"であろうと\" (dearouto) emphasizes the boss's expectation despite the employee's illness. The imperative 「きてください」 (kite kudasai, 'please come') is polite."

      "japanese": "友人の家**であれ**、訪問時は靴を脱ぐことが、基本的な礼儀です。",

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the formal register to convey a general rule of etiquette.  The phrase \"基本的な礼儀です\" (kihon teki na reigi desu, 'is basic etiquette') is formal and impersonal. The use of であれ is subtle, adding a touch of formality."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "たとえ氷のように純粋**であれ**、世界の悪からは免れられないだろう。",
      "english": "Even if you're as pure as ice, you can't escape the evils of the world.",
      "register": "literary",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses evocative imagery (\"氷のように純粋\" -  'pure as ice') and a somewhat pessimistic tone, making the literary register appropriate. The sentence structure is grammatically complex which also contributes to its literary register."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "たとえ小さなもので**あれ**、検察官は賄賂を受け取るわけにはいかない。",
      "english": "Even a small bribe is unacceptable for a prosecutor.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "legal",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal register and legal subject matter demand a precise and unambiguous phrasing.  The use of \"わけにはいかない\" (wake ni wa ikanai, 'cannot be helped') further strengthens the statement's formal tone."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the choice between であれ and であろうと subtly changes the level of emphasis and assertiveness.  であれ is more suitable for general statements, whereas であろうと leans towards stronger declarations of intent or resolution.  Mastering this nuance will significantly enhance your ability to express conviction in Japanese.",

    }

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to distinguishing these similar expressions lies in their subtle differences in meaning and emphasis.  であれ focuses exclusively on the irrelevance of a condition; others introduce choices or concessions, or provide reasons.  Pay close attention to the overall context and the nuanced meanings to choose the appropriate expression."
