    "etymology": "に引き換え is derived from the particle に, the conjunctive form of the verb 引く (hiku, \"to pull\"), and the conjunctive form of the verb 換える (kaeru, \"to exchange\" or \"to switch\"). The literal meaning is akin to \"pulling back and switching away from\" something.",
    "writeup": "に引き換え (ni hikikae) is used to make a stark comparison or contrast between two things. It translates to \"in contrast to (A), (B)\" or \"while (A), (B)\". The contrast often involves one thing being considered positive and the other negative, based on the speaker's subjective opinion.\n\nに引き換え can follow almost any noun, but it requires a の before い-adjectives or verbs, and なの before な-adjectives. The contrasted items (A) and (B) should be plainly observable or measurable facts, not assumptions or guesses.\n\nIt's also acceptable to use それにひきかえ at the start of a sentence when the contrast refers back to a previous statement. **Pay attention to the kanji of 引き換え to avoid confusion with other similar-sounding grammar.**",
