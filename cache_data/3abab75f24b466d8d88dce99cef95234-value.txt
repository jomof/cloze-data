    "etymology": "まで is derived from the classical Japanese word 許(まで) which meant 'to allow,' 'to the extent of.' The usage evolved to indicate a limit or boundary, eventually becoming the modern particle まで, signifying 'until' or 'to.'",
    "writeup": "まで is a particle indicating a limit or endpoint. When attached to a verb, it generally translates to \"until (something) happens.\" It specifies the duration of an action or state, marking the end point. **Importantly**, まで is used with verbs in the non-past tense. The overall tense of the sentence is determined by the context or verbs later in the sentence. When used with a location, it shows the final destination.",
