    "writeup": "「ずに済む」 is a Japanese grammar construction that expresses the idea of being able to **manage without doing something**, or **getting away with not doing something**. It combines 「ず」, which functions similarly to 「ない」 to negate a verb, with 「に」, and the verb 「済む」 (すむ), meaning \"to come to an end,\" \"to be settled,\" or \"to get by.\"  The literal sense is akin to \"it concludes without doing (something).\"\n\n「ず」 attaches to verbs in the same way as 「ない」, so the structure appears after the verb being negated.  While 「ずに済む」 is common, you might also encounter 「ないですむ」 or 「なしですむ」 with similar meanings. 「無しで」 acts like a suffix and can follow nouns directly, unlike 「ないで」 and 「ずに」.\n\nOften, the action avoided is something considered **unpleasant, bothersome, or undesirable**, highlighting the speaker's relief or satisfaction at not having to do it.",
