  "writeup": "には is a common particle combination in Japanese used to express contrast regarding the topic.  に highlights that something is 'for (A)', while は emphasizes a generalization or contrast about (A). Common translations include 'in order to,' 'in regard to,' or 'for.' This structure follows verbs in their dictionary form or nouns.  Despite having several translations, には can almost always be considered 'for,' as に shows (A) as the 'target,' and は shows that what happens in (B) is specific to (A), regardless of other topics.  Understanding this nuance is key to mastering its usage.",
  "etymology": "The particle に indicates direction or purpose, specifying the target or recipient of an action. The particle は marks the topic of the sentence, setting the focus.  The combination of に and は creates a nuanced expression that highlights both the target of the action and the specific context in which that action occurs, resulting in the contrastive meaning inherent in には.",
