    "etymology": "The word 「自分」 is composed of 「自」 (ji), meaning 'self,' and 「分」 (bun), meaning 'part' or 'portion.' The combination suggests 'one's own part' or 'one's own being.'",
    "writeup": "「自分」 is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence. It is similar to \"oneself\" in English and can be used for any person (first, second, or third) depending on the context. It's **important** to understand that 「自分」 indicates a sense of self-reference or personal involvement. It can also be used to emphasize personal responsibility or ownership. While it can refer to any person, the nuance often implies that the subject is acting on their own volition or considering their own perspective. In some contexts, especially in sports or group settings, it can also refer to 'one's role'.",
