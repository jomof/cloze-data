    "etymology": "続ける (tsuzukeru) is derived from the verb 続く (tsuzuku), meaning \"to continue\" or \"to last.\" The addition of the causative/transitive ending \"-keru\" transforms it into a transitive verb, meaning \"to continue something.\"",
    "writeup": "The verb 続ける (tsuzukeru), meaning \"to continue,\" is attached to the stem of another verb to express the continuation of an action. This grammar point emphasizes the ongoing nature of the activity. For example, 走り続ける (hashiri tsuzukeru) means \"to continue running.\"\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   The nuance differs slightly from using the て-form + verb. Attaching 続ける directly to the verb stem implies that the action is being done *in the manner of* the other verb, emphasizing the sustained effort. Using the て-form suggests a sequence of actions or a cause-and-effect relationship.\n*   始める (hajimeru), meaning \"to start,\" is the antonym of 続ける (tsuzukeru).",
