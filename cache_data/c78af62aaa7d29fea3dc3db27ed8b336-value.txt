    "etymology": "The expression 「わけにはいかない」 combines 「わけ」 (wake), meaning 'reason,' 'cause,' or 'circumstance,' with the particle 「に」 (ni), the contrastive particle 「は」 (wa), and the verb 「いかない」 (ikanai), the negative form of 「いく」 (iku), meaning 'to go.' Literally, it suggests that 'due to a certain reason, things cannot proceed or go in a certain direction.'",
    "writeup": "「わけにはいかない」 expresses that something is **impossible** or **unacceptable** due to external circumstances, social norms, or personal reasons. It combines 「わけ」 (reason), 「に」 (case marking particle), 「は」 (adverbial particle), and 「いかない」 (cannot go). The literal sense is close to \"it cannot be so that (A).\" It's used after the dictionary form of a verb to highlight the undesirability or unattainability of an action. It can imply a sense of regret, similar to the English expression \"I guess it's just not meant to be so.\"",

            "register": "semi-formal",
            "setting": "humorous",
            "nuance": "「わけにはいかない」 expresses obligation due to the wife's effort. The speaker acknowledges the possibility of the food tasting bad 「不味くても」, but emphasizes the inability to refuse eating it due to the wife's efforts 「妻が頑張って作ってくれた」. This highlights the social pressure and gratitude involved.",
            "etymology": "「やつ」 is a casual term for 'thing' or 'stuff,' often used in informal speech to refer to something previously mentioned or understood in context."

            "etymology": "「人手」 (hitode) literally means 'person's hand' but is used to mean manpower or help."
