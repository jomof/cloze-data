    "etymology": "The particle 「に」, in this context, adds a nuance of emphasis or emotion to the hypothetical statement. It's related to the use of 「に」 to indicate a cause or reason, implying that the speaker is dwelling on the consequences of a different choice or situation. Over time, this has evolved into an expression of regret or sympathy.",
    "writeup": "The 「に」 particle, when used at the end of a sentence, expresses a feeling of regret, disappointment, or wistful thinking about a hypothetical situation. It suggests that things could have been different, often implying a sense of blame or self-reproach. Think of it as saying \"if only...\" or \"should have...\" with a bit of emotional weight.\n\nIt's often used with the past form of verbs and adjectives, and it can be combined with 「でしょう」 or 「だろう」 to add a level of conjecture. It is similar to のに, but expresses stronger regret or disappointment.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The level of regret can vary depending on the context and the speaker's tone.\n*   It's more common in spoken language when expressing personal feelings.",
