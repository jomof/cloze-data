  "writeup": "前に (maeni) is a versatile particle indicating time or location.  It means \"before\" in terms of time or \"in front of\" regarding location.  It's used with both verbs (in their non-past form) and nouns.  When used with nouns, the particle の must precede 前に.  For example,  \"銀行の前にある\" (ginkou no mae ni aru) means \"is in front of the bank.\"  This particle is fundamental and commonly used in everyday conversation. The nuance is straightforward—it simply denotes precedence in time or space.  Mastering its use is key to forming clear and natural Japanese sentences.  Its simplicity makes it an excellent early-stage grammatical tool.",
  "etymology": "The word 前 (mae) means \"front\" or \"before.\" The particle に (ni) marks the location or time.  Therefore, 前に literally means \"to the front/before,\" indicating a point in space or time.",
