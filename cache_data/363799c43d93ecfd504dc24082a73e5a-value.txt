  "writeup": "ため (or 為 in its kanji form) is a noun in Japanese that translates closely to 'sake' in English.  However, it's a non-independent word, always needing a connected word to clarify the 'sake' it emphasizes. The particle に often follows ため, indicating that (A) is a goal. Thus, ために translates as 'for the sake of (A)' or 'in order to (A)'. Attach it to a verb's non-past form or a noun followed by の.  Interestingly, ため can also highlight past events and their results, making 'in light of (A)' a more accurate overall translation. When focusing on past events, it might translate as 'due to' or 'because of'.",
  "etymology": "The word ため comes from the noun 為 (ため), meaning 'cause' or 'sake'. The particle に adds the sense of purpose or direction.",
