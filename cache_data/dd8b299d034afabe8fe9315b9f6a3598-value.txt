  "writeup": "そう is a versatile auxiliary verb, often translated as \"seems,\" \"appears,\" or \"looks like.\"  It's used to express an assumption or inference based on observation, often with a degree of uncertainty.  This contrasts with similar expressions like みたい which convey a stronger sense of likelihood. We will focus on its usage with the stem form of verbs and i-adjectives.  A key nuance is the addition of さ between な and そう when used with the negative i-adjective ない (e.g., なさそう). This grammatical quirk stems from the nature of ない as an auxiliary verb in this context.  Remember, そう is best suited for expressing less certain predictions or observations based on appearances—not for stating obvious facts.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of そう is complex and debated.  Its core meaning likely relates to a visual or sensory impression, developing over time into a more general expression of supposition or conjecture. Its use as an auxiliary verb reflects the broader evolution of Japanese grammar towards expressing nuanced shades of meaning.",
