  "writeup": "に当たり or に当たって is a formal Japanese grammar pattern conveying 'at the time of (A)', 'when doing (A)', or 'on the occasion of (A)'.  Similar to に際して ('on the occasion of (A)'), it's often used regarding preparations for future events.  This structure combines に and the 'u'-verb 当たる ('to hit' or 'to come into contact') in its formal-conjunctive or て-form. に当たり follows verbs in their dictionary form or nouns.  Two primary nuances exist:\n\n1.  When (A) is a special occasion or condition from which (B) arises.\n2. When (A) is a goal or target, and (B) is the responsive measure.\n\n**Important Consideration:** Unlike に際して, which can apply to positive or negative situations, に当たり is mainly used for positive or neutral contexts.",
  "etymology": "The grammar point derives from the verb 当たる (ataru), meaning \"to hit,\" \"to coincide,\" or \"to apply to.\"  In this context, it signifies the point in time when something is relevant or applicable, thus creating the nuance of 'at the time of,' 'when doing,' etc. The use of the conjunctive/て-form adds formality and creates a more nuanced expression of the timing and purpose of an action.",
