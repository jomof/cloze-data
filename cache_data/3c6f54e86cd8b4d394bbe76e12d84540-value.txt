    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ごとし」 is used to express that something is **like** or **similar to** something else. It carries a nuance of resemblance, analogy, or approximation. Often found in more formal or literary contexts, it adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to the expression. It can translate to \"like,\" \"similar to,\" or \"as if.\" 「ごとし」 can connect to nouns directly with the particle 「の」. When it connects to verbs, it uses the form 「がごとし」 or 「かのごとし」. There are similar grammar points such as 「ようだ」, 「みたいだ」, and 「かのように」.",
    "etymology": "「ごとし」 has roots in classical Japanese and is related to the verb 「言う (いう)」, meaning \"to say.\" Over time, it evolved to express resemblance or comparison, effectively meaning \"as it says\" or \"as it appears.\"",
