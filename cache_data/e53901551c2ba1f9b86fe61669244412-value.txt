    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from the particle 「を」 and the te-form of the verb 「込める (こめる)」, meaning \"to include, to put into, to load with\". Thus, literally, it means something is being put into or loaded with something else, specifically feelings or emotions.",
    "writeup": "「を込めて」 (o komete), often written in kanji as 「を込めて」, expresses that something is \"full of\" or \"filled with\" a particular feeling or emotion. It combines the particle 「を」 with the te-form of the verb 「込める (こめる)」, which means \"to pack into\" or \"to load with.\" The phrase is typically used when a specific feeling or emotion is being imbued into an action or object. It's **important** to treat this structure as a set phrase, typically used when a particular feeling or emotion is being \"packed into\" something.",
