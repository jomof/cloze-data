    "etymology": "The term 「塗れ」 (mamire) comes from the verb 「塗れる」 (mamireru), which is related to 「塗る」 (nuru, to paint or smear). It carries the image of something being thoroughly covered as if painted all over.",
    "writeup": "「塗れ」(mamire), generally written in hiragana, signifies that something is 'completely covered in (A)', 'smeared all over with (A)', or 'stained with (A)'. It attaches directly to nouns and can appear as 「まみれの」 when modifying another noun. In most cases, 「まみれ」 is used for things that are negative or perceived negatively, like blood 「血」, mud 「泥」, oil 「油」, debt 「借金」, or even desires.",
