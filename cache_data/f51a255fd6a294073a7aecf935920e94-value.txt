  "writeup": "The expression と同時に (to dōjini) elegantly conveys simultaneity in Japanese.  It's a nuanced construction combining the particle と (to), used here to list items, the noun 同時 (dōji) meaning 'simultaneous' or 'at the same time,' and the particle に (ni), indicating a point in time.  Think of it as 'at the same time as (A),' 'the instant that (A),' or 'along with (A).'  In usage, (A) is the primary event, but any accompanying events (B, C, etc.) remain equally significant.  With nouns and な-adjectives, the copula である (de aru) is often omitted for a smoother flow.  Interestingly, while literally meaning 'at the same time,' と同時に is frequently employed to list multiple roles or functions, conveying a sense of 'as well as,' retaining that simultaneous nuance.  Mastering this subtly powerful expression will greatly enhance your Japanese conversational skills.",
  "etymology": "と同時に is formed from three elements: と (to), a particle indicating listing; 同時 (dōji), meaning \"simultaneous\" or \"at the same time,\" composed of 同 (dō), meaning \"same,\" and 時 (ji), meaning \"time\"; and に (ni), a particle indicating time or location.  The combination beautifully expresses the simultaneous occurrence of two or more events.",
