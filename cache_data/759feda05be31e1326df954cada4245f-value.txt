  "writeup": "ふりをする is a common Japanese expression meaning \"to pretend\" or \"to act as if.\"  It's constructed from the noun 振り (furi, \"shake, manner\"), the particle を (o), and the verb する (suru, \"to do\").  The overall meaning conveys the act of outwardly displaying a behavior or appearance different from one's inner state.  While often translated as simply \"to pretend,\"  it emphasizes the outward display of a specific behavior.  The nuance is subtler than simply pretending; it suggests a conscious effort to project a particular image or impression. This expression is versatile and usable across many registers, although overly casual forms should be avoided in formal settings. The verb する allows for various conjugations, adding flexibility to express different tenses and politenesses.",
  "etymology": "The word 振り (furi) originates from the verb 振る (furu), meaning \"to shake\" or \"to wave.\" In this context, it evolved to represent the act of \"shaking off\" or \"putting on\" a certain demeanor or mannerism, thus implying a pretense.",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference between ふりをする and っぽい lies in intentionality. ふりをする implies a conscious act of deception or projection, whereas っぽい simply suggests a resemblance or characteristic.  Choosing between these depends on whether you want to highlight deliberate pretense or merely a similarity."
