    "writeup": "「それ」 is a pronoun (代名詞, *daimeishi*) that translates to \"that\" in English. It points to something closer to the listener than the speaker, either physically or conceptually.\n\n「それ」 can also refer back to something previously mentioned in the conversation, whether in the same sentence or by another speaker. Think of it as a way to say, \"That thing we were just talking about.\"\n\n*   「これ」 refers to something close to the speaker.\n*   「あれ」 refers to something distant from both the speaker and listener.",

            "listener_gender": "male",
            "nuance": "「きのう言ってたおもしろい話」 establishes a shared context. 「まさか{それ}がほんとうだなんて」 uses 「それ」 to refer to the content of the 'interesting story', implying a playful disbelief.

            "listener_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「{それ}にしても」 connects the speaker's prior statement (\"It's my first time trying this dish\") with the subsequent observation (\"it's delicious\"). 「それ」 here refers to the situation of it being their first time.
