    "etymology": "ので is etymologically derived from the て-form of the explanatory のだ (or んです). Over time, it has evolved into a distinct conjunctive particle, separate from its origin, and indicating reason or cause.",
    "writeup": "ので is a conjunctive particle used to connect two parts of a sentence, indicating a reason or cause. It is similar to から, often translated as \"because,\" \"so,\" or \"since.\" When connecting な-adjectives or nouns, な must precede ので. Unlike から, ので tends to be more objective, focusing on facts rather than feelings. から, conversely, can be more subjective and vague. ので can be seen as んで in casual speech. Unlike many other grammar points that connect to verbs, ので can be used with the ます form, a unique characteristic of conjunctive particles.",
