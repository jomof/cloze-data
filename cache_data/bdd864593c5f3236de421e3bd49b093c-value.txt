  "writeup": "とき, or 時 in kanji, is a versatile noun signifying 'when' something occurs.  Unlike some temporal expressions, とき primarily describes events happening at regular intervals (habits, hobbies) or broad, individual occurrences (when it rains, a shop sale). Its usage is straightforward: attach it to the end of any independent word (verbs, nouns, adjectives).  Remember な after な-adjectives and の after nouns. The particle に typically follows 時, indicating a subsequent verb.  Importantly, とき emphasizes one event leading to another, not a static state. For instance, it wouldn't naturally describe \"the time you tripped\"—instead focusing on the action and its consequence.  Consider carefully its suitability to avoid unnatural-sounding sentences.",
