    "etymology": "ことだから is derived from the noun こと (koto) meaning \"thing,\" the copula だ (da), and the particle から (kara) indicating \"from\" or \"because.\" Thus, the literal breakdown suggests something along the lines of \"from the fact that it's (A), then (B) follows.\"",
    "writeup": "ことだから is a set expression used to express a high degree of certainty about a subsequent statement (B), based on previous experience or known information about a prior situation or person (A). It suggests a logical connection between (A) and (B), implying that (B) is a natural consequence of (A).\n\nIt can be translated as \"it is exactly because (A) that (B)\", \"precisely because it is (A), (B)\", or \"given that (A) is the case, then (B) is expected.\"\n\nIt is often used when (A) is a well-known characteristic or habitual behavior. It can also be used when (A) presents a good opportunity to do (B).\n\nDespite these slight nuances, the speaker's intended meaning is usually clear from the context. Essentially, it conveys that \"by the logic of (A), definitely (B).\"",
