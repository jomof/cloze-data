  "writeup": "The sentence ending particle \"んだって\" is a casual way of expressing something you've heard from someone else.  It's a combination of \"ん (n)\", which softens the statement,  \"だ (da)\", the copula indicating a factual statement, and \"って (tte)\", a quotative particle indicating reported speech.  Think of it as a more informal and emphatic version of \"～と言っていた (～to itte ita)\" or \"～と聞いた (～to kiita)\".  It implies a sense of surprise, amusement, or relaying gossip.  Because of its informal nature, it's primarily used among close friends or family. Using it with superiors or strangers would be inappropriate.",
  "etymology": "んだって is a contraction of ん + だ + って. ん is a softening particle. だ is the copula, meaning 'is' or 'am'. って is a quotative particle, derived from と言って (to itte), meaning 'saying that' or 'said that'.  The combination creates a colloquial way of reporting what someone else said, with an implication that the speaker is sharing this information.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "さくらちゃんが来年結婚する**んだって**。うらやましいね。",
      "english": "I heard Sakura-chan is getting married next year.  That's awesome!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the casual form \"んだって\", appropriate for a friendly conversation among peers. The expression \"うらやましいね\" further emphasizes the casual and friendly tone."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "たけしくんが新しいおもちゃが欲しい**んだって**？どうしよう？買ってあげる？",
      "english": "Takeru-kun wants a new toy, huh? What should we do? Should we get him one?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "intimate",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of  \"んだって\" shows a shared understanding and closeness between the speakers. The question \"買ってあげる？\" (Shall I buy it for him?) further strengthens the intimate relationship.  The sentence is more likely to be spoken by a female, as asking this type of question in such a tone is more typical of a female."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの博士は凄いことを言っているように聞こえるけど、実は言っていること全部適当**なんだって**。",
      "english": "That professor sounds like he's saying amazing things, but apparently, it's all just hot air.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses \"んだって\" to casually relay some gossip or surprising information. The use of \"実は\" (actually) further emphasises that the information is surprising."

    {
      "japanese": "タクミさんはレスラーみたいな体してるけど、好きなスポーツはフィギュアスケート**なんだって**！",
      "english": "Takumi-san has a wrestler's build, but I heard his favorite sport is figure skating!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "nuance": "The exclamation point and the surprising contrast between Takumi's appearance and his hobby make this sentence particularly suitable for a humorous context. The use of \"んだって\" enhances the casual and surprised tone of the statement."

    {
      "japanese": "ねえ、私のこと好き**なんだって**？",
      "english": "Hey, I heard you like me?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of ねえ (nee) and the flirtatious implication adds to the casualness.  The phrase 「私のこと好き」 (my thing like) is a more roundabout way of saying \"you like me\", which is more typically female speech. This phrasing adds subtlety and intrigue to the flirtation."

    {
      "japanese": "週末、一緒に映画見に行かない？…って、聞いている**んだって**？",

      "setting": "first-date",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The initial invitation is a bit more straightforward, but the final phrase uses \"んだって\" to express a shy, playful uncertainty about how to proceed, in a way that shows a certain amount of social grace. It's more formal in tone than the other examples."
    }

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the appropriateness of \"んだって\" hinges entirely on context and your relationship with the listener.  Overusing it in formal settings or with strangers will sound childish and inappropriate.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, carefully consider the nuance and context.  If you're conveying a casually relayed piece of information with a bit of surprise or emphasis, んだって is your best choice. If you need a more formal or neutral expression of hearsay, opt for と聞いた or other alternatives. The multiple meanings of だって require close attention to context to avoid misinterpretations."
