    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ばかりでなく」 is derived from 「ばかり」 (bakari, meaning 'just', 'only', 'nothing but') and 「でなく」, which is the negative form of 「だ」 (da, the copula 'to be'). Thus, the combination creates the sense of 'not only'.",
    "writeup": "「ばかりでなく」 is used to express that something is 'not only A, but also B' or 'as well as'. It indicates that something has additional qualities or characteristics beyond what is initially stated. 「ばかり」 functions as an adverbial particle, and 「でなく」 is a conjugated, negated form of the auxiliary verb 「だ」. Other forms include 「でなくて」, 「ではなく」, 「ではなくて」, 「じゃなく」, and 「じゃなくて」. Adding the particle 「は」 emphasizes the negation further. 「ばかりでなく」 is more formal than 「だけでなく」, with the latter being more common in everyday speech.",
