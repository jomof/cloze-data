  "writeup": "Almost always written purely in hiragana, まさか (masaka) is a combination of まさ (masa), a noun meaning 'precise' or 'exact', and the adverbial particle か (ka). In modern Japanese, まさか is considered a single adverb meaning 'it can't be true', 'no way', or 'don't tell me'.  As it's primarily treated as an adverb, まさか most often appears at the beginning of a sentence, preceding a statement that surprises the speaker.  It's important to note the nuance of disbelief or astonishment it conveys.  The word carries a strong emotional weight, implying genuine surprise or even incredulity.  This makes it suitable for expressing shock, disbelief, or astonishment.  It's versatile and can be used in both casual and formal settings, though the context and accompanying words can modify the level of formality.  \n\n**Fun Fact:** まさ (masa) comes from 正 (masa), meaning 'precise' or 'actual'. However, this noun is rarely used in modern Japanese. まさに (masani) is an adverb meaning 'precisely,' while まさか (masaka) expresses disbelief.  However, the literal meaning of まさか is closer to 'is it true?' or 'is it actually?', due to か's role in forming questions.",
  "etymology": "The word まさか (masaka) is a fascinating example of semantic shift in Japanese.  The original components, まさ (masa) from 正 (correct, accurate) and か (ka) a question particle, combined to form an expression of incredulity.  The modern usage largely disregards the original literal meaning of a question, instead focusing on the implication of surprise and disbelief.",
