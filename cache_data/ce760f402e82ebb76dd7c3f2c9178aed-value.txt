    "etymology": "「すでに」 comes from the verb 「過ぐ (sugu)」 meaning \"to pass\" or \"to exceed\". The past form of this verb, 「過ぎに (sugini)」, evolved into 「すでに」, implying that something has already passed or occurred.",
    "writeup": "「すでに」 is a formal alternative to 「もう」, meaning \"already\". Unlike 「もう」, 「すでに」 often implies that the action or state is complete and unchangeable, sometimes carrying a nuance of \"too late\". It emphasizes that something has **already** happened, often with the implication that it is a fait accompli. While 「もう」 can sometimes express anticipation or expectation, 「すでに」 focuses on the completed nature of the event.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   「すでに」 is generally used in more formal contexts than 「もう」.\n*   It can imply a sense of finality or irreversibility.\n*   It can also be used to emphasize that something was known or understood beforehand.",
