    "writeup": "上に is a grammar pattern that functions as a slightly formal way of saying \"and\" in Japanese. It indicates that something (B) is added to something else (A), meaning \"in addition to (A)\", \"as well as (A)\", or \"besides (A)\".  Literally, it conveys the idea of \"on top of (A), (B)\". 上に can be used after the plain form of verbs and い-adjectives. For な-adjectives and nouns, it follows な (な上に) or の (の上に).  Occasionally, the に can be omitted without changing the meaning. For な-adjectives and nouns, using である上に is also common.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   上に is used to connect items or qualities of a similar nature. This means you typically use it to list good things with other good things, or bad things with other bad things.\n*   Avoid using 上に to connect contrasting ideas or things with opposite qualities.",
