  "writeup": "てならない is a grammatical construction in Japanese, formed by combining the て-form of a verb or adjective (で for な-adjectives) with the negative form of the verb なる (naru), meaning \"to become.\"  This creates an expression signifying an intense or uncontrollable feeling or state.  It suggests the feeling is so strong that the speaker cannot help but experience it. A more literal translation might be \"unable to escape from (feeling A)\" or \"to not be able to move on from (A)\".  It's crucial to understand that this construction emphasizes a sustained, ongoing feeling, rather than a fleeting emotion.  The nuance suggests that the feeling is natural and almost involuntary, not something the speaker can easily control or dismiss.  This construction is generally considered formal, lending itself better to written language or more serious spoken contexts. While used by both men and women, the formality of the construction makes it less common in casual conversation.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of てならない lies in the combination of the て-form, a versatile grammatical form expressing various nuances depending on the context, and the negative form of なる (naru).  The verb なる itself signifies a change of state or becoming.  By negating it, the construction emphasizes the persistence of the state described by the preceding て-form, reinforcing the idea of an inescapable or overwhelming feeling.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these expressions share similarities in conveying intensity, their subtle differences in nuance are vital.  Pay close attention to whether you're describing an unavoidable action (ざるを得ない, ないわけにはいかない), an intense desire (てたまらない), a resigned acceptance (てしょうがない), a specific degree (ことに), or an irresistible impulse (ずにはいられない, Adj限りだ).  Understanding these distinctions will help you choose the most precise and natural expression for your intended meaning."
