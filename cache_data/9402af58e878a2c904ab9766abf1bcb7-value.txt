    "writeup": "**好き (suki)**, meaning \"to like,\" is a common *na*-adjective. *Na*-adjectives function as both adjectives and nouns, changing form depending on their role in the sentence. When acting as an adjective, **好き** is followed by **な**. When acting as a noun, it is followed by **だ** (casual) or **です** (polite). In statements using **だ** or **です**, **好き** asserts something is "likable." When modified by **な**, it expresses "likability" as a quality of a noun.

    Important considerations:
    *   Expressing **好き** towards a person can imply romantic interest.
    *   **大好き (daisuki)** is often translated as \"love.\"",
    "etymology": "The origin of 好き (suki) is debated, but it may be related to the verb 好く (suku), meaning 'to prefer' or 'to be fond of.' Over time, it evolved into an adjective expressing a state of liking.",
