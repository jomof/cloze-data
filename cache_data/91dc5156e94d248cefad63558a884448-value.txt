  "writeup": "The common Japanese structure という has a fascinating nuance when used with repeated nouns.  It signifies 'every single (A),' where (A) is the noun repeated. While often used for emphasis, the literal meaning is closer to 'every (B) that could be called an (A).'  The という sits between the identical nouns.  Important Considerations: When encountering this structure with abstract concepts like 今日 'today,' the meaning shifts to '(A) of all (A)s,' implying a particular significance for that instance. This special aspect is usually explained in the following clause.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of という is quite complex, involving the evolution of the verb言う (iu) meaning 'to say'.  Over time, it developed into various usages, including this emphatic construction expressing totality.  The repetition of the noun intensifies the meaning, highlighting each individual instance within a set.",
