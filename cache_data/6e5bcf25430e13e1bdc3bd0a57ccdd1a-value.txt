  "writeup": "The grammar point \"いかん〜ず\" (ikan~zu) translates to \"regardless of\" or \"irrespective of.\"  It's a formal, written expression used to indicate that something will happen regardless of a preceding condition.  The structure is always [Noun]のいかんに関わらず, によらず, or を問わず, followed by the main clause.  Note that いかん itself means 'how' or 'in what way,' but in this construction, it functions as a way to introduce the condition that is being disregarded.  Mastering this construction adds a sophisticated touch to your written Japanese, conveying a sense of formality and unwavering determination.  It's important to understand that this construction is largely confined to formal writing and wouldn't be appropriate for casual conversation.",
  "etymology": "This construction combines いかん (ikan), meaning 'how' or 'in what way,' with the negative auxiliary verb ず (zu).  The ず (zu) negates the following verb, creating a sense of indifference to the preceding condition. The use of いかん here shifts its meaning from a question of 'how' to a broader sense of 'whatever way' or 'whatever the case may be'. The three common verbs used with this construction each have nuanced meanings. 関わらず (kanawarazu) emphasizes lack of relation, によらず (niyorazu) stresses independence, and を問わず (wo towaz) suggests disregarding any question about the condition.",
