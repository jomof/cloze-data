  "writeup": "並み is a noun meaning \"average,\" \"ordinary,\" or \"standard.\"  It's derived from the classical verb 並む (namumu), meaning \"to line up.\"  Unlike the more common 並ぶ (narabu), 並む is rarely used in modern Japanese.  When used after a noun, 並み indicates that something is comparable to a standard or norm. You can often interpret it as \"on par with (A),\" \"worthy of (A),\" or \"as standard for (A).\"  The literal translation of \"in line with (A)\" is suitable in many contexts. \n\n**Important Considerations:** While 並み can sometimes function as a suffix implying \"as standard for (A),\" the meaning of \"average\" or \"ordinary\" is usually reserved for when 並み stands alone as a noun. In such cases, it's often written as 並 (nami) and followed by the particle の (no), specifying the average. For example, 並の (nami no) means \"average.\"  \n\nIt's crucial to use 並み only in situations where (A) has a widely recognized or easily identifiable standard or norm. Avoid using it if the \"norm\" depends on subjective opinion rather than an objective standard.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the effectiveness of 並み depends heavily on the context. Ensure that the standard you're comparing to is well-established and easily understood by your listener.",
  "etymology": "The word 並み (nami) is derived from the archaic verb 並む (namumu), meaning \"to line up.\"  The modern equivalent is 並ぶ (narabu). The use of 並み as a suffix to denote comparability reflects its root meaning:  placing something \"in line with\" a recognized standard."
