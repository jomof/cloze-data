    "etymology": "あそこ is derived from the archaic demonstrative pronoun あ , combined with the locative suffix こ.  Originally, あ pointed to something distant.  The suffix こ specifies location, similar to how it functions in ここ (here) and そこ (there).",
    "writeup": "あそこ is a demonstrative pronoun, used to indicate a place distant from both the speaker and the listener.  Think of it as indicating \"that place over there.\"  It corresponds to the English \"over there.\"  Similar to ここ (here) and そこ (there), it identifies a location.  You can use あそこ for physical locations, of course. But also, consider using it for more abstract concepts, like a previous topic of conversation, assuming both parties understand the reference intimately.  Be careful not to confuse あそこ with あっち. While both can translate to \"over there,\" あっち emphasizes direction, whereas あそこ strictly refers to \"that place.\"",
