    "writeup": "The grammar point **もらう (morau)** is used to express that someone does something for the speaker's benefit. It's attached to the te-form of a verb (Vて + もらう). This grammar point implies that the speaker is receiving a favor or a benefit from someone else's action. It is important to remember that the person doing the action is typically of equal or lower status than the person who benefits. The counterpart to もらう is くれる (kureru), which indicates that the speaker does something for someone else.",
