  "writeup": "The grammar point \"んだけど/んですが\" is a versatile expression combining the explanatory/causal んだ with the adversative けど.  It translates as 'but...', but carries a nuance closer to 'but with (A) as the reason... (B)', where (B) is often implied. This leaves room for an implicit reply, creating a conversational opening. Several interchangeable forms exist, ranging from casual to formal: んだけど, んだけれど, んだけれども, んだが, んですが. Replacing ん with の adds a touch of formality to any of these.  んだが, or simply だが, is the strongest form, leaning quite masculine. Use it with a softer tone to avoid sounding overly authoritative.  While ん (or の) can be omitted, it's less common in modern Japanese.  This construction naturally creates a sense of conversational flow and hesitancy, making it great for softening potentially blunt statements.",
  "etymology": "This grammar point is a combination of the sentence-ending particle んだ (nda), expressing a reason or explanation, and the conjunction particle けど (kedo), indicating contrast or a turning point in thought.  The ん (n) sound is a shortened form of the particle の (no), adding a nuance of formality.  The combination creates a unique conversational style, adding a subtle layer of nuance absent in a simple 'but'.",
