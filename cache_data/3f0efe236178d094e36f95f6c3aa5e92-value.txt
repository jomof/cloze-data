  "writeup": "The adverbial phrase 必ずしも (kanarazushimo) means \"not always,\" \"not necessarily,\" or \"not entirely.\"  It's a nuanced expression crucial for conveying subtleties in Japanese.  While seemingly simple, understanding its construction unlocks a deeper appreciation for the language.  It combines 必ず (kanarazu, 'certainly' or 'invariably') with the particles し (shi) and も (mo).  The しも combination intensifies the preceding word, creating a sense of absolute certainty. However, the crucial point is that 必ずしも is exclusively used in negative contexts, hence its translation as 'not always,' etc.  This seemingly contradictory nature—an expression of absolute certainty used only to negate—highlights a beautiful complexity of Japanese grammar.  Often placed at the beginning of a clause, it elegantly qualifies a statement, implying an exception or a lack of complete assurance. Mastering 必ずしも allows for greater precision and a more refined expression of doubt or qualification.",
  "etymology": "The phrase 必ずしも derives from the combination of 必ず (kanarazu, certainly), し (shi, an intensifying particle often used in conjunction with も), and も (mo, also an intensifying/inclusive particle). The しも combination works to emphasize the preceding word, adding weight to the meaning and often translating as 'absolutely certainly' in a positive context. However, the inclusion of 必ずしも in negative sentences creates the unique nuance of 'not necessarily' or 'not always'. This demonstrates the complex interplay of particles and adverbs in generating a wide range of nuanced meanings in the Japanese language.",

      "register": "standard",

      "japanese": "女の人は**必ずしも**料理が好きとは限らない。",
      "english": "Women aren't necessarily fond of cooking.",
      "register": "standard",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 必ずしも, とは限らない, and というものでもない share overlapping meanings, subtle differences exist in their usage.  必ずしも emphasizes a degree of certain expectation being unrealized; とは限らない suggests a lack of absolute certainty; and というものでもない implies that a situation isn't solely defined by a single characteristic. Choose carefully based on the context and the level of certainty you wish to convey.  Paying attention to the subtle shades of meaning in these phrases is crucial to achieving natural and fluent Japanese.  The key difference between 必ずしも and the other phrases is that it is only used with negative sentences."
