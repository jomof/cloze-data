  "writeup": "The word まだ, meaning \"still\" or \"not yet,\" is a fundamental adverbial particle in Japanese. Its versatility stems from its core meaning: \"something is unexpectedly still going.\"  This single word elegantly covers both 'still' and 'not yet,' depending on the context – a positive or negative sentence.  When used with a positive verb, it conveys 'still'; with a negative verb, it expresses 'not yet.' For instance, \"ケーキがまだあります\" (There is still cake) is positive, and \"まだ食べていません\" (I haven't eaten yet) is negative.  The nuance shifts subtly based on whether the action is ongoing (using ている) or completed.  We'll explore the nuances of the negative form in more detail when we discuss まだ～ていません.  Interestingly, まだ is often doubled (まだまだ) for emphasis, implying a significant lack or delay.  It's a common, versatile word, foundational to everyday speech.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of まだ is complex and not definitively settled. However, some etymological theories posit that it is related to words suggesting continuity or a state of being unfinished.",
