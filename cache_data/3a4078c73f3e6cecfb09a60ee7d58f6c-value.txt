    "writeup": "では, それでは, and じゃあ are conjunctions used to transition between topics, indicate a result or conclusion, or politely end a conversation.  では and じゃあ are both shortened forms of それでは.  It can be used to continue on the same topic showing that \"(B) is a result of (A)\", or to change the conversation topic completely, showing that \"(A) is at a good point to become (B).\" Common English translations include \"if so,\" \"well then,\" and \"in that case.\"  These expressions are also frequently used as a polite way to say \"goodbye,\" similar to \"well... I best be off\" in English.",
