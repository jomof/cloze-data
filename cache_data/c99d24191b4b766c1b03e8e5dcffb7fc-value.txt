    "writeup": "「ふうに」 is a suffix in Japanese, often written in kana, that indicates something is in the style, manner, or method of what comes before it. It functions similarly to a な-adjective.  When used adverbially to describe how something is done, it is followed by 「に」. You'll often see 「ふうに」 used after pre-noun adjectival words such as 「こんな」, 「そんな」, and 「あんな」, to express doing something \"like this,\" \"like that,\" etc.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「ふう」 comes from the kanji 「風」 (wind). While you can think of it as having an \"air of\" something for memorization, remember that the meanings aren't perfectly equivalent.\n*   「ふうに」 describes an apparent manner or style; it doesn't necessarily reflect the reality of the situation.",
