  "writeup": "なり is a fascinating particle, a bit old-fashioned, but brimming with nuance.  It signifies the immediate consequence of an action, translating to 'as soon as (A), (B)' or 'the moment (A), (B)'. This construction typically follows the dictionary form of verbs and acts as a conjunction particle. Importantly, (B) usually describes a surprising or impactful event often stemming from strong emotion or volition.  It's also noteworthy that なり is almost exclusively used when describing the actions of others, rarely oneself.  A fun fact:  Despite its superficial resemblance to a conjugation of the u-verb なる (naru, 'to become'), なり actually derives from one of the readings of 形 (katachi, 'shape'), alluding to the resultant state of (A) in a manner similar to ところ (tokoro).",
  "etymology": "The particle なり originates from one of the readings of the kanji 形 (katachi), meaning \"shape\" or \"form.\"  In this grammatical context, it doesn't refer to a physical shape, but rather to the \"form\" or \"state\" that results immediately after the preceding action.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "息子が家に**上がるなり**トイレへと駆け込んだ。",
      "english": "My son ran to the toilet as soon as he entered the house.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a relatively neutral register, suitable for everyday conversation. The description of the son's immediate action after entering the house highlights the particle なり's function. There's nothing particularly gendered or age-specific about this sentence, although a mother describing her son is implied."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ママ友が私の家へ**入るなり**、冷蔵庫の中を物色し始めた。",
      "english": "As soon as my mom-friend entered my house, she started to go through my refrigerator.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "storytelling",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register is evident through the use of ママ友 (mama-tomo, 'mom-friend'), a colloquial term.  The description implies a slightly critical or humorous tone; the action of snooping suggests a potentially negative judgment of the mom-friend's behavior. This could be said between friends or family members and is not particularly gender-specific. The setting is storytelling; this is not a sentence that would happen in a formal setting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼が机に**座るなり**すぐスマホをいじり始めたから注意した。",
      "english": "I warned him because he started playing on his phone as soon as he sat down.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register is shown in the use of the plain form of the verb 注意した (chūi shita, 'warned').  The sentence describes a reaction to someone's behavior—the speaker's disapproval is clear. This sentence could be spoken by an older person about a younger person; there's nothing particularly gendered about this sentence. The setting is more casual."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "踊りを**止めるなり**、彼女が急にキスしてくれたんだ。気持ちいい。",
      "english": "The moment I stopped dancing, she suddenly kissed me.  It felt great.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The casual register is demonstrated through the plain form of the verb 止める (tomeru, 'to stop'). The sentence contains a flirty innuendo, suitable for close relationships.  The use of 「彼女が急にキスしてくれたんだ」 (kanojo ga kyū ni kisu shite kureta nda, 'she suddenly kissed me') is fairly gender-specific; it's a man speaking to a man, about a woman. The setting is explicitly flirty."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "父が出張から**帰るなり**母は泣きだした。",
      "english": "The moment my father returned from his business trip, my mother started crying.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "storytelling",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The semi-formal register shows a clear and neutral tone used to convey information. The sentence describes an event with some emotional weight—the suddenness of the mother's crying is emphasized using なり (nari). There is nothing particularly gendered or age-specific about this sentence."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "故郷に**帰るなり**灰燼に帰した家を見て、驚き、悲しんだ。",
      "english": "As soon as I returned to my hometown, I saw my house reduced to ashes, and I was shocked and saddened.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal register is appropriate given the serious and reflective nature of the situation described. The sentence structure emphasizes the immediate impact of seeing the destroyed home; the use of 「灰燼に帰した家」 (kaijin ni kaishita ie, 'house reduced to ashes') adds gravity. This would be suitable in any gender-neutral setting or personal narrative."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how なり emphasizes the immediacy and unexpectedness of the second action.  It's a powerful way to portray a sudden shift or consequence.",

    {
      "term": "と同時に",
      "meaning": "At the same time as, The instant, The moment, As well as",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike なり, と同時に (to douji ni) emphasizes simultaneity rather than immediate consequence.  It suggests two actions happening concurrently, not one immediately following the other."
    },
    {
      "term": "たとたんに",
      "meaning": "The instant or moment, As soon as, Just as",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While similar in meaning to なり, たとたんに (tato tan ni) is more commonly used in spoken Japanese and often carries a slightly more sudden or abrupt connotation."
    },
    {
      "term": "次第",
      "meaning": "As soon as",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "次第 (shidai) is more formal and often used in written Japanese.  It implies a more direct causal relationship than なり. "
    },
    {
      "term": "かと思ったら・かと思うと",
      "meaning": "Then again, Just when I thought, No sooner than",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "かと思ったら・かと思うと (ka to omottara/ka to omou to) highlights a contrast or unexpected turn of events.  It suggests a prior expectation that was quickly contradicted."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the subtle differences in emphasis.  なり focuses on the immediate consequence; と同時に emphasizes simultaneity; たとたんに suggests a more abrupt change; 次第 is more formal; and かと思ったら/かと思うと emphasizes a contrast or unexpected twist.  Choose the particle that best reflects the specific nuance you wish to convey."
