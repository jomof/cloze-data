    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from combining 「に」 (particle), 「限る」 (kagiru - to limit), and 「ず」 (zu - archaic negative auxiliary verb, similar to ない). Essentially, it means 'not limiting to' something.",
    "writeup": "「に限らず」is a Japanese sentence pattern used to express that something is 'not just (A), but (B) too', or 'not only (A), but also (B)'. It combines 「に」, the verb 「限る」 (to limit), and the literary auxiliary verb 「ず」, which functions similarly to 「ない」. This structure appears after nouns, with the (B) part of the sentence expanding on things included in the same scope or category as (A). Sometimes, 「も」is added for emphasis in the (B) part, especially when indicating multiple additions, like '(B)も (C)も'. This grammar point is more formal than 「だけでなく」.",
