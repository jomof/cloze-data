  "writeup": "The phrase ～というのは事実だ emphatically asserts the truth or undeniable nature of a statement.  It's a powerful way to state something as an irrefutable fact.  The structure hinges on というのは, which nominalizes the preceding clause, effectively saying 'the fact that…'.  This nominalized clause is then followed by 事実だ ('is a fact'), or です in polite contexts.  While という can sometimes be omitted, resulting in a slightly less forceful assertion, its inclusion strengthens the statement.  The versatility of というのは allows for its use with a wide range of preceding phrases.  This construction is suitable for most formal and informal situations, although the level of formality depends largely on the choice of だ vs. です.",
  "etymology": "The phrase combines two core elements:  という (which indicates quoting or describing something) and 事実 (fact, truth).  The use of 事実 is straightforward, directly conveying the concept of a proven reality.  The nominalizing function of というのは, derived from the combination of と言う and の, enables the speaker to present a proposition as a concrete fact.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the strength of the assertion depends not only on the structure itself but also on the context and the speaker's tone.
