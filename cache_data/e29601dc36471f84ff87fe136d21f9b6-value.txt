  "writeup": "The word 即ち (すなわち, sunawachi) is a versatile Japanese term often translated as \"in other words,\" \"that is,\" or \"namely.\"  While grammatically an adverb, it functions more like a conjunction, smoothly connecting two sentences through a logical explanation or clarification.  It subtly emphasizes agreement or correspondence between the ideas presented in the linked sentences, creating a sense of equivalence. This differs slightly from つまり (tsumari), which focuses solely on summarization, rather than this implied agreement.",
  "etymology": "The kanji 即ち (sunawachi) literally means 'in accordance with' or 'immediately'.  The 'immediate' aspect is less relevant in modern usage; the core meaning revolves around the correspondence between two clauses. This etymology gives a subtle nuance of agreement or confirmation, unlike the more neutral 'summarization' conveyed by つまり.",
