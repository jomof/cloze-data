    "writeup": "Similar to 必要, **必要がある** is used to emphasize the **need** or **necessity** of something. The key difference is that **必要がある** specifically highlights the necessity to **do** something. Therefore, it's used with verbs without needing to nominalize them.  To use **必要がある**, simply attach it to the plain form of the verb indicating what needs to be done. \n\nStructurally, this grammar pattern combines a verb with 必要 (creating a noun modified by the verb), the case-marking particle が, and the u-verb ある.  Essentially, it means \"the need for doing (A) exists.\" \n\nThis pattern can also be used in the negative form to indicate that there is **no need to do (A)** or that **doing (A) is not necessary**.",
