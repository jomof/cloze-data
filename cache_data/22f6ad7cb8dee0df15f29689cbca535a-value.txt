    "etymology": "The particle も indicates \"also\" or \"too.\" 又 (mata) means \"again\" or \"moreover.\" Together, they create a stronger emphasis than も alone, highlighting that something is not only true, but also reinforces a prior point or introduces a new, related one.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「も又」 functions as an adverbial phrase, typically written in hiragana, that means \"also,\" \"too,\" \"again,\" or even \"even\" depending on the context. It's a stronger, more emphatic version of 「も」. It appears after nouns or noun-like phrases, emphasizing that the connected noun is a primary point to consider, regardless of any contrasting opinion presented in the sentence. 「も又」 often appears in formal writing or speech.",
