    "etymology": "The suffix 「み」 is related to the noun 「実(み)」 (mi), meaning \"fruit\" or \"substance,\" suggesting it captures the essence or inherent quality of something.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「み」 is used to transform adjectives into nouns, often indicating a state, condition, or quality. It attaches to the stem of both い-adjectives (by removing the い) and な-adjectives (by removing the な). While often translated as \"~ness\" in English, it's **important** to understand its specific nuance.\n\n「み」 emphasizes the inherent **condition** or **nature** of something rather than a measurable degree. It describes a quality that exists in a constant state. Therefore, it's not typically used to express varying levels of a characteristic, but rather the inherent presence of that characteristic.\n\nAdditionally, 「み」 can sometimes function as a direct substitute for the kanji 「味 (あじ)」 (aji), meaning \"taste.\" In these cases, it describes a sensory quality, such as the taste or color of something.",
