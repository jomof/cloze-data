    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とは言うものの」 is derived from 「と」 (a particle indicating content), 「は」 (a topic marker), 「言う」 (the verb 'to say'), and 「ものの」 (a conjunction indicating concession, similar to 'although'). So, it literally translates to \"although it is said that...\"",
    "writeup": "「とは言うものの」 is a set expression used to introduce a contrast between a statement or common belief (A) and a differing reality or opinion (B). It's similar to \"although\" or \"but\" in English. When used after nouns or な-adjectives, 「だ」 typically precedes 「とは言うものの」. The phrase can also start a sentence, acknowledging a previous statement while introducing further important details. The (B) portion after 「ものの」 is usually the more important or defining point.",
