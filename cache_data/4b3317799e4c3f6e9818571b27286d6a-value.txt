  "writeup": "The particle から (kara) is a fundamental aspect of Japanese grammar, primarily functioning as a case marking particle indicating reason or cause.  While often translated simply as \"because\" or \"since,\" its nuanced usage requires careful consideration.  Think of から as fundamentally meaning 'from,' deriving its causal meaning from indicating the origin of an action or state.  Therefore, \"From (reason A), (result B)\" translates to \"Because of A, B.\"  When used with nouns or na-adjectives, the copula だ (da) is necessary to connect the reason to the resulting clause.  Mastering から will significantly enhance your ability to express causality in Japanese.  This simple particle, though seemingly straightforward, reveals the elegance of Japanese sentence structure.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of から (kara) traces back to the classical Japanese word '乎ら' (kara), an adverbial particle indicating origin or source. Over time, it evolved into its modern form, maintaining its core sense of 'from,' which underlies its various grammatical functions, including its prevalent use to denote reason or cause.",
