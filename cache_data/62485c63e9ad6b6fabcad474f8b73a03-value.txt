    "writeup": "「ところを見ると」 is a set phrase in Japanese used to express a subjective judgment or inference based on an observed situation or evidence.  It literally means something like \"looking at the state/aspect of,\" implying that the speaker is forming an opinion **based on what they see or perceive**. The part before 「ところを見ると」 usually describes an observable action or situation. The part after it presents the speaker's deduction or conclusion.  Because it's based on observation and deduction, the concluding part often includes expressions of probability or uncertainty like 「だろう」, 「かもしれない」, 「でしょう」, or 「ね」.",

To avoid confusion, focus on whether your judgment is based on a specific, visual observation (ところを見ると) versus a more general assessment (からすると/すれば) or a key, obvious point (からして)."
