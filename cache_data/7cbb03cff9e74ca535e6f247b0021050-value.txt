  "writeup": "The particle より, meaning \"than,\" is a crucial element for making comparisons in Japanese.  While often introduced alongside より～のほうが (more X than Y), understanding its independent usage is key to fluent communication.  Used alone, より indicates that the preceding noun or verb represents the *lesser* quantity or quality in a comparison. The focus, however, shifts to the element following より (often marked by が), emphasizing what is *greater*.  For instance,  \"A より B が大きい\" means \"B is bigger than A.\"  The nuance is subtle, yet mastering this aspect enhances your ability to express comparative statements naturally.  Note that this is different from its use in より～のほうが which is more overtly comparative, and often sounds slightly more formal or polite than simply using より in itself. Importantly, the context of the sentences determines if this is a comparison against a specific item or a broad range of other things, making it crucial to consider the overall context of your communications.",

      "english": "Apples are smaller than bananas.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a simple comparative sentence. The structure follows the standard pattern: [A] より [B] が [adjective].  The politeness comes from the use of です."

    {
      "japanese": "今日のテストは昨日のテストより簡単だった。",
      "english": "Today's test was easier than yesterday's test.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the past tense, demonstrating a comparison in the past. The casual register is evident in the omission of です。"

    {
      "japanese": "彼女より、あの人の方が魅力的だ。",
      "english": "That person is more charming than her.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The casual register and the use of the phrase 「あの人」 adds a certain ambiguity that's appropriate for flirting; the sentence's directness conveys interest. The speaker is comparing the listener's charm to that of another person. Note that it's implied the speaker is comparing the listener to the 'other person', and implying he finds the listener more attractive."

      "japanese": "コーヒーより紅茶の方が好きだよ。",
      "english": "I like tea more than coffee.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the common phrase より～の方が to make the comparison more explicit. The よ in だよ is a casual sentence ending. Note that the speaker is not directly comparing coffee and tea, but is simply stating their preference for tea in relation to coffee."

    {
      "japanese": "この映画は、私が今まで見た映画よりずっと面白かった。",
      "english": "This movie was much more interesting than any movie I've ever seen.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence demonstrates a comparison where the subject is compared to a broader range of options. The use of 「今まで」 and 「ずっと」 intensifies the comparison."

      "japanese": "彼と話すより、本を読む方が静かで落ち着ける。",
      "english": "Reading books is calmer and more relaxing than talking to him.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence compares two actions. The semi-formal register is achieved through the sentence structure and the avoidance of overly casual sentence endings."

      "japanese": "あのレストランは、値段より味が重要だ。",
      "english": "In that restaurant, taste is more important than price.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the core function of より is to establish the lesser element in a comparison. The following phrase, often marked by が, then highlights the superior aspect.  Context is vital, especially when より is not directly attached to a word,  allowing for flexible and nuanced comparative expressions.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these particles share similarities with より in expressing comparisons or degrees, their usage and resulting nuances differ. Pay close attention to the specific context and the desired emphasis to select the most appropriate particle.  Consider whether you are comparing directly, expressing a degree of difference, or conveying a more nuanced or emphatic comparison."
