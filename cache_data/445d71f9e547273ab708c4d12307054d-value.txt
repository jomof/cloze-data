    "writeup": "「場合は」 is a Japanese phrase that translates to \"in the event of (A)\" or \"in the case of (A)\".  Think of it as setting up a hypothetical situation or considering a particular circumstance.  It's quite versatile and can follow various parts of speech:\n\n*   **Nouns:** Use 「名詞 + の + 場合は」 (e.g., 「雨の場合」 - in the case of rain)\n*   **な-Adjectives:** Use 「な-形容詞 + な + 場合は」 (e.g., 「便利な場合は」 - in the case that it's convenient)\n*   **Verbs/い-Adjectives:** Use the plain form directly before 「場合は」 (e.g., 「行く場合は」 - in the event of going; 「暑い場合は」 - in the case that it's hot)\n\nThe word 「場合 (ばあい)」 itself means \"case\" or \"situation\". When you add the 「は」 particle, it often carries a **contrastive nuance**. This means you're often comparing this specific \"case\" or \"situation\" to something else, either implicitly or explicitly.\n\n**Important Consideration:** While 「場合は」 is used for hypothetical situations, it implies a degree of **randomness or unpredictability**.  Therefore, it's generally not used for events that happen regularly or are planned and controlled. For those situations, 「時は (ときは)」 is more appropriate.",
    "etymology": "The term 「場合 (ばあい)」 is composed of two kanji: 「場 (ba)」 meaning \"place\" or \"situation,\" and 「合 (ai)」 meaning \"to fit,\" \"to suit,\" or \"to match.\"  Therefore, 「場合」 literally suggests a \"situation that fits\" or a \"fitting circumstance.\"",
