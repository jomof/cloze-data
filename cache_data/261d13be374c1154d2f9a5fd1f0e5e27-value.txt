  "writeup": "にも程がある is an expression used critically to indicate something is excessive, based on the speaker's judgment.  Common translations include \"How (A) can one be!\", \"There is a limit to (A)\", or \"You are too (A)!\".  Literally, it means \"There are even limits within (A)\", highlighting the exceeding nature of the described action or state. This structure can follow various word types in their standard forms.  While predominantly used negatively,  it can be employed ironically or humorously with positive adjectives like かわいい ('cute') or うまい ('delicious') to express strong admiration.",
  "etymology": "The phrase is built from に (case particle), も (adverbial particle), 程 ('bounds' or 'extent'), and がある ('to have' or 'to exist').  The combination of these words creates a nuanced expression implying an exceeding of acceptable boundaries.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses \"よ\" which softens the criticism slightly, making it suitable for a friendly setting.  The phrase 「飲み過ぎ」 is a common expression easily understood."

      "japanese": "図々しい**にも程がある**ね。",
      "english": "That's incredibly cheeky!",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of \"ね\" makes it slightly softer and more conversational than a blunt statement but maintains a serious tone through the criticism of the action."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "失礼**にも程がある**！",
      "english": "That's beyond rude!",
      "register": "casual",

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The exclamation mark shows the speaker's strong negative emotion. This is a very common and versatile expression to express annoyance."

      "english": "That's not funny at all!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Using \"よ\" softens the statement, allowing it to be used humorously to respond to an inappropriate joke."

      "english": "She's unbelievably cute!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the term \"かわいい\", a typical adjective used by both genders when showing their admiration for the cuteness of a girl.  The  \"ね\" creates a gentler, more flirtatious tone rather than an outright exclamation."

    {
      "japanese": "あのね、私と付き合う**にも程がある**と思わない？",

      "nuance": "This is a flirtatious use, employing self-deprecation to attract the listener. The phrase 「あのね」is a common way for girls to start a conversation in a slightly playful manner. The question uses 「私と付き合う」 in this context, where the listener is being hinted towards."

      "english": "His arrogance is unbearable.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence is a straightforward statement. The absence of any softening particles like \"よ\" or \"ね\" makes this sentence more serious and direct. 「傲慢さ」 is a relatively formal word choice."

  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the intensity of the expression can be adjusted by the choice of sentence-final particles and the overall context. Remember that while mostly used negatively, the playful use, particularly with positive adjectives, adds a layer of complexity to its usage.",
