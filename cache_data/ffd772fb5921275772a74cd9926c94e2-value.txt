    "etymology": "結構 (けっこう) is formed from the kanji 結 (ketsu) meaning \"to tie, bind, or conclude\" and 構 (kō) meaning \"structure, framework, or composition.\" Together, they suggest something well-structured or complete, which lends itself to the meanings of \"quite\" or \"sufficient.\"",
    "writeup": "**Kekkou (結構)** is often used as an adverb meaning \"quite,\" \"fairly,\" or \"rather.\" However, it is also frequently used as a set phrase to politely decline something, similar to saying \"no thank you\" or \"I'm fine\" in English. It can act as a な-adjective, but is more frequently used as an adverb modifying an entire sentence. When declining, it is often used with です (kekkou desu).",
