    "etymology": "The origin of 「らしい」is debated, but one prominent theory suggests it derives from the verb 「良し (yoshi)」, meaning \"good\" or \"fine\". Over time, it evolved to express a sense of something being \"likely good\" or \"appearing to be good,\" eventually morphing into the modern meaning of \"it seems\" or \"apparently\".",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb 「らしい」 is similar to 「そうだ」 and 「ようだ」 in expressing something the speaker *thinks* is true, known as 推定 (presumption). However, 「らしい」 often conveys a relatively confident presumption. It's commonly translated as \"it seems like (A)\" or \"I heard that (A)\".\n\nTo use 「らしい」, attach it to the end of any (non-polite) verb, adjective, or noun. It indicates the speaker has some reason to believe that (A) is true—they might have heard, seen, or read something—but aren't 100% certain.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   There are two main forms of 「らしい」: the auxiliary verb usage and the auxiliary adjective usage. The auxiliary adjective usage, meaning \"typical of (A),\" will be covered in a separate lesson.",
