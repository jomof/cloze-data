  "writeup": "The adverbial particle も (mo) is fascinating.  When used after a specific number plus a counter, it highlights the unexpectedness of that quantity.  This isn't simply stating a fact; it emphasizes the surprising or significant nature of the number.  Therefore, も can translate as 'as much as,' 'as many as,' or 'not even,' depending on context.  This usage differs from も's more common meaning of 'too' or 'also.' In those cases, も still points to something unexpected or added to a previously established set, but here, the emphasis is squarely on the numerical quantity itself. The key is understanding the implied surprise or contrast.  Is the number unexpectedly large?  Unexpectedly small? That's what も accentuates.",

    {
      "japanese": "１時間も待ったのに、彼は来なかった。(ichi-jikan mo mattanoni, kare wa konakatta)",
      "english": "I waited for a whole hour, but he didn't come.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「１時間も」 to emphasize the unexpectedly long wait.  The use of のに (noni) further enhances the feeling of disappointment. The casual register is apparent in the sentence structure and the lack of polite verb endings."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "たった３００円もあれば、十分だ。(Tatta 300-en mo areba, juubun da)",
      "english": "Just 300 yen is enough.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "「たった３００円も」 highlights the surprisingly small amount needed, implying a pleasant surprise. The casual tone stems from the sentence's concise nature and the plain form of the verb ある (aru)."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼女と２回も会ったよ。(kanojo to ni-kai mo atta yo)",
      "english": "I've met her twice already!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The speaker uses 「２回も」 to emphasize the number of times he's met the woman, perhaps implying a closer-than-expected relationship.  The use of よ (yo) adds a conversational and slightly boastful tone.  This type of casual and slightly boastful phrasing is more often employed by men."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "５０００円も使ったのか！(go-sen-en mo tsukatta no ka!)",
      "english": "You spent 5,000 yen?!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "interrogative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「５０００円も」 to express surprise at the unexpectedly large amount spent.  The use of か (ka) turns it into an exclamation. The casual register is evident in the sentence's directness and the omission of polite forms."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あのレストラン、１万円もするんです。(Ano resutoran, ichiman-en mo surun desu)",
      "english": "That restaurant costs as much as 10,000 yen!",
      "register": "teineigo",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite form 「～んです」 (n desu) adds a respectful and indirect tone suitable for a semi-formal context.  The use of 「１万円も」 expresses surprise at the high price, while still remaining polite.  This is useful when speaking to someone you respect, or in a more formal environment."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼から、花束を一つも貰ってない。(Kare kara, hanataba o hitotsu mo motte inai)",
      "english": "I haven't received a single bouquet from him.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "melancholic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "「一つも」 emphasizes the complete lack of bouquets, highlighting the speaker's disappointment. The semi-formal register is achieved through the use of standard grammatical structure without overtly casual or polite elements."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "私だって、あなたに会いたくて、何度も電話をしたのよ。(Watashi datte, anata ni aitakute, nando mo denwa o shita no yo)",

      "listener_gender": "male",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "listener_age": "older",
      "nuance": "The phrase 「何度も」 emphasizes the repeated attempts to contact the listener. The use of だって (datte) adds an emotional element, indicating that the speaker's feelings should be understood.  The use of のよ (no yo) is a characteristically feminine speech ending often used among women of younger generations, adding a softer touch to the slightly pleading tone. The intimate register comes from the frank and emotionally charged language."

  ],
  "etymology": "The particle も (mo) has a long and complex history, evolving from earlier forms indicating emphasis and totality. Its current usage reflects a gradual shift in emphasis, moving from simply 'also' or 'too' to highlighting the unexpected or noteworthy nature of a quantified element."
