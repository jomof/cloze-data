        "Register": "Varies depending on the verb and context.",
        "Function": "Indicates the place where movement occurs.",

    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「を」 originally indicated the object of a verb, but in this case, it evolved to also denote the space through which movement occurs, linking the action to the area it traverses.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「を」 marks the space through which movement occurs. It's used with verbs of motion like 「歩く」(to walk), 「飛ぶ」(to fly), 「走る」(to run), and 「曲がる」(to turn). Think of it as indicating the 'route' or 'area' where the action takes place. Unlike 「で」, which indicates the *location* of an action, 「を」 emphasizes the *movement* through a space.",
