    "etymology": "The grammar point 「そうになる」 combines 「そう」 (sou), meaning 'it seems like' or 'appearing to be,' with 「になる」 (ni naru), meaning 'to become.' Therefore, it literally translates to 'it becomes like that,' implying that something is on the verge of happening or nearly becomes a reality.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「そうになる」 expresses that something almost happened but did not. It conveys a sense of near occurrence, where an event or state was on the verge of becoming a reality. It is formed by attaching 「そうになる」 to the ます-stem of a verb, for example, 「食べそうになる」(tabe sou ni naru) meaning 'almost eat'. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The focus is on the potential event and the narrow escape from it.\n*   It is often used to express relief or concern regarding the almost-occurred event.\n*   It's commonly used in storytelling to create suspense or emphasize the near miss.",

            "etymology": "「そう」 means 'looks like'. 「に」 means 'to become'. 「なった」 means 'became'. So putting it all together, it means 'it became so that [I would eat it all]'."
