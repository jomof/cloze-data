  "writeup": "これ, pronounced \"kore,\" translates to \"this.\"  It's a demonstrative pronoun, but functionally acts more like a substitute noun.  Its use highlights something near the speaker, either physically or emotionally.  Understanding its function as a substitute noun simplifies its usage.  It replaces a noun whose specific name isn't crucial or is unknown to the speaker.  The choice between これ and other demonstrative pronouns (this, that, those) hinges on proximity and the speaker's perspective.",
