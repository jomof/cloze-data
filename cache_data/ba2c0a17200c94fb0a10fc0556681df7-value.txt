  "writeup": "によって (ni yotte), による (ni yoru), and により (ni yori) are nuanced variations expressing 'by means of,' 'according to,' 'depending on,' 'because of,' or 'due to.'  They share the root verb よる (yoru), meaning 'to depend on' or 'to be caused by.'  The key difference lies in their grammatical function and typical sentence placement. によって, typically preceding a comma, separates the cause (A) from the effect (B). による usually concludes a sentence, emphasizing the dependence on (A). により, similar to によって, often appears before a comma, also separating (A) and (B).  The choice depends on stylistic preference and desired emphasis.  While often used interchangeably, subtle differences exist.  Note that による can sometimes function differently, modifying a preceding noun to highlight causation. For example, 'human error' as a cause, or 'robber' as a cause. This particular usage isn't covered in this grammar point.  It's a fascinating nuance that demonstrates the depth of the Japanese language. Attach these constructions to the noun representing the cause or dependency.",

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「と思うよ (to omou yo)」, a softer, more tentative expression often associated with female speech.  The choice of 「による (ni yoru)」 emphasizes the uncertainty based on individual personality."

      "conjugation": "て-form",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「よ (yo)」, a sentence-final particle that adds a casual and intimate tone.  The phrasing, 「君の笑顔によって (kimi no egao ni yotte),」 directly relates the speaker's emotional response to the listener's actions, creating a more personal and flirtatious nuance.  The choice of 「によって (ni yotte)」 places emphasis on the listener's smile as the direct cause of the speaker's feeling."

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「〜ものです (…mono desu)」, a formal expression often used in polite speech. The speaker directly connects their feelings with their love for the listener.  The use of 「による (ni yoru)」 makes it very clear that these are causally linked. The listener is the cause of the speaker's feelings."

  "etymology": "The grammar point is built around the verb よる (yoru), which has roots in ancient Japanese verbs related to leaning, depending, or relying upon something.  Its evolution reflects the grammaticalization process where a verb's meaning shifts to express a grammatical function.  The addition of the particle に (ni) further solidifies its role in indicating the source or cause.",

      "term": "ために",

      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike によって/による/により, which emphasize the causal relationship, ために (tameni) often implies purpose or intention.  It indicates the reason for an action, rather than the cause of an event.  It's similar but slightly different because it is often used for reasons someone does something."

      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "によると/によれば (ni yoruto/ni yoreba) focus specifically on the source of information, while によって/による/により are broader and can express causation or dependence beyond just information sources.  The former is generally used for spoken or written evidence and less for a direct causal relationship."

      "term": "次第",
      "meaning": "As soon as, depending on",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "次第 (shidai) indicates a dependent relationship where one event follows another immediately.  It emphasizes temporal sequence whereas によって/による/により are more about cause and effect, which do not always depend on the timing, only the fact that they have happened."
    },
    {
      "term": "〜かは〜によって違う",
      "meaning": "Whether ~ or not depends on ~",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "This phrase explicitly states the dependence, making it more direct than によって/による/により.  The latter is more subtle, implying the dependence without stating it as overtly.  This is good for showing dependence and showing uncertainty."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these expressions share semantic overlap, their nuances differ subtly.  Consider the context:  If you want to highlight the source of information, use によって/による/により. If you want to focus on the purpose of an action, use ために.  If you want to express the immediate consequence of an event, use 次第.  Paying close attention to context and desired emphasis will help you select the most appropriate expression."
