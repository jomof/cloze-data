    "etymology": "The word 「まだ」 originates from the classical Japanese word 「未だ(imada)」, written with the kanji for 'not yet' (未). Over time, the pronunciation shifted and the word evolved into its modern form, 「まだ」. The etymology reflects its core meaning of something being incomplete or continuing longer than expected.",
    "writeup": "In English, 「まだ」 is regularly translated as 'still' or 'not yet,' depending on whether it is used in a positive non-past or negative sentence. The reason Japanese only requires one word for both of these nuances is due to 「まだ」 literally meaning 'something is unexpectedly still going'. From these sentences, we can see that 「まだ」 may be translated in each case as follows:\n\n*   (Non-past): Although (A) is expected to not be there/happening, it is. This is equivalent to 'still' in English.\n*   (ている form): Although (A) is expected to not still be going, it is. The meaning is then 'not yet' in English.\n\nThe negative form of this will be discussed further in 「まだ〜ていません」.\n\n「まだ」 is the opposite of 「もう」, which means 'something is unexpectedly finished'.\n\n「まだ」 may also be used to ask questions. This is when the speaker thinks something 'might' be continuing but wants or needs to confirm.\n\n**Important Note:**\n\n「まだ」 is often used simply as an expression indicating that something is 'lacking' or 'not yet' where it needs to be. In these cases, 「まだ」 is frequently repeated as 「まだまだ」 for emphasis.",
