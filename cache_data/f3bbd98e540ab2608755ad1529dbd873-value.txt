  "writeup": "“Kahika” (か否か) translates to \"whether or not.\"  It's a formal expression primarily used in writing, often seen in official documents, academic papers, and formal announcements.  The structure is built upon the particle か, meaning 'or,' and 否 (ina), meaning 'no.'  Therefore, the literal meaning is '(A) or no (A).'  This construction allows for concise yet precise expression of a yes/no decision on a given matter.  Note its formality; it wouldn't sound natural in casual conversation.  Its usage often implies a serious consideration or decision-making process.",
  "etymology": "The term originates from the combination of the interrogative particle か (ka), indicating a choice or question, and 否 (iina), a classical form of 'no.'  The use of 否 adds to the formality and precision, contrasting with more casual alternatives like かどうか (kadō ka).",
