  "writeup": "The suffix 化, pronounced 'ka', by itself means 'to change' or 'to transform'.  When combined with する (suru), it creates a verb meaning 'to transform into (A)', where (A) is the noun that 化 is attached to. This is regularly translated as '~ification' or '~ization' in English.  The する part can conjugate like any other verb, allowing for a wide range of expressions.  In formal or scientific writing, the する (and sometimes の) might be omitted, resulting in a noun-like structure. This nuance reflects a shift towards a more concise, technical style.",
  "etymology": "The character 化 (ka) combines 化 (ka - change, transformation) and する (suru - to do).  It's a relatively modern grammatical construction reflecting the influence of Western scientific terminology and the need to concisely express processes of transformation. The use of する allows for the natural flexibility of verb conjugation.",
