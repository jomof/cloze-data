    "etymology": "The 「とも」 in 「ともなく」 comes from 「〜とも」 which expresses uncertainty or indefiniteness. 「なく」 is the adverbial form of the adjective 「ない」, indicating a lack of intention or awareness.",
    "writeup": "「ともなく」 indicates an action performed without much intention or attention, or a situation where the specifics (who, when, where) are unclear. It often implies a sense of absentmindedness or unconscious action. The structure typically involves repeating the same verb before and after 「ともなく」, such as 「見るともなく見る」 (to look without really looking). It can also be used with interrogative words to express that the source or recipient of something is unknown, such as 「どこからともなく」 (from somewhere, but I don't know where exactly) or 「誰にともなく」 (to no one in particular). It's frequently found in formal writing and speech.",
