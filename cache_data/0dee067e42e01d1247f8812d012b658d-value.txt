    "etymology": "The particle を evolved from the classical Japanese particle 'wo,' which itself likely originated from an older form. Its function has remained consistent over time, marking the direct object of a transitive verb.",
    "writeup": "を is a particle in Japanese that marks the **direct object** of a transitive verb. In simple terms, it indicates what receives the action. Think of it as connecting the verb to the thing being acted upon. For example, in 「本を読む」 (hon wo yomu - read a book), 「本」 (hon - book) is the direct object, and を signifies that the action of reading is being done *to* the book.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   Transitive Verbs: を is **only used with transitive verbs**, which are verbs that take a direct object. Intransitive verbs (verbs that do not take a direct object) do not use を.\n*   Word Order: While Japanese word order is flexible, the basic structure is often Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). を helps clarify which noun is the object even if the word order is rearranged.\n*   Pronunciation: Although written as を, it is generally pronounced as 「お」 (o) in modern Japanese.",
