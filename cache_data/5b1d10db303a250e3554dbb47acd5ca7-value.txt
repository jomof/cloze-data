    "etymology": "The grammar point 「につれて」 is derived from the verb 「連れる(つれる)」, meaning \"to lead, take along\". The 「に」 indicates direction or accompaniment, and 「て」 turns it into a connective form, suggesting that something happens in conjunction with something else. Therefore, literally, 「につれて」 means \"as one thing is led along, another thing happens.\"",
    "writeup": "「につれて」, written as 「に連れて」 in kanji, expresses a relationship where change (B) occurs in proportion to change (A). The literal sense is akin to \"being taken along with (A), (B)\" or \"in tow with (A), (B)\", but the meaning is more nuanced. It implies that (A) influences or causes (B) simultaneously; a 'domino' effect. The cause doesn't need to be intentional. It is used after the dictionary form of verbs or after nouns. **Important:** (A)につれて(B) implies that (A) is causing (B) to happen simultaneously.",
