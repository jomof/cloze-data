    "etymology": "The particle 「しか」 is believed to have originated from the adverb 「然 (しか)然るに (しかるに)」, meaning \"in that way\" or \"thus\". Over time, it evolved to emphasize a limited or exclusive condition, often paired with a negative verb to convey \"nothing but\".",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle 「しか」 is similar to 「だけ」 in that it expresses \"only\". However, 「しか」 **must** be used with a negative verb. Therefore, 「しか〜ない」 translates to \"there's only (A)\" or \"there's nothing but (A)\". It can be used with nouns and numbers. When 「しかない」 directly follows a verb, it has a different meaning: \"nothing apart from (A) can be done\". This grammar point focuses on 「しか〜ない」 followed by a noun.",
