        "Register": "Formal, often used in writing or prepared speech.",

    "writeup": "言わば (iwaba) is an adverb that translates to \"so to speak,\" \"as it were,\" or \"sort of.\" It's used to introduce a metaphor, analogy, or approximation. Think of it as adding a layer of nuance, acknowledging that the comparison isn't perfect, but it helps convey the intended meaning. It's more common in formal settings, writing, or prepared speech. It acts as a signal that what follows is not a literal statement, but an illustrative comparison.",
    "etymology": "言わば comes from the verb 言う (iu, to say) in its conditional form 言えば (ieba, if one were to say).  The ば form indicates a hypothetical or conditional statement.  Therefore, 言わば literally means \"if one were to say,\" suggesting that the speaker is offering an alternative way to phrase something, acknowledging it might not be perfectly accurate but useful for understanding.",

            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "「言わば」softens the statement, indicating that the temple is not literally a witness, but it serves a similar function by preserving history. The formal register comes from using お寺「otera」and です「desu」.",
            "etymology": "寺「tera」is a common term for temple. 証人「shounin」 means 'witness' or 'testimony'."

            "setting": "serious",
            "nuance": "The speaker is emphasizing the high stakes of the project. The business context implies formality, so 「言わば」 fits well. The use of 「会社の未来」 (company's future) further reinforces the significance.",
