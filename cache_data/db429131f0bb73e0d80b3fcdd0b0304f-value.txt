  "writeup": "たとえば (or 例えば in its kanji form) is an adverb used to introduce examples.  It translates directly as \"for example.\"  The choice between たとえば and 例えば is subtle.  Generally, 例えば is preferred in more formal writing, while たとえば is common in everyday speech.  The nuance shifts slightly depending on context.  If you are giving a very simple, straightforward example, 例えば is often a better choice. For more detailed or nuanced examples, you might choose a different adverb, such as 詳しく (in detail).",
  "etymology": "The word たとえば is derived from the verb たてる (tate-ru), meaning \"to establish\" or \"to set up,\" and the suffix えば (-eba), which forms a conditional clause.  Therefore, the etymology suggests the meaning of 'if you were to take this as an example...'  It indicates a hypothetical or illustrative case, setting up a specific instance to clarify a point.",
