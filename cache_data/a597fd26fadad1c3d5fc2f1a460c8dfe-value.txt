    "etymology": "The expression 「に限って」 is formed from the particle 「に」, the verb 「限る (かぎる)」 meaning \"to limit\", and its て-form 「限って」.  The 「に」 in this context indicates the specific circumstance or person being focused on.",
    "writeup": "The Japanese expression **に限って (にかぎって)** is used in a few distinct ways, all revolving around the idea of something being specific or exceptional.  There are primarily three main interpretations:\n\n*   **Unbelievable about a specific person/thing:** This usage expresses surprise or disbelief that something negative or unexpected would happen specifically to a particular person or thing. It often carries the nuance of \"of all people/things, why them?\".\n*   **Limited to a specific time/situation:**  This indicates that something occurs only under specific circumstances or at a particular time. It emphasizes the exclusivity of the condition.\n*   **General tendency for a specific group:** This usage describes a common pattern or tendency associated with a certain type of person.  It suggests that those belonging to a particular group are especially prone to a specific behavior or outcome.\n\nWhile each use can be translated as \"only when\" or \"particularly\", understanding the underlying nuance is crucial for accurate interpretation.",
