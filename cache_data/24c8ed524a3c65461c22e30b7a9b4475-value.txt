    "etymology": "The particle 「は」 originally derives from the conditional marker 「ば」. This connection explains its function of setting a broad context or perspective, similar to how a conditional sets a hypothetical scenario. Over time, 「は」 evolved to specifically mark the topic of a sentence, indicating what the speaker assumes the listener already knows or should focus on.",
    "writeup": "「は」 (pronounced *wa*) is often considered one of the most challenging particles in Japanese, alongside 「が」. 「は」 marks the **topic** of the sentence, providing a broad context for the entire statement. In contrast, 「が」 primarily highlights specific actions or statements. The distinction between these two will be covered in more detail later. In many sentences, particularly shorter ones, either 「は」 or 「が」 can be used naturally, depending on whether the speaker is simply stating something (「は」) or emphasizing it (「が」). \n\nWhen 「は」 marks the topic, it sets the stage for what the sentence will discuss. However, 「は」 cannot be used to describe immediate, in-the-moment experiences, as these events are considered part of a larger context (like the whole day). \n\n「は」 has two main functions: marking the topic and indicating contrast or comparison. While there are no strict rules, 「は」 used in the middle or later part of a sentence often carries a contrasting nuance. The listener might infer that a comparison is being made.",
