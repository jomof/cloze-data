    "etymology": "The term 「けれども」 is derived from 「けれど」, which itself comes from the verb 「蹴る (keru)」 meaning \"to kick\" or \"to reject.\" The 「も (mo)」 is an added particle. Over time, 「けれど」 became a conjunction, and the addition of 「も」 further softened and emphasized the contrastive nature of the conjunction.",
    "writeup": "「けれども」 is a formal conjunctive particle similar to 「けど」, meaning \"but\" or \"although.\" It connects two sentences, highlighting a contrast or concession. While 「けど」 is more casual, 「けれども」 adds a layer of formality, making it suitable for polite conversations or written contexts. It indicates that the speaker is aware of the first part of the sentence (A), but the second part (B) is still relevant or important. Unlike 「が」, which can also mean \"but,\" 「けれども」 often carries a slightly stronger sense of \"although,\" implying a degree of acceptance or understanding of the first clause despite the contrast. The listing from the most casual to the most formal is: Casual - 「けど」 - 「けども」 - 「けれど」 - 「けれども」 - 「が」 - Formal.",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "humorous",
            "nuance": "The use of 「けれども」 here indicates a playful contradiction. The speaker ate dinner but implies they're still open to something more, perhaps dessert. It softens the statement, making it less direct.",
            "etymology": "The sentence has a playful tone due to the ellipsis 「。」, suggesting that while dinner was eaten, there's room for something else."

            "register": "semi-formal",
            "setting": "friendly",
            "nuance": "「でしょう」 is used to express the speaker's conjecture or expectation that the listener likes the book. The 「けれども」 sets up the contrast between the speaker's dislike and the listener's potential enjoyment.",
            "etymology": "The phrase 「好きでしょう」 uses the auxiliary verb 「でしょう」 to express a polite conjecture or expectation."

            "nuance": "The 「けれども」 highlights the speaker's disappointment that the cleaning effort was insufficient.",

            "nuance": "「けれども」 is used to present a contrasting aspect to the convenience of trains: the fact that they are usually crowded.",
            "etymology": "The sentence uses 「便利だ」 (benri da), which means \"convenient.\" The 「だ」 is necessary because 「便利」 is a な-adjective."
