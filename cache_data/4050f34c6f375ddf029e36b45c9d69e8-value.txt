  "writeup": "The negative past tense of う-verbs describes actions that did not occur in the past.  To form it, you modify the final vowel of the dictionary form.  For the plain form, change the final 'u' sound to 'a' and add \"なかった\". For the polite form, change the final 'u' to 'i' and add \"ませんでした\".  A common, albeit grammatically less strict, semi-polite form exists: add \"です\" to the plain negative past form.  The exception is the verb \"ある\" (to exist/be), which uses \"なかった\" for both casual and semi-polite past negative and \"ありませんでした\" for polite past negative, demonstrating a divergence from regular う-verb conjugation. This grammatical point is used broadly across all registers and genders.",
  "etymology": "The negative past tense particles なかった and ませんでした are formed from the negative ない and the past tense marker た.  The addition of です to なかった is a colloquial shortening of でした, which explains its frequent use and acceptance.",

      "conjugation": "plain negative past",

      "conjugation": "semi-polite negative past",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "Adding 「です」to 「行かなかった」creates a slightly softer, semi-formal tone, still common amongst younger speakers."
