    "etymology": "「られる」 is an auxiliary verb that attaches to the stem of a verb. Its origins can be traced back to the Classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「る」, which indicated passive, potential, or spontaneous action. Over time, 「る」 evolved into 「られる」 in modern Japanese, primarily used to express passive voice and, in some cases, respect.",
    "writeup": "The passive form 「られる」 indicates that someone or something is being acted upon. It conveys the sense of \"to be -ed\" in English.\n\n*   For **Group 1 (u-verbs)**, change the final 「う」 sound to its 「あ」 equivalent and add 「れる」. Example: 読む (yomu, to read) becomes 読まれる (yomareru, to be read).\n*   For **Group 2 (ru-verbs)**, simply add 「られる」 to the verb stem. Example: 食べる (taberu, to eat) becomes 食べられる (taberareru, to be eaten).\n*   **Irregular Verbs**:\n    *   する (suru, to do) becomes される (sareru, to be done).\n    *   来る (kuru, to come) becomes 来られる (korareru, to be come).\n\n    Understanding the passive voice is essential for comprehending news reports, formal writing, and situations where the actor is unknown or unimportant.",
