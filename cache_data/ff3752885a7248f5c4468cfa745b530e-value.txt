        "Verb[masu-stem] + やがる": "Expresses scorn or disdain at someone's actions."
    },
    "jlpt": "N0",
    "meaning": "To have the nerve to (A), To have the gall to (A), To freaking (A)",

        "Register": "Very informal; often considered vulgar.",
        "Usage": "Primarily used by men.",
        "Connotation": "Expresses strong negative feelings, such as anger, disgust, or contempt."
    },
    "etymology": "「やがる」 is derived from the verb 「上がる(あがる)」, meaning \"to rise\" or \"to go up.\" In this context, it implies that the action is \"rising up\" to a level of audacity or impudence that provokes the speaker's anger or scorn. However, the etymological connection is not readily apparent to most speakers.",
    "writeup": "「やがる」 is a colloquial expression, primarily used by men, to express scorn, disdain, or anger towards someone else's actions. It is considered quite vulgar, so use it with caution and be aware of your audience. It's often translated as \"to have the nerve to,\" \"to have the gall to,\" or even with a more emphatic expletive like \"to freaking do something.\" It attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. \n\nThough 「やがる」 is derived from 「上がる(あがる)」, its meaning is quite different and the connection is not obvious to the modern Japanese speaker. Importantly, 「やがる」 is almost exclusively used by men.",
