  "writeup": "In Japanese, the non-past form of verbs is identical to the dictionary form or casual form.  Unlike English, this single form handles situations requiring various conjugations in English.  We'll see how this one Japanese form covers English verbs with '-s' endings (sees, hears, goes), verbs using 'will' (will see, will hear, will go), and unconjugated verbs (see, hear, go).  Because this single form encompasses multiple nuances, using time expressions is crucial for clarity. Without a time word, the sentence implies a general, timeless truth.  The non-past form essentially expresses three core ideas: general facts, habits, or future events.  **Caution:** Books frequently use the non-past form for events happening 'in the moment' without explicit time words.  Context usually clarifies the immediate timeframe.",
  "etymology": "The non-past form's etymology is rooted in the inherent structure of Japanese verb conjugation.  The dictionary form, often considered the base, directly conveys the action without temporal modification.  This contrasts sharply with English, where temporal inflection is more directly bound to the verb's root.",
