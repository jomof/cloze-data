    "etymology": "Derived from 「と言う」 (to say) indicating a preceding statement or assumption, and 「か」 marking it as a question or topic of consideration. Thus, it sets up a question of whether the preceding statement is actually true before presenting the contrary.",
    "writeup": "「かと言うと」 is used to introduce a statement that contradicts a common belief or logical expectation. It's like saying, \"You would think that..., but actually...\" or \"Contrary to what you might expect...\". The part before 「かと言うと」 often sets up a generally accepted idea, and what follows presents a contrasting reality. It is useful in persuasive speech and essays, or in response to a question or statement.",
