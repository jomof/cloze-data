    "etymology": "「と」 is a particle indicating quotation or comparison. 「でも」 indicates something like 'or something like that'. 「言う」 is the verb 'to say'. 「べき」 means 'should' or 'ought to'. So, literally, it means 'something that should be said as'.",
    "writeup": "「とでも言うべき」 is a phrase used to introduce a noun or noun phrase that describes the nature of someone or something. It conveys that the speaker is suggesting a way to characterize the subject, often implying it's not a perfect or definitive description, but a fitting one. It's often used in formal writing and speech to add nuance and precision. You're essentially saying, \"it could be called...\" or \"it's something that could be described as...\".",
