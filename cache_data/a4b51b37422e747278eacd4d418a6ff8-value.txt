    "writeup": "As briefly mentioned in the explanation for the 「そんな」 grammar point, the こそあど言葉 (kosoado kotoba - demonstrative words) sometimes appear in the forms 「こんな」, 「そんな」, 「あんな」, or 「どんな」. 「どんな」 itself is a shortened form of 「どのような」, meaning \"in what way\" or \"what kind of\". When combined with 「に」 (to form an adverb) and 「ても」, 「どんなに～ても」 is used to express that the extent of something is insufficient to change a result. It translates to \"no matter how (A), (B)\".  「どんなに」 can be attached to any type of word, as long as it's followed by 「でも」 (for nouns or な-adjectives) or 「ても」 (for い-adjectives or verbs).  The literal sense of 「どんなに～ても」 is \"even if (A) is in whatever way, (B)\".",
    "etymology": "「どんなに」 comes from 「どう」 (how) + 「な」 (a form that turns it into an adjectival noun, here modifying the degree) + 「に」 (adverbial particle). 「ても」 is the て-form of 「てもいい」 (even if it's okay to).  So, literally, it's like saying \"even if it's okay in whatever way\".",
