    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the particle に with the negative potential form of a verb. The first verb, in dictionary form, indicates the action one *wants* to do, and the second, in negative potential form, indicates the inability to perform that action. The literal sense is like saying, \"Regarding doing X, I cannot do X.\"",
    "writeup": "The pattern **に + verb (dictionary form) + potential form of the same verb + ない** (or other negative form) expresses the idea that someone wants to do something, but is unable to due to circumstances.  You can think of it as \"want to do X, but can't do X.\" The particle **に** follows the dictionary form of the verb, and the potential form of the *same* verb is then negated with **ない**. For verbs ending in **-る**, the potential form is usually formed by replacing **る** with **られる**. For verbs ending in **-う**, **-く**, **-ぐ**, **-す**, **-つ**, **-ぬ**, **-ぶ**, **-む**, **-る**, the potential form is formed by changing the last vowel sound to the 'e' sound and adding **る** (e.g., 書く becomes 書ける).  The irregular verb する becomes できる in its potential form. So, when using する in this pattern, you'll use **するにできない**.  \n\n**Important Consideration:** Sometimes, instead of the dictionary form, you might see the volitional form (ending in **-う** or **-よう**) followed by **にも**. The meaning remains the same, but the nuance shifts slightly. The dictionary form tends to emphasize psychological or internal reasons for the inability, while the volitional form highlights more concrete or external reasons.",
