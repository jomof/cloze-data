    "writeup": "The grammar point **べきではない** (or **べきじゃない**) expresses a strong sense of advisability against doing something. It translates to \"should not,\" \"must not,\" or \"ought not to.\"  It's the negative form of **べき**, which means \"ought to.\"  Like **べき**, **べきではない** implies that performing the action would be improper or incorrect. It is used with the plain form (dictionary form) of a verb.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The **は** in **べきではない** can be omitted, making it **べきでない**. However, including **は** slightly strengthens the negation. Without **は**, the phrase sounds a bit weaker.\n*   Regarding the verb **する (to do)**, both **するべきではない** and **すべきではない** are grammatically correct and commonly used.",
