    "etymology": "この belongs to the 'ko-so-a-do' system (こそあど体系) in Japanese, which is used to indicate the proximity of objects or places to the speaker and listener.  この is related to the demonstrative pronoun これ (this) and the place word ここ (here). It signifies something closer to the speaker.",
    "writeup": "この is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞 *rentaishi*) in Japanese. These words, also sometimes called demonstrative adjectives, always precede and modify nouns. They indicate that the noun being modified is \"this\" one, usually implying it's near the speaker. Like other words in the *kosoado* system, such as これ (*kore*) and ここ (*koko*), この helps to specify the location or identity of a noun relative to the speaker.",
