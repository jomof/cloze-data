    "writeup": "**どうも** (doumo) is a versatile adverb with several distinct meanings. Most commonly, it expresses a feeling of uncertainty, difficulty, or inability. It can also convey that something seems a certain way based on available information. Additionally, it is used as a general expression of gratitude or greeting, but this entry will focus on the adverbial usages.\n\n*   When used with a negative verb or adjective, **どうも** indicates that one cannot do something or has a negative impression of something. It suggests that there's an underlying reason or feeling that prevents the action or creates the impression.\n*   When used with 「らしい」 or 「ようだ」, **どうも** implies that the speaker is making a conjecture or gathering information from what they observe. It indicates a degree of uncertainty, as the conclusion isn't based on definitive proof. For example, 「どうも...らしい」 translates to \"I gather that...\" or \"It seems like...\"."
    ,
    "etymology": "The etymology of **どうも** is debated, but it is believed to have originated from the phrase 「道理も (dou ri mo)」, meaning \"reason\" or \"principle\". Over time, it evolved to express uncertainty or a lack of clear reason, eventually becoming the multifaceted adverb we know today. In modern usage, 「どうも」 carries a nuance of indirectness or reservation, suggesting that the speaker isn't entirely sure or cannot fully explain their reasoning.",
