    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に則って」 comes from the particle 「に」 and the te-form of the verb 「則る（のっとる）」, meaning \"to conform to,\" \"to be based on,\" or \"to follow.\" The verb 「則る」 itself is derived from the noun 「則（のり）」, which means \"rule,\" \"law,\" or \"standard.\"",
    "writeup": "「に則って」 is a formal expression indicating that something is done **according to** or **in accordance with** a certain rule, law, standard, or principle. It emphasizes adherence to an established guideline or system. The particle 「に」 indicates the basis or standard, and 「則って」 is the te-form of the verb 「則る（のっとる）」, meaning \"to conform to\" or \"to be based on.\"  The variation 「に則り」 serves the same purpose but is even more formal and often found in written documents or official announcements. The subject of 「に則って」 is usually an action or decision that aligns with the specified rule or standard. The noun preceding 「に則って」 generally refers to established norms, regulations, or long-standing practices.",
