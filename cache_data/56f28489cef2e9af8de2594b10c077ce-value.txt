  "writeup": "The grammar point どんなに〜ても translates to \"no matter how.\"  It emphasizes that the action or state described in the second clause (B) remains true regardless of the degree or extent expressed in the first clause (A).  The structure is built around どんな (what kind of) which is often shortened from どのような.  Combined with に (marking an adverbial modifier) and ても (even if), the phrase indicates an unyielding condition.  The \"A\" part can be a noun, na-adjective, i-adjective, or verb, with minor adjustments for proper grammatical form.  For example, with nouns and na-adjectives, use でも; with i-adjectives and verbs, use ても.  This nuanced expression conveys a sense of inevitability or resilience, highlighting the persistence of (B) despite the variations in (A).",
  "etymology": "The core of this grammar point lies in どんな, a contraction of どのような (dōyōna), meaning 'of what kind' or 'what sort of.'  The addition of に transforms it into an adverbial phrase modifying the degree or extent. ても, originating from the te-form of verbs, adds the concessive meaning of 'even if' or 'no matter how.'  The combination thus elegantly expresses a condition that remains unaffected by varying degrees or extents.",
