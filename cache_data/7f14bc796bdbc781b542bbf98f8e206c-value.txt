    "etymology": "「どの」 belongs to the same family of interrogative words as 「どれ」 (which one) and 「どこ」 (where). It functions as a pre-noun adjectival, specifying which item from a group is being referred to or inquired about.",
    "writeup": "「どの」 is a pre-noun adjectival, meaning it always appears before a noun to modify it. It doesn't conjugate, maintaining a consistent form. It's used to inquire about 'which' item when there are **three or more** options. Think of it as asking for a specific choice from a larger set.  It is related to words like 「どれ」 and 「どこ」. 「どの」 can be used in questions or to express something similar to \"whatever\" or \"whichever.\"\n\n**Important Consideration:** 「どの」 is exclusively for scenarios with three or more choices. When only two options are available, use 「どっち (の)」 or 「どちら (の)」 instead. For example, to ask which of two colors someone prefers, use 「どっち」, but if asking what color someone likes in general, use 「どの」.",
