  "writeup": "The expression に関わらず conveys 'regardless of (A)', 'no matter if (A)', or 'with or without (A)'. It combines に, the -u verb 関わる ('to be affected', 'to be influenced'), and the literary auxiliary ず, functioning similarly to ない. This structure works with verbs or adjectives in their dictionary or negative forms, and with nouns in their dictionary form.  Often, the same word is repeated in positive and negative forms, or paired with かどうか to emphasize 'whether (A) or not (A)'.  Literally meaning 'without being influenced by (A), (B)', the primary nuance is that (B) occurs irrespective of (A). Thus, に関わらず can also indicate that 'any type of (A) results in the same (B)'.  It's predominantly used in formal settings.",
  "etymology": "The particle に marks the topic.  関わる (kawaru) is a verb meaning \"to be related to\" or \"to be involved in.\"  The negative auxiliary ず (zu) adds a sense of regardlessness or non-dependence.  The combination creates the meaning of \"regardless of.\" The formal register stems from the use of the -u verb and the literary auxiliary ず.",
