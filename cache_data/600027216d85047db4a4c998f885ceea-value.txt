    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にしろ」 comes from 「に」 (a particle indicating reason or cause) and 「しろ」, which is the imperative form of the verb 「する」 (to do). The phrase suggests a sense of 'even if it is the case,' or 'granted that it is,' implying that the specific condition does not change the outcome.",
    "writeup": "「にしろ〜にしろ」 is used to express that a certain condition or situation does not affect the overall result or truth. It often translates to \"whether... or.\" Essentially, it emphasizes that **regardless of the alternatives presented, the main point remains the same**.\n\n*   The structure involves repeating 「にしろ」 after two contrasting possibilities.\n*   These possibilities can be verbs, adjectives, or nouns.\n*   Mixing 「にしろ」 with 「にせよ」 is grammatically correct, but unnatural. Choose one and stick with it.\n*   This pattern is often used with antonyms to indicate a broad range of possibilities.",
