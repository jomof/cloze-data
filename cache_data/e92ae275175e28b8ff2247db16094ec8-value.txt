  "writeup": "The grammar point 決して〜ない means \"never\" or \"by no means.\"  決して itself originates from the te-form of 決する (kessuru), meaning \"to decide.\" However, 決して functions independently as an adverb, signifying \"decidedly\" or \"assuredly.\" Its crucial role is to intensify the negation ない, creating a stronger emphasis on the impossibility or non-occurrence of an action or state.  It's typically placed before the ない form of a verb or adjective. While translating to \"never,\" its literal nuance is closer to \"decidedly not\" or \"assuredly not.\"  This emphasizes the definitive nature of the negation. Importantly, 決して can appear at the sentence's beginning or directly before the negated word.  While commonly used with negative forms, it occasionally pairs with non-negative structures, notably ものか (which we'll cover later). ものか reinforces the non-existence or impossibility of something.",
  "etymology": "The word 決して (kesshite) comes from the te-form of the verb 決する (kessuru), meaning \"to decide.\"  Over time, it evolved into a standalone adverbial intensifier of negation.",
