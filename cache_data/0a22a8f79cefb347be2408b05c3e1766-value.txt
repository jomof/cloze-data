    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from the て-form of a verb combined with the particle 「は」and the negative potential form of 「行く」 (iku), meaning 'to go'. Literally, it means 'it is not allowed to go' or 'it is not acceptable'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[て]+はいけない」 is used to express a strong prohibition, indicating that something **must not** or **cannot** be done. While 「は」 is often omitted in other grammatical structures, it's generally retained here to avoid misinterpretation of 「いけない」 as a subsequent action. In casual speech, 「ては」 often contracts to 「ちゃ」, and 「では」 to 「じゃ」, simplifying the phrase. While 「いけない」 is fairly neutral and common in both speech and writing, 「ならない」 carries a more formal tone, mainly used in written language. 「だめ」 is very casual, almost exclusively used in spoken language.",

            "nuance": "The speaker uses 「いけません」, the polite form of 「いけない」, showing respect to the listener. Since the speaker is a man and the listener is a woman, 「いけません」is a neutral and polite way to convey the prohibition."

In contrast, 「なくてはいけない」 expresses 'must do'. Expressions like 「べきではない」 add a layer of moral obligation, and 「べからず」 is rarely encountered in modern speech. Pay attention to context and register to use the most appropriate phrase."
