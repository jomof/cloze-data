    "etymology": "The grammar point 「そばから」 combines 「側 (そば)」, meaning \"side\" or \"vicinity,\" and 「から」, the case marking particle indicating \"from.\" The literal sense is \"from right beside,\" suggesting something that happens immediately following or originating very close to another event.",
    "writeup": "「そばから」 combines the noun 「側 (そば)」 meaning \"side,\" and the particle 「から」 meaning \"from.\" It describes something (B) that happens immediately after (A), often with an implication that (B) is undesirable, negates (A), or is a recurring issue. A helpful way to remember the nuance is thinking of (B) happening \"right beside\" (A). It is usually something that is considered annoying, unfavorable, or somehow nullifies (A) by the speaker, but there are exceptions.\n\n「そばから」 follows verbs in either their dictionary or past-tense forms without changing the meaning—it always implies immediacy. It almost always suggests that (B) *always* happens upon (A), rather than being a one-time occurrence.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   While 「そばから」 can sometimes be translated as \"even if...still,\" this usage is less common. The primary meaning is \"as soon as\" or \"right after.\"\n*   The register is formal 「硬い」.",
