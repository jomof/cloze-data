    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことだ」combines the noun 「こと」, meaning 'thing' or 'matter', with the copula 「だ」, indicating a declaration or assertion. Thus, it literally implies 'it is the thing that...' or 'it is the matter that...', which evolves into expressing a sense of advisability or obligation.",
    "writeup": "「ことだ」functions as a sentence-ending particle with two primary uses, though we'll focus on the first here:\n\n*   Highlighting a desire or weak command. (Most common)\n*   Highlighting astonishment or doubt. (Primarily used by women, less common today)\n\nWhen used at the end of a sentence, 「こと」is paired with the dictionary (or 「ない」) form of a verb to emphasize an action that should or should not occur. Often, it's grouped with the auxiliary verb 「だ」, though not always. This construction typically translates to \"should/should not (A)\" or \"ought to/not (A).\"\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   This usage implies a degree of authority, often seen in rules and expectations (like signs in shops or parks).\n*   Avoid using it for general advice, especially to those of higher status.",
