  },
  "etymology": "The suffix \"ら\" shares its origins with the character 等 (とう, tō), meaning 'etc.' or 'and so on'.  The pluralizing sense derives from this inclusive 'and so on,' implying a group larger than just one. This etymological root explains its slightly informal and potentially dismissive connotation.",
  "writeup": "In Japanese, the suffix \"~ra\" adds a plural sense to pronouns.  It's often called a \"pluralizing suffix,\" but its function is slightly nuanced.  It's more accurate to think of it as indicating 'more than one' or, more literally, '(A) etc.' or '(A) and so on'. Attach it to the end of any pronoun to create a plural form. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* Because \"~ra\" literally means something akin to '(A) etc.,'  it can sound a bit informal or even dismissive, particularly when referring to people.  Using it in reference to individuals, especially those deserving respect, is generally discouraged.  For polite pluralization, consider using the suffix \"達\" (たち, -tachi) instead.  This is overwhelmingly preferred when talking about people.\n*  While grammatically correct, avoiding \"~ra\" with personal pronouns in formal settings is essential to maintain politeness.  \n* The use of \"~ra\" is generally restricted to casual speech and informal settings.",
