        "Usage": "Used to describe actions or expressions that strongly suggest a particular message or feeling. Often carries a nuance of exaggeration or theatricality."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とばかりに」 combines the particle 「と」 (indicating a quote or content of thought), 「ばかり」 (meaning 'just' or 'only,' but here implying 'as if doing nothing else but'), and 「に」 (a particle indicating purpose or result). Thus, it literally translates to 'as if doing nothing else but saying/implying [something].'",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「とばかりに」 is used to express that someone does something in a way that strongly suggests a particular thought, feeling, or intention. It's similar to saying \"as if to say\" in English. The action is performed so emphatically that it leaves little doubt about the person's feelings or intentions. It often carries a nuance of exaggeration or theatricality. It is generally used in formal writing and speech.",
