  "writeup": "The Japanese adverbial phrase あとで (ato de) means \"after\" or \"later.\"  It's a combination of 後 (ato, behind, after) and the particle で (de, indicating means or manner).  Think of it as \"in the manner of after.\"  You attach it to the end of a verb stem (typically in its plain, non-past form, though other forms are possible), a noun phrase marked with の (no), or a nominalized clause ending in のは (no wa).  The nuance is subtly different from other similar expressions; it emphasizes that the action occurs *after* something else, focusing on the timing in relation to the preceding event.  It's a versatile phrase used in various conversational contexts. The etymology reflects the sequential nature of events in Japanese, similar to the carriages of a train following the engine.  The position of あとで can also subtly modify the overall meaning, with initial placement suggesting a less immediate future timing compared to end placement.",
  "etymology": "The term 'あとで' is a compound word comprised of 'あと' (ato), meaning 'after' or 'later,' which is derived from '後' (ushiro, meaning 'behind' or 'rear'), and 'で' (de), a particle indicating the manner or means of an action. The use of '後' to express 'after' stems from the conceptualization of time as a sequential progression; what comes 'behind' the initial event is what occurs afterward.",
