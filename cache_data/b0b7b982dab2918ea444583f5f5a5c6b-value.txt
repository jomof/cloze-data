    "etymology": "The slang 「って」is thought to have originated as a shortened and more casual version of 「という」, which can also be used to mark topics or introduce information. Over time, it evolved into its current function as a topic marker and quotation marker, primarily in spoken language.",
    "writeup": "「って」 is a slang term primarily used in spoken Japanese as a casual alternative to the topic marker 「は」. It directly follows the topic of the sentence, similar to how 「は」 functions. This usage is more informal and is rarely seen in formal writing. It can also function as a casual quotation marker, replacing 「と」, but this explanation focuses on its use as a topic marker.",
