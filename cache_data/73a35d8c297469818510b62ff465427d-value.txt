    "etymology": "The suffix 「っぱなし」 originally comes from the verb 「放す (hanasu)」, which means \"to let go\" or \"to release\". However, 「っぱなし」 carries a nuance closer to \"being unchecked\" or \"left unattended\". Thus, it implies that something is continuing without anyone stopping it or that something is left in a certain state without being taken care of.",
    "writeup": "「っぱなし」 is a suffix attached to the ます-stem of verbs, indicating that something has been left in a certain state, often with a negative connotation. It conveys a sense of negligence or a lack of attention to the consequences of leaving something as is. It can describe actions that continue without stopping or states that remain unchanged. Consider the difference in nuance from 「放す (hanasu)」, as 「っぱなし」 often implies something is \"unchecked\".",
