    "etymology": "「それなのに」 is a combination of 「それ」(demonstrative pronoun meaning 'that'), 「な」(a form of the copula だ), and 「のに」(a conjunction expressing 'although' or 'despite'). The phrase evolved to express a stronger sense of contradiction or unexpectedness than 「のに」 alone.",
    "writeup": "「それなのに」 acts as a conjunction meaning \"and yet\" or \"despite that.\" It refers back to a previous statement, introducing a contradictory or unexpected outcome. Because it's a conjunction, 「それなのに」 usually appears at the beginning of a new sentence.\n\nThe (B) sentence is in contradiction to the (A) sentence; 「それなのに」 often indicates something unexpected or unpredictable based on (A).",
