    "etymology": "The verb 「いたす」is the humble form of 「する」 (to do). Its kanji form is 「致す」, which carries the nuance of 'dedicating oneself to doing something'. This etymology highlights its use in situations where the speaker wants to show respect or deference to the listener through humble language.",
    "writeup": "「いたす」, often written as 「致す」, is a humble speech (謙譲語) u-verb that refers to the speaker's actions or those within their inner circle (e.g., their company). Similar to 「お〜する」, 「いたす」 means \"to do.\"\n\n*   For 「する」 verbs, simply replace 「する」 with 「いたす」.\n*   For other verbs, add 「いたす」 to the ます-stem of the verb, while attaching 「お」 or 「ご」 to the beginning, depending on whether the word is of Japanese or Chinese origin. Note that 「お」 is typically used for native Japanese words, and 「ご」 is used for words of Chinese origin.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Words that include the kanji 「拝」 (\"to worship\" or \"to revere\") usually do not require 「お」, 「ご」, or 「いたす」 because the word itself is respectful.\n*   「いたす」 is considered slightly more humble than 「お〜する」, so it's frequently heard in advertisements or used by company employees.",
