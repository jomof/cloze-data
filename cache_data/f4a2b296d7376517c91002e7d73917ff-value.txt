  "writeup": "といった is a fairly casual expression used to list items, similar to structures like などの or のような.  Derived from と (and) and the past-tense form of the u-verb 言う (to say), といった is often translated as '(B) such as (A)' or '(B) like (A)'.  Crucially, といった is always followed directly by a noun representing the general category to which (B) belongs. The literal meaning is closer to '(B) that can be called (A)'.  Both (A) and (B) will be nouns.  As shown in some examples below, constructions like や and とか can be used if multiple (B) items fit into the category of (A).",
  "etymology": "The phrase といった comes from the verb 言う (iu), meaning 'to say'.  The form といった is a past tense form, suggesting a retrospective listing or summarization of examples. The particle と combines items in a list.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "私の父は、ゲートボールといったスポーツが好きだそうです。",
      "english": "Apparently, my father likes sports such as gateball.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses だそうです, indicating indirect hearsay, which is common in semi-formal settings.  There's nothing inherently gendered or age-specific about this sentence."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたの国ではおはぎといった和菓子は売られていますか？",
      "english": "Are Japanese sweets, such as ohagi, sold in your country?",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "interrogative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite form  売られていますか？ makes this suitable for any interaction where politeness is expected.  Again, nothing inherently gendered or age-specific here."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "旦那は洗濯や料理といった家事は一切しません。",
      "english": "My husband doesn't do any housework such as laundry or cooking.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register is evident in the use of 旦那 (danna) and the plain form しません. This would typically be used by a wife speaking about her husband in a casual setting. 「旦那」 is typically used by a wife."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "私は生姜とかパクチーといった香味野菜を使った料理が苦手です。",
      "english": "I'm not good at cooking with herbs like ginger and cilantro.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual tone is conveyed through the plain form 苦手です and the use of とか (toka). This could be spoken by anyone, regardless of age or gender."

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "instructive",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of はいけない (should not) and the absence of sentence-final particles makes this formally appropriate. The structure is quite general and would not be associated with any specific gender or age group."

      "japanese": "彼と、映画を見に行ったり、カフェでコーヒーを飲んだりといった、ロマンチックな時間を過ごしたい。",
      "english": "I want to spend romantic time with him, like going to the movies or drinking coffee at a cafe.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of たり～たり and the focus on romantic activities clearly indicates a flirty context.  「彼と」 (with him) would be typical phrasing, not inherently gendered."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "週末は、散歩したり、本を読んだりといった、のんびりとした時間を過ごしたいです。",
      "english": "I'd like to spend a relaxing weekend, doing things such as taking a walk or reading a book.",

      "meaning": "Among other things, For example, Such as",
      "kind": "synonym",

      "term": "など",
      "meaning": "Such as, Things like, Etc., And so on",
