    "etymology": "The term 「割(わり)」 means \"proportion\" or \"ratio.\" The 「に」 particle indicates direction or purpose. Therefore, 「割に」 literally translates to \"in proportion to,\" but is used to express that something is disproportionate or unexpected relative to something else.",
    "writeup": "「割に」 is an adverbial phrase used to express a sense of disproportion or unexpectedness. It conveys that something is *not* as one would expect, considering a particular factor or condition. It's similar to saying \"although,\" \"despite,\" or \"rather...for\" in English.\n\n**Key points:**\n*   「割に」 often highlights a contrast or contradiction.\n*   It compares something to expectations within its category.\n*   It can appear at the beginning of a sentence or after the word/phrase it modifies.\n*   When following a noun or a な-adjective, use 「の」 or 「な」, respectively.\n\nWhile 「割に」 implies a comparison, it's important to note that it compares something to itself based on expectations, rather than comparing it directly to something else.",
