  "writeup": "This grammar point, じゃないか (janai ka), adds a questioning nuance to a statement.  It's like adding 'isn't it?' or 'is it not?' to the end of a sentence in English, expressing a degree of expectation or seeking confirmation.  It's generally considered informal, suitable for conversations with close friends or family.  The construction essentially combines the negative form of the copula verb だ (da) – じゃない (janai) – with the particle か (ka), which marks a question.  While じゃないか attaches to various sentence types,  its usage requires sensitivity to context and relationship with the listener. Using it inappropriately can sound blunt or even rude in more formal settings.",
  "etymology": "The grammar point じゃないか is a combination of two elements: じゃない (janai), the informal negative form of the copula だ (da), meaning 'is not,' and か (ka), a question particle.  The combination creates a colloquial way to express an inquisitive, slightly assertive statement.  The origins lie in the casual nature of the negative copula, evolving into a common expression of implied questioning.",

      "japanese": "キヨコはもうすぐ来る**じゃないか**。",
      "english": "Isn't Kiyoko coming soon?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a simple, straightforward question, appropriate for casual conversation between friends. The use of 「じゃないか」 makes it sound light and friendly, rather than a direct inquiry."

    {
      "japanese": "そのカメラは高い**じゃないか**。",
      "english": "That camera is expensive, isn't it?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a casual observation seeking agreement. The speaker believes the camera is expensive and expects the listener to concur. 「じゃないか」 softens the statement, making it more conversational."

    {
      "japanese": "この着物は綺麗**じゃないか**。",

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "In this flirty context, the male speaker uses 「じゃないか」 to subtly express admiration for the woman's kimono and seeks a positive response.  The casual tone adds a playful element to the compliment."

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "casual",
      "conjugation": null,

      "japanese": "これは台風の影響**ではないか**。",
      "english": "This is likely due to the typhoon, isn't it?",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「ではないか」 instead of 「じゃないか」 increases formality, suitable for a slightly more formal interaction than the previous examples.  The nuance suggests a higher degree of certainty compared to a casual 「じゃないか」."

    {
      "japanese": "遊んでないで明日のテストの勉強をした方がいい**んではないか**。",

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "interrogative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a slightly more assertive question, implying that the listener may have forgotten their mother's instructions. The past tense 「じゃなかったか」 adds emphasis to the reminder."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while じゃないか is generally informal, the level of informality can vary depending on the context and your relationship with the person you are speaking to.  Using it with a superior or in a formal situation would be inappropriate. Consider using ではないか for more formal contexts, though even this can sometimes sound overly stiff.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember the subtle differences in assertiveness and politeness.  じゃないか is a fairly direct, but informal, question seeking confirmation.  Other similar expressions range from more tentative (のではないだろうか) to more assertive (でしょう, だろう), or simply express possibility (かもしれない) rather than a question."
