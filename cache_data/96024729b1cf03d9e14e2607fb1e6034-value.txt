  "writeup": "でもなんでもない (demo nan demo nai) is a phrase used after nouns or な-adjectives to emphatically express negation.  It literally translates to something like \"not even this or anything else,\" conveying a strong sense of 'definitely not' or 'absolutely not.'  This construction uses でも (demo) meaning 'even,' なん (nan) meaning 'anything at all' or 'whatever,' and ない (nai) the negative form of the adjective ない.  The overall effect is stronger than a simple negation.  It can be used in both positive and negative contexts; in positive contexts, it often implies something is inconsequential or not a big deal. For example, 仕事でもなんでもない (shigoto demo nan demo nai desu) might mean \"It's not work at all; it's just a simple task.\"  While less common, some sources also include い-adjective (く) forms combined with もなんでもない.",

      "nuance": "The particle よ (yo) and the sentence-final casual form are typical of male speech.  The use of 「ただ～だけ」 (tada~dake) adds to the casual and dismissive tone. The phrase 「ファンでもなんでもない」 (fan demo nan demo nai) strongly emphasizes the speaker's lack of fandom."

      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite です (desu) ending and the formal phrasing are standard polite speech.  The explanation 「なんかさっき急に話しかけてきたので」 (nanka sakki kyuu ni hanashikakete kita node) adds context, making the response seem less abrupt."

      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual sentence ending and the use of 「全然」 (zenzen) amplify the speaker's negative feeling.  The phrase 「好きでもなんでもない人」 (suki demo nan demo nai hito) emphasizes the unimportance of the speaker's feelings towards the person."

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「あいつ」 (aitsu) is slightly informal and often used by females.  The plain sentence ending is casual.  The reason for the lack of sadness is clearly stated, making the overall statement more impactful. The phrase 「悲しくでもなんでもない」 (kanashiku demo nan demo nai) adds emphasis to the speaker's lack of sadness."

The contrasting use of 「遊び」 (asobi) 'playing' and 「嫌がらせ」 (iyagarase) 'harassment' highlights the seriousness of the situation."

Consider the context and the desired level of emphasis when choosing between these two expressions."
