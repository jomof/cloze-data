  "writeup": "The adverb ますます means \"increasingly,\" \"more and more,\" or even \"to keep -ing.\"  It emphasizes continuous trends and frequently appears at the sentence's beginning.  The kanji form 益々 is sometimes used, with no change in nuance; 益 simply means 'gain'.  Interestingly, despite sometimes appearing as 益々, this expression originates from the repetition of 増す (masu), a 'u' verb meaning 'to increase'.  Therefore, ますます is most effectively used with verbs implying change or with adjectives capable of increasing intensity.  Note that while sometimes translated as 'less and less', this still represents an 'increasing' (increasingly negative) trend.",
  "etymology": "ますます originates from the iterative use of the verb 増す (masu, to increase).  The repeated form emphasizes the continuous nature of the increase or decrease.",

Consider the specific nuance you wish to convey: a gradual, continuous change (ますます), a sudden increase (どんどん), a proportional relationship (ば〜ほど), or a persistent one-sided trend (一方だ). Choose the word that best reflects the rate and nature of the change."
