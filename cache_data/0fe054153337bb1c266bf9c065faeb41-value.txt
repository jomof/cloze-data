    "writeup": "**ようによっては** is used to express that the outcome or perception of something depends on the manner in which it is done, viewed, or understood.  It combines the noun **よう** (様), meaning “way” or “manner,” with the particle **に**, the て-form of the verb **よる** (依る), meaning “to depend on,” and the particle **は**.  The literal sense is akin to “depending on the way/manner,” and it highlights that different approaches or interpretations can lead to varying results. This grammar point often introduces a conditional element, suggesting that the statement that follows is contingent on the preceding clause.  It's a versatile structure that can apply to actions, perspectives, and interpretations.  You'll often see it used to present alternative viewpoints or possibilities based on differing approaches.",
