  "writeup": "The phrase \"それまでだ (soremade da)\" is a concise and impactful expression conveying a sense of finality or futility.  It literally translates to \"that's as far as it goes,\" but its nuanced meaning depends heavily on context.  Think of it as expressing the idea that if a certain condition is met, all previous efforts become pointless.  It carries a tone of resignation or even desperation, highlighting the irreversibility of the situation.  It's often used when discussing a critical point of no return, where failure eliminates any chance of success.  The structure typically involves a hypothetical condition (often using the \"ば (ba)\" conditional particle) followed by \"それまでだ.\" While the standard form uses \"ば (ba),\"  \"たら (tara)\" can sometimes be used for slightly softer implications. You'll frequently encounter this structure in sentences also containing \"ても (te mo)\" or \"でも (de mo),\" emphasizing the futility even when considering alternative scenarios.  \"と言われればそれまでだ (to iwareba soremade da)\" is a related, idiomatic expression meaning \"If that's what they say, then that's that,\" often used to express polite disagreement or acceptance of an opposing viewpoint, while still hinting at a personal reservation.  Mastering this phrase adds significant depth to your expressive capabilities in Japanese.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Note how the seemingly simple \"それまでだ\" can convey such a range of emotions and situations.  The context, surrounding words, and overall tone significantly impact the precise meaning. Pay close attention to the situation in which you are speaking.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's core components are \"それ (sore)\" meaning \"that\" and \"まで (made)\" meaning \"until.\"  Combined, they suggest a boundary or limit.  The addition of \"だ (da)\" — a copula — asserts the statement as a fact. Therefore, the phrase indicates a definitive point beyond which things cannot proceed."
