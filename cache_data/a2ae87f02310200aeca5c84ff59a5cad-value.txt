    "etymology": "だけで is a combination of だけ (dake - only, just) and で (de - by means of, with). The で particle here indicates the means or method by which something is achieved or occurs.",
    "writeup": "だけで combines the adverbial particle だけ (only, just) and the case-marking particle で (by means of, with). It conveys the idea that \"just by\" doing something, a certain result is achieved or a condition is met. The nuance is often that the action or item specified by だけ is sufficient. だけ highlights that there might have been other options, but only one was chosen.",
