  "writeup": "The grammar structure てはかなわない expresses the feeling of something being unbearable or intolerable.  It combines the te-form of a verb, the particle は, and the negative form of the verb 叶う (kanau), meaning 'to be granted,' 'to come true,' or 'to be possible.'  Think of it as \"It's not bearable when...\" or \"I can't stand it when...\".  The verb following て often appears in a passive form, suggesting the speaker is unwillingly subjected to the action. However, this isn't strictly necessary.  The structure can also follow the conjunctive form of い-adjectives or appear as ではかなわない after な-adjectives.  **Important:**  Do not confuse 叶う (kanau) with 敵う (kanau), which means 'to be a match for.' They have distinct grammatical uses.",
  "etymology": "The core of this grammar point lies in the verb 叶う (kanau), meaning 'to be fulfilled' or 'to come true.'  In this context, the negative form, かなわない (kanawanai), implies a state of unfulfillment or unbearable frustration. The て-form connects the preceding action to this feeling of intolerability, while は emphasizes that specific action as the source of the problem.",
