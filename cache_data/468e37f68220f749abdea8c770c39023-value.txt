  "writeup": "The phrase \"なかなか～ない\" expresses a sense of difficulty, reluctance, or unlikeliness concerning the action described by the verb.  It conveys that something is 'not really' happening, or 'hardly' happening, emphasizing a deficiency or delay. Unlike a simple negative, なかなか adds a nuance of expectation or desire that the action *should* be happening.  It often implies frustration or disappointment that the expected outcome isn't being realized.  The structure is straightforward: なかなか precedes the negative form of a verb.  The positive form of なかなか means 'quite', 'very', or 'considerably', demonstrating the interesting contrast in meaning. The kanji form, 中々, literally means 'middle', middle ground, which hints at the expression's meaning - something isn't reaching the ideal 'middle' position that leads to the desired result. ",
  "etymology": "The word なかなか (nakaka) originates from the kanji 中々 (nakaka), meaning 'middle' or 'in the midst of'.  The use of 'middle' here creates a connotation of something not quite reaching the ideal point of completion or progress.  The negative following it conveys the failure to reach this ideal state.",
