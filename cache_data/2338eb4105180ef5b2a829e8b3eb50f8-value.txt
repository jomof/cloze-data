    "etymology": "「だから」 (dakara) means \"therefore\" or \"so\". 「と」 (to) is a particle indicating a conditional or quotative meaning. 「言って」 (itte) is the te-form of 「言う」 (iu), meaning \"to say\". Together, 「だからと言って」 literally translates to \"even if you say 'therefore'\".",
    "writeup": "「だからと言って」 (dakara to itte) is a conjunction used to express that even if a certain premise or situation is true, the expected conclusion does not necessarily follow. It's similar to saying \"just because... doesn't mean...\" or \"even so\". It often precedes a statement that contrasts with what might be expected based on the initial premise. The phrase can be used to introduce a contrasting opinion or to correct a potential misunderstanding.",
