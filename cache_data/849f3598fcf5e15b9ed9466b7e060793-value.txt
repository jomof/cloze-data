  "writeup": "The u-verb やる (yaru), occasionally seen in the kanji form 遣る, primarily means ‘to do’ but can also mean ‘to give,’ acting as a more casual form of あげる (ageru).  When attached to the te-form of verbs, it functions as a subsidiary verb.  Crucially, using ～てやる carries a strong implication of the speaker's superiority or authority over the recipient of the action.  This nuance is crucial; it's not simply 'to do for someone.'  It suggests the speaker is doing something *because* they are in a position to do it, often implying the recipient is incapable or unwilling.  This can sound patronizing.  In other contexts, やる functions similarly to 見せる (miseru, ‘to show’), emphasizing the speaker's resolute intention to perform the action.  In these cases, it translates better as “I will do (A), just wait and see,” or “I’ll definitely do (A).”  However, regardless of the specific translation, the underlying meaning always emphasizes the speaker’s agency and potential superiority.",
  "etymology": "The verb やる (yaru) has a complex etymology, tracing back to Proto-Japonic roots associated with giving or doing.  Its usage with the て-form is a later development, reflecting a shift in emphasis from simple action to an action undertaken with a sense of superiority or determination.",

    {
      "japanese": "心配しないで、私が**やってやる**から。",
      "english": "Don't worry, I'll take care of it.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "supportive",
      "conjugation": "て-form + やる",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「私が」 establishes the speaker's agency, subtly hinting at a willingness to assist. The phrase 「やってやる」emphasizes the speaker's capability and willingness to handle the task independently, conveying a sense of assurance without being overly assertive."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "今夜は私がおごって**やる**から、好きなもの頼んでいいよ。",
      "english": "I'll treat you tonight, order whatever you like.",
      "register": "teineigo",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "て-form + やる",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「おごってやる」is used, making it sound like a generous offer. However, the inherent nuance of 「てやる」suggests a playful hint of control or dominance in the relationship, making it flirty."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "私が代わりに**やってやる**よ。",
      "english": "I'll do it for you.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": "て-form + やる",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「私が」 instead of 「俺が」 which makes it slightly more polite despite using the casual conjugation. 「やってやる」 shows the speaker's readiness to help, but might be perceived as slightly condescending if the listener doesn't need the help."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "絶対、成功して**やる**！",
      "english": "I'll definitely succeed!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "optimistic",
      "conjugation": "て-form + やる",
      "nuance": "The plain form 「してやる」 is appropriate for expressing strong determination in a casual context. The strong resolve is shown in 「絶対」."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの野郎、今度あったらぶっ飛ばして**やる**！",
      "english": "That bastard, next time I see him, I'll beat him up!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "angry",
      "conjugation": "て-form + やる",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The rough and tough phrasing 「あの野郎」 and 「ぶっ飛ばしてやる」 are typical of male speech and demonstrate anger.  The use of 「やる」 intensifies the threat."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "見ててよ、私がきっとうまく**やってやる**から。",
      "english": "Watch me, I'll make sure to do it well.",

      "setting": "persuasive",
      "conjugation": "て-form + やる",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The combination of 「見ててよ」 and 「やってやる」 implies a challenge and confidence. The speaker is almost showing off to the male listener, and 「私が」 further highlights her agency."

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the key to mastering ～てやる lies in understanding the subtle power dynamics it conveys. While it can express determination, it often carries a subtext of superiority or even condescension. Choose this construction carefully, considering your relationship with the listener.",
