    "etymology": "The particle 「から」 originally meant \"from\" and indicates a starting point. When used to express \"because,\" it indicates that something follows as a natural consequence from a certain starting point or reason.",
    "writeup": "「から」indicates a reason or cause. It translates to \"because\" or \"since\" in English. The basic structure is \"(Reason) から (Result).\" When 「から」 follows a noun or a な-adjective, it requires 「だ」 before it. For example, you would say 「雨だから」 (because it's raining) or 「学生だから」 (because I'm a student). 「から」is a case marking particle, indicating the relationship between the reason and the result. Unlike 「ので」, 「から」 can sometimes sound a bit direct, so consider your audience.",
