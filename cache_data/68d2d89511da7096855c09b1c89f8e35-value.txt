    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed from で, the case marker, and よければ, the conditional (ba-form) of the い-adjective いい (good). The で here indicates the means or condition by which something is acceptable.",
    "writeup": "でよければ is an expression constructed with the case-marking particle で and the conditional form (ば form) of the い-adjective いい (good), よければ. Its literal meaning, “if (A) is good/fine with,” is quite similar to its standard translation: \"if (A) is okay.\" でよければ always follows nouns or noun phrases.\n\nThis phrase is often used in relation to oneself, in order to politely offer some sort of help, advice, or service. As で is used in its standard meaning of “with” or “by,” でよければ implies that the speaker is inquiring whether the quality/ability of A is good enough to achieve some specific result.",
