  "pronunciation": {
    "katakana": "がる",

  "writeup": "がる is an u-verb suffix primarily used to express the appearance of a feeling or state, rather than the feeling itself.  It's attached to the stem of an い-adjective (remove the い) or a な-adjective (omit the な).  Crucially, がる describes *how someone seems to be acting*, not necessarily their internal emotional state.  This is a key difference in Japanese communication—you wouldn't usually comment directly on another person's feelings unless explicitly told. がる allows you to express your inference based on observed behavior. For example, seeing someone shiver suggests coldness, but you wouldn't say \"He *is* cold,\" unless he said it himself. Instead, you'd use がる to say he \"seems cold\" or \"appears to be cold.\"  The difference between がる and がっている is subtle: がる suggests a habitual or typical behavior, while がっている focuses on a specific moment.  Interestingly, using がっている for momentary states is becoming less common, with そう often replacing it.  Note that がる can also be used self-referentially in the third person, expressing a perceived self-image or an assumed perception by others.  This adds a layer of nuance to the expression.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of がる is complex and not definitively traced to a single origin.  However, scholars suggest a possible link to verbs expressing involuntary actions or states, reflecting its use in conveying an impression rather than a direct statement of feeling.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "彼はいつも女の子の前では強がる **がった** けど友達の中では彼は一番の怖がりだ。",
      "english": "He always acted tough in front of girls, but amongst friends he's the biggest scaredy-cat.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "plain past",
      "nuance": "The use of 「がった」 (past tense) shows that the speaker is referring to a past behavior of the subject, which is then contrasted to his current behaviour among friends. The sentence is casually descriptive and is generally applicable to many social settings."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "犬が嫌がることをしてはいけない。",
      "english": "You mustn't do anything that the dog dislikes.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The use of 「はいけない」 makes this sentence quite direct and formal.  The context is instructional. The sentence uses plain form of がる, because the dog's usual behaviour is being described."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "トムはこの新しいゲームを欲しがるだろう。",
      "english": "Tom will probably want this new game.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "nuance": "The use of 「だろう」 makes the sentence less direct and gives the statement the quality of conjecture or inference. This is a semi-formal way to state the thought of someone else wanting a game, and could be used in a variety of settings. The plain form of がる emphasizes Tom's likely behaviour."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの人は寒がっている。マフラーをしてあげたらどう？",
      "english": "That person looks cold. Why don't you offer them your scarf?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "nuance": "「がっている」 suggests an ongoing action.  The overall tone is friendly and slightly suggestive, suitable for a casual conversation. The use of がっている emphasizes the speaker's immediate observation of how the other person seems to be acting. "
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この子はいつも新しいおもちゃを欲しがる。困ったものだ。",
      "english": "This child always wants new toys. It's a real problem.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "melancholic",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The 「いつも」 emphasizes a habit. The sentence shows how the speaker is expressing their feelings about a child's behavior. The use of がる shows how the child 'appears to be acting'."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ねえ、私と二人きりになりたい？ちょっと…ドキドキする？",
      "english": "Hey, do you want to be alone with me?  A little…excited?",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「ねえ」 and 「ちょっと…ドキドキする？」 creates a flirty and intimate tone. The question about wanting to be alone is used as a prelude to an indirect expression of affection. The plain form of 「がる」 is natural for intimacy in casual settings."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "君の笑顔を見ると、心が温かくなるような気がするんだ。",
      "english": "When I see your smile, I feel like my heart gets warm.",

      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses 「ような気がする」 to express a feeling indirectly.  It is a softer, more romantic way to confess how the speaker is affected by the other person.  The use of plain non-past form of がる is appropriate for the semi-formal tone."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the nuance of がる lies in its ability to convey observed behavior interpreted as an indication of an underlying emotion or state. The choice of tense, politeness level, and other particles significantly impacts the overall impression.",

      "meaning": "To want something; to be in need of",

  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, carefully consider the context.  If you're expressing a direct desire or making a request, use たい, がほしい, or てほしい.  If you're inferring someone's feelings based on their behavior, use がる. Remember that たがる is essentially たい + がる."
