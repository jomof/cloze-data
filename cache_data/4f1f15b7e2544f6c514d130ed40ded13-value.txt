  "writeup": "のなんのって is a casual phrase used in spoken Japanese to emphasize the degree of something.  It translates roughly to \"so much that...,\" \"extremely...,\" or \"very...\"  The structure uses the particle の, the phrase 何の (nani no, 'what kind of'), and って (tte, a contraction of という, 'to say').  It's essentially a casual way of saying something is so extreme that it's beyond description.  This phrase follows i-adjectives, na-adjectives (with な), and verbs.  The nuances are subtle and depend heavily on context. Think of it as expressing such a high degree that you're almost at a loss for words to describe it. This intensifying expression adds a conversational and often emphatic tone to your speech.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's components are straightforward: の (no) is a possessive particle, 何の (nani no) means 'what kind of,' and って (tte) is a colloquial shortening of という (to iu), meaning 'to say.' The combination creates a sense of incredulity or astonishment at the extremity of the preceding descriptor.",
