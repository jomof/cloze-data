  "writeup": "ずにはすまない is used to indicate that one ‘has no choice but to (A)’, or ‘won’t get away without doing (A)’. It's a formal expression combining the negative classical auxiliary verb, ず, the case-marking particle に, the adverbial particle は, and the standard negated form of the う-verb 済む ‘to come to pass’, or ‘to finish’.  Therefore, a more literal translation is ‘it will not come to pass that (A) is not done’, though the more natural English interpretations convey the same meaning.  Because this expression begins with ず, it exclusively follows verbs.  As with other instances where ず is used with する, ぜず is the correct conjugation pattern.  The standard (ない) negative form of a verb may also be followed by ではすまない, with the same meaning as ずにはすまない.  \n\n**Caution:** This construction sounds unnatural when the speaker's need for (A) is based solely on personal feelings. (A) is usually something expected by anyone.",

      "nuance": "The use of ねえ、あのね creates a very intimate and casual tone.

  "post_example_writeup": "While ずにはすまない is grammatically correct and understandable, it's less frequently used in daily conversation compared to other alternatives like ざるを得ない or ないわけにはいかない.  These latter expressions convey the same essential meaning with greater naturalness in most situations.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of ずにはすまない lies in the combination of several historical grammatical elements.  ず is a negative form derived from the classical negative auxiliary verb ず,  に indicates the conditional or causative marker in this instance, は functions as the topic marker, and すまない is the negative form of the verb 済む (sumu), meaning 'to be completed' or 'to be finished'.  The overall effect creates a sense of unavoidable necessity, almost a fate of the action taking place.",
