    "etymology": "The kanji 代 (dai) originally meant 'generation' or 'era.' Its use in this context extends to representing periods in someone's life (decades of age) or periods in history (decades of time).",
    "writeup": "The suffix ～代 (dai) is used for several different purposes. One of the most common is to indicate someone's decade of age, similar to how English uses \"teens,\" \"twenties,\" and \"thirties.\" You simply add 代 after the age number (in tens). For example, 十代 (jūdai) means \"teens.\"\n\nIn addition to age, ～代 can express a chronological decade, such as the 1960s, 70s, or 80s. In these cases, 年代 (nendai) is often used after the decade. For example, 70年代 (nanajū nendai) means \"the 70s.\"\n\nImportant Note: 代 can also mark eras of time or generations within a specific family or political position, but this usage is less common at the N4 level.",
