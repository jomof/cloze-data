    "etymology": "The adjective 「いい」 originates from the older Japanese word 「良し (よし)」, which also means 'good.' Over time, 「よし」 evolved into 「いい」. The kanji 「良い」 is still used, but it's often read as 「よい」, which sounds more formal or old-fashioned. The modern reading 「いい」 is more common in everyday conversation.",
    "writeup": "「いい」 is an *i*-adjective in Japanese, signifying 'good'. Its conjugation is irregular and deviates from the standard pattern of other *i*-adjectives. A key characteristic is the change of its initial `い` to `よ` depending on the conjugated form. This phenomenon is unique to `いい` and is crucial for its accurate usage. While it can be written with the kanji 「良い」, it is typically read as 「よい」 in such instances, which carries a more formal or antiquated nuance. In daily conversation, 「いい」 is overwhelmingly more common.",
