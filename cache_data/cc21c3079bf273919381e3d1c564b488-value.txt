  "writeup": "どころか (dokoro ka) is a fascinating particle phrase that expresses a strong negation of the preceding statement while emphasizing a contrasting, often more significant, subsequent point.  It's built from two components: ところ (tokoro), meaning 'place' or 'point,' and か (ka), a sentence-final particle that can indicate a question or doubt.  The transformation of ところ to どころ (dokoro) reflects a common phonological change seen when ところ is used in a negative context.  While often translated as 'far from,' 'let alone,' or 'anything but,' どころか's function is to create a dramatic contrast, highlighting the unexpected or surprising reality.  It's versatile and can be used with various word forms, including the attributive form of adjectives, the stem form of na-adjectives, and directly attached to nouns. Remember that any sentence using どころか requires a second part (B) that significantly outweighs part (A) in the speaker's judgment.  This creates a strong emphasis and conveys a sense of unexpected contrast.  The structure emphasizes the speaker's perspective on the situation. ",
  "etymology": "The etymology of どころか lies in its components. ところ (tokoro) originates from the ancient word 所 (also tokoro), meaning 'place' or 'point.' Over time, it developed various nuanced meanings, including a sense of circumstance or situation. The particle か (ka) is versatile and has several functions, including indicating a question, doubt, or emphasis. In the context of どころか, the か contributes to the expression's overall sense of contrast and surprise, transforming the statement from a simple observation to an emphatic refutation. The sound change from ところ to どころ is common in such negative contexts, reflecting historical sound changes in the language.",
