    "etymology": "The particle 「し」 is thought to have originated from the verb 「す」 (to do). It evolved to indicate the listing of items or reasons, emphasizing that they coexist without contradiction.",
    "writeup": "Similar to 「て」, 「し」 is a conjunction particle used to link parts of a sentence (A and B) and describe the connection. 「し」 emphasizes **reasons**. It is often translated as \"and.\" 「し」 can be connected to almost any word, but requires a 「だ」 before it when following nouns or な-adjectives. 「し」 follows each listed reason. The final 「し」 can be replaced with 「から」 or 「ので」 before stating the result. Using 「し」 indicates that each reason has equal weight. Therefore, it's unsuitable when one reason significantly outweighs others. 「し」 indicates things that 「矛盾無く共存する」 (\"coexist without contradicting each other\"). This is why each item listed must be of equal importance to the speaker.",
