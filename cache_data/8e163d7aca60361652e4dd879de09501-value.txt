  "writeup": "につれて, or に連れて when using kanji, is an expression that may be translated as 'as (A), then (B)', or 'in proportion to (A), (B)'.  It's formed using the case-marking particle に, the verb 連れる (reneru) 'to take along,' and the conjunction particle て. Literally, it's similar to 'being taken along with (A), (B),' or 'in tow with (A), (B).'  につれて follows the plain, non-past form of verbs or nouns.  Because 連れる is a transitive verb, (A)につれて(B) implies (A) causes (B) simultaneously. This doesn't require (A) to be intentional; it's a domino effect where (A) instigates (B).",
  "etymology": "The grammar point's core, 連れる (reneru), means 'to take along' or 'to lead.' The て-form creates a continuous or consequential sense, showing a simultaneous or directly resulting action.",
