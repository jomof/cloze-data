    "etymology": "This grammar point uses the particle 「と」, which marks a quote, combined with the verb 「言う」 (iu, to say). Essentially, it's like saying \"everything that can be called 'X'.\" The repetition emphasizes the totality or the exceptional nature of the noun.",
    "writeup": "One use of the common 「という」 structure is pairing identical nouns to convey \"every single (A)\" or \"each and every (A).\" While often used for emphasis, it literally means \"every (B) that could be called an (A).\" 「という」 is placed between the same noun repeated. When used with abstract nouns like 「今日」 (today), it often means \"(A) of all (A)s,\" implying this particular one is special. The special quality is usually described next in the sentence.",
