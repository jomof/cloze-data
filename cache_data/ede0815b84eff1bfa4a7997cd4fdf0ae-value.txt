    "etymology": "だろう is derived from the plain form of the copula, だ, combined with the auxiliary verb of conjecture, ろう. Thus, it inherently carries a sense of supposition or uncertainty.",
    "writeup": "だろう is a conjugated form of だ and can be seen in the contracted form だろ (more casual). だろう expresses the speaker's thought that something is true (assertion/expectation), and that the listener probably agrees with them. This translates to \"right?\" or \"probably\" in English.\n\nだろう carries the same meaning as でしょう (the polite equivalent). However, because だ is more casual than です, だろう is considered more casual/masculine than でしょう. It's important to note that while だろう is often used with supporting information, it can be used when the speaker \"feels\" something is true. In this case, だろう indicates low confidence, often conveyed through tone of voice.",
