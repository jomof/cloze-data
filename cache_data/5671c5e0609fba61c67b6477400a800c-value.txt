    "etymology": "The grammar point 「つもりで」 is derived from 「つもり」, which means 'intention' or 'plan,' combined with the particle 「で」, indicating the means or manner in which something is done. Thus, it conveys the idea of acting in accordance with a certain intention or mindset.",
    "writeup": "「つもりで」 combines the noun 「つもり」 (intention) with the particle 「で」 (with). This structure is used in several ways, depending on what precedes it.\n\nWhen combined with verbs, な-adjectives, or nouns in their plain forms, it implies that action B is being done with the intention of A. As 「つもり」 is a noun, use 「の」 before it when grouped with other nouns, and use 「な」 when linked to な-adjectives.\n\nWhen paired with verbs in the past form, 「つもりで」 implies that the speaker is \"acting as though A,\" \"pretending that A,\" or \"is convinced that A.\" This meaning comes from the intention being contrary to what is actually true.",
