    "etymology": "いわゆる is a combination of いわ, a modern variant of いは, the indeterminate form of 言う (iu) \"to say\", and ゆる, which is the classical literary equivalent of the auxiliary verb れる (reru), the displacement verb indicator in its attributive form. The kanji for 謂 means \"oral tradition,\" highlighting how something is referred to over time or in different places.",
    "writeup": "いわゆる, occasionally written as 所謂 in kanji, is used before nouns to indicate that something is \"what is called (A),\" \"the so-called (A),\" or \"generally known as (A).\" It literally means \"what is said to be (A)\". It's a useful phrase to introduce a common term or concept.",
