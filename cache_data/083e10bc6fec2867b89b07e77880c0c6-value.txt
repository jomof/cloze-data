  "writeup": "つ is a slang abbreviation stemming from という, meaning 'called (A)', 'that (A) was said', or 'known as (A)'. It essentially quotes something previously stated.  You'll also see it as っつ or even つう.  Remember, という combines the quotation particle と and the verb 言う (iu) meaning 'to say'. Because と is the quotation particle, つ can follow virtually any word type.  While strong slang, it's remarkably common. Native speakers frequently abbreviate という, with つ being the ultimate abbreviation. The pause in っつ might suggest annoyance or impatience, but not always.  Important Consideration: While 言う disappears in つ, standard conjugation rules remain. To express past tense ('was said') or progressive ('is being said'), use forms like つった or つってん respectively.  The ている  contraction to てん is explained further in the ん slang lesson. This slang is used across all genders and age groups, but is more common in informal settings.",
  "etymology": "The slang form \"つ\" is a shortened form of the phrase \"という (to iu)\", which literally means \"to say that.\"  The \"と (to)\" part functions as a quotation marker, while \"いう (iu)\" is the verb \"to say.\" Over time, the \"いう\" was dropped in casual speech, leaving only the \"つ (tsu)\" to represent the quotation.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "おい、今**なんつった**？",
      "english": "Oi, what'd you just say?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "casual",
      "conjugation": "plain past",
      "nuance": "The use of \"おい (oi)\" and the shortened form \"なんつった (nan-tutta)\" creates a very casual and almost aggressive tone.  The abrupt nature of 「おい」 adds intensity."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あいつ、**なんつってん**の？",
      "english": "What's that guy saying?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "casual",
      "conjugation": "plain progressive",
      "nuance": "The use of \"あいつ (aitsu)\" shows a lack of respect. 「なんつってんの (nan-tten-no)?」 is already slang, and adding の makes it more casual and questioning."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼、**っつった**けど、本当かな？",
      "english": "He said that, but is it true?",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "casual",
      "conjugation": "polite non-past",
      "nuance": "While using the polite form 「っつった (tutta)」 it's still informal because of the context. Adding 「けど (kedo)」 gives a sense of doubt, keeping the tone light."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼女が「好きだよ」**つった**。",
      "english": "She said, \"I like you.\"",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "plain past",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The sentence is very casual and straightforward, suitable for close friends.  The use of 「つった (tutta)」 enhances the intimate and playful tone of a confession.  The 「彼女 (kanojo)」 demonstrates a clear relationship."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの人、**つう**人、知ってる？",
      "english": "Do you know that person, the one they call...",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "polite non-past",
      "nuance": "The casual tone is set by the use of 「あの人 (ano hito)」 and the slang 「つう (tsū)」.  This slang creates a relaxed conversation tone.  The use of 「人 (hito)」 is very generic."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "昨日、彼に「明日会おう」**つって**約束したんだ。",
      "english": "I promised him yesterday, saying 'Let's meet tomorrow'.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "storytelling",
      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "nuance": "The casual nature is emphasized through the use of the past tense 「約束したんだ (yakusoku shita-nda)」 combined with the slang form.  The informal nature is strengthened by using 「彼 (kare)」. The sentence implies a close relationship."
    }

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the key to using つ effectively is understanding the context.  It's informal, so avoid it in formal situations.  The nuances of intonation and word choice significantly impact the overall feel of the sentence.",
