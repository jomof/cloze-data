  "etymology": "The grammar point 「～くもなんともない」 combines the adverbial form of an い-adjective (～く), the particle 「も」 (which adds emphasis), and 「なんともない」, meaning \"it's nothing\" or \"not at all.\" The addition of 「も」 to 「なんともない」 amplifies the negation, creating a stronger sense of denial or lack of feeling.",
  "writeup": "The grammar point 「い-Adjective[く]もなんともない」 expresses that something is \"not at all\" or \"not in any way.\" It emphasizes the negation of a particular quality or feeling. It's formed by combining the adverbial form of an い-adjective (～く), the particle 「も」 (for emphasis), and 「なんともない」 (meaning \"it's nothing\").\n\n*   It is used to express that something doesn't reach a certain extent or level of impact. It implies that a potential issue or concern is simply not significant.\n\n*   It is frequently used with adjectives that describe sensations or emotions.\n\n*   It's also commonly used with the auxiliary adjective 「たい」 to express that someone \"doesn't want to do\" something at all. This structure is often used when the speaker wishes to strongly deny any desire or inclination towards something.",
