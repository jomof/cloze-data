    "writeup": "The grammar point 「あながち〜ない」 expresses that something is **not necessarily** the case or true. It implies that while there might be a general belief or expectation, there are exceptions or uncertainties. It's often used to soften a statement or to indicate that the speaker doesn't completely agree with a prevailing opinion. It has a formal tone, and can be used in writing or in formal speech.",
    "etymology": "The term 「あながち」 is thought to be derived from 「強ち (あながち)」, which meant \"forcefully\" or \"unreasonably.\" Over time, its meaning evolved to imply a degree of uncertainty or reservation, often used in conjunction with negative forms to express that something is \"not necessarily\" the case.",
