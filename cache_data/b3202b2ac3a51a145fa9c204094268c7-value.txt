  "writeup": "The grammar particles に関する (ni kansuru) and に関して (ni kan shite) are used to express the topic or subject matter of a sentence.  They both translate to \"regarding,\" \"about,\" or \"concerning.\"  The key difference lies in their stylistic nuance.  に関する (ni kansuru) directly follows the topic, while に関して (ni kan shite) allows for a brief pause before elaborating on the topic.  Think of it like the difference between a concise summary and a more detailed explanation.  Both are standard register and widely used.  While both can function similarly, に関して often lends a slightly more formal tone to the sentence compared to に関する.  This subtle difference is often important in maintaining an appropriate level of formality in various contexts.  Consider the context and your intended level of formality when choosing between the two.",
  "etymology": "The core of both particles is the verb 関する (kansuru), meaning \"to relate to\" or \"to concern.\"  The particle に (ni) indicates the topic or subject of the relationship.  に関して adds the particle に (ni) and the te-form of the verb 関する (kansuru), which is 関して (kan shite).  Therefore, both forms are grammatically linked to the verb's meaning.",
