  "etymology": "The grammar point 「じゃない」 is a contraction of 「ではない」. 「では」 is the topic marker 「は」 attached to 「で」, which is the te-form of the copula 「だ」 (to be). 「ない」 is the negative auxiliary verb.",
  "writeup": "「じゃない」 is the casual form of 「ではない」. 「では」 is often contracted to 「じゃ」 in Japanese. 「じゃない」 (casual) or 「ではない」 (semi-polite) are used to create the negative form of nouns and な-adjectives. These structures are simply added to the base form of the noun or な-adjective. 「じゃ」 and 「では」 can also be used with the negative ます form of 「ある」, to create the polite variant.\n\n「ない」 is sometimes said or written as 「ね」 or 「ねえ」, but this is considered very casual, even a bit rough, and should be avoided in most conversations.\n\n「じゃない」 is also frequently used to ask questions, much like 「じゃないか」. However, 「じゃない」 as a question is a little more blunt, like \"isn't it?\" in English, while 「じゃないか」 is closer to \"don't you think?\". When 「じゃない」 is used as a question, it is usually obvious from the rising intonation.",
