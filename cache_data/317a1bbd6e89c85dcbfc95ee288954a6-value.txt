    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ている」 is formed by combining the te-form of a verb with the auxiliary verb 「いる」. 「いる」 originally means \"to exist (animate)\". When used with the te-form, it indicates a continuing state or action. In the case of habitual actions, it describes a state of regularly doing something, almost as if the action continuously exists in one's routine.",
    "writeup": "The 「ている」 form, when used to express habitual actions, indicates the repetition of common activities. It describes actions that aren't necessarily 'continuing' at the moment of speaking but occur so frequently that they're considered routine.  Because 「いる」 is one of the verbs for 'existing' in Japanese, 「ている」 is closer to 'continuing to exist in a specific state', rather than simply \"-ing\" in English.\n\nIn this construction, it can be thought of as 'to be existing in the state of performing a regular activity'. To enhance clarity, time expressions like 「毎日」 (every day), 「毎晩」 (every night), and 「毎週」 (every week) are often used.\n\n**Important Consideration**:\n\n*   In informal speech, 「ている」 may be shortened to 「てる」. Be mindful of this contraction in casual conversation. For example, 「見ている」 becomes 「見てる」.",
