    "etymology": "The grammar point 「がほしい」 is derived from the adjective 「欲しい」 (hoshii), which means \"wanted\" or \"desired.\" The 「が」 particle marks the object of desire.",
    "writeup": "The 「がほしい」 grammar point is used to express a desire for a **thing**. 「欲しい」 (hoshii) is an *i*-adjective, so it conjugates like one.\n\nIt's essential to remember that this construction is only for expressing a desire for *things* (nouns). When you want to express a desire to *do* something (verbs), you'll need to use the 「〜たい」 form. This grammar point is typically used to talk about your own desires, not other peoples'. To talk about other people's desires, use 「〜たがる」. Please refer to the 「〜たがる」 lesson for more information.",
