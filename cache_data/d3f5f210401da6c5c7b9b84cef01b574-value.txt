    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the te-form of a verb with the particle 「は」, emphasizing the repetition or alternation of the verb's action. The 「は」 particle here indicates contrast or emphasis on each repeated action, which contributes to the overall meaning of continuous repetition.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「ては〜ては」 highlights that actions (A) and (B) are continuously being repeated. It can be interpreted as \"doing (A) and (B) repeatedly.\" Often, actions (A) and (B) will contrast each other, such as starting and stopping, walking and running, or going forwards and then backwards.\n\n「ては〜ては」 is used with verbs in the te-form, so it may occasionally appear as 「では」. Abbreviated versions, 「ちゃ」 and 「じゃ」, may also be seen, but it's often more natural if the same abbreviation is used both times, maintaining consistent formality within the sentence.\n\n**Important Consideration:** 「ては」 may sometimes appear only once, without changing the meaning of repetition, particularly when the rest of the sentence implies repeated action.",
