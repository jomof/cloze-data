    "etymology": "The particle に typically indicates a location, time, or direction towards which something is moving or happening. In this context, it's used to mark the time period within which an action occurs with a certain frequency, essentially defining the scope or container for that frequency.",
    "writeup": "The particle に, when indicating frequency, specifies how often an action occurs within a given time period. The structure is: [Time Period] に [Number of Times] [Verb]. Think of に as marking the \"goal\" or \"destination\" within which something takes place.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nDo not confuse this usage of に with で in relation to time. で expresses the amount of time required to complete an action, not its frequency. に marks a portion of time within a larger timeframe, while で marks the entire duration of an action.",
