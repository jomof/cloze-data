  "writeup": "ならまだしも is a nuanced expression combining なら ('if'), まだ ('still'), and the adverbial particle しも.  This particle, primarily from classical Japanese, serves to emphatically strengthen the preceding word. The overall meaning conveys a contrast: 'A is acceptable, but B is not.'  Or, more subtly, 'If it were A, it would be tolerable, but B is a different story.'  The structure typically divides a sentence into two parts, with ならまだしも attaching to the end of the first (acceptable) part.  It's important to note that しも's influence on まだ leads to a deeper meaning akin to 'If it's A, then there's still that element, but regarding B...'.  While しも is rarely used in modern Japanese outside set phrases like ならまだしも, 今しも ('right this moment'), and だれしも ('absolutely anybody'), its presence here highlights a subtle but significant contrast.  Mastering ならまだしも requires understanding this delicate balance between acceptance and rejection.",
