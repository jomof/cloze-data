    "writeup": "**折角（せっかく)** is an idiomatic adverb that is often used to express doing something \"with trouble\", \"at great pains\", or that something is a \"rare\" or \"long-awaited occasion\". As an adverb that often modifies the meaning of a whole sentence, it commonly appears at the beginning of a statement. When 折角 is used to indicate that an event is long-awaited, it appears directly before the event, typically followed by the particle の.

**Etymology:** There are several theories about the origin of 折角. One common explanation is that it's an abbreviation of **頭巾の角を折る (ずきんのつのおおる)**, meaning \"to fold the horn (or tail) of a hood\". This refers to a practice by a famous Confucian scholar who intentionally folded his hood to prevent it from getting wet in the rain.  People at the time started imitating this action, and 折角 came to mean \"intentionally\" or \"to go out of one's way to do something\".",
