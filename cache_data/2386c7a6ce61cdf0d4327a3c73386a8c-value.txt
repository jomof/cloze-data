    "writeup": "のは functions to nominalize a phrase, effectively turning it into a noun. This allows you to emphasize a particular action, state, or quality as the subject of the sentence. It's similar to using \"that\" or \"what\" in English to create noun clauses. For example, \"食べるのは楽しい (taberu no wa tanoshii)\" translates to \"Eating is fun,\" where \"eating\" is the emphasized subject. のは can be used with verbs and adjectives in their plain form, across various tenses. However, it is not used with polite forms like ます or ません, nor can it be directly followed by だ, である, or です, as this would shift the meaning to the explanatory ～んです or のです.",
