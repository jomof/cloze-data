    "etymology": "けど is a contraction of けれども. だけど is formed by adding the copula だ to けど. Both convey a similar meaning of concession or contrast, but with a casual nuance.",
    "writeup": "**けど** and **だけど** are conjunctive particles in Japanese, similar in function to **が**, used to connect two clauses where there is a sense of contrast or concession. Think of it as expressing \"while thinking about (A), (B)\", often translating to \"but\" or \"however\" in English.  **けど** is a more casual alternative to **が** and is a modern abbreviation of **けれども**.  **だけど** is simply **けど** with the copula **だ** attached, commonly used after nouns or な-adjectives. Here's a spectrum of formality, from most casual to formal: けど → けども → けれど → けれども → が.  It's **important** to note that the latter part of the sentence after **けど** is sometimes omitted if it's obvious from the context or if the speaker chooses not to explicitly state it.",

For slightly more formal settings or writing, **が** or **けれども** might be more appropriate.  **だが** and **ですが** are best reserved for even more formal contexts.  **ところが** is unique in that it emphasizes an unexpected outcome, so it's not a direct substitute for **けど** in most cases."
