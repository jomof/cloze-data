    "etymology": "い-adjectives are named so because they always end with the hiragana 「い」. This 「い」 is part of the adjective's dictionary form and does not change, unlike な-adjectives, when modifying a noun.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, nouns can be modified to describe their qualities using い-adjectives. Unlike な-adjectives, い-adjectives are attached directly to the noun without needing な. It's **important** to remember that the final 「い」 is a part of the adjective; you don't remove it. For example, 「新しい車」 (atarashii kuruma) means \"a new car.\" The い-adjective 「新しい」 (atarashii) directly modifies the noun 「車」 (kuruma). \n\n When trying to identify い-adjectives, an important (but not foolproof) rule is that they will always have the い outside of any kanji in the word. For example, in 「面白い」 (omoshiroi - interesting), the い is outside the kanji, so it's an い-adjective. However, 「綺麗」 (kirei - clean) has the い inside the kanji, so it is a な-adjective. Less than 1% of adjectives with い outside the kanji are な-adjectives, such as 「嫌い」 (kirai - hate), which is a な-adjective.",
