    "etymology": "The word 「いきなり」 comes from 「行き成り」, which literally means 「the state of going directly to something」. Although the kanji form is rarely used now, it helps to understand the nuance of a sudden and unexpected unfolding of a situation.",
    "writeup": "いきなり is an adverb that means \"suddenly,\" \"all of a sudden,\" or \"for no reason.\" It describes something that happens abruptly, without any prior warning. It's usually written in hiragana. As an adverb, it typically appears at the beginning of sentences or directly before the verb it modifies. Though it often simply means 「suddenly」, it carries a nuance similar to the English phrase \"a sudden turn of events,\" emphasizing the abrupt or unexpected development of a situation.",
