    "etymology": "The grammar point 「やすい」 comes from the adjective 「易い」 (yasui), which means 'easy' or 'simple'. When attached to the ます-stem of a verb, it transforms the verb into an adjective-like phrase indicating that the action is easy to perform.",
    "writeup": "「やすい」 is an い-adjective that attaches to the ます-stem of verbs. This expresses that something is \"easy to do.\" For example, 食べやすい (tabe yasui) means \"easy to eat.\" Sometimes, it can also mean \"prone to (A),\" or \"likely to (A)\" when the verb relates to emotions.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Be careful not to confuse this 「易い」 with 「安い」 (yasui), which means \"cheap.\" They are written with different kanji, but the 「やすい」 form is typically written in hiragana. Using 「安い」 with verbs to mean \"easy\" is incorrect.\n*   While 「易い」 is an い-adjective, it's usually attached to verbs, and you would use 「簡単」(kantan) to say something is \"easy\" in other contexts.",
