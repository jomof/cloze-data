  "writeup": "In Japanese, い-adjectives, or *i-keiyoushi* (イ形容詞), are a crucial part of speech used to describe nouns.  They're called \"form containing words\" and all end in い in their base form.  However, it's **crucial** to remember that not all words ending in い are い-adjectives.  Many learners initially struggle to distinguish them. For example,  words like きらい ('dislike') and きれい ('clean, beautiful') are often confused. きれい is derived from the kanji 綺麗, with い an inherent part of the kanji. This is never the case with い-adjectives; the い is always a separate ending morpheme. Because the kanji for 綺麗 is relatively complex, きれい is frequently written in hiragana or katakana, further contributing to this confusion.  Unfortunately, there's no single grammatical rule to identify every non-い-adjective ending in い. However, with sufficient practice, you'll become adept at recognizing the words.  A key difference lies in conjugation. Unlike な-adjectives, い-adjectives cannot be followed by だ.  Instead, use です for polite forms.",
  "etymology": "The term \"い-adjective\" is a descriptive term created by language teachers.  The い ending is a grammatical marker that differentiates them from な-adjectives.  The historical development of い-adjectives is complex and involves various linguistic changes over centuries.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while です is commonly used with い-adjectives, it's technically grammatically incorrect. Since です is the polite form of だ, it should adhere to だ's grammatical rules. However, because it is commonly used in everyday speech and is understandable, it is considered grammatically correct by most native speakers.  Practice using both plain and polite forms to develop a natural sense of the language.",

Pay close attention to the conjugation of いい (good), as it is an irregular form. This distinction will greatly enhance your Japanese proficiency."
