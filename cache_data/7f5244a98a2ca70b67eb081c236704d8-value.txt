  "writeup": "The expression てたまらない, literally 'cannot bear,' is a fascinating grammatical construction in Japanese. It combines the continuative form of a verb (て-form) with the negative past form of the verb 堪える (taeru) meaning 'to bear,' 'to endure,' or 'to tolerate.' This results in two primary meanings:\n\n* **'Can't help but want to (A)':**  This usage frequently appears with verbs conjugated with たい (tai), indicating desire. For example, \"見たくてたまらない\" (mitakute tamaranai) means \"I can't help but want to see it.\"  The feeling is one of overwhelming desire that's difficult to control.\n* **'Extremely (A)':**  This meaning often pairs with い-adjectives and な-adjectives.  In these cases, think of it as expressing an intense degree of the adjective's quality.  \"眠くてたまらない\" (nemukute tamaranai) means \"I'm extremely sleepy.\" The feeling is intense and almost unbearable.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* The choice between て and で depends on the type of adjective: て is used with い-adjectives, while で is used with な-adjectives.\n* The nuance shifts depending on the context and the word it modifies.  The underlying meaning always relates to an intense feeling that's difficult to bear, whether it's desire or an unpleasant sensation.\n\nMastering this nuanced expression will significantly enrich your Japanese vocabulary and communication skills.",
