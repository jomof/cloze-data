        "[Verb/Adjective (informal)] + だろう": "Expresses the speaker's conjecture, expectation, or seeking agreement.",

    },
    "etymology": "だろう is a contraction of であろう (dearou), which is the volitional form of the copula だ (da). Over time, it evolved from expressing volition to expressing conjecture and expectation.",
    "writeup": "だろう is a conjugated form of だ, and can also be seen in the contracted form だろ (more casual). だろう expresses that the speaker thinks that something is true (assertion/expectation), and also that the listener would probably agree with them. This comes across like \"right?\", or \"probably\" in English.\n\nだろう carries exactly the same meaning as でしょう (the polite equivalent). However, due to だ being more casual than です, だろう is also considered to be more casual/masculine than でしょう.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   While だろう is usually used when the speaker has some sort of information that would support their assertion, it can also be used simply when the speaker \"feels\" that something is true.\n*   In this kind of sentence that expresses a \"feeling\" or \"hunch\", だろう comes across as quite low confidence. The speaker's tone of voice will often reveal how confident だろう is.",
