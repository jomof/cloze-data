  "writeup": "に加えて (ni kuwaete) means \"in addition to.\" It's a formal phrase, often used in written Japanese or more formal spoken contexts.  It combines the particle に (ni) indicating the subject or object of an action, and the te-form of 加える (kuwaeru), meaning \"to add.\"  Think of it as a sophisticated way to say 'besides' or 'on top of that.' This structure elegantly expresses a supplementary element, often emphasizing the cumulative effect.  While the hiragana form にくわえて is also used, the kanji form adds a layer of formality.  Mastering this phrase enhances the sophistication of your Japanese expression.",
  "etymology": "This phrase is a combination of the particle に (ni), indicating the target of an action or state, and the te-form of 加える (kuwaeru), meaning 'to add.'  The te-form connects it to a following clause explaining the additional element.",
