    "Register": "Generally neutral, but can be formal or informal depending on the surrounding context.",
    "Function": "Indicates the reason, cause, or means by which something occurs.",
    "Nuance": "Implies a more direct or objective causal relationship than 「から」 or 「ので」. It's often used for stating facts or giving explanations in a straightforward manner. It cannot be used to express a request or suggestion.",
    "Source": "Can be thought of as originating from the te-form of です, indicating a state or condition that leads to a result."
  },
  "etymology": "The particle 「で」 used to indicate reason or cause is believed to have originated from the 「て」 form of the copula 「です」. This evolution suggests a progression from describing a state or condition to indicating that the state is the cause of a subsequent event or situation.",
  "writeup": "The particle 「で」 indicates a reason, cause, or means by which something happens. It expresses a more direct and objective causal relationship compared to 「から」 or 「ので」. Think of it as explaining *why* something is the case or *how* something was done. It's like saying \"because of this fact...\" or \"by means of this method...\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「で」 cannot be used to express requests or suggestions. Use 「から」 or 「ので」 for that purpose.\n*   It connects a noun or noun phrase to the reason or cause.\n*   The nuance of 「で」 is quite direct, stating facts or explanations plainly.",
