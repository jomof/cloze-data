  "etymology": "どうにも is a compound expression.  どう (dō) means 'how' or 'in what way,' に (ni) is a particle indicating manner or means, and も (mo) is a particle that adds emphasis, often translating to 'even' or 'also.'  The combination expresses a sense of helplessness or inevitability.",
  "writeup": "どうにも (dōnimo) is a versatile expression conveying the inability to do something, regardless of effort. It's often paired with negative verb forms like できない (dekinai, 'cannot') or ならない (naranaimasen, 'won't happen').  Think of it as expressing 'no matter what,' 'there's nothing one can do,' or 'it's impossible.'  The nuance leans toward resignation or frustration.  It's commonly placed at the beginning or end of sentences, setting the stage for an explanation of an unavoidable situation. The addition of こうにも (kōnimo) further intensifies the feeling of helplessness. While grammatically neutral, the inherent sense of limitation often directs focus toward actions outside the speaker's control.",
