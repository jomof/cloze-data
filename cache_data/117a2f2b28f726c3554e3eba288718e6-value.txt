  "writeup": "The word くせに (kuse ni) is a grammatical particle that expresses a contrast or contradiction between two clauses.  It's often used to express criticism or disapproval, conveying a sense of 'despite' or 'even though,' but with a stronger implication of reproach.  It literally combines the noun くせ (kuse), meaning 'habit' or 'quirk,' with the particle に (ni), indicating a circumstantial or adversative relationship.  Think of it as a more emphatic and critical version of 'despite' or 'although.'  The nuance often implies that the speaker finds the second action or state unacceptable given the first.  Unlike similar expressions, くせに often carries a slightly informal and even somewhat confrontational tone. It’s versatile, used after the attributive form of i-adjectives, na-adjectives, and nouns.",
  "etymology": "The noun 癖 (kuse) originally referred to a preference or tendency, but over time, it developed a more negative connotation, often referring to a bad habit or flaw. The particle に (ni) adds the adversative or contrastive element, highlighting the incongruity between the preceding clause and the following one.",

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "male",

      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal register is established through the use of 「医者なのに」 and the strong disapproval expressed in 「とんでもない」. The structure of the sentence clearly contrasts the speaker's expectation of the doctor's conduct with their actual behavior."

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how くせに highlights the hypocrisy or incongruity.  The more significant the contrast, the stronger the criticism implied.  The sentence structure is quite flexible, working well with various adjectives and nouns.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "のに",

    },
    {

      "term": "が",
      "nuance": "が, as a conjunction, indicates a simple contrast or concession, lacking the critical implication of くせに."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While several particles and expressions can indicate contrast, くせに stands out because of its strongly critical and judgmental undertone.  Choosing the right particle depends on the desired level of formality and the emotional weight you wish to convey.  Consider the implied criticism when selecting between these options."
