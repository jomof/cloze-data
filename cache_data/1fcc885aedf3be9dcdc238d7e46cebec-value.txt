    "writeup": "とみえる (primarily written only in hiragana) is a phrase that combines the case marking particle と with the る-Verb 見える 'to appear', or 'to be visible'. This use of the と particle in Japanese is called a **result**, and marks when (A) is something that has come to a conclusion, or can be concluded. In this way, とみえる literally means 'from the way it appears, one can conclude that it's (A)'. However, this translates a bit more smoothly as 'it can be deduced that (A)', or 'it seems that (A)'.\n\nThis expression is always used directly after the phrase that it is drawing as a conclusion. However, nouns and な-Adjectives will require だ before とみえる.\n\nWhile this phrase expresses conjecture (making a guess about something), it usually implies that the speaker has done some sort of research, or has some reason that led them to 'draw (A) as a conclusion'. Due to this, it appears reasonably confident.\n\n**Fun Fact**: と always 'sums up' things. As a quotation, it sums up the phrase before it as either something that was said or thought. As 一緒に 'being together', it sums up groups of things that are existing/performing actions mutually. Lastly, as a result, it sums up causes and then illustrates their effects.",
