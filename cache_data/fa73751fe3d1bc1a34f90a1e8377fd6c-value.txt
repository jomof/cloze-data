    "etymology": "「一方」 literally means \"one direction\". The grammar point implies that something is moving in a single, consistent direction, whether it's increasing, decreasing, improving, or worsening.",
    "writeup": "「一方だ」 is used to express that something is continuously changing in **one direction**. It conveys the meaning of \"more and more,\" \"continuing to,\" or \"getting -er and -er.\" This grammar point is often used in formal speech or writing. It is paired with the auxiliary verb 「だ」 at the end of a sentence or 「で」 when followed by an explanation. It's important to note that 「一方だ」 can only be used with verbs that express some kind of **change**, as it itself only describes a continuous direction. Verbs like 「増える」 (increase), 「下がる」 (decrease), or verbs ending in 「…なる」, 「…てくる」, or 「…ていく」 are suitable.",
