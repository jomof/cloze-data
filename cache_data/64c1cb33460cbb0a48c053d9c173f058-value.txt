  "writeup": "からして, meaning \"even...,\" \"judging from...,\" or \"based on...,\" combines the particle から (\"from\") and the て-form of する (\"to do\").  It's used when the speaker makes a partially objective judgment about something (A), often implying an inference rather than a definitive statement.  Think of it as \"going from (A), (B)\" – (A) is the limited information or method used to reach conclusion (B).  The nuance is that (A) alone provides the basis for judgment, suggesting the full picture isn't known.  からして immediately follows the noun representing the basis of judgment.  Because the judgment is partial, it conveys a sense of probability: \"from this evidence, (B) is likely.\"",
  "etymology": "からして is a combination of the particle から (kara, from) and the て-form of する (suru, to do). The て-form indicates the action or state of 'going from', thus the overall meaning is 'judging from' or 'based on'.",
