    "writeup": "**代わりに (kawari ni)** means \"instead of,\" \"in place of,\" or \"in exchange for.\" The noun 代わり (kawari) means \"a substitute.\" The particle に (ni) marks 代わり, indicating what is being replaced. The phrase often appears at the beginning of a sentence to suggest a better option. While 替わり (kawari) can sometimes replace 代わり, the nuance remains almost identical in this grammatical structure. Note that because 代わり is a noun, it follows the attributive form of any preceding word.",
    "etymology": "「代わり」 comes from the verb 「代わる (kawaru)」 which means \"to replace\" or \"to substitute.\" The 「に (ni)」 particle indicates direction or purpose, so 「代わりに (kawari ni)」 literally means \"for the purpose of replacing.\"",
