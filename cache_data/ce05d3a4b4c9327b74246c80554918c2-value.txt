    "etymology": "The grammar point is derived from the verbs 通じる (tsūjiru), meaning \"to flow,\" \"to go through,\" or \"to understand,\" and 通す (toosu), meaning \"to let pass,\" \"to allow,\" or \"to conduct.\" The intransitive 通じる often relates to communication, while the transitive 通す often relates to physical passage or intentional action.",
    "writeup": "「を通じて」 and 「を通して」 are two Japanese grammar patterns with very similar meanings, often translated as \"through,\" \"via,\" or \"throughout.\" The key distinction lies in the verbs they originate from: 通じる (intransitive) and 通す (transitive). Because of this difference:\n\n*   「を通じて」 is more common when referring to information or communication that occurs **through** a connection or medium. Think of it as something \"flowing through.\"\n*   「を通して」 is more common when referring to a direct location that something is transferred through, or when something is done **intentionally** by use of a specific means. Think of it as \"making a path.\"\n\nAs this expression begins with を, it will appear after nouns, before expressing in the (B) part of the sentence exactly what was done 'through' (A).",
