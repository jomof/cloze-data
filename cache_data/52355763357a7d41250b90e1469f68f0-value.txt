  "writeup": "The phrase どころではない emphasizes that something is 'far from' a certain state or that it's 'out of the question.'  It suggests the actual situation is even more significant or pressing than what's being compared.  This grammar point typically appears at the end of a phrase describing an undesirable situation.  The negative ではない can be replaced with the more casual じゃない.  Another interpretation translates to \"it is not the time for…,\" implying something is impossible due to more important circumstances. This usage reflects the speaker's personal judgment.",
  "etymology": "The phrase combines どころ (dokoro), meaning 'place' or 'extent,' and ではない (de wa nai), the negative form of だ (da) 'to be'.  The use of どころ in this context evolved from its literal meaning to signify the degree or extent to which something is true or applicable. The phrase's intensification stems from this juxtaposition of a spatial concept with a negative judgment.",
