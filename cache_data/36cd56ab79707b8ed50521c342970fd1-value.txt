    "etymology": "The word 「訳 (わけ)」 itself means \"reason,\" \"cause,\" or \"meaning.\" The 「だ」 is the copula, indicating assertion. Together, 「わけだ」 signifies \"it is the reason,\" or \"it is the conclusion.\"",
    "writeup": "「わけだ」 is used to express a reason, conclusion, or explanation based on prior information or context. It is similar to saying \"so that's why,\" \"no wonder,\" or \"as you'd expect\" in English. The nuance implies that something has become clear or understandable due to a preceding fact.\n\nIt connects to verbs and i-adjectives in their plain forms, and to nouns and na-adjectives with the addition of 「だ」. It can be used in both casual and polite speech, with the polite form being 「わけです」. Essentially, it highlights the plain existence of something in the same way that 'so' does in English, ranging from giving a \"because\" feeling, all the way to simple emphasis (like with \"naturally\", and \"as you'd expect\"). 「わけだ」 can also be used in questions, implying that the speaker is trying to confirm something they've heard. 「わけだね」 (so it's (A), right?) and 「わけですか」 (so is it that (A)?) are good examples of this.",
