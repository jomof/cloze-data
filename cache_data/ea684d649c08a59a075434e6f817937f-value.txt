    "writeup": "ものか is a set expression in Japanese used to strongly express the speaker's conviction that something will absolutely not happen or is definitely untrue. It combines the noun もの (\"thing\") with the question particle か, conveying a rhetorical question or strong negation.  It's similar to saying \"as if!\" in English.  The nuance implies disbelief or a strong opposition to the idea being presented. You can think of it as the speaker saying, \"Do you seriously believe that?\".  It can follow verbs, i-adjectives, and na-adjectives or nouns with な.\n\nOther variations like もんか, もんですか, and ものですか exist, with もんですか and ものですか being more traditionally used by women.\n\nWhen ものか follows the た-form of a verb, it expresses the speaker's feeling that they cannot bear for something negative to happen.",
