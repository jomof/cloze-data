  "writeup": "にみえる, primarily written in hiragana, combines the particle に with the verb 見える (mieru, 'to be visible').  This construction indicates that something *appears* to be a certain way.  It's frequently used with nouns to express the visual impression, suggesting that something 'looks like (A)'.  You can enhance the sense of uncertainty or subjective perception by adding auxiliary verbs like ようだ (yōda) or そうだ (sōda) in their adverbial forms ように (yōni) and そうに (sōni), respectively.  This shifts the meaning closer to 'it seems to be (A)'.  Alternatively, the similar expression みたい (mitai) can be used, resulting in 見たようにみえる (mitai ni mieru), reinforcing the speaker's tentative conclusion.  Remember, kanji is rarely used in this grammatical construction; it's typically written in hiragana to emphasize its function as a set phrase. Using kanji might misdirect the reader to focus on the kanji's individual meaning, rather than its grammatical function within the sentence.",
  "etymology": "The phrase にみえる is a grammatical construction combining the particle に (ni), indicating a state or condition, and the verb 見える (mieru), an intransitive verb meaning 'to be visible' or 'to appear.' The verb 見える itself derives from the verb 見 (mi, 'to see') + え (e, a connective form) + る (ru, a verb ending). The meaning of にみえる is built upon this foundation, implying 'to be seen as' or 'to appear to be'.",
