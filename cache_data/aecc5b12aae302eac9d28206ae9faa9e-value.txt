    "writeup": "嫌いがある is a combination of the noun きらい \"a dislike\", the case-marking particle が, and the う-Verb ある \"to be\". It is used to indicate the presence of negative tendencies or habits and can be translated as \"to have a tendency to (A)\" or \"to be prone to (A)\". This structure follows the dictionary form of verbs, verbs negated with ない, or nouns ending with の. A more literal translation of 嫌いがある could be \"having the displeasure of (A)\", with the \"tendency\" being implied. Because 嫌いがある is quite strong, it's often used with words that soften the meaning, such as 少し \"a little bit\" or どうも \"try as one might\".\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nSince 嫌いがある describes things \"displeasurable\" from the speaker's perspective, it's generally not used to refer to oneself.",
