    "etymology": "「て」 indicates the reason or means, 「当然」 (とうぜん) means \"natural\" or \"as a matter of course\", and 「だ」 is the plain form of \"desu\", acting as a copula here.",
    "writeup": "「て当然だ」 (te touzen da) expresses that something is **natural** or **expected**. It combines the て-form of a verb or い-adjective (or で with nouns and な-adjectives), the noun 「当然」 (とうぜん – touzen, meaning \"naturally\" or \"of course\"), and the copula 「だ」. This construction emphasizes that a particular outcome or feeling is a logical and predictable consequence of the preceding action or state.  It often conveys a sense of **obviousness** or **inevitability**.",
