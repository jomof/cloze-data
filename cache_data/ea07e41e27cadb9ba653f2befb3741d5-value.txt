  "writeup": "を経て (keite) is a formal grammatical particle used to indicate a process or experience that precedes a result.  It literally translates to \"having passed through\" or \"via.\"  The verb 経る (keiru), meaning \"to elapse,\" \"to pass (time),\" or \"to experience,\" forms the basis of this particle.  Unlike 過ぎる (sugiru), which emphasizes the completion of a period, 経る emphasizes the continuous nature of the process. Therefore,  を経て often conveys the idea of \"having undergone\" a particular experience. This particle usually follows a noun describing the process and is followed by a sentence explaining the outcome or significance of that process.  Its formal nature makes it suitable for contexts like biographies, formal reports, or academic writing.  Avoid using it in casual conversation.",
  "etymology": "The particleを経て is derived from the verb 経る (keiru), meaning \"to pass through\" or \"to experience.\" The て-form of 経る (keite) combines with the particle form to create this expression.  The emphasis on the continuous nature of the passage of time or experience is crucial to understanding its usage.",
