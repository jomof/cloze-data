    "etymology": "ないで is formed from the negative auxiliary verb ない (nai) and the particle で (de), which typically indicates means or manner. Here, で indicates the manner in which the second action occurs – that is, without performing the first action.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point ないで (naide) expresses the idea of \"without doing (A), (B)\" or \"not doing (A) and then doing (B).\" It is formed by attaching で to the negative plain form of a verb (ない form). ないで indicates that the action described by the verb did not occur before the subsequent action. It can also be used to make a request, asking someone *not* to do something. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Contrast with なくて:** Both ないで and なくて can mean \"without doing,\" but ないで emphasizes that the action (B) is being done without (A), while なくて emphasizes (A) as the reason for something.\n*   **Requests:** ないで can be used in conjunction with ください to make a polite request *not* to do something (しないでください - please don't do).",
