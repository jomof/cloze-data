    "etymology": "The word 「つもり」 comes from the verb 「積もる (tsumoru)」, which means \"to pile up.\" The nuance is that you've 'piled up' the necessary resolve or preparation to do something. Therefore, it can also carry the implication of doing something out of character, as if you had to 'pile up' feelings to act that way.",
    "writeup": "「つもりだ」 expresses intention or plan. It connects to the dictionary form of verbs (to express intention to do) or the ない form of verbs (to express intention not to do). The 「は」 in 「つもりはない」 is interchangeable with 「が」; 「が」 gives a feeling of disinterest, while 「じゃ」 expresses that something is not the intended result.  The polite form is 「つもりです」.",
