    "etymology": "The word 「あれ」 is derived from the verb 「あ-る」 (aru), meaning \"to be\" or \"to exist,\" combined with the suffix 「れ」. This suggests something that is 'there' or 'exists' in a distant location. Consider also the correlation to 「こそあど」words like 「これ、それ、あれ、どれ」, all used to indicate location, with 「あれ」 being the furthest.",
    "writeup": "「あれ」, just like 「これ」 and 「それ」, is one of several pronoun-like words in Japanese (substitute nouns). 「あれ」 translates roughly to \"that over there\" in English. Unlike 「それ」, 「あれ」 is used to highlight things that are away from both the speaker and the listener. Due to this, it is often translated as \"that over there.\" Be careful not to mix up 「あれ」 with the common spoken expression 「あれ」, which means \"huh?\" or \"oh?\". These are not the same words. The difference will usually be clear from context within a sentence, and the way the word is said. 「あれ」 as \"huh?\" has a rising tone and sounds like a question.",
