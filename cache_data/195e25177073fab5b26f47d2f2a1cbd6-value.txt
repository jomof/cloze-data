    "etymology": "The particle へ originates from the directional usage of the 絵 (e, picture/direction) character, evolving to represent the concept of 'towards' or 'in the direction of'.",
    "writeup": "へ is a particle used to indicate the direction or destination of movement. It signifies \"to\" or \"toward.\" While sometimes interchangeable with に, へ emphasizes the direction and the journey or effort involved in reaching the destination, whereas に focuses more on the arrival or the connection to the destination. Consider 「東京へ行く」 (go to Tokyo), where へ indicates movement in the direction of Tokyo. Phrases like 「〜へようこそ」 (welcome to ~) often use へ because they acknowledge the effort made to arrive at that place. While interchangeable with に in some contexts, understanding the nuance of directionality is key. In polite expressions, you may see 「テレビへようこそ」('welcome to the TV show') which is a polite way of saying 'Thank you for watching our show'",
