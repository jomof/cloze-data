  "writeup": "なかなか (or 中々 in kanji) is an adverb in Japanese often translated as 'very' or 'considerably'.  It's frequently paired directly with adjectives or placed before nouns, with の inserted between なかなか and the noun.  Intriguingly, なかなか can also subtly imply something is 軽視しがたい (keishishigataki), meaning 'difficult to dismiss'—closer to English expressions like 'nothing to scoff at' or 'not to be taken lightly'.  The nuance of なかなか highlights that something is 'considerably/extremely (A)' or 'far more (A) than expected'.  Think of a dartboard representing the intensity level of a word; なかなか hits the bullseye—the 'middle' or 'most' (A), emphasizing that (A) is a prime example of (B).  Its etymology stems from the kanji 中 (naka), meaning 'within', suggesting the 'middle' or 'most' representative example.",
  "etymology": "The word なかなか comes from the kanji 中々, where 中 means \"middle\" or \"within.\"  This reflects the nuance of the adverb:  something is not just good, but significantly, centrally, or remarkably good.",

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",

      "setting": "first-date",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of あなた (anata), a more polite form of \"you\", keeps the tone respectful and appropriate for a first date, while the direct expression of feeling still conveys interest. 「あなたと一緒なら」 sets up a hopeful and positive tone, expressing strong feelings about being together."

      "term": "あまり～ない",
      "meaning": "Not very, Not much, Not really, Hardly",
