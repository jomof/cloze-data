  "writeup": "The particle phrase \"に向かって・に向けて\" (ni mukatte/ni mukete) indicates direction or purpose.  It literally translates to \"towards\" or \"in the direction of.\"  Understanding its nuances is key.  It's derived from the verb 向かう (mukau) meaning 'to go towards' or 'to face,' specifically using its て-form (ni mukatte).  The nuance shifts subtly depending on the context.  When referring to a physical direction, it's similar to へ (e). However, it often emphasizes intentionality, effort, or a sustained action towards a goal.  に向けて (ni mukete) is a slightly more formal variation, often implying something is directed *towards* or *designed for* a specific purpose or audience.  This subtle difference is important to grasp. This grammatical construction is fundamental in expressing purpose and direction in Japanese, and mastering its varied uses elevates fluency.",
  "etymology": "The particle phrase \"に向かって・に向けて\" originates from the verb 向かう (mukau), meaning 'to face' or 'to go toward.'  The \"に\" (ni) is the particle indicating direction, and \"向けて\" (mukete) is the て-form of the verb 向ける (mukeru), the causative form of 向かう (mukau). The use of the て-form signifies an ongoing or continuous action in the direction of the object.",
