    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ていく」 combines the conjunctive particle 「て」 with the verb 「行く」(いく, \"to go\").  The basic structure is **Verb (て-form) + いく**. The core meaning conveys a sense of departure or progression away from the speaker's current point in time or space.\n\nWhen used with verbs describing actions, 「ていく」 indicates that an action is performed and then moves away or continues.  Think of it as \"doing something and then going\".  Whether 「いく」 is in the present or past tense determines the timing of the progression.  Present tense 「ていく」 often implies an action that starts now and continues into the future, or something that will happen and then continue. Past tense 「ていった」 indicates an action that happened and then moved away or progressed.\n\n「ていく」 can be used both literally, describing physical movement, and figuratively, describing the passage of time or the progression of a situation.  When referring to physical movement, the kanji 「行く」 is more common, but hiragana 「いく」 is also possible. When referring to time or abstract progression, hiragana 「いく」 is generally preferred.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「ていく」 often emphasizes the continuation or ongoing nature of an action or state as it moves forward.\n*   It is the opposite of 「てくる」, which describes something approaching or continuing towards the speaker.\n*   In temporal contexts, 「ていく」 can be similar to \"going on to do something\" in English, highlighting a transition to a subsequent stage or action.",
