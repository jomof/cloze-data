  "writeup": "いきなり, almost exclusively written in hiragana, is an adverb meaning \"suddenly,\" \"all of a sudden,\" or \"for no reason.\"  It indicates an abrupt event without warning.  Because it's an adverb, it usually appears at the sentence's beginning or directly before the verb it modifies.  Interestingly, いきなり comes from 行き成り, though the kanji form is rare.  Its original meaning referred to a situation's unfolding, giving it a nuance similar to the English phrase \"a sudden turn of events.\" Thus, while often used simply as \"suddenly,\" it implies an unexpected development.",
  "etymology": "いきなり derives from 行き成り (yuki-nari), literally meaning \"going-becoming.\"  The kanji form highlights the sense of a sudden transition or change in state.  Over time, the shortened hiragana form, いきなり, became the predominant usage, losing some of the original nuance of a process unfolding but retaining the core idea of suddenness.",
