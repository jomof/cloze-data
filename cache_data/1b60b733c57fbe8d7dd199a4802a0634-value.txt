  "writeup": "びる, similar to めく, is a verb suffix exclusively used after nouns or occasionally the stem of い-adjectives.  It's a る-verb, often translated as \"(A)-looking,\" \"(A)-seeming,\" or \"behaving like (A).\"  **びる is quite formal** and appears with a limited set of expressions. It indicates that something \"gives off the sense of (A)\" based on visual observation. Being descriptive, it changes to びた when directly modifying a noun.  \n\n**Etymology:** The suffix's origin is complex and intertwined with other descriptive verbal suffixes, reflecting a gradual evolution in expressing nuanced descriptive qualities in Japanese.  The sense of visual appearance is crucial to its usage. \n\n**Important Considerations:**  This grammar point is generally used in more formal written contexts, and its usage is far less common than other descriptive expressions.  The resulting phrase often has a slightly literary or archaic feel.",
