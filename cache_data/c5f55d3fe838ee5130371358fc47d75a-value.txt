    "etymology": "This particle 「で」 originates from the Japanese word 「にて (nite)」, which was used in classical Japanese to indicate location, time, means, or cause. Over time, 「にて」 evolved into 「で」, with its usage becoming more specialized to indicate the means or method of doing something, the place where an action occurs, or, as in this case, a time limit or deadline.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「で」, when used with time expressions, indicates a deadline or a limit. It specifies the point in time **by which** something must be finished or reached. It's important to note that this usage of 「で」 is distinct from its other functions, such as indicating location or means. For example, 「明日で」 means 'by tomorrow', indicating a deadline.",

            "etymology": "「飲み終わります」combines 「飲む」 (to drink) with 「終わる」 (to end), indicating the completion of the action of drinking the medicine."
