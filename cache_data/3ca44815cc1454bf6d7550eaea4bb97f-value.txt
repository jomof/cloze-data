    "writeup": "**場合は (baai wa)** translates to \"in the event of (A)\" or \"in the case of (A)\".  It's used to describe a hypothetical situation or a viewpoint, often contrasting it with something else.  The word **場合 (baai)** itself means \"case\" or \"situation\".

When using 場合は:

*   Follow nouns with **の (no)**.
*   Follow な-adjectives with **な (na)**.
*   Verbs and い-adjectives are used in their dictionary form directly before 場合は.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Contrastive Nuance:** When highlighting someone's viewpoint, 場合は often implies a contrast with something already discussed, leveraging the contrastive function of the は particle.
*   **Nuance of Randomness:** Because 場合 literally means \"to encounter (A)\", it carries a nuance of **randomness**.  Therefore, 場合は is generally **not used** for events that happen regularly or are planned/controlled. For regular occurrences, use **ときは (toki wa)** instead.
