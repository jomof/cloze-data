  "etymology": "The suffix 「ら」 comes from the kanji 「等」, which means \"etc.\" or \"and so on.\" This origin gives 「ら」 the nuance of indicating 'more than one' of something, similar to a pluralizing suffix.",
  "writeup": "The suffix 「ら」 is attached to pronouns to indicate plurality. It originates from the kanji 「等」, carrying a meaning similar to \"etc.\" or \"and so on.\" Because of this etymology, 「ら」 suggests that there is more than one of the pronoun being referred to. **However**, it's crucial to be aware that 「ら」 can sometimes be perceived as rude, especially when used to refer to people. This is because it can sound dismissive or overly casual. In many situations, using 「達」 is a more appropriate and polite way to indicate plurality when referring to people. Think of 「ら」 as adding an \"etc.\" to the pronoun, which isn't always the most respectful way to refer to individuals. Use caution, especially in formal situations. It is more often used with 「彼、彼女、俺、君、奴」",
