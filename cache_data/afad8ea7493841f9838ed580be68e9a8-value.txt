  "writeup": "ということは is a versatile Japanese phrase often used mid-sentence to signal a clarification or inference based on a preceding statement.  It translates to \"that means\" or \"that is to say.\"  While often followed by ということだ, this isn't mandatory.  A more literal translation might be \"that which is said to be (A), (B)\" – presenting (A) as something needing further explanation.  Interestingly, こと は can also initiate sentences, usually as a confirming question, translating to \"So you mean to say that (A)?\"  The structure's beauty lies in its components: という (\"that which is said\"), こと (\"thing\"), and は (\"topic marker\").  It simply presents the 'thing' categorized as (A) as generally understood to be (B).",
  "etymology": "The phrase's etymology is straightforward.  It combines という (to say), こと (thing/matter), and は (topic marker). The combination expresses a logical deduction or clarification based on a previously stated 'thing'. The use of は emphasizes the 'thing' as the topic under discussion.",
