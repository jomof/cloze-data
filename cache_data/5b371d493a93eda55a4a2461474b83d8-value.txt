    "writeup": "「んがため」 is a grammar pattern used to express the purpose of an action, meaning \"in order to,\" \"to,\" or \"for the purpose of.\" The 「ん」 comes from the classical auxiliary verb 「む」, which conveys intention or strong will, similar to 「う」 and 「よう」 in modern Japanese. It is followed by 「が」 and the noun 「ため」, meaning \"sake\" or \"purpose.\" 「ん」 connects to the **nai-stem** of verbs. Usually, either 「の」 or 「に」 follows 「んがため」, depending on whether it's directly followed by a noun or a clause containing a verb.\n\nThe 「む」's sense of intention is retained in 「ん」, indicating the speaker's strong will to achieve the stated purpose. Because 「む」 expresses intent, the verb preceding 「ん」 must be something the speaker can control.\n\n**Important Consideration:** Like other classical structures involving 「する」, the older form 「せ」 is used as the base instead of 「し」. For example, 「する」 becomes 「せん」.",
    "etymology": "The 「ん」 in 「んがため」 comes from the classical auxiliary verb 「む」, which expressed intention or volition. The 「が」 is a case marker, and 「ため」 means \"purpose\" or \"sake.\" The combination signifies acting with a specific purpose in mind.",
