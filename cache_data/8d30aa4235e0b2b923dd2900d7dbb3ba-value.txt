  "writeup": "The grammar point ことから indicates a conclusion drawn from observed facts.  It's a combination of こと (thing, fact) and から (from).  Literally, it means 'from the fact that…,' but it's usually translated as 'from the fact that…,' 'because of…,' or 'judging from…'.  The word preceding ことから must be in the attributive form.  This differs from ことだから, where から functions as a conjunction, establishing a cause-and-effect relationship rather than inferring a conclusion from evidence.  ことだから means 'because' or 'since'.  Mastering this subtle difference is key to using ことから accurately and naturally.",
  "etymology": "ことから is a combination of こと (koto), meaning 'thing' or 'fact,' and から (kara), meaning 'from.'  The particle から here indicates the origin or source of the conclusion.  The combination expresses the idea of deriving a conclusion from a preceding fact.  The use of こと, a noun referring to a state of affairs, emphasizes the reasoned nature of the conclusion.",
