  "writeup": "“ものと思う (mono to omou)” is a nuanced expression formed from the noun 物 (mono, ‘thing’), the particle と (to, indicating a quoted object of thought), and the verb 思う (omou, ‘to think’).  It conveys a sense of firm belief, expectation, or confidence in something.  The use of 物 allows for the expression of abstract ideas by connecting them to a concrete notion of certainty.  Think of it as expressing 'I have this firm belief about this abstract thing that is just as certain as something concrete'.  This construction is fairly formal and prevalent in written Japanese. The past tense, ものと思った (mono to omotta) or ものと思いました (mono to omoimashita), shifts the meaning towards a past conviction or a past impression. While the grammar is formal, it may pop up in daily conversations, particularly when someone is expressing a strong, reasoned opinion.",
