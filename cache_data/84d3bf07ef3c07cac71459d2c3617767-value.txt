  "writeup": "となると is a powerful expression in Japanese, emphasizing that once a certain threshold is reached, a consequence inevitably follows.  It highlights the unavoidable nature of the outcome.  While seen in various forms (ともなると, となれば, ともなれば), the core structure combines the particle と, the u-verb なる ('to become'), and the emphatic particle と.  Standard translations include 'once (A), (B)' and 'when (A), (B)'. A more literal interpretation is 'once (A) happens, it's certain that (B) will occur'.  The particle も adds subtle emphasis.  Although ば and と have slightly different nuances generally, they're used interchangeably in this specific grammar point.  となると follows nouns or verbs in any standard form.  The emphasis inherent in this pattern partially stems from the first と, explaining why になると isn't used for similar meanings.  The use of に and と reflects a common pattern in Japanese, with と suggesting an unavoidable outcome and に simply indicating a transition.",
