    "etymology": "別に (betsuni) literally means \"separately\" or \"individually.\" When used with a negative verb (ない), it takes on the nuance of \"not particularly\" or \"not especially.\" The negation implies that the thing being discussed is not in a special or distinct category.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 別に (betsuni), meaning \"separately,\" shifts its nuance slightly when paired with a negative verb ending in ない, whether it's the negative form of an い-adjective or the auxiliary verb ない. In this context, 別に〜ない conveys a sense of \"not particularly\" or \"not especially.\"  The literal idea is that something cannot be singled out or seen as distinct. It suggests that while something might be true to some extent, it's not emphatically so.  It's **important** to note that while 別に can express uncertainty, it should not be used with わけがない (there's no way that...), as these express opposing levels of certainty.",
