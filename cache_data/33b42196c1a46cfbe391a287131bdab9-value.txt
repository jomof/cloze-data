    "writeup": "**逆に (gyaku ni)** literally translates to \"in reverse\" or \"in the opposite way.\" It's used to express that something is the opposite of what was previously said or expected.  Think of it as saying \"conversely,\" \"on the other hand,\" or \"rather.\"  It can be used to introduce a contrasting statement or to rebut a previous point. In casual conversation, especially when asked about preferences, 「逆に」 can also be used as a softer way of saying 「別に (betsuni - not really/nothing in particular)」, indicating a lack of strong preference.  It often appears at the beginning of the sentence or clause it modifies.",
