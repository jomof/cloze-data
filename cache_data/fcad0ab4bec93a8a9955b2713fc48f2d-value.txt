    "etymology": "「ものと思う」 is composed of 「物(もの)」, meaning \"thing\" or \"matter,\" 「と」, a particle indicating content or thought, and 「思う(おもう)」, meaning \"to think\" or \"to believe.\" Etymologically, it suggests considering something as a definitive or concrete matter, implying a strong conviction or expectation.",
    "writeup": "「ものと思う」 expresses a strong belief, expectation, or conviction about something. It combines the noun 「物(もの)」 (thing), the particle 「と」 (that), and the verb 「思う(おもう)」 (to think). The pattern suggests viewing something as a concrete or reliable matter. When 「思う」 is in the past tense (思った), it can mean \"I was under the impression that.\" While slightly formal, it occasionally appears in everyday speech.",
