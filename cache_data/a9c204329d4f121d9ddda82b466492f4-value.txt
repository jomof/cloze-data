    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にもかかわらず」 is derived from 「に」 (particle), 「も」 (particle), the verb 「拘わる(かかわる)」 (to be involved, to be affected by), and 「ず」 (archaic negative auxiliary verb). Literally, it means \"without being affected by...\"",
    "writeup": "「にもかかわらず」 is a formal Japanese grammar structure used to express \"despite\" or \"in spite of\" something. It indicates that even though a certain condition or situation exists, the expected result or consequence does not occur. It is often interchangeable with 「のに」, though 「にもかかわらず」 carries a more formal tone. It connects to verbs, い-adjectives, and nouns. Be careful not to confuse 「にもかかわらず」 with 「にかかわらず」; the former means \"despite,\" while the latter means \"regardless of.\"",
