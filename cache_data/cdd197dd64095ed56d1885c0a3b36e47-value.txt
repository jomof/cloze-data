  "writeup": "にすぎない is a common Japanese structure indicating something is 'no more than (A)' or 'merely (A)'.  It's formed from に and the negated る-verb 過ぎる (sugiru, 'to exceed').  The literal 'not exceeding (A)' closely reflects the English meanings. While slightly formal, にすぎない is frequently used in daily conversation.  This pattern follows verbs (any form), い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns.  It often pairs with intensifiers like ただ (tada, 'merely') or だけ (dake, 'just'), with だけ inserted between the target word and にすぎない (and な added before だけ for な-adjectives).  Interestingly, にすぎない sometimes appears in set phrases, such as 氷山の一角にすぎない ('just the tip of the iceberg').",
  "etymology": "The phrase にすぎない is derived from the verb 過ぎる (sugiru), meaning \"to exceed\" or \"to be more than.\"  The negative form, すぎない, coupled with the particle に, creates the nuanced meaning of \"not exceeding,\" which translates to the English interpretations of 'no more than,' 'just,' or 'merely.'  The evolution reflects the Japanese tendency to express subtle gradations of meaning through negation.",
