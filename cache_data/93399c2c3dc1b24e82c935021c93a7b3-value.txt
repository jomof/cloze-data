    "etymology": "This grammar point is a double negative, structured as '[something] + ない + はない', where the first ない negates a quality or action, and the second ない (with は) denies the existence of anything that *doesn't* fit that negation. It essentially asserts that everything is the opposite of the first negation.",
    "writeup": "〜ない〜はない is a **double negative construction**. It is used to emphasize that something is universally true. Think of it as similar to \"there isn't an (A) that doesn't (B)\" in English. It's important to understand that this construction affirms a positive statement through a double negative. For example, if you say 「彼にはできないことはない」, it means there is nothing that he cannot do; he can do everything. Note that this is different than 「なくはない」, which means \"it's not that it isn't.\" 「ない〜はない」 makes a stronger, more universal claim.",
