    "etymology": "The origin of 「いくら」 is somewhat debated. One theory suggests it comes from the verb 「幾つ (ikutsu)」, meaning 'how many', evolving to represent a general quantity or amount. Another theory suggests it derives from a corruption of 「幾許 (ikubakari)」, an archaic term meaning 'how much' or 'how little'.",
    "writeup": "「いくら」 has several uses. It's most straightforwardly used to ask \"how much\" or \"how many,\" especially concerning price. For example, asking the price of an item in a store. It can also express the idea of \"no matter how much\" or \"even if\" when followed by a verb in the te-form (て), an i-adjective with 「くて」, or a na-adjective with 「で」. Another common usage is 「いくらでも」, meaning \"any amount\" or \"as much as one wants\". Finally, 「いくらも + negative verb」 means \"not much\" or \"hardly any.\"",
