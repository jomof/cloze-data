  "writeup": "\"ついでに\" is an adverb in Japanese that's used similarly to 'while you're at it' or 'on the occasion of (A)'.  \"ついで\" itself is a noun meaning 'precedence' (as in, the first thing to happen). Thus, the literal meaning of \"ついでに\" could be interpreted as 'with (A) as the precedence, (B)'.  It's commonly used with verbs and nouns (nouns require the particle \"の\" before them).  Interestingly, just like \"precedence\" in English, \"ついでに\" implies that (A) is the instigator for (B). This makes it a great way to convey that something isn't urgent, but if (A) is happening, it's the perfect time to do (B) as well.  Important Consideration: \"ついでに\" is more formal than \"間に\" or \"時に\", so it tends to be used for one-off situations rather than regular occurrences. However, it *can* be used for regular occurrences, especially in formal or polite speech, like when talking to a senior.",
