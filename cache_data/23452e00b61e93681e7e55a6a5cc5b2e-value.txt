  "writeup": "によると and によれば are phrases used to indicate the source of information.  They translate to \"according to.\"  Both use the verb よる (yoru, to depend on), but in different grammatical forms.  によると uses the conjunctive particle と (to), implying a more certain or reliable source, often used for official statements like police reports or news articles.  によれば uses the conditional particle ば (ba), suggesting a slightly less definitive source. While largely interchangeable, the choice subtly affects the perceived reliability of the information.  The structure is typically used after a noun phrase specifying the source or with a verb plus ところ (tokoro, indicating the place or circumstance where the information was obtained).  The more formal variant によります is also used in formal settings, particularly in written communication such as news reports.  The nuances between よる and its related kanji (依る, 拠る, 因る, 由る) are fascinating but not crucial for everyday conversation.  Each kanji offers subtle differences in meaning, all revolving around the idea of (B)'s foundation being in (A).",
  "etymology": "The core of both phrases is the verb よる (yoru), meaning \"to depend on\" or \"to be based on.\"  The particle と indicates a direct connection, while ば introduces a conditional element, slightly softening the certainty. The different kanji for よる reflect subtle differences in the dependence of (B) on (A): 依る (yoru) implies dependence; 拠る (yoru) suggests origin; 因る (yoru) implies causality; 由る (yoru) suggests reason.",
