    "etymology": "The particle 「を」 originates from the verb 「離る(はなれる)」, meaning \"to separate.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate the object that is being acted upon, conceptually \"separated\" from the action itself. Its original meaning is now obsolete, but the particle remains a crucial part of Japanese grammar.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「を」 is a **case-marking particle** that primarily indicates the **direct object** of a transitive verb. In essence, it highlights what is being acted upon. Unlike English, where word order often dictates the object, 「を」 clearly marks the noun it follows as the object, regardless of its placement in the sentence. Sometimes, 「を」 can also indicate the place where an action occurs, particularly with verbs of motion. This usage emphasizes that the place itself is being interacted with during the action.",
