  "writeup": "ものを is a grammar point expressing regret or disappointment about a missed opportunity or an undesirable outcome.  It functions similarly to のに, conveying a sense of 'if only' or 'but.'  However, ものを emphasizes the speaker's displeasure more strongly, highlighting a situation where a preferable outcome should have occurred but didn't.  It's typically used when the speaker feels the alternative (the 'if only' part) was clearly the better choice.  \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   It follows verbs or い-adjectives in their dictionary form, and な-adjectives are followed by な. \n*   It's frequently preceded by hypothetical structures like ば. \n*   Often, the consequence of the unfulfilled hypothetical situation is left unstated. The unspoken part is implied by the speaker's regret over what should have happened.\n\nThe particle を, although typically marking the direct object of a verb, here functions more as a conjunction, emphasizing the desired but unrealized outcome.  It literally translates to something like 'as for the thing that [should have been],' with the rest of the sentence implying the negative outcome and the speaker's regret.",

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how in many cases the second part of the sentence (the consequence of not following the 'if only' clause) is implied but not explicitly stated. The emotion is fully conveyed in the 'if only' part, leaving the listener to imagine the undesirable result.",
  "etymology": "The construction of ものを combines the noun もの ('thing') and the particle を. While を typically marks a direct object, in this grammatical construction, it functions more as a connective particle that emphasizes the 'if only' aspect. This usage is a special case where the standard function of を is obscured, creating a unique nuance not easily captured in direct translation. The word もの itself has ancient roots, meaning 'thing,' 'object' or 'matter,' and its flexible nature allows for this unusual yet impactful usage.",
