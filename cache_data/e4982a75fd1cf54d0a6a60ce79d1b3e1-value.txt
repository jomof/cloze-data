    "etymology": "The literal meaning of 「つもり」 comes from the verb 「積もる(tsumoru)」, which means \"to pile up\" or \"to load.\" This etymology lends itself to nuances where 「つもり」 describes people doing something out of character, as if they've \"piled up\" the necessary feelings to act that way.",
    "writeup": "「つもりだ」 (or 「つもりです」) expresses intention or conviction. It's often translated as \"intend to (A)\" or \"plan to (A).\" It follows the plain form of verbs or the 「ない」 form. 「つもりはない」 implies a stronger sense of not intending to do something compared to simply not planning to do it. 「つもり」 literally comes from 「積もる」, meaning \"to pile up,\" adding nuance to situations where one acts out of character, having \"piled up\" the feeling required. When using 「つもりはない」, the 「は」 can be replaced with 「が」 or 「じゃ」, each carrying slightly different nuances. 「が」 suggests disinterest, while 「じゃ」 simply negates the intended result.",
