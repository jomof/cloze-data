        "Part of Speech": "Conjunction",

    "etymology": "「そこで」 is derived from 「そこ」 (soko), meaning \"there,\" combined with the particle 「で」 (de), indicating location or means. Over time, it evolved to signify \"at that place\" or \"at that point,\" eventually developing its conjunctive meaning.",
    "writeup": "「そこで」 is a conjunction that links a situation or event with a subsequent action or result. It conveys the sense of \"then,\" \"therefore,\" or \"at that point.\" It is used to indicate that the second clause is a logical consequence or an action taken in response to the first. \n\n*   **Usage**: It's often used to connect two related events or actions where the second action directly follows from the first. For example, 「雨が降ってきた。そこで、傘をさした。」(Ame ga futte kita. Sokode, kasa o sashita.) means \"It started raining. So, I opened my umbrella.\"\n*   **Nuance**: 「そこで」 often suggests a cause-and-effect relationship or a logical sequence of events. It's a versatile conjunction suitable for both spoken and written Japanese, though it's more commonly seen in semi-formal to formal contexts.",
