    "etymology": "「考えられない」 is the potential negative form of the verb 「考える」 (kangaeru), meaning \"to think\" or \"to consider.\" The potential form 「考えられる」 (kangaerareru) means \"can think\" or \"is conceivable.\" By adding the negative 「ない」 (nai), it becomes 「考えられない」 (kangaerarenai), meaning \"cannot think\" or \"is inconceivable.\"",
    "writeup": "「考えられない」 is the negative potential form of the verb 「考える」 ('kangaeru', to consider). It's often used with adverbs like 「など」 (nado, like, such as) or expressions that nominalize a phrase, such as 「ということは」 (to iu koto wa, the fact that). 「考えられない」 is generally translated as \"(A) is unimaginable\" or \"(A) is unthinkable,\" which is close to its literal meaning.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\n*   While 「考えられない」 refers to the inability to think of something, 「考えない」 (kangaenai, to not consider) or 「考えていない」 (kangaeteinai, to not be considering) express a conscious decision to not think about something. Because of this, only 「考えられない」 is appropriate to imply something is unbelievable.",

            "conjugation": "past (plain)",
            "nuance": "「考えられなかった」 is the past tense of 「考えられない」, expressing something that was unimaginable in the past. The sentence also uses 「でしょう」 to express conjecture."
