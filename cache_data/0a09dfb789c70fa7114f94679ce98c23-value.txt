  "writeup": "**やすい** (yasui) is an い-adjective that modifies the masu-stem of verbs.  It means \"easy to [verb]\" or, in certain contexts, \"likely to [verb]\" or \"prone to [verb].\"  This latter nuance is common when dealing with emotions. For example,  \"泣きやすい (nakiyasui)\" means \"likely to cry\" or \"easily moved to tears.\"  The adjective attaches directly to the masu-stem.  For instance, the masu-stem of  作る (tsukuru, to make) is 作り (tsukuri), so the phrase becomes 作りやすい (tsukuriyasui), meaning \"easy to make.\"  Be aware of the similar-looking adjective 安い (yasui), meaning \"cheap.\"  The kanji form 易い is rarely used; hiragana is far more common.  In fact,  when not attached to a verb, 簡単 (kantan) is almost always preferred.",
  "etymology": "The word やすい comes from the kanji 易い (yasui).  易 (yasu) means \"easy\" and い (-i) is the adjectival suffix. The semantic connection to ease and simplicity is clear. The pronunciation remains consistently 'yasui', regardless of whether it is written in kanji or hiragana.  Note that the kanji is rarely encountered in modern Japanese.",
