    "etymology": "The particle 「って」 is a colloquial variant of the more formal particle 「と」, used to mark quotations or content.",
    "writeup": "「って」 is a casual version of the 「と」 particle when it's used to quote something. In Japanese, this is called 「引用 (in'yō)」, meaning \"reference\" or \"citation.\" 「って」 almost always follows direct quotations and is succeeded by a verb indicating the mode of communication, like 「言った (itta)」 (said), 「思った (omotta)」 (thought), or 「聞いた (kiita)」 (heard).\n\nJust like with 「と」, the verb that follows 「って」 is often omitted, and this is even more common with 「って」 because casual language tends to omit things.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nBecause 「って」 is very casual, it can sound unnatural in sentences using polite structures like 「です」 or 「ます」. However, if the conversation is formal but friendly (e.g., between a 「先輩 (senpai)」 and a 「後輩 (kōhai)」), most people would consider it normal. It's also used often in 「若者言葉 (wakamono kotoba)」 or youth slang.",
