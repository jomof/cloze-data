    "writeup": "Much like 「聞こえる」 describes things that are 'audible', 「見える」 describes things that are 'visible'. 「見える」 itself is an intransitive verb; the object that is 'visible' is marked with 「が」. Thus, (A) will always be followed by 「が」. However, the 'way that something looks' will be marked adverbially. This means that an い-adjective will change to its く form, and な-adjectives/nouns will be followed by 「に」. A focused lesson will further cover this usage of 「見える」.\n\nThe primary difference between 「見える」 and 「見られる」(the potential form of 「見る」), is that 「見える」 identifies things seen without active concentration. In other words, seeing it is unavoidable (if looking in its direction, of course). However, 「見られる」 is used when the onlooker tries to concentrate on a specific object, referring to their 'ability' to see it.\n\n「見える」 is also sometimes used to describe the 'sense' of sight, referring to whether anything is visible at all for the speaker.",
    "etymology": "The kanji 見 means \"to see\" or \"to view.\"  The verb 「見える」 evolved from the potential form of 「見る」, gradually becoming an independent verb with the meaning of \"to be visible\" or \"to come into view.\"",
