  "writeup": "にて is a formal particle, often considered a single unit despite its origins as a combination of に and て.  It functions similarly to で, indicating location, means, method, time, reason, or origin.  The key difference is formality; にて is significantly more formal and less common in everyday speech than で. You'll find にて primarily in written Japanese or formal announcements.  Think of it as the 'dressy' version of で.  Choosing the appropriate particle hinges on context and desired level of formality.  In casual conversation, で is overwhelmingly preferred.",
  "etymology": "The particle にて originates from the combination of the particle に (marking location, time, indirect object, etc.) and the conjunctive particle て (indicating the continuation of an action or state). The combination produces a more formal and literary nuance compared to simply using に or で.",
