    "writeup": "The particle 「だって」 adds the nuance of \"too\" or \"even\" to the word it follows. It suggests that something is true not only of others but also of the subject in question. It can also be used with *wh*-words (誰, 何, いつ, どこ, etc.) to mean \"anyone\", \"anything\", \"anytime\", \"anywhere\", etc. \n\nEtymologically, 「だって」is related to the sentence-ending particle 「だ」and 「と」, indicating a quote or reason.",
    "etymology": "The 「だって」 particle is derived from 「だ」 (a copula indicating affirmation or assertion) and 「と」 (a particle indicating a quote or reason), combined with the emphatic 「て」.  The underlying concept is similar to saying something like \"because it *is* said that...\" or \"even if it *is* the case that...\", implying that something is true even under certain conditions.",
