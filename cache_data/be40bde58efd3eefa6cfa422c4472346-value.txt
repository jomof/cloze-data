  "writeup": "The particle 気 (ki), meaning \"feeling,\" \"spirit,\" or \"mind,\" modifies verbs to express a sense of inclination or feeling towards an action.  It's often translated as \"feel like\" or \"have a mind to.\"  Think of it as describing the mental state preceding an action.  The nuance shifts depending on the verb and its conjugation. For example,  やる気がない (yaru ki ga nai) means \"I don't feel like doing it,\" while やる気がある (yaru ki ga aru) means \"I feel like doing it.\"  Understanding the subtle differences requires careful attention to context and verb conjugation. This grammatical element is versatile and adds depth to expressing intentions and feelings.",
  "etymology": "The character 気 (ki) itself is rich in meaning. It's composed of the radical 气 (ki), representing breath or vapor, and 心 (shin), meaning heart or mind.  This beautifully illustrates the connection between breath, inner feelings, and mental disposition, which are all reflected in the nuances of this grammatical particle.",
