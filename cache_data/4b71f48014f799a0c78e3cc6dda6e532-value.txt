  "writeup": "The adverb ずっと has two primary meanings in Japanese. The first, which we'll focus on here, indicates that something continues in a constant state without interruption. The second emphasizes the extent or quantity of something.  To use ずっと in its continuous sense, place it at the beginning of the phrase describing the ongoing action or state.  Alternatively, ずっと can follow から to express that something has been continuing 'ever since' a specific event or point in time.  \"Fun fact:\" ずっと literally means 'unwavering' or 'unfaltering,' so the statement it modifies always implies a significant or maximal degree of the described action or state.",
  "etymology": "The word ずっと comes from the older form  『ずと』, which itself is derived from the verb  『ずっ』 (to be firm or unwavering).  This reflects the core meaning of continuous, uninterrupted action or state.",
