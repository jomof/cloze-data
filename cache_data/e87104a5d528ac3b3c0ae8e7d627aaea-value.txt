    "writeup": "やや is an adverb used to express a slight degree, marginal difference, or a tendency that is present but not overwhelming. It conveys the nuance that something possesses a quality to a degree that cannot be ignored, yet it is not significant enough to be considered strong or pronounced. やや often appears at the beginning of a sentence or before the word it modifies. It is suitable for formal and semi-formal contexts, often used in descriptive or explanatory writing and speech.",
