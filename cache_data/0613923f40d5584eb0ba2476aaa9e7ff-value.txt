    "etymology": "The origin of 好き (suki) is not definitively known, but it is believed to be related to the verb 好く (suku), which means \"to like\" or \"to prefer.\" Over time, 好く evolved into the noun-like adjective 好き, retaining its core meaning of fondness or preference.",
    "writeup": "好き (suki), meaning \"to like\", is a very common *na*-adjective in Japanese used in many different expressions. Like all *na*-adjectives, its form changes depending on what follows it. When 好き acts as an adjective, it is followed by な. When acting as a noun, it's followed by either だ (plain form) or です (polite form). This distinction depends on whether it's linked to another noun or stands independently.\n\nWhen using だ, 好き expresses that something is \"likable\" (assertion). However, when using な, 好き expresses \"likability\" as a quality of the noun it modifies.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   好き is considered a strong adjective in Japanese when directed towards people and may be interpreted as romantic interest. 大好き (daisuki) is often translated as \"love\".\n*   Because 好き is a な-adjective, remember it behaves like a noun; it can be followed by particles like 「が」 or 「は」 to indicate the subject.
