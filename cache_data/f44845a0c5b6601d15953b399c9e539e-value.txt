  "writeup": "The suffix ぐるみ, following nouns, means \"including (A),\" \"all over (A),\" or \"(A)-wide.\" It expresses that something encompasses all of (A).  It stems from the u-verb 包む (tsutsumu), meaning \"to wrap\" or \"to encompass.\"  Frequently, the particle で follows ぐるみ, indicating \"with.\" However, の can also be used before a second noun.  ぐるみ is most often used with words specifying a group or span, of which the sentence's topic is only one part—a family member, a house in a neighborhood, a student in a school, etc.  The crucial nuance is that the group shares a common trait, not the focus on individual parts. This is a sophisticated grammatical point, best suited for advanced learners.",
