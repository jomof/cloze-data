    "writeup": "**君 (kun)** is a suffix primarily attached to the names of males. It conveys familiarity or a slightly informal tone. It's often used by superiors to subordinates, between male peers, or when addressing young boys. While predominantly used for males, it can be used by males toward females of lower status or by female students toward males of equal or lower status in specific contexts like schools or companies. It is less polite than さん but warmer than 呼び捨て (yobisute, addressing someone by their name alone).",
