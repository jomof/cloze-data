  "writeup": "さすが, often written in kanji as 流石, is an adverb expressing admiration for something or someone meeting expectations.  It conveys a sense of 'as one would expect' or 'that's just like…'.  The positive connotation is primary, highlighting the subject's skill, competence, or characteristic behavior.  It can modify verbs, adjectives, or even entire clauses. While usually positive,  in rare cases, さすが can have a negative implication, akin to \"even,\" suggesting that even a highly capable person failed.  This usage contrasts sharply with its standard positive application.  The kanji 流石 is interesting etymologically; it's a 'borrowed character' (借字, shakuji), meaning the kanji components don't directly relate to the word's meaning. This is a common phenomenon in Japanese, highlighting the language's unique evolution.",
  "etymology": "The kanji 流石 (ryūseki) literally means 'flowing stone,' a seemingly unrelated image. Its usage as さすが is an example of 借字 (shakuji), where a kanji is used phonetically for a word with an unrelated meaning. The origin of this usage is debated, but it likely stems from the historical association of flowing water with natural, effortless accomplishment.",
