    "writeup": "で is a particle with several uses in Japanese. It highlights something essential for performing an action. When referring to places, it translates to \"at\" or \"in.\" The place is considered necessary for the action to occur or for the result to be achieved.\n\nIt contrasts with the particle に, which marks the location as the destination or target of an action. で indicates that the place allows the action to occur, while に indicates that the place is the target of the action.",
