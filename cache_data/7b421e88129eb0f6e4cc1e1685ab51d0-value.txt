    "etymology": "はともかく uses the particle は (topic marker) and 兎も角 (ともかく), an adverb meaning \"to set aside\" or \"at any rate.\" 兎も角 is thought to come from the Buddhist expression 兎角亀毛 (とかくきもう), meaning \"horns on rabbits, fur on turtles,\" referring to nonexistent things. Though the connection is debated, it shares a sense of something being unimportant or irrelevant.",
    "writeup": "**はともかく** is used to shift the topic from one thing (A) to another (B), or to mention (B) as an additional point on top of (A). It often implies that (A) is not worth considering or making an issue of compared to (B). It typically follows nouns directly. The adverb 兎も角 (tomokaku) itself means \"anyway\" or \"at any rate.\"",
