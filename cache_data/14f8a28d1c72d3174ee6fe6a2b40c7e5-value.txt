  "etymology": "The word 却って (kaette) comes from the verb 却く (ka-ku), meaning \"to retreat\" or \"to turn back.\"  The particle て indicates a continuous or consequential action.  Therefore, 却って suggests a reversal or unexpected outcome, highlighting the contrast between expectation and reality. The nuance of 'stepping back' from an initial statement to reveal a different, often undesirable, consequence is inherent in its etymology.",
  "writeup": "The adverb 却って (kaette) conveys an unexpected or contrary result.  It's often used to express that an action intended to achieve a certain outcome has had the opposite effect.  Think of it as adding a twist to the narrative.  You might use it to indicate that an attempt to improve a situation actually worsened it, or an act of kindness was unintentionally misinterpreted. It's generally considered formal, hence its use in business or professional settings. The word carries a strong nuance of unintended consequences or irony, adding a layer of sophistication to your expression.  While a simple translation might be 'on the contrary' or 'instead,'  understanding its deeper implication is key to using it correctly.  While its use isn't explicitly gender-specific, due to its formal nature, it might be more commonly used by older generations or in more formal situations.",

      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses \"手伝おうとした\" (tried to help), a volitional form which adds a nuance of effort and intention, making the unexpected negative outcome ('邪魔になった') more impactful.  The simple structure and neutral tone make it suitable for various situations, though it leans towards semi-formal due to the grammar point itself."

    {
      "japanese": "彼女を喜ばせようとしたのに、**却って**悲しませてしまった。",
      "english": "I tried to make her happy, but it ended up making her sad instead.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of \"彼女\" (kanojo) and the casual verb conjugation \"喜ばせようとした\" (tried to make her happy) show a relaxed tone and close relationship between the speaker and the listener. The apologetic setting comes from the unexpected negative outcome described with '却って'."

      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence is short, simple, and straightforward, reflective of someone thinking back on a situation. The casual nature of the verb '注意しようとした' (tried to be careful) fits this setting."

      "japanese": "簡潔に説明しようとした**却って**誤解を招いた。",
      "english": "Trying to explain concisely, on the contrary, I invited misunderstanding.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal register is due to the use of '却って' and the formal sentence structure.  The phrase '簡潔に説明しようとした' (tried to explain concisely) shows a professional approach, highlighting the irony that the intent was good but the result was not. This combination renders the sentence suitable for a formal, apologetic setting."

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register and the phrase \"冗談を言ったつもりだった\" (I meant it as a joke) indicate a relaxed conversational tone, while the unexpected negative outcome with '却って' creates a melancholic atmosphere.  It showcases the speaker's regret."

      "setting": "humorous",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The simple structure and common experience of taking a shortcut and the unexpected outcome make this suitable for a casual, humorous setting. The use of \"しようとしたら\" (when I tried to) adds a nuance of an action attempt that failed, increasing the humorous effect."

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of \"…\" (ellipsis) adds a feeling of frustration and disappointment, appropriate for a melancholic setting. The phrase \"もっと綺麗にしようとした\" (I tried to make it cleaner), combined with the unexpected negative result, emphasizes the speaker's failed attempt. The use of  「もっと綺麗にしようとした」 (I tried to make it more beautiful) is more commonly used by women."
