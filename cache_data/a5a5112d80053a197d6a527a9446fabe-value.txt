  "writeup": "聞こえる (kikoeru) is a versatile intransitive verb primarily used to describe sounds that are perceived passively, without active effort.  Its most common translations are \"to be audible,\" \"to sound (like),\" or \"to be heard.\"  The subject of the sentence is the *source* of the sound, typically marked with が.  Adverbs, or the -く form of い-adjectives and な-adjectives/nouns followed by に, modify how the sound is perceived.  Crucially, 聞こえる differs from 聞ける (kikeru, the potential form of 聞く - kiku), which implies active listening and the ability to hear something specific.  聞こえる generally refers to sounds that are passively perceived, like ambient noise. This subtle distinction is a key aspect of mastering this grammar point.  Understanding this nuanced difference between passively perceiving a sound and actively trying to hear a sound is vital for accurate usage.  Let's explore its usage through various examples.",
  "etymology": "The verb 聞こえる is etymologically related to the verb 聞く (kiku), meaning \"to hear.\"  However, while historically a conjugation of 聞く,  modern Japanese treats 聞こえる as a distinct intransitive verb. Its development reflects the language's evolution in focusing on the passive reception of sound rather than the active act of listening.",

The phrase 「私の心に優しく」(watashi no kokoro ni yasashiku) adds a romantic, almost shy, nuance. The younger female speaker is expressing her feelings delicately to the older male listener. The indirectness of the compliment shows sensitivity and respect."
