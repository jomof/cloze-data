    "etymology": "This grammar point simply combines an い-adjective with a noun. The い-adjective directly modifies the noun, similar to how adjectives function in English. There are no hidden layers to the etymology.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, い-adjectives can directly modify nouns by preceding them. This is similar to how adjectives function in English. The い-adjective is used in its dictionary form, placed directly before the noun it describes.  \n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   When identifying い-adjectives, remember that the い is always outside of any kanji in the word.  However, the reverse is not always true for な-adjectives.\n    *   Example: 「面白い」 - The い is outside the kanji, indicating that 'interesting' is an い-adjective.\n    *   Example: 「綺麗」 - The い is inside the kanji, indicating that 'clean' is a な-adjective.\n\n*   There are exceptions. For example, 「嫌い」 (kirai - hate) is a な-adjective, even though the い is outside the kanji.  Such exceptions are rare.",
