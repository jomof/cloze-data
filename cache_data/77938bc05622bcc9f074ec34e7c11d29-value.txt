    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the verb 「至る(いたる)」(itaru), meaning \"to reach, arrive at, lead to.\" The 「に」 (ni) marks the starting point or scope, and 「は」 (wa) indicates the topic or focus. Thus, 「に至っては」 (ni itatte wa) literally means \"having arrived at (a particular point),\" implying a focus on that specific extreme case.",
    "writeup": "「に至っては」 (ni itatte wa) presents an extreme example within a category. It translates to \"when it comes to (A), (B),\" \"as for (A), (B),\" or \"in particular (A), (B).\" It emphasizes the extremity of the example, often highlighting something surprising or unfavorable. It follows nouns or nominalized phrases.\n\nBecause the verb 「至る」 (itaru) indicates reaching an extreme point, 「に至っては」 (ni itatte wa) typically introduces surprising or negative examples.",
