It expresses a sense of contrast, concession, or qualification between the two clauses, often translating to \"but,\" \"however,\" or \"although\" in English. It's similar to が, but more casual. The phrase after けど may sometimes be omitted if the context is clear or the speaker wishes to be indirect.",
