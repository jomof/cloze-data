    "etymology": "The particle を originates from the verb 乎 (wo), which meant 'to call out' or 'to indicate.' Over time, it grammaticalized into a particle used to mark the direct object of a verb.",
    "writeup": "The particle を marks the **direct object** of a transitive verb. This means the subject of the sentence is performing an action *on* something. Think of it as indicating \"what\" is being acted upon. For example, in \"I eat an apple,\" 'apple' is the direct object marked by を in Japanese.\n\nHowever, を can also indicate the **place** where an action occurs, especially with verbs of motion. This is common when the action involves movement within or across a location. It highlights the interaction with the place itself, such as walking *through* a park.",
