    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とは限らない」 combines 「と」, a particle indicating content or result, 「は」, a topic marker, and 「限らない」, the negative form of the verb 「限る (かぎる)」, meaning \"to limit\". Thus, it literally means \"it is not limited to that\", implying that something is not always the case or guaranteed.",
    "writeup": "「とは限らない」 is used to express that something is \"not necessarily so\" or that \"there is no guarantee that\" something is true. The expression utilizes the case-marking particle 「と」 to highlight a result, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negated form of the verb 「限る (かぎる)」, meaning \"to limit\". Therefore, while 「と」 highlights a result, that result is then being clarified as \"not the only possibility\". This structure can be used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns. However, 「だ」 is required after な-adjectives and nouns.",
