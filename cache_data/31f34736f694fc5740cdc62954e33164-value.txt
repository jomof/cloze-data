    "writeup": "ぜ is an emphatic sentence-ending particle in Japanese, similar to よ. It adds emphasis to the speaker's statement but carries a slightly less forceful tone than particles like ぞ.  ぜ is appended to the plain form of verbs, adjectives, and auxiliary verbs. When used with nouns or na-adjectives, it follows the auxiliary verb だ. This particle is predominantly used by men and is typically directed towards individuals with whom the speaker shares a close or familiar relationship. While often conveying a sense of friendliness, ぜ can also be used when addressing a rival or someone in a similar dynamic. This contrasts with ぞ, which can be used more broadly.  \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Gender:** Primarily used by men.\n*   **Formality:** Used in casual settings.\n*   **Nuance:** Conveys emphasis with a friendly or familiar tone.\n\n**Etymology Fun Fact:**  The particle ぜ is believed to have originated from the combination of ぞ and え.  え is an older, less common variant of the sentence-ending particle い, which appears in forms like だい and かい.  Because い inherently carries a friendly or familiar nuance, ぜ retains this feeling. Over time, ぞえ evolved into ぜ, becoming a distinct particle in its own right.",
