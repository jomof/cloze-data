        "pronunciation_warning": "The grammar point can be read as either 'uru' or 'eru'. 'Uru' is an older form and less common in everyday speech, but is often preferred when the preceding kana is 'e', such as in '教えうる' (oshieuru)."

    "etymology": "得る (eru/uru) originally means \"to obtain\" or \"to gain.\" The auxiliary verb usage extends this meaning to indicate the possibility of \"gaining\" a certain state or outcome. The form 「あり得る」 (ariuru), meaning \"possible,\" is a common example where the verb 「ある」 (aru, to exist) combines with 「得る」 to express the potential for existence or occurrence.",
    "writeup": "得る is a る-verb meaning \"to gain\" or \"to acquire.\" When attached to the ます-stem of a verb, it takes on the nuance of \"for (A) to be possible\" or \"to be able to (A).\" Compared to できる, which means that the potential to do something exists, 得る means something closer to \"there is a possibility that (A) can be done\" or \"the possibility to do (A) has been gained.\"\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   得る may be seen as either える or うる. うる is a relatively old form often seen in literature and spoken less frequently than える. Despite this, there is a tendency for うる to be the preferred spoken choice when the kana that appears before it is え, such as 教える becoming 教えうる, rather than 教ええる.\n*   得る is far more formal/bookish than できる. However, several set phrases are very common in daily speech that use this grammar point, such as あり得る (\"possible\") and あり得ない (\"impossible\").",
