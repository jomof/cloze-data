    "writeup": "**わ～わ** is an adverbial particle construction used to emphasize the large quantity or continuous occurrence of an action. It's formed by repeating a verb in its dictionary form, each followed by the particle わ. This structure conveys a sense of **surprise** or **exaggeration** regarding the extent or frequency of something. It can be translated as \"more and more,\" \"keeps on happening,\" or \"so much.\" While often used in situations expressing a large quantity, it can be used for both positive and negative situations. Notably, when used with a する verb, the second instance of the verb is often omitted, resulting in the pattern **[verb stem]するわするわ**.  Historically, わ is considered an emphatic form of the adverbial particle は, intensifying its meaning of \"as for.\"  Therefore, the literal sense can be interpreted as a strong assertion of the action, like saying \"as for (A), it really did (A).\" This grammar point is predominantly used by men, but women may also use it.",
