    "writeup": "The grammar point **よりほかない** (yori hoka nai) is used to express that there is **no alternative** or **no other option** but to do a certain action.  It conveys a sense of resignation or inevitability.  The structure attaches directly to the dictionary form of a verb.\n\nLiterally, より (yori) means \"than\", 他 (hoka) means \"other\", and ない (nai) means \"not\". So, the literal meaning is something like \"there is nothing other than...\", but the nuance emphasizes the lack of other options.\n\nIt's similar in meaning to **しかない (shika nai)**, but よりほかない tends to have a more formal or emphatic tone.\n\n*   You can also sometimes see variations like **よりほかしかたがない** or **よりほかしかたなかった** which carry a similar meaning of having no other choice or it can't be helped.\n*   The past tense form, **よりほかなかった**, is used to describe situations where there was no other choice in the past.",
