  "writeup": "The grammar point \"に相違ない\" (ni soui nai) is a formal expression used to emphatically state certainty or lack of doubt.  It translates to \"without a doubt,\" \"certainly,\" \"surely,\" or \"no mistake.\"  It's constructed from the noun 相違 (soui, difference, discrepancy) and the negative adjective ない (nai).  The phrase literally means \"there is no discrepancy.\"  This construction is primarily used in formal settings and written language.  Its close relative, \"に違いない\" (ni chigai nai), is a less formal and more frequently used alternative.  \"に相違ない\" is often followed by the particle から (kara, because), emphasizing the causal relationship underpinning the certainty. While 相違 can stand alone meaning 'to differ' or 'a discrepancy,'  within this phrase, it functions as part of a fixed expression.",
  "etymology": "The phrase is built upon 相違 (soui), meaning 'difference' or 'discrepancy,' and ない (nai), the negative form of the verb ある (aru, to exist). The combination signifies the absence of any difference or doubt. The use of に (ni) marks the preceding element as the object of certainty.",
