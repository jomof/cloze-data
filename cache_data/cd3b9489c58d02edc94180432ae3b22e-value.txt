    "writeup": "「で言うと」 is a Japanese expression used to draw comparisons or offer a specific point of view. It combines the particle 「で」 (indicating means or context) with 「言うと」 (meaning \"if said\" or \"if we say\"). The structure is typically seen after nouns and can be translated as \"if said with (A), (B)\" or \"in terms of (A), (B)\".\n\nOften, 「で言うと」 is used in sentences with 「に当たる」 (\"to be equivalent to\"), another grammar structure that connects two different things.\n\n**Important Note:** 「一言で言うと」 is a fixed expression meaning \"to put it in a word,\" \"in short,\" or \"to sum up.\"",
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「で言うと」 comes from combining the particle 「で」, indicating the context or means by which something is stated, with the conditional form 「言うと」 of the verb 「言う」 (to say). Thus, it literally means \"if one were to say in the context of\" or \"in terms of.\"",
