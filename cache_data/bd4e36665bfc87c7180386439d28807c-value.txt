  "writeup": "とあって is a formal grammar expression combining the case-marking particle と with the て-form of ある 'to be'. It's used to present an unusual situation leading to an obvious result.  We often translate it as 'since (A), it's no wonder that (B)', or 'because of (A), it's natural that (B)'.  とあって usually follows words in their standard forms, but な-adjectives need a だ between them and とあって.  Think of it as similar to として 'as', but with a stronger focus on 'what (A) is or is perceived as', emphasized by ある, rather than 'how (A) acts', emphasized by する.  **Important Consideration:** とあって is used objectively; it doesn't refer to the speaker or writer.",
  "etymology": "The structure of とあって is straightforward.  It's a combination of the particle と, indicating a circumstantial element or reason, and the て-form of the verb ある (to be/exist), suggesting a state of being that naturally leads to the consequence described in the following clause. The て-form connects the cause and effect, showing a natural progression. The formality stems from the use of ある in its て-form, which carries a degree of stiffness that isn't present in more colloquial sentence structures.",
