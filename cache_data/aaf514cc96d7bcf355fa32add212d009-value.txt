  "writeup": "ていては is a grammatical structure commonly used with verbs to express the consequence of repeatedly performing an action.  It often implies a negative or undesirable outcome.  The structure combines the て-form of a verb, いる (to be) in its て-form (いて), and は. The combination ていては functions as a conjunctive structure expressing hypothetical scenarios or repetitive actions, resulting in a nuanced meaning.  It's crucial to understand that the meaning subtly shifts depending on the verb used.  The て-form indicates the continuation of the action, while は adds emphasis and a sense of consequence.  Interestingly, the ては in ていては is the same as in other negative conjunctive structures like てはいけない, てはならない, and てはだめ, although those are explicitly negative.",
  "etymology": "The structure arises from the combination of the continuous aspect marked by the て-form + いる and the conjunctive particle は, which in this context signals a conditional or consequential relationship.  The 'te' form expresses the continuous action, while 'wa' sets the condition or circumstance.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "毎日お菓子ばかりを食べていては、いつまで経っても痩せませんよ。",
      "english": "If you keep only eating snacks, you'll never lose any weight.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The politeness marker 「よ」 softens the statement, making it suitable for a friendly or slightly condescending interaction between peers or from an older person to a younger one. The sentence structure clearly illustrates the consequence of continued snack eating, a point made emphatically with the use of 「いつまで経っても」."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "毎晩遊んでいては、お金がたまりませんよ。",
      "english": "If you keep playing every night, you won't save money.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of  「よ」 again adds a touch of politeness but also suggests a slightly cautionary tone, making it suitable for a friend or acquaintance offering advice."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の事をいつも考えていては、前に進めないよ。",
      "english": "If you keep thinking about him, you won't move on.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "supportive",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual 「よ」 makes this suitable for close friends offering consolation.  The focus is on the continuous thought process—『いつも考えていては』—that prevents forward movement."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "そんなに彼に甘えていては、彼はあなたを甘やかすだけだよ。",
      "english": "If you keep being so dependent on him, he'll just spoil you.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a female-to-female conversation, evident in the casual tone and the use of 「だけだよ」. The phrase 「そんなに彼に甘えていては」suggests a playful teasing of the listener's dependence."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ずっと彼のことを考えていては、新しい恋は始められないよ。",
      "english": "If you keep thinking about him, you won't be able to start a new romance.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual 「よ」is used here in a supportive, friendly manner.  The male speaker is gently guiding the female listener towards moving on, with the phrase 「ずっと彼のことを考えていては」clearly indicating the reason why she cannot move forward with a new relationship."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この調子で働き続けていては、体を壊してしまうぞ。",
      "english": "If you keep working like this, you'll ruin your health!",

      "setting": "serious",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「ぞ」indicates a strong emphasis and warning, which is typical from an older person toward a younger one to express concern.  The phrase 「この調子で働き続けていては」shows the urgency of the situation, implying a negative consequence from continued work."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the negative consequence is often implicit. The focus is on the continuous action and its likely, undesirable result.  The nuance can change subtly depending on context and the verb used. Mastering this structure will elevate your Japanese fluency significantly.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "ては",
      "meaning": "If, With, Since, Because",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike ていては, which emphasizes the continuation of an action leading to a consequence, ては indicates a more general conditional relationship, without necessarily implying continuous action or a negative outcome."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the emphasis on continuous action. ていては highlights the ongoing nature of the action and its resulting consequence, while ては presents a broader conditional relationship.  Context is crucial; if you intend to emphasize the repetitive nature of the action and its consequences, use ていては; otherwise, ては might suffice."
