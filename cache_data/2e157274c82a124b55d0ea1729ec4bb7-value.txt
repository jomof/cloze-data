  "writeup": "The particle 以上 (ijō) means \"more than\" or \"above.\"  When combined with に (ni), creating 以上に (ijō ni), it intensifies the meaning, suggesting a degree exceeding expectations or a standard.  This phrase is typically attached to nouns, adjectives (both い-adjectives and な-adjectives), and verbs in their dictionary forms.  The particle に marks the element being surpassed.  For example, \"予想以上に (yōsō ijō ni)\" means \"more than expected.\"  It's a versatile structure useful in expressing surprise, admiration, or disappointment regarding the extent of something.",
  "etymology": "以上 (ijō) itself combines 以 (i) meaning 'by' or 'using' and 上 (jō) meaning 'above' or 'superior.'  The combination suggests something surpassing a limit or standard.  The addition of に (ni) further emphasizes the directional aspect of exceeding that limit, focusing on the degree to which the standard is surpassed.",
