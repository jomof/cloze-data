  "writeup": "て見せる, usually written in hiragana, is an emphatic structure expressing the speaker's determination to accomplish something.  It conveys a strong sense of resolve, promising a definite outcome.  Think of it as \"I'll show you,\" \"I'll definitely,\" or \"I swear I will.\" The nuance emphasizes the demonstrative aspect—the speaker's action will be clearly evident. To use this, simply conjugate the preceding verb to its て-form and add 見せる (miseru).  Important Considerations:  Because 見せる (miseru) implies showing someone, this construction works best when there's an implied or explicit audience for the action.  The emphasis isn't solely on the act itself but on proving it to someone.  While you *can* use it without a clear audience, it implies that the speaker intends for their actions to be demonstrably clear to everyone. The etymology of みせる (miseru) comes from 見せる (miseru), meaning 'to show'.  The て-form indicates the preceding action and combines to create this emphatic expression of determination.",
  "etymology": "The grammar point's core, 見せる (miseru), derives from the verb 見せる (miseru), meaning \"to show.\" The て-form preceding it describes the action being emphatically demonstrated.",
