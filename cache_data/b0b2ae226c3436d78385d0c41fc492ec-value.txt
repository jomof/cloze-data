  "writeup": "The adverb つい, typically placed at the beginning of a sentence, translates to 'accidentally,' 'unconsciously,' 'absentmindedly,' or 'against one's better judgment.'  It's frequently paired with てしまう to emphasize unintentional actions.  While often translated as 'accidentally,' つい carries subtle nuances: はからず (uncalculated), も思わず (unthought-of), and 距離がわずかなさま (a small gap/interval).  In all cases,  つい highlights the fleeting nature of the action, akin to a 'lapse' in judgment, time, or forethought.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of つい is complex and not definitively settled. Some scholars suggest it's related to the verb ついやす (to urge, to push), implying a subtle pressure leading to the unintentional action. Others connect it to the concept of closeness or proximity (距離がわずかなさま), reflecting the immediate nature of the event. More research is needed for a definitive conclusion.",
