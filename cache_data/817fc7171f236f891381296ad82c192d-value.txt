  "writeup": "そういえば is a common Japanese phrase used as a conversational transition.  It literally translates to something like \"if you say that,\" or \"speaking of that,\" but its function is closer to English expressions like \"speaking of which,\" \"by the way,\" or \"come to think of it.\"  It signals a shift in topic, often referencing something previously mentioned in the conversation.  It's crucial to understand that, unlike the English \"by the way,\"  そういえば implies a connection to the preceding conversation. You wouldn't use it to abruptly introduce an entirely unrelated subject.  The structure itself combines そう (sou, 'like that') and the ば-form (conditional) of 言う (iu, 'to say').  This reflects its function of connecting the current statement to a prior remark.  It's a useful phrase for creating a natural flow in conversations, adding a subtle yet effective nuance.",

  "etymology": "The phrase そういえば (sou ieba) is a combination of そう (sou), meaning 'like that' or 'so,' and 言えば (ieba), the conditional form of 言う (iu), meaning 'to say.'  The conditional form implies a conditional relationship—'if one were to say that...'—leading to the nuanced meaning of referencing a prior conversation.",

    {
      "term": "といえば",
      "meaning": "Speaking of, If it were the case that",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "といえば (to ieba) is similar but can be used more broadly to introduce a topic related to something just mentioned, without the same emphasis on previous conversation."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the implied connection to the preceding conversation. そういえば (sou ieba) strongly suggests a direct link, while ところで (tokoro de) and といえば (to ieba) are more general transitions.  Choose そういえば (sou ieba) when you want to explicitly reference something already discussed."
