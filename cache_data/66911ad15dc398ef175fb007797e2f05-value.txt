    "etymology": "「大体」 literally means \"large body\" or \"main body\". This reflects its core meaning of representing the main or essential part of something.",
    "writeup": "**大体 (だいたい)** is an adverb with several related meanings, all revolving around the idea of the main or essential aspect of something.  It commonly translates to \"mostly\", \"generally\", or \"for the most part\", indicating a majority or a typical occurrence.  You can use **だいたい** to modify entire phrases or place **大体の** directly before a noun, similar to other adverbs of quantity.

    Interestingly, **だいたい** can also express the nuance of \"in the first place\", much like **そもそも (somosomo)**. In this usage, the sentence often highlights a discrepancy between an expected or desired outcome and the actual situation.

    While these two primary uses might seem distinct, they both stem from the core concept of what is fundamentally correct or the norm.  Think of it as expressing the state of something without significant alterations.

    **Important Considerations:**

    *   When used to mean \"mostly\" or \"generally\", **だいたい** suggests that there might be minor exceptions or variations.
    *   When used to mean \"in the first place\", **だいたい** often carries a tone of annoyance, disbelief, or questioning the premise of a situation.
