  "etymology": "This grammar point is built upon the verb 応える (kotaete), meaning \"to answer\" or \"to respond.\" The 'ni' particle marks the preceding noun as the target of the response, and the '-te' form indicates the action of responding. The overall structure shows the action being done in response to something else.",
  "writeup": "The grammar point \"に応えて\" (ni kotaete) is a versatile construction used to express actions or responses taken in relation to something preceding it.  It literally translates to \"in response to\" or \"by responding to,\" but its nuance often goes beyond a simple causal relationship.  It implies a sense of fulfilling a need, expectation, or request.  The preceding noun marked with \"ni\" is the stimulus, and the following verb describes the action taken in direct response.  Think of it as indicating a reactive or adaptive behavior rather than a mere consequence.  This expression is generally applicable across most registers and contexts.",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key distinction between に応えて and に応じて lies in the specificity of the response.  にこたえて implies a direct, deliberate reaction to a known stimulus, whereas によって is more about adjusting to a broader condition or circumstance.  Choosing the correct expression depends on the level of directness in the cause-and-effect relationship you wish to convey."
