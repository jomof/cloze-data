  "writeup": "The particle phrase をもとに (wo moto ni) means \"based on,\" \"from,\" or \"according to.\"  It's a versatile expression that connects a noun phrase indicating the source or basis of something to a following clause. The structure is simple:  [Noun] をもとに [Clause].  The core element 元 (moto) means \"origin.\" The particle を (wo) marks the noun as the direct object, indicating the source is the starting point.  The particle に (ni) indicates the means or manner.  Therefore, the phrase literally implies something like, \"using [noun] as the origin.\"  While often written in hiragana, it's perfectly acceptable to use kanji (を元に).  This phrase is typically used when discussing the source material or inspiration behind something, not just any source of information. For example, a work of fiction based on real events uses をもとに, not necessarily the evidence for a scientific conclusion.  This nuance is important to grasp.  There are several close synonyms, each with subtle differences, which we will address later.  Mastering をもとに will significantly enrich your descriptive abilities in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's core is 元 (moto), meaning \"origin.\"  Combining it with を (wo), marking the direct object, and に (ni), indicating the manner or means, creates a strong and precise expression of causation, where the first clause provides the underlying foundation for the action or state of the second.",
