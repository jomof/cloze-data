  "writeup": "に引き換え (ni hikikae) is a grammar pattern used to highlight a stark contrast between two things.  It's best translated as \"in comparison to (A), (B)\" or \"in stark contrast to (A), (B).\"  The literal meaning involves \"pulling back and switching away from (A), to (B),\" which emphasizes the significant difference.  This construction typically compares opposites, where one is viewed favorably and the other unfavorably, from the speaker's perspective.  Importantly, both (A) and (B) are observable facts, not assumptions or guesses.  Note that に引き換え can follow almost any word type, but requires の before い-adjectives or verbs, and なの before な-adjectives.  Moreover, それに引き換え (sore ni hikikae) can be used to initiate sentences comparing something to what was previously stated.  Mastering this nuance adds depth to your Japanese.",
  "etymology": "に引き換え is a compound structure.  に (ni) is the particle indicating a topic or point of comparison. 引き (hiki) is the stem of 引く (hiku), meaning \"to pull,\" suggesting a drawing back from one point.  換え (kae) is the stem of 換える (kaeru), meaning \"to exchange\" or \"to switch,\" indicating the shift to the contrasting point. The combination precisely captures the idea of a significant contrast.",
