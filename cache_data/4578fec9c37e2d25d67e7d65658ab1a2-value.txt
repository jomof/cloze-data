    "etymology": "全く (mattaku) comes from the kanji 全 (zen), meaning \"whole\" or \"entire.\" The grammar point uses 全く to emphasize the complete absence of something, negating it entirely.",
    "writeup": "**全く〜ない** combines the adverb 全く (mattaku) with the negative ない form of a verb or adjective. It expresses a strong negation, meaning "not at all." The literal sense is closer to "completely not" or "entirely not." 全く can be used at the beginning of a sentence or directly before the negated word. It's often written in both kanji (全く) and hiragana (まったく), so be familiar with both.

**Important Consideration:** 全く is similar to 全然 (zenzen), but 全く can sound more serious and is often used in more formal contexts, while 全然 is common in casual speech.",
