    "writeup": "まで is a particle that roughly means \"as far as.\" Due to this, when used with regular nouns or words that signify some kind of endpoint (a time or day), it is often translated as \"until,\" \"till,\" or \"to.\" When used in relation to a place, まで functions similarly to に. This means that someone or something will go \"to\" the place, but not any further. まで may also be used about points in time in the past, where \"up until\" would usually be used in English.",
