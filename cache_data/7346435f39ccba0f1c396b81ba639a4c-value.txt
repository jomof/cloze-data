  "writeup": "第一 (daiichi) is a Japanese expression functioning as both an adverb and a noun.  As a noun, it signifies 'foremost' or 'most important'. Adverbially, it means 'first' or 'above all'.  To use it adverbially, combine it with に (ni).  As a noun, it's usually followed by の (no) when connecting nouns, or the auxiliary verb だ (da) at the end of a sentence.  Sometimes, まず (mazu, 'first of all') is used with 第一, creating emphasis akin to 'the very first' in English.  The kanji 第 (dai) literally means 'position' within a sequence, not just 'number', making 第一 translate more accurately to '1st position'.",
  "etymology": "The term 第一 (daiichi) combines 第 (dai), meaning 'order' or 'position', and 一 (ichi), meaning 'one'.  This literally means 'first position' and reflects its grammatical function as an ordinal number indicator.",
