  "etymology": "The word あれ derives from a Proto-Japonic demonstrative pronoun.  Its development reflects the evolution of demonstrative systems in Japanese, shifting from a more geographically-based system to one that incorporates speaker-listener distance.",
  "writeup": "あれ, like これ and それ, is a demonstrative pronoun in Japanese, functioning as a substitute for nouns.  It translates roughly to 'that' in English, but crucially, it refers to something distant from both the speaker and the listener—'that over there'.  This distinction sets it apart from それ, which indicates something closer to the listener.  Remember to distinguish あれ from the colloquial interjection あれ, meaning 'huh?' or 'oh?', typically used as a response and spoken with a rising intonation. Context is key in differentiating these uses.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the spatial relationship between the speaker, listener, and the object being referred to.  Remember that あれ specifically highlights distance from both parties.  The use of あの as a modifier, as in あの建物, clarifies its function as a demonstrative adjective rather than a pronoun."
