    "etymology": "The expression 「たほうがいい」 is composed of 「た」, the past form of a verb, 「方 (hou)」 meaning \"direction\" or \"way,\" 「が (ga)」, a particle, and 「いい (ii)」 meaning \"good.\" The literal sense is that doing something is the \"better way.\"",
    "writeup": "「たほうがいい」 is a common way to express that something 'should' be done, especially when giving advice. The expression uses the past tense of a verb with 「方」, the particle 「が」, and the い-adjective 「いい」. Since 「方」 can be translated as \"way\" or \"direction\", this expression suggests that one specific choice is the better 'way'. This expression is quite direct and can imply negative consequences if the action is not taken. It can also be translated as \"It would be better if you did (A)\". Using the dictionary form of the verb with 「ほうがいい」 will sound more like a general opinion rather than direct advice.\n\nBecause this phrase is direct, using a more polite expression like 「ばいい」 is better for giving general advice.",
