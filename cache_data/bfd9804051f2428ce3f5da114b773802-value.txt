    "etymology": "The particle か originally indicated options or choices. It evolved to mark questions because asking a question implies offering possible answers.",
    "writeup": "か is a particle that is frequently placed at the end of sentences in Japanese, functioning similarly to a question mark in English. While most often found at the end of a sentence, it can appear elsewhere. In addition to marking questions, か can also express uncertainty or doubt. It often follows the polite form of words, such as 「〜ですか」 or 「〜ますか」. However, in casual conversation, か can directly follow the word the speaker is uncertain about. Both usages are grammatically correct, but omitting 「です」 may sound rude in some contexts, as it can come across as too direct.",
