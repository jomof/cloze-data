  "writeup": "The auxiliary verb \"べき\" (beki), the attributive form of \"べし\" (beshi), indicates a moral obligation or the most reasonable course of action.  It's derived from the kanji 可き (beki), meaning 'permissible,' implying that other actions are unacceptable.  \"べき\" is paired with the plain (non-past) form of a verb, followed by \"だ\" or a noun. While sometimes translated as 'must' or 'should,' it carries a strong nuance of permissibility.  **Important Consideration:** The verb with \"べき\" cannot be past tense.  Use \"だった\" (datta) or \"でした\" (deshita) after \"べき\" to express past obligation.  This grammatical structure, while often called an auxiliary verb, technically isn't one in modern Japanese.  It's considered classical, adding a layer of formality and emphasis to the sentence.  Interestingly,  the combination of \"する\" and \"べき\" is an exception, allowing both \"するべき\" and \"すべき\".",
  "etymology": "The word べき comes from the classical auxiliary verb べし (beshi), which itself is derived from the ancient verb べ (be), meaning \"to be.\"  The addition of the suffix -shi created the auxiliary form, indicating obligation or necessity. The modern usage of べき retains this core meaning of strong suggestion or obligation, though its grammatical function has evolved.",
