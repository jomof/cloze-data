  "writeup": "The word したがって (shitagatte) means \"therefore,\" \"thus,\" or \"as a result.\"  It's a formal conjunction used to indicate a logical consequence or conclusion following a previously stated cause.  Think of it as a more formal and slightly more nuanced version of だから (dakara).  While だから can often be used interchangeably, したがって implies a more direct causal relationship and a more deliberate, reasoned conclusion.  Its usage suggests a careful consideration of the preceding statement and its implications.  This makes it particularly appropriate for formal writing, academic papers, or business contexts.  The etymology is quite straightforward; it's the て-form of 従う (shitagau), meaning \"to obey\" or \"to follow,\" indicating that the subsequent clause is a logical consequence following the previous statement, like a chain of cause and effect.  Therefore, the use of したがって highlights the causal linkage between ideas more explicitly than だから.",

      "japanese": "現在東名高速の名古屋インターと岡崎インターの間でリニューアル工事が行われている。**したがって**、その区間は現在通行止めとなっている。",

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the formal register because it is providing factual information in a neutral and objective tone. The structure of the sentence, with the causal relationship clearly stated using したがって, further enhances the formal tone.  The language used is appropriate for an official announcement or report."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "今年は去年より台風が多かったです。**したがって**、今年の米の値段は去年より高くなるでしょう。",
      "english": "There were more typhoons this year than last year. **Therefore,** the price of rice this year will be higher than last year.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is semi-formal because the speaker is making a prediction based on past events rather than giving a formal report.  The use of したがって establishes the logical connection between the typhoon season and rice prices."

    {
      "japanese": "会社ではインフルエンザが流行っている。**したがって**、会議は全てオンラインで行われることになった。",
      "english": "The flu is going around in the company. **Therefore,** all meetings will be held online.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formality stems from the context (a company announcement) and the use of したがって to express the conclusion concisely and logically. The passive voice \"行われることになった\" (it was decided that...) adds to the formal tone."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "雨が二週間も続いた。**したがって**、川は氾濫する危険性がある。",
      "english": "It rained for two weeks. **Therefore,** there's a danger of the river flooding.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register is reflected in the shorter sentences and the simpler vocabulary.  The use of したがって is still appropriate to highlight the logical consequence, even in a casual conversation about a serious situation."

      "japanese": "彼の態度は傲慢だった。**したがって**、私は彼を信頼しない。",
      "english": "His attitude was arrogant. **Therefore,** I don't trust him.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence, despite being casual, employs したがって to make a clear statement, creating a stronger sense of conviction in the speaker's judgment.  The casualness comes from the straightforward expression of the speaker's personal opinion."

      "japanese": "君の笑顔が眩しい。**したがって**、僕は君に恋をしている。",
      "english": "Your smile is dazzling. **Therefore**, I'm in love with you.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The intimate register is created through the direct and affectionate expression of feelings.  The phrase 「君の笑顔が眩しい」(Your smile is dazzling) is a classic romantic trope, and the use of したがって, while formal in nature, creates a sense of earnest and considered romantic confession."

  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how したがって maintains a formal air even in informal settings. The choice depends heavily on the context and the desired level of formality.  It's a word that adds weight and precision to your conclusion.",

      "term": "その結果",
      "meaning": "As a result",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "その結果 is a more descriptive phrase, focusing on the outcome itself, whereas したがって emphasizes the logical link between cause and effect."

      "term": "だから (because)",
      "meaning": "Because, Since",

      "meaning": "As (one likes, feels or pleases), Spur of the moment, Wherever one fancies, Spontaneously, On a whim",

      "nuance": "ままに indicates something happening according to someone's will or the natural course of events, while したがって expresses a logical outcome stemming from a preceding action or fact."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the level of formality and the degree of causal relationship you want to convey.  For formal, reasoned conclusions, したがって is ideal.  For less formal contexts or when merely stating a result without explicitly highlighting causality, だから or even その結果 are more appropriate.  ままに indicates a different semantic meaning entirely, so it should be used carefully.  Choosing the right word will significantly improve the precision and naturalness of your Japanese."
