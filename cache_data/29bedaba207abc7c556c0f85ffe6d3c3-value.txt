    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed from the particle と (to), the verb 言う (iu, to say), and the passive form auxiliary verb れる/られる (reru/rareru) conjugated into its ている (teiru) form.  So, literally, it means something like \"it is in the state of being said.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **といわれている** translates to \"it is said that...\" or \"is known as...\".  Similar to **とされている**, it expresses a commonly held opinion or general knowledge. Both use the particle **と** followed by the passive form of a verb. In this case, the verb is **言う (いう)**, meaning \"to say\". However, a key difference is that **といわれている** emphasizes the act of something being \"quoted\" or \"said\", whereas **とされている** focuses on the \"result\" or established state. To use **といわれている**, simply attach it to the end of a phrase that represents something commonly said. You'll often see this grammar point written both with and without the kanji for **言う**, and the meaning remains the same.",
