  "writeup": "The negative past tense for る-verbs is formed by removing the final \"る\" and adding the appropriate negative past auxiliary verb.  This depends on the level of politeness required.  The casual form uses \"なかった\", while the polite form uses \"ませんでした\".  Interestingly, a semi-polite form, \"なかったです\", is also widely used despite not being strictly grammatically correct. Its prevalence amongst native speakers makes it practically acceptable in many situations.  Mastering these nuances is key to natural-sounding Japanese.",

  "etymology": "The negative past forms are derived from the combination of the verb stem and the negative past auxiliary verbs.  \"Nakatta\" (なかった) comes from \"nai\" (ない) meaning \"not\" and the past tense marker.  \"Masendeshita\" (ませんでした) is the polite form, based on the polite form of \"nai\" (masen - ません) and the past tense marker. The semi-polite form is a shortening of the polite form, commonly used in everyday conversation."
