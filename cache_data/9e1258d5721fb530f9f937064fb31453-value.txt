  "writeup": "ことになっている (koto ni natte iru) is a grammatical structure indicating that something is expected or scheduled to happen, often due to a pre-arranged plan or rule.  It's a nuanced expression conveying a sense of obligation or expectation stemming from an external source, not merely the speaker's opinion.  Understanding its subtle differences from similar expressions is key to mastering its usage.  Think of it as 'it's decided that...', 'it's the rule that...', or 'it's expected that...'  The structure combines こと (koto, 'thing'), a nominalizer, with the verb なる (naru, 'to become') in its ている (teiru) form, implying a continuing state or ongoing arrangement. The 'ている' form indicates that the state of 'being decided' is ongoing, not just a one-time event. ",
  "etymology": "The structure is formed from こと (koto, a nominalizer indicating a state or fact), に (ni, a particle marking the target of a verb), なる (naru, to become), and ている (teiru, the continuous form of a verb, which can here be interpreted as an ongoing state).  It represents the established 'state' of 'becoming' something, indicating pre-arrangement.",

    {
      "japanese": "会議は午後２時から始まる**ことになっている**。",
      "english": "The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2 PM.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses standard, neutral language appropriate for a variety of settings and listeners, conveying factual information about the meeting schedule.  The phrase 「午後２時から始まる」 is the specific piece showing what is 'scheduled'. "
    },
    {
      "japanese": "今週末は、彼と旅行に行く**ことになっている**んです。",
      "english": "I'm supposed to go on a trip with him this weekend.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The addition of 「んです」 softens the tone, making it more polite and casual. The speaker, a female, uses the softer word 「彼」 for her boyfriend, indicating a casual intimate relationship. The sentence describes a planned action, showing the ongoing state of the arrangement."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "来週のプレゼンは、私が担当することになっている。",
      "english": "I'm scheduled to give the presentation next week.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a formal statement of a work-related schedule. The use of 「私」 is appropriate and direct for a professional setting. The phrase 「プレゼンは私が担当する」 shows a scheduled activity."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの人、実は私の彼氏**になることになっている**のよ。",
      "english": "That guy, actually, he's supposed to be my boyfriend.",
      "register": "shitashii kuchō",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「実は」 adds a playful, secretive element, suggesting a degree of intimacy and flirtation. The ending 「のよ」 is an intimate way of speaking. The sentence implies an expectation but also a hint of playful implication. The 「彼氏になる」 part is the key point showing the expected state."

    {
      "japanese": "このレストランでは、チップを払う**ことになっている**そうです。",
      "english": "I hear that in this restaurant, you're expected to pay a tip.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The addition of 「そうです」 shows that the speaker is relaying information they heard rather than stating a fact they personally know. This adds a level of politeness and indirectness. The 「チップを払う」 section is the part that shows that thing which is 'expected'."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "試験では、携帯電話を使わない**ことになっている**から、気を付けてね。",
      "english": "You're not supposed to use cell phones during the exam, so be careful.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a casual and friendly instruction, using the particle 「から」 to explain the reason behind the rule. The 「携帯電話を使わない」 describes what's 'not allowed' or not 'expected' to occur during the exam. The casualness comes through in 「ね」."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "The use of ことになっている can sometimes sound a bit formal, particularly when expressing a negative expectation or prohibition.  In casual conversation, more concise alternatives might be preferred, though this form remains perfectly natural in many contexts.",

      "term": "はずだ",
      "meaning": "Bound to (be), Expected to (be), Should be (able)",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike ことになっている, which emphasizes an established rule or expectation from an external source, はずだ suggests a logical deduction or strong probability based on the speaker's knowledge or assumption."

    {
      "term": "ことになる",
      "meaning": "It will end up being, It is the result of, It has been decided that",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "ことになる focuses on the eventual outcome or result, whereas ことになっている highlights the current state of being 'expected' or 'scheduled'—the pre-arranged plan itself rather than its eventual result."
    }

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion between these similar expressions, consider the source of the expectation. ことになっている implies a pre-existing arrangement or rule, はずだ suggests a logical prediction, and ことになる describes the eventual outcome of a process."
