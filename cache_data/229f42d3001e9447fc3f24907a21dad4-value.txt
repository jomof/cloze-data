  "writeup": "The expression と来たら (tokitarā) is a nuanced grammatical construction used to express a strong, often immediate association between two ideas.  It literally translates to 'when it comes to...' or 'concerning...', but its usage goes beyond a simple conditional.  It implies a certain inevitability or obviousness, a feeling of 'of course!' or 'naturally!'  The first part sets the stage, and the second part presents the speaker's almost reflexive response or expectation. This construction is frequently used to express surprise, agreement, or a shared understanding.  While grammatically simple, mastering its subtle implications requires a keen understanding of context and Japanese conversational flow. It's common in casual speech and can carry a slightly emphatic tone.",
  "etymology": "This phrase combines the particle と (to), indicating a topic or conjunction, the verb 来る (kuru, 'to come'), and the conditional particle たら (tara, 'if'). The combination creates a unique expression emphasizing a natural or expected consequence following a certain condition.",
