        "Register": "Varies with sentence context.",
        "Function": "Specifies a time limit or boundary. Can also indicate duration when paired with 'から'.",
        "Nuance": "Indicates 'at' or 'by' a specific time.  It marks the limit of a period or the point at which something ends or becomes due.",
        "Counterpoint": "Contrast with 'に' which specifies a point in time, while 'で' often indicates the end or duration.",
        "Origin": "Grammaticalization of the particle 'で' from its broader usage to indicate location or means. It's extended to temporal contexts to indicate a temporal scope.",
        "Collocation": "Often used with time expressions, e.g., '今日で' (by today), '今週で' (by this week)."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle で originally indicated location or means, but it extended to indicate the limit or boundary in time. Think of it as marking the 'location' where something stops in the timeline.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「で」 in its temporal sense indicates a limit or boundary in time. It can mean \"by\" a certain time or \"at\" a particular time, indicating the end of a period or a deadline. 「で」 often specifies when something will be completed or how long something has been ongoing.  When used with 「から」, it indicates a duration, like \"from [start time] to [end time].\"  It's crucial to differentiate this usage from other functions of 「で」, such as indicating location or means of doing something.",
