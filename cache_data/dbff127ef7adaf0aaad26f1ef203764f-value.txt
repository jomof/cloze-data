  "writeup": "The conjunction particle たら is used as a kind of 'halfway point' between 'if' and 'when' in Japanese. It expresses the completion of an (A) action, and then a (B) action that is considered to be the result of (A). It may be hypothetical, or it may be presenting a one-time result of something that happened in the past. To use たら, it will replace た in the simple past form of verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns.  Caution: Despite appearing to be the past form of the word that it is attached to, たら itself does not actually carry the nuance of 'past'. Other words in the sentence will need to be examined to see whether たら is truly highlighting something from the past, or simply the completion of something (which may or may not happen in the future). Fun Fact: Although たら is regularly used to mean 'if', it almost always has a nuance of 'when'. This is due to たら specifically highlighting these situations:\n\n* **Completion**: 完了 - Completion of (A).\n* **Materialization**: 成立 - Coming to fruition of (A).\n\nThese meanings are opposed to other 'if' structures like ば and なら, which focus far more strongly on the hypothetical 'if' meaning.",
  "pronunciation": {
    "katakana": "タラ",
    "romaji": "tara"
  },
  "etymology": "The particle たら is derived from the combination of the past tense marker た and the conditional particle ら.  The ら suffix, while having a conditional nuance, also signifies a completed action, thus giving たら its unique blend of conditional and temporal meaning.",

      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the polite form 「いきましょう」 which shows respect. The use of たら emphasizes the action of bringing an umbrella as a natural consequence of the rain.",

      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": null,

      "nuance": "The 「ましょう」 form suggests a collaborative and polite invitation, common in a flirty context between a male and female.  The use of たら softens the directness of a simple 'if' statement, making the invitation more gentle and less demanding.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while たら suggests a completed action preceding the consequence, the time frame isn't always in the past. The focus is on the completion or materialization of the condition, which triggers the result.  The context of the sentence will determine whether the 'when' or 'if' meaning is more prominent.",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to differentiating these particles lies in understanding their subtle nuances.  Consider the relationship between the two actions. Is it a strict sequential order (てから), a hypothetical possibility (ば, なら), a natural consequence (たら), a suggestion (たらどう), or simply a temporal relationship (あとで, と, もし)? Carefully consider the context to choose the most appropriate particle."
