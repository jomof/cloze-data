  "writeup": "The grammar point \"あっての\" emphasizes that something (B) exists solely because of something else (A).  It's often translated as \"(B) owes everything to (A)\" or \"(B)'s existence is entirely due to (A).\"  This structure combines the te-form of the verb ある (aru, 'to be'), あって, and the possessive particle の.  It's used when (B) benefits positively from (A) and implies gratitude.  The particle が is sometimes used between (A) and あっての, but it's frequently omitted.  Interestingly, あっての can be viewed as an evolved form of がある ('to have'), with の indicating possession and the te-form suggesting further explanation of its importance. Because this additional context is crucial, (B) is often followed by particles like から (kara, 'because') or ので (node, 'because').",
  "etymology": "The etymology of あっての is straightforward. It's a combination of the て-form of the verb ある (to be) and the possessive particle の.  The て-form indicates a reason or condition, while の marks possession or attribution. Thus, the entire phrase conveys the conditional existence of one thing dependent upon another.",
