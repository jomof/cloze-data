    "etymology": "The word 「なんて」is derived from 「何て(なんて)」, which is the colloquial form of 「何と(なんと)」. 「何(なに)」means \"what,\" and the 「と」particle indicates a quote or content. Over time, 「何と」evolved to express not only direct questions but also exclamations of surprise or admiration.",
    "writeup": "「なんて」 is a versatile phrase used in colloquial Japanese to express surprise, admiration, or to inquire about something. It can function in a few different ways:\n\n*   **Asking what someone said:** When used with a verb of communication like 「言う」 (to say) or 「書く」 (to write), it asks what someone said or wrote. For example, 「なんて言ったの？」 (what did you say?).\n*   **Asking for a name or type:** When followed by 「いう」 and a noun, it asks for the name or type of something. 「なんていう建物ですか？」 (what kind of building is it?).\n*   **Expressing surprise or admiration:** When followed by an adjective or noun and 「んだろう」, it expresses a strong feeling of surprise or admiration. 「なんてきれいなんだろう！」 (how beautiful!).",
