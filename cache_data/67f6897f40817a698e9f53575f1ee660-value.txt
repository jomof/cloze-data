    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed from the て-form of the copula だ (で), combined with the particle しか which indicates a limitation, and the negative い-adjective ない.  Essentially, it expresses the idea that something is limited to being just that, and nothing more.",
    "writeup": "「でしかない」 is used to express that something is **merely** or **nothing more than** what is stated. Think of it as emphasizing the limited nature or significance of something.  It follows directly after a noun.\n\nWhile it can be used in neutral contexts, 「でしかない」 often carries a nuance of **diminishment** or **lack of value** beyond the stated noun.  It suggests that the subject doesn't have any further significance or worth.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「でしかない」 always follows a noun directly.\n*   It's similar to other 「しか」 constructions, but the 「で」 specifies that it attaches to a noun.\n*   The nuance can range from a simple statement of fact to a slightly negative evaluation.",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "serious",
            "nuance": "The use of the plain form 「だ」 and the directness of the statement create a casual yet firm tone, suitable for a serious discussion where the speaker dismisses the statement as merely an excuse."

        {
            "japanese": "先輩は「愛のムチだ」と言っているが、暴言**でしかない**。",
            "english": "My senior says it's tough love, but it's nothing more than abusive language.",
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "critical",
            "nuance": "The casual 「言っている」 contrasts with the stronger judgment 「暴言でしかない」, highlighting the speaker's negative perception of the senior's actions."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "息子にとっては宝物かもしれないが、私にとってはゴミ**でしかない**。",
            "english": "It might be a treasure to my son, but to me, it's just garbage.",
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "informative",
            "speaker_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "The contrast between 「宝物かもしれない」 and 「ゴミでしかない」 shows the speaker's personal opinion using casual language. The 「～かもしれない」 adds a touch of consideration before firmly stating their view."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "事故にあって、あなたが無事なら、心配いらない。車は車**でしかない**よ。",
            "english": "You were in an accident, but if you're safe, there's nothing to worry about. A car is just a car.",
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "supportive",
            "nuance": "The use of 「よ」 at the end adds a gentle and reassuring tone, typical in casual conversations offering comfort. The speaker is minimizing the importance of the car compared to the person's well-being."

        {
            "japanese": "どんなに成長しても、親から見ると息子は子供**でしかない**。",
            "english": "No matter how much he grows up, to his parents, a son is always just a child.",
            "register": "standard",
            "setting": "reflective",
            "nuance": "This sentence uses a more general and reflective tone, appropriate for stating a common sentiment.  「どんなに～ても」 sets up the contrast effectively."

            "japanese": "彼女から秘密を教えてもらったが、ウソ**でしかなかった**。",

            "register": "semi-formal",
            "setting": "academic",
            "nuance": "The expression 「机上の空論」 itself is somewhat formal, fitting an academic or intellectual setting. 「～が」 is used to concede a point before presenting a contrasting view."

        {
            "japanese": "君の言うことはもっともだが、飽くまで理想**でしかない**。",

            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "persuasive",
            "nuance": "The use of 「君」 (less casual than 「お前」 but still informal), 「もっとも」 (valid, reasonable), and 「飽くまで」 (to the end, ultimately) creates a thoughtful and slightly formal tone, suitable for a discussion where the speaker is acknowledging a point but emphasizing its impracticality. This could be used to gently persuade someone."

            "listener_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "The 「ねえ」 and the use of small voice 「小声で」 indicate intimacy. 「わけないよ」 is a rhetorical question suggesting the opposite, implying the smile is more meaningful to him. This creates a flirty innuendo.",
            "etymology": "「わけない」 literally means 'there's no reason why not' but in this context, used with a negative implication, it suggests strong doubt or disbelief."

    "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while 「でしかない」 can be used neutrally, it often carries a subtle nuance of downplaying or limiting the significance of the noun it follows. Pay attention to the context to understand the intended implication.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「でしかない」 which emphasizes the limitation of a noun, 「にすぎない」 often expresses a simple quantitative limit or a lack of importance without the same inherent negative connotation."

            "nuance": "While similar in expressing limitation, 「しか～ない」 is a more fundamental grammatical structure that focuses purely on 'only' or 'nothing but'. 「でしかない」 adds a layer of evaluation, suggesting something is *merely* that and nothing more significant."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「にすぎない」 and 「しか～ない」 share the core meaning of limitation with 「でしかない」, the latter often carries a stronger sense of dismissal or lack of additional value. Be mindful of this subtle difference when choosing between these expressions to accurately convey your intended meaning."
