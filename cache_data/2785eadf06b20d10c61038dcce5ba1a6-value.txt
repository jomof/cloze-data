  "writeup": "へ行く (he iku) is a common Japanese phrase meaning \"to go to\" or \"to head toward.\"  While often used interchangeably with に行く (ni iku),  a subtle but important distinction exists.  に emphasizes the *destination*, while へ emphasizes the *direction or journey* itself. Think of it this way: に is about *arriving*, へ is about *going*. This nuance extends beyond just location; it's inherent to the particles に and へ. This difference, though subtle, significantly enriches the expressiveness of the language. Mastering this distinction adds a layer of sophistication to your Japanese communication.",
  "etymology": "The particle へ (e) is believed to have evolved from an older form indicating direction.  The verb 行く (iku) meaning \"to go\" is quite ancient and fundamental to Japanese.  The combination thus reflects a straightforward expression of movement toward a location.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Notice the subtle shifts in register and politeness level dictated by context and the choice of conjugation.  The key is to observe how naturally the particle へ (e) directs the action toward the destination without necessarily emphasizing the destination itself.
