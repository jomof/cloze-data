    "writeup": "「こと」 is a noun that refers to an abstract thing, matter, event, or fact. It's often used to nominalize verbs and adjectives, turning them into nouns. For example, 「話すこと」 means \"the act of speaking\" or \"something to talk about.\" With nouns, 「こと」 means \"things about\" or \"matters concerning,\" as in 「先生のこと」 (things about the teacher). It can be translated as \"thing; what; matter; fact.\"",
    "etymology": "The origin of 「こと」 can be traced back to classical Japanese, where it broadly referred to 'affairs,' 'events,' or 'matters.' Over time, its usage evolved to include the nominalization function it has today.",
