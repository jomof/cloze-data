    "writeup": "によらず (ni yorazu) is a grammar point that means \"regardless of,\" \"irrespective of,\" or \"no matter.\" It indicates that a particular condition or factor does not affect the outcome or situation being described. This expression is often used in formal contexts and emphasizes the lack of dependence on a specific variable. It can connect nouns, question words, or contrasting conditions, such as \"whether X or Y.\"",
    "etymology": "The grammar point によらず is derived from the verb 寄る (yoru), meaning \"to depend on\" or \"to rely on,\" in its negative form. The particle に (ni) indicates the object of dependence, and the verb 寄らず (yorazu) conveys the idea of not depending on something.",
