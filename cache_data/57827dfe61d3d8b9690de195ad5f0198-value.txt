    "etymology": "The verb 「なす」 has ancient roots in Japanese, related to the concept of bringing something into being or causing something to happen. Over time, its usage has evolved to encompass a range of meanings related to action, creation, and transformation. Its written form and usage give it a formal tone.",
    "writeup": "「なす」 is a formal verb meaning \"to do,\" \"to perform,\" \"to make,\" \"to change,\" or \"to constitute.\" It often appears in written language and formal speech. It's not as common in everyday conversation as 「する」 or 「行う」. The passive form, 「なされる」, is frequently used in honorific language (keigo).  It's important to note that 「なす」 implies a sense of purposefulness and formality. It can also mean to regard A as B, such as 「醜を美となす」 'to see beauty in ugliness.'  When used with words like 「基礎」 (foundation) or 「根幹」 (core), it signifies that something forms the basis of something else.",
