  "writeup": "めく and めいた are fascinating suffixes in Japanese.  They aren't standalone verbs; instead, they modify nouns, giving them the nuance of 'showing signs of' or 'having the appearance of' something.  The speaker's subjective perception is key here; the thing described might not *actually* be what it seems, but that's how the speaker perceives it.  This creates a subtle, almost poetic effect, hinting at a certain feeling or impression.  The plain past tense めいた is most frequent when attached to a noun, adding a layer of completed observation. めく's versatility lies in its conjugations;  you'll find the te-form めいて quite common in everyday speech, too.  However, exercise caution: めく primarily works with established expressions, so stick to phrases you've already encountered.  Some common examples are 謎めく (to appear mysterious), 皮肉めく (to seem sarcastic), and 秋めく (to feel autumnal).",
  "etymology": "The etymology of めく is not completely clear, but it's likely related to verbs expressing visual or sensory perception. The -めく suffix itself appears to have evolved over time from a root that conveys a sense of subtle change or resemblance.",
