  "writeup": "The phrase \"に越したことはない\" translates to \"There's nothing better than...\" or \"It would be best to...\"  It expresses an ideal or optimal situation.  It's formed by combining the particle に, the past-tense form of the verb 越す (kosu, to surpass), こと (koto, thing), は (wa, topic marker), and ない (nai, negative).  The past tense of 越す is crucial; it doesn't imply a completed action but rather sets the stage for the ideal state. This structure works with verbs, adjectives, and nouns in their plain forms. While generally positive, it can also be used with a negative nuance, effectively meaning 'it would be best *not* to...' when following a negative form. For instance,  \"失敗しないに越したことはない\" (shippai shinai ni koshita koto wa nai) means \"It's best not to fail.\" This nuanced usage is quite common.",
