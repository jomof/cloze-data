    "etymology": "The verb 「くれる」 originally meant \"to give,\" but over time, its meaning became specialized to indicate giving specifically to the speaker or someone close to them. It is related to the verb 「呉(く)る (kuru)」, which means \"to provide\" or \"to do (for someone),\" but the nuance has shifted to focus on the direction of giving towards the speaker.",
    "writeup": "「くれる」 is part of a trio of verbs used for giving and receiving in Japanese: 「くれる」, 「あげる」, and 「もらう」. 「くれる」 means \"to give\" to you or someone considered part of your \"in-group.\" With both 「くれる」 and 「あげる」, the particles function as expected: 「が」 marks the giver, 「に」 marks the recipient, and 「を」 marks the object given.\n\nThe giver and/or recipient are often omitted from sentences with 「くれる」 because they are usually obvious from the context, or the sentence's focus is on the object being given.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Your \"in-group\" varies from person to person but usually includes family, club members, or similar groups where you feel a sense of belonging.\n*   The giver is generally someone more distant than those in the \"in-group.\"\n*   To indicate giving to someone *not* in your \"in-group,\" use 「あげる」 instead.",
