        "Form": "Verb (dictionary form) + ことで. Noun + であることで (formal)",

        "Noun + であることで": "Formal way of saying 'because of being [noun]'. Commonly used in written language or formal speech."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことで」 combines 「こと」 (koto), which means 'thing' or 'event', with the particle 「で」 (de), which indicates means or cause. Therefore, literally it means 'by means of that thing/event' or 'because of that thing/event'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ことで」 is used to express a cause, reason, or method. It translates to \"by means of,\" \"because of,\" or \"by V-ing.\" It is formed by attaching 「ことで」 to the dictionary form of a verb or, formally, 「であることで」 to a noun.\n\nFor nouns, remember that the formal 「である」 is necessary, especially in written contexts. In everyday speech, using 「ことで」 directly after a noun without 「である」 might sound unnatural or incomplete.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「ことで」 emphasizes the action or state as the direct reason or method.\n*   It's versatile and can be used in various situations, but pay attention to the formality, especially when using it with nouns.",
