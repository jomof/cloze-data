    "writeup": "The phrase 「それだけ」 indicates that the degree of something is proportionate to something else mentioned previously. It conveys the idea of \"that much\", \"to that extent\", or \"equally\". This grammar point is versatile and can be used in a variety of situations to show a direct relationship between two factors. The relationship can be positive or negative; for example, if the effort increases, the reward increases 「努力が増えれば、それだけ報酬も増える」, or if expectations rise, disappointment rises correspondingly 「期待が大きければ、それだけ失望も大きくなる」. It is often used to emphasize the extent or degree of something in relation to another factor.",
    "etymology": "「それ」 refers to \"that,\" and 「だけ」 means \"only\" or \"just.\" Therefore, 「それだけ」 literally translates to \"only that\" or \"just that,\" implying that the degree or extent is limited or defined by the preceding context.",
