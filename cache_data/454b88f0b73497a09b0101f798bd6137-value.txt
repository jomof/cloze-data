  "etymology": "The etymology of 「誰 (dare)」 is not clearly established. However, one theory suggests its origin lies in the word 「誰彼 (tare-kare)」. 「誰彼」 originally meant \"this and that\" or \"anyone and everyone,\" referring to unspecified individuals. It is believed that the 「誰 (tare)」 component of 「誰彼」 eventually became an independent interrogative pronoun, evolving into 「誰 (dare)」.",
  "writeup": "「誰 (だれ)」 is a pronoun used to ask “who” when the person is unknown. Depending on the particle that follows 「誰」, its meaning can slightly change. For example:\n\n*   「誰が (だれが)」: who (as a subject)\n*   「誰の (だれの)」: whose\n*   「誰か (だれか)」: somebody\n*   「誰でも (だれでも)」: anybody / everyone\n*   「誰にも (だれにも)」: (not) to anyone / (not) to everyone\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   In polite speech, 「どなた」 or 「どちら様」 are used instead of 「誰」. Use 「どなた」 in honorific language (*sonkeigo*) and 「どちら様」 in polite speech (*teineigo*).",
