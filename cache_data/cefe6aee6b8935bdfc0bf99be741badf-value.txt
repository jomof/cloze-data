  "writeup": "The particle 以外 (いがい) means \"except,\" \"besides,\" \"other than,\" or \"with the exception of.\"  It's a versatile particle used to exclude something from a larger set.  Understanding its nuances is key to using it effectively. The kanji 以 (i) means 'by means of' and 外 (gai) means 'outside'.  Therefore, 以外 literally means 'outside of the means of'. This highlights the exclusionary nature of the particle.  While sometimes used to express surprise—similar to 意外 (いがい, unexpected)—the latter is more grammatically correct for that specific meaning.  Even native speakers sometimes use them interchangeably, demonstrating the subtle overlap in meaning and usage.",
  "etymology": "以外 (いがい) is a compound word formed from the kanji 以 (i), meaning \"by means of\" or \"by,\" and 外 (gai), meaning \"outside\" or \"exterior.\"  The combination perfectly captures the sense of exclusion—what's outside the scope or means of something else.",
