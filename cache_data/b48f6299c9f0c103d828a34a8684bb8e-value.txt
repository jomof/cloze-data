  "writeup": "そんなに, similar to そんな, is a common adverbial phrase used to express a degree or extent.  It's often translated as 'so much,' 'that much,' or 'like that.' The particle に emphasizes the extent or degree being described.  It modifies verbs, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives.  Think of it as 'to a degree like (X),' where (X) is the following clause.  Related phrases include こんなに, あんなに, and どんなに, but そんなに is the most frequently used (excluding どんなに, which is often used for explanations or reasons).",
  "etymology": "そんなに is a combination of the word そんな (such, like that) and the particle に (to, towards, in the direction of). The particle に here indicates the direction or extent of the described quantity or quality.",
