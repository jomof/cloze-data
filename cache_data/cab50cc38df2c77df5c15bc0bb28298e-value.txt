    "etymology": "The verb 「知る」(shiru) is one of the oldest words in the Japanese language, with its origins traceable back to ancient Japanese texts. It represents the fundamental concept of acquiring knowledge or becoming aware of something. Over time, its meaning has remained consistent, and it's a core verb in everyday communication.",
    "writeup": "「知る」(shiru) means \"to know\", \"to get to know\", \"to be acquainted with\", or \"to understand\". It's a fundamental verb for expressing knowledge or awareness of something.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   When 「知る」 is in the 「〜ている」 form (e.g., 「知っている」), it expresses the *state* of knowing something, rather than the action of coming to know it. For example, 「知っています」 means \"I know\".\n*   「知る」 is often contrasted with 「分かる」(wakaru), which means \"to understand\" in the sense of grasping the meaning or reason behind something. Use 「知る」 when referring to acquaintance with a fact, person, or thing. 「分かる」 is used for understanding the *reason* behind something.",
