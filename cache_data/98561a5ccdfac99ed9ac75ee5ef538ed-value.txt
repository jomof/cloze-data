        "[Someone] が + [Speaker/Speaker's In-group] に + [Object] を + 呉れる/くれる": "Someone gives something to the speaker or someone close to the speaker."
    },
    "meaning": "To give (used when someone gives something to the speaker or someone closely associated with the speaker)",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Varies depending on the verb form used (plain, polite, etc.).",
        "Usage": "Used when someone *gives* something to the speaker or someone in the speaker's inner circle. The giver is not of higher status than the speaker.",
        "Nuance": "Indicates that the giver is providing a benefit or favor to the speaker or someone close to the speaker."
    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「くれる」 originally meant \"to give,\" but its usage is specifically limited to situations where the recipient is the speaker or someone close to them. The kanji 「呉」 implies an act of bestowing or conferring something. It is part of the 'giving and receiving' verb group, contrasting with 「あげる」 (to give to someone of equal or higher status) and 「もらう」 (to receive).",
    "writeup": "「呉れる・くれる」 (kureru) means \"to give.\" However, unlike the English word \"give,\" it's used only when the recipient is the speaker or someone closely associated with them, such as a family member or close friend.  It implies that the giver is bestowing a favor or benefit on the recipient.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   This verb emphasizes the **benefit** received by the speaker or their in-group.\n*   The giver should not be of higher status than the speaker. If they are, 「くださる」 is more appropriate.\n*   「くれる」 is part of a set of verbs that describe giving and receiving actions in Japanese, and understanding its specific usage is crucial to avoid sounding unnatural.",
