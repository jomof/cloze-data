  "writeup": "たとたんに (tato tan ni), often written in kanji as た途端に (ta totan ni), indicates that something happens the instant or moment something else occurs.  It's a fascinating grammatical structure combining the auxiliary verb た (ta), showing the completion of an action, with the noun 途端 (totan), meaning 'the very moment' or 'immediately'.  Think of it as marking a sudden, immediate consequence.  The particle に (ni) functions adverbially, modifying the entire phrase. The nuance often suggests that event (B) is somewhat unexpected or uncontrollable, happening directly after or even simultaneously with event (A).  This structure is versatile and can be used in a range of contexts, from casual conversations to more formal settings.",
  "etymology": "The word 途端 (totan) literally translates to \"on the verge of\" or \"on the brink of.\"  It is a compound word; 途 (to) meaning 'way' or 'route', and 端 (tan) meaning 'end' or 'edge.'  Thus, the structure implies an abrupt transition from one state to another at the very moment the preceding action is completed.",
