    "etymology": "から originates from the verb 「離(か)れる」, meaning \"to separate\" or \"to be apart from.\" Over time, it evolved into a particle indicating the starting point or origin.",
    "writeup": "から has several meanings in Japanese depending on its context. In its most basic sense, it translates to \"from,\" indicating a starting point in space or time. When used after a location, it signifies the origin of an action or movement. For example, 「駅からバスで来た」 means \"I came from the station by bus.\"\n\nThis particle follows directly after the noun indicating the starting point. It's important to note that から does **not** require だ after nouns or な-adjectives in this context, as adding だ would change the meaning to \"because.\"",
