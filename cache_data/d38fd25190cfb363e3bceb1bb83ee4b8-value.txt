    "writeup": "「て仕方がない」 expresses a feeling or sensation that the speaker finds overwhelming and cannot control. It's similar to saying \"can't help but feel...\" or \"can't stand it anymore.\" It is important to recognize that the grammar point describes feelings that you can't control. The verb is in the て-form, い-adjectives drop the い and are followed by くて, and な-adjectives are followed by で. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The grammar point is typically used to describe strong emotions such as sadness, happiness, or anger, or strong sensations such as itching or thirst.\n*   It is often used to express a sense of helplessness or frustration.\n*   Related expressions include 「てならない」 and 「てたまらない」.",
    "etymology": "「仕方」 means 'method' or 'way of doing,' and 「ない」 means 'there is not.' So, literally, 「て仕方がない」 means 'there is no way to stop' the feeling.",
