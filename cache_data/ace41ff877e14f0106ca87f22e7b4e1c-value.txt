        "Usage": "Follows an informal sentence or clause. Often used when the speaker is unsure or speculating."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「やら」 is thought to have originated from a combination of 「や」, an interrogative particle, and 「あら」, an exclamation expressing surprise or doubt. Over time, it evolved to express a general sense of uncertainty or wondering.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「やら」 is used at the end of a sentence to express a sense of uncertainty, doubt, or wondering. It's similar to saying \"I wonder...\" in English. It is more commonly used in informal speech and writing. The speaker is often reflecting on something without expecting a direct answer. It can also imply a rhetorical question.\n\n*   **Formation:** The particle 「やら」 typically follows a verb in its informal (plain) form, an adjective, or a noun. When attaching to a な-adjective or noun, 「だ」 is often omitted, but 「だった」 can be used for the past tense.\n\n*   **Nuance:** 「やら」 can convey a sense of resignation or helplessness, especially when used in situations where the speaker feels uncertain about the future or unable to control the outcome.",
