  "writeup": "The volitional form of a verb, typically ending in -よう (yō), expresses intention or willingness.  Adding とした (toshita) – the past tense of とする (tosuru, meaning 'to try to' or 'to be about to') – creates a nuanced expression.  This construction describes an attempt or intention that was interrupted or unsuccessful.  The particle が (ga) marks a contrast, indicating the unforeseen event that prevented the completion of the intended action.  Think of it as \"I was going to… but then…\". The nuance emphasizes the unexpected nature of the interruption.  This structure is versatile and used across various registers.",
  "etymology": "The structure's core lies in the verb する (suru, 'to do'), which, in its volitional form ようとする (yō tosuru), indicates an intended action.  Adding the past tense とした (toshita) transforms the intended action into an attempted action, while が (ga) highlights the unexpected interruption.",
