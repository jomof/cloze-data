    "writeup": "The verb suffix 込む (-komu), written with the kanji 込 (to be crowded, to include), attaches to the **conjunctive form (連用形)** of other verbs. It conveys the nuances of doing something thoroughly, deeply, or remaining in a certain state.  Think of it as "jamming" an action into a state.  The main senses are:\n\n*   **Remaining in a state:**  This implies staying in a certain condition or location.\n*   **Doing something thoroughly or intensely:** This suggests a deep or complete involvement in an action.",
