  "writeup": "反面 (hanmen), a noun meaning 'the opposing side,' is a construction in Japanese that appears between two phrases to show two contrasting or opposite features of a single person or thing.  This usually translates as 'while (A), (B),' 'although (A), also (B),' or 'on the other hand to (A), (B).'  Being a noun, 反面 can follow any word that could create a modified noun, such as verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or even other nouns followed by である (de aru). \n\n**Important Considerations:** Because 反面 is used to express contradictions, it will most often describe a positive and a negative but cannot describe a positive and another positive, or a negative and another negative.  The nuance lies in presenting a balanced perspective, highlighting both advantages and disadvantages.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of 反面 (hanmen) is straightforward.  反 (han) means \"opposite\" or \"reverse,\" and 面 (men) means \"side\" or \"surface.\" Thus, the word literally translates to \"opposite side,\" perfectly encapsulating its function in expressing contrasting aspects.",
