    "writeup": "As explained in the general grammar point for **ところ**, this noun often highlights the situation within which a verb is **about to** happen (when that verb appears in its dictionary form). However, when followed by **だった**, it emphasizes that the action that was \"about to\" happen did not actually occur, or another more significant event took place at that moment. This can be translated as \"to almost (do something)\" or \"to be on the verge of (doing something)\".\n\nThe verb that precedes **ところ** can also be paired with the negative auxiliary verb **ない**. In this case, it implies that something was \"about not\" to happen but then did.",
