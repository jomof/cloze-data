    "etymology": "「どれ」 is part of the 「こそあど」 family of words (kosoado kotoba), specifically the 「ど」 (do) series. These words, including 「どこ」 (where) and 「だれ」 (who), are interrogative pronouns used to inquire about something unknown. 「どれ」's origin reflects its function: to ask which item from a set of options is being referred to.",
    "writeup": "「どれ」 is from the same family of words as 「これ」, 「それ」, and 「あれ」. These words are called 「こそあど言葉」 (kosoado kotoba) in Japanese. Unlike the other three, which all point to a specific thing, words starting with 「ど」 are designed for enquiring about something unknown.\n\n「どれ」 can roughly be translated as \"which\" in English and is used for enquiring about a group (of 3 or more things). From the examples, we can see that the particle 「が」 is often used with 「どれ」, especially preceding questions. However, when 「どれ」 follows a noun, 「は」 will be used.\n\nWhen there are only two choices to select between, 「どちら+の」, or 「どっち+の」 will be used instead of 「どれ」. This is a habit that has become part of the language over time and was not originally how these words were used.",
