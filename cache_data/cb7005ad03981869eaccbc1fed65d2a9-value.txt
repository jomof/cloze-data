  "writeup": "にもまして is a fascinating grammatical structure used to express a degree exceeding a prior state or expectation.  It conveys the idea that something has surpassed a certain level, often implying a previous consistent state.  Common translations include 'even more than (A), (B)' or 'more than ever (B).'  It's a combination of the particle に, marking the point of comparison, the adverbial particle も 'even,' and the て-form of the verb 増す masu, 'to increase.'  Therefore, a literal translation might be 'even increasing from (A), (B).'  The structure often follows words like 誰 dare 'who,' 何 nani 'what,' or いつ itsu 'when,' resulting in translations like 'more than anyone,' 'more than anything,' or 'more than ever.'  Understanding its nuanced meaning is key to using it effectively. This is an advanced grammatical point, fitting for advanced learners.  Mastering it will significantly enrich your Japanese expressiveness.",
  "etymology": "The structure's etymology is straightforward. It combines the particle に (ni), indicating the subject of the comparison, the particle も (mo), emphasizing 'even,' and the て-form (mashite) of the verb 増す (masu), meaning 'to increase.'  The て-form indicates a continuous or progressive increase from the point of comparison established by the に particle.",
