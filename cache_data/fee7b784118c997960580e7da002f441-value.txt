    "writeup": "飽く is an older form of the verb 飽きる (akiru), which means \"to tire of\" or \"to get sick of.\" When combined with the adverbial particle まで (made), meaning \"until,\" 飽くまで (akumade) implies continuing something to the point of being fully satisfied or, in this context, reaching the limit of what something is.  Therefore, it conveys the idea of \"just,\" \"only,\" or \"strictly.\"  It suggests that something is nothing more than what is being stated. The particle も (mo), meaning \"even,\" can be added for emphasis, making it 飽くまでも (akumademo). This usage of 飽くまで is typically adverbial and often appears at the beginning of a phrase.\n\nFrequently, 飽くまで(も) is used in polite situations when expressing a personal opinion.  In such cases, it softens the statement by implying \"this is merely my opinion,\" acknowledging that other viewpoints exist. This function of highlighting opinions is often seen with conjunctions like けど (kedo) or が (ga), further softening the statement before offering a suggestion or thought.",
