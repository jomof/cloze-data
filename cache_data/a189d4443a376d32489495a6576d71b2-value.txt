  "writeup": "およそ or おおよそ, alternatively written as 凡そ or 大凡, is an adverb that commonly translates to \"approximately\" or \"roughly\" in English. It's primarily used in slightly more formal contexts and is frequently heard in announcements.  The nuance lies in its implication of an estimation rather than a precise figure.  Think of it as conveying a general sense of quantity or time, not a precise measurement.  Its placement at the beginning of a sentence is typical, particularly when discussing time or distance.  The kanji 凡 itself means \"commonplace\" or \"as a rule,\" suggesting that the stated approximation generally holds true, but not in every instance.",
  "etymology": "The word おおよそ is composed of およ (oyo, meaning roughly or approximately) and そ (so, a particle indicating emphasis or approximation).  The kanji 凡 (bon) in 凡そ conveys the sense of commonality or generality.",

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while おおよそ implies approximation, the context determines the degree of precision implied.  In formal settings, it suggests a carefully considered estimate; in casual settings, it's more of a ballpark figure.  The choice of accompanying particles also significantly impacts the overall nuance.",
