  "writeup": "The Japanese grammar point \"Verb[ないで]\" is a casual way to request someone not to do something.  It's used in informal settings, like conversations between close friends or family.  Think of it as a softer, less formal alternative to \"ないでください\", which is a polite imperative.  This structure is formed by attaching \"ないで\" to the negative stem of a verb.  Unlike the more complex \"ないで\" constructions expressing actions *without* doing something else, this functions more like a simple, implied request:  \"Please don't...\"",
  "etymology": "ないで is a combination of the negative form ない (nai) and the particle で (de).  The particle で marks the means or manner of an action, lending a casual, almost implied, quality to the negative request.  Its origins lie in the versatile nature of で, capable of expressing various grammatical functions including the instrument, the means and also the casual manner.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while  \"ないで\" works well in informal settings,  using \"ないでください\" is essential when showing respect or politeness. The choice depends heavily on your relationship with the person you're talking to. Context is key!",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "ないでください",
      "nuance": "Unlike ないで, which is a casual request, ないでください is a polite request.  It adds the polite suffix ください, making it suitable for formal situations."
