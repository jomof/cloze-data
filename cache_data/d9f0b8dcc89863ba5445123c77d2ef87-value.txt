    "etymology": "なんて is a colloquial version of なんと (nanto), which itself is derived from 何 (nan, what) + と (to, a particle indicating a quote or content). It expresses surprise, admiration, or disbelief, similar to saying \"What!\" or \"How!\" in English.",
    "writeup": "**なんて** is a versatile phrase used in colloquial Japanese to express a range of emotions and questions. It can function similarly to \"what,\" \"how,\" or \"so\" in English, depending on the context. It can be used to ask for clarification, to express surprise or admiration, or to downplay the significance of something. The usage depends heavily on the context and the intonation of the speaker.\n\n*   When used with verbs like 言う (iu, to say) or 書く (kaku, to write), **なんて** seeks information about what was said or written.\n*   The structure **なんていう** followed by a noun is used to ask for the name or title of something.\n*   Attaching **んだろう** to a phrase with **なんて** intensifies the emotion, conveying a sense of wonder, admiration, or disbelief. This pattern frequently uses an adjective or a noun to express a heightened emotional state.",
