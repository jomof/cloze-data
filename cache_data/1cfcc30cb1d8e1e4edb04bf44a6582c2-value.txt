  "writeup": "The prefix \"ma,\" derived from the kanji 真 (shin, true), intensifies the following word, conveying a sense of completeness, exactitude, or genuineness.  Its pronunciation shifts subtly depending on the following word's initial sound.  This variation isn't fully captured in simple romaji transcription.  Generally, when followed by a word beginning with a 'ma' sound or a 'na' sound, it becomes \"man-\"; otherwise, it usually becomes \"mat-\".  However, there are exceptions, such as with 青い (aoi, blue) and 赤い (akai, red), where the following word changes too. Mastering these subtle shifts is key to sounding natural.  This is a versatile particle that adds significant depth and precision to your Japanese vocabulary.",
  "etymology": "The prefix \"ma\" originates from the kanji 真 (shin), meaning \"true\" or \"genuine.\"  Its use as an intensifier reflects a desire to emphasize the absolute nature of the described quality or action.  Over time, the pronunciation evolved into the \"ma\" we see today, becoming phonologically integrated with the following word.",
