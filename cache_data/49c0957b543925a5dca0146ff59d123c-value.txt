    "etymology": "The expression 「言うまでもない」 is composed of several parts:\n\n*   「言う(iu)」: The dictionary form of the verb \"to say.\"\n*   「まで(made)」: A particle meaning \"up to\" or \"until.\"\n*   「も(mo)」: A particle meaning \"also\" or \"even.\"\n*   「ない(nai)」: A negative adjective meaning \"not\" or \"without.\"\n\nTaken literally, it suggests that there's no need to even go as far as saying something because it's already obvious.",
    "writeup": "Unlike 「～は言うまでもない」, which usually comes after other phrases, 「言うまでもない」 tends to come at the beginning. It is a structure that combines the verb 「言う」 (iu, to say), two adverbial particles 「まで」 (made) and 「も」 (mo), and the adjective 「ない」 (nai). This is regularly translated as \"it goes without saying that (A)\", or \"it is needless to say (A)\", where (A) is whatever comes later in the sentence.\n\n「言うまでもない」 is often followed directly by 「ことだが」, 「が」, 「けど」, and similar expressions, to add the nuance of \"but\".\n\n**Important Note:** 「言うまでもない」 is a polite way to express that something is \"obvious\", without unintentionally sounding arrogant.",
