  "writeup": "In Japanese grammar, な-adjectives are a fascinating group.  Unlike い-adjectives, which modify nouns directly, な-adjectives require the particles だ (plain) or です (polite) to form complete predicates.  Think of them as adjectives that behave like nouns.  The dictionary form, as you'll see, always needs this particle to complete a sentence.  They are primarily words of foreign origin, often from Chinese or English, and that explains their unique conjugation patterns.  A simple trick to identify them is to use the adverb とても (totemo, \"very\"). If it sounds natural before a word—e.g., とても綺麗 (totemo kirei, \"very pretty\")—it's likely a な-adjective.  If it sounds unnatural—e.g., とても犬 (totemo inu, \"very dog\")—it's probably a noun. This is because な-adjectives describe qualities that can be measured in degrees, unlike most nouns. ",
