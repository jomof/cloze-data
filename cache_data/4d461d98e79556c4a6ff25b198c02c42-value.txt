    "etymology": "The particle 「な」 is thought to have originated from the verb 「な-」 (to not do), which is now obsolete. It evolved to become a sentence-ending particle that conveys a strong sense of prohibition.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「な」 is a sentence-ending particle used to express a strong prohibition. It is attached directly to the dictionary form of a verb. It carries a forceful nuance, telling someone **not** to do something. Because of its directness, 「な」 is typically used in informal situations, often between close friends, family members, or when addressing someone of lower status. It can also be used in emergencies or when expressing strong emotions. Adding 「よ」 after 「な」 can soften the tone slightly.",
