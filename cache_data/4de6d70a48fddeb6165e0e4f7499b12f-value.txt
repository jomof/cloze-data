    "etymology": "The kanji 「再」 means \"again\" or \"re-\". The suffix 「び」 also means \"again\" and is often used with words to indicate repetition. Thus, 「再び」 literally means \"again-again\", emphasizing the repetition for a second time.",
    "writeup": "「再び」 is an adverb signifying repetition, specifically for the **second time**. It translates to \"again\", \"once more\", or \"a second time\".  It often appears at the beginning of a sentence, setting the stage for a repeated action or state.  It's **important** to note the nuance of  \"second time\";  it's less suitable for things that occur repeatedly beyond just the second instance.  \n\n**Important Consideration:** While 「また」 also translates to \"again\", 「再び」 carries a more formal tone and is more prevalent in written materials like books and articles than in everyday spoken Japanese.",
