  "etymology": "以上 is a compound word formed from the kanji 以 (i) meaning \"by means of\" or \"according to,\" and 上 (jou) meaning \"above.\"  Therefore, literally, it means something like \"above (a certain point).\" This reflects its function as a marker indicating a minimum quantity or level.",
  "writeup": "The particle 以上 (ijou) indicates a quantity or value that is equal to or greater than a specified amount.  It's attached to the number or measure word it modifies.  Think of it as \"and above.\"  For example,  \"100円以上\" means \"100 yen or more.\"  The nuance is that it sets a lower bound; the actual amount could be significantly higher.  It's versatile and commonly used in various contexts, from everyday conversations to formal settings.  Its use with counters is crucial—you always pair it with a counter that reflects what you are counting.  While it literally means \"above,\" the meaning is always 'minimum quantity' and it is never used to denote something purely spatially 'above'.  It is also frequently used to indicate the end of a list or a statement, similar to \"That's all.\" This usage is perfectly natural in Japanese and implies the completion of a conversation, report, or action. Importantly, this nuance is not limited to any particular gender, age group, or region.",
