    "writeup": "**いらっしゃる** is a common honorific expression in Japanese. It elevates the status of another person to show them respect. It is never used when referring to the speaker themselves or their own actions. **いらっしゃる** can replace 居る (to be), 来る (to come), or 行く (to go). This is due to the unique perspective that honorific language places the speaker in, relative to the person being respected. This is a slightly advanced concept that will be discussed more later. To use **いらっしゃる**, simply replace いる, くる, or いく. Alternatively, **いらっしゃる** may also be used to replace いる, くる, or いく when they are attached to the て-form of another verb. おいでになる is another expression that can replace いる, くる, or いく. おいでになる and **いらっしゃる** are almost completely interchangeable.",
