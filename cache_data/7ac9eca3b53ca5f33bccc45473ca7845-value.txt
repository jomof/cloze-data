  "formation": {
    "[Statement A] + と いう こと は [Statement B]": "Statement A implies Statement B. Often used to draw a conclusion or explanation from a preceding statement."
  },
  "etymology": "This phrase is a combination of three elements:  という (to iu) meaning 'that which is said,' こと (koto) meaning 'thing' or 'matter,' and は (wa) a topic marker.  The combination creates a structure that presents a fact and then infers a consequence or explanation.",
  "writeup": "The Japanese phrase とはいうことは (to iu koto wa) serves as a versatile connector between two related ideas.  It's frequently used to indicate that the preceding statement implies or leads to a further conclusion.  Think of it as a sophisticated way to say \"That means...\" or \"In other words...\".  While it often appears mid-sentence, it can also initiate a sentence, sometimes forming a question to confirm understanding.  The construction's flexibility makes it suitable for various registers, from casual conversations to more formal settings.  Understanding its nuanced usage enhances fluency in Japanese.",
