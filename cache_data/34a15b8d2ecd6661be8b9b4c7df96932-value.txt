    "writeup": "The adverb **ますます** expresses the idea of a trend continuing and intensifying. It can mean \"increasingly,\" \"more and more,\" or even \"to keep (doing something).\" You'll often find it at the beginning of a sentence to emphasize this continuous progression. While sometimes written as **益々**, the meaning remains identical. The kanji 益 simply means \"gain.\" Interestingly, even though it can be written as 益々, **ますます** originally comes from the repetition of the verb **増す (ます)**, a *u-verb* meaning \"to increase.\" Because of this origin, **ますます** is typically used with verbs indicating change or adjectives that can increase in intensity.\n\n**Important Consideration:** Although **ますます** can be translated as \"less and less,\" this usage still implies an *increase* in a negative trend. For example, saying something is \"ますます減っていく\" (becoming less and less) signifies an increasing rate of decrease.",

Consider whether you want to emphasize the ongoing progression (ますます), the addition of something new (更に), the speed of the change (どんどん), a proportional relationship (ば〜ほど), or a singular, unavoidable direction (一方だ)."
