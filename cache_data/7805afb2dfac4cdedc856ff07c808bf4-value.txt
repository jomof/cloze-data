    "etymology": "The verb 「行く (iku)」 has ancient roots, tracing back to the early stages of the Japanese language. Its core meaning has remained consistent: to move from one place to another. Over time, it has evolved to encompass various nuances of movement and direction.",
    "writeup": "「行く (iku)」 is a fundamental verb meaning \"to go.\" It describes movement away from the speaker or the speaker's current viewpoint. It is a Group 1 verb (also known as a 五段動詞 godan dōshi), meaning it conjugates according to the Group 1 verb conjugation patterns. It's the opposite of 「来る (kuru)」, which means \"to come.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   Direction: The particle 「へ (e)」 or 「に (ni)」 typically marks the destination.\n*   Purpose: The 「ます」 stem of a verb + 「に」+ 「行く」 indicates going somewhere to do something (e.g., 「食べに行く tabe ni iku」 - to go to eat).\n*   Viewpoint: Whether something is 「行く」 or 「来る」 depends on where the speaker is and where they are mentally placing their viewpoint. For example, if X-san is away from home, but the speaker places his viewpoint near X-san's home, then 「X-san は 来週アメリカへ行く (X-san wa raishū Amerika e iku)」 would be correct, meaning \"X-san is going to America next week.\" However, 「X-san は 来週アメリカへ来る (X-san wa raishū Amerika e kuru)」 would *not* be correct.",
