  "writeup": "The particle 限り (kagiri) is a versatile grammatical element used to express limitations or conditions.  It's derived from the verb 限る (kagiru), meaning \"to limit.\" However, unlike other phrases using 限る, 限り doesn't include に, making its meaning heavily dependent on the preceding word.  It follows verbs in their dictionary form and nouns modified by である.  Let's examine its primary meanings and translations.  The most common meaning indicates that (B) is limited to the scope of (A).  This translates to 'limited to (A), (B)'.  Another meaning shows that within the limits of some source of information (A), (B) is true. This often concerns knowledge or sensory perception; translate it as 'as far as (A), (B)' or 'as long as (A), (B)'.  Finally, 限り can suggest that 'given (A), (B) is a necessary consideration.'  This implies that, assuming (A) is true, (B) also holds; translate as 'while (A) is the case, (B)' or 'assuming (A), (B)'.  Despite these nuances, 限り always frames (A) as the constraint within which (B) operates.  It's primarily used in formal settings.",
