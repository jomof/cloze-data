    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 marks the indirect object of a verb, indicating **to whom or for whom** an action is performed. This is commonly used with verbs of giving (like 「あげる」, 「くれる」, 「やる」), telling (like 「話す」, 「教える」), showing (like 「見せる」), and other verbs where something is transferred or directed towards someone or something. While it can be similar to 「へ」, 「に」 focuses on the **recipient** while 「へ」 focuses on the **direction**.",
