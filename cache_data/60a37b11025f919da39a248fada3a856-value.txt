    "writeup": "**どこ** is a pronoun used to ask about a location. It directly translates to \"where\". It's part of the *kosoado* (こそあど) series for places, contrasting with **ここ** (here), **そこ** (there), and **あそこ** (over there).

**Important Consideration:** Be careful not to confuse **どこ** with **どっち**. While both can be translated as \"where\" in some contexts, they have different nuances. **どこ** asks for a specific place, while **どっち** asks about a direction or a choice between two options.",
