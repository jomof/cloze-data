  "etymology": "The word たとえ originates from the verb 例える (taeru), meaning \"to speak figuratively\" or \"to use an analogy.\"  The ても form adds the nuance of 'even if' or 'despite'. The combination thus expresses a concessive condition.",
  "writeup": "The grammar point たとえ〜ても (tatoe ~te mo) means \"even if.\" It's used to introduce a hypothetical situation that, despite being true, doesn't negate the main clause.  It contrasts with もし (moshi), which implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship. たとえ emphasizes a concession, suggesting that the outcome remains unchanged regardless of the hypothetical circumstance.  The usage is standard across most registers.  While not exclusively limited to any particular group, this construction is versatile enough for use among various ages and genders.  The structure typically places たとえ at the beginning of the clause expressing the hypothetical situation.",

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "nuance": "The use of 「どんなに素敵な人だっても」emphasizes the speaker's strong resolve, even in the face of what others might see as a tempting prospect. This is a natural way for a woman to express her decisiveness."

    {
      "japanese": "たとえ明日世界が終わる**としても**、私はあなたといたい。",

      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "nuance": "The statement 「たとえ明日世界が終わるとしても」dramatically emphasizes the speaker's feelings.  The 「といたい」expression adds to the intimate and somewhat dramatic tone of the sentence, suitable for a male speaker conveying strong romantic interest. "

      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「〜としても」and the addition of 「よ」soften the statement, making it suitable for a first encounter. The male speaker conveys consideration for the listener's time constraints."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the hypothetical situation introduced by たとえ doesn't change the outcome stated in the main clause. The focus is always on the 'despite' aspect, emphasizing the speaker's determination or belief.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "もしも〜なら・もしも〜でも",
      "nuance": "Unlike たとえ〜ても, which emphasizes concession, もしも〜なら focuses on a direct conditional relationship between two clauses. もしも〜でも adds a further nuance of 'even if' but generally implies a more straightforward conditional relationship than たとえ〜ても."
    },
    {
      "term": "にしても",
      "nuance": "にしても is more versatile, able to express both concessive and additive meanings, while たとえ〜ても is specifically concessive."
    },
    {
      "term": "とも",
      "nuance": "とも is more concise and often used in informal settings, while たとえ〜ても is more formal and emphasizes the hypothetical nature of the situation."
    },
    {
      "term": "たって",
      "nuance": "たって is generally used more informally, and sometimes feels slightly stronger or more emphatic than たとえ〜ても."
    },
    {
      "term": "にせよ・にしろ",
      "nuance": "にせよ・にしろ can express a broader range of meanings including alternatives, while たとえ〜ても is focused on the concession."
    },
    {
      "term": "としても",
      "nuance": "としても can have a slightly more formal or even a deductive feel, while たとえ〜ても emphasizes the concession more directly."
    },
    {
      "term": "ても",
      "nuance": "ても alone is much less formal and emphasizes only the concession; たとえ〜ても is a more fully formed concessive structure."
    },
    {
      "term": "もし",
      "nuance": "もし is a simple 'if' clause, lacking the contrastive force of たとえ〜ても."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the context and desired emphasis.  If you need to express a simple conditional relationship, もし is sufficient.  For a concessive meaning, emphasize the 'despite' element, and carefully choose between たとえ〜ても, にしても, とも, たって, にせよ・にしろ, and としても based on formality and nuance.  Pay attention to the degree of formality and the subtle differences in emphasis among these options."
