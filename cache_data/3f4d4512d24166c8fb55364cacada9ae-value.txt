It's often used when the speaker is seeking confirmation or expressing surprise.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   Gender: While primarily used by males, females might use it in specific contexts to mimic male speech patterns or in very casual settings.\n*   Formality: 「だい」 is very informal and should not be used in formal or business situations.\n*   Alternatives: For females or in more polite contexts, other sentence-ending particles like 「の」 or 「かしら」 might be more appropriate.",
