  "writeup": "いわゆる, sometimes written in kanji as 所謂, precedes nouns to indicate something is 'what is called (A)', 'the so-called (A)', or 'generally known as (A)'.  It combines いわ (a modern variant of いは, the indeterminate form of 言う 'to say') and ゆる (the classical literary equivalent of the auxiliary verb れる, the passive/potential marker in its attributive form). This etymology reflects the literal meaning: 'what is said to be (A)'. Interestingly, the kanji 謂 means 'oral tradition,' emphasizing how something is referred to across time and places.",
  "etymology": "いわゆる is a fascinating blend of classical and modern Japanese.  いわ is a modern shortening of いは, the archaic form of the verb 言う (to say).  ゆる derives from the classical attributive form of the auxiliary verb れる, which marks passive or potential voice. This combination creates a nuanced meaning, suggesting something is commonly referred to or described in a particular way, not necessarily a universally accepted definition. The kanji 所謂 further emphasizes this, as 謂 implies the transmission of knowledge or descriptions through spoken tradition.",

      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "interrogative",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses ね to soften the question, making it more polite and suitable for semi-formal situations.  The use of もの is also a sign of politeness."

    {
      "japanese": "これはいわゆる和製英語というものです。",
      "english": "This is what's called a Japanese English loanword.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the formal です ending and the more formal もの, suitable for formal settings. The explanation itself is generally known information."

      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of ね and の conveys a very intimate and slightly flirtatious tone. The phrase 「運命の人」 adds a romantic touch.  The use of  「あのね」 is common in informal speech between close female friends or a female speaking to a male she's close to."

    {
      "japanese": "今度、君と、いわゆる二人きりの時間、持てたらいいな…",

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses polite language, but the implication is romantic and suggestive.  The speaker is trying to sound casual while keeping a polite and formal tone. The use of  「君」instead of  「あなた」can suggest familiarity and intimacy, while remaining polite enough to not seem overly forward."

      "register": "formal",

    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Note the subtle shifts in formality and connotation depending on context.  The choice between using the hiragana いわゆる or the kanji 所謂 can also reflect the desired level of formality.  In more formal writing, especially academic or professional contexts, the kanji form is often preferred.",

      "term": "というのは",
      "meaning": "~ Known as ~ is, ~ Called ~ is, ~ Means ~, Because",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While both express the idea of something being known or called by a name, というのは adds an explanation or reason, which いわゆる does not necessarily imply.  というのは functions more as a parenthetical explanation."

    {
      "term": "という",
      "meaning": "Called, Named, Known as, As much as",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "という is a simpler way to indicate something's name or what it's called, but it lacks the nuance of common understanding or general knowledge that いわゆる implies."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the subtle differences in meaning.  Use という when simply stating a name or label. Use というのは when providing a definition or reason.  Reserve いわゆる for situations where the thing being described is generally understood or commonly known in a certain way."
