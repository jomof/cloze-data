  "writeup": "て当然だ (te tōzen da) is a common expression signifying that something is natural or a matter of course.  It's a construction combining the て-form of a verb or い-adjective (or で with nouns), the noun 当然 (tōzen, naturally), and the copula だ (da).  Note that て当然だ is a relatively strong phrase, often used to highlight what the speaker considers an obvious fact.  It carries a slightly assertive tone, implying that the outcome is expected and almost inevitable given the preceding circumstances.",
  "etymology": "The phrase is a straightforward combination of established grammatical elements.  \"て\" derives from the て-form, indicating a causal or consequential relationship.  \"当然\" (tōzen) is a noun meaning \"natural\" or \"of course,\" and is of Sino-Japanese origin.  \"だ\" is the copula, asserting a statement of fact.  The combination expresses a strong sense of inevitability linked to the preceding clause.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「あんな生意気なやつ」 (anna seikina yatsu) which is a fairly strong, somewhat disparaging way to refer to someone.  This contributes to the overall assertive tone of the sentence."
    },

      "japanese": "彼女はいつも親切だから、好かれて**当然だ**。",
      "english": "Because she's always kind, it's only natural she's liked.",

      "setting": "Reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「こんなに勉強したんだから」(konna ni benkyou shitandakara) adds a slightly more emotional and self-congratulatory aspect to the statement."

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The phrase 「惚れて当然だ」(horete tōzen da) is a flirty statement. The use of  「よ」(yo) softens the assertion, making it sound less forceful and more playful."
