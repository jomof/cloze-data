    "etymology": "「がけに」comes from the verb 「掛ける(かける)」, meaning \"to hang, to suspend, to start, to begin.\" In this grammar point, it carries the nuance of something being done *in the process* of doing something else, like hanging an action *onto* another.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「がけに」 (ga ke ni) is attached to the ます-stem of a verb to indicate that something is done \"on the way\" or \"while\" doing something else. Although kanji may be used, it is more common to see it written in hiragana. Think of it as doing (B) while doing (A) or because (A) provides a good opportunity to do so. 「掛ける」, from which this grammar point is derived, is a versatile verb meaning \"to hang, to extend, or to place across.\" In this context, it describes the action of doing something along the way of another action.",
