  "etymology": "もさることながら is a fascinating combination of several morphemes.  も (mo) is the particle indicating 'also' or 'even'. さる (saru) is an archaic form of the verb する (suru, 'to do'), meaning 'to be' or 'to exist' in this context.  こと (koto) means 'thing' or 'matter'.  Finally, ながら (nagara) is a conjunctive particle, indicating 'while' or 'although'.  The etymology highlights the layered and nuanced nature of the expression, emphasizing not just a simple 'but also', but a more sophisticated contrast.",
  "writeup": "もさることながら is a sophisticated Japanese expression often conveying 'Not only A, but also, and even more importantly, B'.  It's used in formal settings to highlight a secondary point (B) as even more significant than the initial point (A).  Think of it as a refined way to emphasize a key aspect. The structure's formal nature makes it less common in casual conversations. The literal translation, 'while A is also a matter of importance, B...', helps understand its underlying meaning.  Remember that B always receives stronger emphasis. Its use frequently accompanies intensifying words like さらに (sarani, 'furthermore') or なにより (nayori, 'more than anything').  It's attached to nouns or noun phrases.",
