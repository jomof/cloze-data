  "writeup": "じゃなかった (ja nakatta) is the casual, negative past form of the verb だ (da) meaning 'to be'.  It's a crucial element for expressing something that *was not* the case in the past.  The more polite form is ではなかった (de wa nakatta), which you'll want to use in more formal settings.  Understanding the difference between these two forms is key to navigating Japanese conversational nuance.  The contraction of では to じゃ is a common feature of casual speech. This grammar point is used with nouns and な-adjectives, attaching directly to their dictionary forms to create a past negative statement.  It's a fundamental building block of simple past tense sentences in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "じゃ (ja) is a contraction of では (de wa), the topic marker で (de) plus the negative particle は (wa). なかった (nakatta) is the negative past form of the verb ある (aru) 'to exist' or だ (da) 'to be'. The combination forms a concise way to negate a previous state of being or existence.",

      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The addition of よ (yo) makes the sentence slightly softer.  The older speaker's casual speech (「じゃなかったよ」) shows comfort and familiarity with the younger listener. "

      "nuance": "「んです」 is used to soften the sentence and adds nuance of explanation, suitable for a younger female explaining something to an older female. The casual form is appropriate in the context of a female-to-female conversation among acquaintances."

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "This is a flirty sentence, as it implies a deeper, more complicated affection than a simple dislike. The use of 「あのね」 softens the blow and makes the statement sound less harsh, which is a useful tactic in flirtation.  The phrase 「もっと好きじゃなかったのよ」 is a characteristically female way of expressing a complex feeling."

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that じゃない (ja nai) is for present tense negations, while じゃなかった (ja nakatta) and ではなかった (de wa nakatta) are specifically for past tense negations.  Pay close attention to the tense you are trying to convey."
