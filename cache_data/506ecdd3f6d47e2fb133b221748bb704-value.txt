    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the passive auxiliary verbs れる (reru) or られる (rareru), the noun まま (mama) meaning \"state\" or \"as is\", and the case marking particle に (ni).  The passive form indicates being acted upon, so in this context, it means doing something as a result of being told or ordered. ままに literally translates to \"in the state of\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「れる・られるままに」 expresses the idea of doing something **exactly as one is told or ordered**, without resistance or deviation. Think of it as acting in accordance with someone else's instructions or desires.  The passive forms 「れる」 and 「られる」 highlight that the action is a response to an external influence, often a directive or request.  The 「ままに」 part emphasizes that the action is performed in the **same state** as the instruction was given – that is, without any changes or personal interpretation.  This construction is often used in formal contexts and can sometimes carry a nuance of obligation or lack of autonomy. You will frequently see this paired with verbs of communication like 「言う」 (iu - to say), 「命じる」 (meijiru - to order), 「聞く」 (kiku - to ask), or 「教える」 (oshieru - to teach).  While the particle が (ga) can sometimes appear as 「られるがままに」, it's less common nowadays and adds a subtle sense of acknowledging an alternative while still complying.",

Think of it as a chain of action: someone tells you to do something, and you do it exactly as they said. That's the essence of this grammar point."
