    "writeup": "**がる** is a う-verb that is primarily used as a suffix in Japanese. When used this way, it means \"to act like (A)\" or \"to show signs of being (A),\" where (A) is the word it's attached to. To use **がる**, link it to the stem form of an い-adjective (remove the い), or the stem form of a な-adjective (without the な).

**がる** means \"to give the impression of (A)\" or \"to act like (A).\" This is **important** because you usually don't directly state how someone else feels unless they've told you, and you're quoting them with the particle と. When you want to express how you *think* someone else feels without direct information, **がる** is natural. For instance, seeing someone shiver in the cold.

The main difference between **がる** and **がっている** is that **がる** describes a person's usual behavior, while **がっている** focuses on their actions at a specific moment.

**Important Consideration:** **がる** can also describe yourself (in the third person) when expressing how you believe you act or how you assume others perceive your behavior.

**Fun Fact:** Using **がっている** to express an \"in the moment\" action is becoming less common. **そう** is often used instead to indicate someone \"seems\" a certain way.",
