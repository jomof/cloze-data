        "Register": "This grammar point is relatively versatile and can be used in various contexts, although it leans towards slightly formal or reasoned discussions."
    },
    "writeup": "The structure 「ならともかく」 combines 「なら」, the hypothetical form of 「だ」, with the adverb 「ともかく」, meaning \"to set aside.\" It translates to \"If it were (A), sure, but not in the case of (B),\" or simply \"putting (A) aside, (B).\" It implies that if the condition (A) were true, the outcome would be different, but as (A) is not the case, the situation remains unchanged. 「なら」 functions as an adverbial particle, attaching to the plain form of nouns, verbs, or adjectives, but 「ならともかく」 is primarily used after nouns. The nuance expresses that one situation might be acceptable or understandable, but another is not.",
    "etymology": "「なら」 is the conditional form of the copula 「だ」. 「ともかく」 means \"anyway,\" \"at any rate,\" or \"to leave aside.\" The combination suggests setting aside one possibility to focus on the actual circumstance.",
