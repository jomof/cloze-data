    "writeup": "「自分」 is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of a sentence. It indicates \"oneself\" or \"one's own.\" Importantly, its use often implies a degree of empathy or personal connection from the speaker. It's a versatile word and can be used in various registers, from casual conversations to more formal settings.\n\nConsider these points:\n\n*   When 「自分」 is used, it signals that the speaker is relating to the subject's perspective.\n*   「自分」 can replace other pronouns like 「私」 or 「僕」, but it adds a nuance of introspection or self-reference.\n*   Unlike English reflexive pronouns (*myself, himself, etc.*) 「自分」 can often stand alone as the subject or object of a sentence.",
