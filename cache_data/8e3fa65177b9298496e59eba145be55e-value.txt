    "details": {
        "Register": "General; can be used in both formal and informal settings.",
        "Function": "Nominalizes verbs, adjectives, and sometimes nouns, turning them into nouns that can then be used as subjects, objects, or topics of sentences.",
        "Nuance": "Used to refer to abstract concepts, experiences, or matters rather than concrete objects. It often translates to \"the act of\", \"the matter of\", or \"the thing of.\""
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「こと」originally comes from the verb 「言 (こと)」, meaning \"to say\" or \"to speak\". Over time, it evolved to refer to the content of what is said, and eventually to abstract things, matters, or events in general.",
    "writeup": "The noun 「こと」is used to refer to abstract things, matters, or events. It is often used to nominalize verbs and adjectives, turning them into nouns. It's important to remember that 「こと」refers to intangible concepts, unlike 「もの」, which refers to tangible objects.\n\n*   When used with verbs and *i*-adjectives, 「こと」 directly follows the plain form. For example, 「食べる (taberu)」 becomes 「食べること (taberu koto)」, meaning \"eating (the act of)\". Likewise, 「面白い (omoshiroi)」 becomes 「面白いこと (omoshiroi koto)」, meaning \"(the thing that is) interesting\".\n*   When used with *na*-adjectives, 「な」 is inserted between the adjective stem and 「こと」. For example, 「大事 (daiji)」 becomes 「大事なこと (daiji na koto)」, meaning \"(the thing that is) important\".\n*   When used with nouns, 「の」 is inserted between the noun and 「こと」. For example, 「先生 (sensei)」 becomes 「先生のこと (sensei no koto)」, meaning \"(the thing about) the teacher\".",
