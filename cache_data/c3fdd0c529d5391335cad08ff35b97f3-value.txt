    "etymology": "「甲斐」 originally referred to the effect or result of an action, stemming from the value or benefit derived from it. The 「が」 is a particle indicating the subject, and 「ある」 means 'to exist'. Thus, 「甲斐がある」 literally means 'the worth exists'.",
    "writeup": "「甲斐がある」 is used to express that something is worthwhile or that effort put into something has paid off. 「甲斐」 itself means \"worth\" or \"effect\". The phrase often appears in hiragana (かい or がい) depending on conjugation. 「甲斐がある」 indicates that the 'worth of (A) exists.'\n\n*   When following verbs, 「がい」 is often used after the ます-stem, implying that the action is *always* worthwhile. 「かい」 can be used after any standard form, focusing more on the tense of the verb.\n*   When paired with nouns, 「の」 is required before 「甲斐がある」.\n*   The negative form, 「甲斐がない」, means something is *not* worth doing.\n\n「甲斐がある」 is often used to convey a positive result from something difficult or unpleasant.",
