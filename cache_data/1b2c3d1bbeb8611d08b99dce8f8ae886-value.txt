  "writeup": "だけで combines the adverbial particle だけ and the case-marking particle で.  It's often translated as 'just by (A), (B),' but a more literal rendering is 'with only (A), (B).’ This highlights the で particle's role in indicating the 'tool' used to achieve a result.  Attach だけで to the end of any non-ます-form verb or noun.  A key difference between だけ and しか is that だけ suggests a choice was made from multiple options, while しか implies only one option existed.  Mastering this nuance elevates your Japanese proficiency.",
  "etymology": "The particle だけ (dake) originates from the adjective 只 (tada), meaning 'only' or 'solely.'  The combination with で (de), indicating the means or instrument, creates a concise expression emphasizing the sufficiency of a single action or element.",
