  "writeup": "誰 (dare) is a fundamental interrogative pronoun in Japanese meaning \"who.\"  It's an essential building block for asking about people.  Understanding its usage with various particles is key.  While seemingly simple,  it opens the door to a deeper understanding of Japanese sentence structure and the role of particles.  This lesson will focus on the versatility of 誰 and how context significantly affects its translation. We'll explore its use with particles like が (ga), で (de), に (ni), を (o), and の (no), showcasing how these combinations create different meanings such as \"who,\" \"whose,\" \"somebody,\" and \"everybody.\"  The examples will illustrate these variations in practical contexts.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of 誰 (dare) is quite ancient, tracing back to Proto-Japonic roots.  Its meaning has remained remarkably consistent over centuries, highlighting the stability of core vocabulary in Japanese.",
