  "writeup": "に言わせれば is a grammatical structure attached to nouns to express someone's strong opinion.  It's often translated as \"If you ask (A), (B)\" or \"According to (A), (B)\".  Literally, it means \"If (A) is allowed to speak, (B)\".  This structure combines the particle に, the -u verb 言う (iu, to say), the causative-passive auxiliary verb せる (seru, to allow to do/be allowed to do), and a hypothetical conjunction particle (ば, と, or たら).  Attach it to the noun representing the person whose opinion is being presented. While ば is most common, と and たら are also used.  Using this structure can sound somewhat self-important, so use it judiciously, particularly when expressing your own views.  Occasionally, から replaces に (e.g., から言わせれば).  Remember that the auxiliary verbs せる and させる use に to mark the doer *allowed* to perform the action, while を is usually used when someone *is made* to do something.",
  "etymology": "This construction stems from the verb 言う (iu, to say), transformed by the causative-passive auxiliary せる (seru, to allow/cause to do) to create a hypothetical clause. The choice of ば, と, or たら adds nuance to the degree of hypotheticality or assertiveness.",
