    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にする」 is formed by combining the particle 「に」, which indicates a target or purpose, with the verb 「する」, meaning 'to do' or 'to make.' The 「に」 particle specifies what the action of 「する」 is directed towards, thus giving the combined form the meaning of 'to decide on' or 'to make something into.'",
    "writeup": "「にする」 is a structure that combines the particle 「に」 (indicating a location or target) with the verb 「する」 (to do). It generally means \"to decide on\" or \"to make something into\" something else. The nuance is that the speaker has direct control over the outcome. This is where the strong feeling of 'choice' comes from. The noun that comes before 「に」 is the thing that is being decided upon or transformed.\n\nIn many cases, the common translation is 'to decide,' but it can also be close to the slang expression 'to do (A)' in English. For example, 「ビールにする」 can be translated as 'I'll have a beer' or, more literally, 'I'll make it a beer.'\n\nSometimes the particle 「と」 is used instead of 「に」, like in 「とする」. Although this can have the same meaning, it changes the nuance slightly. When 「と」 is used, it takes away the feeling of being a direct decision. 「とする」 tends to be used in more formal situations, as 「と」 is less 'definite' and results in the phrase sounding less assertive.\n\nComparing 「に」 and 「と」 to English equivalents, it's similar to the difference between the following sentences:\n*   「に」 - I'll buy a burger. (A burger is the direct target of 'buy')\n*   「と」 - I'll go with a burger. (You aren't 'going' anywhere, it just sounds softer)\n\nThis grammar point may be used for more abstract nouns and doesn't specifically need to be 'items.'",
