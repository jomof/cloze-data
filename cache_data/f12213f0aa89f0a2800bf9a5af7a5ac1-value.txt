    "etymology": "Derived from the possessive particle 'の', but in this case, it functions as a pronoun, indicating a substitute for a previously mentioned noun. The nuance implies something that has already been established or is understood by both the speaker and the listener.",
    "writeup": "The pronoun 「の」 acts as a substitute for a noun that has already been mentioned or is understood from the context. It's similar to the English word \"one\" when used to replace a noun. The key thing to remember is that 「の」 in this context **cannot stand alone**; it must be modified by an adjective, verb phrase, or other relative clause to specify which \"one\" you're referring to.\n\nFor example:\n\n*   「私は大きいのを買った」 means \"I bought a big one.\"\n*   「どんな車が欲しいですか。小さいのが欲しいです」 means \"What kind of car do you want? I want a small one.\"",
