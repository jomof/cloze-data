  "writeup": "でなくてなんだろう is a formal expression used after a noun phrase, expressing certainty about something and posing a rhetorical question.  It translates to \"If it's not (A), then what is it?\" or \"If that's not (A), then what else could it be?\". The structure combines the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb だ (で), the conjunctive form of the い-adjective ない (なくて), the interrogative prefix なん (what), and the volitional form of だ (だろう). The addition of か at the end simply emphasizes the rhetorical question without altering the meaning.  This phrase is typically used to strongly assert the speaker's opinion or to highlight the obvious nature of a situation.  It's common in formal settings like essays, news articles, or serious discussions.",
  "etymology": "The phrase is a combination of existing grammatical elements.  で is the conjunctive form of だ, indicating a state of being. なくて is the negative conjunctive form of ない (not). なんだろう combines なん (what) and だろう (a volitional form suggesting a strong assumption), creating the rhetorical question element. The combination expresses a strong conviction.",

      "japanese": "あの子が新しいってだけでいじめられている。あれはパワハラでなくてなんだろう。",
      "english": "She's being bullied just for being new.  If that's not power harassment, then what is it?",
      "register": "Formal",
      "setting": "Serious",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses formal language, appropriate for discussing a serious issue like workplace harassment.  The use of 「あれはパワハラでなくてなんだろう」 asserts the speaker's strong belief that the situation constitutes power harassment."

    {
      "japanese": "俺はこんなに夜遅くまでタダ働きをしている。俺は社畜でなくてなんだろう。",
      "english": "I'm working this late for free. If I'm not a corporate slave, then what am I?",
      "register": "Semi-formal",
      "setting": "Melancholic",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The male speaker uses 「俺は」 which is common for men, expressing frustration and self-deprecation. The use of 「でなくてなんだろう」 conveys a sense of resignation and bitterness; it’s not a question, but a statement of fact couched as a question."

    {
      "japanese": "私の家だけ浸水しなかった。これが奇跡でなくてなんだろうか。",
      "english": "Only my house didn't flood.  If that's not a miracle, then what is it?",
      "register": "Formal",
      "setting": "Reflective",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses more formal vocabulary compared to the first example, creating a more polite and contemplative tone. The addition of 「か」 adds a gentle emphasis to the statement."

      "register": "Formal",
      "setting": "Informative",
      "nuance": "The sentence adopts a formal tone, suitable for a written complaint or report, emphasizing the speaker's certainty regarding the fraudulent nature of the situation. 「なんだろうか」is used here to convey a rhetorical question, implying strong certainty."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの笑顔、本気じゃないとしたら…一体何でなくてなんだろう？",
      "english": "That smile… if it's not genuine, then what is it?",
      "register": "Casual",
      "setting": "Flirty",
      "nuance": "The casual register is reflected in the omission of formal sentence structure and subject pronouns, as well as the use of ellipses, which create a lighter and more suggestive atmosphere.  The use of 「何でなくてなんだろう」 is slightly informal compared to the other examples. It suggests curiosity mixed with intrigue."
