  "writeup": "The grammar point がする describes sensations experienced through senses other than sight.  It emphasizes the *source* of the sensation, making the sensory experience the subject.  Instead of saying 'It smells like roses,' we use  がする to express that the roses themselves are *causing* the rose smell.  Attach がする to a noun phrase indicating the type of sensation.  For example,  バラの匂い (bara no nioi, the smell of roses)  becomes バラの匂いがする (bara no nioi ga suru, it smells like roses).  This construction is versatile, encompassing smells, sounds, tastes, and even feelings.  Interestingly, the Japanese concept of 気 (ki, energy, spirit) is often involved in perceptions, leading to similar usage with ～気がする.",
  "etymology": "The verb する (suru) means 'to do.' In がする, it's less about an action and more about the passive experience of a sensation emanating from a source. The particle が marks the subject, which is the source of that sensation.",

      "english": "This cake tastes sweet, doesn't it?",

      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": "plain",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the casual form 「がするね」and is used between younger friends.  The ね adds a feeling of affirmation, which would sound unnatural in other contexts."

    {
      "japanese": "この部屋、なんだか懐かしい感じ**がする**。",
      "english": "This room gives me a nostalgic feeling.",

      "conjugation": "polite",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「んです」 softens the statement, making it suitable for a polite and somewhat shy confession.  The polite form 「がします」 is crucial here to maintain a respectful tone while expressing feelings."

      "english": "Don't you hear the sound of rain?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "interrogative",
      "conjugation": "negative plain",
      "nuance": "The casual nature of the sentence 「しない？」 is suitable for an intimate setting. The absence of a specific subject makes it sound slightly ambiguous, implying shared experience."

    {
      "japanese": "何か危険な香りが**しません**か？",
      "english": "Don't you smell something dangerous?",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "cautious",
      "conjugation": "negative polite",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「しませんか」 makes the question respectful and polite, inviting a collaborative assessment of a situation, such as detecting danger."

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while がする focuses on the source of the sensation, other constructions exist. You could also use verbs like 感じる (kanjiru, to feel) for a more subjective experience or verbs like 臭い (kusai, to smell) for more direct descriptions of odors. The choice depends on the nuance you intend to convey.",

    {
      "term": "にみえる",
      "meaning": "To look, seem, appear",
      "kind": "antonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike がする, which focuses on sensations other than sight, にみえる describes visual appearances.  にみえる is about how something appears visually, while がする is about how something feels, smells, sounds, or tastes."

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the sense involved.  Use がする for non-visual sensations and にみえる for visual impressions.  Avoid confusion by carefully considering which sense is involved in the situation."
