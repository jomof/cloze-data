  "writeup": "その (sono) is a pre-noun adjectival, a special type of word in Japanese that doesn't conjugate.  It always appears in the same form.  Think of it as a modifier that comes *before* the noun it describes.  The word その is closely related to それ (sore - that), そこ (soko - there), indicating proximity to the listener.  Mastering its usage is crucial for building natural-sounding Japanese sentences.",
  "etymology": "その derives from the demonstrative pronoun それ (sore, 'that').  The addition of the particle の (-no) transforms it into an adjectival form, allowing it to modify nouns. This pattern of adding の to pronouns to create adjectivals is common in Japanese.",

    {
      "japanese": "その本がいい。",
      "english": "That book is good.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "This is a simple, straightforward statement. The use of 「その」 indicates that the book is near the listener."

      "japanese": "その映画、見に行く？",
      "english": "Shall we go see that movie?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The casual register and the question form make it a friendly invitation.  Using 「その」 and adding a question mark 「？」 creates a casual invitation. A male using this to a female suggests informality and a possible romantic interest."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "そのレストランは、ちょっと高いでしょう？",
      "english": "That restaurant is a bit expensive, isn't it?",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "casual",
      "nuance": "The use of 「でしょう」 softens the statement, making it more polite and conversational, suitable for semi-formal settings. The 「その」 shows the restaurant is near the listener."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "すみません、その書類、明日までにいただけますか？",
      "english": "Excuse me, could I have that document by tomorrow?",
      "register": "teineigo",
      "setting": "professional",
      "nuance": "The polite phrase 「すみません」 and the humble request using 「いただけますか」 are appropriate for a professional setting.  The use of 「その」 shows the speaker is referring to a document near the listener."

      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The use of 「あのね」 and the repetition of 「その、あの…」 shows the speaker's nervousness and shyness, which is natural in an intimate confession. The sentence is very informal, as it is using filler words. This is typical of shy younger speakers to those they like."
