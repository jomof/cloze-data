    "etymology": "The term 「ずくめ」 comes from the verb 「尽(つ)く」 (tsuku), meaning \"to exhaust\" or \"to use up entirely,\" combined with the suffix 「め」, which often indicates a collection or state.  Therefore, 「ずくめ」 implies a state of being filled entirely with something, or a collection consisting only of that thing. The shift from 「づ」 to 「ず」 is a common sound change in Japanese.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「ずくめ」 means \"completely,\" \"entirely,\" or \"nothing but.\" It attaches directly to nouns to express that something is entirely composed of or characterized by that noun.  Think of it as saying something is \"all in\" on a particular aspect.  For example, 「黒ずくめ」 means \"all in black\" or \"dressed entirely in black.\" While the older form 「づくめ」 exists, 「ずくめ」 is the standard and preferred usage today. It's important not to confuse this with 「尽(づく)し」 which means \"all sorts of\" or \"a variety of.\"",
