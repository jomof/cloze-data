  "writeup": "Probably is an adverb that originally stems from the conjugation of the yodan verb, 恐る 'to fear'.  In most cases, 恐らく is simply used as a formal way to say 'probably' or 'perhaps', and is usually partnered with other structures of conjecture such as だろう, かもしれない, etc.  As 恐らく behaves adverbially, it will most often appear at the beginning of sentences before a statement of conjecture is made. Although 恐らく can, and often does, carry the meaning of 'I fear that (A)', it isn't necessarily always used in relation to negative things. In this grammar pattern, the main nuance that 'I fear that (A)' conveys is modesty on the speaker's part; they fear their assumption may be correct, given the available information.  A fun fact: yodan, or 四段活用, verbs are a type of classical Japanese verb that has been largely replaced by godan (う-verbs) in modern Japanese.",
  "etymology": "おそらく (osoraku) comes from 恐らく (osoraku),  a contraction of 恐る (osoru, 'to fear') + べく (beku, a conditional suffix).  This reflects its original meaning of 'I fear that...', implying a degree of uncertainty or apprehension about the statement that follows.  The evolution to a more general adverb of probability highlights the subtle shifts in meaning that Japanese words can undergo over time.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "妻は今夜会社の人たちと飲み会に行くと言っていたので、おそらく11時ごろぐらいまでは帰ってこないと思います。",
      "english": "My wife said she was going to a drinking party tonight with some people from work, so I think she probably won't be home until around 11:00.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses polite language, appropriate for discussing family matters. The speaker's use of 「と思います」(to omoimasu, 'I think') further emphasizes politeness and uncertainty."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あいつの不自然な行動からして、おそらくあいつが犯人だろう！",
      "english": "Judging by that guy's unnatural behavior, he's probably the culprit!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "serious",
      "nuance": "The use of 「あいつ」(aitsu, 'that guy') shows informality and a degree of contempt. The exclamation point reflects strong certainty despite using the word \"probably\"."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "おそらく明日は雨かもしれないので、明日予定していたピクニックは中止しましょう。",
      "english": "Perhaps it may rain tomorrow, so let's cancel the picnic we had planned.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The sentence structure combines \"osoraku\" with \"kamoshirenai\", layering the uncertainty.  The suggestion to cancel is polite and considerate."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "恐らく彼はここにいないだろう。",
      "english": "He most likely isn't here.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "This is a more concise and informal version, replacing the longer explanation with a more direct statement. The use of  だろう adds further implication of conjecture."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "恐らく明日雨が降る。",
      "english": "I fear that it will rain tomorrow.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The use of 恐らく directly emphasizes the speaker's apprehension. It's a subtler way of expressing a high probability than simply saying it will likely rain. The sentence structure is simple and direct."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼だったら、恐らくこんなことできっこないでしょう。",
      "english": "If it were him, he probably couldn't do this.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "persuasive",
      "nuance": "The conditional construction highlights a counterfactual element.  The polite form 「でしょう」 (deshou) adds a layer of indirectness suitable for polite conversation. The use of 「できっこない」(dekikonai) implies impossibility, suggesting confidence in the speaker’s inference."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "私の兄は恐らく１１月頃アメリカから帰ってくるでしょう。",
      "english": "My older brother will probably be back from America around November.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "This sentence is polite and neutral, suitable for general conversation.  The use of 「でしょう」 (deshou) implies a high degree of certainty while maintaining a formal tone."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "代表者によりますと大統領は恐らく再選にねらうまい。",
      "english": "According to a representative, the president will most likely not seek re-election.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The sentence structure is formal and indirect, fitting for reporting on political matters. The phrasing emphasizes the source of the information.  The formality is heightened by the use of 「によりますと」(ni yorimasu to) and the negative nuance of 「ねらうまい」(neraumai)."
    },
        {
      "japanese": "ねえ、もしかしたら…　今夜は、私の部屋で、一緒に…　おそらく…　楽しい夜になると思うんだけど…",
      "english": "Hey, maybe... tonight, in my room, together... probably... I think it'll be a fun night...",
      "register": "shitashii kuchō",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「ねえ」(nee) creates an intimate and casual tone suitable for flirting.  The hesitant and suggestive phrasing, including the ellipses and repetition of \"probably\", builds romantic tension. The implication is sexually suggestive."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Note the flexible nature of 恐らく; while often paired with other expressions of uncertainty, it can also stand alone, depending on the context and desired level of formality. The nuance of apprehension or fear is often subtle and depends heavily on the overall tone and content of the sentence.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "かもしれない",
      "meaning": "Might, Maybe, Perhaps",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike 恐らく, which suggests a higher probability based on evidence or inference, かもしれない indicates a more general possibility."

    {
      "term": "もしかしたら",
      "meaning": "Perhaps, Maybe, Possibly",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "もしかしたら expresses a weaker degree of probability than 恐らく. It suggests a less informed guess or a more tentative assumption."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the level of certainty you wish to convey. 恐らく implies a higher likelihood based on observation or deduction. かもしれない suggests a more open possibility, and もしかしたら presents the weakest probability among the three."
