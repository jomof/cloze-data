  "writeup": "を兼ねて is a grammatical pattern utilizing the verb 兼ねる (kaneru), meaning 'to combine,' 'to double as,' or 'to do concurrently.'  The particle を marks a noun representing a secondary action or state, while 兼ねて indicates the primary action or state performed concurrently.  It's often translated as 'to (A) at the same time as (B),' 'to double as (A),' or 'to (A) also partly for the purpose of (B).'  Importantly, を兼ねて usually emphasizes (B) as the main goal, with (A) serving as a supporting action, a logical accompaniment, or a convenient justification for (B). To better grasp the secondary nature of (A), consider the literal translation 'while extending to (A), (B).'  For multiple goals, the particle と is used to list them.  This construction is versatile and appears in various registers.",
  "etymology": "The verb 兼ねる (kaneru) originates from the verb 兼ねる (kaneru) meaning 'to be shared' or 'to overlap'.  The modern usage of を兼ねて reflects this original meaning of overlapping actions or purposes.",
