    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないほうがいい」 is composed of: 「ない」, which is the negative form of a verb; 「ほう」 (方), meaning 'direction' or 'way'; 「が」, a particle; and 「いい」 (良い), meaning 'good'. Together, it suggests that 'not doing' something is the better 'way'.",
    "writeup": "「ないほうがいい」 is used to give advice, suggesting it's better *not* to do something. Similar to 「たほうがいい」, this expression implies that one choice is preferable. The phrase consists of the negative form of a verb + 「ほうがいい」, where 「方」 means \"way\" or \"direction.\" This expression is quite direct and can imply potential negative consequences if the action is performed. The negative implications of 「ないほうがいい」 are much stronger than just advising what 「たほうがいい」.",
