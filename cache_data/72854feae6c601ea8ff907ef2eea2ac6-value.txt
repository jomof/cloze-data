    "etymology": "The adverbial particle ばかり originally comes from the word 「許(ばかり)」, which can also be written as 「計(ばかり)」. The kanji 「許」 means \"to permit\" or \"to allow\". This etymology suggests the nuance that only the action or state preceding 「ばかり」 is being exclusively permitted or occurring.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「ばかり」 indicates that **only** the preceding noun or verb is applicable, or that **nothing but** the preceding action is being performed.  When attached to a verb, it follows the て-form (てばかり). It's common to see 「てばかりいる」, which emphasizes the continuous nature of the action, but 「てばかり」 alone also conveys this meaning.  When 「ばかり」 connects two clauses, it's typically followed by 「で」 after nouns or verbs, or 「いて」 after verbs.  Remember that the 「で」 here is the conjunctive form of the copula 「だ」, not the particle 「で」. While rarely written in kanji, understanding its origin from 「許り」 can provide deeper insight into its meaning, highlighting the exclusivity of the action or state.",
