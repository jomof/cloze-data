  "writeup": "なら〜で is a grammatical structure used to express a speaker's dissatisfaction or implied criticism when an action is performed incompletely or inappropriately.  It translates roughly to \"If you're going to [action], then you should do it properly.\" or \"Before you [action], you should have [done something else].\"  The structure typically repeats the verb or adjective, emphasizing the incompleteness.  For instance, \"食べるなら食べるで、きちんと食べなさい\" (If you're going to eat, then eat properly!).  This highlights the speaker's frustration with the inadequate execution of the eating.  This construction is versatile and can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. Both なら and で function as conjunctive particles, subtly conveying the speaker's implied criticism.  It's crucial to distinguish なら〜で from similar structures like ば〜で;  the nuances differ significantly in expressing whether something poses a problem or not.  This pattern is most often used following な-adjectives.",
  "etymology": "This structure leverages the core meaning of なら (if) and で (in the process/manner of). The repetition emphasizes the incompleteness or inappropriateness of the action, making the implied criticism stronger.",
