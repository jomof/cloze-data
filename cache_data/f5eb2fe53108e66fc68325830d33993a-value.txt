    "etymology": "The grammar point is constructed from the volitional form of a verb (よう), the particle と, and the verb する (to do) in its negative form (しない). It literally means 'does not do with the intention of [verb]'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[volitional-よう] + **としない**」 expresses a lack of willingness or effort to do something. It emphasizes that someone is not making an attempt or effort to perform the action indicated by the verb. \n\n*   It combines the volitional form of a verb (e.g., 食べよう *tabeyou*, let's eat) with the particle 「と」 and the negative form of the verb 「する」 (**しない**, *shinai*, do not).\n\n*   It is generally used to describe **someone else's** unwillingness or lack of effort, rather than your own. Using it to describe yourself can sound abrupt or rude. To express your own lack of intent, consider using 「ようと思わない」 instead.\n\n*   **Important Consideration:** This expression often carries a negative connotation because it implies a deliberate choice not to act.",
