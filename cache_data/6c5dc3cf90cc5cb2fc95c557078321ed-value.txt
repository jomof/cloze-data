    "etymology": "The particle 「を」 originally had a broader range of functions, including marking direct objects and locations.

It always marks the starting point of the movement, and is typically used with verbs that indicate movement such as 「出る」 (to leave), 「離れる」 (to separate), and 「降りる」 (to get off). Think of it as pinpointing *where* the action starts.",
