    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てすみません」 combines the 「て」-form of a verb with 「すみません」. The 「て」-form here indicates the reason or cause for the apology expressed by 「すみません」.  「すみません」 itself comes from the verb 「済む」 (すむ), meaning \"to finish\" or \"to be completed\". The negative form 「すみません」 implies that something is not finished or is left undone, often carrying a sense of regret or obligation.",
    "writeup": "「てすみません」 is a polite grammatical structure used to express apology or regret for something that has already occurred. The 「て」-form of a verb indicates the reason for the apology.  It literally conveys a sense of 'something is not finished because of [the action of the verb]'. This conveys a feeling of responsibility or regret. While the direct translation is often \"I'm sorry for...\", it carries a nuance of acknowledging the inconvenience or trouble caused by the action. This expression is suitable for use in most polite situations. It's a standard way to apologize for past actions.",
