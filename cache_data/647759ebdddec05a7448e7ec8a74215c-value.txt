  "writeup": "ならいざ知らず (narai za shirazu) is a nuanced Japanese expression combining hypothetical なら (nara, ‘if’), the emphatic いざ (iza, ‘well then’), and the negative 知らず (shirazu, ‘not knowing’).  It translates roughly to  \"I don't know about that, but...\" or \"Maybe in that case, but...\".  It's used to create a contrast:  one situation is uncertain or irrelevant, while another is definitively true.  The structure emphasizes this contrast, highlighting the certainty of the second clause despite the uncertainty of the first.  **Important:**  While similar to a 'but' construction, it doesn't directly translate to 'but' as it emphasizes the *difference* in certainty between the clauses.  It's typically found in formal settings and often carries a slightly dismissive or even exasperated tone. This is because the first clause is often an extreme or irrelevant case, emphasizing the contrast with the second clause.  It's primarily used by older generations and those familiar with more classical Japanese.",
  "etymology": "This phrase's strength lies in its combination of classical elements.  なら (nara) stems from the classical conditional form of the copula だ (da). いざ (iza) is an adverbial particle retaining its classical feel, emphasizing a decisive shift in thought. 知らず (shirazu) is the negative form of the verb 知る (shiru, 'to know'), further reinforcing its classical roots and the nuanced meaning of ignorance in the first clause.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "１万円は社会人ならいざ知らず、小学生にとっては想像を絶する金額だ。",
      "english": "10,000 yen is an unimaginable sum for an elementary school student, but I don't know about adults.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「小学生にとっては想像を絶する金額だ」 which emphasizes the vast difference in financial understanding between adults and children. The formality comes from the overall construction and the use of 「想像を絶する」.  The older speaker is likely educating the younger listener about relative financial values."

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The speaker uses 「いいんじゃない？」 which is a slightly softened, informal expression used to encourage agreement. The overall register is semi-formal, leaning towards casual due to the conversational tone.  The speaker's age is apparent in the somewhat condescending yet gentle advice."

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "older",
      "nuance": "The polite 「かわいそうすぎますよ」 shows consideration and concern. The formality of 「ならいざ知らず」 maintains politeness, while 「かわいそうすぎますよ」 adds a softer edge to the expression of concern. The speaker's greater experience is implied, providing context for the advice given."

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「わ」 is a typical female speech ending. The implied meaning of 「そんなこと」leaves a flirty, suggestive nuance.  The casual register and female speech pattern create an intimate and gossipy tone.  The contrast highlights the speaker's boldness in private versus restraint in public."
