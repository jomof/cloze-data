  "etymology": "「じゃなかった」 is the casual past negative form of the copula 「だ」 (the plain form). 「だ」 is often contracted to 「じゃ」 in casual speech, evolving from 「では」. Therefore, 「じゃなかった」 is essentially a contracted and casual equivalent of 「ではなかった」, reflecting the historical shift from 「では」 to 「じゃ」.",
  "writeup": "「じゃなかった」 is the casual past negative form of the copula 「だ」. While 「では」 is the more formal counterpart of 「じゃ」, 「じゃ」 itself is a common contraction of 「では」 in spoken Japanese, making 「じゃなかった」 a frequently encountered structure.\n\nThis grammar point is used to express the negative past of both **nouns** and **な-adjectives**. You simply attach 「じゃなかった」 directly after the noun or the stem of a な-adjective (e.g., 静かじゃなかった).\n\nFor more formal or polite contexts, variations exist:\n*   **「ではなかった」**: This is a slightly more formal version of the plain negative past, often found in writing or more formal spoken contexts.\n*   **「じゃありませんでした」**: This is the polite negative past form, derived from the polite copula 「です」 combined with the negative 「ありません」 and the past tense auxiliary 「でした」.\n*   **「ではありませんでした」**: This is the most formal polite negative past form, typically used in very polite or formal situations.",

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "A younger male might use 「思ったより」 for casual comparison. The phrase 「静かじゃなかった」 demonstrates the negative past of a な-adjective, `静か`, emphasizing that the shop was not quiet, contrary to expectations."
