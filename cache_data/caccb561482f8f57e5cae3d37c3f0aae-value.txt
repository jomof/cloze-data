  "writeup": "といわれている, often translated as \"it is said that\" or \"it is known as,\" is a useful phrase for conveying commonly held beliefs or opinions.  It's constructed by combining the particle と (to), indicating a quoted phrase, with the passive form of 言う (iu, to say).  The passive form, われる (wareru), indicates that the saying is not attributed to a specific person but rather represents general consensus.  Unlike とされている (to sarete iru), which focuses on the resulting state or fact, といわれている (toiwareteiru) emphasizes the act of quoting or referencing a common statement. This grammatical structure is frequently used both with and without the kanji for 言う (iu), as the meaning remains consistent regardless.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's core is the verb 言う (iu, to say).  The passive form われる (wareru) shows that the statement originates from an unspecified source, creating the sense of widespread belief. The particle と (to) functions as a quotative marker, encapsulating the preceding clause as something being said.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "大阪のたこ焼きは日本一美味しい**といわれている**。",
      "english": "It's said that Osaka's takoyaki is the most delicious in Japan.",
      "register": "Standard",
      "setting": "Informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "This sentence presents factual information in a neutral tone.  The use of 「大阪のたこ焼き」 (Osaka's takoyaki) immediately grounds the statement, and the passive form 「といわれている」 (toiwareteiru) avoids assigning the statement to a specific person or group."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "このラーメン屋は、行列ができるほど人気がある**といわれている**。",
      "english": "This ramen shop is said to be so popular that there are always lines.",
      "register": "Standard",
      "setting": "Informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the phrase 「行列ができるほど」 (to the point of having lines), which adds descriptive detail to the popularity claim. The structure remains simple and factual, as with the first example."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの人は、とても優しい人**だといわれている**。",
      "english": "That person is said to be very kind.",
      "register": "Semi-formal",
      "setting": "Informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "This sentence demonstrates the flexibility of using 「といわれている」 (toiwarete iru) to describe character traits. The descriptive adjective 「優しい」 (yasashii) is naturally incorporated into the construction, again without explicit attribution."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あのカフェは、デートに最適な場所**といわれている**よ。",
      "english": "That cafe is said to be the perfect place for a date, you know.",
      "register": "Casual",
      "setting": "Flirty",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of よ (yo) at the end adds a light, casual tone.  The phrase 「デートに最適な場所」 (perfect place for a date) is a subtle invitation, demonstrating how the grammar point can be used in a more suggestive context. The casual nature is reinforced by the use of よ (yo)."

      "japanese": "彼は、仕事ができる**といわれている**けど、実際はどうかな？",
      "english": "He's said to be very capable at work, but I wonder what's really going on?",
      "register": "Casual",
      "setting": "Reflective",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "This example shows a more nuanced use where the speaker expresses uncertainty. The 「けど」 (kedo) adds a contrasting thought, revealing the speaker's own reservations. The casual tone is evident in the directness and implied question."

      "japanese": "この映画は、感動する**といわれている**んですけれど…",

      "register": "Teineigo",
      "setting": "Informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The polite ending 「んですけれど」 (n desu keredo) softens the statement and adds a tentative tone.  It shows that the speaker is mindful of being polite, suggesting a formal setting or a situation requiring deference."

  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the context and added phrases significantly influence the overall implication of the sentence. While the core of the grammar point remains consistent, it adapts flexibly to various tones and styles.",

    {
      "term": "そうだ",
      "meaning": "I heard that, It is said that",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike といわれている, which implies a widely held belief, そうだ suggests information received from a specific source and often carries a less certain tone."

    {
      "term": "とかんがえられている",
      "meaning": "Is considered, Is thought of as",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While both phrases convey common opinions, とかんがえられている emphasizes a more deliberate judgment or assessment, while といわれている focuses on the act of stating something."

      "term": "という (each)",
      "meaning": "Called, Named, Known as, As much as",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "Choosing between these similar phrases hinges on the nuance you intend to convey.  If the focus is on widespread belief without a specific source, といわれている is ideal. If the source is somewhat known, そうだ is better, and if the emphasis is on judgment, consider とかんがえられている.  The meaning of という differs significantly.  Use it for naming or describing rather than describing a common saying."
