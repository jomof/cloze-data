  "writeup": "どうしても is a crucial Japanese expression, often treated as an adverb meaning \"no matter what,\" \"regardless of,\" or \"absolutely.\"  It's a combination of どう (dō, 'how') and the ても (te mo) form of する (suru, 'to do'), literally suggesting 'even doing.'  This seemingly simple phrase holds significant weight in conveying the speaker's unwavering conviction.  It typically appears at the sentence's beginning, emphasizing the absolute nature of the following statement.  Alternatively, it can follow a verb with the particle と (to), indicating an unavoidable consequence. For example, \"牛乳を飲むとどうしてもお腹が痛くなる\" means \"If I drink milk, I inevitably get a stomach ache.\"  It's important to note that the nuances of どうしても depend heavily on context. The \"in any case\" meaning is also prevalent.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of どうしても is straightforward. It's a combination of the adverb どう (dō, meaning 'how' or 'in what way'), and the ても (te mo) form of the verb する (suru, meaning 'to do').  The ても form indicates a concessive condition, essentially meaning 'even if' or 'no matter how.' Therefore, どうしても literally translates to something like 'no matter how one does it,' but its meaning has evolved to express a sense of inevitability or determination.",

      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "instructional",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a semi-formal register, appropriate for a slightly more formal setting like instructing a subordinate or a slightly older person. The phrase 「自分で買いなさい」 (jibun de kainasai) adds to the directness of the instruction."

      "english": "Whenever I drink milk, I always get a stomach ache.",

      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The casual speech with 「～ちゃう」(chau) and the sentence-final particle 「んだよね」(n da yo ne) indicates a younger speaker sharing a relatable experience with someone they're close to. The slightly whiny tone comes from the  「～なくなっちゃう」(nakunacchau), implying a sense of helplessness."

Using the wrong expression can alter the meaning subtly, so it's vital to understand these subtle differences to express yourself accurately."
