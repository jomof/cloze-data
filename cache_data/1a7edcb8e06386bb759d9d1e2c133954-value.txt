    "etymology": "The word 「ふう」 comes from the kanji 「風」 (kaze), meaning \"wind\" or \"air.\" In this grammatical context, it carries the nuance of \"appearance\" or \"manner,\" suggesting something is done or appears in a particular style or way.",
    "writeup": "「ふうに」 is a suffix in Japanese used to indicate that something is in the style, manner, or method of what comes before it. It commonly appears in kana. This use of 「ふう」 appears following verbs, and functions similarly to a な-Adjective. This means it's followed by 「に」 when used adverbially to describe something being done \"in the way of (A).\"  It's also common to see 「ふうに」 after pre-noun adjectival words like 「こんな、そんな、あんな」 to highlight that something is done \"like this,\" \"like that,\" etc. Think of it as having \"an air of\" something, though the overlap isn't 100%.",
