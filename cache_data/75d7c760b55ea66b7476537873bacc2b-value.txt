    "etymology": "The verb 「来る (くる)」 has ancient roots in the Japanese language. Its origin can be traced back to the Old Japanese period, where it was likely used with a similar meaning of movement towards the speaker or a specific location. Over time, the pronunciation and written form have evolved, but the core meaning has remained consistent. The kanji 「来」 itself is a pictographic representation of wheat, which was 'brought' to Japan in the early days.",
    "writeup": "「来る (くる)」 is a fundamental verb meaning \"to come.\" It indicates movement toward the speaker or a place associated with the speaker's perspective. Unlike regular Godan and Ichidan verbs, 「来る」 is a *k*-column irregular verb (カ変動詞), meaning its conjugation patterns are unique. The 「る」 is dropped during conjugation, and the remaining 「く」 changes depending on the form.\n\nKey points to remember:\n\n*   「来る」 often takes the particles 「に」 or 「へ」 to specify the destination. For example, 「学校に来る (がっこうにくる)」 means \"to come to school.\"\n*   「来ている (きている)」 can mean either \"to be somewhere one has come\" or \"to be coming,\" depending on context. Note the difference in nuance between 「来ている」 and the simple present form.\n*   「来ている」 is typically used for temporary locations, not for places like home or work where you regularly are.",
