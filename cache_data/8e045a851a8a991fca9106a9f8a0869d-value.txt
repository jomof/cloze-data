    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てよかった」 is derived from the te-form of a verb (showing a completed action or state) followed by 「よかった」, which is the past tense of the い-adjective 「いい」 (good). Therefore, it literally translates to \"it was good that...\" implying a sense of relief or satisfaction about a past action or event.",
    "writeup": "The 「てよかった」 grammar point expresses a feeling of relief or satisfaction that something happened or did not happen. It's essentially the speaker saying, \"I'm glad that...\".\n\n*   **Positive Form**: \[Verb (て-form)] + よかった expresses happiness that something *did* happen.\n*   **Negative Form**: \[Verb (negative て-form)] + よかった expresses happiness that something *did not* happen. Both 「なくてよかった」 and 「ないでよかった」 are used, with 「ないでよかった」 being more common in casual speech.\n\nKeep in mind that the nuances between 「なくてよかった」 and 「ないでよかった」 are subtle. 「ないでよかった」 is much more frequently used in daily conversation. 「なくてよかった」 may seem more formal, reserved for books or considered old-fashioned by some.",
