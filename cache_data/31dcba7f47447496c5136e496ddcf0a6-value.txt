    "writeup": "より～のほうが is used to express a preference or to state that one thing is more of a certain quality than another.  Think of より as meaning \"than\" in this context, and のほうが as indicating the preferred or more prominent option. The basic structure is **[noun A] より [noun B] のほうが [adjective]** or **[noun A] より [noun B] のほうが [adjectiveな]**. This structure translates to \"[Noun B] is more [adjective] than [noun A].\"\n\n*   **より**: Indicates the item being compared against.\n*   **のほうが**:  Highlights the item that possesses the quality to a greater extent.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The adjective at the end describes the quality being compared.\n*   While が is the most common particle before のほうが, を can be used, particularly with verbs expressing desire like 「たい」 or 「ほしい」.  Using を emphasizes the object of desire more directly.",
