  "writeup": "The particle こと (koto), often written in kanji as 事, functions as a nominalizer, transforming verbs into noun phrases.  It's similar to のは but functions differently; こと is a noun itself, translating roughly to 'the thing that is (A),' where (A) represents the action of the verb.  You simply attach こと to the dictionary form (masu-less form) of a verb. While this explanation focuses on the dictionary form,  こと can actually follow any verb form besides the polite ます form.  A common usage involves adding ない (nai) before こと to create a negative statement.  While other auxiliary verbs can be used, ない is the most frequent.  A noteworthy nuance: when a short sentence ends with こと, it often implies a rule or command.  In this case, こと functions as a sentence-ending particle, and is rarely written in kanji. This particle form, however, shares its origin with the nominalizer こと. Unlike もの (mono), another noun meaning 'thing,' こと frequently describes intrinsic aspects – feelings, conditions, events—things describable but not always directly observable.",
  "etymology": "The word こと comes from the ancient word 事 (koto), meaning 'matter,' 'thing,' or 'event.'  Its use as a nominalizer developed over time, reflecting the evolution of Japanese grammar toward more concise expression.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "近所の迷惑になることをしてはいけない。",
      "english": "You mustn't do things that will annoy the neighbors.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses a negative imperative, \"してはいけない (shite wa ikenai)\", making it a clear instruction.  The use of \"迷惑 (meiwaku)\" adds a touch of politeness, suitable for a semi-formal setting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ファックスをすることが嫌いだ。",
      "english": "I hate faxing.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of \"嫌いだ (kirai da)\" is a casual way of expressing dislike.  The sentence is simple and direct, common in casual conversation."

      "japanese": "お金を使い過ぎないことが大事だ。",
      "english": "It's important not to overspend.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Again, \"大事だ (daiji da)\" is a casual expression.  The negative form \"使い過ぎない (tsukai suginai)\" is crucial to the meaning and adds naturalness to the sentence."

    {
      "japanese": "日本語を話すことは難しいことだ。",
      "english": "Speaking Japanese is a difficult thing.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "academic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The addition of \"ことだ (koto da)\" at the end provides emphasis.  The use of more formal grammar fits the academic setting."

    {
      "japanese": "スポーツをすることが好きだよ。",
      "english": "I love playing sports!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",

      "english": "Seeing your smile is my happiness.",
      "register": "intimate",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "「君の笑顔 (kimi no egao)」—using \"君 (kimi)\" to address the listener is intimate and adds a personal touch; \"僕の幸せ (boku no shiawase)\"—the use of \"僕 (boku)\" is a slightly more casual way for a male speaker to refer to himself in an intimate setting. This is a good way to begin a conversation."

      "japanese": "一緒に映画を見に行くことはどう？",
      "english": "How about going to see a movie together?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of \"どう？ (dou?)\" is a casual way of asking a question, commonly used in a first-date or casual setting; it's a great way to subtly invite a date without directly asking."
