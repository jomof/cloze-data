  "writeup": "The adverb 直ちに (tadachini) is commonly used in Japanese to convey immediacy—something happening 'immediately' or 'at once'.  Its placement is usually at the beginning of a sentence, a typical characteristic of adverbs.  A fascinating detail: stemming from the kanji 直 (naosu, meaning 'to straighten' or 'direct'), 直ちに often carries the subtle nuance of something being done 'directly' and purposefully, often in response to a preceding event or action. To describe immediate events that are *not* intentional, consider using 忽ち (たちまち, tachimachi).",
  "etymology": "直ちに (tadachini) is composed of 直 (naos) meaning \"straight,\" \"direct,\" or \"correct,\" and ちに (-ni), a suffix indicating the adverbial form. The sense of directness and immediacy is inherent in the etymology, indicating a swift and purposeful action.",
