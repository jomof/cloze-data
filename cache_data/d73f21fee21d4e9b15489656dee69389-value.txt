  "writeup": "よ, pronounced \"yo\", is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese.  Its primary function is to add emphasis, often indicating that the speaker is conveying new information to the listener. It's attached to the end of a sentence, much like other sentence-ending particles. While typically used for new information, it's also frequently paired with ね (ne) to form a phrase akin to \"right?\" or \"isn't it true?\", expressing agreement or seeking confirmation.  This combined usage creates a softer, more conversational tone.  This use, in particular, should be noted.  It should be obvious, but the use of よ differs significantly from other sentence-ending particles.  Unlike some particles which subtly shift the register of speech, よ adds significant new emphasis. Consider also that the usage of よ with nouns and adjectives follows normal rules for noun and adjective conjugation, which should already be familiar to the student.  Mastering よ is crucial for natural-sounding Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of よ is complex and not definitively settled, but it's believed to have evolved from earlier sentence-final particles that expressed emphasis or assertion.  Its modern usage retains this core function of highlighting new or important information.",
