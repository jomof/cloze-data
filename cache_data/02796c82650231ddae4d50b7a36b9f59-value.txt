    "etymology": "って is a colloquial contraction of the particle と. Therefore, it carries the same core function of marking a quote or content of thought, but with a more informal tone.",
    "writeup": "って is a casual version of the particle と used to quote something. In Japanese, this use is called 引用 (in'you), which means \"reference\" or \"citation.\" って is almost exclusively used after direct quotations and followed by a verb indicating the type of communication used, such as 言った (itta, said), 思った (omotta, thought), or 聞いた (kiita, heard).\n\nJust like with と, the verb that comes after って is frequently omitted, even more so because casual language tends to omit many things.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\nAlthough often heard, because って is very casual, it can be unnatural in sentences that also use the polite です or ます structures. However, if the conversation is formal but friendly (like between a senpai and a kouhai), most people would consider it normal.",
