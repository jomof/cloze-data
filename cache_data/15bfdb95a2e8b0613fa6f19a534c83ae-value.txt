  "writeup": "お～願う (o-negai) is a humble speech expression in Japanese used for making requests.  It functions similarly to お～ください ('please do (A)') but conveys a more deferential tone.  Like many polite structures, お (o) is used with native Japanese words, while ご (go) is used with words of Chinese origin. 願う (negai) itself is a  う-verb meaning 'to petition,' so the literal translation is something like 'I petition that you do (A) for me.' While this sounds stiff in English, it highlights the act of asking a favor.  Due to its politeness, お～願う almost always appears in its ます-form, お～願います (o-negai shimasu).  Interestingly, loanwords from Western languages (katakana words) often omit お and ご, simply adding 願う to the end.  **Caution:** Because お～願う is even more polite than お～ください or てください, it's rarely used in casual conversation.  Using it in daily speech might sound sarcastic or overly formal.",
  "etymology": "願う (negai) comes from the verb 願ふ (negafu), an ancient form meaning 'to wish' or 'to pray.'  The 'o-' prefix is an honorific particle used to add politeness and respect to the request. The structure reflects the hierarchical nature of Japanese communication, emphasizing respect for the listener.",
