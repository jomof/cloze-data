    "etymology": "The word 「せい」 comes from 「所為」 (shoi), which literally means \"doings\" or \"actions.\" It implies that something negative has occurred as a result of someone's actions or some external factor's influence.",
    "writeup": "The noun 「せい」, written 「所為」 in kanji, conveys that a negative result occurred due to the behavior or actions of another person/thing. It carries a nuance of blame or fault. Common translations of 「せい」 are \"fault,\" \"due to,\" or \"because of.\" Because 「せい」 is a noun, it follows the attributive form of other words. The particle 「で」 is often used after 「せい」, indicating the (B) result occurred 'with' or 'by means of' those 'doings'. For example, 「不況のせいで」 (because of the recession) or 「寝不足のせいで」 (due to lack of sleep).",
