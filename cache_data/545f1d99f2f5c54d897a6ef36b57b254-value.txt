  "writeup": "は別として is a set phrase meaning 'setting aside (A)', 'except for (A)', or 'save for (A)'.  It combines は, 別 (a noun meaning 'difference', 'separation', or 'distinction'), と, and the て-form of する.  More literally, it means 'going ahead with (A) as an exception', essentially disregarding (A) before discussing the main point.  Since は marks the topic, this phrase can follow a noun or any word typically used with は, including phrases like かどうか.  Repeating (A) in both positive and negative forms ('whether or not') is common, similar to かどうか. Although this grammar point removes (A) from the discussion, (A) is usually an exception to a rule or constant the speaker wants to highlight.  Note: は別として may sometimes be replaced by は別にして, with minimal nuance change.  と sounds more definitive, while に suggests intentional separation of (A).",
  "etymology": "The phrase's core is the noun 別 (betsu), meaning 'difference' or 'separation'.  The particle は (wa) sets it as the topic, と (to) indicates a conjunction, and し て (shite) is the te-form of する (suru), 'to do'.  The overall meaning arises from combining these elements to indicate something being set aside or excepted.",
