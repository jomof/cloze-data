    "etymology": "だに comes from the classical Japanese particle 'だに' which originally conveyed a sense of limitation or the minimum extent of something. Its use has evolved to emphasize the minimal action needed to trigger a significant result or feeling.",
    "writeup": "だに is an adverbial particle similar in meaning to さえ and すら, meaning \"even\", but is more common in classical literature. It presents (A) as a 'minimum' or 'light' example, implying that anything greater than (A) would be more than can be handled or imagined. In this usage, it translates to \"just (A)\" or \"merely (A)\". だに directly follows verbs in their dictionary form.\n\nThis is a formal structure, more often found in literature but also used in anime and manga to add dramatic effect. Because (A) represents a 'minimum,' it often depicts the difference between reality and fantasy. For instance, 想像するだに (even in my imagination), imagination is the 'minimum,' with 'in reality' at the opposite end of the spectrum.",
