    "etymology": "The etymology of 「ね」 is not definitively known, but it's believed to have evolved from older sentence-ending particles. Its function has remained consistent: to seek confirmation or agreement.",
    "writeup": "「ね」 is a sentence-ending particle used to seek agreement or confirmation from the listener. It's similar to a tag question in English, like \"right?\" or \"isn't it?\". It's typically added to the end of a sentence. Unlike 「な」, which expresses the speaker's own thoughts, 「ね」 aims to establish a shared understanding or opinion. 「ね」 is often combined with 「よ」 (よね) when you strongly expect the listener to agree with you. Keep in mind that 「ね」 can be weaker than 「でしょう」 or 「だろう」 and sometimes used habitually.",
