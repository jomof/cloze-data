  "writeup": "The particle だけに (dakeni) is a nuanced expression often used to convey a sense of expectation or consequence.  It literally translates to 'only because,' but its meaning is richer. It implies a natural or logical connection between a cause and effect.  Think of it as adding emphasis to the reason behind a particular outcome.  It's used after verbs, adjectives (い-adjectives and な-adjectives preceded by な), and nouns, always highlighting the reason why something happened or is the way it is.  It can emphasize both positive and negative consequences.  The key is understanding that the outcome is directly attributable to the preceding clause.  For example, \"He's a professional, so he's naturally skilled.\"  In this case, 'being a professional' (the preceding clause) is the reason why his skill level is high (the consequence).  While seemingly simple, mastering だけに requires sensitivity to context to fully convey the implication of 'logical consequence' and the slight emphasis added.",
  "etymology": "だけに (dakeni) is a combination of だけ (dake), meaning 'only' or 'just,' and に (ni), a particle indicating reason or cause.  The combination creates a subtle but powerful expression that conveys a direct causal relationship, often highlighting the expected outcome.",
  "examples": [

      "japanese": "トムさんは日本語を8年勉強している**だけに**、日本語がペラペラだ。",
      "english": "Tom has been studying Japanese for 8 years, so it's only natural that he's fluent.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「日本語がペラペラだ」 to describe Tom's fluency, a natural consequence of his eight years of study.  The structure is straightforward and informative."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "このアパートは東京駅に近い**だけに**、家賃が高い。",
      "english": "This apartment is close to Tokyo Station, so the rent is naturally high.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence connects the proximity to Tokyo Station (positive aspect) with high rent (negative consequence).  The だけに particle emphasizes the logical connection between location and cost."
    },

      "japanese": "彼は子供の頃からそろばんを習っている**だけに**、暗算がとてもうまい。",
      "english": "He's been studying the abacus since childhood, so naturally he's very good at mental calculation.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This example illustrates the use of だけに to explain a skill developed over time.  The skill is a direct result of his training. The description 「暗算がとてもうまい」 is a natural consequence shown by the だけに particle."

      "japanese": "忙しい**だけに**、ゆっくり休んでください。",
      "english": "Because you're busy, be sure to take your time resting.",

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The speaker uses 「可愛い顔をしている」 to emphasize the reason, which is playful and gossipy. The use of ね at the end is typical of casual female speech. The flirty nature of this statement is clearly due to the subject matter."

    {
      "japanese": "君と会える**だけに**、今日は最高に幸せだよ。",

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a very intimate statement using 「最高に幸せだよ」 (I am supremely happy), expressing strong feelings. The use of 君 (kimi) instead of あなた (anata)  adds to the intimate nature of the statement, used primarily amongst close people."

      "nuance": "The formal register is used for a more serious tone, focusing on a negative consequence of fame.  The use of 「プライバシーが守られない」 (privacy is not protected) clearly states a negative aspect."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the nuance of だけに rests in the clear causal link between the preceding clause and the following statement.  The unexpectedness or emphasis on the outcome isn't always explicitly negative; it can also highlight a positive outcome that is directly related to the preceding cause.",

      "term": "わけだ",
      "meaning": "For that reason, No wonder, As you'd expect, Naturally, Thus, This is why",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While わけだ also expresses a logical consequence, it often implies a more explicit explanation or reasoning, whereas だけに emphasizes the direct connection between cause and effect with a touch more of expectation."

    {
      "term": "だけあって",
      "meaning": "Is only natural, …Being the case, Because, As might be expected",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "だけあって is very close to だけに, but it tends to focus more on the qualities inherent in the first clause.  For example, 'He is a skilled craftsman, so it's not surprising his work is excellent.'  The 'skill' is a inherent quality, versus the direct causal link in だけに."

    {
      "term": "だけのことはある",

      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "だけのことはある implies a confirmation of a known quality leading to an expected result,  emphasizing the quality's fulfillment, whereas だけに focuses more on the direct cause-and-effect relationship."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "Distinguishing between these similar expressions requires attention to the subtle differences in emphasis.  わけだ provides a reason, だけあって emphasizes inherent qualities, and だけのことはある confirms expected results based on known qualities.  だけに, however, directly links cause and effect, with a subtle hint of expectation."
