  "writeup": "ように～てほしい is a versatile expression combining the auxiliary verb ようだ (yō da) with the てほしい (te hoshii) structure.  Since ようだ is linked to a following verb, it takes the adverbial form ように (yō ni). This construction expresses a desire that someone perform an action 'in the manner of' something else, or that they achieve a state or ability.  The particle に (ni) commonly marks the person whose action is desired, while が (ga) often marks events or objects.  However, flexibility exists; に and が might be switched for stylistic reasons to avoid repetition or ambiguity.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n* The use of に or が depends on the context. It's usually に for people and が for events/objects, but there can be exceptions.\n* This phrase is commonly used in both informal and formal settings, adapting the politeness level based on the overall context of the sentence using different conjugations of 'てほしい'.",
  "etymology": "The structure originates from the combination of two distinct grammatical elements. よう (yō) derives from the verb ようだ (yō da), meaning 'to seem,' 'to appear,' or 'to be like.'  The addition of に (ni) changes it into an adverbial form, indicating manner or style. てほしい (te hoshii) is a polite request form constructed using the て-form of a verb plus ほしい (hoshii), signifying desire or wanting something to happen.",
