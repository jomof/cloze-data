  "writeup": "から (kara) is a particle indicating origin or starting point.  It's a fundamental N5 grammar point, crucial for expressing location, time, or source.  Think of it as the Japanese equivalent of the English preposition 'from.'  It's straightforward and widely used in everyday conversation. The word directly follows the noun denoting the starting point.  The key to understanding から is to recognize its core meaning as 'from', even when the English translation might seem slightly different in the context of a sentence.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Unlike the English 'from,' から doesn't inherently imply movement or change.  For example, \"アメリカから来ました\" (Amerika kara kimashita - I came from America) implies movement, but \"この本は図書館から\" (Kono hon wa toshokan kara - This book is from the library) describes origin without any motion.\n*   This basic use of から is distinct from other uses of から, such as the causative 'cause' or 'because' usage, which require additional grammatical structures.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of から is complex and debated.  However, some scholars suggest a connection to the verb 枯れる (kareru - to wither, to fade), suggesting an original meaning related to something beginning from a state of decline or absence. This relates to the conceptual sense of \"from\" as an origin, a point of departure.",

      "japanese": "東京**から**来ました。",
      "english": "I came from Tokyo.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Slightly more formal than the previous example.  The word 「東京」 (Tokyo) is the starting point.  Using 東京 instead of a more casual option implies formality."

    {
      "japanese": "彼**から**プレゼントをもらった。",
      "english": "I received a present from him.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This shows the origin of the present.  The use of から is natural and unassuming."

      "english": "I really like the present from him.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This showcases an easy and natural way to express appreciation. The 'from him' part is smoothly integrated using から.  The choice of 「気に入ってる」 (ki ni itteru) is an informal, friendly way to state this. "

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "This flirty sentence uses polite language 「待ってたんです」 (matteta n desu), softening the directness of waiting.  The use of 「あなたから」 (anata kara) adds a personal touch, highlighting the sender's importance.  A male speaker would likely use a different expression such as  「メール、待ってたぜ」 (me-ru, matteta ze)."

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "This intimate sentence uses informal language and 「あのね」(ano ne), a filler word often used in close relationships, to create a comfortable tone. The use of 「すごく嬉しかった」(sugoku ureshikatta) expresses intense joy. Only used between very close friends or people who are romantically involved."

  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion between から and てから, focus on whether you're indicating a simple origin or a sequence of actions.  てから always refers to the completion of an action before the next starts. から only shows an origin; there is no sequential action necessarily involved."
