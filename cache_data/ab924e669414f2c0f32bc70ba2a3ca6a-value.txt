    "etymology": "The particle 「ね」 is thought to have originated from the interjection 「ねえ」, which expresses a feeling of agreement or confirmation. Over time, it evolved into a sentence-ending particle used to seek agreement from the listener.",
    "writeup": "The sentence-ending particle 「ね」 is used to seek confirmation or agreement from the listener. It's often translated as \"right?\" or \"isn't it?\" in English. Simply add 「ね」 to the end of a sentence to invite the listener to share your sentiment or confirm your understanding. It is less assertive than 「でしょう」 or 「だろう」 and can be used almost habitually. It is considered standard register.",
