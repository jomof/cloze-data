  "writeup": "どれ, pronounced \"dore,\" belongs to the こそあど (kosoado) words—a family including これ (kore, this), それ (sore, that), and あれ (are, that over there). Unlike its siblings, which specify a particular item, どれ is inherently interrogative, asking about something unspecified from a group of three or more.  It translates to \"which\" in English, and is often used with the particle が in questions, though は is used when どれ follows a noun.  Note that for choices limited to two, どちら (dochira) or どっち (docchi) are preferred. This preference is a linguistic evolution; historically, どれ could have been used in such cases.",
  "etymology": "The word どれ likely evolved from a combination of the demonstrative pronoun roots and an interrogative element.  Its connection to other kosoado words shows its shared origins in indicating location or proximity. The shift towards its exclusive use in questioning appears to be a relatively recent linguistic development.",
