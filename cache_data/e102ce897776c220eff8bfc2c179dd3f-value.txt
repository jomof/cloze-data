  "writeup": "わけにはいかない combines わけ ('reason' or 'cause') with に (case marking), は (adverbial), and 行かない ('cannot go').  It translates roughly as 'cannot afford to (A)' or 'impossible to (A),' but more literally means 'it cannot be so that (A).' This structure follows the non-past verb form, highlighting an undesirable or unattainable action. While usually emphasizing undesirable actions,  it can also express a desirable but impossible one, depending on context and tone.  The nuance is similar to the English 'I guess it's just not meant to be,' conveying a sense of regret.  It's used in standard Japanese across genders and ages.",
