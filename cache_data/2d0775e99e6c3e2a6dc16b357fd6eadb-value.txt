    "writeup": "A fairly old-fashioned phrase, **上は** highlights that something is being done or considered as a result of (A). It can be interpreted as \"once (A), (B)\", \"since (A), (B)\", \"now that (A), (B)\", or \"as long as (A), (B)\". In these meanings, (B) will always be something that is deemed as either obvious or necessary. The **上** in this phrase is a noun and is attached to the adverbial particle **は**. This creates a literal meaning similar to \"over and above (A), (B)\". This \"over and above\" has a similar nuance to \"with that said\" or \"all things considered\" in English, presenting (A) as something finalized. This structure follows verbs in the standard form. Due to **上は** being quite old-fashioned, expressions like **からには** or **以上は** are heard more frequently in modern Japanese and carry a similar meaning.",
