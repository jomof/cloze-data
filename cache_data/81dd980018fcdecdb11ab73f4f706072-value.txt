  "etymology": "The word \"次第\" (shidai) itself means \"circumstances,\" \"depending on,\" or \"as things stand.\"  It's derived from the verb \"次ぐ\" (tsugu), meaning \"to follow\" or \"to succeed.\"  The suffix \"-次第\" indicates that something happens after or as a consequence of something else.  In this grammatical structure,  \"次第です\" adds a layer of polite explanation, softening the blunt delivery of a reason.",
  "writeup": "The polite phrase \"次第です\" (shidai desu) elegantly explains a situation or reason. It follows a verb in its dictionary form and is often used in formal settings or when speaking to superiors. It's similar to saying \"This is because...\" or \"The reason is that...,\" but more nuanced and polite.  The \"です\" ending makes it polite; using \"だ\" would sound abrupt and inappropriate in most contexts.   This construction is favored in formal communication and demonstrates respect for the listener.  It's less frequently used in casual conversation.",
