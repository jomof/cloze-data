    "etymology": "「事 (koto)」 refers to a 'thing', 'matter', or 'event'. When combined with the particle 「に (ni)」, in this context, it intensifies the preceding statement, indicating that something is happening to a significant degree or extent. It emphasizes the 'thing' that is being felt or experienced.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ことに」 is used to emphasize the degree or extent of a feeling or emotion. It conveys the sense of 'extremely', 'especially', or 'to my... (surprise, joy, etc.)'.  It is **important** to note that 「ことに」 in this usage is primarily used with words describing feelings or emotions.  Literally, 「A ことに B」 can often be understood as \"to a (significant) extent regarding A, B\". A common set phrase using this grammar is 「幸いなことに (saiwai na koto ni)」, which translates to \"fortunately\" or \"luckily\".  It's worth noting that 「ことに」 can also be used with the kanji 「殊に (koto ni)」, which functions adverbially and means \"particularly\" or \"especially\" in a more general sense, not necessarily tied to emotions.",
