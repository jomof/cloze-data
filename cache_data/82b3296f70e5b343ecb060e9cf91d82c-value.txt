  "writeup": "The grammar point \"にしたがって\" (ni shitagatte) is formed by combining the particle \"に\" (ni) with the て-form of the verb \"従う\" (shitagau), meaning \"to follow\" or \"to comply with.\"  This construction indicates that something happens *in accordance with* or *as a consequence of* something else. It's a formal expression, often used in written Japanese or more formal settings. The action described after \"にしたがって\" is usually a gradual or continuous change resulting from the preceding event or condition.  Think of it as a more formal and nuanced version of other similar expressions like \"につれて\" (ni tsurete).  The nuance is crucial: it suggests a stronger causal link and formality.  It's less about simultaneous change and more about a clear cause-and-effect relationship.  Mastering \"にしたがって\" elevates your Japanese to a more sophisticated level.",
  "etymology": "The grammar point is derived from the verb 従う (shitagau), meaning \"to obey,\" \"to follow,\" or \"to comply with.\" The combination of the particle に (ni) and the て-form of 従う (shitagatte) creates a nuanced expression of following or according to something. The formal register is a result of its origin in more formal contexts of following rules, guidelines, etc.",
