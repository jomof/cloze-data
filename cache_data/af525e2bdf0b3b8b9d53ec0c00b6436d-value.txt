  "writeup": "The Japanese expressionに限って (ni kagitte) is a fascinating grammatical structure with three main uses.  It conveys a sense of irony, limitation, or exception. Think of it as highlighting a frustrating coincidence, a specific restriction, or an unusual pattern. Common translations include \"particularly when,\" \"those who,\" and \"only when,\" but the best choice depends heavily on context.  This phrase combines に (ni), a particle indicating a point of reference, and the て-form of the verb 限る (kagiru), meaning \"to limit.\" Let's explore the nuances of each use:\n\n* **Irony/Coincidence:**  This meaning implies an unexpected or unfortunate turn of events.  It highlights that something usually doesn't happen, but it inexplicably *does* happen under a specific circumstance.\n* **Limitation/Restriction:** Here,に限って specifies that something applies *only* to a particular person, thing, or situation, excluding all others. \n* **Unusual Pattern/Exception:**  This use indicates that while something is generally true, a specific exception exists. It emphasizes the unusual nature of that exception.  \n\nMastering this phrase requires sensitivity to the underlying context. While translations like 'only when' can be helpful starting points, understanding the underlying implication of irony, limitation, or exception will significantly improve your comprehension and fluency.  Let's look at examples to illustrate these various uses.",
  "etymology": "The word 限って (kagitte) comes from the verb 限る (kagiru), meaning \"to limit\" or \"to restrict.\"  The て-form (kagitte) functions as an adverbial modifier, expressing the exceptional or limited nature of the situation.",

      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「うちの子」 (uchi no ko), which is a casual way of referring to one's own child, highlighting the casual register. The expression of disbelief, 「考えられない」(kangaerarenai), further reinforces the casual, yet serious tone."
