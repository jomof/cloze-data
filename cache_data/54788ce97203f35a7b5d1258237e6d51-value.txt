    "meaning": "Not only...but also; much more than; in addition to.",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Formal",
        "Usage": "Used to indicate that something is not only the case, but something more extreme or unexpected is also true. The part before 「ばかりか」is typically something expected, while the part after is more surprising.",
        "Emphasis": "Adding 「さえ」after 「ばかりか」 further emphasizes the unexpected nature of the latter part of the statement. 「さえ」 means 'even'.",
        "Parts of Speech": "Connects nouns, verbs, or adjectives.",
        "Nuance": "The speaker expresses surprise or emphasis at the additional fact presented after 「ばかりか」."

    "etymology": "「ばかり」means 'only' or 'just', while 「か」is a question particle. Together, they create a rhetorical question implying that the statement is not just limited to the first part, but extends further. Adding 「さえ」 amplifies the unexpectedness or extremeness of the second part of the statement.",
    "writeup": "「ばかりか」 is used to express that not only is something the case, but also something more significant or surprising is true. It connects nouns, verbs, or adjectives, indicating an additional fact, often with an element of surprise. 「ばかりか」 is more formal than 「だけでなく」. Adding 「さえ」 emphasizes the unexpectedness. Essentially, it conveys \"not only A, but even B\". The part before 「ばかりか」 is typically something expected, while the part after is more surprising.",
