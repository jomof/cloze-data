  "writeup": "というところ is a grammar expression used to indicate an approximate number or degree. It combines the particle と, the verb 言う (iu) 'to say', and the noun ところ (tokoro) 'place, point'.  Common translations include 'I would say about (A)', 'I guess about (A)', or 'It could be said that (A)'. A more literal translation is 'To be at the point where saying (A) is accurate'.  This structure typically follows verbs, nouns, or adjectives and usually appears at the end of sentences, often followed by the auxiliary verb だ (da) or です (desu).  Occasionally, 言う (iu) is replaced by its past-tense form, といった (iita), without changing the meaning.  Important Consideration: というところ tends to suggest a theoretical maximum rather than a minimum.  Therefore, it might sound unnatural when expressing an approximate minimum.",

  ],
  "etymology": "The etymology of というところ lies in the combination of three core elements: と (to), a particle indicating a quoted phrase or clause; いう (iu), the verb meaning \"to say\"; and ところ (tokoro), a noun indicating a place, point in time, or situation.  The expression's meaning arises from the combination, literally conveying the idea of \"being at the point where one would say...\"",
