  "writeup": "The past tense of る-verbs is formed by removing the final る and adding the auxiliary verb た (plain) or ました (polite).  While seemingly simple, understanding the nuance of た is crucial.  It doesn't *just* indicate past tense; it can also signal completion or continuation of a state.  Think of it as encompassing \"did,\" \"was,\" \"had been,\" or \"had done.\"  The polite form, ました, adds politeness to the past tense action. This is not just a single past tense marker; the politeness is from ます.  This politeness is always maintained with ました regardless of the verb to which it's attached. Mastering this distinction is essential for expressing the precise timing and politeness level in your Japanese sentences.",
  "etymology": "The past tense marker た is derived from the verb とる (toru) meaning \"to take,\" \"to pick up,\" or \"to get.\"  Its evolution into a purely grammatical marker is a fascinating example of semantic shift in language.  The polite form, ました, combines ます (masu), a politeness marker, with た, highlighting the evolution of politeness markers in Japanese grammar.",
