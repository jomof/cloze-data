    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ているあいだに」 expresses that **an action or event (B) occurs within the duration of another ongoing action or state (A)**.  Think of it as "(B) happened sometime during (A)".  The 「いる」 form (ている) indicates a continuous action. 「間に」(あいだに) literally means \"interval\" or \"between,\" emphasizing that the second event happens within the timeframe of the first.  The two events don't need to be directly related. Often, the (B) action is something unexpected or outside the speaker's direct control, but this is not a strict rule.",

Understanding these subtle differences will help you choose the most appropriate expression."
