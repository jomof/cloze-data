  "writeup": "The particle てから indicates that one action occurs after another.  It's often translated as \"after doing...\" or \"once...then...\"  The key difference between てから and simply using the て-form followed by another verb lies in the emphasis. てから highlights the causal relationship—the first action *enables* or *precedes* the second.  This nuance isn't always captured in direct translations.  While から can follow various verb forms, てから specifically conveys this sequential, cause-and-effect relationship.  Other forms like たから and るから often translate to \"because\" or \"since.\" This is a standard, versatile particle suitable for most situations and genders.",
  "etymology": "てから is a combination of the て-form (a conjunctive form indicating completion or preceding action) and から (a particle indicating the starting point of time or cause). The combination elegantly expresses the completion of one action before another. It reflects Japanese's focus on sequential actions and their relationships.",
