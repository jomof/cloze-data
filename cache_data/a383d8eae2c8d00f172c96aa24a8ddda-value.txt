    "etymology": "「が」 indicates the subject of the verb 「ある」, which means \"to exist\" or \"to have.\" When combined, they create a relative clause describing the following noun.",
    "writeup": "This expression uses 「がある」 to describe a noun that follows it. The structure 「(A) がある (B)」 translates to 「(B) has/with (A)」. This functions as a relative clause, similar to an adjective, modifying the noun. In English, relative clauses often require pronouns like \"who,\" \"which,\" or \"that.\" However, Japanese does not require these words; the noun directly follows 「がある」.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   In a relative clause, (B) is considered the main topic/subject because (A) describes it. Therefore, 「は」 is generally not used in place of 「が」. However, 「の」 can be used instead of 「が」 to show the relationship between (A) and (B).",
