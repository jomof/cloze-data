  "writeup": "でしかない is a grammatical construction in Japanese meaning \"merely,\" \"nothing but,\" or \"no more than.\"  It's formed by combining the continuative form of だ (で), the particle しか, and the negative adjective ない.  This structure emphasizes the limited or insignificant nature of something.  Crucially, でしかない directly follows nouns, differentiating it from similar expressions. While it can convey both positive and negative connotations, it often carries a subtly negative nuance, implying a lack of value or importance beyond what's stated.  Mastering this construction adds depth to your Japanese expression.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of でしかない stems from the combination of three core elements: で (de), a particle indicating a state or condition; しか (shika), a particle restricting the scope to only a specified amount or thing; and ない (nai), the negative form of the copula verb.  The interaction of しか, which implies limitation, and ない, which indicates negation, creates the sense of something being limited and insufficient in some way.",

    {
      "japanese": "それは言い訳**でしかない**。",
      "english": "That's merely an excuse.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses \"それ\" (sore), which is a pronoun that is gender neutral, though it may feel less formal in everyday conversation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の言葉は慰め**でしかない**だった。",
      "english": "His words were nothing but consolation.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "sympathetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The past tense emphasizes that the consolation was not effective or meaningful in the long run. The use of \"言葉\"(kotoba), and \"慰め\" (nagusame) are gender neutral terms.  The semi-formal register is appropriate for the slight distance in a sympathetic situation."

    {
      "japanese": "私にとって、彼はただの友達**でしかない**。",
      "english": "To me, he's just a friend.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The speaker is a female, and her use of \"私\" (watashi) is very polite and gender neutral. But the casual register comes from the use of \"ただの友達\" (tada no tomodachi), which is very common language."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この計画は夢**でしかない**。",
      "english": "This plan is nothing but a dream.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "pessimistic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses \"この計画\" (kono keikaku) and \"夢\" (yume) which are both gender neutral. The casual register matches the pessimistic setting."

    {
      "japanese": "君にとって、私はただの知り合い**でしかない**のか？",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The sentence is casual and uses \"君\" (kimi), a familiar term of address, in a casual way.  The question is flirty, but tinged with vulnerability, common among younger women in certain settings. The use of \"私\" (watashi) is polite even in a flirtatious context."

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The intimacy of this sentence comes from the use of \"あなた\" (anata) combined with the possessive \"あなたにとって\"(anata ni totte).  The word \"遊び相手\" (asobi aite) is inherently flirtatious. This is common language for females to use when flirting."

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The intimate register is achieved through the use of \"あのね\" (ano ne) which is a common opening in intimate female speech. It's softened further by \"ただの友達\"(tada no tomodachi), common female language to make the flirting subtler."

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While にすぎない and しか～ない share similarities with でしかない, their usage differs subtly.  To avoid confusion, carefully consider whether you're emphasizing limitation of options (しか～ない), a general limitation (にすぎない), or the inherent inadequacy of something (でしかない).  The grammatical position of the phrase after a noun is another way to easily identify でしかない."
