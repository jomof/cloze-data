  "writeup": "The particle phrase \"にして①\" is a nuanced grammatical structure in Japanese, combining the particle \"に\" with the \"て-form\" of the verb \"する\".  It's used to highlight a specific point in time, circumstance, or condition as the pivotal moment from which a subsequent event or state arises.  It often translates as \"at,\" \"over,\" \"in,\" or \"only (after, when, or because).\"  The emphasis is on the significance of this particular point—it's not just a simple temporal marker.  The preceding element typically involves a time period, age, number of attempts, or a significant event. The subsequent clause describes the consequence or state resulting from this pivotal point. Frequently, words like やっと (yattoo, finally) or 初めて (hajimete, for the first time) further emphasize the achievement or realization achieved only *after* or *because of* the specific condition expressed by にして.  This structure adds a layer of weight and emphasis beyond a simple temporal description, focusing on the defining nature of the starting point and its consequent effect. This structure is commonly used in formal contexts.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of にして stems from the combination of the particle に (ni), indicating location or circumstance, and the て-form (te-form) of する (suru, to do).  The て-form connects actions or states, in this case linking the pivotal condition to its consequence.  This combination has evolved to carry this unique nuanced meaning of focusing on a specific, significant point in time or situation.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "３０歳にして初めて海外旅行に行った。",
      "english": "At age 30, I went on an overseas trip for the first time.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the plain past tense. The nuance lies in highlighting the age of 30 as the critical point at which the speaker undertook the first overseas trip. The plain tense makes it a relatively neutral statement."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "５回目にしてやっと資格を取ることができた。",
      "english": "On the fifth try, I finally got the qualification.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence emphasizes the difficulty of the task by highlighting the fifth attempt as the crucial point where success was finally achieved. The use of やっと further underscores the long and arduous process.  The plain past tense remains relatively neutral."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼は５０歳にして、ようやく自分の夢を実現した。",
      "english": "At 50 years old, he finally realized his dream.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence is similar to the prior example and uses a formal register.  The emphasis on the age of 50 makes it clear that the achievement was only attained after many years of effort. The formal register suggests respect for this achievement, or perhaps a certain gravity to the event."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "一瞬にして、彼女は私の心を奪ってしまった。",
      "english": "In an instant, she stole my heart.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「一瞬にして」 and the casual register creates a spontaneous and passionate feeling.  The verb 「奪ってしまった」 (ubatte shimatta) adds a sense of being completely captivated, which could be considered a more passionate or forceful way of expressing this thought than using something like  「奪ってしまった」 instead.  This illustrates a male speaker expressing romantic interest."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "初めて会った日に、彼女ににして、恋に落ちた。",
      "english": "The day I first met her, I fell in love.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "This sentence is quite straightforward.  The use of 「初めて会った日に」 (hajimete atta hi ni) combined with 「恋に落ちた」 (koi ni ochita) is a common way to express this idea in Japanese. The sentence could be spoken by a man to a woman he is pursuing romantically."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "今にして思えば、あの時もっと頑張れば良かったと後悔している。",
      "english": "Looking back now, I regret not trying harder then.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The phrase 「今にして思えば」 (ima ni shite omoeba) sets the stage for a retrospective reflection. The regret is expressed clearly, using the conditional form implicitly,  emphasizing the missed opportunity. The semi-formal register makes it suitable for a variety of situations, neither overly casual nor extremely formal."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Note that while the meaning of にして often involves a sense of 'only after' or 'only when', the emphasis remains on the critical point in time or circumstance. It is crucial to understand the context to fully grasp the implied meaning.",
