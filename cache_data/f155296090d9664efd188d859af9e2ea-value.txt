  "writeup": "The word 代わり (kawari) means \"substitute\" or \"replacement.\"  This grammar point, 代わりに (kawari ni), indicates that something is being done or used *instead of* something else.  The particle に marks the substitute.  The structure is flexible and can be used at the beginning or within a sentence.  It's commonly used in everyday conversations and across different registers, making it a versatile tool.  Understanding its nuance requires attention to context and the implied relationship between the two things being compared.  For example,  \"代わりに\" can suggest an equal exchange, a compromise, or simply an alternative.",
  "etymology": "代わり (kawari) itself combines 変 (hen, change) and 代 (dai, generation, period).  It literally points to a change in a given 'generation' or instance—something taking the place of another.  The に particle indicates that the following phrase is the substitute.",
