    "meaning": "One; a thing; used to replace a noun when the noun is understood from context.",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Informal. More common in speech than in writing.",
        "Usage": "Used to avoid repeating a noun that is already clear from the context. Can be modified by adjectives or relative clauses.",
        "Function": "Acts as a pronoun replacing a noun. Indicates 'one' or 'thing' with the described quality or characteristic."
    },
    "etymology": "This usage of 「の」 is derived from the possessive particle 「の」, indicating that the thing being referred to 'belongs to' or is 'associated with' a certain quality or description.",
    "writeup": "The pronoun 「の」 functions as a substitute for a noun that is already understood in the conversation. It is often translated as \"one\" or \"thing.\" It's a dependent pronoun, meaning it **must** be modified by an adjective, a relative clause, or some other descriptor. This avoids repetition and makes sentences more concise. For example, instead of saying 「私は赤いりんごを買いました」 and then 「私は赤いりんごが好きです」, you can say 「私は赤いりんごを買いました。その**の**が好きです」, replacing the second mention of \"red apple\" with 「の」.",
