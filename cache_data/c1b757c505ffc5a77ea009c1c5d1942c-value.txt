  "writeup": "次第 is a noun that's often translated differently depending on the preceding word.  This lesson focuses on its use with the conjunctive form of standard verbs and the stem of する-verbs. While technically a noun, it functions like a suffix in many cases.  Essentially, it means 'next in sequence after (A),' often translated as 'as soon as (A).'  A crucial point about 次第 is its literal meaning: 'determining sequence.' This differs significantly from English equivalents and emphasizes that (A) governs (B). Let's examine this with various word types:\n\n* **Verb + 次第:** The verb dictates the sequence of (B).  Since verbs don't 'choose,' (A)'s occurrence triggers (B).\n* **Living Noun + 次第:** The noun determines the sequence of (B).  As living things make choices, (B) depends on (A).\n* **Inanimate/Abstract Noun + 次第:** The noun determines the sequence of (B).  Inanimate/abstract entities don't choose; (A) dictates (B)'s course of action, often involving a decision.",
