    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed by combining the particle 「と」 with different conjugations of the verb 「する」 (to do). 「したら」 is the past conditional form, 「すれば」 is the conditional form (ba-form), and 「すると」 is the plain form followed by 「と」. The 「と」 particle marks the preceding clause as a condition or assumption.",
    "writeup": "The grammar points 「としたら」, 「とすれば」, and 「とすると」 are used to express a hypothetical situation and its potential result. While there are subtle nuances, they are generally used interchangeably to mean \"if it were the case that (A), then (B)\" or \"assuming that (A), then (B)\".\n\nTo use these expressions, simply attach 「と」 and your chosen variation of 「する」 to the end of a verb in its plain form, an い-adjective, or a noun/な-adjective followed by 「だ」. It is similar to 「もし」, but a bit more formal.",

Consider the context carefully to choose the most appropriate expression."
