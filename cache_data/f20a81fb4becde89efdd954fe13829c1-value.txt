    "writeup": "それにしても is an expression used in Japanese as an extension of にしても \"even though\" or \"even if\". This grammar pattern can be translated as \"nevertheless\" or \"even so\", and it emphasizes that despite what was said previously, the speaker's main opinion or feeling is expressed in the following statement.  In most cases, それにしても highlights that while the speaker acknowledges or accepts the previous statement as true, there's more to consider. それにしても typically appears at the beginning of a sentence or directly after a comma. Because it's used when the speaker is already aware of or accepts situation (A), the following clause (B) often highlights something that is above and beyond that expectation.",
