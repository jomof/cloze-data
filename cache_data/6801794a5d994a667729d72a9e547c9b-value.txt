  "writeup": "The sentence ending particle とは (to wa) expresses surprise, disbelief, or unexpectedness.  It's like saying, \"To think that...\" in English, emphasizing the unexpected nature of the preceding statement.  It's a combination of the quotative particle と (to) and the topic-marking particle は (wa).  This highlights the entire preceding clause as surprising.  While often used without explicitly stating the speaker's emotion, the surprise is strongly implied.  Sometimes, とは follows expressions like など (nado, 'such as'), broadening the scope of the surprising element to something 'like' the stated clause. Although it's common to omit the explicit emotional reaction, the speaker might add an exclamation afterwards to amplify the feeling.",
  "etymology": "とは is a combination of the quotative particle と (to), indicating something is being quoted or referred to, and the topic-marking particle は (wa), which sets the topic of the sentence.  The combination creates a unique emphatic structure highlighting the unexpectedness of the topic.",
