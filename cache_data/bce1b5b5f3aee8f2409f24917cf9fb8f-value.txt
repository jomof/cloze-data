  "writeup": "The Japanese grammar point \"ばかりに\" (bakari ni) translates to \"simply because,\" \"only because,\" \"just because,\" or \"simply on account of.\"  It emphasizes a cause-and-effect relationship where the cause is unexpectedly minor or insufficient to justify the effect.  The particle \"に\" (ni) marks the cause, which is often presented as something seemingly trivial or insignificant.  \"ばかり\" (bakari) itself suggests a limited extent or quantity, implying that the effect is disproportionate to the cause. This phrase usually, but not always, expresses a negative or unfortunate outcome. It's commonly used with past-tense verbs, highlighting a regrettable consequence of a preceding action.  Attach \"ばかりに\" to the end of a word in its attributive form.  This grammar point isn't gender- or age-specific and is used across various regions of Japan.",
  "etymology": "The most frequent kanji used for ばかり is the same as the kanji for 許す (yurusu), 'to forgive.'  In this context, 許 means 'to permit' or 'to allow through,' suggesting a minimal threshold.  This nuance is preserved in ばかりに, where the cause (A) is highlighted as that minimal threshold, resulting in the often surprising effect (B).  Therefore, translations like 'even with only/just (A), (B)' are fitting, provided the surprising nature of (B) is clear.",

      "nuance": "This sentence uses a standard register suitable for casual conversation. The sentence structure is straightforward and easily understandable, suitable for conveying a simple fact without embellishment. The use of 「雨が降った」 (ame ga futta) — 'it rained' — is neutral, not showing any particular emotion."

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register fits a situation where the speaker is explaining a mishap, regretting the outcome.  The use of 「ちょっと冗談を言った」 (chotto joudan o itta) — 'I made a little joke' — is light and informal."

      "register": "Semi-formal",
      "setting": "Melancholic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a semi-formal register, as it's suitable for a slightly more formal setting or an emotional situation.  The phrase 「彼に好意を示した」 (kare ni kōi o shimeshita) — 'I showed him my affection' — can be interpreted in a more polite, nuanced way depending on context."

      "conjugation": null,

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The intimate register is used to express strong feelings. The sentence structure is relatively simple, but the impact comes from the 「あなたと出会った」 (anata to deatta) — 'I met you' — phrasing, combined with the extreme change described.  The use of \"あなた\" (anata) is a polite form of 'you', but the context is strongly intimate."

  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the \"ばかりに\" emphasizes the unexpected or disproportionate nature of the outcome. Even though the initial event might seem minor, the result is significant and often negative. This nuance is key to understanding and using this grammar point effectively.",

      "meaning": "Just, Only, Nothing but",

      "meaning": "Just because",
      "kind": "synonym",

      "term": "につき",
      "meaning": "Due to, On account of, Each or every",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that ばかり simply means 'only' or 'just,' while からといって implies dismissal, and につき is a formal cause-and-effect marker.  ばかりに, however, always conveys the sense of an unexpected or disproportionate outcome stemming from a seemingly minor cause."
