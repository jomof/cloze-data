    "writeup": "The grammar point ～んです/のです adds a nuance of **explanation or emphasis** to a statement. Think of it like saying \"the fact is...\" or \"the reason is...\" in English.  While のです is considered the grammatically correct form, んです is much more common in **spoken Japanese**. のです can sound a bit formal or stiff in casual conversation.  They are essentially interchangeable in meaning.  When asking questions, only the んです form is used, typically as ～んですか, to seek an explanation.",
