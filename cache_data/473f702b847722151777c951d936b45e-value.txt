  },
  "etymology": "だんだん (dandan) originates from the kanji 段々 (dan-dan), literally meaning \"step by step\" or \"gradually.\"  The repetition emphasizes the incremental nature of the process.",
  "writeup": "だんだん is an adverb signifying gradual, incremental change or progression.  It's used to describe a slow, steady increase or decrease. Think of it as \"little by little,\" \"step by step,\" or \"gradually.\" Unlike どんどん (dondon), which implies a rapid, noticeable change, だんだん suggests a subtle, ongoing process.  It modifies phrases rather than single words, often placed before the phrase describing the gradual change. While the particle と can be used, it's frequently omitted, a common characteristic of adverbs and onomatopoeia in Japanese.",
