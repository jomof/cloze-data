        "Register": "Very casual, slang. Primarily used in informal speech.",

        "Note": "Be mindful of context; this slang is inappropriate in formal settings."
    },
    "etymology": "This slang 「ん」 derives from two main sources. First, it replaces the 「ら」 ending of negative verb forms (e.g., 「らない」 becoming 「ん」). Second, it replaces 「ている」, the progressive form of verbs. Additionally, sentence-ending 「ん」 is a colloquial shortening of the classical auxiliary verb 「ぬ」, a strong negation.",
    "writeup": "「ん」 is a very short sound in Japanese, frequently employed in casual speech for abbreviation. Its main purpose is to streamline the flow between parts of a statement. It commonly replaces sounds requiring a \"rolling of the tongue,\" primarily the 「ら, り, る, れ, ろ」 sounds.\n\n**Common Uses:**\n\n*   **Replacing the 「ら」 Negative Stem:** This occurs in verbs where 「る」 changes to 「ら」 in the negative (e.g., 「分からない」 becomes 「分からん」). It can also apply to い-adjectives ending in 「らない」, such as 「つまらない」.\n\n*   **Replacing 「ている」:** 「ん」 can replace the entire 「いる」 in the 「ている」 progressive form (e.g., 「見ている」 becomes 「見てん」). \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Regardless of whether 「ん」 abbreviates 「らない」 or 「ている」, it's almost always followed by something else. This abbreviation avoids ending a sentence with 「ん」 to maintain flow.\n\n*   A sentence ending in 「ん」 (and not removing the negative stem) almost always abbreviates the classical auxiliary verb 「ぬ」. This usage often sounds forceful, like stating \"won't (A)\" or \"don't (A).\" For example, 「しない」 becomes 「せん」, not 「しん」, due to how 「ぬ」 conjugates with 「する」.\n\n*   「ん」 is considered slang and is very informal. It should be avoided in formal situations or when speaking with superiors.",
