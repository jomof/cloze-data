    "writeup": "The grammar point 「未だに」 (mada ni) means \"still,\" \"not yet,\" or \"even now.\" It is used to express that a situation has continued for a long time, often implying a sense of surprise or disappointment that things haven't changed. It's more formal than 「まだ」 (mada) and often emphasizes the duration of the unchanged state. 「未だに」 is typically placed at the beginning of a sentence as an adverb.",
    "etymology": "「未だに」 comes from 「未だ」 (mada), meaning \"still\" or \"not yet,\" combined with the particle 「に」 (ni), which adds emphasis and adverbial function.",
