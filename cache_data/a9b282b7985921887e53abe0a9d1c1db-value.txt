    "etymology": "The etymology of いい comes from the verb 「言う(いう)」(iu) which means \"to say\". It evolved over time to describe something that is \"well-spoken of\" or \"praiseworthy,\" eventually settling into its current meaning of \"good.\"",
    "writeup": "いい is an い-adjective that means \"good\" in Japanese. It's **important** to note that いい conjugates differently than other い-adjectives. Specifically, the first 「い」 changes to 「よ」 in many forms. For example, the negative form is 「よくない」, and the past form is 「よかった」. These forms are crucial to remember.\n\nいい is sometimes written as 「良い」, in which case it is typically read as 「よい」. While there's no technical difference in meaning between 「いい」 and 「よい」, 「よい」 can sound more formal or old-fashioned. Pay attention to context when encountering it.\n\n**Caution:** 「よく」 as an adverb (meaning \"frequently/often/well\") is not simply a conjugation of いい. It is a separate word that can be written with different kanji, such as 「良く」 or 「能く」.",
