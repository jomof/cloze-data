    "meaning": "To have the nerve to (A), To have the gall to (A), To freaking (A)",

        "Register": "Colloquial, primarily used by men.",

    "etymology": "「やがる」 is derived from the verb 「上がる(あがる)」, meaning 'to go up' or 'to rise.' In this context, it suggests that the action in question has 'risen up' to the level of irritating or angering the speaker. It's important to note the evolution of the word to express such strong negative emotion.",
    "writeup": "「やがる」 is a colloquial expression, primarily used by men, to express strong negative feelings such as scorn, disdain, or contempt towards someone's actions. It essentially means \"to have the nerve to (do something)\" or \"to have the gall to (do something),\" or even \"to freaking (do something).\" It attaches to the masu-stem of a verb.  For example, 「嘘をつきやがった」 (uso o tsuki yagatta) means \"He had the nerve to lie!\"  The phrase 「てやがる」, which is the te-form of the verb plus 「やがる」, carries the same meaning.",
