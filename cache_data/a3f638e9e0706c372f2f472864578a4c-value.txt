    "etymology": "な-adjectives are often derived from Sino-Japanese words (kango, 漢語), which are words borrowed from Chinese. The 「だ」 is a copula, indicating a state of being, similar to \"is\" in English.",
    "writeup": "The term 'predicate' refers to the part of a sentence that describes the subject. In Japanese, this is known as 述語 (jutsugo), which literally means 'statement word.' As predicates, な-Adjectives can stand alone or appear at the end of a sentence.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that all な-Adjectives can also function as nouns. Therefore, they often sound more noun-like than adjective-like when used as predicates. When only the adjective is present, it's similar to saying \"It's pretty\" or \"It's hated\" in English. The context helps determine what the 'it' refers to.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nUnlike い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives change form depending on their position in the sentence. At the end of a sentence, they are typically followed by だ or です, except in casual conversation where だ can be omitted. However, when used before the noun they modify, they are always followed by な. This characteristic gives them the name な-Adjectives.\n\nIn many sentences, either は or が can mark the word or words the predicate describes. The more natural choice depends on various factors. Generally, if you are specifically highlighting something as distinct from others in the same category, が is used. は would sound unnatural in this context.\n\nFun Fact: Many な-Adjectives originate from foreign sources, particularly Chinese or English.",
