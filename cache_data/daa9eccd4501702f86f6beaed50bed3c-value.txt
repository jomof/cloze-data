    "etymology": "The word 「とき」 originally meant \"time\" itself. Over time, it evolved to also indicate \"when\" something occurs. The kanji for 「とき」 is 時, which further reinforces its association with time.",
    "writeup": "「とき」 (時 in kanji) is a noun that means \"time.\" When used with verbs, adjectives, or nouns, it means \"when\" or \"at the time of.\" Unlike some other time expressions, 「とき」 is used for events at regular intervals (habits, hobbies) or at broad times/individual events (when it rains, when there's a sale). To connect it, use the dictionary form of verbs, い-adjectives as they are, な-adjectives + 「な」, and nouns + 「の」. 「に」 often follows 「とき」 to introduce the result of the described action.",
