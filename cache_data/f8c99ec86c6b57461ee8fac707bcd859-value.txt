  "writeup": "に即して is a formal grammar structure used to express that something is done to best handle a matter.  It combines に and the て-form of the verb 即する, meaning \"in accordance with,\" \"in line with.\"  Occasionally, に則して (\"in following with\") is used instead. This structure precedes nouns or modifies another noun directly; in the latter case, に即した is used instead of に即して.  \n\n**Important Considerations:** に即して is used when actions are based on circumstances or situations, while に則して tends to be used for actions following laws, policies, or standards. However, に即して is often used in both cases in modern Japanese. This reflects a shift towards broader application of the phrase.",
  "etymology": "The grammar point derives from the verb 即する (sokusuru), meaning 'to be in accordance with' or 'to conform to'.  The particle に marks the object or standard to which something conforms.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "会社のルールに即して、副業は禁止されている。",
      "english": "In accordance with company rules, side jobs are prohibited.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「会社」and 「ルール」, common formal vocabulary, and the passive voice  「禁止されている」, further reinforcing its formal register."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "状況に即して、対応策を検討する必要がある。",
      "english": "We need to consider countermeasures, based on the situation.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「状況」and 「対応策」in this sentence lends itself to a semi-formal tone, appropriate for professional discussion.  The choice of verb 「検討する」implies a degree of deliberation and planning."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の発言は、データに即したものでした。",
      "english": "His statement was based on the data.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "academic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formality is conveyed through the choice of words like 「発言」and the use of the past tense, 「でした」. This structure is suitable for academic contexts where precise and objective language is preferred."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "最新の研究成果に即して、治療法を改善する必要がある。",
      "english": "We need to improve the treatment method in line with the latest research findings.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "academic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses highly specialized terminology such as 「研究成果」 and 「治療法」 which makes this suitable for academic discussions. The use of 「必要がある」emphasizes the necessity."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の行動は、彼の性格に即したものだった。",
      "english": "His actions were consistent with his personality.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses more formal vocabulary such as 「行動」and 「性格」 making the context more serious and less casual. The past tense form 「だった」is used rather than the more casual 「だったよ」. This makes the speaker appear slightly more detached."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "今日の気分に即して、服を選ぼうと思う。",
      "english": "I think I'll choose my clothes based on how I feel today.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register is evident in the use of 「今日の気分」and 「服を選ぼうと思う」. The 「と思う」adds a softer, less decisive tone common in casual speech."
    },
        {
      "japanese": "君の笑顔に即して、僕の心はドキドキするよ。",
      "english": "My heart races based on your smile.",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The intimate register is clear in the use of  「君の笑顔」 and 「ドキドキするよ」. The particle 「よ」adds a playful emphasis often used in intimate speech between close friends or romantic partners.  The 「ドキドキする」is a very direct and honest way to express feelings, characteristic of  intimate conversations."

  "post_example_writeup": "Note the subtle differences in formality and register across the examples.  While に即して is inherently formal, the overall tone can be adjusted through word choice and sentence structure.",
