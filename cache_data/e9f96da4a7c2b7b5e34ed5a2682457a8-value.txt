    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に沿って」 comes from the verb 「沿う」 (sou), meaning \"to run alongside\" or \"to follow.\" The 「て」 form indicates a continuing action or state, so 「に沿って」 implies a continuous alignment or adherence to something.",
    "writeup": "「に沿って」 expresses that something is done \"along with (A),\" \"in accordance with (A),\" or \"in line with (A).\" Typically, it's used with laws, conventions, traditions, needs, and things that are not usually deviated from. The nuance is that (A) is the controlling factor, and (B) is being done with that in consideration. 「に沿って」 can also modify a noun, meaning \"along some specific path or street.\" While relatively formal, it's frequently used when literally meaning \"alongside.\"",
