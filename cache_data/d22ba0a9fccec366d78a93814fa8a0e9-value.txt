  "writeup": "からすると (karasuru to) and からすれば (karasureba) are expressions combining the particle から ('from'), the verb する ('to do'), and the hypothetical markers と and ば, respectively.  They're often translated as 'judging from (A), (B)' or 'considering (A), (B)'.  The verb する here doesn't imply action in the usual sense; rather, it indicates that (A) serves as the basis for the speaker's subsequent judgment.  You'll see からすると or からすれば following a noun, setting the stage for the speaker's assessment (B) based on that premise.  It's similar to the English expression 'going off' in this function.  The nuance emphasizes the speaker's inferential process.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of this grammar point lies in the combination of the particle から (kara, 'from'), the verb する (suru, 'to do'), and the conditional/hypothetical particles と (to) and ば (ba).  The use of する is somewhat idiomatic here, not representing a concrete action but rather a mental process of deduction or inference. The particles と and ば reflect the hypothetical nature of the judgment, indicating that the conclusion is based on the assumption of the preceding clause.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "この成績からすると、あなたは全然勉強をしていないでしょう？",
      "english": "Judging from these grades, you haven't studied at all, have you?",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "interrogative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「でしょう」 (deshou), a softer, more polite way of asking a question, appropriate for a semi-formal setting.  The speaker's age and the listener's age aren't specifically implied; the formality of the sentence is more important here."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この甘さからすると、塩と間違えて砂糖を入れてしまったに違いない。",
      "english": "Judging from how sweet this is, they must have mistakenly added sugar instead of salt.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「に違いない」 (ni chigainai) expresses strong certainty, which is quite common in casual settings.  Again, the speaker and listener's age and gender are not relevant."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "日本育ちの私からすれば、これは寿司ではない。",
      "english": "Considering I grew up in Japan, this isn't sushi.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses a relatively casual and direct tone. The personal pronoun 「私」 (watashi) is used instead of the more humble form, fitting the setting. The speaker's personal background is presented simply, typical of casual conversation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼女の反応からすると、本当に驚いているようだ。",
      "english": "Judging by her reaction, she seems genuinely surprised.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence employs 「ようだ」 (yoda), indicating a less certain inference. The use of 「彼女」 (kanojo) is common, but does not explicitly indicate any nuance in gender or age of either speaker or listener."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の言動からすれば、彼は正直な人間ではないだろう。",
      "english": "Considering his behavior, he's probably not an honest person.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「だろう」 (darou), which suggests a less assertive conclusion than 「ではない」 (de wa nai) would.  The speaker is not directly accusing the person; the conclusion is presented cautiously. No special gender or age differences are evident."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの笑顔からすると、彼女は私に気があるのかもしれない。",
      "english": "Judging from that smile, maybe she's interested in me.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「かもしれない」 (kamoshirenai), softening the directness of the statement and making it more appropriate for a flirty context.  The use of 「彼女」 (kanojo) for the female listener is common and natural in this context. The male speaker is being subtle with his advances in this sentence."

    {
      "japanese": "あなたの言葉遣いからすると、相当上品な方ですね。",
      "english": "Judging by your speech, you seem to be a very refined person.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses polite and formal language, appropriate for a first encounter. The respectful language conveys admiration without being overly familiar, suited to the date's delicate nature."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "While both からすると and からすれば express similar meanings, subtle differences exist in usage. からすると is slightly more common and generally preferred in everyday conversation. からすれば suggests a more considered and perhaps slightly more formal judgment, often based on a broader perspective or more substantial knowledge.  Context is key in choosing between the two.",

    {
      "term": "から見ると",

      "meaning": "From the point of view of",

      "meaning": "From the standpoint of",
      "kind": "synonym",

      "term": "ことから",
      "meaning": "From the fact that",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "ことから highlights the factual basis of the judgment, while からすると emphasizes the inference or deduction process itself."

      "term": "にしては",
      "meaning": "(Even) considering, (Even) for",
      "kind": "synonym",

      "meaning": "Judging from, Seeing that",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "ところを見ると (tokoro wo miru to) is more visually oriented, suggesting that the judgment is based on something directly observed, whereas からすると may also be based on indirect evidence."

      "term": "からして",
      "meaning": "Even..., Judging from, Based on",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "からして (karashite) can introduce an additional layer of emphasis or even a negative implication, whereas からすると remains relatively neutral in tone."

      "meaning": "Speaking in terms of, From the point of view of",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "から言うと (karaiuto) focuses on the speaker's perspective, while からすると focuses on the observed fact and its implication."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to distinguishing these similar expressions lies in understanding the subtle differences in their emphasis.  While they all involve making judgments based on certain factors, some focus on the viewpoint (見方 - mikata), others on the facts (事実 - jijitsu), and still others on the overall process of deduction or implication. Consider the context carefully to choose the most appropriate expression."
