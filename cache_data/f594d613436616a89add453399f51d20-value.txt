    "writeup": "The dependent noun 「由・よし」 indicates that the speaker has learned something from another source. It is used to convey information that has been heard or reported, similar to \"I heard that...\" or \"It is said that...\". This grammar point is primarily used in **formal writing and speech**, adding a level of politeness and distance. It is often seen in business correspondence, formal announcements, and news reports. 「由」 is usually followed by 「である」, 「とのこと」, or other expressions that indicate the source of the information. It is considered more formal than 「とのこと」. Unlike other grammar, there is no conjugation or modifications of 「由・よし」 itself. But the preceding verb or adjective should be in the plain form.",
    "etymology": "The kanji 「由」 originally means \"reason\" or \"cause.\" In this grammatical context, it signifies the reason or source from which information is derived. The usage evolved to denote the reporting or relaying of information from that source.",
