    "etymology": "The grammar point 「かけ」 comes from the verb 「掛(か)ける」 (kakeru), which means \"to hang,\" \"to suspend,\" or \"to start doing something.\" The nuance is that something is \"suspended\" in the process of happening, or is partially completed.",
    "writeup": "「かけ」 functions as a suffix to indicate that an action or state is unfinished, about to start, or on the verge of occurring. It's derived from the verb 「掛(か)ける」, meaning \"to hang\" or \"to start.\" Think of it as something 'suspended' in the middle of a process.  It is attached to the stem of a verb (連用形, *ren'yōkei*), and can also be used with nouns by adding 「の」.  The meaning can vary slightly depending on the verb it's attached to, ranging from 'half-done' to 'about to happen.' For example, 「食(た)べかけ」 (tabe-kake) means \"half-eaten,\" while 「死(し)にかけ」 (shini-kake) means \"on the verge of dying.\"",
