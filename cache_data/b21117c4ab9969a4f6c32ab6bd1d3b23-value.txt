    "writeup": "「そのもの」 is used to emphasize a preceding noun or adjective, indicating that something is exactly what it is described as, or the very essence of it. It can be translated as \"itself,\" \"the very,\" \"the epitome of,\" or \"utterly,\" depending on the context. It adds a strong sense of emphasis or definition. \n\nFor example, 「人生そのものが駄目になる」 means \"life *itself* will be ruined.\" 「健康そのものだ」 means someone is \"the *picture* of health.\"",
