  "writeup": "The sentence-ending particle \"わ\" initially stems from the adverbial particle \"は,\" however, they are used in quite different ways.  \"わ\" is primarily used by women to either emphasize something or to convince their listener that their statement is true. This could be translated as 'you know!', 'oh?', 'ever so (A)', or 'oh how I ever (A)' in English, where (A) is some fact they want to highlight. \"わ\" may be used after the plain form of words, meaning any verb, adjective, or auxiliary verb in their unconjugated forms. Note that both \"だ\" and \"です\" are acceptable because both are plain-form auxiliary verbs.  Usage of \"わ\" by younger women is becoming less common in recent generations. Caution: \"わ\" may also be used by men, but this use emphasizes surprise or mild exasperation, usually concerning something true but unavoidable.  This male usage remains common in some regions of Japan, particularly the west.  There's a noticeable pitch difference between the \"わ\" used in female and male speech.",
