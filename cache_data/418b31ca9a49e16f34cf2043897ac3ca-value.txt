    "etymology": "The grammar point 「じゃない」 is a contraction of 「では + ない」. 「では」 is the topic particle 「は」 attached to 「で」, the te-form of the copula 「だ」 (to be). 「ない」 is the negative form of 「ある」 (to exist). So, etymologically, 「じゃない」 indicates a state of \"not being\" something.",
    "writeup": "「じゃない」 is the casual form of 「ではない」. 「では」 is regularly contracted to 「じゃ」 in Japanese, so it's worth remembering as its own structure. 「じゃない」(casual) or 「ではない」(semi-polite) are the structures used for creating the negative form of nouns and な-adjectives. These structures are simply added to the base form of the noun or な-adjective. 「じゃ」 and 「では」 can also be used with the negative ます form of 「ある」, to create the polite variant.\n\nSometimes, 「ない」 is said/written as 「ね」 or 「ねえ」. However, this is considered very casual, or even a bit rough, so it is best avoided in most conversations.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n「じゃない」 is used very frequently to ask questions. This is similar to 「じゃないか」, a grammar point covered in another lesson. However, the nuance difference is that 「じゃない」 as a question is a little bit more blunt, like \"isn't it?\" in English. On the other hand, 「じゃないか」 is more like \"don't you think?\".\n\nWhen 「じゃない」 is used as a question, it will usually be obvious due to a rising tone.",
