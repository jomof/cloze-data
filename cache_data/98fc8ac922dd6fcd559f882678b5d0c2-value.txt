  "writeup": "ただ〜のみ is a formal expression conveying the sense of \"nothing but,\" \"only,\" or \"all that remains.\"  It combines ただ \"merely\" and the adverbial particle のみ \"only.\" While のみ shares semantic ground with だけ and ばかり, it carries a more formal register.  The element following ただ〜のみ often involves an action implying movement, continuation, or hope, suggesting that all possible actions have been exhausted, and only a hopeful outcome or continued effort remains.  When used with する-verbs, ある may sometimes replace する, shifting the emphasis from the action itself to its existence. This substitution is more common in literary contexts.",

  ],
  "etymology": "ただ〜のみ is a combination of ただ (tada), meaning \"only\" or \"merely,\" and のみ (nomi), which is also an adverbial particle meaning \"only.\"  Both words have ancient roots in the language, and their combination creates a more formal and emphatic expression than using either word alone.",
  "post_example_writeup": "Note that while the examples show diverse registers, the core meaning of ただ〜のみ remains consistent: a limitation to a single course of action or outcome.  The choice of verb and sentence structure largely determines the overall tone and nuance."
