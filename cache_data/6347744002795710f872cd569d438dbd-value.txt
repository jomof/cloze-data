  "writeup": "The particle なし (nashi), often written as 無し in kanji, is a versatile word functioning primarily as a suffix, although it's etymologically a noun meaning \"the state of not having.\"  It follows nouns to indicate their absence.  Its usage often involves the auxiliary verb だ (da) or its conjunctive form で (de).  The phrase なしで (nashi de) translates to \"without.\"  When directly modifying another noun, the particle の (no) is required, creating a phrase like A なし の B (\"B without A\").  It's not always directly attached to a noun; it can also describe the omission of something, for example, a planned activity that's skipped, often paired with the particle に (ni) to demonstrate avoidance.  **Important Consideration:**  While often interchangeable with 抜き (nuki), there's a subtle difference.  なし simply means 'without,' while 抜き, deriving from the verb 抜く (nuku, 'to remove'), implies the intentional removal of something.  This distinction isn't always significant, but understanding the underlying nuance is key.",
  "etymology": "The word な し (nashi) originates from the combination of な い (nai, 'not') and こ と (koto, 'thing').  Therefore, its root suggests a state of absence.",
