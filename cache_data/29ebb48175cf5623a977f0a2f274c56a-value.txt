    "writeup": "「て初めて」 is used to express that something happens or is realized only after a certain action or event has taken place. It's similar to saying \"not until\" or \"only after\" in English. The verb preceding 「て初めて」 is the condition that needs to be met for the subsequent event to occur. The emphasis is on the realization or new understanding gained *after* the initial action.",
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「て初めて」 is derived from the て-form of a verb followed by 「初めて」 (hajimete), which means \"for the first time.\" The て-form indicates a prior action or state, and when combined with 「初めて」, it creates the nuance that something new or significant is only experienced after that prior action.",
