  "writeup": "とも is a versatile particle functioning as a sentence-ending particle, a conjunction particle, or an adverbial particle.  Interestingly, the meanings are often interchangeable, hinging more on the word it's paired with than its grammatical role.  Common interpretations include 'even if (A)' or 'no matter if (A),' essentially emphasizing that 'despite (A), still (B).'  As a conjunction particle, とも pairs with words followed by auxiliary verbs such as う or よう, or い-adjectives in their conjunctive form.  The adverbial usage is restricted to い-adjectives in conjunctive form and a limited set of adverbs.  Unless you've encountered it used with adverbs in native material, it's best to avoid this construction.  Mastering とも will significantly enhance your ability to express nuanced conditions and concessions in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of とも is complex and relates to the evolution of various particles and conjunctions in Japanese. It ultimately derives from older forms indicating companionship or togetherness, highlighting the sense of 'even if' or 'no matter what' by implying a condition exists despite the situation.",
