    "writeup": "「のではないだろうか」 is a Japanese grammar pattern used to express an opinion indirectly, often in the form of a rhetorical question. Common translations include \"I think it's (A), isn't it?\" and \"It might be that (A).\" Literally, it can be broken down as \"is it probably not that it's (A)?\" The use of this longer, less direct phrasing adds a sense of modesty and tentativeness to the statement.\n\n「のではないだろうか」 can follow verbs and い-adjectives in their plain form. When used with な-adjectives or nouns, it requires 「な」 before 「のではないだろうか」. 「でしょう」 can often replace 「だろう」 for a more polite tone.\n\nThis phrase is often employed when seeking agreement from the listener or gently trying to persuade them to consider your perspective.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The grammar point adds a layer of politeness and indirectness.\n*   It is suitable for expressing opinions without sounding overly assertive.",
    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of several elements:\n*   「の」: Nominalizer turning a clause into a noun.\n*   「ではない」: The negative form of 「だ」 (to be).\n*   「だろう」: A conjecture or speculation.\n*   「か」: A question particle.",
