    "etymology": "The grammar point 「が必要」 is composed of the particle 「が」, which marks the subject, and the noun 「必要」(ひつよう), meaning \"necessary\" or \"essential\".",
    "writeup": "「が必要」(ga hitsuyou) is a common Japanese expression used to indicate that something is **necessary** or **needed**.  It directly follows a noun, indicating that the preceding noun is what is required. While the 「だ」 at the end can be omitted in casual speech, keeping the 「が」 helps to clearly identify the necessary item or action.",
