  "writeup": "と言える is a versatile expression built upon the potential form of the verb 言う (iu, to say).  It subtly conveys the speaker's confidence while acknowledging room for alternative perspectives.  Think of it as expressing a qualified opinion or a probable assessment.  The particle と (to) acts as a citation marker, allowing と言える to follow various phrases or statements.  It's often paired with expressions like だろう (darou) or でしょう (deshou), further softening the assertion and creating a more conversational feel.  While と言える implies a degree of certainty, the inherent potential form acknowledges a possibility of error, making it less forceful than a definitive statement.  Mastering this nuance is key to effective and natural Japanese communication.  This grammatical structure is used across genders and age groups.",
  "etymology": "The expression's core is the verb 言う (iu), meaning 'to say.'  The potential form -える (-eru) adds the nuance of possibility or ability.  The combination creates a sentence structure that means 'it can be said that...' or 'one could say that...', carrying the added implication of qualified certainty rather than absolute fact.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while と言える implies a degree of speaker confidence, its inherent flexibility allows for a range of interpretations depending on context and conjugation.

      "nuance": "Unlike と言える, which implies a somewhat confident assertion, といってもいい suggests a more tentative or less certain statement.  It's a softer, more hedging expression."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion between と言える and といってもいい, consider the level of confidence the speaker wants to convey.  と言える implies more certainty than といってもいい, which is better suited for situations where the speaker wants to be less assertive or more open to alternative viewpoints."
