  "writeup": "The conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb べし, べく attaches to the dictionary form of verbs to express the purpose of an action.  It's translated as \"for the purpose of (A), (B),\" \"in order to (A), (B),\" or \"to ensure that (A), (B).\"  Only verbs representing intentional actions, with a clear purpose, can take べく. The (B) part always indicates an intentional action taken to achieve (A). When used with する, due to べく's classical nature, it attaches to the classical stem す.  However, both すべく and するべく are acceptable in modern Japanese.  Importantly, べく is highly formal and rarely used in casual speech. \n\n**Etymology:** Although べし and its conjugations have nuanced translations, their core meaning stems from the kanji 可し, meaning \"to be permissible.\"  However, with べく, the emphasis shifts from mere permission to the determined pursuit of a goal. Thus, rather than \"in order to (A),\" べく suggests a stronger sense of \"to attain (A).\"",

    }
  ],
  "etymology": "The word べく is derived from the classical auxiliary verb べし (beshi), which has roots in the ancient kanji 可し (kashi), meaning 'to be permissible.'  While べし implies permission or appropriateness, べく adds an element of purpose and intention, emphasizing the strong goal the speaker is aiming for."
