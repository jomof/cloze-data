  "writeup": "The expression てよかった (te yokatta) conveys relief and satisfaction after a positive outcome.  It literally translates to \"doing [something] was good,\" but its nuanced meaning is closer to \"I'm glad that [something happened]\" or \"It's a good thing that [something happened].\"  This grammar point combines the て-form of a verb with the past-tense form of いい (ii – good).  The て-form indicates the action or state that preceded the feeling of relief. Note that the action implied by the て-form is usually something positive or at least something that had a positive outcome. This is because the overall feeling conveyed is that of relief and satisfaction, not simply that an action occurred. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   This phrase is versatile and used in various contexts. \n*   It's typically used in informal and standard registers, although adjustments can be made for formality, such as adding です (desu) at the end for politeness.",
  "etymology": "The expression derives from the combination of the て-form (a continuous or completed action) and the past tense of よかった (yokatta), the past tense of いい (ii – good). The て-form provides context for what happened, and よかった expresses the speaker's positive reaction to the outcome.",
