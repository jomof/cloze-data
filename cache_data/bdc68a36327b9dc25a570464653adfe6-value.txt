    "writeup": "The expression **と考えられる** is used to convey an objective opinion in Japanese. It combines the particle **と** (to mark a quote or thought) with the potential passive form of the verb **考える (かんがえる - to think)**, which is **考えられる (かんがえられる - can be thought)**. Common English translations include \"can be considered as (A),\" \"is thought to be (A),\" or \"it is conceivable that (A).\" Because it starts with **と**, this structure often appears at the end of phrases, turning them into quoted opinions.\n\nWhen expressing a **subjective** opinion, **と思われる (とおもわれる - to seem, to think subjectively)** is used instead.  An **objective** opinion is based on observable facts (unbiased, focusing on the object), while a **subjective** opinion relies more on feelings or preferences (potentially biased). \n\n**Important Consideration:**  Compared to **考えられている (かんがえられている - is being thought, is considered)**, **考えられる** emphasizes judgment or possibility. **考えられている** is primarily used to describe widely accepted opinions or common knowledge.",
