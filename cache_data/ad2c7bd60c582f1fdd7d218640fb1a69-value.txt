  "writeup": "ことか is a fascinating grammatical particle combining こと 'thing' and the interrogative particle か.  It's used to express astonishment or disbelief at the extent or degree of something.  While often translated as 'How...', 'What...', or even the more emphatic 'God knows...', its core function is to highlight the unexpected magnitude of a situation.  The sentence structure often features an adverbial phrase emphasizing the degree (e.g., どれだけ 'how much,' いくら 'how much/many'), followed by ことか. This construction conveys a rhetorical question, emphasizing the speaker's surprise or incredulity rather than seeking a direct answer.  In modern Japanese, ことか tends to be more common in written contexts, adding a touch of poetic or dramatic flair.  Overuse in casual speech might sound unnatural, unless employed for deliberate dramatic effect.",
  "etymology": "The etymology is straightforward: こと is a noun meaning 'thing' or 'matter,' and か is a particle that turns a statement into a question or expresses emphasis.  The combination emphasizes the 'whatness' of a situation to a surprising or unbelievable degree. The emphasis provided by か enhances the emotional weight of the expression.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the appropriate choice of adverb before ことか is crucial to effectively conveying the nuance of surprise and emphasis. The more expressive adverbs will add more emotional weight. This is not a frequently used grammar point, but knowing this structure will let you appreciate its emotional resonance when you encounter it in literature or dramatic speech.",

      "meaning": "(What) the heck?, (Who) in the world?, (Where) on earth?, (How many) f*ing...",

      "nuance": "While 一体 can also express disbelief, it is far more versatile, used in general questions of identity, place, quantity etc.  ことか is more specific to expressing surprise at the degree or extent of something."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that ことか focuses on the degree or extent of a surprisingly large situation, while ものか expresses a strong negation or doubt. 一体 is a much broader term used for expressing general disbelief, whereas ことか is used more rhetorically and emphasizes a situation's scale."
