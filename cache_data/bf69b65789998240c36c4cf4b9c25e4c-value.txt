    "writeup": "「っけ」 is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese used when the speaker is trying to remember or confirm information they've forgotten. It's similar to adding \"again?\" to a question in English.  Traditionally, 「っけ」 follows the past form of the auxiliary verbs 「だ」 or 「た」, meaning you'd typically see 「だったっけ」 or 「たっけ」. It's also common to see 「のだ」 and 「んだ」 used before 「っけ」 to express things like explanation or emphasis in the past.  \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   While grammatical rules suggest using 「んだっけ」 or 「だったっけ」, younger generations often omit 「んだ」, especially with verbs. Be aware that while this is common in casual conversation, it's not considered grammatically correct in formal writing or speaking.\n*   「っけ」 is versatile. You can use it when asking yourself a rhetorical question or when directly asking someone else something you've forgotten.",
