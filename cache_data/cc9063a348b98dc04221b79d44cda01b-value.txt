    "etymology": "The particle 「から」originally signified 'from' or 'starting point'. Over time, it evolved to also indicate the origin or cause of something, hence its use to express 'because'. The sense of 'from' underlies both meanings; in the case of 'because,' the consequence stems 'from' the reason.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「から」 indicates a reason or cause. Think of it as 'because' or 'since'. The basic structure is: (Reason) + 「から」+ (Result). When attaching 「から」 to nouns or な-adjectives, you typically use 「だ」 before it (e.g., 「明日あしたは日曜日だから」). However, in more casual speech, 「だ」 can be omitted. The order of clauses is generally fixed: the reason always comes before the result. 「から」is a versatile particle that's fundamental for explaining why something is the way it is.",
