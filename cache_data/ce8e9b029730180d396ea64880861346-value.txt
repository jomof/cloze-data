        "Register": "Varies depending on the politeness level used.",
        "Who receives": "The speaker or someone closely associated with the speaker.",

    "etymology": "The verb くれる originally meant \"to give.\" Over time, it became specialized to indicate giving specifically to the speaker or someone in the speaker's in-group. 呉れる is the kanji form; however, it's more commonly written in hiragana as くれる.",
    "writeup": "**くれる** (or 呉れる, though the kanji form is less common) means \"to give\" something to **me** or someone closely associated with me (like my family member or close friend). This is a core verb for expressing giving and receiving, and careful usage is essential to avoid sounding awkward. The verb inherently implies that the speaker or someone close to the speaker is the recipient of the action. It is used only when the giver is not of higher status than the receiver. If the giver is of higher status, then くださる should be used instead. **Important:** When giving something to someone else, use あげる instead of くれる.",
