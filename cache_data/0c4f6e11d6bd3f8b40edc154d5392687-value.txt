  "writeup": "The particle まで, pronounced \"made,\" indicates a limit or extent.  When attached to a verb, it signifies 'until (the point when) something happens.'  It's crucial to understand that while English often uses past tense in such constructions (\"until I finished\"), Japanese uses the non-past form of the verb with まで. The past tense is usually inferred from context or subsequent verbs. For example,  \"授業が始まるまで、雨が降っていた\" (Jugyō ga hajimaru made, ame ga futte ita) -  \"It was raining until class started.\"  Here, the past tense is implied by the context and the past-tense verb \"降っていた\" (futte ita).  This is a key difference from English usage, so pay close attention to the overall sentence structure to grasp the timing.  Let's examine the nuances through example sentences.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of まで is complex, tracing back to Old Japanese.  It is related to other particles expressing limits or boundaries, reflecting the historical development of expressing spatial and temporal extent.",
