    "etymology": "This grammar point is a combination of the conditional forms 「たら」or 「ば」 or 「なら」with the particle 「で」. The repetition emphasizes the idea that regardless of the condition, a certain outcome or situation will still occur.",
    "writeup": "The 「たら〜で」 construction involves repeating a word or phrase, and it can be used in both positive and negative contexts. It conveys the meaning of \"if (A), then even with (A), (B).\" A common translation is \"even if (A), (B)\".\n\n*   Verbs and *i*-adjectives are paired with 「たら」 or 「ば」. \n*   *Na*-adjectives use 「なら」.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nThe nuance changes based on the first part of the sentence:\n\n*   In a good situation (A), a problem (B) will arise.\n*   In a problematic situation (A), (B) can still be done.\n\nIn either case, (B) contradicts (A).\n\nNote that 「なら〜で」 only follows *na*-adjectives in this meaning. If you see 「なら〜で」 following another word type, it expresses dissatisfaction or tells people what to do.",
