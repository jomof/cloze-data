    "etymology": "The non-past form of the verb is its base or dictionary form. It's the form you'll find in dictionaries and is the foundation for other conjugations. Historically, this form covered both present and future tenses, and Japanese grammar retains this dual functionality.",
    "writeup": "The non-past form of verbs in Japanese is identical to the dictionary form. This single form covers multiple English verb tenses and nuances. It can express general facts, habits, and future events. Because of this broad usage, context and time expressions are **important** for clarity. Without specific time indicators, the non-past form typically indicates a general truth. In literature, you might see the non-past used for actions happening 'in the moment,' relying on context for understanding.",
