  "writeup": "The grammar points \"でできる\" and \"からできる\" both express the idea of something being made from or out of something else.  They highlight the materials or ingredients used. While often translated similarly into English, subtle differences exist.  \"からできる\" literally means \"made from,\" often used when the materials are less obvious or when emphasizing the original state before transformation.  \"でできる\" means \"made with,\" often used when the materials are more visible.  However, modern usage often blurs this distinction, with \"でできる\" being more prevalent, even when the origin material isn't readily apparent.  This applies across genders and ages.  Importantly, there's a distinction between \"できる\" (can be done/made) and \"できている\" (is completed/made).  \"できる\" implies a general capability, while \"できている\" focuses on a specific instance.  Even this distinction is often softened in casual conversation, mirroring the interchangeable nature of \"で\" and \"から\".",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while the nuance between \"で\" and \"から\" is subtle and often disregarded, understanding the original distinction helps appreciate the slight shift in emphasis. Likewise, the difference between the general \"できる\" and the specific \"できている\" is vital to communicate your intended meaning precisely.  Mastering these nuances will elevate your Japanese communication significantly.",
  "etymology": "The verb \"できる\" (dekiru) is formed from the verb \"できる\" (dekiru) meaning 'to be able to do' and the particle \"で\" and \"から\" which both function here as source markers, indicating the origin or material from which something is made. These particles originally highlighted the starting materials in the production process.",
