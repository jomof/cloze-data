  "writeup": "る-verbs, also known as Ichidan verbs (一段), are a fascinating category in Japanese.  They're called 'one-level' verbs because they only have one stem, unlike Godan verbs (五段) which have multiple stems.  This single stem is the dictionary form, ending in る.  To form the polite masu-form (ます形), simply replace the る with ます.  The plain, or short, form is commonly used in casual settings while the ます form is polite.  This seemingly simple structure belies a deeper elegance. \n\n**Important Considerations:** While all る-verbs end in る, the converse isn't true.  Many verbs ending in る are actually Godan verbs and conjugate differently.  Careful observation of conjugation is crucial for correct identification.\n\nLet's explore the beauty of their conjugation through examples.",
  "etymology": "The term \"Ichidan\" (一段) literally means \"one level\", reflecting the single stem used in conjugating these verbs.  The \"ru\" ending is a phonetic evolution of older verb forms, a testament to the language's historical development.",
