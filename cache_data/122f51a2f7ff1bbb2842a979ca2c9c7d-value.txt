    "etymology": "The word 「せい」 is derived from 「所為」 (shoi), which literally means \"doings\" or \"actions.\" It implies that a negative outcome is a result of someone's or something's actions.",
    "writeup": "「せい」 is a noun, often written in hiragana though it originates from the kanji form 「所為」, meaning \"doings.\" It expresses that a negative result occurred due to a particular cause, action, or person. Thus, it conveys blame, fault, or cause. It's similar to saying \"it's the doing of...\" in English. Because it is a noun, 「せい」 follows nouns with the particle 「の」 and verbs/adjectives in their short form. The particle 「で」 is often added after 「せい」, particularly when indicating the result that occurred because of those \"doings\".",
