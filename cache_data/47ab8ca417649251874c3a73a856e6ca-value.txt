    "etymology": "The particle な is believed to have originated from the negative auxiliary verb ず (zu) in classical Japanese. Over time, ず evolved into ぬ (nu) and then to な (na) in certain contexts, particularly to express prohibition.",
    "writeup": "な is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese used to express a strong prohibition. It's attached directly to the dictionary form of a verb, conveying the meaning of \"Don't do...\" or \"Do not do...\". It carries a forceful nuance, often used in situations where the speaker wants to firmly prevent someone from doing something. Because of its directness, it's generally used in informal speech, often by males, and can sound harsh if not used carefully. Adding 「よ」 can soften the tone.",

Understanding these nuances is essential for appropriate communication."
