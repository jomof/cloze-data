    "etymology": "The grammar point derives from the verb 至る (itaru), meaning \"to arrive,\" \"to reach,\" or \"to lead to.\" The に particle indicates the point or situation that is reached, emphasizing that a certain outcome or realization occurs only upon reaching that specific stage.",
    "writeup": "Similar to other grammar points involving the verb 至る (itaru), meaning \"to arrive,\" \"to reach,\" or \"to lead to,\" に至って indicates that event A is an extreme that results in event B. The particle に marks the noun or verb that 至る signifies as being the extreme. Common translations include \"only when (A), did (B) occur\" and \"going as far as to (A), (B).\" \n\nThe extreme nature of に至って often implies that something has been left unattended for too long. Therefore, this grammar point is frequently used in the context of criticizing a lack of action.\n\nLike many other verb-based grammar structures, the formal conjunctive form 至り may occasionally replace the standard て-form 至って.\n\n**Important Caution**: に至って and に至っても have different meanings. Pay attention to these key differences:\n\n*   **(A)に至って(B)**: Only when reaching the extreme of (A) did (B) occur.\n*   **(A)に至っても(B)**: Even if reaching the extreme of (A), (B) won't occur. (This is covered in a separate grammar point.)",
