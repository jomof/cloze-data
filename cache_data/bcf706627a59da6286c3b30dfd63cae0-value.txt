  "writeup": "ても差し支えない ('temo sashitsukaenai') is a polite expression used to ask for or grant permission, similar to てもいい ('te mo ii').  It literally translates to 'it's not a hindrance if...', combining ても (or でも for nouns/na-adjectives) with the negative form of the verb 差し支える ('sashitsukaeru'), meaning 'to interfere' or 'to hinder'.  The polite form, 差し支えありません ('sashitsukae arimasen'), is almost always preferred over the plain form.  When asking permission, か ('ka') is added.  While polite, 差し支える itself is used outside polite contexts to indicate a negative impact. This grammar point is typically used in formal settings and is quite common among adults in professional contexts.",
  "etymology": "The phrase is built upon 差し支える (sashitsukaeru), a compound verb.  差し (sashi) means 'to offer,' 'to present,' or 'to extend,' while 支える (saeru) means 'to support' or 'to hold up.'  The combined meaning hints at something that would otherwise support or aid but instead would now cause an obstacle or hinderance.  The negative form, therefore, means 'does not hinder' or 'does not interfere with.' The 'te mo' form adds a sense of flexibility or allowance.",
