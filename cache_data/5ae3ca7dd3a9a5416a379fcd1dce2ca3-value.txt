    "etymology": "The grammar point is composed of 「て」form of the verb, the particle 「も」indicating 'even', and 「いい」 meaning 'good' or 'okay'. Therefore, literally, it conveys the idea of 'even if [verb] is done, it's good/okay.'",
    "writeup": "「Verb[て] + **もいい**」 expresses permission, allowance, or concession. It indicates that something is permissible or acceptable, or that it's okay even if a certain condition is met. It's commonly used to ask for or give permission, or to express that something is not a problem even if a certain situation exists.\n\n*   You can use it to ask for permission: 「ここで煙草を吸ってもいいですか。」 \"May I smoke here?\"\n*   You can use it to give permission: 「はい、いいです。」 \"Yes, you may.\"\n*   It can also express concession: 「高くてもいい。」 \"It is okay even if it's expensive.\"\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   The negative form 「てはいけない」 means \"must not\" or \"is not allowed.\"",
