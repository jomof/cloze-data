  "etymology": "抜きで is a compound structure.  抜き (nuki) comes from the verb 抜く (nuku), meaning \"to extract,\" \"to remove,\" or \"to omit.\"  The particle で (de) indicates the means or manner.  Therefore, 抜きで literally signifies \"by means of extraction/removal/omission.\" This meaning evolves into the sense of \"without\" or \"unless,\" as it emphasizes the absence of something.",
  "writeup": "The Japanese grammatical construction 抜きで (nukide) literally translates to \"without (something)\" or \"unless (something).\"  It's formed by combining the noun form of the verb 抜く (nuku, to extract, remove, omit) with the particle で (de, indicating manner or means).  Think of it as expressing something being done with the absence of a particular element.  This is particularly useful when discussing what is left out of something. It's important to note that 抜きで functions as a suffix, always appearing after the noun denoting the element being excluded.  For instance, if you are talking about making sushi without wasabi, you say \"ワサビ抜きで (wasabi nukide).\"  While generally standard register, you will see it in informal settings frequently.",

      "japanese": "冗談**抜きで**、彼は本当に怖い人だ。",
      "english": "Without joking, he's a really scary person.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「冗談抜きで」 (jōdan nukide) makes the statement more emphatic and trustworthy. It suggests that what follows is not to be taken lightly. The sentence is casual due to the use of だ (da) and the nature of the statement itself."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼**抜きで**、このプロジェクトは成功しないだろう。",
      "english": "Without him, this project won't succeed.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「だろう」 (darou), which softens the assertion, while 「彼抜きで」(kare nukide) is essential in the context, making it more nuanced.  The register is semi-formal because of the use of the conditional tense."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ワサビ**抜きで**寿司を食べるなんて、ありえない！",
      "english": "Eating sushi without wasabi is unthinkable!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The exclamation mark and the use of 「なんて」 (nante), a casual expression, along with 「ありえない」(ari enai) indicating incredulity, give it a casual tone. 「ワサビ抜きで」(wasabi nukide) is clear and direct."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼**抜きでは**、パーティーはつまらないだろう。",
      "english": "Without him, the party will be boring.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「だろう」(darou) makes this prediction softer than a definitive statement.  The use of  「彼抜きでは」(kare nukidewa) is slightly more formal than 「彼抜きで」(kare nukide)."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "君**抜きでは**、私は生きていけない。",
      "english": "Without you, I can't live.",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「君」(kimi), a term of address usually reserved for close friends or romantic partners,  combined with 「生きていけない」(ikite ikenai) conveys deep emotional dependence.  The sentence is directly speaking to the listener, increasing intimacy. The speaker being male adds to the flirtatious nature.  The 「では」 instead of 「で」 adds a subtle level of formality, making the statement more heartfelt rather than blunt."

      "english": "I'd like a cup of coffee without sugar.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite form 「ください」(kudasai) and the directness of the request maintain a professional tone.  The clarity of 「砂糖抜きで」(satō nukide) is perfectly suitable for a polite order."

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while 抜きで is versatile, its core meaning always revolves around the absence or omission of something.  The nuances are expressed through the surrounding words and sentence structure, not the grammar point itself.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "なし",
      "meaning": "Without, No",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike 抜きで, which implies the deliberate removal or omission of something, なし (nashi) is a more general term for absence or lack of something.  It's less focused on the active removal and is simpler to use."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To choose between 抜きで and なし, consider the context.  If you're emphasizing the deliberate removal or exclusion of a specific item, 抜きで is more appropriate. If you simply want to state the absence of something, なし is sufficient.  The subtle difference helps convey the intended nuance."
