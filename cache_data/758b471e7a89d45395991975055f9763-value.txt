    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずにはおかない」 is derived from a combination of elements: 「ず」, a classical auxiliary verb indicating negation; 「に」, a case-marking particle; 「は」, an adverbial particle; and 「措く(おく)」, a verb meaning \"to set aside\" or \"leave as is,\" in its negated form 「おかない」. The literal sense is \"cannot leave it as is without doing (something),\" conveying a strong sense of obligation or inevitability.",
    "writeup": "「ずにはおかない」 is a formal expression indicating a strong determination or inevitability. It means \"will definitely,\" \"will certainly,\" \"bound to,\" or \"not fail to.\" It combines the classical auxiliary verb 「ず」 (ない), the particle 「に」, the particle 「は」, and the negated form of the verb 「措く(おく)」, 「おかない」. \n\n*   This grammar point expresses a strong resolve to complete an action, implying that one cannot simply 'leave things as they are.' It is similar in meaning to 「ないではおかない」. Due to the expression's strong connotation of determination, it often appears with causative verbs, signaling a commitment to ensuring someone else performs the action.\n\n*   **Important Considerations:** This expression conveys a sense of strong will and determination. It's often used in formal writing and speech, and should be used carefully to avoid sounding overly assertive or aggressive. It's suitable for expressing personal resolve, predicting inevitable outcomes, or emphasizing the impact of something on others.",
