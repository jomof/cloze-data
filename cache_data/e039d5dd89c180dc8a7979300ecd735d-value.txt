  "writeup": "でしょう, often contracted to でしょ in casual speech, is a polite auxiliary verb expressing a tentative assertion or seeking confirmation.  It's frequently translated as \"right?\", \"probably,\" or \"isn't it?\"  It implies the speaker believes something is true and expects the listener to agree.  While it might sound hesitant, it actually indicates a degree of certainty based on the speaker's knowledge or assumptions.  Crucially, でしょう typically follows the plain form of verbs and adjectives, not the ～ます form.  However, older literature or very formal settings might show ～ますでしょう, though this is rare in modern conversation.  Important Consideration:  Although sounding somewhat uncertain, using でしょう conveys that the speaker possesses information suggesting the assertion's validity.",
  "etymology": "でしょう is a polite form derived from です, the polite form of だ (to be).  The addition of しょ likely stems from a contraction of the emphatic particle だろう. This evolution reflects the subtle shift from a simple assertion to a more nuanced expression of likely truth with an expectation of agreement.",
