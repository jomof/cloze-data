    "writeup": "The conjunction particle たら is used to indicate a temporal or conditional relationship between two events. It often carries a nuance that the second event (B) is a natural consequence or follows directly after the completion of the first event (A).  It can express:\n\n*   **A sequence of events:**  Once A happens, B happens.\n*   **A condition:** If A happens, then B will happen.\n\nTo form the たら form, attach たら to the past tense form of verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns + です.  For example:\n\n*   Verb (past): 食べ**た** \u3000→\u3000 食べ**たら**\n*   い-Adjective (past): 寒**かった** \u3000→\u3000 寒**かったら**\n*   な-Adjective (past):  暇**だった** \u3000→\u3000 暇**だったら**\n*   Noun + です (past): 明日**だった** \u3000→\u3000 明日**だったら**\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   While たら often translates to \"if,\" it inherently carries a stronger sense of **temporal sequence** and **completion** compared to other conditional forms like ば.  Think of it as \"once [the condition is met]\" or \"when [this happens].\"\n*   The たら form itself **does not inherently indicate past tense**. The tense of the overall sentence is determined by the verb in the main clause (the part after たら).\n*   たら is commonly used for both **hypothetical situations** and **past events**. The context clarifies whether you are talking about something that might happen or something that has already happened.",
