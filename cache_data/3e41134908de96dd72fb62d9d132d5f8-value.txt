  "writeup": "This grammar point, べくもない (beku mo nai), expresses the impossibility or unlikelihood of an action or state.  It's formed by combining the classical auxiliary verb stem べく (beku, from the verb べし - beshi, 'should') with も (mo, 'even,' emphasizing negation) and ない (nai, the negative form of the adjective 'to be').  The resulting phrase strongly emphasizes the speaker's conviction that the situation described is impossible.  It's frequently used with verbs expressing thoughts or feelings, highlighting the speaker's disbelief or lack of hope. This structure carries a fairly formal tone and isn't typically used in casual conversations.  It's more common in written Japanese, particularly in literary works, formal speeches, or news reports.  The inherent formality stems from its etymological roots in classical Japanese.  Mastering べくもない adds significant depth to your ability to express strong negation and unwavering certainty in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The core of べくもない lies in the classical auxiliary verb べし (beshi), meaning 'should' or 'ought to'.  Over time, べく (beku), the stem of べし, has evolved into a more nuanced element indicating expectation or likelihood.  When coupled with もない (mo nai), the emphatic negation, it transforms into the strong assertion of impossibility conveyed by べくもない.",
