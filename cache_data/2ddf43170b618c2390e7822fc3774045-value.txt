  "writeup": "そうもない (sō mo nai) is a versatile Japanese expression used with verbs to indicate a low probability or the seeming impossibility of an action.  It's formed by combining the auxiliary verb そう (sō, 'it seems'), the adverbial particle も (mo, 'even,' 'also,' emphasizing the unlikelihood), and the negative い-adjective ない (nai, 'not').  Therefore, そうもない literally translates to something like 'it doesn't even seem like (it will happen)'.  It follows the verb in its conjunctive (or -te/-de) form.  **Important Consideration:** そうもない is stronger than そうにない (sō ni nai), implying a more emphatic negation of likelihood.  Think of it as 'not even seeming possible' versus 'not seeming likely'.  The nuance is subtle but significant.  This structure works particularly well with potential verbs (verbs showing ability or possibility), where it conveys that even the possibility appears remote. While often translated as 'doesn't seem like it can be done', it carries a stronger implication, akin to 'has no chance of happening'.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of そうもない is straightforward. そう derives from the verb そうである (to seem, to appear).  The particle も adds emphasis, and ない negates the preceding expression. This simple combination creates a nuanced expression conveying a strong sense of unlikelihood.",
