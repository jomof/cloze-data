    "writeup": "The suffix 「上 (じょう)」, when attached to a noun, indicates that something is being viewed or discussed **from the standpoint of** that noun.  Think of it as establishing a specific field, area, or category from which to consider a matter. The part of the sentence following the 「A上」 structure will detail what's being considered within that perspective.  This grammar point carries a fairly **formal** tone and is often used in situations where objective viewpoints or established frameworks are being referenced.  It's similar to 「に関して (にかんして - in connection to)」, but more specifically highlights the 'standpoint' aspect. You'll frequently encounter 「上」 used with broad concepts like 「仕事 (しごと - work)」, 「教育 (きょういく - education)」, 「歴史 (れきし - history)」, 「健康 (けんこう - health)」, 「経験 (けいけん - experience)」, or 「法律 (ほうりつ - the law)」. **Important Consideration:** 「上」 cannot be used to express the personal viewpoint of an individual. Therefore, it's incorrect to attach it directly to personal names or organization names.",

            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "The use of 「法律上」 clearly sets the legal framework as the viewpoint for this statement. The formal register is appropriate for discussing legal matters."

            "nuance": "The speaker uses 「予算上」 to playfully introduce the idea of going slightly over budget, creating a lighthearted and suggestive tone. The question 「しない？」 adds a casual, almost pleading nuance, typical in flirtatious situations.",
            "etymology": "Using 「予算 (よさん - budget)」 highlights a constraint, which is then juxtaposed with the suggestion to indulge."

            "register": "semi-formal",
            "setting": "cautious",
            "nuance": "「計算上」 limits the discussion to a theoretical, calculated perspective, contrasting it with the complexities of reality. This cautious tone is often used when discussing predictions or plans."

    "post_example_writeup": "Note that while 「上」 can indicate a viewpoint, it's crucial to remember it refers to the standpoint of a **concept, rule, or field**, not a person or organization. The example 「鈴木上、会社Aが会社Bに買収される事はいい事だと思っている。」 is grammatically incorrect because it uses a person's name before 「上」. To express Suzuki's opinion, you would need to use a different construction, such as 「鈴木さんの立場からすると」 or 「鈴木さんとしては」.",
