  "writeup": "かねる, a る-verb meaning 'to spread across' (usually 2 different activities or thought processes), often follows the ます-stem of other verbs to highlight that '(A) is not possible'.  However, かねる often indicates that the speaker would actually *like* to do (A), but cannot due to some external circumstances such as difficulty, already being busy, being hesitant, etc. This grammar pattern is most frequently seen in its non-kanji form, although both are possible. かねる is somewhat formal and may be used in cases where a phrase like できない would be considered too strong; the speaker wants to lightly imply that (A) cannot be done.  Fun fact: As かねる means 'to spread across', this expression can be thought of as similar to 'to be a stretch' in English. It simply indicates that doing (A) would be a stretch of the speaker's ability or capacity.",
  "etymology": "The verb かねる comes from the verb 兼ねる (かねる), which originally meant \"to combine\" or \"to do two things at once.\"  The current usage of かねる to express inability is a semantic shift, stemming from the idea that doing two things at once is difficult or impossible. The inability is often self-imposed due to limitations of skill or time, rather than strict impossibility.",

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「あのね」and 「んだけど…」are characteristic of intimate speech, especially between a male and a female. The 「しかねる」expresses the speaker's hesitation to confess, creating a sense of vulnerability that makes the confession even more romantic."

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the core meaning. かねる implies difficulty or hesitation, often due to limitations of time or ability.  The other expressions focus on different aspects of inability, such as impossibility due to circumstance (わけにはいかない), inherent inability (〜得ない), or the inability to complete a task (切れない).  を兼ねて is a completely different grammatical structure, used to express doing multiple actions at once."
