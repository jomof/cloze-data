    "etymology": "「だった」 and 「でした」 are the past tense forms of 「だ」 and 「です」, respectively. 「だ」 is a copula (linking verb) indicating existence or identity, and 「です」 is its polite form. Both are derived from the auxiliary verb 「た」, which signifies past tense or completion.",
    "writeup": "To express that something \"was\" a certain way in Japanese, use 「だった」 (casual) or 「でした」 (polite) after a noun or な-adjective. These are combinations of the auxiliary verbs 「だ」 (or 「です」 in polite speech) and 「た」 (past tense). For 「だった」, add 「った」 to the base form of 「だ」. For 「です」, 「す」 changes to 「し」 before adding 「た」, becoming 「でした」.\n\n**Important:** い-adjectives have their own conjugation rules for the past tense, and cannot be used with 「だった」 or 「でした」.",
