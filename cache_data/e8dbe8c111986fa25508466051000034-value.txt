    "writeup": "The adverb **却って (kaette)** expresses a result that is contrary to what was expected or intended. It conveys the nuance of \"instead,\" but not in the sense of choosing one thing over another. Instead, it signifies that the actual outcome was the opposite of the initial aim or anticipation.  Think of it as 'taking a step back' from the initial idea to show the real, often undesirable, result.\n\nThe structure is often **(Intention/Action) + 却って + (Unexpected/Opposite Result)**.  The kanji 却 (kyaku/shirizo-ku) itself means \"to retreat\" or \"to reject,\" which reinforces the idea of stepping back from the initial expectation.",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "friendly",
            "nuance": "The speaker is using 「けど」 which softens the request and 「ごめんね」 for politeness, typical in casual conversation. The sentence structure clearly shows the initial appreciation contrasted with the actual outcome."

            "nuance": "The 「〜つもりだったけど」 construction indicates the speaker's original intention, contrasted with the unexpected negative outcome using 「却って」. 「〜てしまった」 conveys regret."

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "humorous",
            "nuance": "The use of 「〜って」 for quoting direct speech and 「〜たくなくなる」 to express a decreased desire are common in casual speech. The sentence illustrates the paradoxical effect of being told to do something."

            "nuance": "The 「〜かもしれないけど」 construction acknowledges a potential assumption before presenting the contrasting reality with 「却って」.  「〜ないで」 is a polite way of saying \"don't\"."

            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "serious",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ところが」、「逆に」、「に反して」、and 「むしろ」 can all introduce contrasting information, it's important to remember the specific nuance of 「却って」. It focuses on situations where an action or intention leads to a result that is the opposite of what was hoped for, often with a negative connotation. Think of 「却って」 when the intended solution or action makes things worse or has an undesirable opposite effect."
