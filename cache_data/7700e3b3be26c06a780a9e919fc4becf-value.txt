    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことだし」 is derived from 「こと」 (thing, matter), 「だ」 (the copula), and 「し」 (a conjunctive particle indicating reason among others). Thus, it literally means 'it is the case that,' but is used to imply that the stated reason is just one of multiple reasons.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ことだし」 combines the noun 「こと」 ('thing'), the auxiliary verb 「だ」, and the conjunctive particle 「し」, used for listing reasons. It translates as \"because (A)\" or \"since (A),\" emphasizing that there are other reasons in addition to the one specified. This structure follows a word in its attributive form or a noun followed by 「の」. Similar to using 「し」 in creating lists, it indicates that (A) is not the sole reason. It suggests that 'while there are other reasons, (A) is sufficient to (B).' (B) is often a suggestion, invitation, or expression of determination.",
