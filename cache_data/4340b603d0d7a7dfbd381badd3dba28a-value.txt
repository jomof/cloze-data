  "writeup": "来る (kuru) is an irregular verb meaning \"to come.\" Unlike most Japanese verbs, it doesn't follow the standard Godan or Ichidan conjugation patterns.  Its irregularity stems from the fact that the final る is dropped in conjugations, leaving the く stem which then undergoes modifications depending on the grammatical context. This makes it unique, exhibiting characteristics of both る-verbs and う-verbs.  The particle に or へ always accompanies くる to indicate the destination. 来ている (kiteiru) signifies being at a place one has come to, emphasizing the state of being present rather than simply the act of coming. Note that 来ている is usually used for temporary locations;  it wouldn't be used for 'being at home'.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of くる is complex and not fully understood, tracing back to ancient Proto-Japonic roots, related to concepts of arrival and approach. The irregularity in its conjugation reflects its ancient origins and its resilience in the modern language.",
