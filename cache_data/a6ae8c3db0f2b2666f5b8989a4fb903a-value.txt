  "writeup": "The phrase \"ならともかく\" (nara tomokaku) is a nuanced expression used to compare two scenarios and highlight a contrast.  It literally translates to \"if it were (A), then it'd be different, but since it's (B), it is what it is.\"  The first clause, often introduced by a noun phrase followed by \"なら\" (nara), sets up a hypothetical situation.  The second clause, following \"ともかく\" (tomo kaku), presents the actual reality.  It emphasizes that while something might be acceptable or true under certain conditions, it's not applicable in the current circumstances.  The overall effect is to downplay the first scenario while highlighting the importance of the second.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   \"ならともかく\" is typically used after nouns, although the grammatical structure can accept clauses with verbs/adjectives.\n*   The nuance lies in the implicit contrast and the speaker's often dismissive attitude towards the first hypothetical. This creates a subtly critical or condescending tone that can be hard to directly capture in English.\n*   This is not an overly formal construction; rather, it has a more natural, semi-formal feel.\n*   The structure suggests a somewhat dismissive attitude towards the initial condition, implying a certain level of casualness.",
