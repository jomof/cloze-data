    "etymology": "The word 「また」 originally comes from 「亦」, an old kanji that means 'also' or 'again.' Over time, the hiragana form became more common in everyday usage.",
    "writeup": "「また」 is used to indicate repetition or addition, similar to \"again,\" \"also,\" \"moreover,\" or \"in addition\" in English. It can function as both an adverb and a conjunction. As a conjunction, 「また」 connects sentences or phrases, adding information or indicating a repeated action or state. 「また」 can start a sentence, as long as the sentence expresses a complete thought.\n\n*   **Repetition**: Indicates that something is happening again.\n*   **Addition**: Introduces additional information or a related point.",
