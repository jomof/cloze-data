  "writeup": "The verb 込む (komu), meaning \"to go into\" or \"to put into,\" is a versatile suffix often attached to the stem of other verbs.  It doesn't simply add the idea of 'entering'—it implies a forceful or complete immersion. Think of something jamming or wedging into a space.  We'll focus on its core meaning in this lesson, using it as a suffix that modifies the verb to which it is attached.  The resulting meaning often translates cleanly to English as 'to put into' or 'to go into,' but understanding the nuance of 'jamming' is crucial for accurate interpretation and natural expression.  Mastering this verb will greatly enhance your ability to describe actions involving full engagement, intensity, or complete entry into a situation.  Let's explore its usage through several examples.",
  "etymology": "The verb 込む (komu) is believed to derive from the older verb 込む (komu), meaning \"to insert\" or \"to thrust.\" This ancient root explains the sense of forceful entry often conveyed by the modern form.",

Consider the overall implication of the verb to determine which meaning best applies."
