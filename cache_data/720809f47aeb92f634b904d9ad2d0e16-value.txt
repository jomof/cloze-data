    "meaning": "to do something (knowing that it will cause someone trouble)",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Varies depending on the specific verb and context.",
        "Function": "Indicates that the speaker is performing an action that they know will cause trouble, difficulty, or inconvenience for the recipient. Often implies a sense of spite, condescension, or deliberate imposition."

    },
    "formation": {
        "[Verb in Te-form] + やる": "Indicates doing something to someone knowing it will cause trouble."
    },
    "etymology": "The auxiliary verb 「やる」 here is derived from the verb 「やる」 meaning \"to do\" or \"to give (to someone of lower status).\" In this usage, it retains the sense of \"doing\" something, but with the added nuance of intentionally causing trouble for the recipient. The \"giving\" aspect is twisted to imply giving someone a hard time.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「～てやる」 indicates that the speaker does something to someone, knowing it will cause trouble, difficulty, or inconvenience. This often implies a sense of spite, condescension, or deliberate imposition. The nuance is that the speaker is fully aware that their actions will have a negative impact on the other person. It's a very direct and sometimes harsh expression.\n\n*   **Register:** The register varies depending on the specific verb and context, but it's generally considered informal and can be perceived as rude or aggressive, especially if used with superiors or strangers. \n*   **Usage:** Primarily used when the speaker is expressing negative emotions or frustration towards the recipient of the action. It's crucial to use this grammar point with caution and awareness of the social context.\n*   **Gender:** While not exclusively used by one gender, it's more commonly used by men.",
