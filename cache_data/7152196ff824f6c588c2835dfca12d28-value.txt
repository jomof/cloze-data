    "etymology": "「ずして」 is derived from the negative auxiliary verb 「ず」, which indicates negation, and the particle 「して」, which functions similarly to 「～て」 and connects clauses. The combination creates the nuance of performing an action 'without' the preceding verb.",
    "writeup": "「ずして」 is a formal expression that means \"without doing something\". It's often used in written Japanese and formal speech. It indicates that an action is performed without another action taking place. It's similar in meaning to 「～ないで」 and 「～ずに」, but is considered more formal and literary.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   The verb 「する」 (to do) becomes 「せずして」.\n*   This grammar point is rarely used in casual conversation.",
