    "etymology": "「たて」 comes from the verb 「立てる（たてる）」, which means \"to stand\" or \"to set up\". The suffix 「たて」 retains a sense of immediacy, indicating that something has just been completed.",
    "writeup": "「たて」, originating from the verb 「立てる」 (tateru, \"to stand\"), functions as a suffix in Japanese, typically attached to the conjunctive form (masu-stem) of verbs. It conveys that something has \"just been finished\" or is \"freshly finished\". As a suffix, 「たて」 transforms verbs into nouns. Consequently, it can be followed by the particle 「の」 and a noun to modify it. This suffix emphasizes the moment immediately after an action's completion, rather than merely stating that the action is finished. Therefore, 「たて」 is often used with verbs where quality degrades over time after completion, such as freshly cooked food or newly picked produce.",
