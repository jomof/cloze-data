  "writeup": "This grammar point, \"ざるを得ない\", expresses the feeling of having no alternative but to do something. It's a formal expression, often used in situations requiring a degree of seriousness.  The structure itself is fascinating; it combines the archaic attributive form of the verb \"ざる\" (from \"ざり,\" an older negation) with \"得る\" ('to obtain' or 'to be able to') and the negative auxiliary verb \"ない.\"  This creates a double negative, resulting in the meaning of \"cannot not do.\"  While it primarily conjugates like a regular negative verb,  the conjugation with the verb \"する\" is unique, using \"せざる\" instead of the expected \"しざる.\" This reflects the grammar's historical roots.  It's crucial to note the formal register, making it less suitable for casual conversations.",
