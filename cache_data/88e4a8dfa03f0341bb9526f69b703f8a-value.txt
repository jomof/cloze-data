    "etymology": "The past tense form of い-adjectives is created by taking the stem of the adjective (removing the い) and adding 「かった」. 「かった」 is the past tense form of the auxiliary verb 「ある」 in its adjectival form. The polite form 「かったです」 then adds 「です」, which originates from the polite copula 「ございます」.",
    "writeup": "To create the past form of い-adjectives, you must conjugate the adjective stem and add 「た」. The adjective stem is created by removing the い and replacing it with 「かっ」. This is equivalent to \"was\" or \"were\" in English. For example, 「面白い」 (omoshiroi - interesting) in its base (dictionary) form becomes 「面白かった」 (omoshirokatta) in the past tense.  Adding 「です」 after 「かった」 is considered standard polite past form. While this is considered polite by many, using 「です」 after 「かった」 is not academically correct Japanese. However, its usage has become so common that it can be used in almost any situation confidently.",
