    "etymology": "「次第 (shidai)」 originally means \"order,\" \"sequence,\" or \"circumstances.\" The grammar point retains the nuance that the outcome or subsequent action is determined by a preceding factor or condition. It indicates a direct relationship between one thing and another, where the former dictates the latter.",
    "writeup": "「次第だ」 and 「次第で」 indicate that something depends on a preceding noun. 「次第だ」 is used at the end of a sentence, while 「次第で」 connects to another clause. The nuance is that the outcome or a specific situation is directly influenced or determined by the preceding noun.\n\nIt's crucial to grasp that 「次第」 expresses a **direct dependency**. The thing it depends on (the noun) is the primary factor influencing the result or the situation. This is frequently used when highlighting that a person or a particular situation is in control of what happens next. The expression is versatile and appears in various contexts, such as expressing conditions, decisions, or results.",
