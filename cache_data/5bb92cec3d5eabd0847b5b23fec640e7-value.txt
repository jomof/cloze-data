    "etymology": "The particle 「たり」is derived from the verb 「足る(たる)」(taru), meaning \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be enough\". When used in the 「たり〜たりする」construction, it signifies that the listed actions or states are examples, and there may be more that are not explicitly mentioned. The verb 「する」 at the end is a generic verb meaning \"to do\", used to finalize the list.",
    "writeup": "The 「たり〜たりする」 grammar point is used to list non-exhaustive examples of actions, conditions, or states. It indicates that the things mentioned are just some of the possibilities, and there may be more that are not specifically listed. Unlike the て form, which implies a sequence or order, 「たり〜たりする」 suggests that the order is not important or that the actions happen intermittently. For verbs, you conjugate to past informal (た-form) + 「り」. い-adjectives are conjugated to past informal + 「り」. For nouns and な-adjectives, you attach 「だったり」. The final 「たり」 is often followed by 「する」 to complete the sentence. It is important to note that when using a する verb at the end of a sequence, the 「たり」 is sometimes omitted.",
