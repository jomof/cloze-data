    "etymology": "The term 何しろ (nani shiro) comes from 何 (nani, \"what\") and しろ (shiro), which is the imperative form of する (suru, \"to do\"). Literally, it means \"do whatever it may be,\" which evolved to mean \"in any case\" or \"anyway.\"",
    "writeup": "**何しろ (nani shiro)** is an adverb used to emphasize the inevitability or importance of a situation. It translates to \"anyway,\" \"after all,\" or \"in any case.\" It is often used at the beginning of a sentence or clause to introduce a reason or explanation. It's similar to saying \"it can't be helped because…\" or \"no wonder because…\" Think of it as highlighting the obvious or unavoidable nature of something.",
