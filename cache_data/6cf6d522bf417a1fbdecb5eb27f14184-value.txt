    "etymology": "The particle 「か」 originally served as a question marker. Its use to indicate 'or' stems from presenting options as a form of implied question: 'Is it A? Is it B?' The sense of questioning evolved into offering alternatives.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「か」, often translated as \"or,\" presents alternatives. It functions similarly to a question mark, offering options. It connects nouns, phrases, or even clauses. 「か」 can be used after almost any word. Although often used in questions, it's essential to note that it isn't *always* a question. It can simply list possibilities. Adding 「です」or「ます」 will make it a question.",
