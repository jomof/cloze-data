  "writeup": "The grammar point \"にまつわる\" uses the u-verb まつわる, meaning 'to coil around,'  to create a formal construction following nouns. It indicates that something broadly relates to, or discusses, the preceding noun.  Think of it as 'surrounding (A),' 'associated with (A),' or 'connected to (A).'  Typically, にまつわる sits between two nouns—the topic (A) and the subject matter related to that topic (B).  Frequently, (B) involves information or explanation, often seen with words like 話 (tale), 物語 (story), 伝説 (legend), or 神話 (myth).  Interestingly, the kanji 纏わる is shared with 纏まる, meaning 'to come together' or 'to consolidate.' This connection reinforces the sense of 'coming together around (A)' inherent in にまつわる. While the kanji itself is rarely used in modern daily communication, understanding this etymological nuance helps to grasp the subtler connotations of the grammar point. This grammar point is more formal and less frequently used in casual conversations.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while the base form of まつわる is relatively common, the politeness level should be adjusted to match the context of your conversation.  The formal register of にまつわる generally suits professional or academic settings, whereas less formal options are suitable for friendly or casual interactions. The choice of pronouns also heavily influences the level of intimacy.",
  "etymology": "The verb まつわる comes from the now less common kanji 纏わる.  The kanji 纏 means 'to wrap around', 'to coil', or 'to gather', creating a strong visual image of things 'gathering' or 'surrounding' a central point.",
