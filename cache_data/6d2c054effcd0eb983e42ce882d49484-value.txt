    "etymology": "The particle 「なり」is derived from the classical Japanese word 「形 (nari)」, meaning \"shape\" or \"form.\" This suggests that the moment something takes a certain form or state, something else happens immediately afterward. It's related to the idea of something's state triggering a subsequent event.",
    "writeup": "「なり」 is an old-fashioned particle indicating that something happens immediately after a preceding action. It conveys the meaning of \"as soon as (A), (B)\" or \"the moment of (A), (B).\" It is classified as a conjunction particle and typically follows the dictionary form of a verb.\n\nThe (B) part of the sentence is usually something surprising, brought about by a strong sense of will or emotion. Additionally, 「なり」is almost always used in relation to other people rather than oneself. This grammar point is more literary than conversational.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   Despite appearing to be a conjugation of the verb 「なる」 (\"to become\") at first glance, 「なり」 is actually one of the readings of 「形」, meaning \"shape,\" and refers to the overall situation of (A) in a similar way to 「ところ」.",
