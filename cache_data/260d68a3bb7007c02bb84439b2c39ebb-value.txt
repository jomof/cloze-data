  "writeup": "には当たらない is a somewhat formal pattern used in Japanese to indicate that something is 'not worth (A),' or that there is 'no need to (A).'  This is a combination of the case marking particle に, the adverbial particle は, and the negative form of the u-verb 当たる 'to strike,' or 'to be on the mark,' 当たらない. Due to this, the literal meaning can be thought of as 'it's not on the mark to (A).' には当たらない will appear directly after verbs in their dictionary form, or する verbs, with or without する.  Additionally, the は may occasionally be omitted without changing the meaning. Rather than implying that something is 'way off,' には当たらない most often simply highlights that a particular situation is not to the extent where (A) would be appropriate. (A) itself is regularly a verb that relates to reactions or feelings. Some examples include 驚く 'to be surprised,' 非難 'to reproach,' 称賛 'to admire,' 感心 'to be impressed,' 喜ぶ 'to rejoice,' and other similar words.  This construction is generally used in more formal settings and less common in casual conversation.",

      "register": "casual",

      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "persuasive",
      "nuance": "The sentence is structured to be persuasive, balancing criticism with justification.  The language is suitable for an informal discussion among colleagues."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "結核は予防接種を受けた健康な人なら、心配するには当たらない。",

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「ねえ」 adds a flirtatious and suggestive tone. The question, 「二人きりになるには当たらない？」 uses a double meaning, literally asking if it's 'worth' being alone, but clearly implying a romantic interest.  This kind of indirect innuendo is common in Japanese flirting."
    }
  ],
  "etymology": "The grammar point hinges on the verb 当たる (ataru), meaning 'to hit,' 'to strike,' or 'to be on the mark.'  Its negative form, 当たらない (atarana), suggests something doesn't fit or is not applicable. The use of には creates a nuanced condition, expressing the lack of need or suitability for a particular action.",
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the formality of the grammar point can be balanced by the choice of sentence-final particles and other expressions.  The core meaning of 'not worth it' or 'unnecessary' remains, but the overall effect can range from casual conversation to formal declarations."
