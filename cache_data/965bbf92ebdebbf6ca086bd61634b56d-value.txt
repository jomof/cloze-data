  "writeup": "だって is a colloquial combination of the auxiliary verb だ and the adverbial particle とて.  It's a versatile particle with nuances depending on its placement in a sentence.  Think of it as expressing a premise or reason, often with a slightly informal, even childish or petulant tone.  When starting a sentence, it highlights the speaker's perspective before explaining or counter-arguing, similar to \"because,\" \"but,\" or \"even if.\"  Ending a sentence, it conveys hearsay, like \"I heard that.\"  The particle とて itself is a shortened form, originally a combination of と and て, with even fuller forms like だとて existing, but rarely used due to their length.  Note that when used after なん, it always follows a noun or nominalized phrase.  When placed immediately after a noun, its function is similar to its sentence-initial usage, conveying a reason or premise, often sounding like でも. This is commonly used by younger speakers and is more prevalent in female speech.  Finally, the addition of もん or もの at the end of a sentence reinforces the speaker's point, further highlighting its informal and emotional character, often used by women and children.",
