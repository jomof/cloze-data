  "writeup": "The adverbial phrase かと思ったら／かと思うと (ka to omottara / ka to omou to) expresses a sudden shift or unexpected turn of events.  It conveys the feeling of a prior assumption being quickly overturned.  \"Just when I thought...\" or \"Then again...\" captures the essence, but the nuance hinges on the unexpected contrast.  The structure typically follows a verb (in its plain past tense – たら – or plain present tense – と – form) or a noun phrase, describing the initial expectation. This is then followed by a second clause detailing the surprising development.  Mastering this phrase adds a layer of sophistication to your Japanese communication, allowing you to express subtle shifts in situations and expectations. The phrase is versatile and commonly used across various contexts.",
  "etymology": "This phrase combines several elements:  か (ka) is a question particle, suggesting uncertainty. と思う (to omou) means 'to think'.  たら (tara) is the conditional ending of the past tense, and と (to) is a quotative particle indicating the speaker's thoughts. The combination creates a nuanced expression that indicates a surprised reaction to a change in circumstances.",
