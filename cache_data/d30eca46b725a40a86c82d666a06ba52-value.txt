  "writeup": "べくして is a combination of the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb べし, べく, and the conjunctive particle して.  It describes a situation where a logical conclusion or natural course of events leads to a specific outcome.  べく itself indicates the word it's attached to as a 'purpose' or 'end goal.'  べくして is often translated as 'as expected of (A), (B),' or 'as was supposed to (A), (B),' where (A) and (B) are typically the same verb, repeated. The literal meaning of 'as determined with the purpose of (A)' can also be helpful to understand the nuance. This expression is quite formal and rarely heard in everyday conversation.  It's a sophisticated way to express inevitability or a predetermined outcome. \n\n**Fun Fact:** As seen in related grammar points like べき and べし, this structure originates from the kanji 可, usually translated as 'permissible' or 'allowed.' However, 可 here simply points to a situation not yet present but certain to occur logically.",

  "etymology": "The etymology of べくして lies in its components: べく, the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb べし (beshi), meaning 'should' or 'ought to,' and して (shite), a conjunctive particle.  The combination expresses a natural progression or predetermined outcome, rooted in the concept of logical consequence."
