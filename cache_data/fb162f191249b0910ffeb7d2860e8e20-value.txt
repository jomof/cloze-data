    "etymology": "The word 「以前」 is a compound of 「以」 (i), meaning 'by means of' or 'before,' and 「前」 (zen), meaning 'front' or 'before.' Thus, 「以前」 literally means 'before before,' suggesting a time or state even earlier or more fundamental than what is being discussed. The nuance is that the speaker believes the topic at hand should be addressed before even considering something else.",
    "writeup": "「以前」 (izen) as a suffix indicates that a topic falls short of even the minimum requirements. It expresses that something else should be considered *before* the stated topic. In English, this often translates to \"before even (A).\" It often carries a critical tone, implying thoughtlessness or irresponsibility.\n\n「以前」 typically follows nouns, verbs in dictionary form, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives. It's usually followed by the particles 「に」 or 「の」, depending on whether it connects to a verb or noun.\n\nWhile similar to 「前」 (mae), 「以前」 emphasizes a larger distance in the past or a more fundamental issue. This emphasis often contributes to the critical tone, highlighting that something should have been considered long before.",
