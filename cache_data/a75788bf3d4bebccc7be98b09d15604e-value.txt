    "etymology": "The grammar point 「て当然だ」 combines the te-form 「て」, indicating a reason or cause, with the noun 「当然 (とうぜん)」 meaning \"natural\" or \"as a matter of course\", and the copula 「だ」. Thus, it literally means \"because of (something), it is natural\".",
    "writeup": "「て当然だ」 is a common expression used to express that something is **natural** or **to be expected**. It's used when the speaker believes a certain outcome or situation is a matter of course, given the circumstances.  The structure is formed by attaching 「て」 to a verb or い-adjective (or 「で」 with a noun), followed by the noun 「当然」 and the copula 「だ」.  This grammar point carries a strong sense of obviousness and is often used to point out things the speaker believes are self-evident.",
