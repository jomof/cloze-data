    "etymology": "The particle 「たり」 is derived from the classical Japanese perfective auxiliary verb 「たり」, indicating a completed action or state. When used in the 「たり〜たりする」 pattern, it signifies a repetition of actions or states, creating a sense of doing \"things like\" or \"sometimes this and sometimes that.\"",
    "writeup": "「たり〜たりする」is used to list **non-exhaustive** actions, conditions or states. It conveys that the listed items are examples, and there may be other unmentioned activities or conditions. The final 「たり」 is almost always followed by 「する」 (or a conjugated form like 「した」). This grammar point is similar to listing with 「～て」 form, but 「たり〜たりする」 does not imply a specific order of events. If the last verb in a sequence is a 「する」 verb, 「たり」 is often omitted.\n\nFor verbs, use the past short (た) form before adding 「り」. For い-adjectives, drop the 「い」 and add 「かったり」. For な-adjectives and nouns, add 「だったり」. Essentially, conjugate to past tense THEN add 「り」.",
