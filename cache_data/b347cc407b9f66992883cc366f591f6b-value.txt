        "Register": "Casual, informal",
        "Function": "Sentence-ending particle",
        "Meaning nuances": "Adds emphasis and a sense of assertion, often with a friendly or familiar tone.",
        "Usage": "Attached to the end of a plain form sentence.",

        "Common Users": "Primarily used by men."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle ぜ is believed to have originated from the combination of the sentence-ending particle ぞ and え.  え is an older variant of the particle い, which conveys a sense of inquiry or seeking agreement, often with a friendly nuance. Over time, ぞえ merged into ぜ, inheriting the emphatic nature of ぞ and the familiar feeling of え/い.",
    "writeup": "ぜ is a Japanese sentence-ending particle used to add strong emphasis to a statement. It's similar to よ but carries a slightly stronger and more masculine nuance.  You can attach ぜ to the end of any sentence as long as the preceding word is in its plain form. For nouns, you'll use the plain form of the copula, だ, before adding ぜ.  \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Familiarity:** ぜ is typically used when speaking to someone you're close to, like friends or family. It suggests a sense of camaraderie or informality.\n*   **Masculine Tone:** While not exclusively used by men, ぜ is predominantly associated with male speech. Women generally avoid it to maintain a softer tone.\n*   **Not for Superiors:** Avoid using ぜ with people of higher status or in formal situations, as it can sound presumptuous.\n*   **Emphasis, Not a Command:**  While emphatic, ぜ doesn't necessarily turn a statement into a command, though the added emphasis can sometimes imply a stronger suggestion.\n*   **Slightly Less Forceful than ぞ:**  Although both add emphasis, ぞ is generally considered more forceful or assertive than ぜ. ぜ often has a lighter, more casual feel.",
