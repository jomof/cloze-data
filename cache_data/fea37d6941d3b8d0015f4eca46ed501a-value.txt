  "writeup": "The particle だに, often paired with verbs, conveys the nuance of 'even just' or 'merely' doing something.  It emphasizes the minimal nature of the action, often implying that a greater extent of the action would be unbearable or unimaginable.  Think of it as highlighting a small, almost insignificant action, which then carries a disproportionately large impact or feeling.  This construction is predominantly formal and frequently appears in literary works, though its dramatic effect makes it popular in anime and manga.  The verb following だに is always in its dictionary form. The choice of verb is crucial, often relating to feelings, imagining impossible or difficult situations, or reflecting on something intense. Etymologically, だに is related to the word だに (even), but its usage here has evolved into a more nuanced particle indicating a minimum threshold of action that is profound in its consequence.",
