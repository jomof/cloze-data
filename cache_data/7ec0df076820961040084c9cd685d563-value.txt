    "etymology": "The word 「好き (suki)」 originates from the verb 「好く (suku)」, meaning 'to prefer' or 'to like'. Over time, it evolved into an adjectival noun expressing a state of liking or being fond of something.",
    "writeup": "「好き (suki)」, meaning \"to like\", is a very common *na*-adjective in Japanese and is used in many different expressions. All *na*-adjectives behave similarly to verbs; their form changes depending on what comes after them.\n\nFor 「好き」, it will be followed by 「な」 when acting as an adjective, or either 「だ」 or the more polite 「です」 when acting as a noun. This distinction is made depending on whether it is linked to another noun or is independent.\n\nIn the example with 「だ」, 「好き」 expresses that the thing is 'likable' (assertion). However, in the example with 「な」, 「好き」 expresses 'likability' as a quality of the noun it is attached to.\n\n**Important Consideration:** 「好き」 is considered a strong adjective in Japanese when directed towards people, so it may be interpreted as romantic interest. 「大好き (daisuki)」 is often translated as \"love.\"",
