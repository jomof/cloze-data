    "etymology": "The grammar point 「んだって」 is a combination of 「ん」 (a contracted form of 「の」 used to explain a reason or situation), 「だ」 (the copula 'to be'), and 「って」 (an abbreviation of 「と言って」, meaning 'said'). Thus, it literally translates to 'it is that (A) was said'.",
    "writeup": "「んだって」 is used at the end of sentences to express something the speaker has heard. It's a casual way of conveying information received from another source, similar to saying \"I heard that...\" or \"(Someone) said that...\". As 「だって」 is a combination of the auxiliary verb 「だ」 and the adverbial particle 「って」, it can be seen as an abbreviation of 「と言って」 ('is said') or 「と思って」 ('is thought'). It is best used in conversations with friends.",

            "conjugation": null,
            "nuance": "This sentence is casual because of 「うらやましいね」, which is a friendly expression of envy. Since the speaker is using 「ちゃん」 when addressing 「サクラ」 it's likely a conversation between close friends of the speaker's same age."
