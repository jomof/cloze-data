  "writeup": "だの, while literally meaning 'of that' (from だ, a copula, and の, a possessive particle), functions as an adverbial particle in modern Japanese. It's used similarly to など (nado) and とか (toka) to list examples, often translated as 'and things like (A)' or '(A) and whatnot'.  Crucially, だの requires *at least two* examples, each followed by だの. These examples usually share a common negative trait or are opposites, highlighting the speaker's frustration or boredom.  The structure emphasizes the speaker's feelings.  It can follow verbs, い-adjectives, nouns, or even quotations.  The range of applicability is broad when opposites are used, while it narrows when similar negative aspects are listed.  Mastering this nuanced particle enhances expressive capabilities in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "だの originates from the combination of the copula だ (da) and the possessive particle の (no).  Over time, it evolved from a grammatical structure into a standalone adverbial particle, reflecting the dynamic nature of Japanese grammar.",
