    "etymology": "「どうせ」 comes from a combination of 「どう」 (how) and the imperative form of 「する」, 「せよ」, literally emphasizing that no matter 'how (A) is done', the result cannot be changed.",
    "writeup": "「どうせ」 is an adverb used to express that a particular state or condition (A) will inevitably lead to result (B). There is usually no way to prevent (B) from happening, as it's considered a natural consequence of (A). In English, this translates closely to phrases like \"at any rate\" or \"in any case.\"\n\nAs an adverb, 「どうせ」 most often appears at the beginning of sentences, before describing the inevitable situation. It often carries a nuance of frustration or resignation that (A) cannot be changed. In these cases, it is often paired with grammar structures such as 「なら」 or 「だから」. This shows that if (A) cannot be changed, then (B) is a good idea, translating similarly to \"if (A), you might as well (B).\".",
