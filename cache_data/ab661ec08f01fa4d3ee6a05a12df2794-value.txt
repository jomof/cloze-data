  "writeup": "ませんか (or ないか more casually) is a polite expression used after verbs to issue an invitation.  It translates roughly to 'Won't you...?', 'Would you not...?', or 'Why don't we...?'.  It's a direct invitation, unlike ましょうか, which sounds more like a suggestion.  While ないか exists, ませんか is generally preferred for politeness, especially with those you're not close to.  To emphasize the shared activity,  一緒に (issho ni, 'together') is often included.  The nuance of ませんか stems from its phrasing—it asks if the listener would *mind* doing something with the speaker. This makes it more polite for invitations than ましょうか.",
  "etymology": "ませんか is a combination of the negative potential form of する (to do) and the sentence ending particle か.  The negative potential form emphasizes the lack of obligation, making the invitation softer and more polite. The か adds a questioning tone, making it an invitation rather than a command.",

      "nuance": "The phrase 「何か、見せてあげたいものがあるんです」 adds a playful ambiguity, suggesting something more than just a simple item. This, combined with the invitation to a private space, creates the flirty nuance. The polite register, while seemingly innocent, subtly underscores the speaker's intention."
