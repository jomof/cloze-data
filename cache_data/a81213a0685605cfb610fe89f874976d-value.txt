  "writeup": "The grammar point だけでなく(て)～も enhances the common だけでなく ('not only... but also') by adding the particle も to emphasize the second element.  While て isn't strictly necessary, it improves the natural flow and separation between the two parts of the sentence.  The structure builds upon the negative conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb だ (でなく), creating the 'not only' aspect.  Note that じゃなく or じゃなくて can also be used, as with other でなく and ではない based structures. This construction is versatile and commonly used across registers, though the choice of じゃなく vs じゃなくて can subtly alter the formality.",
  "etymology": "This grammar point is a combination of two existing elements in Japanese grammar.  The particle だけ (dake) means 'only' or 'just,' while the particle も (mo) means 'also' or 'too.'  The negative form でなく (denaku) adds the negative aspect. The combination creates a nuanced expression of 'not only A but also B,' emphasizing the inclusiveness of B.",

If you want to emphasize the second element and show it's included in the same category as the first, だけでなく(て)～も is excellent.  Other phrases may imply a broader range, a stronger contrast, or a different type of relationship between the two elements."
