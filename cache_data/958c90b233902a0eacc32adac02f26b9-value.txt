    "writeup": "「だけでなく(て)〜も」extends the basic 「だけでなく」, meaning \"not only, but also,\" by adding the adverbial particle 「も」to the second part of the sentence. This emphasizes that the second item is included in the same category as the first. 「だけ」 itself is an adverbial particle, so it primarily follows nouns. The negative conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb 「だ」(「でなく」) creates the \"not only\" meaning. The 「て」is optional but adds a more natural separation between the two parts. 「じゃなく」or 「じゃなくて」can be used interchangeably with 「でなく」and 「ではなく」.",
    "etymology": "「だけ」means 'only' or 'just'. 「で」is the te-form of the copula 「だ」. 「なく」is the negative form of 「ある」(to be). 「も」 means 'also'. So, literally, it's 'not only, but also'.",
