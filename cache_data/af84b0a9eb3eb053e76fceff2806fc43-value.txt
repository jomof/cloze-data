    "writeup": "The grammar point **Verb［れる・られる］** expresses the passive voice in Japanese, indicating that the subject of the sentence is the recipient of an action. It can also convey that something was done without the subject's consent or to their dismay.\n\nThere are a few ways to conjugate verbs into the passive form:\n\n*   **う-verbs (Godan verbs):** Change the final う sound to its corresponding あ sound and add **れる**. Alternatively, you can add **られる**.\n    *   書く (kaku - to write) → 書かれる (kakareru - to be written)\n*   **る-verbs (Ichidan verbs):** Replace the final る with **られる**.\n    *   食べる (taberu - to eat) → 食べられる (taberareru - to be eaten)\n*   **する verbs:** する becomes **される**.\n    *   勉強する (benkyou suru - to study) → 勉強される (benkyou sareru - to be studied)\n*   **くる (to come):** くる becomes **こられる** (korareru - to be come to).\n\nThe person performing the action is marked with the particle **に**, but **から** can also be used when there's no direct physical contact.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Meanings of られる:**  Besides the passive voice (**受け身** - ukemi), **られる** can also indicate:\n    *   **Potential (可能 - kanou):**  The ability to do something. (e.g., 食べられる - taberareru - can eat).\n    *   **Spontaneous (自発 - jihatsu):** Something happens naturally or unintentionally.\n    *   **Respectful (尊敬 - sonkei):** Used to express respect for someone by making them the subject of the action.\n\n*   **Focus on Lack of Control:** The passive voice in Japanese emphasizes the subject's lack of control over the situation. The subject is sometimes called 「なる人」 (naruhito - the person who becomes), while the doer is 「する人」 (suruhito - the person who does).\n\n*   **Displacement Verb:**  The concept of the passive voice in Japanese shares similarities with polite speech (keigo) in that the subject is being elevated or focused upon, even if they are the recipient of the action.\n\n*   **ラ抜き言葉 (Ra-nuki Kotoba):**  This refers to the omission of 「ら」 in the **られる** form, particularly with る-verbs, resulting in the **れる** form. This is common when expressing possibility but is generally avoided in passive, spontaneous, or respectful contexts. While the meaning is often the same,  ラ抜き is more informal and primarily used for the potential meaning.",
    "etymology": "The auxiliary verbs れる and られる originate from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「る」 (ru).  Over time, the form 「らる」 (raru) developed, often used for expressing respect or the passive voice.  The modern forms れる and られる are derived from these older forms.  The distinction in conjugation (れる for u-verbs, られる for ru-verbs) arose from phonetic and grammatical changes over centuries.",
