  "writeup": "The conjunction particle なり, following the past-tense -ta form of a verb, indicates a state continuing after an event.  Think of it as describing an ongoing situation that persists *after* something else happened. It's often translated as 'while... -ing,' 'remaining...,' or 'ever since...'  The nuance often leans towards an undesirable state that continues despite the initial event.  It's frequently followed by a comma or the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb だ (da) or で (de), leading to a secondary clause explaining what is happening during this persistent state. This grammar point adds a sophisticated layer to your Japanese, showing a deeper understanding of the subtle ongoing nature of events.  Important Considerations: The formality of this construction is crucial; it's primarily found in formal written Japanese and is rarely used in casual conversation.  The nuance of 'ever since' applies particularly when a considerable length of time has passed between the initial event and the ongoing state.  This なり is distinct from the なり used as the classic copula; this one originates from the noun 形 (katachi), meaning 'shape,' highlighting the persistent form or state.",
  "etymology": "The なり in \"たなり\" originates from the noun 形 (katachi), meaning \"shape.\"  The construction implies a persistence of a state or shape after an action, hence its use to describe an ongoing condition following a past event.  This is different from the copula なり, which stems from a different etymological root.",
