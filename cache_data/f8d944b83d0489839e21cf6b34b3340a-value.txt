  "writeup": "The grammar point つつある combines the particle つつ ('while doing') with the verb ある ('to be').  It describes an action or state that is gradually progressing or changing.  The verb before つつ is always in its masu-stem form. This construction emphasizes a slow, ongoing process, often involving gradual increase, decrease, expansion, or contraction.  It's frequently translated as 'to be -ing' or '-ing (in progress)', but carries a nuance of gradual change distinct from simply 'continuing'. Unlike ている, つつある is less commonly used with actions involving noticeable physical movement, instead favoring actions representing a change in state. For example, the blooming of a flower is well-suited, but simply 'continuing to eat' isn't.  This is particularly apparent with verbs that have a clear end or completion point. This structure is considered rather formal and less common in casual conversation.",
  "etymology": "つつ is derived from the verb つつぐ (tsutsugu), meaning 'to continue' or 'to succeed'.  The usage of つつ as a connective particle highlights the continuous and progressive nature of the action or state.  The addition of ある, the copula verb 'to be', further solidifies the ongoing and developing aspect.",

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "listener_age": "older",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「あります」 is used due to the speaker's younger age and the listener's older age, maintaining formality and respect.  The use of 「着実に」 emphasizes the gradual and steady nature of the improvement, aligning with the nuance of つつある."

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「ようだ」to add a layer of uncertainty, making the flirtatious implication softer. The use of 「彼」instead of a name suggests a slightly formal but not overly stiff approach, typical of someone trying to establish attraction early on."

  "post_example_writeup": "While つつある emphasizes a gradual, ongoing process of change, it's important to note that the nature of that change is not inherent to the grammar point itself.  The context and choice of verb will always determine whether the change is positive, negative, or neutral.",

    {
      "term": "ながら",
      "meaning": "While ~ing, During, As",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "ながら is more versatile and allows for simultaneous actions. つつある, on the other hand, focuses on the progressive nature of a single action.  It doesn't denote two separate actions happening at the same time."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the focus of the sentence.  If you want to highlight the simultaneous nature of two actions, use ながら. If you want to emphasize a gradual, ongoing change, use つつある.  If the action is simply occurring during another, use ているあいだに."
