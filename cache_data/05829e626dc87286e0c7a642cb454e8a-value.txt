    "etymology": "い-adjectives are considered native Japanese words (和語, wago). They inherently function as predicates, meaning they describe the subject of the sentence without needing an additional verb like \"desu\" in casual speech.",
    "writeup": "A predicate describes the topic/subject of a sentence. The Japanese equivalent is 述語 (jutsugo), which literally means \"statement word.\" As a predicate, い-adjectives can appear by themselves (when the word they describe doesn't need to be stated) or at the end of a sentence.\n\nWhen there are no other words besides the adjective, it's similar to \"It's cute\" or \"It's hot\" in English. We have to guess what the \"it\" is from context.\n\nIn many sentences, either は or が can mark the word/words the predicate describes. Which sounds more natural depends on several factors. Generally, if you're specifically pointing out something as different from others in the same category, が is used.\n\nFor example, 「このお風呂**が**熱い」 (kono ofuro **ga** atsui) emphasizes this specific bath as uniquely hot compared to others. Using は would sound unnatural because it's not the bath's normal state.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   All い-adjectives are words of Japanese origin.",
