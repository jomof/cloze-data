    "writeup": "ずつ is a suffix in Japanese that emphasizes that things occur or exist in specific amounts. It is often translated as \"each,\" \"per,\" or \"at a time.\" Depending on the source, ずつ may also be considered an adverbial particle. However, this does not change how it is used. ずつ is used directly after the number or amount being discussed.",
