  "writeup": "The particle 当たり (atari) functions as a suffix following numbers or counters, indicating a rate or amount per unit.  It's commonly translated as \"per,\" \"a,\" \"apiece,\" or \"each.\"  Think of it as specifying the quantity related to a single unit of something.  While the literal meaning of 当たり is \"to hit\" or \"to meet,\" its usage here is more akin to に対して (ni taishite), meaning \"in relation to\" or \"regarding.\" This nuance subtly emphasizes the relationship between the quantity and the unit being measured. For instance,  \"一人当たり (hitori atari)\" emphasizes 'per person' indicating the base measure is 'one person'.",
  "etymology": "The word 当たり (atari) originates from the verb 当たる (ataru), meaning \"to hit,\" \"to strike,\" or \"to meet.\"  In its particle form, it retains a sense of contact or correspondence between a quantity and a unit.  The evolution into a per-unit marker likely reflects this conceptual connection, suggesting a proportional relationship.",
