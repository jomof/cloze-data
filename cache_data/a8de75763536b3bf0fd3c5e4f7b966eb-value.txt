    "etymology": "The word 「前 (mae)」 means \"front\" or \"before.\" The particle 「に (ni)」 indicates a location or time. Therefore, 「前に (mae ni)」 literally means \"in front of\" or \"before\" in a temporal or spatial sense.",
    "writeup": "「前に」 is used to indicate something that is either 'before something' in time or 'in front of something' in location. It connects to verbs in their dictionary form to indicate actions that happen before another, or to nouns (requiring the particle 「の」) to describe a position in front of something. \n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   While 「前に」 can refer to a location in front of something, 「手前」 is more specific, often indicating something directly in front of the speaker or a particular reference point.",
