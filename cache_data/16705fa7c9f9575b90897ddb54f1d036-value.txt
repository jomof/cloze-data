  "writeup": "The adverb なお, meaning \"still,\" \"even,\" or \"yet,\" adds a layer of emphasis to a statement, particularly when it follows a preceding clause ending in も.  It highlights that despite the fact mentioned previously, a new, often surprising or unexpected, fact remains true.  While often written in hiragana (なお), it's fundamentally a formal structure. The subsequent clause often also incorporates も, reinforcing the additive nature of the new information.  The phrase 今もなお, \"even now,\" is a common set phrase, appearing in diverse contexts, but remember, なお itself maintains a formal register.",
  "etymology": "尚 (なお) originates from the Classical Chinese character 尚, meaning 'still,' 'furthermore,' or 'even more.' Its usage in modern Japanese retains this nuance of emphasizing a continuation or intensification of a state despite prior conditions. The single-character nature of the adverb also reflects its concise yet impactful expression of nuance in Japanese discourse.",
