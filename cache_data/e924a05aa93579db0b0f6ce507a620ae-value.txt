  "writeup": "The particle に, while typically indicating a location or destination, also expresses frequency when used with time expressions.  It shows how often something occurs within a given period. The time frame precedes に, followed by the number of occurrences.  Think of に as marking a specific portion(s) of time *within* a larger timeframe where the event happens. This is crucial to distinguish it from で, which indicates the total duration of an event, not its frequency.  For example, using で would tell you how long it took to do something, while に would tell you how many times it happened in a given amount of time.   This nuanced use of に is a key aspect of natural Japanese sentence structure.",
  "etymology": "The use of に to express frequency is a semantic extension of its core function as a directional particle. The underlying concept is that an event 'goes into' or 'occurs within' a certain time frame a specific number of times.  This development is logical given that the particle marks destinations in space and time.",

      "japanese": "私は一ヶ月に一回友達と遊園地に行く。",
      "english": "I go to the amusement park with my friend once a month.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a simple, straightforward register appropriate for casual conversation.  The phrase 「一ヶ月に一回」 clearly indicates the frequency of the amusement park visits."

    {
      "japanese": "彼は一週間に二回しか歯を磨かないから、口が臭い。",
      "english": "Because he only brushes his teeth twice a week, his mouth smells bad.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Again, this is a casual sentence.  The frequency 「一週間に二回」 is explicitly stated, highlighting the reason for the unpleasant outcome."

      "setting": "informative",

      "english": "I need to sleep for six hours a day.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a slightly more formal register due to the use of 「必要がある」.  However, the core concept of frequency remains through 「一日に六時間」."

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,

    {
      "term": "ごとに",
      "meaning": "Each, Every",
