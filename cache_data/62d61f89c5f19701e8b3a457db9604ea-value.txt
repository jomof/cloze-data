    "writeup": "「だった」and 「でした」are used to express the past tense of nouns and *na*-adjectives. 「だった」is the casual form, while 「でした」is the polite form. Think of them as the past tense equivalents of 「だ」and 「です」.  Remember that *i*-adjectives have their own past tense conjugations, so you cannot use 「だった」or 「でした」with them.",
