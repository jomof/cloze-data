    "writeup": "The noun 「ところ」 (sometimes shortened to 「とこ」) is often used to describe the \"place\" or \"situation\" in which something happens. The primary determining factor for the nuance of 「ところ」 is the tense of the verb it follows. When it is in the non-past form, 「ところ」 means \"about to (A)\" or \"on the verge of (A).\" \n\nWhen the kanji form of 「所」 is used, it often refers to an actual physical location rather than a situation/standpoint. However, native speakers sometimes mistake this. Therefore, seeing the kanji form and the hiragana form are both relatively common.\n\nEtymologically, 「ところ」 comes from the verb 「とまる」 (to stop), and originally referred to a place where one stops or resides. Over time, its meaning expanded to include situations, stages, and moments in time. In this grammar point, 「ところ」 refers to a specific point in the progression of an action, specifically, the point immediately before it begins.",
