    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ないで」 is a casual way to express \"please don't do (A).\" While 「ないでください」 is a more polite version, 「ないで」 by itself is often used in informal conversations between close friends and family. It's grammatically the same as 「ないで」 meaning \"without doing (A), (B),\" but in this case, 「ないで」 acts as a simple request or statement.\n\n「ないで」 combines the auxiliary verb 「ない」 with the case-marking particle 「で」. To use it, attach it to the negative stem of the verb you want someone not to do. The sentence typically finishes with 「ないで」.\n\nIt's most commonly used among friends and family, or in situations where a more direct, less polite tone is acceptable.",
    "etymology": "「ないで」 is derived from the negative form of a verb 「ない」 combined with the particle 「で」. Historically, 「で」 can indicate a cause or reason, so 「ないで」 can be interpreted as 'because of not doing' evolving into a prohibitive request.",
