  "writeup": "The particle 以下 (ika) means \"and below,\" \"or less than,\" or \"not exceeding.\"  It's attached to a number or quantity to indicate an upper limit.  Understanding its nuances is key.  The kanji 以 (i) means \"by means of\" and 下 (ka) means \"below.\"  Therefore, 以下 literally describes something as being 'under' or 'below' a certain value. This makes it slightly different from simply stating a number, conveying a sense of limitation or constraint.  It's commonly used in everyday situations, signs, and official documents, making it a vital part of everyday Japanese. Note that the meaning includes the upper limit itself; for example, '10以下' includes 10.",
  "etymology": "以下 (ika) is a compound particle composed of two kanji: 以 (i), meaning \"by means of\" or \"according to,\" and 下 (ka), meaning \"below\" or \"under.\"  The combination signifies a limit or boundary set from above, implying a value less than or equal to the stated amount.",
