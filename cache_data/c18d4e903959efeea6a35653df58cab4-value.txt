  "writeup": "傾向がある (keikō ga aru) is a slightly formal Japanese grammar point used to indicate a trend or tendency.  It literally translates to \"there is a tendency,\" closely mirroring the English usage.  This structure combines the noun 傾向 (keikō, inclination) with the phrase がある (ga aru, to have).  Because 傾向 is a noun, this pattern can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (preceded by な), and nouns (preceded by の). While がある is the most common form, alternatives exist, such as が見られる (ga mira reru, the trend can be observed).  Importantly, 傾向がある can describe both positive and negative trends.  A crucial distinction: 傾向がある tends to express inherent behaviors or characteristics—static things—whereas 傾向にある (keikō ni aru) emphasizes an ongoing or developing trend, like a declining birthrate.",
  "etymology": "The grammar point's etymology stems from the combination of two independent elements: 傾向 (keikō), derived from the verb 傾く (katamukuk), meaning 'to lean' or 'to incline,' and ある (aru), a verb signifying 'to exist' or 'to be.' The meaning of the combined phrase naturally reflects the semantic evolution of its components, illustrating the development of nuanced expression in Japanese.",
