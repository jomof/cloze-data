    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ように」 expresses a purpose or goal. It indicates doing action A with the intention of achieving state or action B.  When used with verbs in the **potential form** or **negative form**, it often implies that the speaker doesn't have direct control over the outcome but is taking measures to make it more likely. Think of it as \"doing something in a way that facilitates something else.\" You can attach 「ように」 to the dictionary form of a verb. For verbs like 「する」 which don't have a true potential form, use 「できる」.",
