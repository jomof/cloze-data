  "etymology": "The word かたわら (katawara) literally means \"side\" or \"beside.\"  It's derived from the ancient word 方 (kata), meaning \"direction\" or \"side,\" and 傍 (wara), meaning \"near\" or \"beside.\"  The combination thus signifies something happening alongside or secondary to the main activity.  The evolution of its grammatical function reflects the subtle shift from a purely spatial relationship to one of concurrent activities.",
  "writeup": "かたわら, primarily written in hiragana, is a Japanese noun meaning 'side' or 'bystander' in relation to something happening concurrently.  Grammatically, it functions to indicate an action or state happening 'while' something else is the primary focus; 'in addition to' something else; or 'besides' something else.  It typically follows nouns (often with の) or the dictionary form of verbs. Remember that かたわら always comes *after* the main action or state, implying a secondary or incidental activity. Think of it as a side job, hobby, or secondary obligation.  Unlike ながら, which implies simultaneous actions, かたわら indicates independent activities where one takes precedence. This nuance is crucial for understanding its proper usage. It's used more frequently in formal settings and by older speakers.",
