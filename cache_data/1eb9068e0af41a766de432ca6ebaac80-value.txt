    "etymology": "あり is the classical or literary form of the verb ある (aru), meaning \"to be\" or \"to exist\" (inanimate objects). Its use here retains that core meaning but emphasizes the existence or possibility of something within a given context.",
    "writeup": "あり is the literary form of the verb 有る (aru), meaning \"to be\" or \"to exist\" (for inanimate objects).  It functions similarly to なし, but instead of indicating the absence of something, it suggests the **presence or possibility** of something among other options. The nuance of \"among other things\" is key.  あり is often used as a simple affirmative response, implying agreement or acknowledging possibility.  Be aware that while less common, the kanji 在り might appear.  The distinction is subtle: 有り highlights inclusiveness, while 在り emphasizes the state of existence itself.",
