    "etymology": "The verb 「いらっしゃる」 is an honorific (尊敬語, sonkeigo) form of the verbs 「いる」 (to be), 「行く」 (to go), and 「来る」 (to come). Its origin is believed to stem from a combination of 「入る」 (to enter) and 「在る」 (to be), thus conveying a sense of someone important 'entering' or 'being present' in a particular state or location. Over time, this evolved into its current usage as a versatile honorific verb.",
    "writeup": "「いらっしゃる」 is a highly versatile **honorific** expression. It replaces 「いる」 (to be), 「行く」 (to go), or 「来る」 (to come), elevating the person being referred to. **Never** use it to refer to yourself or your own actions. \n\nThink of 「いらっしゃる」 as a way to show deference and respect to the listener or a third party you're speaking about. It's an essential part of polite Japanese and is frequently used in business settings and interactions with superiors or elders. Mastering its usage will greatly enhance your ability to communicate respectfully in Japanese society.\n\n",
