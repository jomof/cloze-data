    "etymology": "The grammar point 「加えて」 comes from the te-form of the verb 「加える」(kawaeru), which means \"to add.\" Thus, literally, it means \"having added.\" Over time, it has grammaticalized into a conjunction meaning \"in addition to.\"",
    "writeup": "「加えて」 is a formal Japanese conjunction that means \"in addition to,\" \"not only...but also,\" or \"on top of.\" It's often used in formal writing and speech. The structure is typically 「Aに加えて、B」, where B is something added to or emphasizes A.  It indicates that B is an extra element or consequence supplementing A. Sometimes 「それに」 is added before 「加えて」 to emphasize the connection between the two sentences, such as 「彼は頭が切れる。(それに)加えて人柄もいい」. Keep in mind that 「加えて」 often introduces something that enhances or magnifies what's already true of A, either positively or negatively.",
