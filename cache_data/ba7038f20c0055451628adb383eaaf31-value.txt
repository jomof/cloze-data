    "etymology": "The particle 「とも」 is thought to be derived from the verb 「共にする(tomoni suru)」, meaning \"to do together\" or \"to share\". Over time, it evolved to express the idea of something happening regardless of other circumstances.",
    "writeup": "「とも」 is a particle that can function as a sentence-ending particle, conjunction particle, or adverbial particle. Generally, it expresses \"even if (A)\" or \"no matter if (A),\" highlighting that \"in spite of (A), still (B)\".\n\nAs a conjunction particle, 「とも」 is paired with words followed by the auxiliary verbs 「う」 or 「よう」, or after い-adjectives in their conjunctive form. The adverbial particle usage appears after い-adjectives in their conjunctive form and a select number of adverbs. It's advisable to avoid this structure after adverbs unless you've encountered it in native material.",
