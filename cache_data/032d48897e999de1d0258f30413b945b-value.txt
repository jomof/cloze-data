    "writeup": "The suffix 「ぶりに」, the voiced form of 「振り」, indicates the length of time that has passed since something last occurred. It can be translated as \"for the first time in (A)\" or \"haven't done (B) for (A) time.\" As a suffix, 「ぶりに」 is attached to nouns indicating a period of time. When followed by 「に」, the sentence provides more information about what wasn't done for that period. Additionally, 「ぶり」 may be followed by 「の」 when directly modifying another noun. It is unnatural to use 「ぶりに」 for insignificant time intervals like minutes or seconds.",
    "etymology": "The term 「ぶり」 comes from the verb 「振る」(furu), meaning \"to wave, shake, or swing.\" In this context, it evokes the sense of \"waving off\" or \"parting ways\" with an activity or experience for a certain duration. The 「に」 is a particle that marks the time after which the event occurs.",
