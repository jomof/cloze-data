  "writeup": "The auxiliary verb よう (yō) in its adverbial form ように (yōni) adds nuance when used with verbs in the potential, negative, or standard forms.  It suggests a lack of complete control over the outcome, implying an attempt to achieve something in a specific manner without a guaranteed result.  We often translate this as 'to do (A) in such a way that will enable (B)' or 'in order to allow (B)'.  Simply attach ように to the non-past form of any verb, maintaining its existing conjugation (negative, potential, or standard).  Note: する (suru, 'to do') doesn't have a potential form; use できる (dekiru, 'to be able to') instead.",
  "etymology": "ように (yōni) derives from the adverbial form of the verb よう (yō), meaning 'to seem,' 'to appear,' or 'to look like.'  This indicates the underlying sense of aspiration or attempt inherent in the construction. The addition of に (ni) transforms it into an adverbial form, modifying the preceding verb.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "お母さんから離れないように手をつなぐ。",
      "english": "I hold my mother's hand so I won't get separated from her.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the negative potential form implicitly, showing the speaker's intention to avoid separation.  The use of 「お母さん」 (okaasan) is quite natural for the setting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "泥棒が入れないように家の鍵を閉める。",
      "english": "I lock the house so burglars can't get in.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This again uses the negative potential form, showcasing a preventative action.  The casual register suits a simple explanation of everyday actions.  The choice of 「鍵」 (kagi) is standard usage."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼に好かれるように、いつも笑顔で接する。",
      "english": "I always approach him with a smile, hoping to be liked.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「彼」 (kare) by a female speaker for a male listener adds to the flirty nuance. The action 「笑顔で接する」(egao de sessuru) is a soft, friendly approach, typical of early-stage romantic interaction. The sentence subtly conveys a desire to be liked by the listener."

    {
      "japanese": "もっとうまく話せるように、毎日日本語を勉強している。",
      "english": "I'm studying Japanese every day so I can speak it more fluently.",

      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This shows the intention to improve a skill using the potential form. The sentence structure is straightforward and suitable for casual conversation. There is nothing gendered about this sentence."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼が私の気持ちに気づけるように、さりげなくアプローチしている。",
      "english": "I'm subtly approaching him, hoping he'll notice my feelings.",

      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "「さりげなく」(sarigenaku) and 「アプローチ」(apuro-chi) are common in casual settings, especially amongst younger people, and suitable for expressing subtle romantic intentions.  The female speaker's perspective is apparent here, especially with the use of 「私の気持ち」(watashi no kimochi)."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "プレゼンテーションがスムーズに進むように、事前に綿密な準備をしている。",
      "english": "I'm doing thorough preparation in advance so the presentation will go smoothly.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses more formal vocabulary like 「プレゼンテーション」(purezentēshon) and 「綿密な」(menmitsu na) appropriate for a professional setting.  The overall tone is confident and suitable for someone aiming for professional success."
    }

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the choice of verb conjugation before ように significantly impacts the overall meaning and the level of certainty expressed by the speaker.  Pay close attention to the context and the speaker's intended message.",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to distinguishing these similar expressions lies in understanding the nuance of intention and control.  ように emphasizes the speaker's actions to facilitate an outcome without guaranteeing it.  Other expressions might focus on the desired outcome itself, the action of requesting or hoping for something, or acting according to pre-existing rules or instructions."
