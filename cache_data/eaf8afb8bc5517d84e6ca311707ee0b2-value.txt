    "writeup": "**見るからに (miru kara ni)** is a phrase used to express that something is easily recognizable or apparent just by looking at it. It emphasizes the visual aspect of recognition. It's similar to saying \"it's obvious just by looking\" or \"visibly.\" This expression conveys a sense of immediate recognition based on visual cues.\n\n*   It often precedes adjectives to describe the apparent quality or state of something, such as 「見るからに美味しそうだ」 (miru kara ni oishisou da) meaning \"it looks delicious just by looking at it.\"\n*   It can also precede nouns, implying someone or something is obviously a certain thing, like 「見るからに日本人だ」 (miru kara ni nihonjin da) meaning \"obviously Japanese.\"\n\nEssentially, it highlights that a characteristic or condition is easily noticeable through visual assessment.",
    "etymology": "The phrase 「見るからに」 breaks down into:\n\n*   「見る (miru)」: To see or look.\n*   「から (kara)」: From.\n*   「に (ni)」: A particle indicating reason or cause.\n\nLiterally, it suggests that \"from seeing,\" or \"based on what one sees,\" something is apparent. It emphasizes that the conclusion or judgment is derived directly from visual observation.",
