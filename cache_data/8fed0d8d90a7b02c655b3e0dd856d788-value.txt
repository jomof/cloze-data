    "etymology": "The expression 「てしょうがない」 is a colloquial abbreviation of 「仕様がない (shiyou ga nai)」. 「仕様 (shiyou)」 means 'way' or 'method'. Therefore, literally, it means 'there is no way' to deal with a certain feeling or situation, implying it is overwhelming or uncontrollable.",
    "writeup": "「てしょうがない」 is a common colloquial expression used to convey that something \"cannot be helped\" or is \"extremely\" something. It's essentially a shorter version of 「仕様がない」, where 「しょう」 is an easier-to-say variation of 「しよう」. The literal sense is close to \"it's (A), and nothing can be done about it.\" This generally means the extent of (A) is so overwhelming it can't be ignored or avoided. You'll find this structure after the て-form of verbs, い-adjectives (with い dropped and くて added), or な-adjectives (with な replaced by で). While 「仕方がない」 is similar, 「仕方がない」 is slightly more polite, possibly appearing more often in formal writing. This is because 仕方 is a more proper noun meaning \"way of doing\".",
