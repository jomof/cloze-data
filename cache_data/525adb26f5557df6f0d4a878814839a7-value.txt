    "etymology": "This structure combines the particle 「から」, indicating 'from', and the verb 「する」, 'to do'. Literally, it suggests that a number 'starts from' a certain point, implying an estimation where the exact amount is unknown.",
    "writeup": "「からする」 is a slightly formal grammar pattern that follows a number or counter to indicate a minimum from which an estimation is being made. It generally translates to \"about (A),\" \"(A) or more,\" or \"starting at (A).\" It has a literal meaning in that a number is \"going from (A),\" where (A) is the starting point and the speaker doesn't know the exact amount.\n\nIn addition to 「からする」, 「からの」 may be used with the same meaning. However, unlike 「する」, because 「の」 must attach directly to a second noun, 「からの」 is a bit more limited in its usage.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n*   Due to 「からする」 being used for giving an estimation, it tends to appear when the number or amount of something is quite large, emphasizing that the actual number is uncertain. Using it with small numbers can sound unnatural.\n*   「からする」 is frequently used regarding money, while 「からの」 is used when referring to people and other general amounts. For weight, size, or distance, 「からある」, another similar structure, is used.",
