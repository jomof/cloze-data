    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たがる」 is a combination of the auxiliary verb 「たい」 (tai), which expresses a desire to do something, and 「がる」 (garu), which indicates that someone is showing signs of feeling or wanting something. Therefore, 「たがる」 expresses that a third person is showing signs of wanting to do something.",
    "writeup": "As previously covered with 「がる」, this verb can be used with adjectives to express how people are acting. It can also be used with the auxiliary verb 「たい」 to form 「たがる」. This grammar is used when expressing that someone is acting like they \"want\" to do something.\n\nTo use this structure, attach 「たい」 to the ます stem form of any verb, then replace the 「い」 in 「たい」 with 「がる」. For example, 食べたい becomes 食べたがる.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「たがる」 is in contrast to 「てほしい」 which means \"to want someone to do (A)\". These differences will need to be practiced and memorized.\n*   This is also in contrast to the い-Adjective 「欲しい」 \"to want (A)\". To describe that someone seems like they want something (rather than that they want to \"do\" something), 「がる」 will be paired with this adjective.",
