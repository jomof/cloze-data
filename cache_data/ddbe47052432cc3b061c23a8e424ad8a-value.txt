  "etymology": "The word 「つもり」 comes from the verb 「積もる（つもる）」, which means \"to pile up\" or \"to accumulate\". The nuance is that you have 'piled up' the resolve or conviction to do something, or that you have a strong belief or assumption about something.",
  "writeup": "The grammar point 「つもりだ」 expresses intention or conviction. It translates to \"intend to,\" \"plan to,\" or \"believe that\".\n\n*   When used with a verb in dictionary form (dictionary form + 「つもりだ」), it expresses the **intention** to do something. For example, 「日本に行くつもりだ」 means \"I intend to go to Japan.\"\n*   When used with a verb in *nai* form (ない form + 「つもりだ」), it expresses the **intention not** to do something. For example, 「今日は何も買わないつもりだ」 means \"I don't intend to buy anything today.\"\n*   When used with a noun (noun + 「のつもりだ」), it expresses the **belief** that one *is* that thing. For example, 「先生のつもりだ」 means \"I'm convinced that I'm the teacher\".\n*   When used with an adjective, it expresses the belief about the quality of something. For example, 「元気なつもりだ」 means \"I'm convinced that I'm healthy\".",
