    "etymology": "The word 「もし」 is derived from the kanji 「若し」, meaning \"low in (A)\" or \"while slight.\" This kanji is also seen in the word 「若い」 (young). The meaning of 「もし」 reflects this origin, indicating a low probability or a slight chance of something occurring.",
    "writeup": "「もし」 is an adverb used to emphasize the hypothetical or uncertain nature of a condition. It is often used with conditional forms such as 「と」, 「ば」, 「なら」, 「たら」, and 「ても」 to add emphasis to the 'if' or 'even if' nuance. It implies that the condition is somewhat unlikely or hypothetical. Using 「もし」 adds a layer of emphasis, suggesting \"if, by some chance...\" or \"even if, contrary to expectations...\"",
