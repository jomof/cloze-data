  "writeup": "どころか (dokoro ka) is a fascinating particle phrase.  It combines ところ (tokoro), meaning 'place,' and か (ka), a sentence-ending particle indicating a question or doubt.  The transformation of ところ to どころ is a regular sound change in negative contexts involving 所.  The meaning of どころか is best understood as a strong negation followed by an emphatic contrast.  It conveys 'far from,' 'let alone,' or 'anything but' the preceding statement, highlighting the surprising or contrasting reality that follows. While it often pairs with the attributive form of adjectives or verbs, it's not strictly limited to this; it can also be used with the stem form of na-adjectives and even directly with nouns.  Crucially, sentences using どころか always present a contrasting element (B) that significantly surpasses the initial statement (A) in importance from the speaker's perspective.  Mastering this nuance is key to conveying the intended emphasis and surprise effectively.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of どころか lies in the combination of ところ (tokoro), meaning 'place,' and か (ka), a sentence-ending particle.  The change in pronunciation from ところ to どころ reflects a common phonological shift in Japanese when the word is used in a negative context.  This highlights the grammatical function of どころか as expressing a contrast and negation.",
