    "writeup": "「ところを」 combines the noun 「ところ」 (place, situation) with the particle 「を」. It expresses two primary meanings. First, it can mean \"in spite of\" or \"regardless of,\" politely acknowledging someone's situation while interrupting them. Second, it can mean \"when\" or \"while,\" focusing on the interruption of an action. It is often used to express appreciation or apology for the interruption. It is considered formal.",
    "etymology": "「ところ」 refers to a specific point in time or a situation. The particle 「を」 indicates the object of an action. Thus, 「ところを」 literally marks a situation which is being 'used' or 'affected' in some way, either by the speaker apologizing for intruding or by an event interrupting the ongoing situation.",
