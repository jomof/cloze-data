    "etymology": "「そんなに」 is derived from 「そんな」, which itself is a contraction of 「そう」 (like that) and the attributive particle 「な」. The addition of 「に」 turns it into an adverb, indicating the *degree* to which something is like that.",
    "writeup": "「そんなに」, like 「そんな」, is a common way to express that something is \"like\" something else in casual conversation. The addition of the particle 「に」 highlights 「そんな」 as being the \"destination\" of the \"like\" amount. This construction is regularly translated as \"so much\", \"that much\", or simply \"like that.\" As a word, 「そんなに」 is used adverbially, so it may come before any verb, い-adjective, or な-adjective.\n\nAlmost any 「そんなに」-based sentence can be translated literally as \"to an extent like (A),\" where (A) is the word that comes after 「そんなに」, and 「に」 indicates \"to\".\n\nAs 「そんなに」 is another example of こそあど言葉 (words like 「これ」, 「それ」, 「あれ」, and 「どれ」), it means that 「こんなに」, 「あんなに」, and 「どんなに」 may also be used. Despite this, 「そんなに」 is almost considered a set phrase and is therefore the most common out of all the possibilities (except for 「どんなに」, which is often used when explaining or giving reasons for something).",
