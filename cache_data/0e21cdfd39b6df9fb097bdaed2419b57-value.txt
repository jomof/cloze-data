  "writeup": "ため (or 為 in its kanji form) functions as a noun, closely resembling 'sake' in English.  However, it's a non-independent word in Japanese, requiring connection to another element illustrating the 'reason' or 'purpose' it highlights. The particle に often follows ため, indicating a goal or purpose.  However, with past tense verbs, it more frequently indicates a cause or reason. Therefore, a more accurate overall description is 'in light of (A).' This emphasizes (A) as the primary factor resulting in (B).  To use ために in this sense ('because of,' 'as a result of,' 'due to'), attach it to the past tense form of a verb, a noun followed by の, or the attributive form of an い-adjective or な-adjective.  This 'in light of' nuance applies to both past events and the intended purpose of an action.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of ため (ために) is quite straightforward. It derives from the Sino-Japanese word 為 (い), meaning 'to do' or 'to act.' The suffix に adds the nuance of purpose or reason.  This is the same suffix found in other particles, indicating movement or the reason for an event.  The meaning has evolved over time from the act of doing something, to the end result of doing it, and finally to the causality of the end result.",
