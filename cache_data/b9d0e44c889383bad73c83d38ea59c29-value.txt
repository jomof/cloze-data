    "etymology": "ないまでも combines the negative form of a verb (ない), the particle まで (made), meaning \"until\", and the adverbial particle も (mo), meaning \"even\". The literal sense is \"even though not reaching (A), (B)\".",
    "writeup": "ないまでも combines the negated form of a verb, the case-marking particle まで meaning \"until\", and the adverbial particle も meaning \"even\". It's often translated as \"even though not (A), (B)\" or \"it may not be (A), but (B)\". This structure usually presents some extreme (A) that hasn't been reached, but the lower extent of (B) can't be denied. The literal translation is \"even though not reaching (A), (B)\". Depending on the source, this structure may occasionally be used with nouns. In this case, it needs to follow ではない or じゃない. This grammar pattern is used in both positive and negative situations. For example, (A) may be the best outcome, where (B) is something just below that which is desirable, or (A) may be the worst outcome, where (B) is just below that, but still quite bad. Often, the (B) phrase expresses some kind of wish or demand that the speaker wants to meet, using structures like たい, てほしい, てください, たらどう, つもり, and といい.",
