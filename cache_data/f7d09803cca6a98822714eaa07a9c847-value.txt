  "writeup": "好き (suki), meaning \"like\" or \"fond of,\" is a fundamental and extremely common na-adjective in Japanese.  Na-adjectives, unlike i-adjectives, take the particle な (na) before them when modifying a noun. However,  好き can also function as a noun, taking だ (da) or です (desu) depending on the context and politeness level.  When used as a noun, 好き expresses \"liking\" or a preference. When used as an adjective, it describes something as \"likeable.\"  Understanding this distinction is crucial.  \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n* The intensity of 好き can be easily amplified using adverbs like 大変 (taihen, very) or とても ( totemo, very).  Adding 大 (dai) before 好き creates 大好き (daisuki), often translated as \"love.\" However, even  好き itself, when directed at a person, carries significant weight and may be interpreted as romantic interest.\n* This word is used equally across genders and ages, but its interpretation can vary depending on context and tone.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of 好き is quite straightforward. It is believed to have originated from the verb 好く (suku), meaning 'to like' or 'to be fond of'. Over time, the verb form has evolved into the adjectival noun form of 好き.",
