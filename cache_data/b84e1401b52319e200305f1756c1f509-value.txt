It can convey a sense of certainty or confirmation. While generally used by men, younger women may also use it in informal settings with close friends. It is not appropriate in formal situations.\n\nIt's often used to:\n\n*   Express a light assertion, like \"It is, you know.\"\n*   Soften a question, similar to \"I wonder...\"\n*   Add a casual, friendly tone to a statement.\n\nIt's important to note that using 「さ」 can sometimes sound a bit rough or overly assertive, so be mindful of the context and your relationship with the listener.",
