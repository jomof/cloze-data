    "etymology": "The grammar point 「**ずにはいられない**」 is formed from the negative auxiliary verb 「ず」 (old-fashioned equivalent of 「ない」), the case-marking particle 「に」, the topic marker 「は」, and the potential form of 「いる」 in the negative, 「いられない」.  Literally, it means \"cannot be in a state of not doing something.\"",

    "writeup": "As mentioned in our ずに lesson, **ず** is an auxiliary verb that is not commonly used in modern Japanese, except for in set expressions. It has the equivalent role of **ない**, in expressing that something \"has not\", or \"will not\" happen. The case marking particle **に** is then combined with the adverbial particle **は**, and the negative-potential form of **いる**, **いられない**. **ずにはいられない** may be translated as \"cannot help doing (A)\", or \"cannot resist doing (A)\". **ずにはいられない** will be attached to the indeterminate form of verbs. This is the same stem form as **ない** uses.\n\nAlthough **ずにはいられない** is often translated as \"cannot resist (A)\", the literal meaning is simply \"cannot be without (A)\".\n\n**Caution:** As the modern indeterminate form of **する** has several different forms, care will need to be taken when conjugating **する** verbs. While **ない** joins with **し** to create **しない**, **ず** will join with **せ** to create **せず**.",

Finally, 「わけにはいかない」 highlights impossibility or unacceptability. Pay attention to the context to choose the most appropriate expression."
