    "etymology": "得ない (enai) comes from the verb 得る (eru), which means \"to obtain, to gain, to acquire, to be possible\", combined with ない (nai), the negative form of ある (aru, to be). Therefore, it literally means \"not able to obtain\" or \"not possible.\"",
    "writeup": "得ない (enai) is a somewhat formal grammar point expressing impossibility or inability.  It is formed by attaching 得ない to a noun, the dictionary form of a verb, or an adjective. 得る (eru) means \"to gain\" or \"to acquire\", and when attached to verbs, it can mean \"for (A) to be possible\" or \"able to (A)\". When combined with ない (nai), it conveys the nuance of \"unable to (A)\" or \"cannot (A)\".\n\nWhile similar to できない (dekinai), 得ない suggests that there is no *possibility* of something happening, rather than simply lacking the potential.  得る can be read as either える (eru) or うる (uru), with うる being an older form primarily found in literature, rarely spoken.  However, うる is never used in the negative form with ない.  \n\n得ない is more formal than できない, but some set phrases using this grammar point are common in daily speech, such as あり得る (ariuru - possible) and あり得ない (arienai - impossible).",
