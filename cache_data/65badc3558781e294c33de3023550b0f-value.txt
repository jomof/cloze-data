    "writeup": "The verb すぎる means \"to exceed\" or \"to go past.\" When attached to the stem of verbs or adjectives, it conveys the meaning of \"too much.\"  You can attach すぎる to:\n\n*   The **ます stem of verbs**: 飲みすぎる (nomisugiru - to drink too much)\n*   The **stem form of い-adjectives** (remove the い): 高すぎる (takasugiru - too expensive)\n*   The **stem form of な-adjectives** (remove the な): 静かすぎる (shizukasugiru - too quiet)\n\n**Casual Form:**  In casual speech, the る of すぎる is often dropped, resulting in すぎ. This shortened form maintains the same meaning and can be used with any word that normally takes すぎる.\n\n**Special Cases with Negative Forms:**\n\n*   When すぎる is used with the negative form of a verb (ない), the い changes to さ, creating the structure なさすぎる. This expresses \"not enough\" (literally, \"too much not\"). For example, 勉強しなさすぎる (benkyou shinasa sugiru - not studying enough).\n*   When using なさすぎる after a な-adjective, you'll need では or じゃ, similar to regular negative な-adjective conjugations. For example, 静かじゃなさすぎる (shizuka ja nasa sugiru - not quiet enough).\n*   While technically incorrect, omitting the さ in なさすぎる is common among young people in casual conversation. For instance, 勉強しなすぎる is often heard.\n\n**Special Case with いい (good):** The stem form of いい is よ, not い. Therefore, \"too good\" is よすぎる (yo sugiru), not いすぎる.\n\n**Negative Forms of すぎる:**  Be aware that すぎる itself is a verb and has its own negative forms (すぎない, すぎません, etc.). This can create nuanced meanings depending on where the negative is placed. Understanding the different negative forms requires practice.",
