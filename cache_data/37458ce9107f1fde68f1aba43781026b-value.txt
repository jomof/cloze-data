    "etymology": "「がある」 is a combination of the particle 「が」, indicating the subject, and the verb 「ある」, meaning \"to exist\" (for inanimate objects). This combination is used to express the existence of something, and when followed by another noun, it modifies that noun, indicating its association with the existing thing.",
    "writeup": "This expression uses 「がある」 to describe a noun that follows it. The pattern 「(A) がある (B)」 means 「(B) has/with (A)」. This creates a relative clause, similar to an adjective, to describe the noun. In English, relative clauses often require pronouns like \"who,\" \"which,\" or \"that,\" but these are not necessary in Japanese. The noun follows 「がある」 directly.",
