        "[Verb (plain form)] + に違いない": "Expresses the speaker's strong conviction or certainty about something.",
        "[い-adjective (plain form)] + に違いない": "Expresses the speaker's strong conviction or certainty about something.",
        "[な-adjective (plain form, な is optional)] + に違いない": "Expresses the speaker's strong conviction or certainty about something.",
        "[Noun (plain form, no だ)] + に違いない": "Expresses the speaker's strong conviction or certainty about something."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point に違いない is composed of 「に」 (a particle indicating location or state), 「違い」 (chigai, meaning 'difference' or 'discrepancy'), and 「ない」 (nai, the negative form of ある, 'to be'). Therefore, it literally translates to 'there is no difference in,' implying a strong certainty or conviction.",
    "writeup": "に違いない (ni chigainai) expresses a strong degree of certainty on the part of the speaker. It's similar to saying \"there is no doubt that\" or \"I'm sure that.\" It can be used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns in their plain forms.\n\nIt indicates that the speaker is convinced of something based on the available evidence or their understanding of the situation. The nuance is stronger than 「だろう」 or 「かもしれない」.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   This grammar point expresses a high level of confidence, so it should be used when the speaker has a good reason to believe something is true.\n*   The sentence-equivalent that precedes に違いない can be nominalized by の in written Japanese, yielding more credibility to the speaker's assertion.",
