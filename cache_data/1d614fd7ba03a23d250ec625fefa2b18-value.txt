    "writeup": "Almost always written purely in hiragana, **まさか** is a combination of まさ, a word meaning \"precise\", or \"exact\", and the adverbial particle か. In modern Japanese, **まさか** is thought of as a single adverb meaning \"it can't be true\", \"no way\", or \"don't tell me\". As it is treated primarily as an adverb, **まさか** will most often appear at the beginning of a sentence, before some statement about what the speaker is shocked or surprised about.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Surprise and disbelief:**  **まさか** expresses a strong feeling of surprise, disbelief, or shock at something unexpected. \n*   **Often at the beginning:** It typically starts a sentence or clause to emphasize this surprise.\n*   **Not a question word:** Though it ends with か, it doesn't directly form a question. It conveys a rhetorical question or a statement of disbelief.\n*   **Implication of impossibility:** It suggests that the speaker thought something was impossible or highly improbable.",

    "etymology": "まさか comes from 正 (まさ), meaning \"precise\" or \"actual\", and the question particle か. So literally, it could be interpreted as \"is it actually [the case]?\" or \"can it really be true?\". While 正 (まさ) as a standalone noun is rare today, its adverbial form まさに meaning \"exactly\" or \"precisely\" is still commonly used, highlighting the contrast between certainty and disbelief.",
