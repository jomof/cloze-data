    "etymology": "それに is derived from それ (that) + に (to/in). It literally means \"to that\" or \"in addition to that.\"",
    "writeup": "The conjunction **それに** is used to add information to a previous statement. Think of it as saying \"and to that...\" or \"in addition to that...\" where \"that\" refers to the previous sentence. It's similar to \"moreover\", \"furthermore\", or simply \"and\".\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Tone Consistency:** The information introduced by それに should be logically connected to the previous statement and maintain the same positive or negative tone. You can't use it to connect a positive statement to a negative one, or vice versa.",
