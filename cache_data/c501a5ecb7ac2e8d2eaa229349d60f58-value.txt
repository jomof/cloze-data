  "writeup": "This grammar point focuses on forming the negative of う-verbs in Japanese.  Understanding this is crucial for building more complex sentences.  We'll explore the two main forms: the plain negative (ない) and the polite negative (ません).  The key difference lies in politeness level—ない is informal, while ません is formal.  Both forms require modifying the verb stem before adding the negative suffix.  The stem change depends on the final vowel of the dictionary form.  For example, verbs ending in う change the う to あ before adding ない, and to い before adding ません. There's a special rule for verbs ending in う:  they change to わ before ない.  While often translated as 'not,' these negative forms encompass nuances of 'don't,' 'won't,' and 'can't,' depending on context.  Remember that the ない used to negate adjectives is grammatically distinct and should not be confused with this auxiliary verb.",
  "etymology": "The negative suffix ない is derived from the historical negative form of the verb ある (to exist/be). ません is a polite form derived from the verb ます (polite present tense marker).  The stem changes reflect the historical phonological changes inherent to Japanese verb conjugation.",

      "conjugation": "Plain Negative",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The use of 「ない」 makes this a casual statement, suitable for a younger speaker.  The lack of subject explicitly implies 'I'."

      "japanese": "お金は**ありません**。",
      "english": "I don't have money.",

      "conjugation": "Polite Negative",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「ありません」 is used, showing respect.  The implied subject is again 'I', common in informal Japanese context."

      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The particle 「よ」 adds emphasis and is common in casual speech between female friends.  The use of 「ない」 again reflects casualness appropriate for younger speakers."

      "conjugation": "Polite Negative",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "nuance": "The past tense polite negative 「ませんでした」 is appropriate for apologizing.  The absence of the subject reinforces the polite and indirect nature of the apology."

      "conjugation": "Plain Negative",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The question form using 「ない」 softens the directness of the sentence, which makes it suitable for flirting.  The implied meaning is, \"I want to talk more with you.\" The use of 「ない」 also adds a bit of playful defiance. "

      "conjugation": "Polite Negative",
      "nuance": "The use of 「ませんか」 is a polite suggestion, suitable for a first meeting or early relationship stage, implying a shared activity. It is a softer way of asking rather than a direct invitation."

  "post_example_writeup": "Note the subtle shifts in meaning based on context and the choice between ない and ません.  The nuances of 'don't,' 'won't,' and 'can't' are essential to consider when using these negative forms. Mastering this will significantly improve your fluency and understanding of natural Japanese conversations."
