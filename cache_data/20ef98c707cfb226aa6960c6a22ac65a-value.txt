    "etymology": "The 「そうだ」 in this context originates from the verb 「言う (いう)」, meaning \"to say.\" It evolved to convey the meaning of \"I heard someone say that...\"",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb 「そうだ」 has two main functions. This lesson focuses on its use to convey **hearsay** (伝聞), indicating information heard from others. It is used to repeat statements without absolute certainty. \n\nWhen repeating information, 「そうだ」 (or 「そうです」) is attached to: \n\n*   The plain form of a verb. \n*   An い-adjective. \n*   A noun or な-adjective followed by 「だ」. \n\n「そうだ」 implies the speaker isn't 100% sure of the information's validity. It's less confident than expressions like 「ようだ」. \n\n**Important Considerations:** To avoid confusion with 「そうだ」 used for making observations (appearance), remember these differences:\n\n*   **Verbs:** \n    *   「降るそうだ」 (furu sou da): I heard it will rain. (Hearsay)\n    *   「降りそうだ」 (furi sou da): It looks like it will rain. (Appearance)\n*   **い-Adjectives:** \n    *   「寒いそうだ」 (samui sou da): I heard it's cold. (Hearsay)\n    *   「寒そうだ」 (samu sou da): It looks cold. (Appearance)\n*   **Nouns and な-Adjectives:** \n    *   「綺麗だそうだ」 (kirei da sou da): I heard it's beautiful. (Hearsay)\n    *   「綺麗そうだ」 (kirei sou da): It looks beautiful. (Appearance)",
