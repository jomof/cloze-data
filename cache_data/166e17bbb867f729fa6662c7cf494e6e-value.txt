  "etymology": "ようだ is a combination of よう (yō), meaning 'like' or 'as if,' and だ (da), a copula indicating a statement of fact or appearance.  The よう element itself is related to 様 (yō; appearance, manner).  Thus, the overall etymology points to a structure expressing a perceived similarity or resemblance.",
  "writeup": "The auxiliary verb よだ (yōda) functions similarly to みたい (mitai), expressing observations or assumptions.  However, unlike みたい, which is more casual, よだ conveys a higher degree of confidence and is generally more formal.  It suggests the speaker's judgment is based on direct evidence or observation.  You'll often see it written in kanji as 様だ (yōda).  It's versatile, working with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns (requiring な before な-adjectives and の before nouns). While both よだ and そうだ (sōda) express supposition, そうだ implies less certainty. よだ is preferred when the observation is obvious or easily verifiable.",
