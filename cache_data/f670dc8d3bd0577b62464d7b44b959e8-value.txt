    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ている」 is composed of 「て」, the te-form of a verb, and 「いる」, the auxiliary verb meaning \"to be\" (animate objects). In this specific usage, 「いる」 signifies the continuation of a state resulting from a completed action. Essentially, it indicates that the effect or result of the verb's action is currently present. Think of it as the verb's action having 'arrived' and its state 'being' present.",
    "writeup": "As mentioned in our first 「ている」 lesson, this construction is used to convey that someone or something is existing in a constant state of 'doing' the verb that comes before 「て」. Here we will take a closer look at several of the verbs that will be used with 「ている」 to express 'existing in a state of (A) having been done'. All of these verbs would appear as the past form in English, after the initial thing has 'started', 'come', 'died', or 'gotten angry'. However, this is not the case in Japanese. In Japanese, once something is angry, it exists in the state of being angry, once something has started, it exists in the state of being ongoing, once something dies, it exists in the state of being dead, and so on.\n\n**Important Concept:** One of the easiest ways to discern whether a verb will use the 「ている」 form or the past form is to consider if the action can be repeated.  An action like 'start' cannot be done twice, thus it uses 「ている」. Similarly, 'die' cannot be repeated, so it uses 「ている」. This rule applies to the majority of verbs requiring this form (over 90%).\n\nFor instance, if something has fallen and is already on the ground, it cannot fall again. Therefore, 「ている」 will be used.",
