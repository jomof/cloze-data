    "writeup": "The grammar point **ては〜ては** expresses the idea of two actions being repeated in alternation or sequence.  It conveys a sense of continuous repetition of these actions. Often, the actions described by (A) and (B) have some contrasting element.  Think of it like \"doing A, then doing B, and repeating this pattern.\" You'll use the **て-form** of verbs for both parts.  When the first verb is negative, it becomes **では〜ては**.  Shortened versions like **ちゃ〜ちゃ** and **じゃ〜じゃ** exist, but for consistent formality, it's best to use the same short form for both actions. Be aware that sometimes **ては** might appear only once, but the context of the sentence will still imply a repeated action.",
    "etymology": "The structure combines the **て-form** of a verb, indicating a sequential or connecting action, with the particle **は**, which can have a contrastive or thematic function here emphasizing the repeated nature of the two actions.",
