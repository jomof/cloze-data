  "etymology": "The grammar point 'てはいけない' is a combination of the te-form of a verb, the particle は, and the negative potential form of 行く (iku, to go).  The は particle emphasizes the prohibition, although it can sometimes be omitted in more casual contexts. The 'いけない' itself comes from the potential form of 行く, indicating an inability to perform the action.",
  "writeup": "The Japanese construction てはいけない indicates a prohibition or strong suggestion against performing an action.  It's formed by attaching はいけない (literally 'is not able to go') to the て-form of a verb.  Think of it as a formal way of saying 'must not' or 'should not'. While は can often be dropped in other phrases, its presence here is usually crucial to maintain the intended negative potential meaning.  For a more casual tone, consider using the contractions ちゃいけない or じゃいけない, which are commonly heard in everyday conversation.  However, remember that this phrase is fundamentally formal in register, and informal alternatives exist for less formal situations.  This is a very useful expression for situations requiring clear and unambiguous instructions, such as safety warnings, rules, and regulations.",

      "speaker_age": "older",

      "nuance": "While 「しちゃいけない」 is technically informal, it's used here in a formal setting, indicating the severity of the reprimand. The context requires formal language despite the casual conjugation, indicating displeasure.  The use of 「お客様」 (customer) indicates a formal context."

      "nuance": "The use of 「いけない」 makes a definitive and serious statement suitable for older people warning a younger person about potentially harmful relationships.  The use of 「あの人」 (that person) suggests a level of distance. This semi-formal register is suited to the somewhat serious setting."

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while てはいけない is a versatile phrase, there are nuances in tone and formality.

Archaic forms should be avoided unless specifically required for literary or highly formal contexts. Remember the subtle difference in emphasis between synonyms like てはならない and てはいけない."
