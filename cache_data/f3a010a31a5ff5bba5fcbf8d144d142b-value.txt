  "writeup": "The phrases てくれない (tekurenai) and もらえない (tomoraenai) are polite, indirect requests often used in informal settings.  They express a slightly hesitant or pleading tone, implying a desire for the listener's cooperation.  Think of them as softer alternatives to direct commands. てくれない is used when the action benefits the speaker directly, while もらえない is used when the action benefits the speaker indirectly (i.e., the listener is doing something *for* the speaker).  The omission of the question particle か (ka) is common and doesn't significantly alter the meaning; however, including it adds a touch more politeness.  While generally considered standard, these forms carry a nuance of informality.  They're less suitable for formal situations or when interacting with superiors. The subtle difference between てくれる and もらえる is crucial here; the former is for actions performed for the speaker's sake, and the latter is for actions the speaker requests the listener to perform on the speaker's behalf. Understanding this nuance is essential to using these phrases correctly and naturally.  The negative forms, while seemingly polite, still retain an underlying implication of a request and have a slightly softer, more indirect appeal compared to harsher commands.",
  "etymology": "Both grammar points stem from the verb 'くれる' (kureru) meaning 'to give' and 'もらえる' (moraeru) meaning 'to receive'. The 'te-form' plus the negative 'nai' form creates the indirect and polite request.  The 'mora' in 'moraeru' is a prefix often used when a subject requests the action from someone else, indicating indirect benefit to the speaker.",
