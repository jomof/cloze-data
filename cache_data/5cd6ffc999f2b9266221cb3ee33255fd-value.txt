    "writeup": "**向け (muke)** is used to express that something is designed or intended for a specific group or purpose. It essentially means \"intended for,\" \"aimed at,\" or \"oriented toward.\" It attaches directly to a noun. For example, 「子供向け (kodomo muke)」 means \"intended for children.\"  While it indicates a specific target, it doesn't necessarily exclude others.

    It is considered a **造語 (zōgo)**, a neologism or a word created for a specific purpose.  It comes from the transitive verb **向ける (mukeru)**, meaning \"to turn towards\" or \"to direct towards.\"

    You will often see 向け followed by the particle **に** when it precedes a verb or clause, or by the particle **の** when it modifies another noun.

    **Important Considerations:**

    *   Be mindful of the similar expression **向き (muki)**, which comes from the intransitive verb **向く (muku)**, meaning \"to face\" or \"to be suited for.\" While both can express suitability, 向き often emphasizes a natural fit or direction, while 向け emphasizes intention or design.
