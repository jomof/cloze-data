    "writeup": "る-Verbs are verbs that have only one possible conjugation pattern. This pattern simply involves the replacement of る with another construction, depending on the tense of the verb (past, negative, etc.). The name *Ichidan* (一段, \"one-level\") comes from the fact that they have only one stem. In these examples, we can see that る is removed from the verb to create the polite ます form. The る form of the verb is often called \"plain form\", \"casual form\", or \"short form\", depending on the source/book.\n\n**Important Points:**\n*   All る-Verbs end in the kana る. There are no exceptions to this rule.\n*   While all る-Verbs end in る, not all verbs that end in る are る-Verbs. Verbs like 取る (toru, \"to take\") are *not* る-verbs. These can be identified by the fact that the る changes, rather than being removed when conjugated. As the る in 取る becomes り in 取ります (torimasu), we can determine immediately that it is not a る-Verb, but actually a う-Verb.",
