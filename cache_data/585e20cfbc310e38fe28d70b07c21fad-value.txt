    "etymology": "「という」is derived from the particle 「と」 (which often marks quotations or definitions) and the verb 「言う」(iu, to say). It literally means \"that which is said to be.\"",
    "writeup": "「という」 connects two nouns, meaning \"the (B) that is called (A)\" or \"the (B) known as (A).\" It indicates that the noun following 「という」 is identified or explained by the preceding noun. While 「言う」can be translated as \"to say,\" in this context, it refers to information not immediately apparent. Use 「という」 to express information requiring specific knowledge, rather than simple observations. While it's possible to see (A)という(B) when (A) seems obvious, the speaker usually implies that something about (A) isn't exactly as it seems, or that their opinion/knowledge differs.",
