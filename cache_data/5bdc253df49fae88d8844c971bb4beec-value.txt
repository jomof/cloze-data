    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the particle 「に」 with a verb in its dictionary form, followed by the potential form of the same verb negated with 「ない」. The 「に」 in this context indicates purpose or intention, while the repeated verb highlights the desire to perform the action, contrasted with the inability to do so. The variation using the volitional form (「うにも」/「ようにも」) emphasizes the strong desire or attempt, further reinforcing the sense of being unable to act.",
    "writeup": "The 「〜に〜ない」 construction uses the particle 「に」 followed by a verb in its dictionary form, and then the potential form of the same verb negated with 「ない」.  This indicates that one **wants to do something but is unable to**.  The literal sense is akin to saying, \"Regarding doing (A), (A) is not possible.\"  It expresses a situation where, despite the desire or intention, circumstances prevent the action from being carried out. For verbs like 「する」 that don't have a true potential form, 「できない」 is used in the latter half of the expression.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The core meaning emphasizes the inability to perform an action despite wanting to.\n*   The repetition of the verb underscores the desire or intention.\n*   Sometimes, the dictionary form of the verb is replaced by the volitional forms 「〜うにも」 or 「〜ようにも」. While the core meaning remains the same, the volitional form tends to emphasize more concrete or external reasons for the inability, whereas the dictionary form can highlight psychological or internal barriers.",
