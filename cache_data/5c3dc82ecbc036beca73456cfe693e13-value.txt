    "writeup": "ずじまい is a grammar structure that combines the literary form of the classical auxiliary verb ぬ, ず \"not\", and the voiced conjunctive form of the う-Verb しまう \"to finish\", or \"to bring to a close\", じまい. Like しまう, ずじまい will often indicate regret at something ending up a certain way. However, this regret is about '(A) not happening', due to the negation provided by ず. This structure will be used following the indeterminate form of verbs. Common translations include \"to end up not (A)\", and \"to not have done (A) in the end\". ずじまい will often be followed by だった or でした, indicating that (A) was not something that turned out happening, despite the wishes or intentions of the doer.\n\n**Important Consideration:** As is always the case with ず, する will be altered to せず.",
