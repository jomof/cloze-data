  "writeup": "The phrase \"の下で\" (no shita de) literally translates to \"under (something)\" but functions grammatically to express actions or states occurring under a specific condition, influence, or supervision.  The particle \"の\" indicates possession or modification; thus, \"(A) の 下で\" means \"under (the influence/supervision/condition of A)\".  'A' can be a person, an organization, a circumstance, or a set of rules. The particle \"で\" indicates the location or means of the action, specifically indicating that 'under A' is the environment or context in which something happens. This construction is generally formal, imparting a sense of objectivity and precision. It's frequently used in professional, academic, and official settings.  While omitting \"で\" sometimes occurs (in extremely formal writing, perhaps with a comma instead) it’s generally best to maintain this for clarity and natural expression.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's etymology stems directly from the meaning of 下 (shita, meaning 'under' or 'below') and the particle で (de, indicating a location or means).  The use of の (no) to link a modifying noun before 下 is a standard possessive/attributive construction in Japanese grammar.",

The omission of 'de' contributes to the formal tone, making it suitable for a formal thank you, which is then further shown with 「ありがとうございました」(arigatou gozaimashita)."
