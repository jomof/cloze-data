  "writeup": "This grammar point, \"をおいてほかに〜ない\", translates to phrases like \"No...but,\" \"Nothing else but,\" or \"None other than.\"  It's a sophisticated expression conveying that something is unparalleled or exceptional.  The structure combines を (o), a particle marking the object, and おいて (oite), the te-form of 措く (oku), meaning \"to set aside.\"  Following this is ほかに〜ない (hoka ni ~nai), meaning \"there is no other.\"  The overall meaning is similar to 'setting aside (A), there is no other (than A),' emphasizing (A)'s unique superiority.  This construction often carries a positive connotation; the speaker is praising (A) by highlighting its unmatched qualities.  It's important to note that this pattern generally utilizes 措く (to set aside), not 置く (to place), which, while similar in some readings, carries different connotations, especially in formal contexts.   This distinction highlights the nuanced vocabulary choices within the Japanese language.",
