    "etymology": "に originates from the verb 煮る (niru), meaning \"to boil\" or \"to simmer\". The connection to the modern particle usage is not immediately obvious, but it's thought that the original sense involved directing something *into* a state or location, akin to placing ingredients *into* boiling water. Over time, this directional sense evolved into the broader locational and directional particle we know today.",
    "writeup": "に is a versatile particle with several meanings, often translated as \"in,\" \"at,\" \"to,\" \"for,\" or \"on.\" Think of に as indicating the **endpoint** of an action or state. It specifies where something exists, where something is directed, or the target of an action. For example:\n\n*   Location: 彼はあそこにいます (Kare wa asoko ni imasu - He is *at* that place over there.)\n*   Direction: 駅に行く (Eki ni iku - To go *to* the station.)\n*   Time: ３時に会いましょう (Sanji ni aimashou - Let's meet *at* 3 o'clock.)\n\nVerbs like 住む (sumu - to live) use に instead of で because 住む describes an action that finds its completion or finality at the specified destination; you complete the act of living *in* a place.",
