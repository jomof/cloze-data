    "etymology": "「まえに」 literally translates to \"in front.\" It can refer to a position in space or a point in time preceding an event. The temporal use extends the idea of something being \"ahead\" on the timeline.",
    "writeup": "「まえに」 indicates something that occurs 'before' something else, either in terms of time or physical location. When used with a verb, it connects directly to the verb's dictionary form. When used with a noun, the particle 「の」 is required between the noun and 「まえに」.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「まえに」 specifies actions or states that take place *prior* to a known event or time.\n*   Be mindful of the distinction with 「手前に」, which primarily describes something physically in front of you.",
