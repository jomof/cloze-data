  "etymology": "「どうにも」is derived from 「どう」 (how), 「に」 (particle), and 「も」 (particle), essentially meaning \"even if one tries in any way\".",
  "writeup": "「どうにも」 is an expression often paired with negative structures such as 「できない」 (\"cannot\"), 「ならない」 (\"won't happen\"), or 「ようがない」 (\"no way\"). It combines the adverb 「どう」 (\"how\"), the case-marking particle 「に」, and the adverbial particle 「も」. It can be translated as \"even however (A), still not (B)\". The entire structure is usually interpreted as \"it is meaningless to (A)\", \"there's nothing one can do about (A)\", or \"nothing will come of (A)\".\n\n「どうにも」 is typically found at the beginning or end of sentences, introducing a situation that seems impossible due to a specific reason. This grammar pattern emphasizes the speaker's feelings of resignation, frustration, or regret regarding something beyond their control. Therefore, it often highlights the actions of someone other than the speaker. Occasionally, 「どうにも」 is further emphasized by adding 「こうにも」.",
