    "etymology": "「ざるを得ない」 comes from the archaic auxiliary verb 「ざり」 (negative), the verb 「得る」 (to obtain, to be able to), and the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」. The combination creates a double negative, implying that one \"cannot help but do\" something, or \"there is no choice but to do\" something. 「ざる」 is the 連体形 (attributive form) of 「ざり」.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ざるを得ない」 expresses the idea that someone has no choice but to do something. It is a formal expression. \n\n*   「ざる」 is the attributive form of the old-fashioned auxiliary verb 「ざり」, which is equivalent to the modern 「ない」. \n*   When combined with 「得る」 (to obtain, to be able to) and 「ない」, it creates a double negative, meaning \"cannot help but do\" or \"there is no choice but to do\".\n*   This structure generally conjugates like 「ない」.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   When used with 「する」, 「しざる」 is not used. Instead, use 「せざるを得ない」. For example, instead of saying 「勉強しざるを得ない」, you would say 「勉強せざるを得ない」.\n*   When used with 「来る」, 「きざる」 is not used. Instead, use 「こざるを得ない」.",
