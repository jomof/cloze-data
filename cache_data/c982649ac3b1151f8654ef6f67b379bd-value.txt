    "etymology": "なくちゃ is a contraction of なくては (nakute wa). なきゃ is a contraction of なければ (nakereba). Both なくては and なければ are conditional forms of the negative auxiliary verb ない (nai), indicating that if something is not done, there will be a problem.",
    "writeup": "なくちゃ (short for なくては) and なきゃ (short for なければ) are common colloquial abbreviations used to convey that something \"must\" or \"has to\" be done. Like てはいけない (must not), なくてはいけない (must), and なくてはならない (must), these abbreviated forms can be followed by いけない, ならない, or だめ. However, they are usually omitted without changing the meaning.\n\nStructures like this are referred to as spoken/colloquial language. These casual variations can come across similarly to words like \"gotta\" in English.\n\nIn these examples, a variety of forms are used naturally. There is no \"most natural\" form, and it will often depend on the speaker which they choose.\n\nAs with almost all grammatical structures, the shortest variations (not including いけない, etc.) are the most casual and used the most often.\n\nThere are several other ways these common abbreviations can appear based on region or even an individual speaker's preference. An example of this is なけりゃ, which is a very casual form of なければ.\n\nSome of these less common variations are used specifically by certain genders (in general). なけりゃ itself tends to be used by male speakers and may be considered a bit rougher than なきゃ or なくちゃ, which can be used by anybody.",
