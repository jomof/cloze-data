    "writeup": "**好き (suki)** means \"like\" or \"fond of.\" It's a very common **na-adjective** in Japanese, similar to verbs in that its form changes depending on what follows it.

    When **好き** acts as an adjective modifying a noun, it's followed by **な**.  For example, 「好きな映画 (suki na eiga)」 means "a movie you like" or "favorite movie."

    When **好き** stands alone or ends a sentence, it's followed by either **だ** (plain form) or **です** (polite form).  「好きだ (suki da)」 and 「好きです (suki desu)」 both mean "I like it" or "I like you," depending on the context.

    **Important Considerations:**

    *   **Intensity:**  **好き** can be quite direct when used towards people, potentially implying romantic interest.
    *   **大好き (daisuki):**  Often translated as "love," it expresses a stronger feeling than just **好き**.
    *   **Context is key:** The exact meaning of **好き** can vary depending on the context of the conversation.

    Be mindful of the nuance, especially when expressing your feelings towards someone!
