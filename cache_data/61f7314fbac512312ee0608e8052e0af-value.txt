  "writeup": "に至っても (ni itattemo) is a nuanced expression used to emphasize that a particular outcome persists despite reaching an extreme or significant point. Unlike 至っては (ni itatte wa), which highlights the most extreme example within a category, 至っても focuses on the consequence remaining unchanged even after reaching that extreme.  The particle も (mo) adds the 'even' aspect, modifying the base phrase.  It's a combination of the particle に (ni), the te-form of 至る (itaru, 'to reach, to arrive at'), and も (mo, 'even').  It typically follows nouns or verbs in their dictionary form.  While often used to express regret or lamentation—that even in the most extreme circumstances, the situation doesn't change—it can also express determination in positive contexts. Think of it as conveying 'despite reaching the point of X, Y still holds true.'",
  "etymology": "The phrase is built upon 至る (itaru), meaning 'to reach' or 'to arrive at.'  The te-form, 至って (itatte),  indicates the state of having reached a certain point. Adding も (mo, 'even') intensifies the sense that the outcome remains unchanged, regardless of how far things have progressed.",

The male speaker’s vulnerability adds to the romantic appeal. 「僕の心臓」 shows this is directly from the speaker’s feelings."
