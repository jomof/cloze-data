        "[お/ご] + [ます-stem of verb/Sino-Japanese noun] + 願う/願います": "Polite request or expression of desire."
    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「願う(negau)」originally meant “to turn one's face towards a deity and speak.” It combines 「ね(ne)」(root of 祈る in ancient Japanese, meaning to pray) and 「向かう(mukau)」(to face towards).",
    "writeup": "「願う(negau)」/「願います(negai masu)」 is a verb used to express a polite request, wish, or hope. It's often used in formal settings and written communication. The verb 「願う」is often attached to the ます-stem of other verbs with お/ご to form a polite request. It's more formal than 「～てください」. \n\nFor example, 「ご協力願います (go-kyōryoku negai masu)」means \"please cooperate,\" and 「お待ち願います (o-machi negai masu)」 means \"please wait.\"\n\n*   **Important Considerations**:\n    *   Using 「願う」 directly (without attaching it to another verb) typically expresses a wish or hope, similar to 「～を祈る (inoru)」(to pray). For example, 「成功を願っています (seikō o negatte imasu)」 means \"I am hoping for your success.\" This construction is less common than using it for requests.\n    *   When making a request, the structure 「お/ご～願います」 is highly formal and often used in business or official contexts. It carries a sense of respect and may sound overly polite in casual situations.",

            "etymology": "「成功」 means success, 「願う」 means to wish. 「～ています」 gives the continuous aspect, 'I am wishing.'"
