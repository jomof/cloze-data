  "writeup": "ないでください is a polite way to ask someone not to do something.  It combines the negative form of a verb (verb stem + ない), the particle で, and ください, the polite imperative form of くださる (to give/do something for someone). ください adds a layer of politeness and formality, making it suitable for various situations.  While ください is derived from the honorific verb くださる, its usage here is primarily for making requests, not necessarily indicating honor toward the listener.  In informal settings,  the ください can be dropped, leaving just ないで, which functions as a casual 'please don't'.  However, using ないでください maintains a consistently polite tone, even in informal contexts where the shorter form might be acceptable among close friends or family.  This is crucial to understand to avoid unintentionally being rude.",
