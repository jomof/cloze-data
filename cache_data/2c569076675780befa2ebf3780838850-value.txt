  "writeup": "The grammar point \"～は～で有名\" (～wa～de yūmeih) means \"(something) is famous for (something else)\".  It's a common and versatile way to express fame.  The structure hinges on the particles \"は\" (wa, topic marker), \"で\" (de, indicating the reason or means of fame), and the noun \"有名\" (yūmeih, famous).  Let's break it down:  The topic (A) is introduced with \"は\". Then, \"で\" specifies what (A) is famous *for* – the reason for its fame. Finally, \"有名\" asserts the fame itself.  This isn't just a simple \"famous for\" – it's a more nuanced description emphasizing *the reason behind* the fame.   Using \"こと\" (koto, thing) or \"の\" (no, possessive particle) before \"で有名\" is perfectly acceptable, particularly when describing a complex concept or activity as the source of fame.  This construction is generally applicable across registers, but choosing polite forms like \"です\" (desu) for the final part will dictate the overall politeness of the sentence.",

  ],
  "etymology": "The word \"有名\" (yūmeih) is composed of \"有\" (yuu, to have, possess) and \"名\" (mei, name, reputation).  It literally means \"to have a name,\" implying widespread recognition and renown.",
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the choice of particle  \"で\" (de) highlights the reason or means of fame. This contrasts with other structures that simply state fame without specifying the cause."
