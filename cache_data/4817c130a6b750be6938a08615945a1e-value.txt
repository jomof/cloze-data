        "Noun + はあれ": "Even though there is [noun].",
        "[Statement], (though) + はあれ": "Expresses concession, acknowledging the existence of a certain condition or situation, while still making a statement that might seem contradictory or unexpected in light of that condition."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「はあれ」combines the topic marker 「は」 with 「あれ」, which is the imperative form of the verb 「ある」 (to exist). It literally means \"though it exists,\" indicating that despite the existence of something, the main point still holds true.",
    "writeup": "「はあれ」is a phrase used to express concession. It conveys the idea that *even though* something exists or is true, it doesn't negate the subsequent statement. It's similar to saying \"although there is\" or \"even though there are.\"\n\nIt is primarily used in formal writing and speech. The nuance it adds is one of acknowledging a potential objection or contradictory element before proceeding with the main point.  It often implies a certain level of acceptance or resignation regarding the acknowledged condition. \n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   The part before 「はあれ」is usually a noun or a short clause.\n*   This grammar is not commonly used in casual conversation.",
