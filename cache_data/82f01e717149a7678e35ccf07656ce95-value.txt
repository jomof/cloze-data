    "etymology": "The term 「どうしても」 is derived from the adverb 「どう」 (how) combined with the 「ても」 form of the verb 「する」 (to do), resulting in 「どうしても」 which literally means \"even if doing how\". This implies a situation where the outcome remains the same regardless of the method or effort.",
    "writeup": "「どうしても」 functions primarily as an adverb, conveying a sense of inevitability or strong will. It essentially means \"no matter what\" or \"regardless of the circumstances\".  It's used to express something the speaker feels is unavoidable or something they are determined to do.  You'll often find it at the beginning of a sentence to emphasize the certainty of the following statement. When used with a verb and the particle 「と」, it indicates that a certain outcome will invariably follow a particular action.  Think of it as highlighting an unbreakable connection between two things. It's a versatile term used in everyday conversation across various age groups.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these expressions share the idea of 'no matter what' or 'regardless of', 「どうしても」 carries a distinct nuance of personal will or an unavoidable outcome. Be mindful of the specific context. Expressions like 「どんなに〜ても」 and 「いくら〜でも」 focus on degree, while 「にかかわらず」 and 「を問わず」 emphasize that a condition doesn't change the outcome. 「にせよ・にしろ」 and 「にしても～にしても」 present alternatives. Understanding these subtle differences will improve your accuracy."
