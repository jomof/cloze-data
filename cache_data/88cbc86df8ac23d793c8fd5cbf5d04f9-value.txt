    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないうちに」 combines the negative form 「ない」 of a verb with 「うちに」 (uchi ni), which means \"while\" or \"during.\" Thus, it literally means \"while not\" something is happening, implying the action is taken before that state is reached.",
    "writeup": "「ないうちに」 is used to express that something is done before a certain (usually undesirable) condition occurs. It emphasizes taking action to prevent something negative from happening or noting that something occurred without one's awareness. It often highlights an unfavorable result if the action isn't taken promptly. It is often used to express the idea of \"before it's too late\" or \"without realizing it.\"",
