    "etymology": "The verb 「くれる」originally meant 「呉れる」, written with the kanji 呉 which refers to the ancient Chinese kingdom of Wu. This reflects the idea of bestowing something upon someone, similar to how the kingdom of Wu might have offered tribute or gifts. Over time, the kanji usage became less common, and the hiragana form くれる became standard.",
    "writeup": "「くれる」is one of the three fundamental verbs for giving and receiving in Japanese, alongside 「あげる」and 「もらう」. 「くれる」 specifically means 'to give' to you or someone in your 'in-group'. This 'in-group' typically includes family, close friends, or members of a group you belong to.\n\nWith 「くれる」and 「あげる」, the particle 「が」marks the giver, and 「に」marks the recipient. 「を」marks the object being given, as usual.\n\nOften, the giver or recipient is omitted, as it's clear from context. The focus might be on the object being given. For example, saying just 「プレゼントをくれた」 implies someone gave a gift to the speaker.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The giver is usually someone more distant than your 'in-group'.\n*   To say you (or someone else) gave something to someone *outside* your 'in-group', use 「あげる」instead. For example, 「私は先生に本をあげました」 (I gave the teacher a book).\n* 「くれる」can also be used when the speaker is not the direct recipient but benefits indirectly. For example, 「友達が親切にしてくれた」 (My friend was kind to me [and that benefited me]).",
