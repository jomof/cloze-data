  "writeup": "The particle とか, a combination of と and か, quotes a previous statement as hearsay, implying uncertainty or lack of confirmation.  In English, it translates to \"I heard something like (A)\" or \"(A) or something was said.\"  とか can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns.  The \"or something\" nuance is informal and common in casual conversation.  **Important Consideration:**  This differs from the とか used in lists; that's a single listing particle, while this is a combination of the case-marking particle と and the adverbial particle か.  However, both structures stem from と and か, leading to some semantic overlap.",
  "etymology": "とか is a combination of the particle と (to), indicating a quoted element or a conjunction, and the particle か (ka), expressing a question or uncertainty.  Its usage reflects the blending of these two grammatical functions to create an expression conveying hearsay or imprecise information.",
