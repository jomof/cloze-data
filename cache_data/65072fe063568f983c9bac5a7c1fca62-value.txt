    "etymology": "The use of the masu-stem (the polite stem) of a verb as a noun comes from the inherent nature of Japanese verbs to express a concept beyond just the action itself. The masu-stem, stripped of its politeness ending, takes on a more direct nominal quality. The patterns 「〜ます」and「〜ません」are considered polite speech; removing 「〜ます」leaves the stem, which is then used as a noun.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point involves using the **masu-stem** of a verb as a noun. By dropping the 「ます」 and treating the remaining stem as a noun, you can describe an action or state as a concept. This is a versatile way to talk about activities, processes, or states of being in a more abstract or conceptual way. The resulting nominalized verb can then be combined with other nouns or particles to form more complex phrases. For example, 「読み書き」 (yomikaki) means 'reading and writing.'",
