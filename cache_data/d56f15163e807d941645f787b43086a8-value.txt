    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed by the て-form of a verb followed by the verb 来る (くる), meaning \"to come\".  The て-form indicates a sequence of actions or a state, and when combined with 来る, it signifies that the action is moving towards the speaker or the present moment. It can also indicate a change that has progressed over time, reaching the current state.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **てくる** combines the て-form of a verb with the verb **来る (くる)**, \"to come\".  It expresses several related meanings, primarily focusing on movement towards the speaker or the present. \n\n**Key Nuances:**\n\n*   **Physical movement**: Indicating that something or someone is coming towards the speaker's location.  In this case, the kanji form 来る is common.\n*   **Change over time**:  Describing a change that has developed or progressed until the present. This often translates to \"to become\" or \"to start to\".\n*   **Continuation of an action**: Implying that an action has been ongoing up to the present moment. This can often be translated as \"has been ~ing\".\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Directionality**:  The core meaning involves movement or progression towards the present or the speaker.\n*   **Contrast with ていく**:  Be mindful of the difference between **てくる**, which signifies coming towards, and **ていく**, which indicates moving away or continuing into the future.\n*   **Context is key**: The specific nuance of **てくる** depends heavily on the verb it's attached to and the overall context of the sentence.",
