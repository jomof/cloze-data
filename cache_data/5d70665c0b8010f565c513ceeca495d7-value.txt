    "etymology": "「何」 (nan) means \"what\" or \"how many,\" and 「も」 (mo) adds emphasis, indicating \"also\" or \"even.\" When used with a counter, it conveys the sense of \"many\" or \"a large number of.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「何+Counter+も」 is used to express a large quantity or number of something. 「何」 here doesn't mean \"what,\" but rather functions as an indefinite quantifier, similar to \"many\" or \"several\" in English. The counter word used must be appropriate for the noun being counted. For example, you would use 「人」 (nin) to count people and 「冊」 (satsu) to count books. It's important to choose the correct counter to avoid sounding unnatural.  The number is optional.  「何百冊も」 (nan-hyaku satsu mo) means \"hundreds of books,\" while 「何人も」 (nan-nin mo) means \"many people.\"",
