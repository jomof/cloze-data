  "etymology": "The structure に限らず combines に (particle indicating the target of an action or state), 限る (kagireru, to limit, restrict), and the negative auxiliary ず (zu).  限る itself comes from the verb 限む (kagimu), meaning \"to be limited\". The ず suffix negates the verb, resulting in 'not limited to'.",
  "writeup": "The Japanese grammar point に限らず (ni kagirazu) translates to \"not only… but also\" or \"not just… but also.\"  It's a versatile phrase used to indicate that something applies to a broader scope than initially stated.  It's more formal than the similar phrase だけでなく (dakedeniwa).  The structure is typically used after a noun phrase, followed by the broader scope.  You can also use も (mo, also/too) for added emphasis when listing multiple additional things. For example:  Aに限らず、BもCも (A ni kagirazu, B mo C mo). This translates to \"Not only A, but also B and C\". This construction is useful for expanding on a point and showing comprehensiveness in your explanation or argument.  Important Considerations:  While grammatically correct, using this in overly casual conversations might sound stiff or overly formal.",
