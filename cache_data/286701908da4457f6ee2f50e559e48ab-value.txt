  "writeup": "てしょうがない is a common colloquial expression used to emphasize the extent of a feeling or situation.  It conveys the idea that something is 'extremely (A)' or 'so (A) that it can't be helped'.  This structure is a shortened version of the noun 仕様 (しよう), meaning 'specification' or 'method', with しょう being a more casual pronunciation. The literal meaning is close to '(A) is the case, and nothing can be done about it'. However, in practice, it simply indicates an intense degree of (A).  You'll often see this structure following the て-form of verbs, い-adjectives, or the で-form of な-adjectives.  While 仕方がない (shikata ga nai) can also be used and has a similar meaning, there's a subtle difference.  仕方がない is generally considered slightly more polite and is more frequently encountered in formal writing.",
  "etymology": "The expression originates from the noun 仕様 (shiyō), meaning 'specification' or 'method'.  The more casual pronunciation しょう (shō) makes it more readily used in daily conversation.  The combination with the て-form creates a descriptive phrase highlighting the intensity of a feeling or circumstance.",
