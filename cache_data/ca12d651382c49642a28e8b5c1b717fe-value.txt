    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the -て form of a verb, くれる (kureru, to give), and ありがとう (arigatou, thank you). くれる indicates that someone did something for the speaker's benefit, and ありがとう expresses gratitude for that action. Therefore, it literally translates to \"Thank you for giving me the favor of doing ~.\"",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「てくれてありがとう」, builds upon 「てくれる」, which expresses that someone performed an action for the speaker or someone close to them. 「てくれてありがとう」 directly thanks someone for that specific action. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   This expression is most natural when used for actions that clearly benefit the speaker. It might sound awkward or insincere if used for actions someone is expected to do as part of their job or as a matter of simple etiquette.",
