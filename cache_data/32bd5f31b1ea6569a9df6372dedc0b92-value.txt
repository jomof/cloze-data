    },
    "etymology": "「ただ」 means \"merely\" or \"only\", emphasizing the limited scope of what follows. 「のみ」functions as an adverbial particle meaning \"just\" or \"only\", adding further emphasis. The combination creates a strong sense of limitation.",
    "writeup": "「ただ〜のみ」 is a formal expression indicating that nothing else is possible, necessary, or relevant except for what is stated. It conveys the idea of \"nothing but,\" \"only,\" or \"all that remains.\" It's a combination of 「ただ」, meaning \"merely\" or \"only,\" and 「のみ」, an adverbial particle meaning \"just\" or \"only.\" 「のみ」 is similar to 「だけ」 and 「ばかり」 but more formal.\n\nFrequently, what precedes 「ただ〜のみ」 is a verb of movement, continuation, or hope, highlighting that all possible actions have been taken, and the only thing left is to wait or continue. With する verbs, 「する」 may be replaced by 「ある」, which emphasizes the existence of the action rather than the action itself and is more common in literary contexts. This expression is primarily used in formal speech and writing.",
