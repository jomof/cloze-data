    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the particle 「だけ」 (only), and 「まし」, which is the conjunctive form of the adjective 「良い」 (good) as well as the noun 「増し」 (increase). The 「だ」 is the plain form of the copula 「です」, indicating affirmation.",
    "writeup": "「だけましだ」 is a set phrase indicating \"at least (A)\", or that \"one should feel grateful for (A).\" This expression is often used when the overall situation is negative, but it is still better than the alternative. The structure combines the particle 「だけ」 (only) and the adjective 「増し」, meaning 'better' or 'preferable.' Originally, 「まし」 is the conjunctive form of 「増す」, a verb meaning 'to grow' or 'increase.' The literal meaning is 'even just (A) is a plus, compared to what could have occurred.' 「だけましだ」 will generally follow verbs, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives followed by な. In most cases, 「まし」 will be written in hiragana, or even katakana as 「マシ」. The katakana version often further emphasizes gratitude for (A).\n\nImportant consideration: Although less common, 「だけまだましだ」 may also be encountered. The addition of 「まだ」 (still) emphasizes the point even further.",
