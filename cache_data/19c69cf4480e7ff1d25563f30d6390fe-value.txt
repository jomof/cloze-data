  "etymology": "This grammar point combines the particle にも, expressing emphasis and inclusion, with the negative ない form of a verb.  The volitional form (～よう) further emphasizes the speaker's desire or intent, highlighting the frustration of inability. The negative potential form (～られない) focuses on the impossibility of the action.",
  "writeup": "The grammar point \"にも～ない\" expresses the inability to do something despite wanting to. It's often used with volitional verbs (expressing intention or will), creating a sense of frustration or helplessness.  The structure repeats the verb stem, once in the volitional form (～よう) and again in the negative potential form (～られない/～れません). This emphasizes both the speaker's desire and the insurmountable obstacle preventing the action.  For example, \"帰ろうにも帰れない\" (kikaerou ni mo kaerenai) literally means 'Even if I try to go home, I can't go home,' highlighting the futility of the attempt.  Important Considerations: Unlike the similar \"に～ない\" which pairs directly with the dictionary form of a verb, \"にも～ない\" generally implies a greater external constraint rather than a mere lack of ability or desire.  The choice between potential and volitional conjugation depends on the desired nuance. The volitional form emphasizes the speaker's strong intent, while the potential form subtly shifts the emphasis to the inability itself.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "帰ろうにも帰れない。",
      "english": "I can't go home, even if I want to.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": "Plain (Volitional)",
      "nuance": "This simple sentence effectively conveys the speaker's helplessness.  The use of 「帰ろう」 (kaerou - volitional form) directly shows the speaker's intent, while 「帰れない」(kaerenai - negative potential) highlights the impossibility."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "行こうにも行けない。",
      "english": "I can't go, even though I want to.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "Plain (Volitional)",
      "nuance": "Similar to the previous example, 「行こう」 (ikou - volitional form) paired with 「行けない」 (ikenai - negative potential) clearly expresses both the will and the inability."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "連絡しようにも、彼の電話番号を忘れてしまったんです。",
      "english": "Even if I wanted to contact him, I forgot his phone number.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": "Polite (Volitional)",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「しようにも」(shiyou nimo) and 「できません」(dekimasen) softens the tone, appropriate for an apologetic setting. The explanation following the main clause provides context."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "食べようにも、お腹がいっぱいで食べられない。",
      "english": "Even if I wanted to eat more, my stomach is full, so I can't.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "conjugation": "Plain (Volitional)",
      "nuance": "The humorous tone comes from the relatable situation of being too full to eat more, despite the desire.  The use of 「食べよう」 (tabeyou - volitional form) adds a playful element."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "もっと話したいけど、もう時間がないから話そうにも話せない。",
      "english": "I'd love to talk more, but I don't have time, so I can't.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": "Plain (Volitional)",
      "nuance": "This conveys a sense of regret. The use of 「話したい」 (hanashitai) expresses a genuine desire to continue the conversation, making the inability even more frustrating."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたとずっと一緒にいたいけど、現実的に無理だから、そうしようにもできないわ。",
      "english": "I want to be with you forever, but realistically it's impossible, so I can't, even if I want to.",
      "register": "intimate",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "conjugation": "Polite (Volitional)",
      "nuance": "The use of  「ずっと一緒にいたい」(zutto issho ni itai) conveys a strong emotional connection, making the inability more poignant. The phrase 「そうしようにもできないわ」(soushiyou ni mo dekinai wa) uses the female-specific ending 「わ」 (wa) adding a touch of femininity."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "君のことが好きすぎて、忘れようにも忘れられないんだ。",
      "english": "I like you so much, I can't forget you, even if I try.",
      "register": "intimate",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": "Plain (Volitional)",
      "nuance": "This is a classic confession of love. The use of 「君」(kimi) is a slightly less formal way to address a person, hinting at an intimate setting. 「忘れようにも忘れられない」(wasureyou ni mo wasurerarenai)  shows the strong, almost involuntary nature of the speaker's feelings."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the context and choice of conjugation subtly alter the emphasis and overall feeling. The addition of explanatory clauses often helps clarify the reason for the inability. The register also adapts to the level of formality desired in the conversation.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "どんなに〜ても",
      "meaning": "No matter how...",
      "kind": "similar expression",
      "nuance": "Unlike にも～ない, which expresses an inability despite desire, どんなに～ても describes something that happens regardless of the degree or extent of something else.  It does not carry the same implication of frustration."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion between \"にも～ない\" and \"どんなに～ても,\" remember that the former focuses on an inability despite desire, highlighting the speaker's will and its futility. The latter introduces a concession or shows a consequence irrespective of degree or extent.  Context is key to distinguishing these two."
