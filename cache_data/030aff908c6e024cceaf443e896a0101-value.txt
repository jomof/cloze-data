    "etymology": "The term 「はず」 originally comes from the verb 「離(は)ずれる」 (hazureru), meaning \"to deviate\" or \"to miss.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate a situation where something is not deviating from what is expected, thus implying a sense of expectation or certainty.",
    "writeup": "「はずだ」 expresses a strong expectation or belief that something is true or will happen. It suggests a high degree of certainty based on reason or evidence, though not absolute proof. It's similar to saying \"should be\" or \"expected to be\" in English.\n\nThe basic meaning of 「はず」 stems from the idea of something being \"in line\" with expectations or plans. It's often used when the speaker has a good reason to believe something is true, but lacks definitive confirmation.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   「はずだ」 is not used for suggestions or advice. It's about expressing expectations or beliefs based on evidence.\n*   The 「だ」 can be omitted, making the statement sound less certain, akin to adding \"probably\" in English.\n*   「はず」 can also be added to the end of sentences to soften the statement, similar to 「多分(たぶん)」 (tabun) or \"probably.\"",
