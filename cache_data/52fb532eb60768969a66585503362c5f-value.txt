    "etymology": "The kanji 「多」 means \"many\" or \"much.\" It combines with the い ending to form an い-adjective, which describes the state of being numerous or abundant. The reading 「おおい」 is the kun'yomi reading of the kanji.",
    "writeup": "「多い・おおい」 means \"many,\" \"a lot of,\" or \"much.\" It's an い-adjective used to describe a large quantity or number of something. It is important to remember that unlike the English \"many,\" 「多い」 cannot be used directly before a noun except in relative clauses. For example, instead of saying \"many books,\" you would describe the state of the books as 「本が多い」, meaning \"there are many books.\"",
