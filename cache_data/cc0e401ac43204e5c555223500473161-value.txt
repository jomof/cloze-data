    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に反して」 is derived from 「反する (hansuru)」, meaning \"to oppose\" or \"go against\". The 「に」 particle indicates the direction or target of this opposition. Thus, 「に反して」 literally means \"in opposition to\" or \"going against\".",
    "writeup": "「に反して」, formed from 「に」 and the て-form of 「反する」 'to oppose' or 'to go against', presents counter opinions or arguments relative to a previous statement. It translates to 'contrary to (A), (B)' or 'going against (A), (B)'. It follows nouns, introducing an opposing or contrasting point. Alternatively, 「に反する」 can directly modify a noun. Unlike 「に対して」, 「に反して」 often highlights discrepancies between predictions and actual outcomes.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   「に反して」 is a formal pattern, common in literature, official documents, and speeches.\n*   It emphasizes a contrast between what is expected or prescribed and what actually occurs.",
