        "Register": "Generally informal.",

        "Function": "Replaces a noun to avoid repetition. Often used in questions and answers."

    "etymology": "The pronoun 「の」 is derived from the possessive particle 「の」. In this context, it takes on an indefinite meaning, referring to 'one' or 'that which belongs to' a certain category defined by the preceding adjective or clause.",
    "writeup": "The pronoun 「の」 functions as a **dependent indefinite pronoun**, meaning it cannot stand alone and must be modified by an adjective or a relative clause. It is primarily used to replace a noun to avoid repetition in a sentence, especially in informal speech. 「の」 is particularly common in questions and answers where the noun is already understood from context. Think of it as a way to say \"one\" or \"the one\" with a specific quality.",
