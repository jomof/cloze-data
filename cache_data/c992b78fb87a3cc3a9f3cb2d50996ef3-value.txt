  "writeup": "I will now explain the fascinating adverbial phrase いずれも.  It's a versatile expression, often used formally, conveying a sense of inclusivity or totality.  While generally translated as 'all' or 'both,' its nuanced meaning depends heavily on context. The core of いずれも lies in いずれ, meaning 'any,' 'how,' 'where,' or 'what,' depending on the context.  The particle も adds an inclusive sense, meaning 'even,' 'also,' or 'too.'  Therefore, a more literal interpretation might be 'whatever,' 'however,' 'wherever,' or 'whichever.'  The key is understanding that いずれ expresses uncertainty or generality, and も broadens the scope to include all possibilities.  This uncertainty is crucial to its usage—it’s not simply about stating facts, but expressing an inclusiveness that embraces various outcomes.   Consider the subtleties—'in any case,' 'regardless,' 'no matter what'—all hint at the underlying uncertainty. Note that いずれ can appear in kanji as 何れ or 孰れ, though 何れ is far more prevalent. The phrase いずれにしても (in any case) is particularly common in everyday speech.  This adds another layer, as this specific phrase doesn't directly relate to the 'all' or 'both' interpretations. Master this subtlety, and your Japanese will flow beautifully.",

  "etymology": "The etymology of いずれも traces back to いずれ (either, whichever, any) and も (also, too, even).  いず‐れ itself has roots in the older word 孰れ (izure), sharing a similar origin with the interrogative pronouns such as 何 (nani, what), どの (dono, which), and どちら (dochira, which).  The combination of いずれ and も creates a phrase that emphasizes a comprehensive consideration of all possibilities within a given set. The use of も clearly differentiates this from other phrases emphasizing a single choice.",
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the nuance of いずれも shifts based on context.  Focus on the inherent uncertainty expressed by いずれ and the all-inclusive nature of も.  The more you utilize this phrase in various contexts, the better you will understand its dynamic application. It's a key to understanding and using polite and formal Japanese."
