    "katakana": "～バコソ",
    "romaji": "~ba koso"
  },
  "writeup": "The grammar point ～ばこそ is used to emphasize the reason for a subsequent event or action.  It translates to \"precisely because,\" \"only because,\" or \"because\" but carries a stronger sense of emphasis than simpler causal conjunctions.  Think of it as highlighting a reason that might seem unexpected or counterintuitive. This construction combines the conditional particle ば (ba) and the emphatic particle こそ (koso).  The particle ば (ba) sets up a hypothetical condition, while こそ (koso) intensifies the causal relationship. The resulting expression is quite formal and carries a somewhat archaic nuance, making からこそ (kara koso) a more common choice in modern Japanese.  Importantly, ～ばこそ often follows a hypothetical condition that's less straightforward than what one might initially assume.  It emphasizes the particular and crucial nature of the reason given.  When used after nouns or na-adjectives, it takes the form であればこそ (de areba koso).",
  "etymology": "The particle ば (ba) originates from the classical conditional verb ending -ば.  こそ (koso) is an emphatic particle, originally indicating a focus or emphasis on a particular item or situation.  The combination creates a formal and emphatic causal relationship.",

However, ～ばこそ adds a level of formality and emphasizes the unexpected nature of the given reason.  Choose ～ばこそ when you need a stronger emphasis and a more formal tone; otherwise, からこそ is generally preferred."
