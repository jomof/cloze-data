    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことなく」 is derived from 「こと」 (koto, 'thing' or 'event') and 「なく」 (naku), which is the adverbial form of 「ない」 (nai, 'not'). Thus, it literally means 'without the thing/event of ~ing'.",
    "writeup": "「ことなく」 is used to express that something is done 'without' doing something else. It is similar to 「ないで」 ('without doing'), but 「ことなく」 is more formal and often implies a contrast between two actions or states. This contrast can manifest in two main ways:\n\n*   Avoiding something negative: 「ことなく」 can indicate that an action (B) was performed to prevent a negative outcome (A), or that (B) was achieved while successfully avoiding (A).\n*   Unmet desire: 「ことなく」 can highlight a situation where a desired outcome (A) did not occur, and instead, something else (B) happened. In this case, (A) is often something that was hoped for but did not materialize.",
