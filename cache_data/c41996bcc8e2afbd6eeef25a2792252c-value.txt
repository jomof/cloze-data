    "writeup": "As mentioned in our 当たり lesson, 当たる often has a meaning that is similar to に対して \"to be in regard to\". Due to this, when combined with the case marking particle に, に当たる will be translated as \"to correspond to\", \"to amount to\", \"to be appropriate for\", or \"to be in regard to\". These may seem quite different, but we will examine the similarities shortly.\n\nTo use に当たる, attach it to the end of an (A) noun that you would like to mark as being the \"point of reference\". (B) may come directly after に当たる, or earlier in the sentence, so long as it is clearly separated from (A).\n\nAs for the link between に対して and に当たる, it is as follows. In に対して, (A) and (B) exist simultaneously, but (B) opposes something about (A). In に当たる, (A) and (B) exist simultaneously, but (B) matches something about (A). Due to this, unless the speaker is specifically trying to highlight something that is \"opposing\", or \"matching\", the base meaning of \"(A) and (B) existing simultaneously\" may be the standard translation.",
