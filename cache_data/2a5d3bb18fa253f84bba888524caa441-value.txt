    "etymology": "The grammar point ものですから is derived from the noun 「もの」 (thing, reason) and the particle 「ですから」 (therefore, because). Therefore, ものですから literally means something along the lines of 「その理由は〜です」 (the reason is ~).",
    "writeup": "「ものですから」 is a stronger, slightly more emphatic version of 「ものだから」, used to explain something or give a reason. Think of it as an extension of 「から」 ('because'), with 「もの」 ('thing') emphasizing what's said before it. It translates to 'because (A)' or 'the reason is (A)'.\n\n*   It follows verbs and い-adjectives directly. For な-adjectives and nouns, add 「な」 before 「ものですから」.\n*   「ものですから」 can be shortened to 「もので」 or 「もんで」 without changing the meaning. 「もので」 implies continuation, even if what follows is omitted because it's obvious.\n*   While slightly more emphatic, 「ものだから」 and 「ものですから」 are largely interchangeable.\n\nImportant Consideration:\n\n*   「ものですから」 often explains actions, emphasizing that situation (A) led to the speaker doing (B).",
