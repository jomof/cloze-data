  "writeup": "The expression さえ～ば combines the adverbial particle さえ and the conditional particle ば.  It highlights a crucial, often minimal, condition necessary for a result to occur.  Think of it as expressing a hypothetical limitation: 'If only (A), then (B)'.  It can also be translated as 'the only thing needed for (A) is (B)' or 'as long as (A), (B)'.  さえ can modify various word types, but verbs require the conjunctive (て) form before it.  It frequently appears after other particles, creating nuanced meanings. This use of さえ illustrates a specific type of limitation, with the hypothetical nature emphasized by ば. While you might encounter さえ with other hypothetical markers (like たら), it's uncommon in modern Japanese; さえ～ば is the established, preferred form.  This conditional limitation is sometimes called a 'stipulation' or 'condition'.",
