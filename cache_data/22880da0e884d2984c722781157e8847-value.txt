    "etymology": "「途中(とちゅう)」 literally means 'on the way' or 'midway'. The addition of 「に」 or 「で」 specifies the context: 「に」 emphasizes the location or time *on the way*, while 「で」 emphasizes the action or process happening *in the middle of* something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「途中に・途中で」 (tochuu ni / tochuu de) uses the word 「途中」, which means \"on the way\". By adding the particle 「に」 or 「で」, you can express being 'on the way to,' 'partway through,' or 'in the middle of' something. 「途中」 can follow a noun and 「の」, or a verb in its dictionary form.\n\n*   「に」 tends to emphasize the time or duration of the activity.\n*   「で」 tends to emphasize the action or process itself.\n\nThe difference between 「に」 and 「で」 can be subtle and overlap. Observing many examples will help you understand the nuance.",
