  "writeup": "The grammar point ～は～となっている (～wa～to natte iru) is a formal expression used to describe a state of being or a situation that has become established.  It's often used to convey a sense of finality or a current, established fact.  While it can sometimes be translated as \"(A) is (B)\", it carries a stronger implication of a process leading to the current state.  Think of it as \"(A) has become (B),\" or \"(A) has been established as (B).\"  This construction is primarily used with nouns and na-adjectives in their stem form.  Let's explore its nuances through examples.",
  "etymology": "The structure combines the topic marker は (wa), the quotative と (to), the verb なる (naru, to become) in its passive/potential form なって (natte), and the copula いる (iru, to be/exist) which is contracted to いる to なっている (natte iru). The passive/potential form of なる emphasizes the result of a process, and いる anchors this result in the present.  This combination creates a formal and somewhat static presentation of a state.",
