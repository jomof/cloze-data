  "etymology": "The grammar point \"を以て\" (wo motte) originates from the classical Japanese phrase structure.  \"以て\" (motte) is derived from the verb \"持つ\" (motsu) meaning \"to hold\" or \"to possess.\" In this grammatical context, it signifies \"by means of\" or \"using.\" The particle \"を\" (wo) marks the object of this action, thus, \"を以て\" specifies the means or instrument used to perform an action. The formality arises from its classical roots and infrequent use in modern casual conversation. This structure can be perceived as an elegant and sophisticated expression of conveying the means or methods utilized in a given scenario.",
  "writeup": "The formal grammar point \"を以て\" (wo motte) translates to \"by means of,\" \"with,\" \"by,\" \"via,\" or \"in view of.\"  It's used similarly to the particle \"で\" but with a more formal and emphatic tone.  Because it's preceded by the particle \"を,\" it directly follows nouns or noun phrases.  It emphasizes the *means* or *instrument* used, rather than simply stating how something is done. Unlike \"で,\" \"を以て\" is not typically used for simple actions like \"going by bus.\" It's more appropriate for emphasizing the method, especially when dealing with abstract concepts like 'sincerity' or 'compassion', rather than concrete tools.  The phrase \"をもってすれば\" (wo motte sureba) is common; it translates to something like \"assuming that it's done with (A)\" or \"granted the use of (A).\"",
