    "etymology": "The etymology of 誰 (dare) is debated, but it is believed to have originated from a combination of sounds indicating uncertainty or questioning. The exact origins are unclear, reflecting the inherent ambiguity of inquiring about an unknown person.",
    "writeup": "誰 (dare) is a pronoun in Japanese used to ask about or refer to unknown people. Its meaning can change depending on the particle that follows it, such as: 誰が (dare ga - who), 誰で (dare de - who), 誰に (dare ni - to whom), 誰を (dare o - whom), 誰の (dare no - whose), 誰か (dare ka - someone), 誰 も (dare mo - anyone/everyone - with a negative verb).  It's a fundamental word for basic communication. Depending on the level of politeness, you might use どなた (donata - more polite) or どちら様 (dochisama - very polite) instead of 誰, especially when addressing superiors or customers.",
