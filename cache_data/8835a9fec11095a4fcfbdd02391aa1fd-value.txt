    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed by combining the negative form of a verb (ない), the particle で, and ください (the polite imperative form of くださる, meaning \"to give\"). Literally, it's asking someone to 'give' the action of 'not doing' something.",
    "writeup": "`ないでください` is used to politely request that someone refrains from doing something. It combines the `ない` form of a verb (negative), the particle `で`, and `ください` (the imperative form of くださる). `ください` is classified as honorific language, which is a type of polite speech used to show respect. While `ください` is the polite form of `くれる`, be cautious, as `ないでくれ` is too casual for most situations.",
