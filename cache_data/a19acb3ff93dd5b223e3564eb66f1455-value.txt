    "writeup": "The adverb **ずっと** has the primary meaning of indicating that something continues in a constant state without stopping. It emphasizes the duration of an action or state. You can place **ずっと** at the beginning of the phrase you want to emphasize as ongoing. Alternatively, using **ずっと** after **から** expresses that something has been continuing 'ever since' a specific point in time.  It literally conveys a sense of being 'unwavering' or 'unfaltering', often implying the maximum extent or duration of something.",
