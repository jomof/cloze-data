    "etymology": "「から」 indicates a starting point or source, 「する」 acts as a verb meaning \"to do\" or \"to consider\" in this context, and 「と」 or 「ば」 creates a conditional or hypothetical nuance. Therefore, the phrase literally means \"if we were to do (consider) from (a certain point).\"",
    "writeup": "「からすると」 and 「からすれば」 are expressions used to indicate that a judgment or conclusion is based on something. They combine the particle 「から」 (from), the verb 「する」 (to do), and the conditional markers 「と」 or 「ば」. It's similar to saying \"judging from (A), (B)\" or \"considering (A), (B)\". The 「する」 here signifies the act of considering or basing a judgment on the preceding noun. In essence, 「からすると」/「からすれば」 highlights the speaker's assessment based on the given information.",
