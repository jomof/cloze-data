    "etymology": "The verb 「兼 (か)ねる」 means \"to combine,\" \"to do two things at once,\" or \"to serve two purposes.\" When used as a suffix, it implies that doing something is difficult because it interferes with another obligation or conflicts with one's desires.",
    "writeup": "「かねる」, usually written in kana, attaches to the ます-stem of a verb and indicates that it is **difficult, impossible, or one is hesitant to do something**, often due to external circumstances or conflicting desires. Though 「できない」 can also mean "cannot", 「かねる」 is more formal and implies a sense of regret or reluctance. 「かねる」 is similar to saying something would be \"a stretch\" in English.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to differentiating 「かねる」 from similar expressions lies in understanding the nuance of reluctance and difficulty it conveys. While other phrases may express inability or impossibility, 「かねる」 subtly suggests a desire or willingness that is overridden by circumstance. The important thing to remember about 「かねる」 is that it expresses reluctance, and that it is a formal construction. Pay attention to the surrounding context to understand the underlying reasons behind the inability and the degree of formality required."
