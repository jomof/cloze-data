    "etymology": "The auxiliary verb 「られる」 has roots in older forms of Japanese. It evolved from 「る」, which was initially used for potential and spontaneous verbs. Over time, 「られる」 developed to express the passive voice, indicating that the subject is receiving an action, rather than performing it. In honorific speech, 「られる」 can also express respect for the person performing the action.",
    "writeup": "「られる」 is a versatile auxiliary verb with several functions, most notably the passive voice. It indicates that the subject of the sentence is receiving an action, often against their will or without their control. This contrasts with the active voice, where the subject performs the action.  Passive constructions with 「られる」 can express: \n\n*   **Direct passive:** Similar to English passive sentences, where an active sentence is transformed to focus on the recipient of the action. Example: 本が出版**される** (a book is published).\n*   **Indirect passive:** Indicates that the subject is negatively affected by someone else's action. Example: ケーキを食べ**られた** (my cake was eaten -- and I was unhappy!).  In these cases, the person performing the action is marked with 「に」. Note that the nuance implies some degree of distress or inconvenience on the part of the subject. \n*   **Honorific:** 「られる」 can be used to show respect to the person performing the action. Example: 田中先生は日本へ帰**られた** (Professor Tanaka returned to Japan—honorific).",

            "etymology": "「建てる」 is N4 kanji. 「建てられた」 is the passive form in the past tense. This example shows a straightforward use of the passive voice, focusing on the building rather than who built it.",
