    "etymology": "The 「て」 form here originates from the conjunctive particle 「て」, similar to its use with verbs. For な-adjectives, 「で」 is used, which is a conjugated form of 「だ」 (である).",
    "writeup": "The 「て」 form of an い-adjective, or 「で」 form of a な-adjective (or noun), functions similarly to the 「て」 form of a verb, linking clauses or phrases. It carries the meaning of \"and\" and can also indicate a reason or manner.\n\nInstead of linking adjectives directly, 「Adjective + て/で + (B)」 links an adjective to an entire phrase. The phrase following 「て」 (for い-adjectives) or 「で」 (for な-adjectives and nouns) is treated as an independent sentence.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   Like verb 「て」 forms, adjective 「て」 forms have multiple meanings:\n    *   Linking: Similar to \"and\" in English.\n    *   Reasons: Similar to \"with (A)\" or \"because of (A)\" in English.\n    *   Manner: Similar to \"to do (B) in an (A) way\" in English.\n\n*   As with conjugations of 「いい」, the 「て」 form is 「よくて」, not 「いくて」.",
