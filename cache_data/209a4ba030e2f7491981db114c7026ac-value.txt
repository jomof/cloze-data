  "writeup": "This grammar point explains how い-adjectives modify nouns in Japanese.  Unlike English, where adjectives can change form depending on the noun's number (singular/plural), Japanese い-adjectives remain unchanged. They simply precede the noun they modify.  The key is identifying an い-adjective.  A true い-adjective will always have the い morpheme *outside* any kanji components.  For example, 面白い (omoshiroi, interesting) is clearly an い-adjective because the い is outside the kanji.  However, there are exceptions.  While generally true, a word with い at the end, written outside of kanji, is not always an い-adjective.  For instance, 嫌い (kirai, hate) is a な-adjective, despite its apparent resemblance to an い-adjective. This exception is fairly rare, so don't let it overly complicate your understanding. The vast majority of words with this structure will indeed be い-adjectives.",
  "etymology": "The structure of い-adjective + noun is a fundamental aspect of Japanese sentence structure, reflecting the head-final nature of the language. The い-adjective functions as a modifier, adding descriptive information to the noun that follows.  The suffix -い itself is an ancient grammatical marker, whose origins predate recorded Japanese. Its evolution is closely tied to the development of adjectival forms in the language.",

      "nuance": "This sentence uses the plain form of the い-adjective 新しい (atarashii), making it suitable for general informative conversation.  The です (desu) adds politeness."

      "japanese": "可愛い猫ですね。",
      "english": "That's a cute cat, isn't it?",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The ね (ne) softens the statement, while the です (desu) is polite and suitable for most situations."

      "english": "That car is old.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The よ (yo) is a casual sentence-ending particle.  This sentence is appropriate for casual conversation among friends."

    {
      "japanese": "素敵なレストランだね。",
      "english": "It's a wonderful restaurant.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The ね (ne) makes it a softer statement, while だ (da) marks the casual register suitable between close friends or family."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼はイケメンだ！",
      "english": "He's a handsome guy!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The exclamation point and だ (da) mark the casual and excited tone, suitable for expressing admiration amongst close friends. 「イケメン」 (ikemen) itself is slang, which further emphasizes informality."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "貴方は美しいですね。",
      "english": "You are beautiful.",
      "register": "polite",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 貴方 (anata) and ね (ne) alongside です (desu) creates a polite but still subtly flirty tone.  The choice of 「美しい」(utsukushii) is more formal than 「きれい」(kirei) which makes it appropriate for a more mature and refined context, as opposed to a situation where the speakers are on a first-name basis."

    {
      "japanese": "あなたと一緒なら、どんな辛い日も楽しいです。",
      "english": "With you, even the toughest days are fun.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The polite 「です」(desu) combined with the romantic sentiment makes it suitable for expressing deeper feelings in a first encounter or early dating stage.  The use of  「あなた」(anata) is polite and avoids the intimacy of a name."
    }

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while the basic structure is simple, the nuance and register can change drastically based on the choice of sentence-ending particles and the overall context.  Practice varying these to master natural-sounding Japanese."
