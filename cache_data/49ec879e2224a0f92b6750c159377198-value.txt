    "etymology": "The noun 「こと」 means \"thing\" or \"matter.\" In this grammatical structure, it functions as an auxiliary noun to create a sense of obligation or instruction. The construction 「Verb + こと」 transforms the verb into a command or requirement. Adding 「ない」 before 「こと」 creates a negative command, prohibiting the action.",
    "writeup": "The 「こと」 imperative is used to express commands, rules, or instructions. It is primarily found in formal writing and speech, such as in public notices, signs, and official documents. It is less common in everyday conversation. To express a prohibition, use the negative form 「ないこと」. This grammar point carries a sense of authority and is often used when conveying important information that must be followed. Note that 「Verb + こと」 means \"you must do X\", while 「Verb + ないこと」 means \"you must not do X\".",
