  "writeup": "The phrase というより (to iu yori) is a nuanced comparative expression used to suggest a more accurate or fitting description than the one initially presented.  It literally translates to \"rather than saying...,\" but its function is more subtle.  It implies a reconsideration or refinement of the first statement, highlighting a more appropriate alternative.  This construction combines the quotative と (to) with the verb 言う (iu, 'to say'), and the comparative particle より (yori, 'than').  While it can follow various word types, nouns and na-adjectives often require the copula だ (da) for grammatical correctness, although this is frequently omitted in casual speech. Importantly,  より always emphasizes the 'lesser' element in comparison, meaning the second part of the sentence always presents something considered 'more' accurate, appropriate, or closer to the truth. This is a key distinction that avoids misinterpretations.",
  "etymology": "The etymology is straightforward.  It's a combination of three core elements: と (to), a quotative particle indicating a quoted statement; いう (iu), the verb 'to say'; and より (yori), a particle indicating comparison. The combination directly reflects the meaning of 'rather than saying...'.",
