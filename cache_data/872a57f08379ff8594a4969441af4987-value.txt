    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 in this context indicates the agent or source of an action, often translated as \"by\" or \"from.\" It's frequently used in passive sentences, causative sentences, and with verbs of receiving or learning (e.g., 「もらう」, 「習う」). It's crucial to understand that 「に」 specifies *who* is performing the action that affects someone or something else. This usage helps to clarify roles and responsibilities in the sentence.",
