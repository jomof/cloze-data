  "writeup": "The Japanese expression て初めて highlights a verb as the catalyst for a specific result or state.  It literally translates to 'with (A) done, for the first time (B)'. This often equates to 'only after I (A) did I (B)' or 'not until (A) did I (B)'.  It's important to note that the (A) verb isn't necessarily performed for the very first time; rather, *this particular instance* of (A) leads to the first experience of (B).  The nuance lies in the causal relationship between the two actions.  Initially, both 始めて ('commencing with') and 初めて ('starting with') were used, but modern Japanese usage strictly prefers 初めて to convey 'for the first time'.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of て初めて lies in the combination of the て-form of a verb (indicating completion or a preceding action) and 初めて (hajimete), meaning 'for the first time'.  The て-form provides the context of a preceding action, while 初めて emphasizes the novelty of the resulting state or action. The combination elegantly expresses the causal relationship and the timing of the first experience.",
