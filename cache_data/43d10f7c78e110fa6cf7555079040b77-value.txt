    "meaning": "Not necessarily so, Is not always true, There is no guarantee that",
    "etymology": "The expression とは限らない combines the quotative particle と, the topic marker は, and the negative form of the verb 限る (かぎる), which means \"to limit\".  Therefore, it literally translates to \"as for that (topic), it is not limited,\" implying that the stated idea is not the only possibility or not always true.",

    "writeup": "とは限らない is used to express that something is **not necessarily true** or that there is **no guarantee** of a particular outcome.  It combines the particle と, indicating a topic or quote, the topic marker は, and the negated form of the verb 限る (かぎる), meaning \"to limit\". It can be used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns.  When used with な-adjectives and nouns, the copula だ is required before とは限らない.  The literal sense is that something is \"not limited\" to being the case.",

            "nuance": "The use of 「からといって」 indicates that the preceding statement is a reason that one might *assume* something, but 「とは限らない」 clarifies that this assumption is not always correct. This sentence uses relatively common vocabulary suitable for everyday conversation."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While several expressions share a similar meaning of expressing uncertainty or negating a guarantee, they have slightly different nuances. 「限り」 expresses a definite limit or condition, contrasting with the uncertainty of 「とは限らない」. Expressions like 「ことにはならない」, 「というものでもない」, 「というわけではない」, and 「わけではない」 are used to refute assumptions or implications, often with a slightly stronger or more corrective tone than 「とは限らない」. 「必ずしも」 functions as an adverb with a similar meaning. 「ないことはない」 indicates possibility rather than uncertainty. Pay attention to the specific context and the degree of certainty or denial you want to convey when choosing between these expressions."
