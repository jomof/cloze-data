    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てから」 is formed by combining the 「て」 form of a verb with the particle 「から」. The 「て」 form connects actions in a sequence, and 「から」 indicates 'from' or 'after'. Together, they express that something happens *after* the completion of the action described by the verb in 「て」 form. So, literally, 'from the state of having done'.",
    "writeup": "「てから」 is used to express that one action happens after another is completed. It emphasizes the sequential relationship between the two actions, meaning action A enables or precedes action B. It is commonly translated as \"after doing A, B\" or \"once A happens, B\". It's **important** to note the emphasis on sequence and completion, differentiating it from simply using the 「て」 form to link events.",

            "nuance": "Simple statement of intent to do dishes after eating. 「食べてから」 shows the sequential order explicitly."
