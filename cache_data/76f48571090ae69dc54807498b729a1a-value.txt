    "writeup": "「とあっては」 is used to present a situation as a reason or condition, implying that the following outcome is a natural or unavoidable consequence. It often carries a sense of acceptance or resignation, suggesting that there is little one can do to change the situation. It's similar to saying \"given that...\" or \"if it's the case that...\" in English. It's a more formal expression. It suggests that a certain outcome is unavoidable or understandable given the preceding situation.\n\n*   It's often used when discussing circumstances that are beyond one's control.\n*   The phrase implies a logical connection between the stated condition and the subsequent result.\n*   「とあっては」 is more formal than expressions like 「から」 or 「ので」.",
