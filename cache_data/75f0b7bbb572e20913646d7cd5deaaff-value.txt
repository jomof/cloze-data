  "writeup": "The noun 後 \"behind\" commonly indicates a remainder or everything following a specific point.  It translates as 'what's left of (A)', 'the rest of (A)', 'what's remaining of (A)', or even 'other than (A)'.  Observe how 後 combines with the particle の before nouns, precedes numbers directly, or initiates entire phrases.  Despite varied translations, 後 fundamentally identifies a sequence and what comes 'after' or 'behind' a particular point within that sequence. This usage is standard across registers and demographics, making it a versatile grammatical element.",
  "etymology": "The word 後 derives from the ancient word for 'behind' or 'later'. Its evolution reflects a consistent association with what follows or remains after a preceding event or object. The modern use retains this core meaning, but it has expanded semantically to encompass various aspects of remainder or what is left.",
  "examples": [

      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The politeness of the request, indicated by 「ください」 and 「お願いします」, suits a formal setting like instructing someone in a workplace or a household chore. The sentence structure is straightforward and clear."

      "japanese": "映画公開まで**後**３日！",
      "english": "**Three** days until the movie release!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The exclamation point and concise phrasing suggest excitement and a casual register, typical in informal conversations amongst friends. 「後」 is used before a number directly, showing its ability to quantify a remaining timeframe."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "子供がお隣さんと話している：「うちでは７匹動物を飼ってるんです。猫が５匹、**後の**２匹は犬です。」",
      "english": "A child tells a neighbor: 'We have 7 animals. Five are cats, and the **other** two are dogs.'",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses casual speech features, 「んです」 being one example. This suits the setting of children casually chatting with neighbors. The usage of 後 here clearly specifies the remaining animals after specifying the first group. 「後の」 functions as 'the rest of' the animals."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "砂漠で独り言を言う：「ガソリンが**後**７リットルしかない。足りるかな？」",
      "english": "A person alone in the desert thinks: 'Only 7 liters of gas left. Will it be enough?'",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a casual internal monologue, indicated by the lack of formal grammar and the use of 「かな？」.  The direct placement of 後 before the number is perfectly natural. The sentence highlights the use of 後 to denote a limited remaining quantity."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "妻は夫と話している：「**後**少ししか砂糖がないから、コンビニに買いに行ってくれない？」",
      "english": "A wife asks her husband: 'There's only a little sugar left, so can you buy some at the convenience store?'",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "intimate",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence's tone is intimate due to the context of a married couple's conversation.  The use of 「くれない？」 adds a softer, more pleading tone. Here 後 expresses a small remaining amount. It is followed by the quantifier, 「少し」."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ヨーロッパを除いて、**後の**世界は全てあなた方のものだ。",
      "english": "Excluding Europe, the **rest** of the world is yours.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal tone is apparent in the declarative sentence structure and the absence of colloquialisms.  This suits a serious setting, such as a formal announcement or declaration.  後の here is used to delineate the remaining part of a whole, in this case, the rest of the world after Europe is excluded."

        {
      "japanese": "ねえ、あなたと過ごす時間は、**後の**人生の思い出になると思う？",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「ねえ」 and the question 「と思う？」 create a flirty tone in this sentence.  This is a common way a young woman might flirt with a man she is interested in. The use of 後の here subtly implies that the speaker is thinking about a long future and is hoping for that future to include the listener.  The phrase 「後の時間」 is used to suggest a lot of time spent together in the future."
