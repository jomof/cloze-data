    "etymology": "「ように」 is derived from the noun 「様 (よう)」, meaning 'manner,' 'way,' or 'appearance.' It evolved to function as an adverbial particle to indicate similarity or resemblance. It can also indicate purpose but this entry is about similarity in appearance or action.",
    "writeup": "「ように」indicates similarity or resemblance, functioning as 'like,' 'as,' or 'as if.' It describes how something is or how something is done by drawing a comparison to something else. The nuance of 「ように」 is often descriptive, painting a picture of how something resembles something else, either in action, appearance, or manner. For verbs and i-adjectives, use the dictionary form directly before 「ように」. For na-adjectives, use the stem + 「な」. For nouns, add 「の」 before 「ように」.",
