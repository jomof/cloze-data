  "writeup": "The adverbial phrase \"あくまでも\" (akumademo) means \"to the bitter end,\" \"stubbornly,\" or \"persistently.\"  It emphasizes the unwavering continuation of an action or stance, regardless of obstacles or consequences.  It's derived from the verb \"飽く\" (あく, aku), an older form of \"飽きる\" (あくきる, akiru), meaning \"to tire of\" or \"to get fed up with.\"  Combined with \"まで\" (made, until) and \"も\" (mo, even), it paints a picture of relentless pursuit.  While \"も\" adds emphasis and is commonly included, \"あくまでも\" can sometimes appear as \"あくまで\" (akumade). The phrase usually appears at the sentence's beginning, setting the stage for the described persistent action. Often paired with words expressing intention, like \"つもり\" (tsumori, intention), it highlights determination despite potential negative outcomes. Although composed of \"飽く\" and \"まで,\" modern Japanese dictionaries list it as an independent adverbial expression.",
  "etymology": "The core of the phrase, \"あく\" (aku), comes from the older, more literary form of the verb \"飽きる\" (akiru), meaning 'to be sated,' 'to be tired of,' or 'to be fed up with.' The addition of \"まで\" (made, until) and \"も\" (mo, even) intensifies the meaning to express stubborn persistence.",
