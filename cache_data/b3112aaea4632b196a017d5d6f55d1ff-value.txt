    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を限りに」 combines the particle 「を」 (marking the limit), the noun 「限り」 (limit, boundary), and the particle 「に」 (indicating location or time). The combination creates a phrase that sets a specific limit or endpoint.",
    "writeup": "「を限りに」 is a structure that follows nouns, typically indicating a time or place, to express a termination point for something that has been continuing. Common interpretations include \"ending with (A), (B)\" and \"no longer than (A), (B).\" It signals that something will cease or change at the specified point. This grammar pattern utilizes the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「限り」 ('limit'), and the case-marking particle 「に」. 「を限りに」 is often used for making formal proclamations or announcements, lending it a more formal tone than similar structures like 「限りで」. \n\n**Important Note:** While 「を限りに」 usually follows words denoting a specific time or place viewed temporally, the set expression 「声を限りに」, meaning 'to the limit of one's voice,' is an exception to this rule.",
