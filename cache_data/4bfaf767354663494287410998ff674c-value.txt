    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ては」 is a combination of the 「て」 form of a verb (or the 「で」 form for nouns and na-adjectives) and the particle 「は」. 「て」 (or 「で」) indicates a connection or sequence, and 「は」 adds a sense of contrast or topic marking, often implying a negative consequence or undesirable outcome.",
    "writeup": "The 「ては」 grammar structure is used to express that if a certain action or state continues, it will lead to a negative or undesirable result. It can be translated as \"if,\" \"when,\" \"since,\" or \"because,\" depending on the context. Often it carries a sense of warning or negative expectation. Sometimes 「ては」 is shortened to 「じゃ」 or 「ちゃ」 in casual speech. 「では」 is used after nouns and na-adjectives, rather than 「ては」.",
