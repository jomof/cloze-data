    "etymology": "「契機 (けいき)」 refers to a chance, an opportunity, or a trigger for something to happen. The particle 「を」 marks the noun as the direct object of an implied verb of action or consideration, and 「に」 indicates the resulting state or consequence.  Essentially, it means \"making (something) the trigger/opportunity, leading to...\".",
    "writeup": "「を契機に」 is a formal grammatical construction indicating that a particular event or situation serves as a **trigger** or **pivotal moment**, leading to a subsequent action or change.  It often carries a sense of significance or importance in the event that acts as the catalyst.  Think of it as a turning point. This construction is considered formal and is typically used in more serious or official contexts, such as news reports, academic writing, or business communications.  It is often used when discussing significant personal events or major social or historical shifts.  While it can be used for both positive and negative events, the triggering event is generally substantial.  Alternatives like 「にして」 or 「として」 can replace 「に」 without altering the core meaning.  It's **important** to distinguish this from 「をきっかけに」.  While both indicate a trigger, 「を契機に」 emphasizes a more critical juncture or a more significant cause, making 「をきっかけに」 more suitable for everyday, less impactful triggers.",
