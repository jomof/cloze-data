    "etymology": "並み is the noun form of the classical verb 並む (narabu), which shares the same meaning as the modern verb 並ぶ (narabu), meaning \"to line up\" or \"to be in line.\"",
    "writeup": "並み (nami) is used to indicate that something is \"on par with,\" \"worthy of,\" \"like,\" or \"equivalent to\" something else. It's often used to express that something reaches a certain standard or level. It can be attached directly to nouns to describe something that is comparable to the noun.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   When used as a standalone noun (並), followed by the particle の (no), it refers to the \"average\" or \"ordinary\" level of something.\n*   並み is best used when the noun it's compared to has a well-recognized or easily identifiable standard. If the \"norm\" is subjective or based on personal opinion, using 並み might sound unnatural.",
