    "writeup": "「好きだ・すきだ」 is a *na*-adjective used to express liking or fondness for something or someone. The basic structure involves the \"は~が construction,\" where the person experiencing the liking is marked by 「は」, and the object of their affection is marked by 「が」. It's crucial to remember that the object of liking takes 「が」, not 「を」.\n\n*Important Considerations*:\n*   「大好き」 (daisuki) means \"love\" or \"like very much,\" intensifying the feeling.\n*   「好き」 can also combine with nouns to describe someone who likes doing something (e.g., 「音楽好き」 - someone who likes music).\n*   The antonym of 「好きだ」 is 「嫌いだ」 (kirai da), which means \"to dislike\" or \"to hate.\"",
