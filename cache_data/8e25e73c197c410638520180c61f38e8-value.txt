    "etymology": "The grammar point 「お〜になる」 is derived from the polite prefix 「お」 or 「ご」, which adds a layer of respect, combined with the verb 「なる」 (to become). The prefix 「お」 is generally used with native Japanese words (kun-yomi), while 「ご」 is used with Sino-Japanese words (on-yomi). By using 「お／ご」 with the ます-stem of a verb followed by 「になる」, the speaker elevates the action being described, showing deference to the person performing the action. It's a more indirect and thus polite way of expressing someone's actions or state.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「お〜になる」 (or 「ご〜になる」) is a *keigo* (honorific language) construct used to show respect for the actions of someone you're speaking to, or another person of higher status. Importantly, it's **never used** when talking about your own actions.  Essentially, 「になる」 functions similarly to 「する」 (to do), but it attaches to the ます-stem of a verb to create a respectful nuance.\n\nThe difference between 「お」 and 「ご」 lies in the origin of the verb. 「お」 is used with words of Japanese origin (*kun-yomi*), while 「ご」 is used with words of Chinese origin (*on-yomi*).\n\nFor example, some verbs, like 「おいでになる」, are almost exclusively used in honorific contexts. 「おいでになる」, the 「お〜になる」 form of 「いる・来る・行く」, can mean 'to come,' 'to go,' or 'to be,' reflecting the speaker's respectful perspective.",
