    "etymology": "のに is derived from the particle の, which nominalizes the preceding verb, and the particle に, which indicates direction or purpose. Together, they create a phrase meaning \"for the purpose of doing [verb].\"",
    "writeup": "のに functions as a conjunction particle, combining the particles の and に. While it can also express unexpected outcomes (""despite""), here we focus on its use to indicate purpose: ""in order to"". To use のに, attach it to the dictionary form (non-past) of a verb, followed by the condition or action that results from that purpose. Think of it as establishing a goal (the verb + のに) and then stating what's needed or happens to achieve it.",
