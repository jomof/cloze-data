    "etymology": "The adverb 「別に」 normally means \"separately\" or \"individually.\" When used with a negative verb (〜ない), it shifts to mean \"not particularly\" or \"not especially.\" The etymology implies that whatever follows 「別に」 isn't a distinct or special case. It is often used as a softer way of disagreeing or expressing indifference.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「別に」, meaning \"separately,\" takes on a nuanced meaning when paired with a negative verb (ない). Instead of \"separately,\" it expresses that something is \"not particularly\" or \"not especially\" the case. Think of it as a way to downplay something or express a lack of strong feelings. It's similar to saying \"not really\" or \"it's not like...\" in English.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「別に」 often appears with 「わけではない」 because both express uncertainty or a lack of definiteness. However, it should never be paired with 「わけがない」, as this would create a contradiction between uncertainty and certainty.",
