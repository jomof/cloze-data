    "etymology": "The grammar point 「でしかない」 combines the conjunctive form 「で」 of the copula 「だ」, the particle 「しか」 which indicates limitation, and the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」.  Essentially, it means that something is limited to being just that and nothing more.",
    "writeup": "「でしかない」 is a construction that signifies that something is **merely** or **nothing but** what is being stated.  It follows directly after a noun. The 「で」 comes from the conjunctive form of the copula 「だ」. 「しか」 is a particle indicating limitation, and 「ない」 negates the possibility of anything else. While it can be used neutrally, it often carries a nuance of something being insignificant or lacking value beyond what it is.",
