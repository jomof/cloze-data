  "etymology": "全然 (ぜんぜん) is formed from the kanji 全 (ぜん, zen) meaning \"all\" or \"whole,\" repeated for emphasis. This repetition intensifies the meaning to convey a complete or total negation.",
  "writeup": "The adverb 全然 (ぜんぜん) is traditionally used with negative expressions to mean \"not at all.\" For instance, 「全然ない」 means \"not at all.\" While it's grammatically expected to be used with negative forms, it's increasingly common, especially among younger speakers, to find it with positive statements, meaning \"totally\" or \"completely.\" In writing, both hiragana (ぜんぜん) and kanji (全然) are acceptable. Be aware that 全く (まったく), a similar expression, can sound more formal and sometimes carries a negative nuance, depending on tone.",
