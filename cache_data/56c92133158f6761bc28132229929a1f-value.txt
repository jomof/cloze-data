    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「～ても～ても」, is used to express that no matter how much or how many times something is done, the result remains the same or is not as expected. It emphasizes the repetition and often carries a sense of frustration or futility. It can be used with verbs and adjectives, and the verb or adjective is repeated in the 「て」 (te) form followed by 「も」 (mo). For adjectives, i-adjectives become 「〜くて」 (~kute) + 「も」 (mo), and na-adjectives become 「〜で」 (~de) + 「も」 (mo).",
