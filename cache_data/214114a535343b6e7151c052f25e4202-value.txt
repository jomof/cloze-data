  "writeup": "The grammar point とものだ is a forceful expression conveying the speaker's strong impression or conclusion about something.  It's often translated as \"that's just how it is,\" \"that's the way things are,\" or \"it's simply a matter of...,\" but the nuance is stronger, implying a certain level of authority or conviction in the speaker's assessment.  The structure combines という (meaning 'that which is said,' or simply 'that'), 物 (mono - thing), and だ (a copula indicating a statement of fact).  It's typically found at the end of a clause, summarizing a preceding statement with the speaker's definitive judgment. While it can be used neutrally, its directness often lends itself to critical statements.  In casual speech, という is frequently shortened to って, without altering the meaning.",
  "etymology": "The etymology is straightforward.  It's a combination of three common elements: という (a quoting particle derived from the verb 言う - to say), 物 (mono - thing, an extremely common noun), and だ (the copula, a crucial part of many Japanese sentence structures). The combination creates a concise yet emphatic way to state a conclusion or observation.",
