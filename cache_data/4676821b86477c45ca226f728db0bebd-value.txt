  "writeup": "ぞ is a sentence-ending particle used for emphatic statements, similar to よ, but significantly stronger and primarily employed by men. While よ might simply state a fact, ぞ forcefully highlights something, often translatable as an exclamation point.  It can follow verbs, adjectives, and auxiliary verbs, often expressing the speaker's self-encouragement or conviction rather than direct address.  While uncommon, ぞ can also function as an adverbial particle, similar to は, but with heightened emphasis on the topic. This adverbial use can also follow question words like どこ (where), 誰 (who), なに (what), further intensifying the emphasis.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of ぞ is complex and not fully understood. It's likely derived from an older form of the copula, possibly related to the modern particleぞ, implying a connection to the demonstrative pronoun and the focus particle. Further research is needed to fully trace its origins.",
