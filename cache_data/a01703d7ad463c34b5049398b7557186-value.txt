    "etymology": "The phrase 「なくてはいけない」 is derived from the negative form of a verb (ない), followed by the conjunctive particle 「て」, the particle 「は」, and the expression 「いけない」, meaning 'cannot go' or 'is not allowed.' The literal sense of \"must not not do\" expresses a strong sense of necessity.",
    "writeup": "「なくてはいけない」 expresses a strong sense of obligation or necessity. It's commonly translated as \"must do\" or \"have to do.\" The phrase is formed by taking the negative form of a verb (ない form), changing the 「ない」 to 「なく」, adding 「ては」, and finishing with 「いけない」.\n\n「いけない」 itself means \"cannot go\" and is derived from the negative potential form of the verb 「行く」 (to go). It is the most common structure used with the 'must' and 'must not' grammar points and is considered natural in both speech and written Japanese.\n\nIn casual speech, 「ては」 is often contracted to 「ちゃ」, making the phrase 「なくちゃいけない」. The 「いけない」 can also be omitted without changing the meaning. So you can say 「なくちゃ」. These casual forms are similar to \"gotta\" in English.\n\nAnother alternative is 「ならない」 which may be used in formal speech, but is better suited for writing.\n",
