    "etymology": "との is a compound particle composed of the quotation marker と and the case-marking particle の. と indicates that the preceding part is being quoted or referred to, and の turns the entire quoted phrase into a noun modifier.",
    "writeup": "との is a compound particle made up of the case-marking particle と in its quotation use, and the case-marking particle の. Effectively, this marks the previous statement as a quote, before の then indicates that the whole statement is an attribute of the following word. In many cases, this will simply be translated as “that” or “to”. As always with the quotation use of と, it will appear after almost any word and may or may not be separated from nouns and な-Adjectives with だ.\n\nThis expression indicates that the preceding information is information of some type and will therefore usually be followed by a noun that highlights what type of communication it was. Common examples include 提案 ‘proposal’, 知らせ ‘notice’, 意向 ‘inclination’, 依頼 ‘request’, 見方 ‘point of view’, 指摘 ‘pointing out’, 報告 ‘report’, etc.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   だ after nouns and な-adjectives can often be omitted, leading to constructions like 「危険との意見」 (an opinion that something/someone is dangerous).",
