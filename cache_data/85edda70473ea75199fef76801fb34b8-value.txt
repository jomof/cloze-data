  "writeup": "The verb 関わる (かかわる, to be concerned with), when used with the particle に, expresses a relationship between two things.  This structure, typically seen in its non-kanji form にかかわる, modifies a noun and indicates a connection or relevance.  Think of it as \"concerning X, Y\" or \"X that relates to Y.\"  It's often used to indicate something important, sometimes highlighting a potential negative consequence.  For instance,  a phrase like \"人生にかかわる\" (jinsei ni kakawaru) stresses the serious impact on one's life. While similar to に関する (ni kansuru), にかかわる implies a more profound and impactful connection.",

The other terms provide alternative ways to express relations without this strong implication."
