    "etymology": "The verb 「直(なお)す」 itself means 「to fix」 or 「to repair」. When attached to the stem of another verb, it carries the nuance of doing that action again, often with the implication that the first attempt was not satisfactory.",
    "writeup": "「直(なお)す」 is a verb that fundamentally means \"to fix\" or \"to repair\". However, when attached to the ます-stem of another verb, it takes on the meaning of \"to do over\" or \"to redo\" something. This implies that the action is being repeated, often because the initial attempt was unsatisfactory or incomplete.\n\n*   For regular verbs, simply attach 「直(なお)す」 to the ます-stem.\n*   For 「する」 verbs, the conjugation is slightly different. 「する」 becomes 「し」, and then 「直(なお)す」 is added: 「～し直(なお)す」. In very casual speech, 「する」 might be replaced with 「やる」, resulting in 「～やり直(なお)す」. Since 「やる」 is a う-verb, it conjugates regularly.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\nBe careful not to confuse 「直(なお)す」 (to fix/redo) with 「治(なお)す」 (to heal/cure). The kanji 「直」 literally means \"straight\" or \"direct,\" suggesting the idea of \"straightening out\" something.",
