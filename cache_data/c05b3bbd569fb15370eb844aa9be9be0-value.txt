  "writeup": "The phrase ～ようと思う (yō to omou) or ～おうと思う (ō to omou) combines the volitional form of a verb with the verb 思う (omou, to think).  This creates an expression conveying intention or a plan.  It's often translated as \"I think I will...,\" \"I intend to...,\" or even the more casual \"I'm gonna...\"  The nuance differs slightly from simply stating a future action; it emphasizes the speaker's internal decision-making process.  The choice between よう and おう depends on the verb's final sound;  よう is used after verbs ending in sounds other than う, while おう is used after verbs ending in う.  While generally versatile, this construction is less formal than alternative ways to express intentions. Using  思っている (omotte iru) with this adds a sense that the intention is ongoing or has been considered for some time.",
