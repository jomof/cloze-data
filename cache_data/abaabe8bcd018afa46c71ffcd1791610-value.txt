    "etymology": "「こととて」is derived from 「事」 (koto, meaning 'thing' or 'matter') combined with the particle 「とて」, which indicates reason or cause. 「とて」 itself is an older particle, possibly from 「と」 (to, a case-marking particle) and 「て」 (te, a conjunctive particle) or from the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「たり」 (tari) plus 「て」.",
    "writeup": "「こととて」 is a formal expression used to present a reason or justification, often with an apologetic tone. It is similar to \"due to\" or \"because of\" but carries a more refined and somewhat old-fashioned nuance. Primarily used in writing, it's attached to a noun followed by 「の」 or to the past or negative form of a verb. This grammar point is frequently used when seeking forgiveness or understanding for a situation where the negative outcome is expected or apparent. In modern Japanese, you'll mostly encounter it in formal writing.",
