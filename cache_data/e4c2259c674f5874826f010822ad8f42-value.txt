    "etymology": "The grammar point ませんか is derived from the negative polite form of a verb (ません) combined with the question particle か. It literally asks \"Will you not do...?\", which is used as an invitation.",
    "writeup": "ませんか is a polite expression used to invite someone to do something with you or to make a suggestion. It's similar to asking, \"Won't you do (A) with me?\" or \"Why don't we do (A)?\" While it can be translated as \"Would you not...?\", it functions as an invitation in Japanese.\n\n*   This is considered more polite than ましょうか because it directly asks if the person is willing to join you. \n*   To emphasize that you want to do something together, you can add 一緒に (issho ni - together) to the sentence.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   ませんか is more polite than the casual ないか. Use ませんか unless you're speaking with someone you're very close to. \n*   ましょうか can come across more as a suggestion than an invitation.",
