    "etymology": "The grammar point 「でよければ」 combines the particle 「で」, indicating means or method, and 「よければ」, the conditional (ba-form) of the い-adjective 「良い」(いい - good).  Literally, it translates to \"if it is good with/by (this)\".  The 「で」 here suggests the condition or quality being acceptable.",
    "writeup": "「でよければ」 is used to politely offer something or suggest an option, while checking if it meets the listener's requirements or preferences.  It's a standard expression formed by the particle 「で」 and the conditional form (ば-form) of the い-adjective 「良い」(いい), which is 「よければ」.  The particle 「で」 in this context implies a condition or means.  Thus, 「でよければ」 literally means \"if it is good with/by (this)\".  This grammar point typically follows a noun or noun phrase. It's commonly employed when speaking about oneself, offering help, advice, or a service in a considerate manner. The implication is that the speaker is uncertain if their offer is suitable but is willing to provide it if the listener finds it acceptable.",

The core difference lies in the direction of the condition: 「でよければ」 sets a condition for the offer, while the others react to existing or proposed conditions."
