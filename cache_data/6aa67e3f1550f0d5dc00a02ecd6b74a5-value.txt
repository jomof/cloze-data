  "writeup": "The grammar point \"ところだった ②\" signifies an action that was on the verge of completion or was interrupted.  It translates to \"was just about to do\" or \"was in the middle of.\"  This construction emphasizes the immediacy of the action and often implies a near-miss or a change of events. The nuance shifts depending on context; it can suggest a narrowly avoided negative consequence or a missed opportunity.  Understanding the subtle differences requires attention to the surrounding sentences and particles like \"のに,\" which often follows \"ところだった\" to express a contrasting outcome.  This is a versatile construction frequently used in casual and formal settings.",
  "etymology": "This grammar point combines ところ (tokoro), meaning 'place' or 'point in time,' with the past tense of だ (da), which is だった (datta).  Therefore, literally, it means 'it was at the place (of doing something),' indicating a state of being just about to perform the action.",
