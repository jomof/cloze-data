    "writeup": "「ばよかった」 is a common expression used when someone regrets that something has not been/was not done. It is a combination of the conditional particle 「ば」 and the past tense of the い-adjective 「良い」 (remembering that conjugations of 「いい」 use 「よ」, and not 「い」). This construction is often translated to \"I wish I had (A)\", or \"I should have done (A)\". 「ばよかった」 is used after verbs, requiring the standard 「ば」 conjugation before adding 「よかった」. As 「ば」 highlights hypothetical situations, 「ばよかった」 literally means \"it would have been good if (A)\", where (A) is the action the speaker wishes had occurred.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This grammar point expresses regret about past actions or inactions.\n*   The negative form 「なければよかった」 expresses regret that something *was* done, wishing it hadn't been.",
