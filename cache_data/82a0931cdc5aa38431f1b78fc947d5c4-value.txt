  "writeup": "ともあろう (tomoarou) is a nuanced Japanese grammatical structure expressing surprise or disappointment regarding someone's actions, given their expected competence or status.  It translates roughly to \"of all people,\" \"such a person as,\" or \"would such a person as.\"  The structure emphasizes the unexpectedness of the action, often highlighting a contradiction between the individual's position or reputation and their behavior.  It's formed by combining と (to, a case-marking particle), も (mo, an adverbial particle emphasizing inclusiveness), and あろう (arou), the volitional form of the verb ある (aru, 'to be'). This volitional form implies a sense of expectation or presumption that isn't met. The structure typically precedes a noun phrase identifying the person or group in question, often followed by が (ga) or a phrase expressing the speaker's reaction.  It's used in standard speech and writing, primarily when expressing a critical or disappointed viewpoint, though sarcasm is possible depending on context.  Mastering its use requires a strong understanding of Japanese social context.",
  "etymology": "The structure's power derives from the combination of three distinct elements. と (to) marks the noun as the topic, highlighting its unexpectedness. も (mo) adds an emphatic nuance, suggesting inclusiveness and further highlighting the surprising nature of the subject's action.  Finally, あろう (arou), the volitional form of ある (aru), conveys the speaker's expectation or presumption, the breach of which is the core of the expression's meaning.  The volitional form is crucial; it expresses the potential, the 'ought to be', which is then contradicted by the following clause.",
