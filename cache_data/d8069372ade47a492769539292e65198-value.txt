    "etymology": "「という」 here functions to specify the content or reason being discussed. 「わけ」 means reason or meaning. 「ではない」 is a negation. Together, they negate the idea that something is necessarily the case or the only reason.",
    "writeup": "「というわけではない」 is an emphasized version of 「わけではない」, clarifying that something \"doesn't mean that (A)\", \"(A) is not always the case\", or \"it's not that (A)\". 「という」 often introduces a topic or quotation for discussion, so this grammar is frequently used to respond to a previous statement, correcting potential misunderstandings. A more literal translation might be, \"it is not so that (A) can be said.\" While 「だ」 before nouns and な-adjectives is common, it is not strictly required. This grammar is useful when denying that something previously mentioned is the reason for a certain outcome, whether to correct a speaker's misunderstanding or to address a direct question.",

            "setting": "informative",
            "etymology": "「訳だ」 is a shortened form of 「というわけだ」, meaning \"so that means.\"",
