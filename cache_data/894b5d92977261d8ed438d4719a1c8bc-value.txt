    "writeup": "その is classified as a 連体詞 (rentaishi), a pre-noun adjectival in Japanese. These words do not conjugate, always appearing in the same form. その indicates a thing closer to the listener than the speaker. As the name 'pre-noun adjectival' suggests, these words always appear before a noun, modifying it. Use その when referring to something the listener is more familiar with or is closer to.",
