  "writeup": "だす (dasu), or 出す in its kanji form, is a versatile verb often attached to the masu-stem (conjunctive form) of other verbs.  This construction signifies a sudden or unexpected action—a burst into activity.  Simply add だす to the masu-stem of the verb you wish to emphasize as starting abruptly.  **Important Consideration:** Unlike はじめる (hajimeru), which implies intentionality, だす often suggests an involuntary or uncontrollable action.  はじめる emphasizes the subject's conscious decision to begin, whereas だす highlights the sudden, sometimes unintentional, nature of the commencement.",
  "etymology": "The verb だす (dasu) is derived from the verb 出す (dasu), meaning \"to put out\" or \"to take out.\"  Its usage in this grammatical construction likely evolved from the idea of something suddenly \"emerging\" or \"coming out.\"",

  "post_example_writeup": "Observe how the context subtly alters the nuance of 'suddenly.'  In some cases, it's a sudden, unplanned event; in others, it's a sudden realization or a spontaneous, perhaps even romantic, gesture.
