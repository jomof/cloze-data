    "etymology": "The negative past tense is formed by conjugating the verb's final 「う」 sound to its corresponding 「あ」 sound (or 「わ」 if the original kana was 「う」) and adding 「なかった」 or 「ませんでした」. This construction combines the negative 「ない」 with the past tense 「た」 form.",
    "writeup": "To form the negative past of う-verbs, the final kana of the verb is changed to its corresponding あ-sound kana (e.g., 書く → 書か), with an exception for verbs ending in う, which change to わ (e.g., 買う → 買わ). To this, either **なかった** (for casual speech) or **ませんでした** (for polite speech) is appended. This construction indicates that an action or state \"did not occur\" or \"was not\" in the past. It is crucial to note that the verb **ある** (to be, to exist) is an exception to the casual conjugation rule; its casual negative past form is simply **なかった**, not **あらなかった**. However, its polite negative past form follows the regular pattern, becoming **ありませんでした**. Additionally, a semi-polite form, constructed by simply adding **です** to the casual **なかった** form (e.g., 食べなかったです), is very commonly used and widely accepted, despite not being strictly grammatically correct.",
