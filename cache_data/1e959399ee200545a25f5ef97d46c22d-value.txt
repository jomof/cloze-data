  "writeup": "飽く (あく) is the archaic form of 飽きる (あきる), meaning 'to tire of' or 'to be fed up with'.  When combined with まで (まで), meaning 'until,' 飽くまで (あくまでも) takes on an adverbial function, implying 'just,' 'only,' 'merely,' or 'strictly.' The literal sense—'continuing until one tires of it'—aptly conveys the nuance of unwavering adherence to a particular point.  This phrase often introduces a statement, emphasizing its limited or specific nature. The particle も (も), meaning 'even,' can be added for further emphasis.  While commonly found in polite speech when expressing a personal opinion, it subtly conveys the speaker's awareness of alternative viewpoints, softening the assertion. This is often paired with expressions like けど (kedo) or が (ga) to transition to further points or solutions.  This is a sophisticated nuance, more typically used by older speakers. ",
  "etymology": "The grammar point hinges on the archaic verb 飽く (あく), a less common variant of the modern 飽きる (あきる).  The use of this older form adds a layer of formality and perhaps a slightly poetic or literary feel to the expression, contrasting with the more commonplace modern equivalent. The addition of まで (made) further emphasizes the extent or limit of something.",

      "english": "He's just a newbie, so please be kind to him.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The politeness of 「ください」 and the use of 「なので」 makes this suitable for giving instructions politely. The phrase 「あくまでも」 softens the instruction, acknowledging that the listener may have other considerations."

    {
      "japanese": "それは**あくまでも**可能性に過ぎないからなんの役にも立たない。",
      "english": "That's merely a possibility, so it's useless.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The casual nature comes from the use of 「から」 and the somewhat blunt dismissal in 「なんの役にも立たない」.  The 「あくまでも」 softens the bluntness somewhat."

      "english": "I'm just an amateur, but I think there's a mistake in the design.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The semi-formal tone arises from the use of 「ですが」 and the relatively neutral phrasing. The inclusion of 「あくまでも」 adds a disclaimer, making the potentially critical comment less aggressive."

      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The 「くださいね」 adds a softening touch to the casual tone, making it more polite than a typical casual statement.  The 「あくまでも」 further softens the statement."

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The extremely formal language, including 「ご了承いただきたいのですが」  and the elaborate phrasing, indicates a highly formal business setting. The use of 「あくまでも」 adds a critical layer of formality and responsibility."

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The intimate register is created by the casual phrasing and the use of  「ね」. The use of 「あくまでも」  in this context shows a caring and understanding tone; the speaker understands the listener has already completed the task, but they are still offering a gentle reminder out of concern."

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "speculative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The use of 「まぁ」 and 「ので」 creates a very casual tone.  The 「あくまでも」 softens the prediction, showing that the speaker doesn't believe this prediction to be certain. The overall tone is that of light speculation."

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "academic",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The formal tone is dictated by the academic setting and the use of formal sentence structure such as  「異なりますので」 and 「取り扱いください」.   The 「あくまでも」 further emphasizes the limited scope of the paper."

      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The playful tone is evident in 「ねえ」 and the innuendo of wanting to be with someone \"forever.\"  The 「飽くまで」 adds a layer of playful ambiguity, suggesting the statement might be only partly true.  The intimacy comes from the use of 「ね」. This is how a younger woman might flirt."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the nuance of 'just,' 'only,' 'merely,' or 'strictly' shifts subtly depending on the context. The key is to understand that the speaker is deliberately limiting the scope of their statement, often to soften a potential disagreement, to express a tentative opinion, or to add a touch of playful ambiguity.",
