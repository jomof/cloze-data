  "writeup": "This grammar point, using た末 (tamatsu) or の末 (nomatsu), translates to 'after' or 'as a result of,' but carries a deeper nuance.  It's used with past-tense verbs or nouns followed by の.  The key is the word 末 (matsu), meaning 'end tip.'  The に following 末 indicates the 'tip' as the culmination of a process.  While often translated simply as 'after (A), (B),'  た末・の末 emphasizes a series of events leading to a final point or conclusion—a result of sustained effort or struggle.  The outcome can be positive or negative, but it inherently suggests a journey or process culminating in the final event.  This grammar point is suitable for a wide range of registers, from casual conversation to formal settings, making it versatile in your communication.",
  "etymology": "The etymology lies in the word 末 (matsu), meaning \"end\" or \"tip.\" The grammar point uses the past tense form of verbs (た) combined with 末 to indicate a process leading to a conclusion or final result.  The particle に further emphasizes that final point, almost as if specifying a point in space or time after a series of events. The structure is deeply connected to the concept of process and culmination within Japanese thought.",
