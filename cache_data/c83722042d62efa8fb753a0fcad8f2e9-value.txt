  "writeup": "は元より (ha moto yori), commonly written in hiragana, is a formal grammar pattern conveying 'not only (A), but also (B),' or 'let alone (A), (B)'.  It combines は (topic marker), 元 (moto, 'origin'), and より (yori, 'than').  This highlights that 'even compared to the original fact of (A), (B) is also true'. (A) is usually something obvious or well-known. はもとより can follow nouns or nominalized verb phrases (using の or こと). Alternatively, it can emphasize (A) as the basis for (B), translating closer to 'from the start, (A) is (B),' or 'by nature, (A) is (B)'. Context clarifies the intended meaning.  This phrase is used more often in formal settings and written text.",
