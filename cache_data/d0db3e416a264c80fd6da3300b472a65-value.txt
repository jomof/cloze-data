  "writeup": "The verb おわる (owaru) means \"to finish\" or \"to end.\"  It's an intransitive verb, meaning the subject experiences the action rather than performing it on an object.  This contrasts with verbs like 終える (oeru), which is the transitive counterpart and implies a more deliberate completion. おわる is commonly used in everyday conversation across various contexts.  Mastering its conjugations is key to expressing different tenses and politenesses.  Let's delve into its versatile usage.",
