    "etymology": "The phrase 「は言うまでもない」 literally translates to \"there is no need to say.\" It combines the topic marker 「は」, the verb 「言う」(to say), 「まで」(up to), 「も」(also), and 「ない」(not), indicating that something is so obvious that it doesn't require mentioning.",
    "writeup": "「は言うまでもない」 is a grammar structure used to express that something is **obvious or goes without saying**. It is often translated as \"it goes without saying that...\" or \"needless to say...\" The particle 「は」 marks the topic, and the phrase emphasizes that there's no need to mention the obvious. It can be followed by が to introduce a contrasting point.",
