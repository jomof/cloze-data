  "writeup": "だらけ is a suffix used to express when one thing is 'completely covered in' or 'full of' another thing.  It attaches to the end of nouns, sometimes followed by the particle の and a second noun. This second noun is often omitted if the context is clear.  A fun fact: だらけ primarily depicts things scattered, not a uniform covering. Thus, it doesn't sound natural describing something uniformly coated, unlike, say, a wall painted uniformly white. ",
  "etymology": "The etymology of だらけ is fascinating.  It's believed to originate from the image of something being scattered or dispersed, like stars in the night sky or raindrops on a window. This inherent sense of dispersion is key to its appropriate usage.",
