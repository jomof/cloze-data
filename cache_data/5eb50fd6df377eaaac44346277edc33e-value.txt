    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ている」 is formed by combining the te-form 「て」 of a verb with the auxiliary verb 「いる」. 「いる」 originally means 'to exist' (animate objects). So, literally, 「食べている」 (tabeteiru) means 'existing in the state of eating'.",
    "writeup": "「ている」 is a construction used in Japanese to convey that someone or something is existing in a constant state of \"doing\" the verb that comes before 「て」. In English, depending on the verb, this can be translated as 'is (A)', 'am (A), or 'are (A)~ing'. The expression is made by adding 「いる」 to the て form of either る-Verbs or う-Verbs. Due to 「いる」 being one of the verbs for \"existing\" in Japanese, the 「ている」 form means something closer to \"continuing to exist in a specific state\", rather than (A)~ing in English. This is why verbs like 「死ぬ」 and 「知る」 appear as the 「ている」 form in Japanese, when they would appear as the past form in English. It is often shortened to 「てる」 in casual speech, and all tenses can be used.",
