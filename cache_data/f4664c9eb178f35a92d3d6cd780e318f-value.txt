    "etymology": "「ぬ」 is the attributive form of the classical negative auxiliary verb 「ず」.  In classical Japanese, 「ず」 was used similarly to the modern 「ない」 to negate verbs. The form 「ぬ」 was specifically used when modifying a noun.",
    "writeup": "「ぬ」 is the attributive form of 「ず」, a classical auxiliary verb used for negation, much like 「ない」.  It connects to verbs in the same way 「ない」 does.  As the attributive form, 「ぬ」 traditionally modified nouns directly following it. While this direct modification is less common today, 「ぬ」 persists in set expressions and can be used for stylistic effect, particularly to evoke a classical or archaic feel. It can lend a character a more \"old-fashioned\" way of speaking.  When negating the verb 「いる」, the older form 「おる」 is used, becoming 「おらぬ」. Similarly, 「する」 becomes 「せぬ」, and 「くる」 becomes 「こぬ」, consistent with the conjugation patterns of 「ず」.",
