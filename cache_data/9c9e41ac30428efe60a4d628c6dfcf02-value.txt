  "writeup": "The Japanese expression \"わ〜わ\" (wa〜wa) is an adverbial particle that emphasizes a large quantity, successive occurrences, or an increase in something.  It's often translated as \"more and more (A)\", \"(A) keeps on happening,\" or \"so much (A).\"  It can be used positively or negatively.  The structure is simple: place \"わ\" after the dictionary form of a verb, then repeat the verb with a second \"わ.\" The emphasis lies on the speaker's surprise at the amount or extent of the action. This structure is primarily used by men but can occasionally be used by women.  There are various forms of \"わ\" depending on sentence position, each with its own gender usage patterns that require further study.  When used with a する-verb, often the second instance of the action is omitted, resulting in a form like 勉強するわするわ (benkyou suru wa suru wa) instead of 勉強するわ勉強するわ (benkyou suru wa benkyou suru wa).  Interestingly, \"わ\" is a more emphatic version of the particle \"は\" (wa), originating from a phonetic shift.  It retains a similar meaning of 'as for (A),' but with intensified emphasis.",
  "etymology": "The particle \"わ\" (wa) in \"わ〜わ\" is etymologically derived from the particle \"は\" (ha), which typically marks the topic of a sentence.  The change from \"は\" to \"わ\" likely reflects a process of sound change and emphasis, giving \"わ\" a more forceful and expressive quality.  The repetition of the structure adds layers of emphasis to the main verb, representing the feeling of surprise and overwhelming occurrence.",
