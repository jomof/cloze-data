  "writeup": "The phrase \"に際して\" (ni saishite) translates to \"on the occasion of\" or \"at the time of.\"  It's a formal expression often used in official settings or written documents.  It indicates the context or circumstances surrounding an event or action.  The structure combines the particle \"に\" (ni) indicating a point in time or circumstance, and the て-form of the verb \"際する\" (sai suru), meaning \"to come to pass\" or \"to occur.\" While literally meaning 'when [something] comes to pass',  it's often understood more naturally as 'on the occasion of' or 'at the time of'.  This construction is typically followed by a noun or a verb in its dictionary form. \n\n**Important Considerations:**  While similar to 際に (sai ni), there's a subtle difference. に際して emphasizes the **approach** to or **preparation** for a situation, implying anticipation or the actions taken in advance. 際に, in contrast, more directly marks the *exact moment* of the event. Consequently, に際して is rarely used with past-tense verbs.  It's primarily used for events that are expected to happen in the future or are still ongoing.",
