  "writeup": "This grammar point, ～ても～なくても, provides a nuanced way to express \"whether or not\" in Japanese.  It literally translates to \"even if ~, even if not ~.\" This emphasizes that the outcome remains unchanged regardless of the condition.  The structure typically involves the same verb conjugated twice: once with the て-form (て) and again with the negative て-form (なくて). It's primarily used with verbs, although some creative adaptation might occur in other cases.  Mastering this adds depth and naturalness to your Japanese expression.  It's a versatile tool suitable for various registers and contexts, allowing you to express indifference to a particular outcome elegantly.",
  "etymology": "The structure's etymology stems from the combination of the て-form, indicating a continuous or conditional action, and the negative て-form (なくて), indicating the absence of that action. The use of も (mo), meaning \"even,\" further emphasizes the irrelevance of the condition.",
