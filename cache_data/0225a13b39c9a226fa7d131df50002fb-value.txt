    "etymology": "The grammar point に引き換え is composed of に (a particle), 引き (hiki), the conjunctive form of the verb 引く (hiku, \"to pull back\"), and 換え (kae), the conjunctive form of the verb 換える (kaeru, \"to exchange\" or \"to switch\").  The literal sense is of pulling back from one thing and switching to another, highlighting a distinct contrast.",
    "writeup": "に引き換え is used to express a **stark contrast** between two things. It can be translated as \"in contrast to,\" \"compared with,\" or \"on the other hand.\"  The core idea is a noticeable shift or difference.  It emphasizes that while one thing is a certain way, the other is significantly different, often with a sense of surprise or observation about the disparity.  The structure is typically **A に引き換え B**, where A and B represent the two contrasting elements.  A の is required before nouns, い-adjectives, and verbs preceding に引き換え, and なの is needed before な-adjectives.  Often, the speaker will implicitly evaluate one of the contrasted items more positively or negatively than the other, though this isn't always explicitly stated.  Be mindful that に引き換え is used for **observable facts**, not assumptions or guesses.  The phrase それにひきかえ can be used to start a sentence, drawing a comparison to a previously mentioned situation.",
