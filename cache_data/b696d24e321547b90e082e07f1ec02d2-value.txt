  "etymology": "それなら is a compound phrase. それ (sore) means 'that' and なら (nara) is a conditional particle derived from the verb なる (naru, 'to become').  The combination implies a conditional relationship based on a previously mentioned fact. The 'なら' portion highlights the speaker's inference or suggestion based on the preceding statement.",
  "writeup": "The Japanese phrase それなら (sore nara) functions as a conjunction, indicating a consequential relationship based on a preceding statement.  It's used to express \"Then,\" \"In that case,\" or \"If so.\"  It's particularly common in responses, suggesting a deduction or proposition following the listener's comment.  Think of it as a natural way to say 'If that's the case, then...'  While similar phrases exist such as だったら (dattara) and それだったら (sore dattara), それなら offers a slightly more concise and direct manner of expressing the conditional consequence.  It's a versatile phrase applicable in various conversational settings and registers, making it a valuable tool for fluent communication.",
