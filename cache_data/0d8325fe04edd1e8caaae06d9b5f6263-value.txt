  "writeup": "なんか and なんて are versatile Japanese particles often used to express things like 'such as,' 'things like,' or to add emphasis.  They're frequently compared to など (nado), and while there's overlap, subtle differences exist.  Think of なんて as an abbreviation of などという (nado to iu), 'to say something like...'—it's more commonly used after conjugatable words (verbs, adjectives).  なんか, conversely, typically follows nouns.  However,  most native speakers won't consider it incorrect to use either with any word type.  Interestingly, both particles often carry a slight negative or downplaying connotation.  Used self-deprecatingly, it shows humility; used about others, it can be mildly insulting.  Don't let this deter you! Many use them simply as casual fillers in modern speech.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of なんか and なんて traces back to the particle など (nado), meaning 'et cetera' or 'and so on.'  なんか can be seen as a contraction, losing formality and gaining a colloquial flavor.  なんて further develops this, adding the implication of quoting or mentioning something specific, leading to its common usage with verbal elements.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "北海道がこんなに寒いなんて**思わなかった**。",
      "english": "I didn't think Hokkaido would be this cold.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the past-tense polite form 「思わなかった」. This casual register is suitable for a conversation between friends or family members sharing their travel experiences.  There's nothing inherently gendered or age-specific about this statement."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "テレビなんか**叩けば**だいたい直るだろ。",
      "english": "Things like TVs usually get fixed if you hit them, right?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the conditional form 「叩けば」. This casual, even slightly cynical tone is suitable for a conversation among close friends, implying shared knowledge of common household fixes. The 「だろ」 ending adds a confident assumption of shared understanding."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "こんな嵐の中走るなんて、**頭おかしいんじゃない**。",
      "english": "Running in a storm like this? You must be crazy!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "exclamatory",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses a colloquial expression 「頭おかしいんじゃない」. The casual register and somewhat incredulous tone suggest a close relationship between the speakers; this sentiment would not likely be expressed towards someone unfamiliar or of higher social status."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "心配なんて**している場合じゃない**。",
      "english": "This isn't the time for worrying.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This concise sentence utilizes the negative form with the verb 「している」. Its directness and informal register suggest a serious or urgent situation, appropriate for close friends or family. The emphasis created by 「なんて」 underscores the urgency of the situation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "私なんか5年間スペイン語の勉強をしているのにまだ全然会話ができないです。(Humility)",
      "english": "Despite studying Spanish for 5 years, I still can't speak it well.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「私なんか」 (watashi nanka) is a classic example of self-deprecation in Japanese.  The polite ending 「です」shows respect. This humble tone would be fitting when talking to a superior or someone you respect;  「私なんか」 emphasizes the speaker's perceived inadequacy."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "お前なんてどうせ、家でゴロゴロしているだけだろ。(Insult)",
      "english": "Someone like you probably just loafs around at home.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "condescending",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the vulgar 「お前」 (omae) and the dismissive 「どうせ」 (dōse) creates a very harsh and condescending tone.  The use of 「なんて」 further amplifies the insult. This language is extremely informal and inappropriate for most situations."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "紹介なんていりません。自分で恋人を見つけます。",
      "english": "I don't need any introductions; I'll find a lover myself.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This statement is flirty and assertive.  The confident tone, combined with the rejection of outside assistance in finding a lover (「紹介なんていりません」), suggests a self-assured and perhaps slightly defiant personality.  The use of 「なんて」 downplays the importance of introductions, subtly highlighting the speaker's independence and self-reliance."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "嘘なんか**つかないよ**。信じてよ。",
      "english": "I wouldn't lie. Trust me.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "persuasive",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「よ」 at the end of 「つかないよ」 softens the declarative sentence and adds a gentle, persuasive tone. This is characteristic of a female speaker attempting to reassure a male listener.  The plain form makes it informal, and the direct plea for trust enhances the flirty subtext."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "雨なんかに負けている場合じゃないですよ。",
      "english": "This is no time to give in to the rain.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "persuasive",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite form 「ですよ」 (desu yo) elevates the register, making it suitable for a slightly more formal or respectful situation, such as a motivational speech. The emphasis on the rain 「雨なんかに」 through the use of 「なんて」 gives it more significance."

      "meaning": "Such as, Like, So much as",

      "term": "こそ",
      "meaning": "For sure, For certain, Even more so, Underlined or bolded text",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the formality and the intended emphasis.  など is formal,  とか～とか is listing-focused,  って is topical,  といった is formal, and こそ emphasizes.  なんか and なんて fit in a more casual, nuanced space, often with subtle negative undertones."
