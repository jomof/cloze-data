    "writeup": "**ばかりでなく** combines the adverbial particle **ばかり** with a conjugated negative form of the auxiliary verb **だ**. It conveys the meaning of \"not only A, but also B\" or \"as well as A, B\".  Because **ばかり** is an adverbial particle, it can be used with the attributive form of other words.

Like other grammar points that negate **だ**, several forms exist, including **でなく**, **でなくて**, **ではなく**, **ではなくて**, **じゃなく**, and **じゃなくて**.  Adding the particle **は** (as in **ばかりでなくは**) further emphasizes the negation.

**Important Consideration:**

*   **ばかりでなく** is considered more formal than **だけでなく**.  While both have the same core meaning, **だけでなく** is encountered more frequently in everyday conversation and writing.
