  "writeup": "The adverbial phrase もしも～なら/もしも～でも enhances the conditional nature of sentences, implying a stronger hypothetical scenario than simply using もし.  It translates best as \"supposing that\" or \"if by any chance.\"  The nuance of もしも lies in its emphasis on the hypothetical nature of the situation.  It's often used to express a wish, a possibility, or a tentative plan, especially when some uncertainty is involved.  The addition of なら refines the condition further, stating a direct consequence based on that supposition.  If ても is added, it introduces the idea of 'even if', encompassing a wider range of hypothetical situations that might occur. This phrase is versatile and commonly used in everyday conversation across various registers.",
  "etymology": "もしも is a compound of もし (if) and も (an emphatic particle).  The addition of も intensifies the hypothetical nature of the condition, suggesting a more tentative or uncertain situation than もし alone.  The combination of もしも with なら or でも creates a nuanced conditional expression that adds depth to the hypothetical scenario.",

  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to distinguishing these similar expressions lies in their level of emphasis on the hypothetical. もしも carries a stronger sense of uncertainty and tentativeness than もし or なら.  たとえ emphasizes contrast and resilience, while でも broadens the hypothetical scope.  Choosing the right expression depends on the degree of uncertainty, contrast, and inclusiveness you want to convey."
