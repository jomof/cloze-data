  "writeup": "てからというもの is an extension of the grammar point てから, meaning 'after (A)', and partners と言う ('that which is') with もの ('thing'). It's often translated as 'ever since (A)' and always expresses a new state of (B) that has been ongoing since (A).  Although the literal translation is 'with that which was from (A)', the ongoing nature of (B) is implied. Like てから, this structure follows verbs in their て-form.  While less common, からというもの can follow それ at the beginning of a new sentence, linking back to the previous sentence. \n\n**Caution:**  Since this phrase highlights something ongoing since (A), it's not used when (A) is very recent.  However, 'long' is subjective and depends on the outcome.",
  "etymology": "The phrase combines the て-form of a verb (indicating the completion of an action) with から (from, since),  というもの (which means something like 'the fact that...,' 'the thing that is...'), creating a nuanced expression of a lasting consequence or change following a past event.",

    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the nuance changes depending on the context and the sentence structure. The key is to focus on the lasting impact of a past event. While \"以来\" (since then) often substitutes for てからというもの in less formal settings, it doesn't carry the same level of nuance about an ongoing change.",
