  "writeup": "The grammar point \"Verb[volitional]とする\" adds nuance to the volitional form of a verb, expressing an intention or attempt to perform an action.  It's formed by taking the volitional form of a verb (using the -よう/-よう suffix) and adding とする.  This construction emphasizes the intention behind the action, suggesting a deliberate effort or a state of being about to do something.  Unlike simply using the volitional form alone, とする highlights the act of *trying* or *attempting*, even if the action is not ultimately successful.  The particle と indicates a resulting state, further reinforcing the focus on the attempt itself.  Think of it as expressing a decision to act, followed by the action itself.  This contrasts with simply stating an intention.  While ようとするcan also show an interruption of one action by another, the nuance shifts from 'endeavoring' to 'being underway.'",
  "etymology": "The particle と marks a resultative state.  する is the verb \"to do.\"  Combining the volitional form with とする creates a sophisticated expression of intention and effort.",
