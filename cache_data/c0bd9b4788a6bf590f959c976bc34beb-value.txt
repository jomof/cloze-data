    "meaning": "Adjective + する, To make something/someone (more)",
    "etymology": "The grammar point combines an adjective with the verb する (to do). For な-adjectives, the particle に is inserted, while い-adjectives drop the い and add く before する. This construction transforms the adjective into an adverbial form, indicating the manner in which the action of する is performed.  Essentially, you are 'doing' the state of the adjective.",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Standard",
        "使用域": "一般"
    },
    "writeup": "When combined with a な-Adjective, にする (or くする in the case of い-Adjectives) carries the meaning of \"to make more (A)\". Just like the にする grammar point used for highlighting decisions, this にする construction implies that the speaker has a high level of control over the action. Essentially, this changes the adjective into an adverb, and then uses する to show that the adjective itself is the thing that is being done.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   にする is used with な-adjectives. The な is dropped and replaced with に.\n*   くする is used with い-adjectives. The い is changed to く.\n*   This grammar point emphasizes the **active** effort of making something a certain way.\n*   It indicates a deliberate action to change a state.",
