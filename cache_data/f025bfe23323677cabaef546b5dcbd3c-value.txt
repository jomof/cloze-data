    "etymology": "The past tense form of い-adjectives is created by combining the stem of the い-adjective (removing the い) with 「かった」. 「かった」 is the past form of the auxiliary verb 「ある」 (to be), which, in its adjectival form, modifies the い-adjective to indicate past tense. The polite form 「かったです」 adds 「です」, the polite copula, to 「かった」.",
    "writeup": "To create the past form of い-adjectives, you add the auxiliary verb 「た」 to the past conjunction form of the い-adjective. The past conjunction form is created by removing the 「い」 and replacing it with 「かっ」. This structure translates to \"was\" or \"were\" in English.\n\nFor example:\n*   「面白い」 - \"Interesting\" (dictionary form).\n*   「面白かった」 - The casual past form.\n\nFrom these examples, we can see how the casual past form is constructed. In modern Japanese, simply adding 「です」 after 「かった」 is considered standard polite past form. Although widely used and considered polite by many, adding 「です」 after 「かった」 is not academically correct. However, given its common usage, it's acceptable in most situations.",
