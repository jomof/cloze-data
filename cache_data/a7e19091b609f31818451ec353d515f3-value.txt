  "writeup": "The adverbial phrase にしては (nishite wa) is a common way to express a comparison or unexpected contrast in Japanese.  It's often translated as \"considering...\" or \"even for...\".  The structure combines the particle に (ni), indicating a point of reference, with the te-form of する (suru, 'to do'), and the topic-marking particle は (wa).  This creates a nuanced expression that highlights a surprising or unexpected aspect of something.  For example, \"彼は毎日漢字の勉強をしているにしては全然漢字を読めない\" (Kare wa mainichi kanji no benkyou o shiteiru nishite wa zenzen kanji o yomenai) means \"Considering he studies kanji every day, he can't read kanji at all.\"  This implies a contrast between expectation (daily study) and reality (inability to read).  The nuance subtly conveys a sense of surprise or disappointment.  It's versatile and can be used with nouns and verbs alike, making it a valuable tool for expressing unexpected contrasts in a natural and idiomatic way.",
