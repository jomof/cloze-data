    "etymology": "The 「て」 form comes from the conjunctive particle 「て」, which is used to connect verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech. The 「で」 form for nouns and na-adjectives originates from the copula 「だ」, specifically its conjunctive form. 「で」 is the same 「で」 as in 「である」, the more formal version of 「だ」.",
    "writeup": "The 「て」 form of an い-adjective, or the 「で」 form of a noun (or な-adjective) is used to connect words, much like the 「て」 form of a verb. It carries the meaning of \"and\" and is used for linking multiple qualities or traits of something. For い-adjectives, you change the last い to 「く」 (the form used for conjugation) and then add 「て」. For nouns and な-adjectives, you add 「で」 to the base form (not 「な」 or 「だ」). Note that 「て」 and 「で」 are different structures here. 「て」 is the same conjunction particle that is used with verbs (making い-adjectives similar to verbs), while 「で」 is a form of 「だ」 that is used for conjugation. It is the same 「で」 as the one used in the formal version of 「だ」, 「である」, which you will learn later.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\nLike other 「て」 forms, the 「て」 (or 「で」) form of other words can have several possible meanings. These meanings are:\n\n*   Linking - Like \"and\" in English.\n*   Reasons - Like \"with (A)\" or \"because of (A)\" in English.\n*   Manner - Like \"to do (B) in an (A) way\" in English.\n\nAs with all other conjugations of 「いい」, remember that it will be 「よくて」, and not 「いくて」.",
