    "etymology": "「よう」comes from the verb 「言う」 (iu, to say), evolving over time to indicate a state or condition that resembles what is being described. 「だ」 is the plain form of the copula 「です」, indicating affirmation or declaration.",
    "writeup": "「ようだ」 is similar to 「みたい」, and is used to express observations about something. It indicates **likelihood or resemblance** based on direct information or experience. The speaker has a high degree of confidence in their statement. 「ようだ」 can be used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns, but remember to use 「な」 before な-adjectives and 「の」 before nouns. While 「ようだ」 and 「そうだ」 are sometimes interchangeable, 「そうだ」 implies less confidence than 「ようだ」. Thus, 「ようだ」 is preferred for obvious or easily observable facts. Note that 「ようだ」 is more formal than 「みたい」, and is less common in casual conversation. 「ようだ」is often written as 「様だ」 in kanji.",
