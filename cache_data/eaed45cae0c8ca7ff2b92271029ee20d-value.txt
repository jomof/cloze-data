    "writeup": "**だんだん (dandan)** is an adverb used to express the slight but constant progression of something. It originates from the kanji construction **段々**, suggesting 'step by step,' 'stepwise,' or 'steadily.' Similar to adverbs like **ほとんど**, **だんだん** modifies the meaning of entire phrases rather than single words. To use **だんだん**, place it before the phrase you want to express as gradually increasing.",
    "etymology": "The term **だんだん** comes from the reduplication of the word **段 (dan)**, which means \"step\" or \"level\". The repetition emphasizes the gradual and stepwise nature of the progression.",
