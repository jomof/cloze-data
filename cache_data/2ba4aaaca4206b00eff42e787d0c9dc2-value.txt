  "writeup": "を皮切りに (wo kawakiri ni) is a grammatical structure used with nouns to indicate a starting point from which something expands or continues.  It's most commonly translated as \"starting with\" or \"beginning with.\"  This structure combines the adverbial particle を (wo), the noun 皮切り (kawakiri, meaning 'beginning' or 'outset'), and the particle に (ni). It follows nouns or nominalized phrases, setting the stage for a subsequent development or continuation.  Instead of に (ni) itself, にして (ni shite) and として (to shite) are also standard variations with essentially the same meaning.  Important Considerations: It's less common to use を皮切りに with natural phenomena or negative outcomes. The resultant event is usually positive and has a clear agent. Etymology: While 皮切り (kawakiri) literally means 'to cut a hide,' this imagery helps visualize the creation of a starting point from which something expands, much like flaying an animal's skin.",
