    "etymology": "The grammar point 「Verb+にいく」 combines a verb stem with the particle 「に」 and the verb 「いく」(to go). The 「に」 particle indicates direction or purpose. Together, they express the idea of going *for the purpose of* doing something. It is a very common expression, and important for everyday conversation.",
    "writeup": "「Verb+にいく」 is used to express going somewhere for a specific purpose. The verb preceding 「にいく」 must be in its stem form (masu-stem). This construction translates to \"to go to do something\" or \"to go in order to do something.\" It is crucial to remember that the verb before 「に」 is always in its stem form. The 「に」 particle here is crucial; it explicitly marks the purpose or objective of the movement, distinguishing it from simply stating a destination. If you have already gone somewhere to do something, you would use 「(Verb stem) に 来た」 instead. This grammar point is essential for expressing intentions and activities involving movement.",
