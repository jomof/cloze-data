    "etymology": "ございます is the polite form of the verb ござる (御座る), which originally meant \"to sit\". Over time, it evolved to mean \"to be\" or \"to exist\" in a humble or polite way. The addition of ます makes it even more polite.",
    "writeup": "**ございます** is the polite form of the verb **ある** (for inanimate objects) or **いる** (for animate objects), meaning \"to be\" or \"to exist\". It is considered **polite speech** (**敬語**) and is used to show respect to the listener or the subject being discussed.

While its base form, **ござる (御座る)**, literally means \"to sit\", its usage has broadened to signify existence in a humble way.  Although **ござる** is rarely used in modern daily conversation, it appears in historical dramas, manga, and other media to create a certain atmosphere.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Formality:** **ございます** is more formal than **あります** or **います**.
*   **Usage with People:** While **ございます** can be used to refer to people, the honorific verb **いらっしゃる** is generally preferred for showing even greater respect.
*   **でございます:** The phrase **でございます** is a separate, important structure which is the polite form of **である** and will be covered elsewhere.

Essentially, **ございます** allows you to express existence or being in a polite and respectful manner.",
