  "writeup": "とは限らない (to wa kagiranai) is a useful phrase to express that something isn't always true or guaranteed.  It's a formal expression, often used in more serious or academic settings.  The structure cleverly combines the topic-marking particle と (to), highlighting the subject, the adverbial particle は (wa), emphasizing the condition, and the negative form of the verb 限る (kagiru, to limit).  This negation,  限らない (kagiranai), literally means 'is not limited,' implying there are other possibilities besides the initially presented one.  This grammatical structure can be applied to verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns (with だ added after な-adjectives and nouns).",
  "etymology": "The phrase's core lies in the verb 限る (kagiru), meaning 'to limit' or 'to be restricted.'  Its origin traces back to classical Japanese where the concept of limitation played a more prominent role in expressing possibilities and certainties.  The modern usage reflects this historical emphasis on defining boundaries and possibilities.",

    {
      "japanese": "日本に2年間住んでいるからといって、日本語を話せるとは**限らない**。",
      "english": "Just because someone has lived in Japan for two years doesn't mean they can speak Japanese.",
      "register": "Formal",
      "setting": "Informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「からといって」 (karatoitte), a common phrase indicating a conditional premise, before stating that the conclusion isn't inevitable.  The formal register reflects the general tone used when discussing broad statements and counterarguments."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "日が出ているからといって、暖かいとは**限らない**。",
      "english": "Even if the sun is shining, it doesn't necessarily mean it's warm.",
      "register": "Semi-formal",
      "setting": "Informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a more natural and commonly used sentence compared to the previous example, still maintaining a semi-formal register due to the nature of the statement itself. The use of 「からといって」 (karatoitte) again reinforces the conditional premise."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼が社長だからといって、必ずしも親切とは**限らない**。",
      "english": "Just because he's the president doesn't necessarily mean he's kind.",
      "register": "Formal",
      "setting": "Informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This example adds a nuance to the expression by including the word 「必ずしも」 (kanarashimo), which also conveys the idea of 'not always' or 'not necessarily,' but in a more formal manner. The sentence structure is quite formal."

    {
      "japanese": "イケメンだからといって、性格が良いとは**限らない**じゃない？",
      "english": "Just because someone is handsome doesn't necessarily mean they have a good personality, right?",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The addition of 「じゃない？」 (janai?) at the end makes this a casual question.  The use of 「イケメン」 (ikemen) is a casual term for a handsome man. This sentence is a typical example of a female casually rejecting the superficial."

    {
      "japanese": "高級な車に乗っているからといって、金持ちとは**限らない**よ。",

      "register": "Casual",
      "setting": "Informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「よ」 (yo) at the end adds emphasis and softens the tone slightly, making it sound more conversational. The sentence structure is casual."

    {
      "japanese": "あなたが私のことを好きだと言ってくれるからといって、私があなたと付き合うとは**限らない**わ。",

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「わ」 (wa) at the end is a typical feminine ending, adding a touch of playful defiance to the rejection.  The direct and somewhat blunt rejection is a way for a woman to convey that while flattered, she doesn't necessarily reciprocate the feelings."

    {
      "japanese": "毎日一緒にいるからといって、お互いのことを何でも知っているとは**限らない**ものだよ。",

Consider the context and the desired level of formality when choosing the most appropriate expression.  Using とは限らない in a casual conversation might sound overly formal, while using a more colloquial phrase in a formal setting could sound inappropriate."
