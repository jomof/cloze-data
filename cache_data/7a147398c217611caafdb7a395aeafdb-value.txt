    "etymology": "The particle 「たり」 comes from the verb 「足(た)りる」 (tariru), meaning \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be enough.\" In this grammar point, it evolved to indicate that the listed items are sufficient examples, but not an exhaustive list.",
    "writeup": "The 「たり〜たりする」 construction is used to list actions or states without implying a specific order or completeness. It conveys the meaning of \"doing things like X and Y\" or \"sometimes X and sometimes Y.\" Unlike the 「て」 form, which implies a sequence of events, 「たり〜たりする」 suggests that the listed items are examples, and there may be other unmentioned activities or states. The final 「たり」 is usually followed by 「する」 (or 「した」 for past tense).",
