    "etymology": "The auxiliary verbs 「れる」 and 「られる」 originate from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「る」 and 「らる」, respectively.  「る」 initially denoted spontaneity or potential, while 「らる」 indicated passive, potential, or respect. Over time, these functions became more distinct, with 「れる」 and 「られる」 in modern Japanese primarily expressing passive voice, potential, and respect. The added 「ら」 in 「られる」 is thought to be an emphatic marker or a result of phonetic changes over time.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **Verb［れる・られる］** indicates the passive voice in Japanese.  It conveys that the subject of the sentence is receiving an action, often implying a lack of control or that something is done *to* the subject. This grammatical structure can also express possibility, spontaneity, or respect, though this explanation focuses on the passive meaning.  To form the passive, for **う-verbs (godan verbs)**, change the final 「う」 sound to the corresponding 「あ」 sound and add 「れる」. For example, 「書く」(kaku - to write) becomes 「書かれる」(kakareru - to be written). For **る-verbs (ichidan verbs)**, simply replace the final 「る」 with 「られる」. For instance, 「食べる」(taberu - to eat) becomes 「食べられる」(taberareru - to be eaten). The irregular verbs 「する」(suru - to do) becomes 「される」(sareru - to be done), and 「くる」(kuru - to come) becomes 「こられる」(korareru - to be come). The person performing the action is usually marked with the particle 「に」, though 「から」 can be used when there's no direct physical contact. This passive construction emphasizes the recipient of the action, sometimes highlighting a negative or unwanted experience. It's **important** to note that while often translated as passive, the nuance in Japanese focuses on the subject's lack of agency.  The subject is often referred to as 「なる人」 (the person who becomes), and the doer is 「する人」 (the person who does).",
