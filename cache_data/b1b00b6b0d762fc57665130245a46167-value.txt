  "writeup": "つもりだ (or です) is a versatile Japanese grammar point often translated as 'intend to' or 'plan to.'  It follows the plain (dictionary) form of verbs or the ない-form, significantly altering the nuance.  Using ないつもり indicates actively avoiding something, unlike つもりはない, which simply means having no intention.  The latter's は can be replaced with が (implying disinterest) or じゃ (expressing that (A) isn't the goal).  The word つもり itself stems from the verb 積もる (tsumoru), 'to pile up' or 'to accumulate,' lending a unique flavor;  it implies a deliberate buildup of intention or motivation, even something unexpected. For example,  「謝ってるつもり？ 」(sha-tteru tsumori?) doesn't just mean 'is that an apology?' but rather suggests surprise or disbelief at the feigned apology—as if the speaker is saying, 'You really had the nerve to call that an apology?!'",
  "etymology": "The word つもり (tsumori) originates from the verb 積もる (tsumoru), meaning \"to pile up\" or \"to accumulate.\" This etymology adds depth to its meaning, suggesting a deliberate accumulation of intent or feeling.",
