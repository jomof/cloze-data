  "writeup": "にしてみれば, typically written entirely in hiragana, is a nuanced expression used to present a hypothetical perspective.  It's employed when the speaker contemplates how a situation might appear from another person's viewpoint.  Common translations include 'from the point of view of (A), (B)', 'in the case of (A), (B)', or 'for (A), (B)'.  The literal meaning is closer to 'assuming I were (A), then looking from that perspective, (B)'.  This construction always follows a noun representing a person or a group of people, with the subsequent clause (B) often detailing the speaker's assumption of how that person would feel in the given circumstance.  Therefore, sentences using にしてみれば often conclude with expressions like だろう, でしょう, かもしれない, or similar phrases implying uncertainty or hypothetical conjecture.  Its structure combines the case-marking particle に, the te-form of する (to do), and the hypothetical form of 見る (to see), 見れば.  Because it's exclusively used after nouns indicating individuals or groups, the (B) portion usually focuses on the speaker's imagined feelings or reactions for that person within the context.",

      "nuance": "The speaker uses \"私\" (I/me), establishing a personal perspective.  The contrast between \"簡単\" (easy) and \"難しい\" (hard) is clear and natural in casual conversation. The use of \"だけど\" (but) shows a casual tone."

      "japanese": "あの時、彼女にしてみれば、どれほど辛かっただろうか。",
      "english": "I wonder how painful it must have been for her at that time.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "nuance": "The sentence shows a respectful distance to the person it speaks about using \"彼女\" (she/her).  The use of \"だろうか\" (I wonder) expresses a degree of uncertainty and politeness that's appropriate in a formal register. The focus is on sympathy for the person instead of being presumptuous of their emotions."
    }
  ],
  "etymology": "The structure of にしてみれば is a fascinating blend of grammatical elements.  The particle に marks the topic, て-form of する indicates an action performed, and 見れば is the conditional form of 見る (to see).  This combination creates a hypothetical scenario: 'if one were to assume the position of [noun] and then observe...' The resulting meaning is not just about seeing, but about perceiving from a specific standpoint. This highlights the elegant way Japanese grammar constructs meaning through combinations of particles and verb forms."
