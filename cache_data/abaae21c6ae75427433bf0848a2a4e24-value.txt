    "writeup": "ぜ is an emphatic sentence-ending particle in Japanese, similar to よ, used to emphasize what the speaker is saying. However, it's not as strong as particles like ぞ. ぜ is used at the end of a sentence in plain form, including after auxiliary verbs. With nouns, ぜ follows the auxiliary verb だ. It's primarily used when speaking to someone the speaker is familiar with or on close terms with, often with a hint of friendliness. It can also be used towards a rival or someone with a similar relationship. Unlike ぞ, ぜ is almost exclusively used by men.\n\n**Etymology**: Rather than being distinct from ぞ, ぜ actually originates from ぞ followed by え, an alternative form of い, as seen in だい or かい. Since い is often used in a friendly manner, ぜ maintains that nuance. In short, ぞえ became ぜ over time and evolved into its own particle.",
    "etymology": "The particle 「ぜ」 is believed to have originated from the combination of the sentence-ending particle 「ぞ」 and 「え」, where 「え」 is a variation of 「い」, a particle indicating emphasis or inquiry. Over time, 「ぞえ」 contracted to 「ぜ」, inheriting its emphatic function.",

            "nuance": "「見ろ」 is an imperative form often used by males in casual speech. The use of 「ぜ」 adds emphasis to the exclamation, which is typical in male speech. If a woman were to say this, she would say 「見て！雪が降っているわよ！」."

            "nuance": "This sentence, using 「ぜ」, implies a casual and friendly invitation, typical between males or from a male to someone he knows well. The invitation 「行こう」 is a plain volitional form that indicates a casual tone. It would be more appropriate for a woman to say 「遊園地に行きましょう」.",
