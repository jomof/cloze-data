    "etymology": "「ず」 is the classical negative auxiliary verb, and 「とも」 means \"even if\". So, literally, 「ずとも」 means \"even if not\".",
    "writeup": "「ずとも」 is a formal expression that combines the classical negative auxiliary verb 「ず」 with the conjunction particle 「とも」, meaning \"even if\". It implies that regardless of whether something (A) is not the case, (B) still applies. This can translate to \"even if not (A), (B)\" or \"don't have to (A) to (B)\".\n\n*   It's attached to the ない-stem (negative stem) of verbs. For example, 「食べ**ずとも**」 (even if you don't eat).\n*   When expressing \"not being (A)\" rather than \"not doing (A)\", 「ならずとも」 follows a noun. This is the negated form of the verb 「なる」 (to become).\n*   「ずとも」 is formal but can be used sarcastically. It's often followed by 「良い」, meaning \"okay even if not (A)\".",
