  "writeup": "“という点から考えると (to iu ten kara kangaeru to)” is a set phrase indicating a discussion from a specific viewpoint.  It translates as “from the standpoint of,” “from the perspective of,” or “considering the point of.” The noun 点 (ten, point) highlights the specific aspect being focused on.  Literally, it means “if considered from the aspect of (A), (B).” This phrase often follows verbs or nouns.  When following nouns, の may replace という, particularly with simple nouns rather than longer quotations ending in a noun.  Interestingly, despite being a combination of the quotation particle と (to) and the -u verb 言う (iu, to say), という (to iu) is primarily written in hiragana and functions as a fixed expression signaling the need for further explanation.",
  "etymology": "The phrase is built upon two core elements:  という (to iu), a quoting particle and verb meaning roughly 'that being said,' and 点から考えると (ten kara kangaeru to), meaning 'to consider from the point of.' The combination creates a nuanced expression emphasizing the perspective from which an argument is presented.",
