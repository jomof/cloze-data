    "writeup": "The grammar point 「までだ」 indicates that something is \"just,\" \"merely,\" or \"simply\" the case. It's often used to express a sense of resignation or determination, suggesting that something is the only remaining option or the natural consequence of a situation. It typically follows a verb in dictionary form. It suggests a speaker's acceptance of a situation and willingness to proceed with the mentioned action as the only course available.",
    "etymology": "「まで」 indicates a limit or extent, and 「だ」 is the plain form of the copula 「です」, asserting the statement.  The combination suggests that the action is the extent of what is to be done.",
