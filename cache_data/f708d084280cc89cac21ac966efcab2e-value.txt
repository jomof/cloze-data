    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「禁じる (kinjiru)」, meaning \"to prohibit or restrain,\" and 「得ない (enai)」, indicating \"unable to obtain or do.\" Combined, they create a strong expression of being unable to suppress a feeling or action.",
    "writeup": "「を禁じ得ない」 is a highly formal grammar pattern indicating that one cannot help but feel a certain way or cannot restrain oneself from doing something. It's often used with words expressing emotions like joy, sorrow, or anger, or actions resulting from such emotions, such as tears or laughter. \n\nIt combines the adverbial particle 「を」, the conjunctive form of the verb 「禁じる」 (to prohibit), and 「得ない」, similar in meaning to 「できない」 (unable to do). It usually follows nouns or nominalized verbs (verbs turned into nouns using 「の」).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This pattern is generally used to express one's own feelings (first-person perspective). Using it for others might sound unnatural. For example, saying 「彼はあのシーンを見て涙を禁じ得ないようだ」 is grammatically correct but stylistically awkward because you are asserting you know what he feels.",
