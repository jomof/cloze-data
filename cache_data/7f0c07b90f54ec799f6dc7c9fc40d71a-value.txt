  "writeup": "The word あまり (amari) means \"excess\" or \"remainder.\"  However, in this grammatical construction, it functions as a phrase indicating an excessive degree leading to a negative consequence.  It's not inherently negative, but it's almost always used to describe situations where something is \"too much.\"  You attach あまり to the end of a phrase describing the excessive action or state, followed by another clause detailing the negative outcome.  The tense of the entire sentence depends on the verb or adjective in the first clause. Therefore, you'll see あまり used with various verb tenses.  Understanding this nuance is key to mastering its use.  This grammar point is standard usage.",
  "etymology": "The word あまり comes from the noun 余り (amari), meaning \"remainder\" or \"surplus.\" The modern usage as a grammatical particle to express \"so much that\" evolved from this original meaning of excess.  The feeling of an undesirable surplus is now implicit within the grammatical structure.",

      "conjugation": null,
