  "etymology": "のみならず is a fascinating combination of classical Japanese elements.  のみ is a particle meaning 'only' or 'just,' related to the modern だけ. ならず is the negative form of the verb なる (to become, to be), further emphasizing the 'not only' aspect.  The ず is a classical auxiliary verb indicating a continuing or sustained state.",
  "writeup": "のみならず (nominarazu) is a formal expression meaning \"not only...but also.\"  It's used to add a second point that extends or intensifies the first.  Think of it as a more sophisticated and emphatic version of  'not only A, but also B.'  This structure is **commonly found in formal writing and speeches**, rather than everyday conversation.  Its formality stems from its reliance on classical grammatical elements. The structure is inherently formal,  suitable for essays, official documents, or presentations.  Avoid using it in casual settings; doing so would sound unnatural and overly stiff.  It's crucial to maintain the formal tone of the surrounding text when employing のみならず. Because of its formality, it is unsuitable for use in intimate conversations.",

      "listener_gender": "female",
