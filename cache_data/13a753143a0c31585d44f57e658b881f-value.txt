  "writeup": "いらっしゃる is a crucial honorific verb in Japanese, showing respect for the person being discussed.  It's used to politely express 'to be,' 'to come,' or 'to go,' replacing いる, くる, and 行く, respectively.  The key is that it's *always* used when referring to someone of higher status or someone you wish to treat with deference.  Never use it to describe your own actions; that would be incredibly impolite.  The respectful perspective inherent in honorific language is why it works as a replacement for all three verbs—the speaker's position relative to the respected person determines the nuance.  We'll explore this subtle yet vital aspect of Japanese politeness in more detail later.  Simply substitute いらっしゃる for いる, くる, or 行く to form your sentences.  Interestingly, おいでになる serves a similar function and is often interchangeable with いらっしゃる.",

      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The use of \"よね\" is common amongst young women speaking casually to one another, signifying an agreement or shared feeling.  The politeness of \"いらっしゃる\" is somewhat softened due to the casual register and the close relationship between the speakers. 「よね」 indicates a close relationship, typical of younger women. "

      "conjugation": "polite non-past",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "This phrase, while using the polite \"いらっしゃる,\" gains a flirty tone through context and the implied intimacy.  The use of \"君\" is generally informal and appropriate between close friends. 「君」 signifies familiarity, lending itself to a flirtatious suggestion. The question is suggestive and the use of いらっしゃる adds politeness while not diminishing the overall intent."

      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The use of 「よ」 at the end is a common sentence ending among younger Japanese female speakers, especially when speaking in a more intimate setting.  The casual nature of 「よ」 adds to the intimacy and closeness implied in the sentence. This shows the speaker's enthusiasm and excitement about spending time with the listener."

Choosing between いらっしゃる and お～になる depends on the level of formality required; お～になる is generally more formal."
