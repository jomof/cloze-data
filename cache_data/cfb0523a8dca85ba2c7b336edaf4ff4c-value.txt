    "writeup": "「あげく」 (ageku) is a noun used to express a negative result that occurs despite a considerable amount of time, effort, or resources that were put into something. It suggests that the escalating situation somehow caused or prompted the negative result. 「あげく」 appears after the past-tense form of verbs or after nouns followed by 「の」.\n\n「あげく」 can also express a troublesome or negative process that led to a conclusion. In these cases, the outcome itself may not be undesirable, but arriving at that result was somehow difficult or unpleasant.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「あげく」 most often appears in hiragana, but the forms 「挙句」 and 「挙げ句」 are also common.\n*   The result described by 「あげく」 often carries a sense of unexpectedness or disappointment.",
