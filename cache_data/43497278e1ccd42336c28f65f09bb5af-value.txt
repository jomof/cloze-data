    "etymology": "The structure literally translates to 「whether or not」 「ない」 「内」 「に」, meaning \"within the state of not knowing whether something has happened or not.\" 「内 (uchi)」 here refers to a timeframe or a boundary within which an action occurs. The use of 「か」 emphasizes the uncertainty or immediacy between the potential action and its negation.",
    "writeup": "「か〜ないかのうちに」 is a somewhat formal grammar structure used to express that something happens almost immediately after something else. It conveys the idea that the action (B) occurs in the very short interval while it's uncertain whether action (A) has even started or finished. It often highlights the unexpected quickness of the occurrence of (B). The verb preceding 「か」 and 「ないか」 must be the same and in dictionary form. The structure implies \"right after,\" \"as soon as,\" or \"barely when.\"\n\nFor example, if you say 「ベルが鳴るかならないかのうちに、学生たちは教室から飛び出した」, it means \"As soon as the bell rang, the students rushed out of the classroom.\" It emphasizes how quickly the students reacted to the bell.",
