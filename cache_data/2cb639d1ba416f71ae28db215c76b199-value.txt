  },
  "pronunciation": {
    "katakana": "ところをみると",
    "romaji": "tokoro o miru to"
  },
  "etymology": "ところ (tokoro) means 'place,' 'aspect,' or 'point.' 見る (miru) means 'to see' or 'to look at.' と (to) is a conjunctive particle indicating a conditional or circumstantial clause.  The phrase's meaning arises from the combination of observing a particular aspect ('place') and then drawing a conclusion.  It's a naturally evolved expression reflecting the Japanese tendency to emphasize context and observation in forming judgments.",
  "writeup": "ところを見ると (tokoro o miruto) is a nuanced phrase used to express an inference or judgment based on observation.  It literally translates to \"seeing the situation,\" but conveys a more subtle meaning.  It suggests that the speaker is drawing a conclusion based on what they see or observe in a particular situation.  The structure is often followed by expressions of uncertainty or probability such as だろう (darou), かもしれない (kamoshirenai), etc., reflecting the inferential nature of the phrase.  This construction is used in standard Japanese across various contexts.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "彼がニコニコしている**ところを見ると**、テストに合格したに違いない。",
      "english": "Seeing that he's smiling, he must have passed the test.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「ニコニコしている」 (nikoniko shiteiru), a descriptive verb highlighting his happy demeanor, which forms the basis for the speaker's inference. The conclusion 「合格したに違いない」(goukaku shitani chigainai) expresses strong confidence, common in semi-formal situations."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼女は丁寧に話している**ところを見ると**、上品な方でしょう。",
      "english": "Judging from the way she speaks so politely, she must be a refined person.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「丁寧に話している」(teinei ni hanashiteiru) sets a formal tone, and 「上品な方でしょう」(jouhin na hou deshou) is a polite and somewhat indirect way of expressing an opinion, appropriate for formal settings. The overall politeness in both the observation and conclusion maintains a respectful distance."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼がいつも遅刻している**ところを見ると**、彼は時間を守ることができない人なのかもしれない。",
      "english": "Judging from his constant tardiness, he might be someone who can't keep time.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register is evident in 「いつも遅刻している」(itsumo chikoku shiteiru), a straightforward description of his habitual behavior, while the conclusion 「できない人なのかもしれない」(dekinai hito nano kamoshirenai) expresses uncertainty but still conveys the speaker's judgment. The overall tone is more relaxed."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの服を着ている**ところを見ると**、彼女は彼とデートするつもりなのかもね。",
      "english": "Judging by the clothes she's wearing, she's probably going on a date with him, don't you think?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The female speaker uses the sentence-ending particle 「ね」(ne) which is commonly used by women in casual settings to encourage agreement.  The phrase 「あの服を着ている」(ano fuku o kiteiru) sets the stage for the flirty speculation.  The implication that the listener shares the speaker's knowledge and judgment contributes to the casual and flirty nature."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "こんなに素敵な笑顔を見せてくれる**ところを見ると**、君といるのが楽しいんだね？",
      "english": "Seeing that you're showing me such a wonderful smile, you must be having fun with me, right?",
      "register": "shitashii kuchō",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「君」(kimi), a term of address usually used by males toward females, and the question ending 「ね」(ne) contribute to the intimate and flirty atmosphere.  The sentence relies on indirect communication, a common aspect of Japanese flirting, where subtle observation leads to suggestive inference. The phrase 「素敵な笑顔」(suteki na egao) hints at romance."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "こんなに素敵なレストランを選んでくれた**ところを見ると**、私を特別な存在として見てくれているのかな？",
      "english": "Seeing that you chose such a nice restaurant, I wonder if you see me as someone special?",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The sentence utilizes a semi-formal register, avoiding excessive familiarity while expressing subtle interest.  The use of 「私を特別な存在として」(watashi o tokubetsu na sonzai to shite), while suggesting romantic interest, allows for plausible deniability, a nuance often appreciated during early stages of romantic encounters. The sentence ends with 「のかな？」 (no kana?), softening the potentially assertive tone. "

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while ところを見ると suggests a conclusion, it's crucial to maintain a degree of humility, especially in formal settings.  Avoid using it for assertions of fact; it's best suited for gentle inferences and observations.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "からすると・からすれば",
      "meaning": "Judging from, Considering",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike ところを見ると, which emphasizes visual observation, からすると/からすれば is broader, encompassing various forms of evidence and inference."
    },
    {
      "term": "からして",
      "meaning": "Even..., Judging from, Based on",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "からして can mean 'even from...' indicating something is obvious, while also functioning similarly to ところを見ると.  However,  からして tends to express a more certain or definitive judgment than ところを見ると."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to distinguishing these phrases lies in the nuance of certainty and the type of evidence.  ところを見ると focuses on direct observation, implying a degree of uncertainty. からすると/からすれば are more general, and からして often indicates a more assured conclusion based on more than just visual cues. Choose the phrase that best reflects your level of confidence in your judgment and the nature of the evidence supporting it."
