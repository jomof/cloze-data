    "writeup": "**に限ったことではない** is a fairly emphatic expression. It uses the verb **限る (かぎる)**, meaning \"to limit\". The structure combines the particle **に**, the past tense of 限る (**限った**), the noun **こと** (\"thing\"), the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb **だ** (**で**), the topic particle **は**, and the negative い-adjective **ない**.  The literal translation is \"it is not something that is limited to (A)\". Common interpretations include \"not only (A), but (B)\", or \"not restricted to (A), (B) too\". This pattern follows nouns and is generally used in formal situations. It often suggests that (A) is not unusual and therefore doesn't require special treatment.",
