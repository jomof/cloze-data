  "writeup": "The Japanese particle combination たり～たりする is used to list actions or events without implying a specific order.  It's similar to using 'and' in English, but conveys a sense of \"things like this and that.\"  The final たり is typically followed by する (to do) in the non-past, or した (did) in the past tense.  Sometimes, you'll hear だり used instead of たり; this is a phonetic variation common with verbs that use だ in the plain past tense. This variation doesn't change the meaning.  It's often used when listing just a couple of activities, even if the speaker did more. Think of it as emphasizing the examples provided rather than claiming exhaustiveness.  The key difference from the て-form is that て implies a sequential order of events, while たり～たりする indicates a less structured, more casual collection of actions.  We'll look at various examples to demonstrate this nuance.",
  "etymology": "The particle たり comes from the 連用形 (ren'yōkei) or continuative form of verbs, often ending in -tari.  This form, when combined with する, creates a listing structure that expresses a non-sequential collection of actions, emphasizing the \"type\" of actions performed rather than their chronological order.  The structure has evolved into a casual and common way to list actions in everyday conversation.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the level of formality and the nuance of 'completeness' and 'sequence'.  たり～たりする emphasizes a non-sequential, descriptive list of actions, typically in a casual register.  The alternatives offer different shades of meaning, ranging from informal suggestions to emphatic lists or illustrative examples. Choosing the right particle depends on your intended meaning and the context of the conversation."
