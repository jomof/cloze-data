  "writeup": "たら最後 and たが最後 are grammar structures sharing the meaning 'once (A), definitely (B)'. (B) is always something negative, inevitably following action (A).  These translate as \"once (A), (B)\", \"now that (A), (B)\", or \"as soon as (A), (B)\".  Both たら and が function as conjunction particles. たら retains its usual 'if' or 'when' meaning, while が implies 'however' or 'but'.  Thus, たが最後 means '(A), but it will end up as (B)', while たら最後 means 'when (A), it will end up as (B)'.  The nuance is subtle, but they're used interchangeably.  Note that 最後, appearing before the comma, logically connects to the (B) part, indicating the 'final state'.\n\n**Caution:** Sometimes, (B) is omitted when the negative consequence is clear.",
  "etymology": "The term is built upon the conditional particle たら (tara, if/when) combined with 最後 (saigo, last/end/final).  The combination expresses a sense of inevitability, that the action of the first clause leads directly to the undesirable outcome of the second clause.  The use of が (ga) in the alternative form, たが最後 (taga saigo) adds a slightly contrastive nuance;  it highlights the contrast between the initial action and its ultimate negative result.",

      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",

      "english": "Once you sign a contract with that company, canceling it is an enormous hassle.",
      "register": "casual",

    {
      "japanese": "田中さんが話し始めたら**最後**、口が疲れるまでずっと話し続ける。",
      "english": "Once Tanaka-san starts talking, he keeps going until he's exhausted.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This again uses 「たら最後」, emphasizing that Tanaka-san's talking is unstoppable.  The humorous tone is evident in the image of him talking until exhaustion."

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「最後」 here creates a playfully suggestive and determined tone. The intimate register is crucial for conveying the playful, flirtatious nature of the statement. The female speaker uses the feminine phrasing 「わよ」 (wayo) to enhance this effect."

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence, while seemingly positive, uses 「最後」 subtly to convey the life-changing impact of meeting the listener. The polite register fits the early romantic context, where a woman might express her feelings in a manner not overly forward yet deeply expressive. The use of 「毎日が楽しくて仕方がない」 (mainichi ga tanoshikute shikatanai) is expressive of strong feelings without explicit romance."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the (B) clause often carries an implicit negative consequence.  The impact of たら最後 and たが最後 lies in the certainty and irreversibility it implies. The choice between たら and が is often stylistic, though が adds a nuance of contrast between the initial action and final state.",
