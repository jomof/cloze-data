  "writeup": "The particle も (mo) adds the nuance of 'also' or 'too' to a sentence.  When combined with である (de aru), a formal form of the copula だ (da), we get でもある (demo aru), meaning 'is also' or 'it also is.'  However, the use of も often implies something unexpected or additional information. Therefore, でもある is typically used to present an extra or surprising fact about something already mentioned.  Think of it as filling the role of 'B' in sentences like 'while A, it is also B' or 'in spite of A, it is also B.'  This grammatical structure is usually placed after nouns or な-adjectives.",
  "etymology": "The etymology is straightforward.  It's a combination of the particle も (mo, also), the copula である (de aru, is/am/are - formal), directly reflecting the meaning of 'also is'.  The unexpected or additional information nuance comes from the inherent nature of the particle も itself.",
