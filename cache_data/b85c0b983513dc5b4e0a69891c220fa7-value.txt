    "etymology": "のに originates from the particle の, which nominalizes a phrase, combined with the particle に, indicating a contrast or purpose. Over time, it evolved into a conjunction expressing unexpected results or circumstances.",
    "writeup": "のに expresses a sense of surprise or disappointment that the expected result did not occur. It conveys \"despite\" or \"even though.\" The basic structure is [clause 1] + のに + [clause 2], where clause 2 is contrary to what would be expected from clause 1.\n\n*   **Connecting to different word types:**\n    *   Verbs and い-adjectives connect directly to のに using their plain form.
    *   な-adjectives and nouns require な before のに. For example, 「静かなのに」 (despite being quiet) or 「雨なのに」 (despite the rain).",
