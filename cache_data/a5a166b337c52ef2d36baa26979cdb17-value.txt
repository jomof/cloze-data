  "writeup": "でございます is a polite copula, meaning it acts as a polite form of 'to be'.  It's used in formal situations and is considered more polite than です.  Think of it as the ultra-polite version of 'is' or 'am'.  While です is perfectly acceptable in many polite contexts, ごございます elevates the level of politeness significantly.  It's frequently used in formal introductions or when addressing someone of higher status.  Note that でござる, the less polite plain form of ごございます, is rarely used in modern Japanese, primarily seen in historical dramas or fictional situations.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of ごございます traces back to the archaic verb でござる.  The prefix ご is a polite honorific, and the suffix ます indicates politeness. Therefore, ごございます essentially combines a polite prefix, a verb stem, and a polite suffix to create an exceptionally polite form of the copula.",
