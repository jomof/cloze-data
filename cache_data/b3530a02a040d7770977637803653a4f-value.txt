    "etymology": "「ていた」 is formed by the te-form of a verb plus the past tense of the auxiliary verb 「いる」. 「いる」 originally meant \"to exist\" (animate things) but when attached to the te-form of a verb, it indicates the continuation of an action or a state.  Thus, 「て」 indicates the conjunctive form and 「いた」 signifies the past tense of this continuous state.",
    "writeup": "「ていた」 (or its polite form 「ていました」) expresses an action that was in progress in the past.  It's the past tense of the 「ています」 form, similar to the English \"was doing\".  This grammar point indicates that an action **was ongoing at a specific time in the past** or **continued for a period of time in the past**.  It can also describe a state that existed in the past, particularly with intransitive verbs.  Think of it as capturing a snapshot of an action or state that was happening or persisting before the present moment. Unlike the simple past tense, 「た」 form, which describes a completed action, 「ていた」 emphasizes the **duration or the process** of the action.",
