  "writeup": "で is a particle with multiple uses, but fundamentally highlights something 'required' for an action or goal.  One key use involves instruments or means, translating to 'by' or 'with' in English.  The item marked by で is considered essential, although alternatives might exist.  This also applies to groups:  で emphasizes a shared objective among group members, unlike と, where individual actions towards each other are primary.  Understanding this nuance is crucial, as both と and で can be rendered as 'with' in English.  The choice depends on whether the group works towards a collective goal (で) or interacts amongst themselves (と).",
  "etymology": "The particle で likely originated from the adverbial form of the verb である (to be). Over time, its function shifted from indicating location or existence to marking the instrument or means by which an action is performed.",

      "english": "I went to school by bicycle.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "storytelling",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The past tense 「行った」(itta) creates a casual and narrative tone. This is a standard way for someone to recount their past actions."

      "japanese": "彼**で**なければ、こんなことはできない。",
      "english": "If it weren't for him, I couldn't do this.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the conditional form 「なければ」(nakereba), which is more common in formal settings, along with the negative potential, indicating a higher degree of certainty in the speaker's assertion. The use of 「彼」(kare) is a neutral term used in both male and female speech."

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The 「ませんか」(masen ka) is a polite way to make a suggestion, but in this context, the implication of shared intimacy with 「二人で」(futari de) is unmistakable.  This flirty use of the particle is effective. The speaker (male) is initiating the romantic conversation, which is typical."

      "japanese": "私と一緒**で**、映画を見に行きませんか？",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion between these similar expressions, always consider the context.  If you're describing the method or tool used, で (by) is generally appropriate.  If you're specifying location, use で (at).  The compound structure offers a more nuanced way of expressing 'by' or 'with' particularly when describing processes. "
