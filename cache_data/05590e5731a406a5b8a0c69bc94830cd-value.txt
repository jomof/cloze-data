  "writeup": "つもりで (tsumori de), a combination of the noun つもり (tsumori, 'intention') and the particle で (de, 'with'), is a versatile grammatical structure with nuanced meanings. Its usage hinges on the preceding element. When used with verbs, な-adjectives, or nouns in their plain forms, it signifies that action (B) is undertaken with the intention of achieving (A).  Since つもり is a noun, の (no) is necessary when connecting it to other nouns, and な (na) is required when linking it to な-adjectives.  However, a crucial shift occurs when paired with past-tense verbs.  In this context, つもりで implies the speaker is 'acting as if (A)', 'pretending (A)', or 'believing (A) to be true', despite the reality being different. This meaning arises from the speaker's intention contrasting with the actual situation.",
  "etymology": "The term つもり (tsumori) originates from the verb つもる (tsumoru), meaning 'to accumulate' or 'to pile up.'  In this grammatical structure, it's a nominalized form, referring to the accumulation of an intention or plan.  The particle で (de) indicates the means or manner in which something is done, further highlighting the intentionality of the action.",
