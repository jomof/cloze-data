    "etymology": "The phrase どんなに〜ても combines どんな (donna), an adverbial form of the interrogative pronoun どう (dou) meaning \"how\" or \"in what way\", with the particle に (ni) to strengthen its adverbial function.  The ～ても (～temo) ending indicates a concessive condition, similar to \"even if\" or \"no matter\". Therefore, どんなに literally translates to \"in whatever way\" or \"however\", and when combined with ～ても, it creates the meaning \"no matter how\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **どんなに〜ても** expresses that a particular outcome remains the same regardless of the degree or extent of something.  Think of it as setting up a hypothetical scenario where something is pushed to its limit, but the result stays consistent.  It translates to \"no matter how\" in English.  The **どんなに** part can modify verbs, i-adjectives, and na-adjectives/nouns (which require **でも** instead of **ても**). It highlights the futility or inevitability of a situation despite significant effort or circumstance.",
