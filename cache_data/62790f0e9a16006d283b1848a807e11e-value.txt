    "etymology": "「誰」 comes from the verb 「タレル」 (tareru), meaning \"to hang down\" or \"to droop.\" In ancient times, the term was used to refer to someone insignificant or unknown, as if they were \"hanging down\" in status. Over time, it evolved to its current meaning of \"who,\" referring to an unknown person.",
    "writeup": "「誰」 (dare) is a pronoun used to ask \"who\" in Japanese. It functions as a substitute noun referring to people whose identity is unknown or unspecified. Depending on the particle used after 「誰」, the meaning can subtly change. For example:\n\n*   「誰が」 (dare ga): who (as the subject)\n*   「誰で」 (dare de):\n*   「誰に」 (dare ni): to whom\n*   「誰を」 (dare o): whom (as the object)\n*   「誰の」 (dare no): whose\n*   「誰か」 (dare ka): someone, somebody\n*   「誰でも」 (dare demo): anyone, everyone\n*   「誰も」 (dare mo): no one, nobody (when used with a negative verb)\n\nIn polite speech, 「どなた」 (donata) is used as a more honorific equivalent of 「誰」. 「どちら様」 (dochira-sama) is another polite expression used to inquire about someone's identity.",
