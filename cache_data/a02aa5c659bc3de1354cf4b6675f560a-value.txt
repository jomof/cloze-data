    "writeup": "The adverbial particle ばかり is combined with verbs in their dictionary form to indicate that something is the only thing occurring. It can also imply that something is happening \"more and more\" or that \"it keeps on\" happening. This usage of ばかり leverages its core meaning of \"only\" and combines it with the auxiliary verb だ (or です).  This pattern is often used with verbs describing some form of change, such as getting higher/lower, stronger/weaker, better/worse, faster/slower, etc.  To add a subsequent clause (B), the だ changes to its conjunctive form で.  \n\n**Important Consideration:** While frequently used with negative trends, this is not a strict grammatical rule, and it can also describe positive developments.",
