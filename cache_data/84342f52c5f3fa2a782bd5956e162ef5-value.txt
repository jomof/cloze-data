    "etymology": "あの shares its root with あれ (that over there) and あそこ (that place over there). All three point to something distant from both the speaker and the listener.",
    "writeup": "あの is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞, *rentaishi*) in Japanese. These words do not conjugate, meaning they always appear in the same form. あの comes from the same family of words as あれ and あそこ and is used to identify a 'thing' that is away from both the listener and the speaker. It is usually translated as \"that\" (thing over there). As the name 'pre-noun adjectival' suggests, these words always appear before a noun and describe that noun in some way.",
