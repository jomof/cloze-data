    "etymology": "The grammar point 「つつある」 is formed from 「つつ」, which means 'while' or 'as', and 「ある」, which means 'to be'. The combination suggests a state of being in the process of doing something.",
    "writeup": "When the particle 「つつ」 meaning \"while doing\" is combined with 「ある」 meaning \"to be\", it indicates that something is in the ongoing process of happening. The verb before 「つつ」 is in its ます-stem form. This formal grammar structure primarily highlights that something is slowly but surely continuing or changing. This 'change' often relates to an increase, decrease, expansion, contraction, or something similar. This pattern can be translated as 'to be -ing'. It's more formal than 「ている」. An important distinction is that 「つつある」 tends not to be used for noticeably physical motions, but rather highlights actions that indicate an ongoing state of change. This applies especially to verbs with an obvious end or completion point.",
