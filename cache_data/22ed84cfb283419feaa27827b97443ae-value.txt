    "etymology": "The 「て」 form originally evolved from the continuative form of verbs combined with the auxiliary verb 「つ」 (tsu), indicating completion or continuation. Over time, 「つ」 was omitted, and the 「て」 form became a versatile connector for various grammatical functions, including indicating sequential actions.",
    "writeup": "The **て form** of a verb, followed by another verb phrase, is often translated as \"then\" or \"and then\". This is how Japanese lists sequences of events that happen one after another. This grammar construction is used for listing things that happen in order, for example, \"I did (A), then (B), then (C)\". Other grammar structures will need to be used if you would like to talk about things that happen/happened in no particular order. For example, 「～たり～たりする」 appears in a sentence like \"I did things like (C), and (A), oh, and (B)!\"",
