    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ばこそ」 is used to emphasize the reason for something. It conveys the nuance that something is happening precisely *because* of a certain reason or condition. It often appears in formal speech or writing and adds a sense of emphasis or importance to the stated reason. A more casual but similarly-meaning version of this grammar point is 「からこそ」.",
    "etymology": "「ばこそ」 is derived from the conditional form 「～ば」 combined with 「こそ」, which is an emphasizing particle. The 「～ば」 form indicates a condition, and 「こそ」 adds emphasis, resulting in a structure that highlights the importance of the condition as the very reason for the subsequent statement.",
