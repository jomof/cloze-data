  "writeup": "にかかっている is a grammatical structure meaning \"to depend on (A)\" or \"to rest on (A)\".  It's a combination of the case-marking particle に and the ている continuous form of 懸かる (かかる), meaning \"to depend\" or \"to hang\". While it often attaches to nouns, it's frequently seen after set phrases like かどうか (\"whether or not\") and か否か (\"yes or no\").  The に in にかかっている can sometimes be replaced with 如何に (\"how\", \"in what way\", \"to what extent\"), subtly shifting the meaning to \"depending on the way in which (A)\" or \"depending on the extent to which (A)\".  Interestingly, 懸かる comes from the same verb family as 掛かる, 架かる, and 罹る—all sharing similar meanings but with nuanced differences. This highlights the beauty and complexity of Japanese verbs, where the same pronunciation can carry different subtle meanings based on the kanji used.  Mastering these nuances requires keen observation and practice.",
  "etymology": "The structure relies on the verb 懸かる (kakaru), meaning 'to depend on,' 'to hang,' or 'to be at stake.'  The kanji 懸 suggests something hanging or suspended, illustrating the dependence implied in the grammar point.  The ている form indicates a continuous state of dependence.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "来月旅行に行けるかどうかは、部長が僕に休みをくれるかに**かかっている**。",
      "english": "Whether I can go on the trip next month depends on whether my boss gives me time off.",

      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「部長」 (bucho), a relatively formal term for 'boss,' indicating a somewhat formal setting. The speaker is male, as indicated by the use of 「僕」 (boku)."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "私の進学は、奨学金の採択に**かかっている**。",
      "english": "My going to university depends on getting a scholarship.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The speaker uses 「私の進学」 (watashi no shingaku), a formal way of expressing 'my university studies' rather than simply 'going to university'. This contributes to the formality."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "君の幸せは、君の努力に**かかっている**よ。",
      "english": "Your happiness depends on your efforts.",

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「君」 (kimi) and the sentence-ending particle 「よ」 (yo) are distinctly casual, appropriate for a close relationship.  The use of 「努力」 (doryoku) is standard and not gendered."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "そのプロジェクトの成功は、チームワークにかかっている、と言わざるを得ない。",
      "english": "I have to say that the success of that project depends on teamwork.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The use of 「プロジェクト」 (purojekuto), a loanword, does not inherently reflect the speaker's gender.  The formality comes from the passive construction and overall tone."

    {
      "japanese": "彼の気持ちは、彼女の反応いかんに**かかっている**ようだ。",
      "english": "It seems his feelings depend on how she reacts.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The use of 「彼の気持ち」 (kare no kimochi) and 「彼女の反応」 (kanojo no hannoh) are neutral in terms of gender, while 「ようだ」 adds a layer of uncertainty and indirectness."

      "japanese": "今夜のデートの成功は、君の服装いかんに**かかっている**ぞ！",
      "english": "Tonight's date's success depends entirely on what you wear!",

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The sentence ending 「ぞ！」 (zo!) is emphatic and typical of casual, almost playful speech between close acquaintances. 「君の服装いかんに」 (kimi no fukusou ikan ni) indicates the dependence on one's clothing."

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The formality is evident in the use of 「プレゼンテーション」 (purezentēshon), a loanword frequently used in professional contexts, and the choice of words."

      "term": "次第だ・次第で",
      "meaning": "Depending on, So",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike にかかっている, which emphasizes a state of dependence, 次第だ/次第で suggests a more direct causal relationship, often implying a simpler, more immediate consequence."

      "meaning": "How, to what extent",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the degree of emphasis on the dependency.  にかかっている highlights the ongoing, perhaps even precarious, nature of the dependence.  次第だ/次第で and 如何 suggest a more straightforward, less precarious causal link.  Choosing the right expression hinges on the nuance you wish to convey—a subtle but significant distinction in conveying the weight of dependence."
