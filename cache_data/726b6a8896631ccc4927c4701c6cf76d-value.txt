    "etymology": "「と言おうか」 is derived from the particle 「と」 (used for quotations), the volitional form of the verb 「言う」 (いう, to say), and the question particle 「か」. Literally, it means something akin to 「Shall I say...?」, indicating the speaker is considering how to phrase something.",
    "writeup": "「といおうか」 is an expression that combines the case-marking particle 「と」 in its quotation use, the volitional form of the う-Verb 「言う」, 「言おう」 ‘to say’, and the adverbial particle 「か」 used for mid-sentence questions. It may be translated as ‘how to put it,’ or ‘perhaps it’s (A), or perhaps it’s (B).’ The more literal ‘shall I say it is (A), or shall I say it is (B)’ is also a common interpretation.\n\nThis expression will be used twice, where both the (A) and the (B) phrase are being questioned by the speaker. As with many other uses of 「と」 of a quotation, the preceding word may be almost anything. 「といおうか」 is interchangeable with the more common 「と言うか」, but it is advisable to only use it when specific emphasis needs to be made, or for some type of dramatic effect. In many cases, it will sound unnatural in daily speech.\n\n「と言おうか」 will frequently be used with fairly vague or imprecise descriptions, to avoid but hint at what the speaker actually wants to say. Often, this will be something negative.",
