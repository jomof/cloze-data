    "writeup": "ましょう is a conjugation of the auxiliary verb ます, and is a common polite way to suggest or invite someone to do something together. It can be translated as \"Let's (do something)\" or \"Shall we (do something)?\". To form it, attach ましょう to the ます-stem of a verb (the form you get when you drop ます from the polite form of the verb). Although it's often translated as \"Shall we (do something)?\", ましょう doesn't specifically target another person; it can also express the speaker's own determination to do something. This usage reflects the base meaning of ましょう as the polite volitional form, indicating a deliberate or purposeful action. In this case, the speaker is expressing their own intention to do something, similar to \"I shall\" in English, showing a strong resolution.",
    "etymology": "ましょう is derived from the auxiliary verb ます (masu), which indicates politeness, and the volitional ending う (ou), which expresses intention or suggestion. The combination creates a polite volitional form indicating \"let's\" or \"shall we.\"",
