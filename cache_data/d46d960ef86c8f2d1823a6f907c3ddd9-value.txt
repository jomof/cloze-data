    "etymology": "The verb いる (居る) originally meant \"to sit\" or \"to stay.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate the existence of animate beings. The particle が marks the subject that exists.",
    "writeup": "「がいる」 is a common construction formed by combining the particle 「が」 and the verb 「いる」. It means \"to exist\" or \"there is\" and is used to describe the existence of living or animate things.\n\nBecause these examples describe living things (or things operated by living beings), いる is the appropriate verb. 「ある」 is used for inanimate objects.\n\nThe polite form of 「いる」 is 「います」. Because 「いる」 removes the 「る」 in its polite conjugation, it is classified as a る-Verb (Ichidan verb).\n\nThe kanji form of 「居る」 is commonly used and should be learned early to avoid confusion while reading. There is no nuance difference between using the expression with or without kanji; it is up to the writer's preference.\n\n**Important Considerations**\nThe 「が」 in 「がいる」 is often omitted in casual speech or writing, such as in manga or instant messaging.",
