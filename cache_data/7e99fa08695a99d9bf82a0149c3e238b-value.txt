  "writeup": "たい is an auxiliary verb expressing desire.  It attaches to the masu-stem of verbs. The desired action can be marked with either を or が; が implies a stronger desire.  Like い-adjectives, たい conjugates for negative, past, and past-negative forms.  It's used to express *your* desires, or to repeat/ask about others' wants—not for guessing or commanding.  Note: たい isn't used for invitations;  ～ませんか is more natural.  Also, to express wanting someone *else* to do something, use ～てほしい.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of たい is complex and not fully understood, but it's likely related to other words expressing volition or desire.  It's a classic example of how Japanese grammar often relies on auxiliary verbs to express nuanced meanings.",
