    "writeup": "**結構 (けっこう)** primarily functions as an adverb meaning \"quite,\" \"rather,\" or \"fairly.\"  It indicates a degree that is more than average but not extremely high.  Interestingly, 「結構です (kekkou desu)」 is a common set phrase used to politely decline something, similar to \"no thank you\" or \"I'm fine, thanks.\"  This dual nature can be a little confusing for learners.  As an adverb, it modifies the adjective or verb that follows.  As a set phrase, it stands alone as a complete sentence.",

Also, remember that only 結構 is used in the set phrase 「結構です」 for polite refusal."
