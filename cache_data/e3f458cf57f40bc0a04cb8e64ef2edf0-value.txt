  "writeup": "The grammar point \"をよそに\" (wo yoso ni) signifies disregard or ignoring something.  It's a nuanced expression conveying that something is being brushed aside in favor of something else.  Think of it as 'despite (A), (B) happened' or '(B) happened, ignoring (A)'.  The structure combines the particle を (wo), the noun 余所 (yoso) meaning 'other place,' and the particle に (ni). Literally, it suggests putting something aside to focus on something else.  It generally follows nouns or noun phrases, often indicating a situation or circumstance being ignored or dismissed in favor of another action.  This construction tends toward formality, appearing more frequently in writing than in everyday conversation.  It's often used critically to describe actions perceived as irresponsible or inconsiderate, especially concerning the actions of others, and rarely the speaker's own actions.  The particle \"に\" indicates that the subject is being disregarded or brushed aside.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "彼は親の心配をよそに、毎晩夜遅くまで友達たちと遊んでいる。",
      "english": "He ignores his parents' worries and plays with his friends every night until late.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The sentence is semi-formal, as it avoids overly polite language but isn't overly casual either.  The action described, \"playing until late,\" is presented as a fact without strong judgment. The 「親の心配」 (oyano shinpai) is the disregarded factor, making it a matter-of-fact observation rather than a direct criticism."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "社長は社員の反対をよそに、仕事の効率を上げるために休憩所を撤去した。",
      "english": "The president disregarded his employees' objections and removed the break room to improve efficiency.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The formality is established through the use of the title 「社長」 (shachou) and the overall tone.  The action, removing the break room, is presented as a decision made despite opposition. The 「社員の反対」 (shain no hantai) is directly presented as the element being disregarded, leading to an impartial observation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "周囲の視線をよそに、彼は大胆にプロポーズした。",
      "english": "Ignoring the stares around him, he boldly proposed.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "storytelling",
      "nuance": "The description 「大胆にプロポーズした」(daitan ni puropozu shita) shows a confident and decisive act done in spite of external pressure. This is in line with the usage of をよそに.  The sentence is semi-formal; it could be used in casual settings but maintains a neutral, non-judgemental tone."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の冷たさをよそに、彼女は彼を愛し続けている。",
      "english": "Despite his coldness, she continues to love him.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "nuance": "This displays a perseverance despite challenges. The use of 「冷たさ」(tsumetakasa) in the context demonstrates a degree of emotional depth. The sentence is semi-formal; it conveys a thoughtful observation without being overtly sentimental or critical."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "世間の批判をよそに、彼女は自分の道を進み続けた。",
      "english": "Ignoring public criticism, she continued down her path.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "inspirational",
      "nuance": "The formality stems from the sentence's overall tone, emphasizing a resolute stance in the face of criticism. The 「世間の批判」(sekaino hihan), is the element directly disregarded, painting the subject as a strong and determined individual."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の嘘をよそに、彼女は彼を信じていた。",
      "english": "Despite his lies, she believed him.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "storytelling",
      "nuance": "This is casual in tone, focusing on the naiveté of belief in spite of evidence to the contrary. The focus is on her actions. The 「彼の嘘」(kare no uso) being disregarded heightens the dramatic irony. "
    },
        {
      "japanese": "周りの目をよそに、二人だけの世界に浸っていた。",
      "english": "Ignoring the eyes of those around them, they were lost in their own world.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "nuance": "This sentence is casual, suggesting intimacy.  The 「周りの目」(mawari no me) is disregarded, highlighting their focus on each other.  The implication of a shared, intimate moment adds to the flirty nuance.",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female"
    }
  ],
  "etymology": "余所 (yoso) originally meant 'another place' or 'elsewhere.'  The use of をよそに extends this meaning to suggest ignoring or setting aside something as if it were in another, irrelevant place.  The combination with を (direct object marker) and に (indicating direction or purpose) creates the nuanced sense of deliberate disregard."
