    "etymology": "The phrase 「うちに」 literally means \"within\" or \"while inside\". When combined with the 「ない」 negative form of a verb, it creates the nuance of taking action or a change occurring before a certain negative event or state comes to pass. It's often used to emphasize the importance of acting promptly to avoid an undesirable outcome.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ないうちに」 expresses the idea of \"before\" something happens or \"while\" a certain state still exists. However, unlike 「うちに」 alone, 「ないうちに」 carries a nuance of preventing an unfavorable result. It implies that if action isn't taken, something negative will occur. Think of it as using the time *before* something bad happens to your advantage. This grammar point is commonly used in everyday speech.",
