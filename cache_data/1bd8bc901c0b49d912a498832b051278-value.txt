    "writeup": "Stemming from the verb 責める (semeru), meaning \"to blame\" or \"to press someone to do something,\" せめて (semete) is an adverb that indicates the minimum expectation or condition necessary to achieve a desired outcome or to express a sense of dissatisfaction with the current situation. It often conveys the idea that while the ideal is not attainable, this minimal action or condition is still necessary or desirable.  Think of it as the bare minimum required or the least one can hope for. It's frequently used with expressions of desire (たい, ほしい), obligation (べき), or when expressing a complaint or regret.",
