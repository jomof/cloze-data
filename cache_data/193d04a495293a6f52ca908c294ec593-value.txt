  "writeup": "The adverbial phrase も又 (mo mata) translates to \"too,\" \"also,\" or \"again,\" conveying a stronger emphasis than も (mo) alone.  It signifies an additional point worthy of consideration, often presented as a counterpoint or further elaboration.  It typically follows nouns or noun phrases, highlighting the significance of the preceding element.  The element preceded by もまた is emphasized as the primary point, even if a contrasting viewpoint is present in the sentence. Notably, もまた is primarily written in hiragana, reinforcing its slightly informal yet emphatic nature.  Consider it a more forceful version of も.",
  "etymology": "も (mo) is a particle indicating emphasis or inclusion. 又 (mata) means 'again' or 'also'.  Their combination creates a more emphatic and formal way to express 'also' or 'too'. The formality stems from the use of 又, a more classical word compared to other alternatives.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while もまた can add emphasis, overuse can sound unnatural. Choose your words carefully, especially in formal contexts.  Context is vital; even in formal settings, a slight change in tone can make もまた sound more natural. Consider the surrounding words and the overall tone of your conversation.",
