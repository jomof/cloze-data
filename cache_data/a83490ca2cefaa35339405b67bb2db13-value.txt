    },
    "etymology": "一応 (ichiō) is composed of two kanji: 一 (ichi) meaning \"one\" and 応 (ō) meaning \"to answer\" or \"to respond\".  The combination suggests doing something \"for the time being\" or as a \"temporary response\" to a need or situation, implying a minimum level of action or fulfillment.",
    "writeup": "一応 (ichiō), when used adverbially, indicates that something is done to a minimal acceptable level or for the immediate moment. It carries the nuance that while the action isn't perfect or fully comprehensive, it meets the basic requirement or addresses the situation for now.  Think of it as \"more or less,\" \"for the time being,\" or \"tentatively.\" The emphasis is on fulfilling a requirement, often related to time or quantity. This contrasts with the other common usage of 一応 meaning \"just in case,\" where the action is taken as a precaution.  In both cases, the core idea is fulfilling a basic need or requirement.",

            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "professional",
            "nuance": "The use of 「～ますが」 at the end makes the sentence polite and suitable for a professional setting. Saying 「一応私が店長ですが」 implies the speaker acknowledges they are the manager, though perhaps with some reservation or qualification.",
            "etymology": "The use of 「店長 (tenchō)」, meaning 'store manager', reflects the professional setting."

            "japanese": "今日は一応ここまでにしておきましょう。",

            "register": "semi-formal",
            "setting": "professional",
            "nuance": "「～にしておきましょう」 is a common polite expression for suggesting a course of action. 「一応ここまで」 indicates that this is a temporary stopping point, not necessarily the final one.",
            "etymology": "「まで (made)」 indicates a limit or endpoint."

            "setting": "informative",
            "speaker_gender": "male",
            "nuance": "The speaker uses the casual 「僕 (boku)」 to refer to himself. 「立った (tatta)」 is the past tense of the verb 'to stand'. 「一応立った」 suggests he stood up because others did, not necessarily out of a clear personal reason.",
            "etymology": "The verb 「立つ (tatsu)」 means 'to stand'."

            "listener_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "「～な」 is a casual sentence ending often used by males. 「一応」 here shifts to the \"just in case\" meaning, showing the dual nature of the word. The speaker is advising the listener to bring a jacket as a precaution.",
            "etymology": "「ジャケット (jaketto)」 is a loanword from English."

            "nuance": "The 「～けど」 softens the statement, and the 「～からね」 adds a touch of emphasis or explanation, common in female speech. 「一応言っておく」 means 'I'm telling you just in case/just to be sure'.",
            "etymology": "The verb 「言う (iu)」 means 'to say'."
