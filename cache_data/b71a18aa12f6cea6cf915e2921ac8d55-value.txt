    "etymology": "The 「から」 part means \"because,\" and 「こそ」 is an adverbial particle used to emphasize the preceding word or phrase. The combination creates an emphatic \"precisely because.\"",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle 「こそ」 is traditionally used to emphasize a noun or noun phrase. When combined with the conjunction particle 「から」, it strongly emphasizes the reason for something. It's akin to saying \"precisely because (A)\" in English. 「からこそ」 typically follows verbs or nouns. When used with nouns, the auxiliary verb 「だ」 is required before adding 「からこそ」. While there might be multiple reasons for something, 「こそ」 highlights the most important one.",
