    "etymology": "まさか is formed from まさ (masa), related to the noun 正 (masa, \"precise\" or \"actual\"), and the question particle か (ka).  Literally, it carries a sense of \"Is it precise/actual?\".",
    "writeup": "まさか is predominantly written in hiragana. It functions as an adverb expressing **strong disbelief, surprise, or shock** regarding a certain possibility or statement. Think of it as a more emphatic version of saying something is unbelievable. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence. While まさ (masa) stems from 正 meaning \"precise\" or \"actual\", and is related to the adverb まさに (masani) meaning \"precisely\",  まさか conveys the opposite sentiment, questioning the actuality of something.  It’s a versatile word used across different age groups and genders.",
