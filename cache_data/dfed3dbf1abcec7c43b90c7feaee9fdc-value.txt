  "writeup": "The adverb なお (nao), meaning \"in addition,\" \"incidentally,\" \"furthermore,\" or \"moreover,\" adds information to a previously stated point.  It's typically used at the beginning of a sentence, often following a sentence or clause establishing a base fact or situation.  The information introduced by なお often adds a surprising or unexpected element.  While it can be used positively or negatively, its core function is to highlight the new information as exceeding expectations, given the previous context.  You'll almost always see it written in hiragana, not kanji, reflecting its common usage in modern Japanese.  Because of its formal register, it's frequently found in formal settings like letters, posters, and commercials, rather than casual conversation.",
  "etymology": "尚 (nao) is composed of 上 (ue, meaning 'above', 'on top of') and 尚 (nao, a character having a similar meaning to 'furthermore', 'still more'). The character combination therefore literally implies 'furthermore', 'in addition', or 'even more'. The evolution of this formal word suggests that its current usage has been passed down from classical Japanese through centuries of formal writing and speech.",

      "listener_gender": "female",

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the nuance of なお shifts subtly depending on context. In formal settings, it emphasizes the importance of additional information. In more casual settings, it can feel like a friendly addition or reminder.  Mastering this subtle shift is key to sounding natural.",
