    "etymology": "The particle 「と」, in its quotative function, originates from the verb 「言う (いう)」, meaning \"to say.\" Over time, it evolved into a particle used to mark direct quotations or to express content.",
    "writeup": "One of the regular functions of 「と」 in Japanese is as a quotation particle. This use is called 「引用 (いんよう)」 in Japanese, which basically translates as \"reference\" or \"citation.\" This way of using 「と」 can appear after almost any type of word or phrase but requires 「だ」 when used after nouns or 「な」-Adjectives. As a quotation marker, 「と」 will almost always be followed by a verb that shows what type of \"quote\" it is. This can be words like 「言う (いう)」, 「思う (おもう)」, 「考える (かんがえる)」, 「聞く (きく)」, etc. However, at the end of a sentence, the verb will often be omitted. As with other instances of the particle 「と」 being used, this use simply expresses the relationship between (A) \"what was communicated\" and (B) \"how it was communicated.\"",
