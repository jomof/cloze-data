  "writeup": "The volitional form using よう (and its variant う) is a casual way to express suggestions ('let's') or intentions ('I shall').  It's the informal counterpart to the polite ましょう.  Understanding its nuances requires appreciating that it's not a single conjugation but rather a pattern applied differently to う-verbs, る-verbs, する, and くる.  For う-verbs, the final vowel changes (e.g., 行く becomes 行こう).  For る-verbs, る changes to よう (e.g., 食べる becomes 食べよう). する becomes しよう, and くる becomes こよう. This form can express conjecture, intentions, or invitations, mirroring the functions of だろう, ～するつもりだ, and 誘う respectively.  It's crucial to distinguish よう from ようだ, which expresses resemblance.  While both use よう, their meanings are vastly different.  よう denotes volition, while ようだ expresses similarity or appearance.",
  "etymology": "The volitional form よう derives from the ancient verb よう (to want).  Its evolution reflects the grammatical simplification and natural shifts that have shaped modern Japanese.",
