    "writeup": "に反して, formed by combining に and the て-form of 反する (hansuru), meaning \"to oppose\" or \"to go against,\" is used to introduce a statement that contradicts or goes against a previous statement, expectation, rule, or generally accepted idea. It can be translated as \"contrary to (A), (B)\" or \"going against (A), (B).\"  に反して follows a noun. A related form, に反する, directly modifies the following noun. Unlike に対して, に反して often highlights a discrepancy between a prediction or expectation and the actual outcome. This grammar point is considered formal and is frequently found in written materials, official documents, and speeches.",
