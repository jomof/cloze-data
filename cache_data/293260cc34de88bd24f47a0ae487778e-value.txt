  "writeup": "The expression てほしい (te hoshii) is a versatile way to express a desire for someone to perform an action.  It's built upon the fundamental concept of ほしい (hoshii), meaning 'to want,' but elevates it by attaching it to the te-form of a verb. This subtly shifts the focus from wanting an *object* (as in がほしい) to wanting an *action* to be performed.  Think of it as a polite and often indirect way of making a request. The te-form adds flexibility, allowing you to express a wide range of desires.  Note that while generally polite, the level of politeness can subtly shift based on context and the overall sentence structure.",
  "etymology": "てほしい combines the て-form (a versatile verb conjugation indicating completion or connection) with ほしい (hoshii), deriving from the verb 欲する (hossuru), meaning 'to desire' or 'to want.'  The combination elegantly blends the action to be performed (て-form) with the speaker's desire for that action to occur (ほしい).",

      "speaker_gender": "male",

      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The choice of 「私と一緒に」 (watashi to issho ni) emphasizes the speaker's desire for companionship. The listener's gender plays a crucial role. A female speaker using this phrase with a male listener implies a romantic interest, adding a soft, subtly suggestive layer to the sentence. "

      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The trailing 「な…」 adds a touch of vulnerability and longing. The sentence's intimacy is highlighted by the direct and emotional expression of desire, common in very close relationships.  The use of 「優しく」 (yasashiku), meaning 'gently', further reinforces the intimate tone."

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "Distinguishing between these similar expressions hinges on understanding the subject of the desire.  Is it the speaker wanting to do something (たい), wanting an object (がほしい), someone else wanting something (たがる, がる), or wanting a specific way of action (ように～てほしい)?  てほしい clearly expresses the speaker's desire for another person to perform a particular action."
