    "writeup": "「折(に)」 is a formal expression used to describe a particular occasion, time, or opportunity, often implying a special or desirable event. It's more common in formal writing and speech. The nuance suggests taking advantage of the moment or when something desirable takes place. It can follow a noun + 「の」, a verb in its informal form, an い-adjective in its informal non-past form, or a な-adjective stem + 「な」.  You might hear 「その折に」, meaning \"on that occasion.\"",
