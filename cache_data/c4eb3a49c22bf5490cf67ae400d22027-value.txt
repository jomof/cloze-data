    "writeup": "上に (ue ni) is used to express that something is \"in addition to\" or \"besides\" something else. Think of it as saying \"on top of\" something, adding more information or qualities. It's a slightly formal way of saying \"and\". Crucially, 上に is used to highlight qualities that are similar in nature, such as adding a positive trait to another positive trait, or a negative trait to another negative trait. \n\n*   It connects verbs and い-adjectives in their plain form directly to 上に.\n*   な-adjectives are followed by な before 上に (e.g., 静かな上に).\n*   Nouns are followed by の before 上に (e.g., 勉強の上に), or である (e.g., 学生である上に). The に can sometimes be dropped, but it's more common to include it.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   上に implies that the items being connected are related or of similar nature. You would not typically use it to connect completely unrelated things.\n*   上に can sometimes sound unnatural if used to connect contradictory attributes (e.g., \"He is handsome, and also rude\"). It's more natural when connecting similar attributes (e.g., \"He is handsome, and also kind\").",
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「上に」 can be understood by breaking it down. 「上」 means \"above\" or \"on top,\" and 「に」 is a particle indicating location or direction. Therefore, 「上に」 literally means \"on top of\" something. This conveys the sense of adding something more to what is already there, similar to adding another layer on top of an existing one.",
