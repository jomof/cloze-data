  "writeup": "はともかく is a versatile expression used to shift focus or prioritize one aspect over another.  It literally uses the topic-marking particle は and the adverb 兎も角 (usagi mo kakubeku), meaning 'at any rate' or 'in any case'.  This construction allows you to downplay a less important point (A) while highlighting the more significant point (B).  It's typically used after nouns in their dictionary form. Often, (A) represents something the speaker deems inconsequential compared to (B). The nuance often implies a dismissal or a redirection of attention.  The expression is frequently employed when the speaker doesn't want to dwell on (A) because (B) is of greater relevance or urgency.  An interesting etymological note: 兎も角 is believed to originate from the Buddhist expression 兎角亀毛, meaning 'rabbit horns, turtle hair,' referring to nonexistent things. While the direct connection to the modern meaning isn't universally accepted, it highlights a shared sense of referring to something insignificant or irrelevant.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "この料理の見た目はともかく、味はとてもいい。",
      "english": "Apart from the appearance of this dish, the taste is very good.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses はともかく to set aside the visual aspect of the dish, focusing on the superior taste.  The sentence is semi-formal due to the choice of vocabulary and politeness level. The setting is informative, as it directly describes a dish's qualities."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "家賃が高いか安いかはともかく、東京駅の近くに住みたい。",
      "english": "Whether the rent is high or low is beside the point; I want to live near Tokyo Station.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "nuance": "The speaker prioritizes proximity to Tokyo Station over rent cost, using はともかく to dismiss the latter point. The casual register is apparent in the straightforward sentence structure and the use of the plain form of the verb 住みたい (sumetai)."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "給料はともかく、やりがいのある仕事がしたい。",
      "english": "Salary aside, I want a rewarding job.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "nuance": "This prioritizes job satisfaction over salary. The semi-formal register suits a job application or interview.  The phrase 「給料はともかく」 (kyūryō wa to mo kaku) makes the salary less important and the job itself more important."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "美人か美人じゃないかはともかく、優しくて料理が上手な人と結婚したい。",
      "english": "Whether she's beautiful or not is irrelevant; I want to marry someone kind and a good cook.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "nuance": "This prioritizes personality and skills over appearance. The casual register reflects personal thoughts and preferences. The sentence structure is simple and casual. The expression 「美人か美人じゃないかはともかく」(bijin ka bijin ja nai ka wa to mo kaku) indicates that outward appearance isn't important."

    {
      "japanese": "このスマホのデザインはともかく、機能性は抜群だ。",

      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "persuasive",
      "nuance": "This emphasizes functionality over design, suitable for a product review or sales pitch.  The use of 「このスマホのデザインはともかく」(kono sumaho no dezain wa tomo kaku) explicitly disregards the design, focusing the argument on functionality."

    {
      "japanese": "君のことはともかく、僕は明日、新しい仕事に就くんだ。",
      "english": "Leaving you aside, I'm starting a new job tomorrow.",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses 「君のことはともかく」(kimi no koto wa tomo kaku) to dismiss the listener, highlighting the speaker's personal accomplishment. The phrase 「君のこと」(kimi no koto) is a casual way to refer to 'you,' and is frequently used by males to females. The casual register and the setting being flirtatious shows off the speaker's arrogance, yet this might be seen as attractive to some listeners."

    {
      "japanese": "お金持ちかどうかはともかく、あなたと一緒なら幸せになれる気がする。",
      "english": "Whether or not he's rich is irrelevant; I feel I can be happy with you.",

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "This sentence shows prioritizing feelings over material wealth, using intimate language. 「あなたと一緒なら」(anata to issho nara) is a very intimate way for females to address the listener. The phrase 「お金持ちかどうかはともかく」(okane mochi ka dō ka wa tomo kaku) suggests the speaker is less concerned about their financial status."

  ],
  "etymology": "The adverb 兎も角 (usagi mo kakubeku) is believed to have roots in the Buddhist expression 兎角亀毛 (usagi kaku kamege), meaning 'rabbit horns, turtle hair,' highlighting the absurdity of focusing on things that don't exist. This links to the modern usage of 兎も角, emphasizing the dismissal of less relevant points.  However, the precise etymological connection isn't fully established, leading to continued debate among linguists.",

      "kind": "synonym",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the degree of emphasis and politeness. はともかく carries a stronger implication of dismissal or downplaying, making it suitable for casual or semi-formal contexts where a decisive shift in focus is needed.  The other expressions offer more neutral or formal alternatives, with varying degrees of formality and suitability for different communication styles.  Choose the expression that best matches the desired tone and context of your statement."
