  "writeup": "The Japanese grammar point \"をもって\" (motte) is a formal expression typically used in official documents, announcements, and formal speeches.  It indicates a point in time or an event from which something else begins or ends. When used with time-related expressions, it's often translated as \"as of\" or \"effective from.\"  It's a combination of the particle \"を\" (wo) and \"もって\" (motte), which means \"by means of.\"  The nuance emphasizes the conclusion or completion of a preceding period, not necessarily the commencement of a new one. While 'effective from' might suggest a starting point in English,  \"をもって\" focuses on the *ending* or culmination of a period. Therefore, you wouldn't use it to mark the beginning of something entirely new, lacking any significant prior events.  Its formal register makes it unsuitable for casual conversation.  The form \"をもちまして\" (wo mochimashite) is a polite variant often used in formal situations.  Occasionally, the small \"っ\" (sokuon) is omitted, resulting in \"をもて\" (wo mote), though less common. The etymology traces back to the kanji 以て (ite), with \"もって\" (motte) originally stemming from \"持つ\" (motsu) meaning \"to hold\" or \"to have,\" lending it the sense of \"having reached\" or \"possessing\" something until the specified time.",

  ],
  "etymology": "The etymology of \"をもって\" is fascinating.  It's derived from the verb \"持つ\" (motsu), meaning \"to hold\" or \"to possess.\"  The particle \"を\" (wo) indicates that the preceding noun is the means or instrument. Thus, \"をもって\" signifies \"by means of,\" or \"with.\" Its formal usage reflects the original sense of holding or possessing something until a specific point in time."
