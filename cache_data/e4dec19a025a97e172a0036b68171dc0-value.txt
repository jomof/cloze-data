  "writeup": "The particle との (との) is a fascinating compound, formed by combining the quotative particle と (to) and the possessive particle の (no).  This creates a nuanced construction where the preceding clause is presented as reported information,  followed by a noun specifying the *nature* of that information.  Think of it as saying 'the fact that…' or 'the report that…',  or even a more indirect 'it's said that…'. The nuance lies in presenting the information indirectly, adding a layer of distance or uncertainty. It’s frequently used in formal settings or when conveying information from an external source.  You'll find it particularly useful when reporting news, rumors, opinions, or official pronouncements.",
  "etymology": "との (tono) is a combination of two particles: と (to), which in this context functions as a quotative marker, signifying that the preceding statement is a quote or reported speech, and の (no), the possessive particle, indicating possession or attribution. The combination creates a structure that suggests the information is indirectly sourced or reported.",

      "english": "There was a broadcast **that** a kidnapping incident occurred in this area, but the perpetrator's characteristics were not broadcast.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the particle 「との」 to indicate reported information from a broadcast.  The passive voice 「放送されなかった」 further emphasizes the indirect nature of the information."

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "interrogative",

      "register": "formal",

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how との subtly shifts the emphasis and adds a layer of indirectness to the reported information.  This can be critical in conveying news, opinions, or other information without explicitly endorsing or taking ownership of the statement.",
