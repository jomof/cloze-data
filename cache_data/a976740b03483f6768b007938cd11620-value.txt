  "writeup": "僅かに (wazukani) is a crucial adverbial form derived from the na-adjective 僅か (wazuka), meaning \"only,\" \"slightly,\" \"a little,\" \"barely,\" or \"merely.\"  It's used to emphasize the smallness or insignificance of something.  The nuance is often one of modesty, understatement, or even a hint of disappointment that the quantity or degree is so limited.  It's common in standard Japanese and used across various contexts.  Think of it as highlighting a quantity or degree so small that it's almost negligible.  While 僅か can function as a noun (\"a trifle\"), 僅かに is almost exclusively adverbial, typically appearing at the sentence's beginning.  Mastering its subtle shades of meaning will elevate your Japanese expressiveness.",
  "etymology": "The term 僅か (wazuka) is thought to have originated from a compound of words related to 'smallness' or 'meagerness'. The exact etymology is debated but its usage highlights a long-standing focus on subtle quantifications within Japanese culture.",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate, consider the context.  たったの emphasizes a surprising smallness; 僅かに suggests a more understated, perhaps even less impactful smallness.  The choice depends on the nuance you wish to convey."
