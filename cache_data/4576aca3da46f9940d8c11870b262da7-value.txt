    "etymology": "The term 「ください」 comes from the honorific verb 「くださる」, which is the polite equivalent of 「くれる」 (to give). Thus, 「てください」 literally implies receiving the favor of someone doing something for you. Consider it the polite imperative form of くださる, with the underlying meaning of politely requesting the action.",
    "writeup": "「てください」 is a polite expression used for asking someone to do something. It's typically translated as \"please do (A).\" 「ください」 itself is classified as honorific language, a form of polite speech used to refer to others' actions. 「くださる」 is the base form of this verb and serves as the honorific equivalent of 「くれる」. While 「ください」 is used exclusively for making requests, 「くださる」 has broader usage. Note that in friendly conversation, 「ください」 may be omitted, leaving the 「て」 form as a very casual way of saying \"please do (A).\"",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "「てください」 is a versatile way to make polite requests in Japanese. However, it's essential to choose the right expression based on the context and your relationship with the person you're addressing. While 「な」 and 「ないでください」 are used to prohibit actions, 「お〜願う」, 「てごらん」, and 「お〜ください」 offer alternative ways to make requests with varying levels of formality. Also, note the subtle differences between requests. Is it something you are asking a favor with 「〜ていただけませんか」, or just a regular request 「〜てください」, or a casual request 「〜て」",
