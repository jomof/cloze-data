    "etymology": "The grammar point is derived from the particle 「か」 (used to indicate uncertainty or a question), the verb 「思う」 (omou, to think), and the conditional forms 「たら」 (tara) and 「と」 (to). It combines these elements to express a sense of surprise or a rapid change in circumstances immediately following an initial thought.",
    "writeup": "「かと思ったら」 and 「かと思うと」 are used to express a sense of surprise or a rapid change of events immediately after a thought or action. The literal meaning is close to \"before (A) could even be confirmed as having happened, (B).\" Essentially, it conveys that just when you thought something was going to happen or was a certain way, something else occurred instead. 「かと思うと」 and 「かと思ったら」 often appear after verbs in either their dictionary or past-tense forms.\n\n*   **かと思ったら (ka to omottara):** Past tense form, emphasizing that the first action or state had already occurred or was assumed to have occurred.\n*   **かと思うと (ka to omou to):** Present tense form, indicating a more immediate reaction or realization.\n\nThis grammar is commonly used in everyday speech and writing to express unexpected events or changes.",
