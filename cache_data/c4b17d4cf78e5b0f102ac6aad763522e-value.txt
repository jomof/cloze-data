  "writeup": "The particle 各 (kaku) is a useful word to express 'each,' 'every,' or 'respective.'  It's often, though not exclusively, used before nouns of Chinese origin (kanji compounds) or katakana words. While versatile, it's less common for units of time.  Its most natural use highlights items within a sequence or set. Think: each stop on a train line, each page in a book, each floor in a building.  Knowing when to use 各 versus other words signifying 'each' is important for sounding natural.  For example, 各々 (kakaku) also means 'each,' but primarily refers to people, adding a nuance of individuality. This adds a layer of complexity to the seemingly simple concept of 'each'.  Mastering 各 allows for a more sophisticated and nuanced expression of quantity and individuality in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The character 各 (kaku) is composed of the radicals 各 (kaku, each) and 々 (kaku, respectively). It's visually related to other characters conveying the idea of separateness or distinct units.  Understanding these visual components reinforces its meaning.",
