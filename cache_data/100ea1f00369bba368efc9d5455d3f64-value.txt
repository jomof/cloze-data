    "writeup": "The verb する is a fundamental verb meaning \"to do\" or \"to make into\".  It's one of the few irregular verbs in Japanese, belonging to the さ-column irregular conjugation group. This means its conjugation pattern is unique. Instead of the usual rules for う-verbs or る-verbs, the final 「る」 is dropped, and the stem 「し」 or 「さ」 is used for different conjugations.  For instance, the polite form is 「します」, the negative form is 「しない」, and the past form is 「した」.  Often, する is used with a noun to create a verb, like 「勉強をする」 (to study) or 「掃除をする」 (to clean).  Think of する as applying an action or transforming something into a certain state. In a broad sense, する can be thought of as meaning \"to do something that has an external effect\".",
