    "etymology": "The expression 「ふりをする」 comes from the noun 「振り (furi)」, meaning \"appearance\" or \"semblance\", the particle 「を (o)」, and the verb 「する (suru)」, meaning \"to do\". The literal sense is \"to do the appearance of,\" which implies pretending or acting as if something is the case.",
    "writeup": "「ふりをする」 is a Japanese expression used to convey that someone is \"pretending to be (A)\", \"putting on airs of (A)\", or \"acting as if (A)\". It combines the noun 「振り (furi)」, meaning \"appearance\" or \"semblance,\" the particle 「を (o)」, and the verb 「する (suru)」, \"to do.\" Think of it as meaning \"to give off the impression of (A)\" or \"to make a show of (A)\".\n\nSince 「ふり」 is a noun, this expression can be used with the attributive form of any other word to describe what one is pretending to be or do.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「ふり」 itself has several nuances, but in this context, it refers to showing a certain behavior on the outside. It doesn't necessarily mean outright \"pretending,\" but rather that the external behavior might differ from the internal state.",
