    "writeup": "**ついでに** is an adverb in Japanese that functions similarly to \"while you're at it\" or \"on the occasion of (A)\" in English.  The noun **序（ついで）** itself means \"precedence\" or \"order of things.\"  Therefore, the literal sense of **ついでに** could be understood as \"with (A) as the initial action, (B) as a secondary action.\"

    **Key Points:**

    *   **Secondary Action:**  **ついでに** indicates that action (B) is done in addition to or alongside the primary action (A). Action (A) is usually the reason or opportunity for action (B).
    *   **Convenience:** It often implies that doing (B) is convenient because (A) is already happening.
    *   **Formality:**  **ついでに** is more formal than **間に（あいだに）** or **時に（ときに）**, and thus is often used for single, non-recurring events. However, it can still be used for regular occurrences, especially in more formal or polite settings.
    *   **Usage:** It's commonly used with verbs or nouns. When used with a noun, it requires the particle **の** before it (e.g., 散歩のついでに - while on a walk).",
