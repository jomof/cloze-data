  "writeup": "The grammar point \"にかこつけて\" (ni kakatsukete) is a nuanced expression built upon the particle \"に\" (ni) and the verb \"かこつける\" (kakatsukeru), meaning \"to use as a pretext.\"  It's often translated as \"in the name of,\" \"under the pretense of,\" or \"using the excuse of.\"  However, the core meaning subtly emphasizes the use of a flimsy or questionable excuse to achieve a hidden purpose. This is often used critically, highlighting the insincerity of the given reason.  The expression usually follows nouns or nominalized verbs (using \"の\"). It's important to note the underlying critical tone; it's rarely used to describe genuine or acceptable reasons.",
  "etymology": "The phrase is derived from the verb 託ける (kakeru), meaning \"to entrust,\" \"to consign,\" or \"to leave to.\"  In this context, the meaning shifts to \"to assign a false label to\" or \"to attach to (something else) as an excuse.\"  The use of に emphasizes the indirect or pretextual nature of the action, suggesting the underlying true motivation is different.",
