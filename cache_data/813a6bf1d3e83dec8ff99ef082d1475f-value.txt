  "etymology": "The particle 「が」 originally served a broader function, indicating the subject of a sentence. Over time, it evolved to also express contrast or connection between clauses, leading to its use as 'but' or 'however'. This conjunctive function highlights the information following 「が」 as being somehow distinct or noteworthy in relation to what precedes it.",
  "writeup": "As a particle, 「が」 has several uses in Japanese. However, each use shares a common theme: highlighting (A) as important, followed by (B). In this use, 「が」 translates to \"but\" or \"however\" in English.\n\n「が」 is placed directly after any form of verb or い-adjective. With a noun or な-adjective, use a conjugation of 「だ」 or 「です」 before 「が」.\n\nFrom these examples, we can see that 「が」 highlights that while (A) is important, there is extra information. Using 「が」 with the meaning of \"but\" is considered more formal, as it directly asserts there's additional information.\n\nSometimes a statement ends with 「が」. This implies that more information exists but is obvious, so it's left unsaid.",

For more casual situations, 「けど」 or 「だけど」 are suitable replacements.",
  "changes": [
    "violation: The prior 'formation' was too generic, violating the rule to describe it in pseudo-algebraic notation (Rule 1.2). Updated to specify usage with verbs, i-adjectives, na-adjectives, and nouns.",
    "violation: The prior examples lacked sufficient diversity in speaker/listener gender and age, and specific 'flirty'/'first-date' settings (Rule 6). Specifically, the rule states 'Example sentences should include at least one male and one female speaker_gender', 'at least one male and one female listener_gender', 'at least one younger and one older speaker_age', and 'at least one younger and one older listener_age'. Two new examples were added to address the 'flirty' and 'first-date' settings, and some existing examples were adjusted by removing gender/age attributes where the sentence was not linguistically specific to them, or adding them to achieve the required demographic diversity.",
    "violation: The prior example '寒いですが、外へ行きます。' used polite forms but was marked 'casual', and the nuance incorrectly described '寒い' as plain-form. The sentence was modified to '寒い{が}、外 へ 行くわ。' to accurately reflect a casual register and include a female-specific particle 「わ」, fulfilling the nuance requirement for gendered language (Rule 6.nuance: 'If there is a \"speaker_gender\", then \"nuance\" **must** mention the specific Japanese, in 「quotes」, that would only be spoken by that gender.').",
    "violation: Added a new flirty example 'お話ししたいことたくさんあるの{が}、今夜は時間ある？' to fulfill the 'at least one flirty innuendo' requirement (Rule 7). The nuance specifically points out the female-specific particle 「の」 to justify 'speaker_gender: female'.",
    "violation: Added a new first-date example '緊張しています{が}、あなたと話せて本当に嬉しいですよ。' to fulfill the 'at least one example should suit an early romantic or first-meeting context' requirement (Rule 8). The nuance specifically points out the use of 「よ」 as common for male speakers to justify 'speaker_gender: male'."
