    "writeup": "でなくてなんだろう is a formal pattern following nouns, expressing the speaker's certainty about something. It translates to \"if it's not (A), then what is it?\" It's used to ask a rhetorical question or assert a strong opinion. The inclusion of か at the end, as in でなくてなんだろうか, simply adds emphasis. It is mostly found in written Japanese. Because it's formal, it is rarely used in daily conversation.",
