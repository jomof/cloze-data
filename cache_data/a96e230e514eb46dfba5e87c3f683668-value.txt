    "etymology": "The kanji 却 (kaku, kae(ru)) means \"instead\", \"on the contrary\", \"but\". The auxiliary verb って (tte) adds emphasis or finality to the preceding word or phrase. Thus, 却って emphasizes the unexpected or contrary nature of the outcome.",
    "writeup": "却って (kaette) indicates an outcome that is the **opposite** of what was expected or intended. It conveys a sense of something turning out contrary to one's initial plans or efforts.  Think of it as \"rather than\" leading to the intended result, the opposite occurred.  It is an adverb, and often used in more formal settings.  The core idea is stepping back from the initial proposition to highlight the actual, often negative or undesirable, result.  The literal meaning of the kanji 却 (kaku) includes \"to retreat\", which reinforces this idea of moving away from the intended outcome.",
