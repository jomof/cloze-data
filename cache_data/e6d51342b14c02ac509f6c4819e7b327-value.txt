  "writeup": "The adverbial particle ばかり, meaning \"just,\" \"only,\" or \"nothing but,\" adds a nuance of exclusivity or emphasis to the preceding word.  It's often used after verbs (usually in the -te form) or nouns, highlighting that the action or state described is the sole or predominant focus.  After a verb in the -te form, it frequently pairs with いる to create a continuous aspect, implying that something is happening repeatedly or continuously. However,  this isn't mandatory; the same core meaning can be conveyed without いる.  Crucially, ばかり's usage changes depending on whether it describes an action or a state. For actions, it emphasizes an exclusive or repetitive behavior; for states, it emphasizes the sole existence or prevalence of a certain state of being. The nuance shifts subtly based on context.  For instance,  '泣いてばかりいる' emphasizes repetitive crying whereas 'お菓子ばかり食べている' highlights the exclusive consumption of sweets. Interestingly, despite its common usage, ばかり rarely appears in kanji. Its etymological roots trace back to 許り (sometimes 計る), which means \"to permit\" or \"to allow.\" This suggests that the only thing permitted, or the focus of that situation, is the action before ばかり.",
