  "writeup": "The Japanese grammar point 活かす (ikasu) means \"to make use of,\" \"to take full advantage of,\" or \"to capitalize on.\"  It's versatile and applies to various contexts, from skills and experiences to physical attributes and even past mistakes.  While semantically related to 生かす (ikasu, 'to keep alive'), 活かす emphasizes practical application and leveraging potential rather than literal preservation of life.  It's commonly used with adverbs indicating degree or effectiveness, such as 十分に (jūbun ni, 'sufficiently') or 有効に (yūkō ni, 'effectively'), to highlight the extent to which something is being utilized.  This verb is standard register and widely used across different demographics.",
  "etymology": "The verb 活かす (ikasu) is derived from the kanji 活 (katsu, 'to live, active') and かす (kasu, a causative suffix).  The causative suffix transforms the verb from an intransitive (something happening to itself) to a transitive (something causing something else to happen). Therefore, 活かす means to cause something to become active or to become alive; this may manifest as effectively making use of, or capitalizing on, something.",
