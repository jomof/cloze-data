    "writeup": "**次第 (shidai)** is a noun that often functions as a conjunction, expressing a temporal sequence or dependence. It can be translated as \"as soon as,\" \"depending on,\" or \"in accordance with.\" Its usage is considered relatively formal.\n\nThere are two main patterns:\n\n*   **Verb-ます stem + 次第:** Indicates that something will happen immediately after the completion of an action. Example: 終わり次第 (owari shidai) - as soon as (something) ends.\n*   **Noun + 次第:** Indicates that something depends on the noun. Example: 天気次第 (tenki shidai) - depending on the weather.\n\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   次第 often carries a sense of immediacy and certainty. The second action will occur shortly after the first.\n*   When used with nouns, it implies that the noun is the determining factor for the outcome.",
    "etymology": "The word 「次第」 originally meant \"order,\" \"sequence,\" or \"program.\" This meaning is preserved in its grammatical usage, where it indicates that something happens in sequence after a preceding action or is determined by a preceding condition.",
