  "writeup": "ございます is a polite form of the verb ある (aru) or いる (iru), meaning \"to be\" or \"to exist.\"  It's crucial to understand that while ある is used for inanimate objects and いる for animate ones, ございます transcends this distinction, functioning politely in either case.  It's derived from the archaic verb ござる (gozaru), rarely used in modern conversation except in stylized contexts like historical dramas or literature.  The addition of ます (masu) elevates ござる to the extremely polite ございます.  While ございます can refer to both animate and inanimate objects, the honorific いらっしゃる (irassharu) is generally preferred when speaking about people.  In formal settings, ございます often replaces であります (de arimasu), the polite form of である (de aru).  The particle で (de) will often precede ございます when used in formal settings.  Note that ご (go) is an honorific prefix.",
  "etymology": "ございます originates from the archaic verb ござる (gozaru), a humble and polite form of ある (aru) and いる (iru). The suffix ます (masu) transforms it into its modern polite form.  The honorific prefix ご (go) adds a layer of deference and respect, making it suitable for formal situations and interactions with superiors.",

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The phrase 「素敵な笑顔がございません」would be unnatural.  The politeness of 「ございます」suits a flirty setting and is used by a male speaker to a female listener. The use of ね (ne) softens the compliment."
