  "writeup": "と思いきや (to omoikiya) is a fascinating expression used to convey a surprising turn of events, a contrast between expectation and reality.  It's often translated as 'thought...but,' 'when I thought...but,' or 'despite having thought...'.  The phrase literally breaks down as a combination of と (to – a topic marker), 思う (omou – to think, in its conjunctive form), きや (kiya – a classical auxiliary verb indicating a past tense nuance and a turn of events), and や (ya – a classical particle marking a rhetorical question or an unexpected event). This etymological background hints at a more literal interpretation: 'I thought it was (A), but it turned out (B).'  However, in modern usage, と思いきや acts as an emphatic structure, underlining the speaker's surprise at the unexpected outcome.  It typically follows a statement of expectation, followed by the actual, contrasting reality.  The particle か (ka) can sometimes precede と思いきや, reinforcing the sense of surprise.  The second clause will always be in the past tense as it describes the realized event.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's core components, きや (kiya) and や (ya), are classical forms that retain a sense of unexpectedness and rhetorical questioning in modern Japanese. The modern meaning of と思いきや has evolved from the literal, past-tense-oriented description to a more generalized emphatic expression highlighting the unexpected contrast between expectation and outcome.",
