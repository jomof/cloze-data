  "etymology": "The particle 「な」 is believed to have originated from the older negative imperative form 「な～そ」. Over time, the 「そ」 was dropped, leaving just 「な」 as the prohibitive.",
  "writeup": "The particle 「な」 is used to strongly prohibit someone from doing something. It's attached to the dictionary form of a verb. Think of it as a forceful 'Don't!'\n\n*   It's often used in situations where the speaker feels strongly about preventing the action. Because of its directness, it's generally used by males, often towards those they perceive as being of equal or lower status, and mostly in casual speech. Use with caution, as it can sound harsh if used inappropriately.\n*   To soften the command, you can add 「よ」 at the end: 「～なよ」. This makes the prohibition sound more like a warning or friendly advice.",
