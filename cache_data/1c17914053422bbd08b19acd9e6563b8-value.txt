    "writeup": "「のは〜の方だ」 is an expression used to indicate that something, usually contrary to expectations, is the case. It translates to \"the one that (A) is (B)\". This phrase comprises several parts:\n\n*   「のは」: Nominalizes the preceding phrase, turning it into a noun phrase. The particle 「は」highlights a contrast.\n*   「の方」: Combination of 「の」 (case-marking particle) and 「方」 (noun meaning \"side\" or \"direction\").\n*   「だ(です)」: Auxiliary verb for affirmation.\n\nThe literal meaning is akin to \"that which is (A), is on the side of (B)\". By saying something is on the 'side' of (B), it softens the statement, making it less direct. To use this, attach 「のは」 to a phrase and follow it with 「noun + の方だ」. If the phrase ends in a noun, use 「なのは」 instead of 「のは」.\n\nThis expression is often used apologetically, conveying a sense of responsibility for a particular outcome.",
    "etymology": "「方 (ほう)」 literally means 'direction' or 'side.' Using 「の方だ」 adds a nuance of pointing out where the truth or responsibility lies, subtly shifting the focus rather than making a blunt statement.",
