  "writeup": "The Japanese phrase \"その結果\" (sono kekka) functions as a conjunction, indicating the consequence or outcome of a previously mentioned event or action.  The noun \"結果\" (kekka) itself means 'result'.  This expression translates to \"as a result\" or \"therefore.\" It's typically placed at the beginning of a new sentence to clearly show the causal link between two events.  \"その結果\" can be used to express both positive and negative outcomes, emphasizing the resulting situation or condition. The focus is always on the new state of affairs brought about by the preceding event.",
  "pronunciation": {
    "katakana": "ソノケッカ",
    "romaji": "sono kekka"
  },
  "etymology": "The term is a straightforward combination of \"その\" (sono, that) and \"結果\" (kekka, result).  The word \"結果\" itself is derived from the verb \"結ぶ\" (musubu, to tie, to bind), suggesting the idea of things being 'tied together' as cause and effect.",

      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses simple, straightforward language, suitable for a semi-formal setting like sharing academic progress with a teacher or a friend.  The use of 「毎日たくさん勉強した」 (mainichi takusan benkyou shita) indicates consistent effort preceding the positive outcome."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ずっとゲームばかりしていた。**その結果**、目が疲れた。",
      "english": "I kept playing video games. As a result, my eyes got tired.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This casual sentence uses simple verbs suitable for everyday conversation.  The simple past tense 「していた」 (shiteita) and 「疲れた」(tsukareta) reflect a natural, everyday experience. The phrase 「ずっとゲームばかりしていた」 (zutto ge-mu bakari shiteita) emphasizes the prolonged nature of the activity leading to the consequence."

    {
      "japanese": "彼女と真剣に話した。**その結果**、私たちは別れることになった。",
      "english": "I had a serious talk with my girlfriend. As a result, we decided to break up.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence is slightly more formal, as one might describe a serious relationship matter.  The formality is reflected in the directness of 「別れることになった」(wakareru koto ni natta), indicating a significant decision with consequences."

      "japanese": "彼は一週間徹夜で仕事を続けた。**その結果**、彼は病気になった。",

      "nuance": "This is a semi-formal sentence relating a consequence of overwork. The verbs are straightforward, and the language is suitable for a neutral setting. 「徹夜で仕事を続けた」(tetsuya de shigoto o tsuzuketa) describes the cause clearly."

      "japanese": "雨の中を傘をささずに歩いた。**その結果**、風邪を引いてしまった。",

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register is shown through the use of  「風邪を引いてしまった」(kaze o hiite shimatta), indicating an unexpected and somewhat unfortunate outcome. The directness of  「雨の中を傘をささずに歩いた」(ame no naka o kasa o sasazu ni aruita) emphasizes the cause-and-effect relationship."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "毎日野菜をたくさん食べた。その結果、肌が綺麗になった。",

      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "This intimate sentence uses 「君」(kimi), a term of endearment, and the phrase 「告白することに決めたんだ」(kōhaku suru koto ni kimeta-nda), reflecting the speaker's emotional state and decision.  The use of the particle 「んだ」(nda) adds a sense of emotional emphasis and immediacy to the confession."

  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how 'sono kekka' always introduces the consequence *after* the cause has been established. This clear cause-and-effect structure is key to using this conjunction effectively.  Mastering the nuances of formality will help convey the appropriate level of politeness and sincerity in different situations.",

    {
      "term": "そこで",
      "meaning": "Accordingly, Now, Therefore, To that end",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike \"その結果,\" which emphasizes the consequence of a previously stated cause, \"そこで\" (sokode) can indicate a transition to a new action or topic related to the previous one, without necessarily highlighting a direct cause-and-effect relationship."

      "term": "結果・の結果",
      "meaning": "As a result of",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While both express results,  \"結果\" (kekka) or \"の結果\" (no kekka) are nouns that need additional grammatical structure to create a full sentence, while \"その結果\" acts as a conjunction, smoothly connecting two clauses."
    },
    {
      "term": "そのため(に)",
      "meaning": "For that reason, Because of that, To that end",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "\"そのため(に)\" (sonotameni(ni)) is a more general phrase indicating a reason or consequence. \"その結果\" is more specific in focusing on the outcome of a previously mentioned action or event."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, carefully consider the grammatical function and the specific nuance you want to convey.  If you're explaining a cause, use \"ために.\"  If you're highlighting a direct consequence, \"その結果\" is the superior choice.  For a more formal, logical conclusion, opt for \"したがって.\" Remember that \"結果\" and \"そのため\" require additional grammatical structures to form a complete sentence."
