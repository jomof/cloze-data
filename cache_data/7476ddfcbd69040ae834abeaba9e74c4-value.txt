    "writeup": "たて, derived from the verb 立てる (tateru, \"to stand\"), functions as a suffix in Japanese, typically attached to the past conjunctive (た) form of verbs. It conveys the sense that something has \"just been finished\" or is \"freshly finished.\" As a suffix, たて transforms verbs into nouns, which allows them to be followed by a の phrase or a case-marking particle and a noun.\n\n**Important Note:** たて emphasizes the moment immediately after something is completed, highlighting its freshness rather than simply stating that it is finished. Consequently, it's often used with verbs related to time-sensitive qualities that degrade after completion.",
    "etymology": "The suffix 「たて」 comes from the 連用形 (ren'yōkei, continuative or stem form) of the verb 「立つ (たつ)」, which means \"to stand.\" In this context, 「たて」 implies something newly established or fresh, as if it has just \"stood up\" or come into existence. This etymology adds a nuance of immediacy and newness to the meaning of the grammar point.",
