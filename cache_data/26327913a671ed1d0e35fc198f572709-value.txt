    "etymology": "The verb 「過ぎる(すぎる)」 means 'to pass, to exceed'. When attached to the stem of another verb or an adjective, it retains the sense of 'exceeding' a normal or acceptable limit.",
    "writeup": "「すぎる」 is a verb meaning \"to exceed\" or \"to go past.\" It retains this meaning when attached to other words, creating the equivalent of saying something is \"too much.\"\n\n「すぎる」 is added to:\n*   The ます-stem of verbs.\n*   The stem form of い-adjectives (simply remove the い).\n*   The stem form of な-adjectives (simply remove the な).\n\nIn casual speech, the 「る」 is often omitted, with 「すぎ」 used by itself. For example, you might hear 「食べすぎ」 instead of 「食べすぎる」. This is a very common casual pattern.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n*   When using 「すぎる」 with 「ない」, the 「い」 changes to 「さ」, creating 「なさすぎる」, meaning \"too much not (A),\" or more naturally, \"not enough (A).\"\n*   With regular 「ない」 forms, 「では」 or 「じゃ」 is required after な-adjectives.\n*   When used with 「いい」 to mean \"too good\", remember that the stem form of 「いい」 is 「よ」, not 「い」. Therefore, 「よすぎる」 is correct, while 「いすぎる」 is not.",
