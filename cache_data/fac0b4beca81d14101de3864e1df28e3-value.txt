    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とはいえ」 is derived from 「とは言う」 (to wa iu), meaning \"to say that,\" combined with 「いえ」, the imperative form of 「言う」 (iu), used here to concede a point. Thus, literally, it suggests \"even if one says that...\".",
    "writeup": "「とはいえ」 is a formal expression used to concede a point while introducing a contrasting statement. It's similar to saying \"although (A), (B) remains true\" or \"be that as it may, (B).\" It acknowledges the validity of the first statement (A) but emphasizes that it doesn't negate the importance or truth of the second statement (B). Think of it as saying, \"Say that it is (A), that still doesn't change (B).\"",
