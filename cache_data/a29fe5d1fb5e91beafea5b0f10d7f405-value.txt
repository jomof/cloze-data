  "writeup": "The particle 際に (sai ni) is a postpositional particle that indicates \"when,\" \"at the time of,\" or \"on the occasion of.\" It's often used in more formal settings and carries a sense of importance or significance to the event being described.  Unlike 時に (toki ni), which can be used for everyday occurrences, 際に emphasizes a more noteworthy event—something potentially consequential or requiring special attention.  It follows nouns (preceded by の), and verbs in their dictionary or past tense forms.  While it can be used with recurring events, it highlights a specific instance or a particular aspect of that event, often involving a change in response or circumstance.  Think of it as highlighting a crucial moment or a turning point within a larger context.  Using it with routine situations would sound unnatural.",
  "etymology": "The word 際 (sai) comes from the noun meaning \"verge,\" \"brink,\" or \"edge.\"  It suggests being at a critical point or juncture, emphasizing the importance of the time or circumstance being described.  The particle に (ni) marks the time or occasion.",

      "setting": "reflective",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses more descriptive and emotional language, fitting for personal reflection. The use of 「心を奪われました」 (kokoro o ubawaremashita) indicates the strong feeling of the speaker and is naturally used in such reflective settings.  This is a sentence that would typically be spoken by a female speaker, due to the sensitivity of the feeling expressed, and how this sensitivity is conveyed through the sentence."

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "Choosing the correct particle depends heavily on context and the level of formality.  If the event is routine, use とき.  For more significant occasions, 際に or に際して are better choices, depending on the formality.  にあたり/にあたって describes the process of approaching or preparing for an event, while ついでに signifies an additional action during another task. 折には focuses on finding a convenient time or opportune moment."
