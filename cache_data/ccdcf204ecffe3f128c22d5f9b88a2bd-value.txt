    "etymology": "Many な-adjectives have roots in Sino-Japanese vocabulary (kango 漢語) or are derived from foreign loanwords (gairaigo 外来語), often from English. This historical influence contributes to their unique grammatical behavior compared to native Japanese adjectives.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, な-Adjectives, also known as adjectival nouns or *keiyō dōshi* (形容動詞), function as both adjectives and nouns. They differ from regular nouns primarily in their conjugation rules. The dictionary form of a な-Adjective is typically followed by 「だ」 (plain form) or 「です」 (polite form) at the end of a sentence.\n\nThe particle 「な」 is **only** attached when the な-Adjective directly modifies a noun. Without 「な」, you cannot use them to describe a noun. For instance, 「きれいな絵」 (a pretty picture) is correct, but 「きれい絵」 is incorrect.\n\nMany な-Adjectives originate from foreign (Chinese/English) words, which is why they require unique conjugation rules.\n\n**Important Note:** Distinguishing between a な-Adjective and a regular noun can be challenging. One trick is to use the adverb 「とても」 (very). If 「とても」 sounds natural before the word, it's likely a な-Adjective, because adjectives are measurable (e.g., \"very big,\" \"very small\"), while nouns are not (e.g., *unnatural*: \"very dog,\" \"very boat\"). For example, 「とても綺麗」 (very pretty) sounds natural, while 「とても外」 (very outside) does not. This makes 「綺麗」 a な-Adjective and 「外」 a regular noun.",
