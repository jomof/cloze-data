    "etymology": "The grammar point 「でしかない」 is formed from 「で」 (the conjunctive form of the copula 「だ」), 「しか」 (meaning \"only\" or \"nothing but\"), and 「ない」 (the negative form of 「ある」, indicating absence or lack). The combination creates the nuance of something being 'nothing more than' or 'merely' the stated noun.",
    "writeup": "「でしかない」 indicates that something is \"merely,\" \"nothing but,\" or \"no more than\" what is stated. It emphasizes the limited value or significance of something. This pattern is used directly after nouns. While it can carry either a positive or negative connotation, it often implies a slightly negative nuance, suggesting that something lacks value beyond its basic definition. It's similar to 「にすぎない」 or 「しか〜ない」, but the key difference is the direct attachment to nouns using 「で」.",
