    "etymology": "The term 'う-verb' comes from the fact that these verbs end in a 'う' sound in their dictionary form. They are also known as Godan verbs (五段動詞), meaning 'five-level verbs,' because their conjugations involve changes across all five vowel sounds (あ, い, う, え, お) within the same consonant column.",
    "writeup": "う-Verbs are verbs in Japanese that end in う, く, す, つ, ぬ, ぶ, む, る, or ぐ. These verbs are called Godan (五段) verbs, meaning \"five-level\" verbs. This is because their conjugations use all five vowel sounds (あ, い, う, え, お) within the same consonant column.\n\nFor example, in the verb 聞く (kiku, to listen), the く changes depending on the conjugation:\n*   聞かない (kikanai, do not listen)\n*   聞きたい (kikitai, want to listen)\n*   聞く (kiku, listen)\n*   聞ける (kikeru, can listen)\n*   聞こう (kikou, let's listen)\n\nAs you can see, the \"ku\" sound in 聞く changes to other sounds in the K-column. This same thing happens with all of the other う-verbs.\n\n**Important**: The dictionary form of the verb may also be referred to as \"plain form\", \"casual form\", or \"short form,\" depending on the textbook or source.",
