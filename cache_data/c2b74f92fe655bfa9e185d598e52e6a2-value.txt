    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ように」 indicates similarity or manner. It's used to express that something is like something else, or that something is done in a certain way. 「ように」 functions as an adverbial phrase, modifying a verb or adjective. It comes in very handy for expressing comparisons.\n\n*   **Plain Form Connection:** When connecting to verbs or i-adjectives, use the plain form directly before 「ように」.  For example, 「話すように」 (like speaking).  When connecting to na-adjectives, use 「な」 before 「ように」.  For example, 「静かなように」 (like it's quiet).\n*   **Noun Connection:** When connecting to nouns, use 「の」 before 「ように」. For example, 「先生のように」 (like a teacher).\n*   **Common Usage:** 「ように」 is versatile and appears in many everyday situations to describe resemblances or how something is done.",
    "etymology": "「ように」 is derived from the noun 「様 (よう)」, which means \"way,\" \"manner,\" or \"appearance.\" The addition of 「に」 turns it into an adverbial particle, indicating \"in the manner of\" or \"like.\"",
