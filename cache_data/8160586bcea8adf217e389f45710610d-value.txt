    "writeup": "The particle 「と」 can function as a conditional conjunction, similar to \"if\" in English. However, it carries a nuance of inevitability or a natural consequence.  It emphasizes a direct and predictable relationship between the first action or state and the subsequent result. Think of it as expressing something that *always* happens when the condition is met.\n\nThere are a few key uses of 「と」 as a conditional:\n\n*   **仮定の順接 (katei no junsetsu - assumed direct consequence):** This is when the result is considered a natural and expected outcome.  The speaker assumes the result will definitely occur.\n*   **確定の順接 (kakutei no junsetsu - confirmed direct consequence):**  Here, the result is a known fact or something that invariably happens.\n*   **仮定の逆接 (katei no gyakusetsu - assumed opposing consequence):** This is less common but can occur when the outcome is contrary to what might be expected, but is still a consistent result.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「と」 implies a strong connection between the condition and the result.  It's not used for hypothetical or uncertain situations where the outcome is just a possibility.\n*   The verb preceding 「と」 is always in the dictionary form (present simple, non-past).\n*   The result clause often uses present tense, indicating a habitual action or a future certainty.\n*   Unlike 「ば」, 「なら」, or 「たら」, 「と」 is generally not used for expressing wishes, hopes, requests, or intentions in the result clause.",
    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 originally indicated a shared action or state, meaning \"together with\" or \"and\". This sense of conjunction extends to its conditional usage, where it links a condition and its inevitable result, implying they \"go together\".",
