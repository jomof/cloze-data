  "writeup": "The Japanese grammatical construction ていた (or ていました, its polite form) indicates a continuous action in the past.  It's formed by combining the て-form of a verb with the past tense of the verb いる (iru, to be/exist).  Think of it as the Japanese equivalent of English's \"was doing.\"  While often indicating a completed action, ていた can also suggest an ongoing action the speaker is uncertain about or wishes to politely convey.  This nuance is similar to the way English uses \"was doing,\" implying the action might still be in progress but with some uncertainty or politeness.",
  "etymology": "ていた is a compound of the て-form (a form used to connect verbs) and the past tense of the verb いる (いる, to be, to exist).  The て-form itself has ancient roots in the way verbs were connected in classical Japanese.  The past tense form いた is a regular conjugation of いる.",

      "term": "Verb + ている",
      "nuance": "Unlike ていた, which describes a continuous action in the past, ている describes a continuous action in the present.  Pay close attention to the tense."

    {
      "term": "Verb + た",
      "nuance": "While た indicates a simple past action, ていた conveys a continuous action spanning a period in the past.  The duration of the action is key to choosing between them."

  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "Distinguishing between ていた and other similar past tense forms hinges on understanding the duration and continuity of the action.  ていた specifically highlights an ongoing action that occurred over a period in the past, unlike the simple past (た) or present continuous (ている)."
