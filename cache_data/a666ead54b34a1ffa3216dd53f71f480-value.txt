    "etymology": "The term 「ごとし」 originates from the verb 「如し (gotoshi)」, an archaic form meaning \"to be like\" or \"to resemble.\" It carries a nuance of formal or literary expression, often found in older texts and formal speeches.",
    "writeup": "「ごとし」 is an auxiliary adjective used to express resemblance or similarity. It's similar to 「ようだ」 or 「みたいだ」, but it carries a more formal and literary tone. You'll often find it in written Japanese or formal speeches. It indicates that something is like something else, or behaves as if it were something else. The nuance is that it's not necessarily a direct or literal comparison, but rather an impression or subjective assessment. Note the {が/かの} variations which add emphasis to the comparison.",
