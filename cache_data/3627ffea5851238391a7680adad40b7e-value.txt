    "etymology": "The grammar point 「わけではない」 is derived from 「訳 (wake)」 meaning \"reason, explanation, circumstances,\" 「で (de)」 which is the te form of だ, 「は (wa)」 a topic marker, and 「ない (nai)」 meaning \"not.\" Therefore, literally, it means \"it is not the reason/case that...\"",
    "writeup": "「わけではない」 is used to express that something is not necessarily the case, or to partially deny an implication. It's similar to saying \"It's not that...\" or \"It doesn't mean that...\" in English. The key is that it doesn't completely negate something but rather expresses a nuance of \"not necessarily\" or \"not entirely.\" The 「では」 part can often be replaced with 「じゃ」 for a more casual feel.\n\n*   It is used to soften a statement.\n*   It implies there are other factors involved.\n*   「わけではない」 is commonly used to clarify or correct misunderstandings.",
