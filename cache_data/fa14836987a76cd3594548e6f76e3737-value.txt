    "etymology": "The grammar point 「といわれている」 is composed of:  「と」 (the quotative particle indicating the content of speech or thought), 「言われる」 (the passive form of the verb 「言う」 - to say), and 「いる」 (the auxiliary verb indicating a continuing state or progressive action). Thus, it literally translates to \"it is being said that\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「といわれている」 translates to \"it is said that...\" or \"is known as...\". It expresses a commonly held belief, rumor, or piece of general knowledge.  It functions similarly to 「とされている」, but where 「とされている」 emphasizes the established fact or result, 「といわれている」 highlights the act of something *being said*. Think of it as quoting a generally accepted opinion or a piece of information that is circulating.  The verb used here is 「言う」 (iu - to say) in its passive form, indicating the action is being done to the subject (the information).",
