    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ているあいだに」 combines 「ている」, the continuous form of a verb, with 「あいだに」, meaning 'during' or 'while'. It indicates that something happens within the duration of an ongoing action. 「あいだ」originally meant 'space' or 'interval', but evolved to denote a period of time.",
    "writeup": "「ているあいだに」 expresses that event (B) happens within the timeframe of event (A), which is ongoing. It translates naturally as \"during the time that (A), (B)\". The (B) action must occur at some point within the duration of (A). The events don't need to be specifically related. 「間に」 literally means an \"interval\", highlighting (A) as the 'whole' span of time, within which (B) happens/will happen at some point.",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "commanding",
            "conjugation": null,
            "nuance": "The 「ねえ」 at the beginning indicates a casual tone. 「話しかけないで」 is a negative imperative, a direct command not to speak. Since this is a casual expression, one would not say this to their superior."

            "setting": "storytelling",
            "conjugation": null,
            "nuance": "This sentence describes a past event in a casual manner. The use of 「た」 at the end of 「怪我をした」 marks the sentence as past tense. Because this is a recounting of the past, there is no speaker_gender or listener_gender.",
            "etymology": "「怪我」 (kega) means injury. It uses N4 kanji 「怪」 and N3 kanji 「我」."

            "conjugation": null,
            "nuance": "This sentence describes an interruption during an activity. 「かかってきました」 implies that the phone call was received by the speaker.",
            "etymology": "「電話がかかってきました」 (denwa ga kakatte kimashita) literally means 'a phone call came'. The verb 「掛かる」 (kakaru) is used for phones, and is not directly translatable in this way."

            "nuance": "The speaker is male and it is a flirty context, therefore I should use 「〜んだ」. Therefore this sentence could naturally continue as 「授業を**しているあいだに**、君のことを考えていたんだ」. The speaker is showing the female listener their honest feeling by saying 「君のことを考えていた」."
