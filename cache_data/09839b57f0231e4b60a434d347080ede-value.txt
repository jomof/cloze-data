    "etymology": "The expression is composed of 「いつ」(when), 「の」(possessive particle), 「間」(interval), 「に」(particle indicating location or time), and 「か」(question particle). The 「か」 adds a nuance of uncertainty or surprise about the time frame.",
    "writeup": "「いつの間にか」 is a set expression used as a standalone adverb. It means \"suddenly,\" \"unnoticed,\" or \"without realizing.\" The inclusion of 「か」 often carries a nuance of surprise, highlighting an unknown interval within which something occurred. When you want to convey a similar feeling without the element of surprise, 「あっという間に」 (in the blink of an eye) may be used instead.",
