    "etymology": "「って」 is a colloquial contraction of the particle 「と」. Over time, it became acceptable in casual speech.",
    "writeup": "「って」 is a casual variation of the 「と」 particle used for quoting something. In Japanese, this use is called 「引用」, which means \"reference\" or \"citation.\" 「って」 is almost exclusively used after direct quotations and followed by a verb indicating the type of communication, such as 「言った」、「思った」, or 「聞いた」. Similar to 「と」, the verb following 「って」 is often omitted, even more so in casual speech.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\nWhile frequently heard, using 「って」 in sentences with polite structures like 「です」 or 「ます」 can sound unnatural. However, in formal but friendly conversations, such as between a 「先輩」 (senior) and 「後輩」 (junior), it is generally acceptable.",
