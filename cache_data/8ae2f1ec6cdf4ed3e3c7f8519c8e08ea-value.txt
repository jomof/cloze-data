  "writeup": "The phrase と聞いた (tokiita) translates to \"I heard that...\" in English.  It's a common and versatile expression used to relay information you've received from others. The particle と (to) marks the quoted information, while 聞いた (kiita) is the past tense of 聞く (kiku), meaning \"to hear.\"  This construction is typically used in casual to semi-formal settings.  Note that the だ (da) copula is often omitted in casual speech, particularly after nouns and な-adjectives, although technically it should be included for grammatical correctness.  This omission is prevalent in everyday conversation and shouldn't be viewed as incorrect in most settings. The nuance of the phrase subtly indicates that the speaker is not necessarily vouching for the truth of the information; it's simply something they heard.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's etymology is straightforward:  と comes from the quotative particle と, indicating cited information. 聞いた is the past tense of 聞く (kiku, to hear), derived from the ancient verb form きく (kiku). The combination creates a natural expression for reporting hearsay.",
