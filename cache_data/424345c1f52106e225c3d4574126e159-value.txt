    "writeup": "Coming from the same kanji as 難しい \"difficult\", 難い is a suffix that also means \"difficult\". However, in the case of がたい, it will be attached to the **masu-stem** of verbs, and conveys that \"(A) is difficult to do\".  がたい is almost always written without kanji in this meaning.\n\nCompared to にくい, which can simply imply that something is \"uncomfortable\" to do, がたい refers almost exclusively to 困難であること \"things that involve a high degree of difficulty, distress, or infeasibility\". Due to this, がたい will come across as far stronger than にくい, and may imply that a certain task is almost impossible.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   がたい attaches to the masu-stem of verbs.\n*   It expresses a high degree of difficulty, often suggesting something is nearly impossible.\n*   It's stronger and more formal than にくい.",
