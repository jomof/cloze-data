    "writeup": "In order to convey \"regardless of (A)\", \"no matter if (A)\", or \"with or without (A)\", the expression にかかわらず will often be used. This is a combination of に, the う-Verb 関わる 'to be affected', 'to be influenced', and the literary auxiliary verb ず, which connects with verbs in the same way, and carries the same meaning as ない. This structure may be seen with verbs or adjectives in either their dictionary or negative forms, or with nouns in their dictionary form. Frequently the same word is repeated in both the positive and the negative, or grouped with かどうか in order to strengthen the \"whether (A) or not (A)\" nuance. As the literal meaning of this structure is \"without being influenced by (A), (B)\", or \"without being affected by (A), (B)\", the primary nuance is on the fact that (B) is something that exists or will happen without consideration for (A). Due to this, にかかわらず may also be used to show that \"any type of (A) will result in the same (B)\".",
