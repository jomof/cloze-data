  "writeup": "The grammar point 必要 (hitsuyō), meaning \"necessary,\" is a crucial part of expressing needs in Japanese.  It's used with nouns, requiring you to nominalize verbs if you want to express the necessity of an action.  The structure is typically  [Noun] が 必要だ/です.  While が and だ/です can sometimes be omitted in casual conversation, using が helps clarify what's necessary.  Mastering this will greatly enhance your ability to express needs and requirements in various situations.",
  "etymology": "必要 (hitsuyō) itself is a compound word.  必 (hitsu) means \"certainly,\" \"necessarily,\" or \"inevitably,\" while 要 (yō) means \"need,\" \"requirement,\" or \"essential element.\"  The combination perfectly captures the sense of something being indispensable.",
