    "writeup": "The causative-passive form expresses that someone is **made to do something** against their will or without their consent. It combines the causative auxiliary verb せる (or させる) \"to make/let do\" with the passive auxiliary verb られる \"to be the receiver of an action.\"\n\nTo form the causative-passive:\n\n*   For **ru-verbs**, conjugate the verb to its causative form (remove る and add させる), then remove the final る and add られる. Example: 食べる (taberu) → 食べさせる (tabesaseru) → 食べさせられる (tabesaserareru).\n*   For **u-verbs**, conjugate the verb to its causative form (change the final う-sound to an あ-sound and add せる), then remove the final る and add られる. Example: 飲む (nomu) → 飲ませる (nomuseru) → 飲ませられる (nomserareru).\n*   **Special cases:**\n    *   する (suru) becomes させられる (saserareru).\n    *   来る (kuru) becomes 来させられる (kosaserareru).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The person *causing* the action is marked with the particle **に**.\n*   The person *being made* to do the action is the subject of the sentence, usually marked with **は** or **が**.\n*   The causative-passive often carries a negative connotation, implying the action is undesirable or forced.",
