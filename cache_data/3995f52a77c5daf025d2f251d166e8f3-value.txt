  "writeup": "をこめて (wo komete), or を込めて (wo komete) in its kanji form, is a phrase expressing the nuance of something being 'full of (A)' or 'filled with (A)'.  It's structurally composed of を (o) and the te-form of the verb 込める (kome-ru), meaning 'to pack into' or 'to load with'.  Thus, the literal and figurative meanings align closely.  をこめて follows the noun signifying the feeling or emotion involved.  **Crucially**, this is treated as a set phrase and is typically used only when a feeling or emotion is being 'packed into' something else.  It adds a layer of depth and sincerity to the expression, conveying the speaker's heartfelt intention or emotion.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's core, 込める (kome-ru), originates from the verb 込む (komu), meaning 'to be packed' or 'to be crowded'. The addition of the '-meru' suffix transforms the intransitive verb into a causative form, implying the action of 'packing something into' something else.  This causative aspect is key to understanding how 'feeling' is actively 'put into' the object.",
