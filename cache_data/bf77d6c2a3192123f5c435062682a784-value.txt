    "writeup": "The grammar point **ところだった ②** expresses that you were just about to do something, or were in the middle of doing it, when something else happened to interrupt or change the outcome. It conveys a sense of 'almost' or 'nearly' in the context of an action that was on the verge of occurring or in progress.  It emphasizes that you were in the *process* or *state* of doing something before a different situation arose.  You can think of it as being \"at the point of doing something.\" Often, this grammar point implies a near miss, whether it's a near miss of something bad happening or a near miss of something good happening. When a positive outcome was narrowly missed, it's common to see **のに** used afterward, similar to saying \"even though I was just about to...\"",
