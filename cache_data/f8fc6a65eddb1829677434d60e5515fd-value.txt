    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ていては」 is derived from 「ている」 (the continuous form of a verb) + 「は」 (a topic marker indicating a hypothetical or repetitive situation). Thus, it combines the idea of continuous action with a conditional \"if\" or \"when\".",
    "writeup": "「ていては」 is used to express that if one continues with a certain action (A), a negative outcome (B) will result. It combines the 「て」-form of a verb, 「いる」 (to be) in its 「て」-form (「いて」), and 「は」. The 「ては」 part is similar to that in other patterns like 「てはいけない」, 「てはならない」, and 「てはだめ」, which express prohibition or negativity. Essentially, 「ていては」 highlights the continuous nature of an action and warns about its potential consequences. It's a blend of continuous action and hypothetical/repetitive situations, depending on the verb it attaches to. It is used to express a negative result.",
