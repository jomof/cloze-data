  "writeup": "もらう (morau) is a fundamental N5 verb meaning \"to receive,\" \"to get,\" or \"to obtain.\"  It's often taught alongside くれる (kureru) and あげる (ageru), but crucially, it focuses on the *recipient's* perspective.  Unlike くれる and あげる, which emphasize the giver, もらう uses the particle に (or から) to indicate the *giver*, while the receiver is often marked with が or は, or even omitted altogether if the context is clear. The object received takes the を particle.  Mastering もらう involves understanding this subtle shift in focus.  While all three verbs (くれる、あげる、もらう) deal with giving and receiving, the nuance is distinct and vital for natural communication.",
