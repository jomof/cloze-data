    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ていた」 is formed by combining the 「て」-form of a verb with the past tense of the verb 「いる」(to exist), which is 「いた」. The 「て」-form indicates a connection or sequence, and 「いる」indicates a state of being or continuous action. Thus, 「ていた」 literally means something like \"being in the state of having done something,\" which is then used to express an action in progress in the past.",
    "writeup": "To convey that '(A) was happening', or that somebody 'was doing (A)' in Japanese, 「ていた」 (or 「ていました」) will be used. 「ていた」 is a construction that uses the conjunction particle 「て」 and the *ichidan* verb 「いる」(to exist), in its past tense form 「いた」.\n\nSometimes 「ていた」 is used to express things that are still ongoing, but the speaker is unsure about, or would like to politely advise the listener about. This is very similar to the way in which English uses '(A) was doing (B)'.\n\nFor example, although the action of 'sitting' is not finished, we can imagine that the speaker is suggesting that 'dad was sitting here, and he still is, but he just went to get a drink'. The same kind of sentence could be used when the speaker has walked away from where their dad was sitting, and doesn't actually know if he is still sitting there or not.",
