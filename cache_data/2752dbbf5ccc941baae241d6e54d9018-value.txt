  "writeup": "The grammar point 'てある' describes a state resulting from a completed action, focusing on the resultant state of the *object* rather than the *actor*.  It's crucial to understand that **てある only works with transitive verbs**, verbs that take a direct object.  The nuance is that the state is passively present—the object *is* in the state of having been acted upon.  Think of it as 'to be left (in a certain state)' or 'to remain (in a certain state)'.  The particle が is often used with the object when the action involves preparation (e.g., reservations, preparations), while を is preferred for actions requiring no preparation (e.g., opening a door). This is a subtle yet significant distinction. Mastering this will significantly improve your ability to express passive states in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "てある combines the て-form of a verb (indicating the completion of an action) with ある (to exist).  The use of ある emphasizes the existence of the resulting state, not the action itself. This makes it distinct from ている, which emphasizes the ongoing nature of the action.",
