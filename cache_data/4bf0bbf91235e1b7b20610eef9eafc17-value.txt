    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ていただけませんか」 is composed of 「て」 (the conjunctive particle), 「いただく」 (the humble form of 「もらう」, meaning \"to receive\"), 「ません」 (the polite negative auxiliary verb), and 「か」 (the question particle). The verb 「いただく」 literally means \"to receive\" or \"to accept,\" but in this context, it expresses the speaker's humility when requesting someone to do something.",
    "writeup": "「ていただけませんか」 is a polite way to ask someone to do something for you. It's the humble form of 「てもらえませんか」, which is itself the negative potential form of 「てもらう」 (\"to have (A) done by someone else\"). This grammar point combines 「て」 (the conjunctive particle), the verb 「いただく」 (\"to receive\"), the polite-negative auxiliary verb 「ません」, and the question particle 「か」. It translates similarly to 「てもらえませんか」, meaning \"won't you (A)\" or \"could you please (A)?\" 「いただく」 can also be written as 「頂く」, which literally means \"to be topped with.\" This kanji acknowledges that the person performing the action is doing so from a position of \"above,\" indicating respect.",
