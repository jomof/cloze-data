  "writeup": "に限ったことではない is a nuanced expression emphasizing that something isn't confined to a specific group or situation.  It uses the verb 限る (kagiru, 'to limit'), appearing here in its past tense form, 限った (kagitta).  The structure combines the particle に (ni), marking the target of the limitation, the noun こと (koto, 'thing'), the auxiliary verb だ (da, 'to be') in its connective form で (de), the topic marker は (wa), and finally the negative adjective ない (nai).  The literal meaning, 'it's not a thing limited to...', conveys the broader implication that the subject extends beyond the initially mentioned scope.  This construction follows nouns and adds formality to the statement.  It subtly suggests the subject isn't unusual or exceptional, thus downplaying the significance of the initial restriction.  Mastering this pattern enhances your ability to express yourself with greater precision and sophistication in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The core of this grammar point lies in the verb 限る (kagiru), meaning \"to limit.\"  Its past tense form, 限った (kagitta), is crucial to the construction. The use of こと (koto), meaning \"thing,\" adds a level of abstraction, making the statement more general and less about specific instances. The combination with で (de) and は (wa) creates a nuanced statement about something not being limited.  Understanding the etymology of 限る helps appreciate the subtle emphasis on limitation and its negation.",

      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses a common phrase 「最近の若者」 (recent young people) and 「挨拶ができない」 (can't greet properly), setting a relatable context. The use of  「と言われている」 (it is said) softens the statement.  The overall register is semi-formal, suitable for everyday conversation discussing societal trends."

      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence is casual, 「なんか」 (somehow) and 「仕事する気にならない」 (don't feel like working) being colloquial. It's a personal reflection, hence the reflective setting."
