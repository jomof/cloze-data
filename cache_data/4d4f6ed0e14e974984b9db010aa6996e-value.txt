    "writeup": "ことがある is an expression in Japanese that combines the noun こと with the case marking particle が, and the verb ある. It is often translated as \"to be possible\", \"to occasionally occur\", or \"to sometimes occur\". However, the more literal translation of ことがある is \"(A) is a thing that exists\". ことがある may be paired with the attributive form of any word. Occasionally, が may be replaced by も. In these situations, it implies that \"(A) is also a thing that exists\". Basically, this highlights that (A) is something that needs to be considered (among other things).\n\n**Important Consideration:** ことがある differs from たことがある (a phrase commonly paired with the past form of verbs). たことがある highlights a single event in which the (A) verb was completed. However, when the verb is not in past form, it simply implies that there are \"times\" when the verb happens, as opposed to a single/specific time.",
