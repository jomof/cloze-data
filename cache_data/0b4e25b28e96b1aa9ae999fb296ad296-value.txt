        "V[masu-stem] + つつ": "Expresses doing something while also doing something else. Indicates two concurrent actions or states.",

    "etymology": "The grammar point 「つつ」 comes from the verb 「つむ」 (tsumu), meaning \"to spin\" or \"to continue.\" The nuance implies a continuous action or state happening simultaneously with another. It carries a sense of persistence or duration. The 「つ」 sound itself is repetitive, which is a common technique in Japanese for conveying ongoing action.",
    "writeup": "「つつ」 is a formal Japanese grammar structure used to indicate that two actions are happening simultaneously. It's similar to 「ながら」, but 「つつ」 often implies a more continuous or ongoing state for the first action, whereas 「ながら」 can be used for both physical movements and states. It is generally used in writing or more formal speech. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「つつ」 connects two clauses where the actions happen at the same time.\n*   While 「ながら」 can be used for physical actions, 「つつ」 is often preferred for ongoing states or thoughts.\n*   「つつ」 is considered more formal than 「ながら」.",
