    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ものではない」 is derived from 「もの」, referring to a thing or matter, 「で」 (the te-form of だ), and 「はない」, meaning 'does not exist' or 'is not'. Combined, it implies that something 'is not the kind of thing' one should do, or 'is not something' that can be done, thus carrying the nuance of prohibition or impossibility.",
    "writeup": "「ものではない」 is a versatile grammar point used to express various forms of prohibition, impossibility, or natural consequence. It essentially conveys that something *shouldn't* be done, *couldn't possibly* be done, or *naturally cannot* be done. The nuance often implies a sense of warning or gentle admonishment, though it can be used in stronger contexts as well. It is similar to 「べきではない」 or 「てはいけない」, but 「ものではない」 often carries a slightly more subjective or explanatory tone. The politeness level can be adjusted by conjugating 「ない」 to 「ありません」, creating 「ものではありません」.",
