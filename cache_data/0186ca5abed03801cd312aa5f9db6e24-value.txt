  "writeup": "何から何まで (nanikara nanimade) is a set phrase meaning \"everything from beginning to end,\" \"everything and anything,\" or \"from head to toe.\"  It's a concise way to express completeness or totality.  The structure—何 (nani, what) + から (kara, from) + 何 (nani, what) + まで (made, until)—literally translates to 'from whatever to whatever,' emphasizing the comprehensive nature of what's being described.  It functions similarly to an adverb, usually appearing at the sentence's beginning to set the stage for the following description.  Its usage often mirrors the English 'absolutely everything' in expressions of gratitude or apology.",
  "etymology": "This phrase's etymology is straightforward.  It's a combination of common particles and the word \"what.\" The lack of specific nouns emphasizes the all-encompassing nature of the described action or situation. The inherent ambiguity of 'what' in this phrase underscores its versatility and capacity to express a wide range of meanings.",
