  "writeup": "たら〜で is a fascinating expression used with repeating words, conveying a nuanced meaning beyond a simple conditional.  It's often used to express that 'if (A), then with (A), (B) will also occur', irrespective of whether (A) is positive or negative. A common translation is 'even if (A), (B)'. The particle used depends on the word type preceding it: たら or ば with verbs or い-adjectives; なら with な-adjectives.  The nuance shifts subtly depending on the first clause (A). The two most common interpretations are: 1) If (A) is good, the problem (B) arises; 2) If (A) is problematic, (B) is still possible.  In essence, (B) often presents a contradictory or unexpected consequence to (A).  It's a powerful tool for showing complex situations where even favorable conditions have drawbacks or less favorable conditions still allow for action.",
