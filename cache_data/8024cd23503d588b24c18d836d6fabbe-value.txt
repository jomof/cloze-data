  "writeup": "This grammar point, てからでないと, translates to \"(Not) unless ~ cannot\" or \"(Not) until ~ cannot.\" It's built using the て-form of verbs, followed by から (\"from\"), で (\"with,\" in this context indicating a condition), ない (\"not\"), and と (\"if\").  It emphasizes that action B cannot happen unless or until action A is completed.  The inherent negativity in the structure (ない) is crucial; the second clause (B) is always negative.  The structure implies a sequential relationship: A must precede B.  This sequence could relate to the completion of A before B can begin, or simply to the possibility of B becoming available after A is done.  While typically used with verbs, it can be applied to other parts of speech that allow a て-form. Alternatively, the hypothetical ば form may be used instead of と, resulting in てからでなければ. This is a more formal and less common variation.  This grammar point is versatile and used in various registers, but avoids overly casual or intimate settings.",
  "etymology": "The structure is a combination of several fundamental grammatical elements.  て-form is a versatile conjugation expressing various aspects and connections; から indicates the starting point of something; で marks a condition or medium; ない negates; and と introduces a conditional clause, implying the necessity of the preceding clause.",

      "conjugation": null,

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses casual language but implies a serious situation.  The use of 「彼」and 「結婚」 shows a personal and somewhat intimate tone, suitable for a conversation among close friends. The speaker's gender is inferred from the use of 「彼」to refer to her partner."

      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The polite register is shown by the use of 「お付き合い」. The sentence implies a romantic interest, making it suitable for a flirtatious context. The use of 「あなた」is fairly polite but doesn’t make the situation overly formal.  The implied meaning is a subtle flirtatious refusal with the promise of future interest."

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The polite register enhances the nuanced feeling of uncertainty and caution in the early stages of a relationship. The phrase 「真剣にお付き合い」expresses a commitment to something serious, which requires deeper knowledge of the other person. The female speaker's cautious tone is conveyed by choosing her words carefully."

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the negative form (ない) is inherent to the てからでないと structure.  Attempting to use it with an affirmative sentence will lead to an unnatural construction.

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The subtle differences between てからでないと and its near synonyms lie in the nuance of temporal sequence and the emphasis on necessity. Choose carefully based on whether the emphasis is on the sequence of actions or simply the conditional requirement.  Incorrect usage might cause misunderstandings, so practicing with each one in context is essential for mastery."
