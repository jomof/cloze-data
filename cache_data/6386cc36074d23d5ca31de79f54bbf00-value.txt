  "writeup": "The auxiliary verb よう (ように) is frequently paired with verbs to express the speaker's wish or goal for the action's completion.  This is achieved implicitly through the meaning of the kanji 様 (yō), 'manner of doing'.  ように祈る (yō ni inoru, or 祈る in kanji) implies the speaker is praying for something to happen. This stems from the meaning of the u-verb 祈る (inoru), which translates to 'to pray' or 'to beg'. While applicable to actual prayer, it's more commonly used to express a hope.  Similar to other よう に structures, ないように (nai yō ni) can be used with 祈る to express hoping something *doesn't* happen.\n\n**Important Considerations:** Unlike other よう に structures,  ように祈る is sometimes shortened to ように alone, especially after ます.  This shortened form *always* means 'to hope for' and shouldn't be confused with similar grammar points like ようにする, ようになる, or よう に 言う.\n\n**Fun Fact:** いい (ii) is also used to express hoping for something. However, unlike ように祈る, the recipient of the hope—the person the speaker is hoping for—is determined by the use of ね (for someone else) or な (for oneself).",
  "etymology": "The structure relies on the auxiliary verb よう (yō), derived from 様 (sama), meaning 'manner' or 'style'.  When combined with the verb 祈る (inoru, to pray), it expresses a hope or prayer for a certain outcome, reflecting a wish for a particular 'manner' of events to unfold.",
