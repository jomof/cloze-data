    },
    "etymology": "「上 (ue)」 means 'above' or 'on.' 「は (wa)」 is a topic marker. The phrase implies that once something is 'on' or 'decided,' a certain consequence or obligation follows.",
    "writeup": "「上は」 is a somewhat old-fashioned expression that emphasizes that something is being done or considered as a result of a prior action or decision. It can be translated as \"once (A), (B),\" \"since (A), (B),\" \"now that (A), (B),\" or \"as long as (A), (B).\" (B) typically represents something that is deemed obvious or necessary given (A). 「上」 is a noun here, and the addition of the particle 「は」 creates a literal meaning similar to \"over and above (A), (B).\" This \"over and above\" nuance is akin to \"with that said\" or \"all things considered\" in English, presenting (A) as a finalized condition. The structure typically follows verbs in the standard form. Because 「上は」 is relatively old-fashioned, expressions like 「からには」 or 「以上は」 are more commonly heard in contemporary Japanese and convey a similar meaning. 「上は」 is often used in formal speech or writing.",
