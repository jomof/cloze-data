  "writeup": "はおろか (o-roka) is a phrase used to express the idea of 'let alone' or 'much less' in Japanese.  It's similar to the English phrase 'not to mention' or 'not only... but also...' but with a stronger emphasis on the lesser-importance of the second clause.  The first clause presents a situation, while the second clause emphasizes that an even more unexpected situation is also true.  It often conveys a sense of surprise or understatement.  The word 疎か (utsuka) itself means 'negligent' or 'careless,' but in this expression, it functions grammatically differently and is rather fixed in this phrase. The overall meaning carries a nuance of 'completely putting aside (A), (B)' with (B) usually being far more obvious or extreme than (A). This is often reinforced by using the adverbial particle さえ (sae) after the second clause.  The phrase is typically used in more formal settings.",

  "etymology": "The phrase uses 疎か (utsuka), meaning 'negligent' or 'careless'.  However, in おろか, the original meaning is somewhat altered and serves more of a grammatical function to emphasize the second clause. This illustrates how meanings can shift and adapt within set phrases in Japanese.",
