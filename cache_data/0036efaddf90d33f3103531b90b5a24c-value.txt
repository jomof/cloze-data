    "etymology": "The etymology of 再び (futatabi) is straightforward. It is composed of 二 (futa), meaning \"two,\" and 度 (tabi), meaning \"time\" or \"occurrence.\" Thus, literally, 再び means \"second time.\"",
    "writeup": "**再び (futatabi)** is an adverb that translates to \"again,\" \"once more,\" or \"a second time.\" It's used to indicate the repetition of an action or event.  A key nuance of **再び** is that it specifically implies the action is happening for the *second* time. This distinguishes it from adverbs like **また (mata)**, which can refer to repetitions beyond the second instance.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Formality:**  As indicated in the details, **再び** is considered a formal expression (**硬い - katai**). You'll encounter it more frequently in written materials such as books, articles, and formal documents than in everyday spoken Japanese.
*   **Nuance of 'Second Time':**  Keep in mind the underlying meaning of \"second time.\"  While it translates to \"again,\" it's not typically used for actions that are expected to be repeated many times.
*   **Contrast with また:** While both **再び** and **また** can mean \"again,\" **また** is much more common in casual conversation and can refer to any instance of repetition. **再び** carries a more specific and formal connotation of the second occurrence.
*   **Placement:**  **再び** usually appears at the beginning of a sentence or clause, setting the context for the repeated action.",
