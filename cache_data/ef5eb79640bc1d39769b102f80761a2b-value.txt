  "writeup": "The verb はじめる (hajimeru) means \"to start\" or \"to begin.\"  It's a versatile verb used across various contexts and registers.  We attach はじめる to the masu-stem of other verbs to indicate the commencement of an action. For example,  歌を歌う (uta o utau) means \"to sing a song.\" To say \"to start singing a song,\" we use 歌を歌い始める (uta o utaihajimeru). The kanji form 始める can be used interchangeably with the hiragana version はじめる without changing the meaning.  This grammar point allows for expressing different tenses by conjugating はじめる itself, showing actions that will start, are starting, or have started.  It's crucial to distinguish はじめる (transitive) from 始まる (hajimeru - intransitive), which indicates something starting on its own accord.  We use the transitive form because the action being started is being initiated by something or someone.",
  "etymology": "始める (hajimeru) is composed of the verb 始める (hajimeru) which means to start, which in turn contains  始 (haji), meaning \"beginning\" or \"start\", and める (-meru), a verb suffix indicating a change of state. The combination literally means \"to cause something to begin.\"",
