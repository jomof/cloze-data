  "etymology": "This expression combines the past tense marker た (ta) with こと (koto, 'thing'), が (ga, subject marker), and ある (aru, 'to exist').  The past tense marker applied to the verb stem indicates a completed action, while こと nominalizes the verb, making it the subject of ある.  The entire phrase indicates the existence of a past experience.",
  "writeup": "たことがある (ta koto ga aru) is a crucial expression for indicating past experiences.  It literally translates to \"there is a fact that [you] did [something] in the past.\"  The structure is quite fixed:  past-tense verb stem + た (ta) + こと (koto) + が (ga) + ある (aru).  Note that こと cannot be replaced with の in this construction.  The negative form, たことがない (ta koto ga nai), means \"have never done [something] before.\" This phrase is versatile and used across registers, adjusting formality through polite verb conjugations (ございます).",
