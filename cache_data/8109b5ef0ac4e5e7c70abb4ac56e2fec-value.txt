  "writeup": "The expression に基づいて (ni motozuite) is used to indicate that something is 'based on' or 'in accordance with' something else.  It's a combination of the particle に (ni), the verb 基づく (motozuku, 'to be based on'), and the -て form (te-form). This construction emphasizes the basis or foundation upon which a judgment or conclusion is made.  The noun or noun phrase representing the basis precedes に基づいて, followed by the statement of the judgment or conclusion.  The past tense form, に基づいた (ni motozuita), can be used directly before a noun to show that this noun is based upon another noun.  For example,  「歴史的事実に基づいた映画」 (rekishi-teki jitsui ni motozuita eiga) means \"a movie based on historical facts.\"  The kanji 基 (ki) means 'foundation,' underscoring the inherent sense of origin or derivation. Thus, に基づいて can also imply 'produced from,' 'created from,' or 'invented based on.'",
  "etymology": "The phrase に基づいて is composed of three parts: に (ni), a particle indicating the target or basis; 基づく (motozuku), a verb meaning \"to be based on,\" which itself derives from the kanji 基 (ki, foundation) and づく (zuku, a suffix indicating a state or action); and て (te), the te-form indicating a continuous or completed action in this context.",
