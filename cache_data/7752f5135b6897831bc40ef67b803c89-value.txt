    "[Noun] + を + 通じて": "Indicates a medium or process through which something happens.",
    "[Noun] + を + 通して": "Indicates a means or method by which something is accomplished."
  },
  "etymology": "Both particles are derived from the verb 通る (tooru) meaning \"to pass through.\"  を通じて (tsuujite) uses the て-form of the verb + the gerund particle て, implying a process or medium.  を通して (tsuushite) uses the て-form + the particle を, suggesting a more direct or intentional means.",
  "writeup": "を通じて (tsuujite) andを通して (tsuushite) are nuanced particles indicating \"through\" or \"via.\"  While often interchangeable, subtle differences exist.  Think of it this way:  through (A), (B) happens.  'A' is the method or means.  The choice depends on whether the action is more of a process (tsuujite) or a deliberate act (tsuushite).  For instance, learning Japanese through anime is a process (tsuujite), while achieving success through hard work is a deliberate action (tsuushite). Both particles are post-nominal, appearing after the noun they modify.  Mastering this subtle distinction enhances your natural fluency.",
