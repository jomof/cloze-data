  "etymology": "The grammar point 「ったら」 is derived from the conditional form 「～たら」, implying a hypothetical situation that evokes a strong emotional response. 「といったら」 is a variation of 「ったら」, adding 「と言う」 (to say) for emphasis, further highlighting the speaker's inability to articulate the intensity of the situation.",
  "writeup": "「ったら」 and 「といったら」 are set expressions used to emphasize a very high degree of something, often to the point where it's difficult to express in words. It conveys a sense of astonishment, disappointment, or frustration. Unlike simple descriptions, these expressions imply the speaker is overwhelmed by the situation. 「といったら」 is generally used in negative contexts, often following words that indicate something is outrageous, absurd, shameful, or pathetic. 「と言ったらありはない」 is a less common, more literary variant.",
