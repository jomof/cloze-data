    "etymology": "The verb 「知る (shiru)」 has ancient roots in the Japanese language, tracing back to the Old Japanese period. Its core meaning has consistently revolved around gaining awareness or knowledge of something. The kanji 「知」 itself is a phono-semantic compound, combining the meaning component 「矢」 (arrow, representing directness or clarity) and the phonetic component 「口」 (mouth, representing verbal communication). This suggests that knowing something involves clear and direct communication or understanding.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「知る (shiru)」 means \"to know\" or \"to get to know\". It's crucial to remember that 「知る」 describes the **action of becoming aware** or gaining knowledge. To express the state of knowing something, you'll typically use the 「～ている」 form, 「知っている」, which is similar to \"to know\" in English. It's an important distinction. Also, 「知る」 can indicate discovering a fact, event, or piece of information. Be mindful of the particle usage: 「～を」 for knowing a specific thing and 「～ことを」 or 「～ということを」 for knowing a fact or event. Also be mindful that 「知る」 is different than 「分かる」: 「知る」 refers to being acquainted with facts or information. 「分かる」 means understanding the reason or meaning behind something.",
