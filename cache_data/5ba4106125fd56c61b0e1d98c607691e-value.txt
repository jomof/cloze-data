  "writeup": "「がある」(ga aru) is a fundamental grammatical construction in Japanese, combining the topic marker particle が (ga) and the verb ある (aru).  This signifies the existence of something, translating to 'there is' or 'there are' in English.  Crucially, it's used primarily for inanimate objects or concepts.  The verb ある (aru) is an irregular *u*-verb; note that its negative form is ない (nai), not *araranai*. The polite form is あります (arimasu).  Mastering this simple yet essential phrase is key to expressing existence in Japanese.  The kanji form, 有る, is common and should be learned early.  There's no semantic difference between using the kanji or hiragana/katakana.",
  "etymology": "The verb ある (aru) originates from a Proto-Japonic root signifying existence. Its irregular conjugation reflects its ancient status within the language, highlighting its deep-seated role in expressing existence. The particle が (ga) emphasizes the topic of the sentence, making the existence of the object clear.",
