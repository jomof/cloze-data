  "writeup": "The Japanese grammar point \"切れない\" (kirenai) is a negative potential form expressing the inability to complete an action.  It's formed by taking the -masu stem of a verb and adding the negative potential suffix -nai.  It doesn't simply mean \"not cutting,\" but rather \"unable to finish cutting\" or more generally, \"unable to complete.\"  The nuance often implies an excess of something preventing completion—too much food, too many stars, etc.  It can also suggest an inability to complete something to one's satisfaction.  This subtle difference is crucial to understand its usage.  Let's explore this further through examples.",
  "etymology": "切れない (kirenai) derives from the verb 切る (kiru), meaning \"to cut.\"  The  -nai form indicates a negative potential, implying a lack of ability to complete the action of cutting or, by extension, any action to its completion. The 'kire' portion comes from the -masu stem of 'kiru'. The addition of '-nai' creates the negative potential.",
