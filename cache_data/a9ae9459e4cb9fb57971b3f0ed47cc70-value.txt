  "writeup": "This grammar point, \"そういう,\"  is a fascinating example of how seemingly simple Japanese phrases can have deep roots and subtle nuances.  It literally translates to \"saying that,\"  but its function is more akin to \"that kind of,\" \"like that,\" or \"such.\"  It's formed from そう (sō, 'like that') and いう (iu, 'say').  The 'そう' part belongs to the demonstrative family (こそあど言葉), related to words like これ (kore, 'this'), それ (sore, 'that'), and あれ (are, 'that over there').  This family demonstrates the intricate way Japanese uses context and demonstratives to convey meaning, something we'll explore further in later lessons.  Importantly,  'そういう' always precedes the noun it modifies, functioning as a pre-noun adjectival phrase. Keep in mind that そう as an adverb is distinct from そう as an auxiliary verb.  They share a similar meaning, representing the concept of 'so,' 'in that way,' etc., but are grammatically distinct.",
  "etymology": "The word \"そういう\" (sōiu) is a compound word composed of \"そう\" (sō) and \"いう\" (iu).  \"そう\" (sō) originates from the old demonstrative pronoun 'そ' and is related to 'それ' (sore, 'that'), indicating something previously mentioned or contextually understood.  \"いう\" (iu) is the verb 'to say,' adding a layer of indirect reference.  Therefore, \"そういう\" implies a description referencing something previously established.  The modern usage has moved away from the literal 'saying' aspect, emphasizing the descriptive nature of the phrase.",

      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "interrogative",

      "japanese": "どういう意味ですか。",
      "english": "What do you mean?",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "interrogative",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The speaker is attempting to be flirty with the use of 「そういう服を着て」 (sōiu fuku o kite),  commenting on the listener's appearance. The use of 「ませんか？」 (masen ka) is a polite but more forward way of posing an invitation. Note the use of  「私と」 (watashi to), the addition of the speaker emphasizes the personal connection."

  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the choice of これ (kore), それ (sore), あれ (are), and どれ (dore) influences the overall context and meaning.  The flexibility of 'そういう' lies in its ability to seamlessly adapt to different registers and situations, making it a valuable tool in everyday Japanese conversation.",

      "term": "そんな・こんな・あんな・どんな",
      "meaning": "Such a・Kind of, Something like ~",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike そういう, which focuses on the type or kind of something, そんな, こんな, あんな, and どんな emphasize the degree or quantity, often expressing surprise, doubt, or exaggeration.  They are more emphatic than そういう."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in emphasis. そういう describes the type or kind, while そんな etc. describe the extent or quantity. To avoid confusion, consider the level of emphasis and the specific nuance you wish to convey.  Is it the *type* that matters (use そういう), or the *degree* (use そんな etc.)?"
