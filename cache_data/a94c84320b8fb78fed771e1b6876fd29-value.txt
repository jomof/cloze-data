  "writeup": "めったに～ない is a common Japanese expression used to convey the idea of something happening rarely or seldom.  It literally translates to 'rarely ~ not,' but it's best understood as a single unit expressing infrequency.  The core component, 滅多 (めった), is an archaic adjective meaning 'reckless' or 'thoughtless.'  This original meaning subtly influences the nuance of めったに～ない, suggesting that the action is not done casually or without reason. While it's typically paired with a negative verb, it can sometimes modify a noun or phrase, with は often used.  It's far more common to see めったに written in hiragana than in kanji, although both forms are acceptable.  Using the kanji form adds a slightly more formal touch.  This expression is equally applicable across genders and age groups.",
  "etymology": "The word めった (metta) originates from the adjective 滅多 (metta), meaning 'reckless' or 'thoughtless'.  When used in the phrase めったに～ない, the 'recklessness' aspect implies that the action doesn't happen casually or without specific cause, adding a slight layer of emphasis to the rarity.",
