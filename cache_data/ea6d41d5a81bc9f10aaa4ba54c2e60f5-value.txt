    "writeup": "The grammar point 「甲斐がある」 expresses that something is \"worth doing\" or \"pays off.\" 「甲斐」 itself means \"worth\" or \"effect.\" It's often used after verbs or nouns to indicate that an action or effort was worthwhile. You'll often see it in hiragana as 「かい」 or 「がい」.  When following verbs, 「がい」 is used after the ます-stem, indicating a general sense of worth. 「かい」 can follow any standard form, emphasizing the tense of the verb. 「甲斐がない」 means something is \"not worth doing.\"",
