  "writeup": "よう な 気 が する (yōna kigasuru) is a common phrase expressing a hunch or suspicion.  It literally translates to \"have a feeling like,\" but conveys a sense of uncertainty or intuition rather than a firm belief. The よう (yō) particle indicates a resemblance or similarity, softening the assertion. 気 が する (kigasuru) means \"to have a feeling.\" Combining them creates a nuanced expression ideal for situations where you're not entirely sure but suspect something might be true.  This construction is versatile and used across various registers, though overly emphatic usage might sound slightly informal.  The phrase uses the attributive form of the preceding word, followed by よう and then 気 が する.  For example, if you want to say 'It seems like it will rain', you need to use the attributive form of 雨 (ame), which is 雨の (amenoyo),  and you would say 雨のようだ気がする (amenoyo yōna kigasuru).",
  "etymology": "The phrase is a combination of two elements: よう (yō), derived from the verb ようだ (yōda) meaning 'to seem,' and 気 が する (kigasuru), an idiomatic expression indicating a feeling or intuition.  The よう particle softens the statement, making it less assertive.",
