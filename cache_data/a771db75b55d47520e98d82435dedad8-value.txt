    "etymology": "The term 'い-adjective' comes from the fact that these adjectives always end in the hiragana character い. Predicate refers to the function of the adjective in the sentence, acting as the descriptor or statement about the subject.",
    "writeup": "A predicate is a word that describes the topic/subject of a sentence. The Japanese equivalent of this is a 述語 (jutsugo), which literally means \"statement word.\" As a predicate, い-adjectives can appear by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used at the end of a sentence.\n\nWhen there are no other words apart from the adjective itself, it comes across similar to \"It's cute\" or \"It's hot\" and similar expressions in English. We just have to guess what the \"it\" is from context.\n\nIn many sentences, either は or が could be used to mark the word/words that the predicate is describing. However, which one sounds more natural will depend on many factors. In general, if you are specifically pointing out something as being different from other things in the same category, が will be used.\n\nAll い-adjectives are words of Japanese origin.",
