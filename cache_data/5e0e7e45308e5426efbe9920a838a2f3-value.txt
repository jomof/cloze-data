  "writeup": "The phrase 途中 (tochū) means \"on the way\" or \"in the middle.\"  Adding に (ni) or で (de) specifies whether the action happens *during* the journey (に) or *because of* the journey or circumstance (で).  に emphasizes the time or duration, while で emphasizes the process or the journey itself as the cause or opportunity for something else to happen. The distinction can be subtle, requiring careful observation of numerous examples to grasp fully. 途中 often follows verbs in their plain form or nouns modified by の (no).",

      "term": "最中に",
      "meaning": "In the middle of",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike 途中に/途中で, which implies a journey or process, 最中に focuses on the interruption of an action or event, often in a more abrupt and unexpected way.  最中に is often used with a more intense action happening, whereas 途中 implies a more commonplace event."

      "meaning": "In the process of doing ~ right now/at this moment",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "ているところだ emphasizes the ongoing state of an action, whereas 途中に/途中で highlights an event happening during a larger process or journey.  This emphasizes that the action is happening at this very moment."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, carefully consider the context. If the emphasis is on the interruption of an action, 最中に is preferred. If the focus is on an event happening *while* something else is already underway, and at the start or the middle, then 途中 is best. がけに is more suitable when the event occurs as soon as something else begins, and ているところだ is used only when the action is actively ongoing."
