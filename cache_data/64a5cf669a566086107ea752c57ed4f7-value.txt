    "etymology": "「できれば」and「できたら」both come from the potential form of the verb 「できる」(dekiru), meaning \"to be able to do\" or \"can do\". The「-ば」form (conditional) and 「-たら」form (past conditional) add the nuance of \"if it is possible\".",
    "writeup": "「できれば」 and 「できたら」 are used to express a desire or preference, indicating that something is wished for if it is feasible. Both translate to \"if possible\" and are interchangeable in most contexts. They are typically placed at the beginning of a sentence. Both 「できれば」and 「できたら」imply a polite request or a softened statement of preference.",
