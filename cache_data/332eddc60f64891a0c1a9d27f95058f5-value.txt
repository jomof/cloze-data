  "etymology": "けど is a shortened, more casual form of けれども (keredomo). けれども itself is derived from the verb 蹴る (keru, \"to kick\") + the auxiliary verb ども (domo, expressing concession). Over time, けれども became more common, and けど evolved as a further simplification.",
  "writeup": "けど is a conjunctive particle functioning to connect two parts of a sentence (A and B), similar to が. It conveys a sense of \"while thinking about A, B,\" often translated as \"but\" or \"however\" in English. When けど follows a な-adjective or a noun, だ is required (hence だけど). It's a more modern and casual version of けれども, and exists on a spectrum of formality: Casual: けど, けども, けれど, けれども, が: Formal. The phrase after けど can be omitted if it's obvious or the speaker doesn't want to explicitly state it. This grammar point is gender neutral.",
