    "etymology": "The noun 「為(ため)」 originally meant 'sake' or 'purpose'. When used with 「に」, it indicates the reason or cause for something. Over time, it evolved to express 'due to' or 'because of', especially when combined with past-tense verbs.",
    "writeup": "The word 「ため」 (為 in kanji) originally meant \"sake\" in English, and is used as a dependent noun. It means something is being done in light of, or as a result of, some other thing. The particle 「に」 is added to ため to show that A is a goal being reached. 「ために」 is often used with verbs in the past tense, to show that something happened 'due to A'. 「ために」 means 'in light of (A)', or 'as a result of (A)', to indicate that (A) is the primary event leading to (B). To use 「ために」 as 'in light of', 'as a result of', or 'because of', attach it to the end of a verb in its past form, a noun followed by 「の」, or an adjective. It may be used after い-adjectives in their dictionary form, or な-adjectives in their attributive form (な). This 'in light of (A)' nuance can be used to reference things that have already happened, or to express the purpose of an action.",
