  "writeup": "か〜ないかのうちに is a slightly formal grammar structure used to indicate a precise point in time where the action of (A) is uncertain—whether it started or finished. It emphasizes the exact moment before or after (A) commences. This structure consists of か, ない, か, の, the noun 内 ('within'), and に. Literally, it means 'while not knowing whether (A) or not (A), (B)'. The verb before か and ないか must be repeated and can be in its dictionary form. Standard translations include 'right after (A)', 'as soon as (A)', and 'barely when (A)'.  It can also highlight relatively short periods where something happens, often a positive or negative occurrence unexpectedly quick.  This construction isn't typically used in casual conversation.",
  "etymology": "The core of this phrase lies in the combination of か (ka - question particle), ない (nai - negative), and の (no - possessive particle).  The phrase effectively creates a sense of immediacy by framing the event (B) within the uncertain timeframe of event (A).  The use of 内 (uchi - inside, within) further emphasizes the close temporal proximity.",
