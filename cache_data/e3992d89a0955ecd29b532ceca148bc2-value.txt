    "etymology": "としても is derived from として 'as' and も 'even'. The addition of も adds the nuance of 'even in the capacity of' or 'even if we consider it as'.",
    "writeup": "としても is used to express thoughts about (A), assuming it to be true, or to indicate that even within the scope of (A), a certain outcome (B) will occur. It can be translated as \"even if we assume that it's (A)\" or \"assuming that (A).\" Literally, it conveys something like \"even going off the premise that it were (A), (B)\". The speaker uses it to express that, for the sake of argument, they are willing to accept (A) as true before giving their thoughts on that hypothetical situation.\n\nとしても follows verbs and い-adjectives directly. With nouns and な-adjectives, it follows だ. Sometimes older speakers add だ for emphasis, creating としてもだ.\n\nIn some cases, としても functions as an extension of として 'as', and can be interpreted as 'even as (A)'. This usage primarily highlights people or organizations in the position of (A), stating that 'even for (A), it will still be (B)'. In this case, としても is only used with nouns.",
