    "etymology": "The word 且つ originates from classical Chinese and retains a formal nuance in modern Japanese. Its kanji, 且, suggests addition or supplementing, which aligns with its conjunctive function.",
    "writeup": "**且つ (katsu)** is a formal conjunction meaning \"and,\" \"and also,\" or \"moreover.\" It's primarily used in formal writing and speech to connect words, phrases, or sentences, emphasizing a sense of addition or continuation. It has a more sophisticated feel than more common conjunctions like **と (to)** or **そして (soshite)**. Think of it as a literary \"and furthermore.\" \n\nIt can connect various parts of speech and sentence structures, as the formation details above show. It's especially common in legal, academic, and business contexts where precision and formality are valued. It can connect verb stems, negative verb forms, adjectives, nouns, and even entire phrases or sentences.",
