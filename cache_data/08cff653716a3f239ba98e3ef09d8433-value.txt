  "writeup": "The suffix ずくめ (zukume) is a fascinating addition to the Japanese language, carrying a strong emphasis on completeness and exclusivity.  It essentially means \"completely (A)\", \"all (A)\", or \"nothing but (A)\".  It's typically attached directly to nouns, conveying the idea that (A) dominates the situation to such an extent that everything else is insignificant.  When ずくめ modifies a noun directly, the particle の is inserted between them (e.g., 仕事のずくめ).  While it can be used in both positive and negative contexts,  it's predominantly found in set expressions or established phrases.  Therefore, it's best used with combinations you've already encountered in Japanese media or conversation.  It's important to note that ずくめ is a more modern and preferred form over the older づくめ, which is mostly considered archaic.  A related, but distinct, suffix is づくし (zukushi), which means \"all sorts/kinds of (A)\", suggesting a variety rather than a singular focus.  The difference is subtle but crucial for accurate expression.  Mastering this nuance will enhance your ability to convey the precise degree of completeness or pervasiveness.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while ずくめ can be used creatively, it's best employed within familiar expressions or contexts.  Overuse can sound unnatural. Pay close attention to the nuance conveyed by the combination of the noun and ずくめ, as the overall meaning is dependent on this interplay.",
  "etymology": "ずくめ ultimately derives from the verb 尽くす (tsukusu), meaning \"to exhaust,\" \"to use up completely,\" or \"to do one's best.\"  The suffix め (-me) is an older, somewhat archaic intensifier.  The modern preference for ず (zu) over づ (du) reflects orthographic changes in the Japanese writing system."
