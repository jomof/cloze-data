    "etymology": "どうやら is derived from どう (how) and やら, a particle indicating uncertainty about specific things or a list. It emphasizes that the speaker isn't entirely sure about something, similar to adding \"or whatever\" or \"or some such\" in English.",
    "writeup": "どうやら can be translated as \"apparently,\" \"it seems like,\" or \"looks like,\" and expresses speculation. It's used similarly to ようだ, そうだ, and らしい, strengthening the uncertainty the speaker already feels. Like many adverbs expressing amount or speculation, どうやら usually appears at the beginning of a sentence, modifying the entire phrase. Think of it as adding \"in some way it seems like...\" to express doubt.",
