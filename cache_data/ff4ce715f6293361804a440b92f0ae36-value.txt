    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of 「と」, the quotative particle, and 「聞いた」, the past tense of 「聞く」 (kiku), meaning \"to hear.\" Thus, it literally translates to \"I heard that.\"",
    "writeup": "「ときいた」 is used to convey information that the speaker has heard from an external source. It is composed of the particle 「と」, used to mark direct quotes or content, and the past tense form of the verb 「聞く」 (to hear), 「聞いた」. Therefore, 「ときいた」 translates directly to \"I heard that.\" Note that in casual speech, the copula 「だ」 is often omitted after nouns and na-adjectives, although this is technically incorrect.",
