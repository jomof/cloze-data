  "writeup": "何といっても (nani to itte mo) is an idiomatic expression meaning \"by any account,\" \"all the same,\" or \"no doubt.\"  It's used to emphasize a particular point, often highlighting a positive aspect of something.  The literal translation, \"even whatever one says,\" hints at its function: it presents a conclusion that stands regardless of other factors.  It's primarily used at the beginning of sentences. While generally used in positive contexts, it can occasionally convey a negative nuance, though this is less common. The phrase's structure is quite straightforward, combining 何 (nani) 'what,' と (to) - the te-form of 言う (iu) 'to say,' and も (mo) 'even.'  The pronunciation shift from 何に (nani ni) to 何に (nani ni) is a natural elision found in spoken Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's strength lies in its combination of elements.  何 (nani), meaning 'what' or 'whatever,' suggests a broad scope of possible arguments.  と (to), the te-form of 言う (iu), implies a statement or opinion.  Finally, も (mo) emphasizes inclusiveness – 'even' this thing holds true. Thus, the overall meaning emphasizes a statement's unassailable truth.",
