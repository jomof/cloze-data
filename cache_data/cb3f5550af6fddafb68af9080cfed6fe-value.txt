  "writeup": "The suffix  `にくい` (nikui) transforms a verb's masu-stem into an `い`-adjective, signifying \"difficult to.\"  Unlike `づらい` (zurui), which implies difficulty due to unpleasantness or intolerability, `にくい` emphasizes difficulty stemming from skill, complexity, or inherent properties of the task itself.  Think of it as indicating something challenging because of required expertise or the nature of the action.  For example,  \"難しい\" (muzukashii) – difficult – shares a similar root, reinforcing this sense of inherent challenge. The adjective `にくい` is attached directly to the masu-stem of the verb.",
  "etymology": "The suffix にくい is etymologically related to the word 難しい (muzukashii), meaning difficult.  Both share a common root indicating difficulty related to a skill or inherent characteristic.",
