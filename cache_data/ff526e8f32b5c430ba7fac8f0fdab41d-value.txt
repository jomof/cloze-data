    "writeup": "The particle 「より」 indicates a point of origin, be it physical, temporal, or comparative. Think of it as marking \"from\" or \"than.\" It's versatile, appearing with verbs of motion, comparisons, and range indications. 「より」 is frequently paired with 「から」, another particle indicating origin, but 「より」 often carries a stronger sense of comparison or degree. For example, you might say 「東京**より**大阪のほうが好きです」 meaning \"I like Osaka more **than** Tokyo.\"",
    "etymology": "「より」 originates from the verb 「寄る (yoru)」, meaning \"to approach\" or \"to come near.\" This etymology hints at its function of indicating a starting point or basis from which something originates or is being measured.",
