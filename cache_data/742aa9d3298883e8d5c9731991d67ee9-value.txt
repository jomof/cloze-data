    },
    "etymology": "「だから」 means \"therefore\" or \"so.\" 「と」 is a particle indicating a quote or condition. 「言って」 is the te-form of 「言う」 (iu), meaning \"to say.\" Thus, the phrase literally means \"even if you say 'therefore,'\" implying a contrast or exception to the expected consequence.",
    "writeup": "「だからと言って」 is a conjunction used to express that even if a certain premise is true, the expected conclusion does not necessarily follow. It's similar to saying \"but that doesn't mean...\" or \"just because... doesn't mean...\" in English. It is often used to counter a potential assumption based on the preceding statement. Sentences following 「だからと言って」 often end with 「わけではない」 (it's not the case that...) or 「とは限らない」 (it's not necessarily the case that...). It is suitable for formal and informal settings.",
