  "writeup": "ところで is a conjunction particle formed from the noun ところ, meaning 'place,' and the particle で.  It functions similarly to 'by the way' or 'incidentally' in English, introducing a new, unrelated topic.  Crucially, it's used to shift the conversation, not to continue within the same line of thought.  You'll typically find ところで at the beginning of a sentence, preceding a statement or question about a completely different subject.  The literal translation, closer to 'and with that,' hints at a connection; something in the prior conversation triggered the speaker's recollection of this new topic.  Important Consideration: When ところで follows the past tense of a verb (e.g., たところで), its meaning changes significantly, indicating that something is not the case despite a previous circumstance. We'll delve into this more advanced usage later.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of ところで is straightforward.  ところ is an ancient word indicating a location or circumstance.  The particle で adds a sense of context or occasion, resulting in a phrase that means 'in that circumstance' or 'on that topic'.  This explains its function in introducing a shift in conversation.",

    {
      "japanese": "ところで、今日の会議はどうでしたか？",
      "english": "By the way, how was today's meeting?",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a neutral sentence appropriate for a professional setting. The 「ところで」 smoothly transitions to a new topic related to work."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ところで、週末は何か予定がありますか？",
      "english": "Incidentally, do you have any plans for the weekend?",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses 「ところで」 to shift from a previous topic to a more casual and friendly one about weekend plans. The question is polite but not overly formal."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ところで、あのね…　あなたのこと、ずっと気になってたの。",
      "english": "By the way, um… I've been thinking about you a lot.",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「あのね…」 is very intimate and typical of female speech.  It adds a shy, endearing quality, making the flirtatious confession more palatable. The 「ずっと気になってたの」 itself is already flirtatious, hinting at romantic interest, but it's made even softer by the preceding 「ところで、あのね…」"
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ところで、君の好きな食べ物は？今度一緒に食べに行こうよ。",
      "english": "By the way, what's your favorite food?  Let's go eat together sometime.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The casual register and the proposition 「一緒に食べに行こうよ」 clearly signal a romantic interest.  Using 「君」 instead of 「あなた」 reinforces the informal and potentially flirty tone.  The sentence structure is simple and direct, showing confidence. The 「ところで」 is used as a casual conversational transition."

    {
      "japanese": "ところで、あの映画、面白かった？",
      "english": "By the way, did you enjoy that movie?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a casual conversation starter, perfectly suited to a friendly exchange. The 「ところで」 serves as a natural bridge to a new topic."

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is perfectly acceptable among peers in an academic setting. The 「ところで」 naturally transitions the conversation to the relevant topic. The 「だって」 is a casual way of emphasizing the known information."

      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike ところで, which introduces a completely new topic, そういえば implies a connection to the previous conversation.  It's more like 'speaking of which' or 'come to think of it.'"

    {
      "term": "といえば",
      "meaning": "Speaking of, If it were the case that",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "といえば is more nuanced and can also mean 'speaking of...'  However, it often implies a comparison or contrasting point, which is different from ところで's simple topic shift."
    }

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the implied connection to the previous conversation.  ところで suggests a completely fresh topic, while そういえば and といえば hint at a connection or comparison. Choose carefully based on the context."
