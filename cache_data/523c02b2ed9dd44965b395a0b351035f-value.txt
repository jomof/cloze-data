  "writeup": "更に (sarani) is an adverbial particle often used to convey 'even more,' 'further,' 'again,' or 'more and more.'  This usage extends from the kanji 更 (sarau), meaning 'to change' or 'to approach a change.'  Therefore, 更に always modifies something progressing beyond an initial state—be it time, quantity, or intensity.  Consequently, 'in addition to' can also be a fitting translation in certain contexts.  Because it functions adverbially, 更に typically appears at the beginning of a sentence's latter part, after the base information is established.  Interestingly, the idea of 'approaching change' implies a prior state of 'fullness'—the point where adding more fundamentally alters the situation. Thus, 更に often implies that the initial state is already complete or sufficient, and the subsequent event pushes beyond a critical threshold. This threshold can be positive or negative, entirely dependent on the sentence's context.",
  "etymology": "The word 更に comes from the kanji 更 (sarau), meaning \"to change\" or \"to renew,\" and に (ni), a particle indicating direction or destination.  Thus, 更に literally suggests a progression towards a further change or renewal. This etymology nicely reflects the nuanced sense of 'going beyond' implied in its usage. The fact that the meaning of 更indicates a preceding 'fullness' leading to a change gives this word its characteristic implication of exceeding a threshold.",

      "japanese": "電気代が**更に**高くなった。",
      "english": "The electricity bill has become even more expensive.",
      "register": "standard",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses plain form, which is appropriate for standard, informative conversation.  There's nothing inherently gendered or age-specific about the statement itself.  「電気代」 (electricity bill) is a neutral topic."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼は**更に**勉強して医者になった。",
      "english": "He studied even further and became a doctor.",
      "register": "standard",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Again, plain form is used, keeping the statement neutral and suitable for everyday conversation.  The sentence structure is straightforward and doesn't imply any specific age or gender for the speaker or listener.  「医者」 (doctor) is gender-neutral."

      "japanese": "このケーキは美味しいけど、**更に**生クリームをかけたらもっと美味しいよ！",

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence is casual, using the informal \"よ\" at the end. It would likely be used between friends, conveying enthusiasm. The politeness level is low. No specific age or gender implications are present.  The use of 「もっと」 (more) reinforces the idea of exceeding a threshold."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あのね、君のことが**更に**好きになった。",
      "english": "You know, I've come to like you even more.",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses intimate language, \"あのね\" (you know), which is very casual.  The choice of words and the implied intimacy are crucial to the flirty nature of the statement. 「君のことが」 (about you) is a subtle but effective way to express affection.  The male speaker's use of this kind of language towards a female listener is essential to the success of this flirtation."

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The informal 「な」 ending and the use of 「もっと」 (more) create a gentle, inviting tone, perfectly suited for a first encounter. The female speaker's use of these gentler, more feminine terms shows interest but does not come across as over-eager.   The phrasing 「あなたの笑顔」 (your smile) directly expresses the positive effect the listener has on the speaker."

      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses a conditional structure suggesting further potential. The polite yet professional tone is appropriate for a workplace setting. There are no inherent gender or age restrictions here. The 「だろう」 (だろう) ending adds a level of polite uncertainty, suitable for group discussion."

Other words like ますます, 再び, また, 上に, その上, and しかも, while sometimes overlapping in meaning, lack this specific nuance of exceeding a threshold.  Consider the context carefully to choose the most accurate and natural-sounding word."
