  "writeup": "The sentence-ending particle \"かい\" is a casual, primarily masculine way to ask a question in Japanese.  It's not a single word, but a combination of か (ka, a standard question marker) and い (i), a less common particle adding emphasis and a slightly rough, informal tone.  \"かい\" typically follows the word or phrase being questioned.  With verbs and い-adjectives, の (no) may optionally be added before かい, often shortened to ん (n).  For な-adjectives and nouns, the optional の is often replaced by なん (nan), a shortened form of なの (nano).  While these additions are grammatically correct, they're frequently omitted in casual speech due to the already informal nature of かい.  Generally, かい is used for simple yes/no questions.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* Because \"かい\" is very casual and direct, it can easily sound like an accusation if not used with appropriate tone and context.  Be mindful of your demeanor when using it. \n* This particle is predominantly used by men, and using it as a woman might sound unnatural or even slightly abrasive depending on context.\n* Given the informality, avoid using it with superiors or in formal settings.\n\n**Etymology:** The particle かい is a combination of the sentence-final particle か and the sentence-final particle い.  The particle か is an ancient sentence-final particle and its origins are obscure. The particle い is also an ancient sentence-final particle. Its use today is limited, and restricted largely to this masculine question marker.",

Choose か for polite or formal questions; use かい only when the situation calls for extremely casual speech, keeping in mind the implications of its gendered nature."
