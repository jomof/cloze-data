  "writeup": "だろう, often shortened to だろ in casual speech, is a versatile particle expressing the speaker's assumption or expectation of something being true.  It's akin to saying \"Right?\", \"Probably,\" or \"Isn't it?\" in English. While semantically identical to its polite counterpart, でしょう, だろう carries a more casual and, some would say, masculine tone due to its derivation from the informal だ (to be).  It suggests a shared understanding or agreement between speaker and listener.  However, be cautious:  while typically used when the speaker possesses supporting evidence, だろう can also convey a less confident hunch or feeling.  The speaker's intonation plays a significant role in determining the degree of certainty expressed. Importantly, だろう is primarily used in present/future contexts.  The past tense forms, だったろう and だったでしょう, exist but are far less frequent in everyday conversation.",
  "etymology": "だろう is a contraction of だ (da, a copula) and ろう (rou), which is itself a contraction of  であろう (dearou). であろう is an older form of the conditional form of である (to be).  The contraction reflects the evolution of Japanese towards more concise expressions.",

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "nuance": "The question 「これはお菓子だろう？」 is a casual way to confirm something the speaker suspects. The rising intonation at the end emphasizes the seeking of agreement."

      "english": "He'll probably be late, right?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "predictive",
      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "nuance": "The use of 「あいつ」 (that guy) indicates a casual relationship between speaker and listener, and the addition of ね softens the statement, implying a degree of shared assumption."
