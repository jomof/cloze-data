  "writeup": "The adverb まず (mazu) means \"firstly,\" \"to begin with,\" or \"to start with.\"  It's a versatile word used to introduce the initial step in a sequence of actions or points in a discussion.  Its core meaning stems from the kanji 先 (saki), signifying 'before' or 'ahead.'  Unlike words like 一番 (ichiban, first place), 最初 (saisho, very first), or 一位 (ichii, first rank), まず emphasizes the order of actions rather than their ranking or importance.  Therefore, it's suitable when outlining steps in a process.  However, be mindful that using まず can sometimes sound like giving advice, so it's best to pair it with polite language or soften the suggestion with phrases like と思う (to omou, 'I think').",
  "etymology": "まず (mazu) is derived from the word 先ず (mazu), which uses the kanji 先 (saki, meaning \"before\" or \"ahead\"). The modern usage has dropped the second character, but the original meaning remains.",
