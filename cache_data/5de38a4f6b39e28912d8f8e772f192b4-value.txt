    "etymology": "The grammar point 「傾向がある」 is composed of 「傾向(けいこう)」 (keikou), meaning 'trend' or 'tendency,' and 「がある」 (ga aru), meaning 'to exist' or 'to have.' Thus, it literally means 'there is a tendency.'",
    "writeup": "「傾向がある」 is a slightly formal grammar pattern used when indicating that there is some sort of \"trend\" or \"tendency\" existing within (A). Being a combination of the noun 「傾向」 'inclination', and 「がある」 'to have', the literal meaning is almost identical to the standard English interpretation. As 「傾向」 itself is a noun, this structure may appear after verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives (followed by な), and nouns (followed by の). Although 「がある」 is the most frequent structure seen with 「傾向」, alternatives such as 「が見られる」 'the trend of (A) can be observed' are also widely used. It should also be noted that 「傾向がある」 may be used both in instances where the trend is either positive or negative.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   「傾向がある」tends to express behaviors or characteristics (static things that aren't actively changing).\n*   「傾向にある」 focuses more on being in a state of something that is ongoing or proceeding in a certain direction, such as a declining trend.",
