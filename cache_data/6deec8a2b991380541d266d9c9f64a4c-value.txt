    "writeup": "The adverb 未だに (imadani) means \"still,\" \"not yet,\" or \"even now.\" Although stemming from the same kanji, まだ \"still\" will almost always be read as 未だ \"still\" when appearing in its kanji form. When combined with に, 未だに indicates that something is \"still (A)\" or \"not yet (A),\" depending on whether the verb it's paired with is negated. As 未だに is used adverbially, it mostly appears at the beginning of sentences. Compared to まだ, 未だに is more formal and often implies that something has continued for a much longer time, similar to adding ずっと to a standard sentence.",
    "etymology": "未だに (imadani) is derived from 未だ (mada), meaning \"not yet\" or \"still,\" combined with the particle に (ni), which adds emphasis and duration to the adverbial usage.",
