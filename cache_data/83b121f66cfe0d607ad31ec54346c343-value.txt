  "writeup": "しかも is a conjunction in Japanese, commonly translated as \"moreover\" or \"furthermore.\"  It's used in more formal contexts to connect two clauses or sentences, implying that both statements are true and often that the second adds to or reinforces the first.  Think of it as highlighting a surprising or significant addition to already established information.  The focus remains on objective facts rather than subjective opinions.  The first clause sets the stage, and the second, introduced by しかも, provides a further detail or unexpected twist.  \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n* しかも typically sits between two phrases or sentences, with the second building upon the first.\n* It's more common in writing than casual speech.\n\nEtymologically, しかも comes from a combination of the archaic interjection 然 (shika), meaning \"as such\" or \"like that,\" and the particle も (mo), meaning \"too\" or \"also.\"  This origin reflects its function of adding information in a way similar to English phrases like \"additionally.\" In modern writing, you might rarely see it as 而も (shikamo) or 併も (amatemo), but these are quite uncommon.",

  ],
  "etymology": "The etymology of しかも is fascinating. It's derived from the archaic word 然 (shika), meaning 'as such' or 'in that way,' combined with the particle も (mo), meaning 'also' or 'too.'  This highlights its function as an additive conjunction, similar to 'furthermore' or 'in addition to that' in English, amplifying a preceding statement."
