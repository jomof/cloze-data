  "writeup": "The verb 得る (eru), meaning \"to gain\" or \"to acquire,\" transforms when combined with ない (nai, \"not\") into a versatile expression of inability.  Attached to the stem of other verbs, 〜得ない conveys the nuanced sense of \"impossible to do,\"  or more precisely, \"lacking the possibility of.\" This differs from the simpler できない (dekinai, \"cannot\"), which indicates a lack of ability.  〜得ない implies that the action is inherently improbable or prevented by circumstances; there's no chance of it happening.  For example,  水と油は混ざり得ない (mizu to abura wa mazari-enai, \"Water and oil cannot mix\") highlights the inherent incompatibility. Importantly, while 得る can sometimes appear as うる (uru), an older form primarily found in literature, this older form is never used with ない.  While more formal than できる (dekiru, \"can\"),  some common expressions using 得ない are prevalent in daily Japanese, such as あり得ない (ari-enai, \"impossible\").",
  "etymology": "得る (eru) originates from an older verb form, often seen as うる (uru) in classical literature.  The modern form, eru,  is more common in modern usage. The suffix ない (nai) is a common negative suffix for verbs, attaching to the stem form to create a negative conjugation.  The combination of the stem form of eru and nai creates the nuanced meaning that it represents.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the choice between  〜得ない and できない  depends on the subtle difference in meaning.

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the context carefully.  If the inability stems from inherent limitations or circumstances, use 〜得ない.  If the inability is due to lack of skill or resources, use できない.  If there's a sense of difficulty or constraint, かねる might be a better choice.  Paying attention to these nuanced differences will make your Japanese more precise and natural."
