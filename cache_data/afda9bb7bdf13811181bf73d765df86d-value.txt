    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ようとする」 combines the volitional form of a verb (indicating intent) with 「とする」 (to try/attempt). Thus, it literally means \"to intend to try\" or \"to try intending to do something.\"",
    "writeup": "The 「ようとする」 grammar point expresses the idea of **attempting** to do something, or being **about to** do something. It combines the volitional form of a verb with 「とする」. It indicates a sense of intention and effort, but doesn't guarantee completion. It can also describe an action that was interrupted just as it was about to begin.\n\n*   **Nuance of Attempt:** The subject is actively trying to perform the action. If the attempt fails, it would be expected that the subject would reflect on why the attempt failed.\n*   **Nuance of Imminence:** The action is on the verge of happening.",
