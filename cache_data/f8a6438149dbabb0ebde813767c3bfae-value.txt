    "etymology": "「といえば」 is derived from the verb 「言う(iu)」 (to say) and the conditional particle 「ば(ba)」. Therefore, literally, it suggests \"if one were to say...\"",
    "writeup": "The expressions 「といえば」, 「と言うと」, and 「と言ったら」 are all translated closely to \"speaking of (A)\" or \"if it were the case that (A).\" Each has a slightly different nuance, but they're largely used in the same situations.\n\n*   「といえば」 - More hypothetical, \"were it (A).\"\n*   「と言うと」 - More concrete, \"if it's (A).\"\n*   「と言ったら」 - More situational, \"when it's (A).\"\n\nThese constructions are most commonly used after nouns, in response to something already mentioned in the conversation (usually by someone else). The mentioned thing often triggers someone's memory, causing them to interject with 「といえば」.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\nAlthough these phrases are used in response to something already mentioned, their purpose is to change the topic or add new information, rather than continuing on the same subject.",
