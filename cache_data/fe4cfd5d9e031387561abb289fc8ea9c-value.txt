    "writeup": "The grammar point 「どうにも〜ない」 expresses the idea that something is impossible or cannot be helped, no matter how hard one tries. It conveys a sense of futility or being at a loss. There are several common patterns:\n\n*   「どうにも + Verb (potential form, negative)」: This construction emphasizes the inability to perform an action. For example, 「どうにもできない」 means \"there is absolutely nothing one can do.\"\n*   「どうにも + Verb (masu-form) + ようがない」: This implies that there is no method or means to achieve something. For instance, 「どうにもしようがない」 means \"there's no way to do it.\"\n*   「どうにも + Noun + にならない」: This is used when something is utterly useless or doesn't amount to anything. For example, 「どうにも勉強にならない」 means \"I can't study at all.\"\n\nThis grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts to express frustration, resignation, or helplessness. Often, it is used to describe situations where one feels stuck or unable to make progress.",
    "etymology": "「どうにも」 originates from 「どう」 (how) combined with 「にも」 (even), indicating 'no matter how' or 'by any means'. 「ない」 is the negative form of 「ある」 (to be), signifying the impossibility or absence of a solution or capability.",
