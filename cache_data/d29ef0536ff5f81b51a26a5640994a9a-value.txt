  "writeup": "に照らして (ni terashite) and に照らすと (ni terasu to) are expressions built upon the verb 照らす (terasu), meaning \"to illuminate.\"  However, in these grammatical constructions, the meaning shifts significantly towards comparison and perspective.  Think of it as \"in the light of\" or \"based on.\"  The structure emphasizes the comparative aspect, presenting (B) as viewed or judged through the lens of (A). This is typically applied to situations, levels of expertise, or similar contexts.  The particle に marks (A) as the subject, acting as the 'illuminating' element. The choice between  に照らして and に照らすと subtly affects nuance, with the former being more common, especially in formal contexts.  に照らすと carries a stronger implication of a sudden realization or insight based on the comparison.",
  "etymology": "The etymology is straightforward. It derives directly from the verb 照らす (terasu, to illuminate).  The use of に (ni) as the particle highlights the source of the illumination (the basis for the comparison), illustrating the metaphorical extension of the verb's original meaning.",
