    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「を」 (an object marker), the conjunctive form of the verb 「禁じる」 (kinjiru, 'to prohibit'), and 「得ない」 (enai, 'cannot obtain/achieve'). Literally, it suggests a state where one 'cannot prohibit' or 'cannot stop' a certain feeling or action, thus conveying the sense of being unable to hold back.",
    "writeup": "「を禁じ得ない」 is a formal grammar pattern used to express that one “cannot help feeling (A)” or “cannot hold back from (A).” It is primarily used with words that express emotions or things that result from emotions, such as tears or laughter. This construction combines the object marker 「を」, the conjunctive form of the verb 「禁じる」 ('to prohibit'), and the 「得ない」 pattern which means 'to not gain' but is used similarly to 「できない」. 「を禁じ得ない」 follows nouns, or occasionally verbs that have been nominalized with 「の」.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nThis grammar pattern is almost exclusively used to express one's own, first-person opinion. Due to this, it may sound unnatural if used to express others' feelings.",
