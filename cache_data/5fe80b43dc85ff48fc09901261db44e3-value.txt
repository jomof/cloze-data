    "etymology": "The expression combines 「何 (nan)」, meaning 'what' or 'how many,' with a counter word and the particle 「か (ka)」, which often indicates a question or uncertainty. Therefore, the literal sense is akin to 'how many… I wonder?' This expresses the speaker's vagueness about the exact quantity.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「なん+counter+か」 in Japanese is a way to express an uncertain number of something, similar to saying \"some,\" \"several,\" or \"a few\" in English. Literally, the meaning is closer to \"what + counter + I wonder?\" indicating the speaker's uncertainty about the number.\n\nIn addition to 「なん」, 「いく」, from the kanji 「幾」 (how many/much) can also be used in similar expressions. While both are fairly common, 「幾」 is more often found in set expressions like 「幾ら (ikura) - how much」 and 「幾つ (ikutsu) - how many/old」, whereas 「なん」 is more frequently used for counting specific things, like people.\n\nBoth 「何」 and 「幾」 are regularly seen in plain hiragana and kanji, so it's worth remembering both.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nDespite having the same kanji, 「なん」 is almost always used to count things, while 「なに」 is used to identify things.",
