    "etymology": "This grammar point is a double negative construction. 「ない」 means \"not\", and the conjunctive form 「なく」 connects it to another 「は」 and 「ない」 to create a nuanced expression. The 「は」 particle here emphasizes the preceding word 「なく」, further softening the negation.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なくはない」 is used to express that something is 'slightly (A)', 'somewhat (A)', or 'in some respects (A)'. It's a double negative, essentially meaning \"it's not that it isn't (A).\" \n\n*   It's formed by connecting the 「なく」 (conjunctive) form of 「ない」 to a verb or adjective, followed by 「は」 and then 「ない」. Think of it as a softened way of agreeing or admitting something with reservations.\n*   While it's mostly used with verbs, it can follow nouns, often with 「が」, 「は」, or 「に」 in between.\n*   「は」 can be replaced with 「も」 for a slightly stronger nuance. \n*   This grammar is often used with the potential form of verbs to show that something is not impossible, despite appearances.",
