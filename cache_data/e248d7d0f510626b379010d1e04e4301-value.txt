  "writeup": "にほかならない is a grammatical pattern used to emphasize that something is definitively (A), or nothing but (A).  Other common translations include 'none other than (A)' or 'simply (A)'. This expression is frequently used to highlight statements, reasons, or causes.  It's particularly useful when you want to leave no room for doubt or alternative explanations.  The formal nature of にほかならない makes it unsuitable for casual conversation.  Think of it as the sophisticated cousin of simpler phrases that convey similar meanings. It is often used to explain or express the result or the cause in a clear and decisive manner.  Importantly, it usually requires careful thought in its use in casual speech and writing. ",
  "etymology": "にほかならない combines the noun 他 (ta) meaning 'other' and the negative form of the verb なる (naru) meaning 'to become'.  Literally, it means '(A) cannot become anything other than what it is,' reinforcing the definitive nature of the statement.",

Context is crucial.  The choice of phrase depends entirely on whether you want to highlight the definitive nature of a thing or an inevitability of the situation."
