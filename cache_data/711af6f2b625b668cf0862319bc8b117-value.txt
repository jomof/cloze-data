    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ても」 is a combination of the 「て」-form of a verb or adjective and the particle 「も」. The 「て」-form connects clauses, often indicating a reason or cause, while 「も」 adds the nuance of \"even if\" or \"even though,\" creating a concessive conditional.",
    "writeup": "「ても」 expresses the idea of \"even if\" or \"even though\" something is the case, the result is still unexpected or unchanged. It connects two clauses, showing a contrast between the condition and the outcome. For verbs and い-adjectives, use the て-form and add 「も」. For nouns and な-adjectives, use 「でも」. It emphasizes that despite a certain condition, the main clause remains true. This grammar point is commonly used in everyday conversation to express resilience, acceptance, or unexpected results.",
