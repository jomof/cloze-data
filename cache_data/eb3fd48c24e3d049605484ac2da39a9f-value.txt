        "writeup": "The negative form of う-Verbs are conjugated based on the same set of rules used for other forms of う-Verb conjugation (changing the last kana, followed by the addition of something else). In the case of negation, the additional component will be ない (casual), or ません (polite).\n\nAs can be seen here, the kana change differs depending on whether ない or ません is being used. If ない will be used, the last kana will always change from the kana ending with a う sound, to the kana ending with an あ sound within the same row. If ません will be used, the change will be from the う sound kana to the い sound kana.\n\nThe only exception to this rule are verbs that end in the kana う. Instead of changing to あ (the あ sound kana in the same row), う will become わ, when used with ない.\n\nWhile the common translation of ない and ません is simply \"not\", they actually have several possible nuances. These nuances are \"don't\" (usually not), \"won't\" (intentionally not), or \"can't\" (unintentionally not).\n\nBoth ない and ません are auxiliary verbs (ません is a conjugation of ます), meaning that they have their own set of conjugation rules.\n\n**Caution:** The ない attached to make the negative form of adjectives is a different word, and therefore follows different conjugation rules. The ない attached to adjectives is an い-Adjective itself, and not an auxiliary verb.",

    "etymology": "The negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 is believed to originate from 「無(な)い」, meaning 'nothing' or 'non-existent.' Over time, it grammaticalized to become the primary negative marker for verbs and i-adjectives. The polite form 「ません」 is derived from 「ます」, a verb ending indicating politeness, combined with 「ない」 to negate it.",
    "writeup": "The negative form of う-verbs indicates that an action will not, does not, or cannot occur. It's a fundamental aspect of Japanese grammar.\n\nThere are two main forms: casual (ない) and polite (ません). To conjugate, you'll change the final う sound to either あ (for ない) or い (for ません), with one crucial exception: verbs ending in う change to わ when using ない.\n\nFor example:\n*   話す (hanasu - to speak) becomes 話さない (hanasanai - does not speak) in the casual negative form.\n*   話す becomes 話しません (hanashimasen - does not speak) in the polite negative form.\n*   買う (kau - to buy) becomes 買わない (kawanai - does not buy).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The nuances of ない and ません extend beyond a simple \"not.\" They can imply \"don't,\" \"won't,\" or even \"can't,\" depending on the context.\n*   Be cautious when encountering ない attached to adjectives. It follows different conjugation rules as it functions as an い-adjective itself.",
