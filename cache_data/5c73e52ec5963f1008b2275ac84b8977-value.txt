  "writeup": "たった(no) is a common adverb in Japanese that emphasizes a small quantity or short duration.  It originates from an intensified form of ただ \"only,\" \"merely.\"  Unlike ただ, たった implies a surprisingly small amount relative to expectations.  It often precedes the number or noun it modifies, often with の following it.  For instance, たった３人 \"only three people\" suggests the speaker expected more.  This adverb frequently appears at sentence beginnings, modifying the entire sentence.  It often works in conjunction with other similar expressions such as だけ and しか.  A fun fact: ただいま \"I'm home\" occasionally appears as たったいま, emphasizing the immediacy of the arrival.",
  "etymology": "The adverb たった derives from the adverb ただ (tada), meaning 'only' or 'just'.  The addition of the 'っ' sound intensifies the meaning, emphasizing the small quantity or short duration.",
