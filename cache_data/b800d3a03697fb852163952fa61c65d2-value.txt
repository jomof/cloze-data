        "Register": "Formal; often used in writing",

    "etymology": "The particle 「のみ」 originates from the verb 「飲む(のむ)」, meaning \"to drink\" or \"to swallow\". Over time, it evolved to carry the nuance of \"taking in\" or \"accepting\" only a specific thing, thus leading to its current meaning of \"only\" or \"just\".",
    "writeup": "The particle 「のみ」 indicates that something is limited to a single item, action, or state. It is similar to 「だけ」 but is generally considered more formal and is often found in written language. It emphasizes that **nothing else** is included or possible. It directly follows a noun or, when used with a verb, the verb's dictionary form followed by 「だ」. When you want to say that you just do one thing, you say '[verb dictionary form] のみだ'. For example, 「食べるのみ」means 'I'm just going to eat.'",
