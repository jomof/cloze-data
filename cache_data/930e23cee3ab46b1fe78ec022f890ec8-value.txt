    "etymology": "The word 「但し」 originally comes from the verb 「只す(ただす)」, meaning \"to correct\" or \"to rectify.\" Over time, it evolved to mean \"however\" or \"provided that,\" indicating a correction or condition to the preceding statement. The kanji 「但」 itself means \"but\" or \"however.\"",
    "writeup": "「但し」 (tadashi) is a conjunction used to introduce a condition, restriction, or exception to a preceding statement. It's similar to saying \"however\" or \"provided that\" in English. It is considered a **formal** expression and is often found in written documents, legal texts, and academic papers.  It's used to add a qualification or limitation to what has already been said.  It is generally not used in casual conversation. 「但し」 often appears at the beginning of a sentence, following the statement it qualifies.",
