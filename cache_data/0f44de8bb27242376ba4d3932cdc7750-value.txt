    "writeup": "ましょう is the polite volitional form, derived from the auxiliary verb ます. It's a common and polite way to suggest doing something together or express one's own intention. It's often translated as \"Let's...\" or \"Shall we...?\"  To form it, attach ましょう to the ます-stem of a verb (the part before ます). While it can mean \"Shall we?\" it also expresses a declaration that something will or needs to be done. This use reflects its volitional meaning: deliberately doing something. Think of it as a polite \"I shall\" in English.",
