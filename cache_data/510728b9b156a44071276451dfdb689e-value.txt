  "writeup": "を契機に is a formal grammatical construction used to express a significant event or turning point that serves as a catalyst for subsequent change.  It literally translates to \"using something as a turning point,\" but more naturally renders as \"as a result of,\" \"due to,\" or \"taking (something) as an opportunity.\"  The structure is always:  **[Noun/Nominalized Verb Phrase] を契機に [Resulting Action/State].**  Note the formality; this structure is not suitable for casual conversation.  The event expressed before を契機に is typically a major life event, or significant historical occurrence.  While similar to をきっかけに, which implies a less profound trigger, を契機に emphasizes a critical juncture or turning point.  This subtle difference is crucial for natural usage.  Incorrect usage might sound unnatural or stiff. Consider the gravity of the event you're describing before employing this construction.",
  "etymology": "契機 (kikkai) itself combines 契 (chi, contract, bond) and 機 (ki, opportunity, occasion). This suggests an event forming a kind of pivotal contract or agreement leading to subsequent action, reflecting its connotation as a critical juncture or turning point.  The particle に expresses the instrumentality of this contract or agreement. The overall construction emphasizes the transformative power of the event and reflects the careful thought involved in utilizing this weighty expression in Japanese.",
