    "etymology": "「たった」 is derived from 「ただ」, meaning \"only\" or \"merely,\" with added emphasis. It highlights a sense of unexpectedly small quantity or a minimal extent.",
    "writeup": "「たった」 is a common adverb that emphasizes the limited quantity or extent of something. It originates from an intensified form of 「唯 (ただ)」, meaning \"only\" or \"merely\". 「たった」 conveys that something is \"only (A)\", \"just (A)\", or \"no more than (A)\". This nuance is typically used when the actual amount of (A) is surprisingly low compared to what the speaker anticipated.\n\n「たった」 often appears at the beginning of sentences, either modifying the entire sentence or modifying a specific number when followed by 「の」. Because 「たった」 is an adverb used for emphasis, it frequently accompanies similar grammar patterns like 「だけ」 and 「しか」.",
