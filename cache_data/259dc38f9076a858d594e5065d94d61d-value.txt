  "writeup": "The grammar point \"ところだった ①\" describes a situation where an action was about to happen but did not.  It emphasizes the near-miss aspect.  The construction uses the noun ところ (\"place, point in time\") combined with the past tense copula だった.  Think of it as expressing that the speaker narrowly avoided a certain outcome. The verb associated with ところ is always in its dictionary form, illustrating the action's imminent nature before it was interrupted or prevented.  This nuance is essential for correctly understanding and employing this grammatical structure.  It's a versatile tool applicable across various registers, and understanding its subtle implications elevates the naturalness of your Japanese communication.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of \"ところだった\" lies in the combination of two elements: ところ (tokoro), meaning \"place\" or \"point in time,\" and だった (datta), the past tense form of the copula だ (da).  The combination suggests that an event was \"at the point\" of happening in the past, but it ultimately did not occur. The use of the past tense highlights the missed opportunity or averted situation.",

    {
      "japanese": "危うく階段から**ころびるところだった**。",
      "english": "I almost fell down the stairs.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a common casual register suitable for everyday conversation. The phrasing \"ころびるところだった\" (korobi-tokoro datta) naturally conveys a sense of relief or near-miss experience.  The use of the plain past tense だった (datta) also reflects the informal nature of the speech."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "大事なプレゼンテーションを忘れてしまう**ところだった**んです。",
      "english": "I almost forgot my important presentation.",
      "register": "teineigo",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Adding \"んです\"(n desu) makes the sentence polite, suitable for an apologetic setting, especially when speaking to a superior or someone you want to show respect to. The polite nature softens the potential blame associated with forgetting a presentation.  The sentence structure and polite ending \"んです\" are used widely across gender and age groups."

    {
      "japanese": "もう少しで事故に**遭うところだった**。",
      "english": "I almost got into an accident.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence is simple and direct, suitable for casual conversation but also effectively conveys the seriousness of the near-accident. The word choice and lack of embellishments keep the description succinct and impactful. It's commonly used across genders and age groups in informal settings, but the severity could be adjusted to fit the formality of different social situations."

    {
      "japanese": "あなたに会える**ところだった**のに、残念です。",
      "english": "I was just about to meet you, what a shame.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "melancholic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This expresses a missed opportunity to meet someone.  The phrase 「あなたに会えるところだった」(anata ni aeru tokoro datta) is quite versatile in terms of gender and age, although the addition of \"残念です\" (zannen desu) adds a slightly more formal tone.  The formality of the sentence hinges on the context. For example, it could be slightly altered to become less melancholic and more appropriate for an intimate setting."

    {
      "japanese": "君に告白する**ところだった**んだが、君が先に彼氏がいるって言ってきて、全部台無しだよ。",
      "english": "I was about to confess my feelings to you, but then you said you already have a boyfriend, and that ruined everything.",

      "setting": "melancholic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses very intimate language.  The 「君に告白するところだった」(kimi ni kokuhaku suru tokoro datta) phrasing is typical of intimate relationships between a male and female, showing a degree of closeness and casualness.  The use of 「君」(kimi) is a very intimate way to address someone, typically reserved for close friends or romantic partners. The sentence is specifically suited for a male speaker and a female listener."

    {
      "japanese": "あなたとキスする**ところだった**のよ…",
      "english": "I was about to kiss you...",
      "register": "shitashii kuchō",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "This flirty sentence uses the 「ところだった」(tokoro datta) construction to hint at a missed opportunity for a kiss.  The 「のよ」(no yo) ending is a feminine, slightly teasing particle, suggesting that the speaker is playfully hinting at the near-miss, but still flirtatious.  The use of 「あなた」(anata) rather than 「君」(kimi) adds a layer of politeness, even within a flirtatious context."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the key to using ところだった effectively lies in understanding the context.  It's not simply about the action; it's about the interrupted or averted action, the 'almost' that didn't quite happen. The choice of verb and the overall sentence structure work together to create the specific nuance of a near-miss. Pay attention to how the context affects the tone and register.",

      "term": "ところだった ②",
      "meaning": "Was just about to do something, Was in the middle of...",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike ところだった ① which emphasizes the near-miss or averted action, ところだった ② focuses on the action's immediacy without necessarily implying an interruption."

    {
      "term": "ところだ",
      "meaning": "About to, On the verge of",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While both express an imminent action, ところだ is in the non-past tense and doesn't convey the same sense of a missed opportunity as ところだった ①."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, focus on the tense and the implied outcome.  ところだった ① always uses the past tense だった and implies an action that didn't happen. ところだ uses the non-past tense and simply indicates that an action is about to happen.  Understanding this difference will ensure accurate and nuanced communication."
