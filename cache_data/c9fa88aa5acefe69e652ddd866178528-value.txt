  "writeup": "あわよくば combines the archaic い-adjective あわよい ('convenient,' 'timely') with the conditional particle ば ('if').  It translates as 'if luck is on my side,' 'if the time is right,' 'if possible,' or 'all going well.' While rooted in older Japanese, あわよくば functions as a single, adverbial unit in modern usage. It precedes the phrase describing the hoped-for outcome.  The attachment of ば to the く-form of あわよい, rather than the expected けれ-form in modern conjugation, reflects the distinct ば-conjugation rules for い-adjectives in classical Japanese.",
  "etymology": "あわよくば is a fascinating example of how archaic grammatical structures can persist in modern Japanese, albeit in a somewhat fossilized form. The い-adjective あわよい, meaning 'convenient' or 'opportune,' is no longer used in its original form. However, its usage in あわよくば showcases a grammatical construction that reflects older patterns of verb and adjective conjugation. The ば is used similarly as in other conditional expressions, adding a layer of hope or contingency to the sentence.",
