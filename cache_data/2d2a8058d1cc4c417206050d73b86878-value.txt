    "etymology": "The grammar point 「や否や」 comes from combining 「や」, a particle emphasizing the preceding word (in this case, the action), and 「否や」, meaning 'no' or 'not'. Literally, it suggests something happens before one can even deny or negate the preceding action.",
    "writeup": "「や否や」 is a formal expression indicating that something happens immediately after something else. Think of it as \"as soon as\" or \"no sooner than.\" It's used after verbs in their dictionary form. The event described after 「や否や」 often happens spontaneously or is surprising. This grammar point is mainly used in formal writing or speech. Note that the 「否や」 part can sometimes be omitted without changing the meaning.",
