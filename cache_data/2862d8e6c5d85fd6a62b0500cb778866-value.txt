    "etymology": "The non-past form, also known as the dictionary form 「辞書形 (じしょけい)」, is the base form of the verb. It's the form you'll find in dictionaries. It serves as the foundation for many other conjugations and grammatical structures.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, the non-past form of verbs is the same as the dictionary form. Unlike English, this form covers several cases where English would require different conjugations. These include verbs ending with '-s' (sees, hears, goes), verbs requiring 'will' (will see, will hear, will go), and verbs that don't require conjugation (see, hear, go).\n\nBecause the non-past form covers several nuances, it's important to use expressions of time to clarify the meaning. Without a time word, the nuance becomes a general fact that is true at any time.\n\nThe non-past form can express general facts, habits, or future events.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   In books, the non-past form may be used for events happening 'in the moment,' but the context will usually make this clear.",
