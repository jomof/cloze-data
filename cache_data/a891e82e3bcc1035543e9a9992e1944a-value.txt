    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 in this context doesn't have a direct, traceable etymology in the same way as some other grammatical elements. Instead, it functions as a sentence-ending particle that adds a layer of emotion or emphasis, similar to 「な」 or 「ね」. Its usage here likely evolved from a combination of its basic directional meaning (toward a feeling) and its intensifying function.",
    "writeup": "The 「に」 particle, when used at the end of a sentence with 「だろう」 or 「でしょう」, conveys a sense of regret, disappointment, or 'if only'. It's used to express that things didn't turn out as desired, or to express a wish for a different outcome. This grammar point is often used when reflecting on past events or contemplating hypothetical situations. For example, saying 「もっと勉強すればよかったのに」 means 'If only I had studied more'. The level of regret can vary, but it always implies a degree of dissatisfaction with the current state or past events. The addition of 「だろう」 or 「でしょう」 softens the tone and adds a layer of speculation or conjecture to the regret. While commonly used in informal speech, it can appear in more formal contexts when expressing a nuanced sense of regret.",
