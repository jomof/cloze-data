  "writeup": "The verb たがる (tagaru) indicates a third-person desire or inclination to do something.  It's formed by taking the 'masu-stem' of a verb, replacing the final -i with -tagaru.  For example, the verb 食べる (taberu, to eat) becomes 食べたがる (tabetagaru, to want to eat).  This expresses the *behavior* of wanting to do something, not merely the *desire* itself.  Important Considerations:  たがる is different from たい (tai, want to), which expresses a first-person desire.  It also contrasts with てほしい (te hoshii, want someone to do), which expresses a desire for someone else's action.  Mastering these subtle distinctions is key.  Finally, note the frequent use of たがる with children's behavior, suggesting a persistent, almost stubborn want.",
  "etymology": "たがる is derived from the combination of the volitional form たい (tai) and the verb がる (garu), which denotes an inclination or tendency. The い (i) of たい changes to あ (a) to seamlessly combine with がる. This combination creates a nuanced meaning that implies a repetitive or insistent desire, often associated with the actions of children or those behaving childishly.",
