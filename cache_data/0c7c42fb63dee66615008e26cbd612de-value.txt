  "writeup": "The sentence-ending particle ことだ carries a nuance of obligation or strong suggestion.  It's often used to express what someone *should* do, or what is expected of them.  Think of it as a slightly stronger version of \"should\" in English, carrying a bit more weight than a simple recommendation.  It's frequently found in rules, instructions, and advice given with a degree of authority, such as signs in public places or commands from superiors.  While grammatically versatile, its usage often leans towards a more formal or instructive register, and its implication of authority limits its appropriate use in informal settings.  The \"こと\" part is derived from the noun こと meaning 'thing, matter' so the construction is fundamentally an imperative in nature.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "毎日運動することだ。",
      "english": "You should exercise every day.",
      "register": "Standard",
      "setting": "Instructive",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence is a straightforward piece of advice, suitable for various contexts. The plain form of ことだ is used, suggesting an objective, non-emotive tone."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "もっと自信を持つことだ。",
      "english": "You should have more confidence.",
      "register": "Semi-formal",
      "setting": "Supportive",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This example presents advice with a supportive tone, suitable for a friend or acquaintance.  Again, the plain form implies objectivity, though the encouragement undercuts any overly authoritative feel."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "約束の時間を守ることだ。",
      "english": "You should keep your appointments.",
      "register": "Standard",
      "setting": "Instructive",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This exemplifies the instructive use of ことだ in a neutral context, perhaps a reminder to oneself or another."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の気持ちに気づくことだ。",
      "english": "You should be mindful of his feelings.",
      "register": "Semi-formal",
      "setting": "Advisory",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses ことだ in an advisory role. While not explicitly formal, it shows concern, guiding the listener without being overtly controlling."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "もっと私のことを考えてくれることだ！",
      "english": "You should think about me more!",
      "register": "Casual",
      "setting": "Flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The exclamation mark and the use of 「もっと私のことを考えてくれる」 shows a more demanding tone, but also carries a flirty implication—a playful demand for attention.  The casual register suits the intimate setting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "今度、一緒に映画を見に行こうよ。…そう、することだ！",
      "english": "Let's go see a movie together sometime. ...Yeah, we should!",

      "setting": "First-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "Here, ことだ is used to express the speaker's enthusiasm for the suggestion and to reinforce the suggestion indirectly.  The 「よ」 particle adds a friendly tone that suits the first-date setting. The speaker's use of 「そう、することだ！」 is a more natural way to show enthusiasm than the alternative sentence ending with simply ことだ."

    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the appropriate usage of ことだ hinges on the context. In informal conversations, softer suggestions are generally preferred.  It's best to use ことだ for instructions, expectations, or advice where a sense of authority or obligation is intended.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "Choosing between these similar expressions depends on the degree of obligation and the context.  If you need to express a strong expectation or instruction, ことだ is a good choice, but for softer suggestions or preferences, use the alternatives accordingly. The key is considering the strength of the obligation and the level of formality required."
