    "etymology": "There are several theories about the origin of 折角 (せっかく). One common explanation is that it's an abbreviation of 頭巾の角を折る (ずきん の つの を おる), meaning \"to fold the corner of a hood.\" This refers to a Confucian scholar who would intentionally fold his hood to keep it from getting wet. People began imitating him, and 折角 came to mean 'intentionally' or 'to go out of one's way'.",
    "writeup": "**折角 (せっかく)** is an idiomatic adverb expressing that something was done \"with trouble,\" \"at great pains,\" or that it marks \"a rare or long-awaited occasion.\" As an adverb modifying the sentence, it often appears at the beginning. When emphasizing an event as long-awaited, it appears directly before the event, followed by の.",
