  "writeup": "The grammar point てみる combines the te-form of a verb with the verb みる (miru, \"to see\") to express the act of trying something.  It's not simply \"to try,\" but carries the nuance of \"trying something to see the result.\" This often implies a first-time attempt or an experiment.  The polite form is てみます (temimasu).  Past tense forms, such as てみた (temita) and てみました (temimashita),  generally suggest a completed attempt.  However, unlike English, a successful outcome is implied unless otherwise stated.  This construction can also be used as a suggestion for someone else to try something, using forms like  (A) + てみて (te mite) or (A) + てみてください (te mite kudasai). In informal settings, you might even hear  (A) + てみ (temi), implying 'Just give it a go!'\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n* Using the kanji for 見る (miru) emphasizes the \"seeing\" aspect, potentially shifting the focus from simply trying to actively observing the outcome.\n* The success or failure of the attempt is often implicit, depending on context.",
  "etymology": "The てみる construction cleverly uses the verb みる (miru), originally meaning \"to see,\" to add the layer of observation to the action.  This reflects the Japanese emphasis on experiencing and observing the consequences of one's actions.",
