    "katakana": "キライガアル",

  "etymology": "嫌い (kirai) means 'dislike' or 'aversion'.  The particle が marks the subject of the verb ある (aru), which means 'to exist' or 'to be'.  The combination implies an inherent, undesirable tendency or habit.  The construction subtly suggests a persistent, slightly negative characteristic rather than a strong, outright dislike.",
  "writeup": "The Japanese grammar point \"きらいがある (kirai ga aru)\" describes a negative tendency or habitual behavior.  It literally translates to \"there is a dislike of (doing something)\" but functions more idiomatically as \"to have a tendency to\" or \"to be prone to.\"  It's often used to express a slight inclination toward an undesirable action, habit, or characteristic.  This nuanced meaning makes it distinct from simpler expressions of tendency.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This structure typically follows the dictionary form of verbs, verbs negated with ない (nai), or nouns ending in の (no).\n*   Because きらいがある is inherently somewhat strong, it's often softened with adverbs like 少し (sukoshi, 'a little bit') or どうも (doumo, 'somehow').\n*   This expression generally avoids describing the speaker's own undesirable tendencies, as it focuses on a perceived negativity from the speaker's perspective.",

The statement 「あなたといると、時間を忘れてしまうきらいがあるわ。」(anata to iru to, jikan o wasurete shimau kirai ga aru wa) is softer and more romantic than a direct confession, making it suitable for a flirty intimate exchange."
