    "etymology": "がてら is derived from がてり, which is an abbreviation of the conjunctive form (連用形) of 糅つ (かてつ), meaning \"to mix together,\" and あり (ari, \"to exist\"). So かてあり (kateari) was abbreviated to かてり (kateri), which then underwent sound changes to がてり (gateri) and がてら (gatera). This origin subtly implies the mixing or combining of two actions.",
    "writeup": "「がてら」 is used to express doing something else while performing a certain action or on a certain occasion. It's similar to 「ながら」 in that it indicates doing two things at the same time, but 「がてら」 emphasizes that the first action (A) is a good opportunity to do the second action (B). When used with nouns, 「がてら」 typically connects to nouns that signify physical movement. 「がてら」 is considered a more formal expression.",
