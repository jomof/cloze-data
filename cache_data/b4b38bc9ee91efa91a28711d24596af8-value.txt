  "writeup": "んがため is a grammatical pattern used to express the purpose or goal of an action.  It conveys a strong sense of intention or determination.  The 'ん' is a contraction of the classical auxiliary verb む, which signifies intent or strong will, similar to う and よう in modern Japanese.  This 'ん' is followed by が, then the noun ため, meaning 'sake' or 'purpose'.  The 'ん' connects to the negative stem (ない stem) of verbs.  の or に usually follows んがため, depending on whether it's directly followed by a noun or a verb phrase. The inherent meaning of む, expressing strong intention, is preserved in んがため.  This structure implies the speaker's firm resolve to achieve the stated goal. Because む expresses intent, the verb to which ん attaches must represent an action under the speaker's control.  Important Consideration: Unlike most modern structures, when used with する, the archaic form せ is employed instead of し.",
