  "writeup": "The particle combination \"ても\" (te mo) conveys the meaning 'even if' or 'even though'.  It's formed by attaching the adverbial particle も (mo) to the て-form of a verb or い-adjective.  For な-adjectives and nouns, use \"でも\" (de mo) instead.  This construction is versatile and can emphasize a negative context, translating to 'even if not' or 'even though not'.  While often explained as a combination of て and も,  でも is frequently treated as a single unit, especially in casual speech.  This shows the beautiful fluidity of Japanese grammar; sometimes, what appears as two separate words acts as a single grammatical unit! Consider the nuance carefully—it implies a concession or an acknowledgement of a contrasting situation.",
  "etymology": "The て (te) form originates from the 連用形 (ren'yōkei) — the continuative form — of verbs.  It shows continuity of action or state. Adding も (mo), the emphatic adverbial particle, implies that something is true regardless of a specific condition.  The combination creates a concessive nuance. The usage with な-adjectives and nouns is slightly different, stemming from the use of で (de) as a case marker, highlighting a condition or state.",
