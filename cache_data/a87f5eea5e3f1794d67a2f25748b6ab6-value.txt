  "writeup": "The Japanese word あそこ, pronounced \"asoko,\" refers to a location distant from both the speaker and the listener.  It's a demonstrative pronoun, similar to \"that place over there\" in English.  It's frequently used in casual conversation and is considered standard Japanese.  While generally straightforward, it's crucial to distinguish あそこ from other similar words like あっち ('that way over there'), which emphasizes direction, whereas あそこ focuses solely on the location itself.  Understanding this nuance is key to using あそこ correctly and naturally.",
  "etymology": "あそこ is a compound word formed from あ (a particle indicating something somewhat distant) and そこ (there, that place).  The combination creates the meaning of 'that place over there'.",
