  "writeup": "じゃない is the casual, contracted form of ではない.  It's crucial to understand the contraction of では to じゃ; it's a fundamental aspect of natural Japanese speech.  じゃない (casual) and ではない (semi-formal) are used to create the negative form of nouns and な-adjectives.  Simply attach them to the base form of the noun or な-adjective.  じゃ and では can also be used with the negative ます-form of ある to create a polite negative.  While ない is sometimes informally shortened to ね or ねえ, this is considered quite casual and even a bit blunt, best avoided in most situations.  Important Consideration:  じゃない is very frequently used in questions, similar to じゃないか (a different lesson).  The key nuance is that じゃない as a question is more direct, like 'isn't it?' in English, whereas じゃないか is more like 'don't you think?'. The rising intonation when asking a question with じゃない will usually make the intent clear.",
  "etymology": "じゃない comes from the contraction of では (dewa) ない (nai). では is a contraction of で + は, where で is the particle marking a topic and は is the topic marker particle.  ない is the negative form of the verb ある (to be).",
