    "writeup": "**ここ** is one of the forms of the **これ** family of words used to identify things close to the speaker. In this case, it denotes a place. Just as **これ** means \"this,\" **ここ** means \"this place\" or simply \"here.\"\n\n**Fun Fact:** The complete set of words used for identification/demonstration in Japanese is known as **こそあど言葉** (KO, SO, A, DO words). These include all the variations of **これ**, **それ**, **あれ**, and **どれ**.\n\n**Caution:** Don't confuse **ここ** with **こっち**. While both can be translated as \"here,\" **こっち** emphasizes the direction one is moving or facing, whereas **ここ** strictly refers to \"this (stationary) place.\"",
