    "etymology": "The grammar point combines 「もの」, which adds emphasis or explanation, with 「だから」, meaning \"therefore\" or \"because.\" Together, they create a stronger sense of providing a reason or excuse.",
    "writeup": "「ものだから」 is a strong phrase used to explain or excuse something. Think of it as an extension of 「から」 (because), where 「もの」 emphasizes the preceding statement. Common translations include \"because (A)\" and \"the reason is (A).\" It follows verbs and い-adjectives directly, while な-adjectives and nouns require 「な」 before 「ものだから」.\n\n「ものだから」 can be shortened to 「もので」 or 「もんで」 without changing the meaning. The 「で」 indicates continuation, even if what follows is omitted if it's obvious.\n\nOften, 「ものだから」 explains actions, emphasizing how situation (A) led the speaker to do (B).",
