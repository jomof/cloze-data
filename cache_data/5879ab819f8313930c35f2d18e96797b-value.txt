  "writeup": "The grammar point のも当然だ expresses the natural or obvious consequence of a preceding statement.  It translates to \"It is only natural that...\" or \"It is no wonder that...\".  This construction typically follows verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns modified by な.  The particle の marks the preceding clause as the subject.  The も adds emphasis, suggesting that the consequence is not only natural but also expected and perhaps even somewhat predictable.  Think of it as a stronger, more emphatic version of て当然だ, emphasizing the inevitability of the outcome.  The difference is subtle but important.  It's like the difference between simply stating something is natural and explicitly highlighting that a specific outcome was the natural result of preceding events.",
  "etymology": "The structure is built upon the established particle の, indicating the subject, and the natural-consequence phrase 当然だ (tōzen da, 'it is only natural'). The も adds emphasis, making the natural consequence more forceful than just using は.  This layered structure reflects the precise nature of Japanese expression.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "会社のお金を勝手に使ったなら、クビになるのは当然だ。",
      "english": "If you used company money without permission, it's only natural that you'd be fired.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a conditional structure, 「使ったなら」, setting the stage for the inevitable consequence.  The bluntness of 「クビになる」 (to be fired) reflects a serious tone. The overall tone is firm, fitting for a professional context. "

    {
      "japanese": "このタワーマンションは六本木にあるので、家賃が高いのは当然です。",
      "english": "This tower condo is in Roppongi, so it's only natural that the rent is high.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite form 「〜です」 conveys respect and formality, suitable for providing factual information, here about rent costs.  The use of 「ので」 further emphasizes the causal relationship between location and price."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "おばあちゃんは毎朝１０キロも散歩しているから、元気なのも当然だ。",
      "english": "Grandma walks 10 kilometers every morning, so it's no wonder she's so healthy.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual 「〜から」 shows closeness with the subject, and the statement is made as a simple observation.  The use of 「おばあちゃん」 (grandma) also suggests a familial context."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この1年間全然勉強をしてこなかったから、落第も当然だ。",
      "english": "I haven't studied at all this year, so it's no wonder I failed.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The speaker's self-deprecating tone in 「全然勉強をしてこなかった」 (haven't studied at all) and 「落第」 (failure) creates a sense of acceptance of the consequence. The casual register reflects self-reflection."

    {
      "japanese": "彼があんな風に振舞っていたなら、ほかの人からの受けが悪いのも当然だ。",
      "english": "If he behaved like that, it's only natural that he's unpopular.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「あんな風に」 (like that) to avoid directly criticizing the man. The conditional 「〜なら」 adds objectivity. The overall tone is neutral but implies criticism."

      "japanese": "久しぶりに彼に会ったのだから、彼女が嬉しそうなのは当然だ。",
      "english": "Seeing him after such a long time, it's only natural that she'd be happy.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The 「のだから」 showcases the causal relationship. The sentence is a straightforward statement, lacking any strong emotional coloring, suitable for friendly conversation."

      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "instructive",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「囁かれたら」 (if I am whispered to) and 「ドキッとする」 (to be flustered) creates a playful, slightly suggestive tone. The 「でしょう？」 (isn't it?) softens the statement into a question."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "こんなに素敵なあなたと一緒なら、楽しくないわけがないのも当然だ。",
      "english": "Being with someone as wonderful as you, it's only natural that it wouldn't be fun.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「こんなに素敵なあなた」 (such a wonderful you) is a blatant compliment.  The double negative 「楽しくないわけがない」 (there's no way it wouldn't be fun) intensifies the flirtatious nature, conveying confidence. The casual register suggests intimacy."
