  "writeup": "The grammar point \"につけ\" (ni tsuke) means \"whenever\" or \"every time something happens.\"  It's a rather elegant and somewhat archaic structure, more common in classical literature than contemporary conversation.  It implies a natural consequence or emotional response to the event described.  The structure connects an event (A) with a consequential thought or feeling (B). (B) is usually an involuntary reaction to (A).  While it can be used with nouns, it's more frequently seen with verbs. Note that the shorter form, につけ, is far more prevalent than the alternative, につけて.  Because of its formal and literary nature, using \"につけ\" in casual settings might sound unnatural or overly stiff.  Consider this grammar point a sophisticated addition to your literary Japanese arsenal, but not something you'd likely use frequently in everyday speech.",

      "japanese": "元カノが写っている写真を見る**につけ**、胸が痛くなる。",
      "english": "Whenever I see a picture with my ex-girlfriend, my heart aches.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses casual register, though the grammar point itself is formal, showing a contrast between the speaker's emotional state and their choice of words. The use of \"胸が痛くなる\" (mune ga itaku naru) is a common expression of heartache."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この防波堤で釣りをする**につけ**、父親のことを思い出す。",
      "english": "Every time I fish on this pier, I'm reminded of my father.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register makes the reminiscing feel personal and relatable. The phrase \"父親のことを思い出す\" (chichioya no koto o omoi dasu) is a simple, straightforward way of expressing remembrance, suited to casual conversation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼は何かに**つけ**文句を言うので、一緒にいるだけで疲れる。",
      "english": "He complains whenever anything happens, so just being around him is exhausting.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "complaining",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence utilizes casual language throughout, with the informal \"ので\" (node) connecting the cause and effect. The simplicity of \"文句を言う\" (monku o iu) reflects the casual nature of the complaint."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "妻は妊娠中なので、悲しい**につけ**嬉しい**につけ**、すぐに泣き出します。",
      "english": "Because my wife is pregnant, she starts to cry immediately, whether she's sad or happy.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of \"泣き出します\" (nakidashimasu) adds a touch of politeness, though the overall tone remains relatively informal.  The repeated use of \"につけ\" emphasizes the unpredictable nature of her emotional responses, highlighting the pregnancy."

    {
      "japanese": "あの時先輩に言われた事を思い出す**につけ**、怒りが込み上がってきます。",
      "english": "Whenever I remember what my senior said then, my anger wells up.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal register suits the situation of reflecting on a past event with a senior.  The phrase \"怒りが込み上がってきます\" (ikari ga komi agatte kimasu) is more polite and formal than a simpler expression of anger."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼と一緒に時間を過ごす**につけ**、なんでこんな人と付き合っているんだろうと思う。",
      "english": "Whenever I spend time with him, I wonder why I'm dating such a person.",

      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The intimate register reflects a close relationship and honest self-reflection. The use of  \"なんで\" (nande) is very informal and emphasizes a sense of frustration."

  "post_example_writeup": "While the examples demonstrate the usage of \"につけ\" in various contexts, remember its formal and literary nature.  Avoid using it in casual speech unless you are aiming for a specific stylistic effect or are speaking in a more formal or literary setting.",

      "term": "ごとに",

      "kind": "synonym",

      "meaning": "Repeated at intervals, Every other, Every, At intervals of",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that ごとに and おきに highlight the *frequency* of an event, while たびに emphasizes the action occurring *each time*. につけ, on the other hand, emphasizes the *emotional response* to the occurrence of an event.  Choose the most suitable particle based on whether you want to focus on the event's regularity, or the speaker's reaction to it."
