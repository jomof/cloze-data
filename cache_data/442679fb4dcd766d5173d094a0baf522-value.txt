    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「か」 has two primary functions: as a sentence-ending particle indicating a question and as an adverbial particle highlighting uncertainty. In this grammar point, 「か」 functions as an adverbial particle, similar to its use in words like 「どこか」 (somewhere) or 「誰か」 (someone). It marks the preceding question phrase as an uncertain element being inquired about within the main sentence.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「か」 serves to embed a question within a larger statement. It transforms a direct question into a clause that functions as a noun within the sentence. This is different from using 「か」 as a sentence-ending particle, which forms a direct question. When using 「か」 in this way, **avoid** placing 「だ」 or 「です」 immediately before it when following nouns or na-adjectives. The embedded question is often followed by verbs like 「知っている」 (to know), 「分かる」 (to understand), or 「決めました」 (decided).",
