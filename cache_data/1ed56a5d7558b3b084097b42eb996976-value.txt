  "writeup": "てください is a polite expression used to ask someone to do something.  It's most often translated as 'Please do (something)'.  ください is classified as honorific language (敬語 - keigo), a type of polite speech used to refer to the actions of others.  くださる (kudasaru) is the base form of this verb, and while ください is exclusively used for requests, くださる is the honorific equivalent of くれる (kureru). In informal settings, ください can be dropped, leaving just the て-form as a very casual 'Please do (something)'.  This is a crucial point to understand the nuance of politeness levels in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The polite form ください (kudasai) originates from the verb くださる (kudasaru), meaning 'to give' or 'to bestow' in an honorific context.  The て-form preceding ください indicates the action requested.  The combination elegantly expresses a polite request without being overly formal.",
