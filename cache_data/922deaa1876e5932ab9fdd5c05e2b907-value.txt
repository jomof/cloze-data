    "etymology": "The word 反面 (hanmen) literally means \"opposite side\" or \"reverse side.\" It originates from the idea of having two faces or aspects to a single object or situation, highlighting the contrast between them.",
    "writeup": "**反面 (hanmen)**, meaning \"opposite side\" or \"reverse side,\" is used to present two contrasting aspects of the same subject. It connects two phrases, typically highlighting a positive and a negative trait, or two opposing characteristics. It can be translated as \"while (A), (B),\" \"although (A), also (B),\" or \"on the other hand to (A), (B).\" As a noun, it follows verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (with な), or nouns (with である) to create a modified noun phrase. It's **important** to note that 反面 emphasizes contradiction, often contrasting a positive aspect with a negative one.",
