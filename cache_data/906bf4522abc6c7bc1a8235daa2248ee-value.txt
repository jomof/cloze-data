        "Usage": "Common in informal speech"
    },
    "etymology": "「つ」 is a slang abbreviation of 「という」. 「という」is formed from the quotation particle 「と」 and the verb 「言う」(iu, to say). Therefore, 「つ」 retains the quoting function of 「と」 while omitting the verb 「言う」.",
    "writeup": "「つ」 is a slang abbreviation of 「という」, meaning \"called (A),\" \"that (A) that was said,\" or \"known as (A).\" It's essentially a shortened way to quote something. You might also see it as 「っつ」 or 「つう」. 「という」 itself combines the quotation particle 「と」 and the verb 「言う」(iu, to say). \n\nBecause 「と」 is a quotation particle, 「つ」 can follow almost any word or statement. Though very slangy, it's quite common. Native speakers often shorten 「という」 in various ways, with 「つ」 being the shortest.\n\nThe slight pause in 「っつ」 can sometimes indicate the speaker is annoyed or losing patience, but that's not always the case. \n\nJust because 「言う」 disappears doesn't mean conjugation rules do. To indicate past tense (\"was said\") or progressive form (\"is being said\"), use forms like 「つった」 or 「つってん」. 「ている」 becoming 「てん」 is explained in more detail in the 「ん」 slang lesson.",
