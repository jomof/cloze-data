    "etymology": "This grammar point consists of the particle 「を」, the noun 「元(もと)」 meaning 'origin' or 'basis', and the particle 「に」. It literally translates to 'with (A) as the origin'.",
    "writeup": "When attached to a noun, 「をもとに」 indicates that something is \"based on (A),\" \"from (A),\" or \"according to (A).\" The literal meaning is similar to \"with (A) as the origin, (B),\" and is primarily used to reference a source from which something is created or started.\n\nMost of the time, 「をもとに」 will be written without kanji, but it is also possible to see it as 「を元に」.\n\nAs this grammar pattern is mainly used to highlight an origin of creation, it will often be seen in sentences that use verbs like 「書く」 (to write), 「できる」 (to be able), and 「作る」 (to make).\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「をもとに」 differs from 「に基づいて」 in that 「に基づいて」 indicates a foundation from which the judgement or conclusion of (B) is made, while 「をもとに」 focuses more on being a source of inspiration for (B), or enabling (B).",
