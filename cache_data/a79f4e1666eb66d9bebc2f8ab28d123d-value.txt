    "writeup": "This grammar point, Verb[て]・Adjective[て]+も〜ても, expresses the idea that no matter how much or how many times something is done, the result remains the same. It emphasizes the **futility** or relentlessness of a situation. The structure involves repeating the same verb or adjective in the て-form, followed by 'も'. For example, 飲んでも飲んでも (nondemo nondemo) means \"no matter how much I drink\". This pattern is used to convey frustration, persistence, or an unchanging state. Keep in mind that this pattern is generally used with the same verb repeated twice.",
