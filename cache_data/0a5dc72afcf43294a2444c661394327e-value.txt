    "etymology": "The kanji 「如」 itself means 'like' or 'as'. The forms 「如く」, 「如き」, and 「如し」 are derived from classical Japanese and retain a formal, literary flavor. 「如し」 is the base form, 「如く」 is adverbial, and 「如き」 is adjectival.",
    "writeup": "「如く」, 「如き」, and 「如し」 are literary expressions similar to 「よう」, indicating likeness or resemblance. However, they are much more formal and primarily found in writing. \n\n*   「如し」(gotoshi) is the base form, often appearing at the end of a sentence.\n*   「如く」(gotoku) is adverbial, modifying verbs or clauses.\n*   「如き」(gotoki) is adjectival, directly preceding nouns.\n\nLike 「よう」, these forms follow 「の」 after nouns. After verbs, they are linked via 「が」. Due to their formality, these expressions are rarely used in everyday conversation.",
