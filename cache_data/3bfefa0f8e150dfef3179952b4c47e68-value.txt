  "writeup": "The grammar point \"に難くない\" is a formal expression used to convey that something is 'not hard to' or 'easy to' do.  It uses the negative form of the *i*-adjective 難い (katai), meaning 'difficult', which is a less common variant of 難しい (muzukashii).  Crucially, this construction is restricted to verbs expressing mental processes like imagining, predicting, understanding, or inferring.  The particle に marks the object of these verbs. This is quite a specialized construction.  It's important to understand that while 難しい is frequently used, 難い is significantly less common in everyday conversation, appearing primarily in more formal settings.  The use of 難い instead of 難しい lends an air of formality to the entire expression.",
  "etymology": "The word 難い (katai) is an older, less frequently used variant of 難しい (muzukashii), both meaning 'difficult'.  The grammar point utilizes the negative form of this adjective,  creating the meaning of 'not difficult'.  The 'ni' particle indicates the object or topic to which the ease or difficulty applies.  The formality is inherent in the use of the less common adjective form, 難い. ",
