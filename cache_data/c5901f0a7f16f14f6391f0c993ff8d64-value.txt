  "details": {
    "Register": "Standard",

  "pronunciation": {
    "katakana": "デユウト",

  "etymology": "で言うと combines the particle で (de), indicating the means or manner, with 言うと (iu to), a conditional form of 言う (iu, to say).  The structure essentially means \"if one were to say... in terms of.\"  This highlights the comparative nature of the expression, drawing a parallel between two concepts.",
  "writeup": "The Japanese expression で言うと (de iu to), meaning \"in terms of\" or \"according to,\" is a versatile tool for drawing comparisons and clarifying perspectives. It's particularly useful for explaining how one thing relates to another, often by analogy.  Think of it as a way to contextualize something by referencing a familiar frame of reference.  The structure follows a noun, setting the context for the subsequent comparison.  It frequently appears in sentences alongside に当たる (ni ataru), meaning \"to correspond to\" or \"to be equivalent to.\"  This combination helps establish a clear equivalence or similarity between different concepts. For instance, explaining a complex technical concept using a simpler analogy readily employs で言うと.  While standard in register, its use is not restricted to any specific gender, age group, or region.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "この自転車は、車で言うとスポーツカーみたいなものだ。",
      "english": "This bike, if you were to compare it to cars, is like a sports car.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「みたいなものだ」 (mitaina mono da), which softens the direct comparison, making it sound more casual and less definitive.  This makes the statement suitable for a friendly or casual setting between peers."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の優しさは、太陽で言うと、温かい春の陽射しみたいだ。",
      "english": "His kindness, in terms of the sun, is like the warm spring sunshine.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「みたいだ」(mitai da) creates a playful and slightly poetic comparison, which is characteristic of a flirtatious tone, with the  speaker, a female, using gentle, romantic language to describe the male listener. 「春の陽射し」 (haruno hizashi) is a vivid and evocative image, adding to the romanticism."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この料理は、イタリア料理で言うとパスタにあたる。",
      "english": "This dish, if we're talking Italian food, is equivalent to pasta.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「にあたる」(ni ataru), which is a neutral and slightly more formal equivalent than simply 「みたいなものだ」.  The phrasing is suitable for a semi-formal conversation, such as a polite discussion about food."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "日本語で言うと、それは「ありがとう」に当たる表現です。",
      "english": "In Japanese, that expression corresponds to 'arigato'.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence employs the more formal expression 「に当たる」(ni ataru), making it appropriate for a formal setting. The use of です (desu) further emphasizes the polite and formal nature of the statement. "

    {
      "japanese": "彼の行動は、一言で言うと、無責任だ。",
      "english": "To put it simply, his actions are irresponsible.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The phrase 「一言で言うと」(ichigon de iu to) is used as a set expression for summarization. This makes the statement concise and to the point, suitable for expressing a serious opinion casually."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "君の笑顔は、春の桜で言うと、満開の桜のようです。",
      "english": "Your smile, if I compare it to cherry blossoms, is like a cherry blossom in full bloom.",
      "register": "shitashii kuchō",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The comparison to 「満開の桜」(mankai no sakura) implies beauty and a blossoming of something special, making this very intimate. The choice of 「ようです」(yō desu) which implies a feeling or an impression, rather than a factual statement, softens the statement. The male speaker is being gentle yet flirtatious."

    {
      "japanese": "この問題を、経済学で言うと、需給バランスの問題です。",
      "english": "In economics, this problem is a matter of supply and demand.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "academic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal register and academic setting are appropriate here due to the sentence's use of specific terminology, 「経済学」(keizaigaku) and 「需給バランス」(juukyuu baransu), and the use of です (desu)."

  "post_example_writeup": "Note that the nuance and appropriateness of で言うと can shift subtly depending on the context. Paying attention to the choice of comparative terms and the overall sentence structure is crucial for conveying the intended meaning accurately.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "から言うと",
      "meaning": "Speaking from the perspective of, From the viewpoint of",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike で言うと, which emphasizes a comparative analogy, から言うと (kara iu to) highlights the speaker's perspective or standpoint. It's less about drawing parallels and more about stating an opinion or observation based on a particular vantage point."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion between で言うと and から言うと, consider the focus of your statement.  で言うと focuses on drawing an analogy, highlighting similarities between concepts.  から言うと emphasizes the speaker's perspective as the lens through which the statement is made. Choosing between these depends on whether you're creating a comparison or presenting an opinion from a specific point of view."
