    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ならいざ知らず」 combines several elements. 「なら」 is the conditional form of the copula 「だ」, indicating a hypothetical situation. 「いざ」 is an adverb that signifies a point of departure or a shift in focus, akin to \"now\" or \"well then.\"  「知らず」 is the negative plain form of the verb 「知る」(shiru, to know). Literally, it translates to \"if it is [the case], well then I don't know.\"",
    "writeup": "「ならいざ知らず」 is a formal Japanese grammar expression used to present a contrast between two situations. It often conveys the nuance of \"I don't know about (A), but (B)...\" or \"Maybe (A), but (B).\"  The structure emphasizes that while the speaker might not be certain or concerned about the first scenario (A), the second scenario (B) is a more definitive or contrasting point. \n\nIt's constructed with 「なら」, the conditional form of the copula 「だ」 (da), followed by the adverb 「いざ」 (iza), meaning \"now\" or \"well then,\" and the negative plain form of the verb 「知る」 (shiru), which is 「知らず」 (shirazu), meaning \"not knowing.\"\n\n**Key Points:**\n*   「ならいざ知らず」 typically follows a noun or な-adjective, where the final 「だ」 is replaced by 「なら」.  It can also follow verbs in their plain form.\n*   This expression is considered **formal** and is more commonly found in written language or serious speech.\n*   The contrasting element introduced by 「いざ知らず」 often implies that the first situation might be an extreme case, making the second situation seem more reasonable or, conversely, highlighting its unexpected nature.\n*   While English translations often use \"but,\" there's no direct equivalent in the Japanese structure. The contrast arises from the juxtaposition of the unknown or less emphasized first part with the clearer second part.\n*   While less common, you might encounter 「はいざ知らず」, which carries the same meaning.",
