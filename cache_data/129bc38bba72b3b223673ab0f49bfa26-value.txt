  "writeup": "The grammar point ておく combines the て-form of a verb with the verb 置く (oku), meaning \"to put,\" \"to place,\" or \"to leave.\"  However, in this construction, 置く doesn't retain its literal meaning. Instead, ておく signifies doing something beforehand, often to prepare for a future event or situation.  Think of it as \"doing something and leaving it done\" for later. The future event might be immediate or far off;  it may be something desired or something one wants to prevent. This versatility makes ておく extremely useful.  For instance, one might use it to prepare for a future need or to ensure something doesn't happen.  Note that ておく is sometimes contracted to とく (or どく in verbs where て becomes で), particularly in informal settings and media like manga or anime.",
  "etymology": "The etymology lies in the verb 置く (oku). While literally meaning 'to place,' its extended meaning of 'to leave (something as it is)' is crucial to understanding ておく. The て-form indicates the completion of an action, and combining it with 置く creates the nuance of preparing something in advance, leaving the result in place until it's needed.",
