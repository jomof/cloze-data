    "etymology": "The etymology of 「あれ」 is uncertain, but it's believed to have originated from a demonstrative root in Old Japanese. It shares a common ancestor with other demonstrative pronouns like 「これ」 (this) and 「それ」 (that). The 'a' prefix generally indicates something further away from the speaker.",
    "writeup": "「あれ」, similar to 「これ」 and 「それ」, is a demonstrative pronoun in Japanese.  It translates to \"that\" or \"that over there\" in English. The key distinction for 「あれ」 is that it refers to something distant from **both** the speaker and the listener. Think of it as pointing to something far away.  It's **important** not to confuse this 「あれ」 with the interjection 「あれ？」 which means \"huh?\" or \"oh?\". The difference is usually clear from context and intonation; the interjection 「あれ？」 typically has a rising intonation.",
