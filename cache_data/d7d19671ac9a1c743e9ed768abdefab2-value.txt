  "writeup": "The suffix がけに, meaning \"on the way\" or \"as you go,\" is attached to the masu-stem of verbs.  It describes an action performed incidentally while doing something else.  Think of it as a coincidental action that happens during the primary activity. While not frequently encountered in modern casual speech, understanding がけに offers insight into a more nuanced and perhaps slightly older style of expression.  The structure itself, stemming from 掛ける (kakeru), evokes the image of something happening \"along the way,\" as if 'hanging' onto the main action. This subtle imagery adds depth to its meaning.  While the kanji is rarely used, remembering it can aid in comprehension.",

      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,

      "nuance": "The use of 「つい寄り道しちゃった」(tsui yorimichi shichatta) is very informal and expresses spontaneity and a slight sense of guilt for getting sidetracked, which adds to the flirty nuance.

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The intimate register 「あのね」(anone) and the sentence structure, 「あなたに会いにいく帰り道」(anata ni ai ni iku kaerimichi), which suggests that meeting the listener was the primary purpose, enhance the romantic implication.  The playful exclamation 「見つけちゃったの！」(mitsuketchatta no!) adds to the flirty tone."
