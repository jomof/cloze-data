  "writeup": "The adverbial particle きり indicates that an action or state, typically expressed by a verb in the plain past tense, a noun, or a counter, was the first and last time something happened, or that it represents a limit.  It's often translated as \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"since.\"  Understanding its nuances is crucial.  Think of きり as signifying a definitive endpoint or a single, decisive occurrence. With verbs, it suggests a single action resulting in a lasting consequence or change.  With nouns or counters, it limits the scope to the specified amount – \"nothing more, nothing less.\" The word きり itself comes from the verb 切る (kiru), meaning \"to cut.\"  This etymology reflects the sense of a clean break or a sharp limitation. Note that きり may also appear as きり or きり, with no significant difference in meaning, though きり is the most common casual form.",
  "etymology": "The particle きり originates from the verb 切る (kiru), meaning \"to cut.\"  This etymology perfectly encapsulates the function of the particle: to sharply delimit or define a point in time or a quantity.",
