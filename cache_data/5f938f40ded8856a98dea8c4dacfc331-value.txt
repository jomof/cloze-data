    "etymology": "The particle 「しか」 likely evolved from a combination of 「し」 (an emphatic particle) and 「か」 (a question particle). Over time, it transitioned to its current exclusive meaning, always used with a negative verb.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「しか」 is similar to 「だけ」 in that it expresses \"only.\" However, 「しか」 **must** be used with a negative verb. Thus, 「しか〜ない」 is translated as \"there's only (A)\" or \"there's nothing but (A).\" It's used to express limitations or exclusivity regarding nouns or quantities. It's important to remember the negative verb conjugation is required. For example, you can say 「水{しか} 飲ま{ない}」 to mean \"I drink nothing but water.\"",
