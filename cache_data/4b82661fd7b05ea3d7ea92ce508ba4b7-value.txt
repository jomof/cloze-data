  "writeup": "The verb 得る (uru/eru) means \"to gain\" or \"to acquire,\" but when used with the conjunctive form of other verbs, it signifies possibility or ability.  It suggests a potential that has been achieved or is achievable, a nuanced difference from できる (dekiru), which simply indicates potential.  Think of 得る as implying 'there's a possibility that (A) can be done' or 'the capacity to do (A) has been obtained.'  Importantly, 得る can be written using either える (eru) or うる (uru).  うる is an older, more literary form, less common in everyday speech. However, うる is often preferred when the preceding kana is え (e), for example, 教える (oshieru) becomes 教えうる (oshieyuru), not 教ええる (oshieeeru).  While often considered more formal than できる, several common expressions using 得る exist in everyday language, such as あり得る (ariuru) 'possible' and あり得ない (arinai) 'impossible'.",
  "etymology": "得る (uru/eru) comes from the classical Chinese character 得 (de), meaning \"to get\" or \"to obtain.\"  The Japanese reading うる (uru) reflects a more archaic pronunciation, while える (eru) is a modern adaptation. The nuance of possibility arises from the context of gaining the capacity or potential to perform an action.",

      "japanese": "考えうることは、すべてこの企画書に書いておきました！",
      "english": "I've written everything conceivable in this proposal!",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": "past (plain)",
      "nuance": "The use of 「考えうる」 (kangaeyuru) shows confident completeness, fitting a semi-formal professional context. The past tense 「書いておきました」 (kaite okimashita) adds politeness."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "いくら気をつけていても、交通事故は起こり得るものだ。",
      "english": "Even if you're careful, car accidents can happen.",
      "register": "standard",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the plain form 「起こり得る」 (okoriuru), conveying objectivity and matter-of-factness. The phrase 「ものだ」 adds a certain finality and gravity."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "もし出来得るならば、週末に旅行に行きたい。",
      "english": "If possible, I want to go on a trip this weekend.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": "conditional (provisional ば-form)",
      "nuance": "The use of 「出来得るならば」 (dekiru naraba) is slightly more formal than the simple 「できれば」 (dekireba) but still appropriate in a casual and friendly context. The speaker's desire is presented as a hopeful possibility."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "それはあり得るね。",
      "english": "That's possible, huh.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The casual 「ね」 (ne) at the end shows the speaker's ease with the listener. The casual register is appropriate because the speaker and listener likely have a friendly, informal relationship."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "君と二人っきりで、あり得ないくらい楽しい時間を過ごしたいな。",
      "english": "I want to spend an unbelievably fun time alone with you.",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The phrase 「二人っきりで」 (futari kiri de) and 「あり得ないくらい」 (ari e nai kurai) creates an intimate and suggestive tone that is common when flirting and expressing romantic interest. The 「な」 (na) at the end is a softening particle that helps create the intimate tone."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あのね、もしかしたら、君と…　もっと親しくなり得るかもしれないって…思ってるんだ。",
      "english": "Hey, maybe…maybe we could become closer…I think.",

      "conjugation": "potential",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The hesitant phrasing, use of 「あのね」 (ano ne), and the tentative 「かもしれない」 (kamoshirenai) reflect a situation where someone is taking a risk by expressing romantic interest.  The phrase 「もっと親しくなり得る」 (motto shitashiku nari uru) creates a sense of possibility and uncertainty. The soft speech style is appropriate for this setting."

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that  れる/られる (reru/rareru) describes inherent potential, while 得る (uru/eru) implies acquiring or achieving that potential.  Consider the context:  Is the ability inherent or newly gained? This will guide you towards the correct choice."
