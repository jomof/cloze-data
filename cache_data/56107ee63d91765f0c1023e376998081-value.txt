        "Register": "Varies depending on context, but generally neutral to slightly formal.",
        "Function": "Indicates two or more representative options, suggesting that any of them would be acceptable or possible.",
        "Nuance": "The speaker is presenting alternatives, implying that the specific choice isn't critical, as long as one of the options is taken."
    },
    "etymology": "「なり」 is thought to have originated from the verb 「なる」 (naru), meaning \"to become.\" In this grammar point, it takes on a function of presenting options, as if saying \"it will become this option or that option.\"",
    "writeup": "The 「なり〜なり」 grammar point is used to present two or more options as examples. It suggests that the specific choice between these options is not particularly important; the main point is that one of them should be chosen or is possible. It is similar to 「〜か〜」 or 「〜とか〜とか」, but 「なり〜なり」 often carries a nuance of indifference or a suggestion that either option is fine. It can connect nouns or verbs in dictionary form. This pattern is not particularly gendered or age-specific but is more common in slightly formal to neutral contexts.",
