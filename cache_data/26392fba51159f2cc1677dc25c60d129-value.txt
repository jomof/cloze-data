    "writeup": "だけでなく (an abbreviation of だけではなく) is a common construction in Japanese which translates to \"not only (A), but also (B)\". Sometimes the (B) statement may be left unsaid. This expression may connect to any (A) phrase that だけ would usually be able to connect to.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The で in ではない is not the particle で, but the auxiliary verb だ in its conjunctive form. は is regularly dropped from では expressions, or it may also be changed to じゃ, for ease of pronunciation.\n*   The conjunction particle て should follow なく, as it is the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective ない. However, the て in this particular construction is very often omitted.\n*   In writing, if there is no comma (known as a 読点 in Japanese) after なく, the full なくて construction will be required. When a comma is present, both forms are grammatically correct.",
