    "etymology": "The word 「手前」 originally meant \"the space in front of one's hands\" or \"oneself.\" Over time, it evolved to include meanings related to one's position, perspective, or the area immediately surrounding oneself. The nuance of obligation or constraint arises from the idea that one's actions must be considered in relation to their immediate surroundings or personal standing.",
    "writeup": "The noun 「手前」, meaning \"in front of,\" has several meanings depending on context. With a verb, it indicates that \"because of (A), (B) will happen.\" This often relates to something that has already occurred and the resulting course of action. Think of it as \"now that (A), (B)\" – accepting the current situation and moving forward. With a noun followed by 「の」, it indicates that (A) is the reason for (B), or simply describes something \"in front of\" (B). Essentially, 「手前」 highlights something \"facing\" the related noun or verb. A helpful way to understand this structure is as \"faced with (A), (B)\", similar to how English expresses a lack of options in certain situations.",
