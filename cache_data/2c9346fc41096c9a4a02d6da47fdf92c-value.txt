    "etymology": "「上で」 comes from the literal meaning of 「上」 (ue - above) and 「で」 (de), the case-marking particle indicating 'with' or 'by means of.' The idea is that action B is performed 'with' action A already 'above' or completed.",
    "writeup": "「上で」 is used to indicate that one action (B) takes place after another (A), where A is a prerequisite or a logical precursor to B. It is similar to \"after\" or \"upon\" in English.  This grammar point is primarily used in formal settings and is not common in casual conversation. It implies a logical progression or dependency between the two actions, where A should logically precede B. For example, you would consult the CEO 「社長」 before canceling a project. The first action, A, cannot be a passive verb. This is because passivity suggests a lack of control, which would contradict the implication that B is a planned consequence of A. 「上で」 strongly hints that A is a requirement for B, or A is something that would logically be expected before B.",
