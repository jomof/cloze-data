    "etymology": "The grammar point 「思うように」 is derived from the verb 「思う」 (omou, to think) and 「ように」, which is the conjunctive form of 「よう」 (you, way/manner). Thus, it literally means 'in the way one thinks'.",
    "writeup": "「思うように」 is used to describe situations where things either do or do not go as planned or expected. It combines the verb 「思う」 (to think) with 「ように」 (in the way that). The structure involves stating an expectation or plan (A), followed by 「思うように」, and then describing the actual outcome (B). This outcome can be positive, negative, or neutral, indicating whether the initial expectation was met, unmet, or exceeded.",
