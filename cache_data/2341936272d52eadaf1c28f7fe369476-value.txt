    "etymology": "が originates from the Classical Japanese particle 「我 (ga)」, which had a broader range of functions, including marking the subject and connecting clauses. Over time, its use evolved, and it eventually specialized to indicate contrast, concession, or continuation between clauses.",
    "writeup": "The particle が has several uses in Japanese, but they all share a common theme: highlighting (A) as important in relation to (B). When used to connect clauses, が often translates to \"but\" or \"however\" in English. It indicates that while the first clause is true or relevant, there is additional information or a contrasting idea to consider.\n\nが can be used directly after verbs and い-adjectives. However, when used with nouns or な-adjectives, one of the conjugations of だ or です is required before が. Using が with the meaning of \"but\" is considered more formal than other conjunctions like けど or でも because it directly asserts that there is additional information to be considered.\n\nImportant Consideration:\n\nSometimes a sentence will end with が. In these cases, it implies that more information exists but is obvious or unnecessary to state explicitly.",
