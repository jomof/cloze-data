    "etymology": "The grammar point 「がけに」 comes from 「掛け(かけ)」, the ます-stem of the verb 「掛ける(かける)」, meaning \"to hang, to place, to start.\" Here, it implies doing something while 'hanging off' or 'in the process' of doing something else. The 「に」 is a particle indicating time or location.",
    "writeup": "While not overly common in modern Japanese, 「がけに」 (often written without kanji) can appear after the ます-stem of a verb. It means \"on the way to,\" \"as you go,\" or \"while doing something.\" Essentially, action B is done while doing action A, or because action A presents a good opportunity. Think of action A as the main task, and action B as something you do while you are at it. For example, 「帰りがけにコンビニに寄った」 means 'I stopped by the convenience store on the way home.' It is not the same as intending to go to the convenience store, but just stopping by.",
