    "writeup": "だけのことはある is a grammar structure consisting of the particle だけ, の, こと, は, and the う-Verb ある. It is used when indicating that something about (A) is \"as expected\", or \"not surprising\". As a literal translation, it can be thought that the meaning is close to \"just in that it is (A), (B)\", and expresses that simply because (A) is (A), (B) is to be expected. だけのことはある will often appear with other words that add emphasis to the expectation of (A), such as さすが, やはり, or やっぱり. This grammar pattern may be seen following verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns. な will be required after な-Adjectives. In the case of nouns and な-Adjectives, it is also possible to see だっただけのことはある when highlighting that some particular result is not surprising. **Important Consideration:** だけのことはある is not used to indicate negative expectations, so will only appear when the overall sentence is a positive evaluation of what was expected of (A).",
