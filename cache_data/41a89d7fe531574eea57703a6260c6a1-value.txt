  "writeup": "The phrase に足る (ni taru) is a formal grammatical structure used to express sufficiency or worthiness.  It literally translates to \"to be sufficient\", but its nuanced meaning is far richer.  It's often used with verbs in their dictionary form or nouns to indicate that something is 'worthy of (A)' or 'enough for (A)'.  This construction is primarily found in formal writing and speeches, rarely used in everyday conversation.  It's important to note that に足る itself remains in its dictionary form and modifies a preceding verb or noun.  A second noun is always required to complete the meaning, indicating the thing that is or is not worthy or sufficient.  For example,  '尊敬に足る' (sonkei ni taru) means 'worthy of respect'.  When expressing insufficiency ('not worth'), the verb is negated, not に足る itself; you would not say に足らない. The focus shifts to the insufficiency of the action or quality rather than the insufficiency of the 'being' itself.",

  "etymology": "The verb 足る (taru) is related to 足 (ashi), meaning 'foot' or 'leg'.  The original sense seems to have been related to reaching a sufficient distance or level, and has evolved to indicate sufficiency or being up to a standard.",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion between に足る and たる, consider the context.  に足る always implies a comparison to a standard or requirement, while たる often describes inherent qualities or position.  The presence of a second noun or phrase expressing the standard/requirement will clearly distinguish に足る."
