    "etymology": "たまえ originates from the verb 給う (tamau), an honorific verb meaning \"to give\" or \"to bestow.\" The imperative form たまえ evolved from this verb and retains a sense of giving or granting permission, albeit in a commanding way.",
    "writeup": "たまえ is an imperative form derived from the verb 給う (tamau), meaning \"to give\" or \"to bestow.\" It's used to issue a mild command or request, often translated as \"please do (A).\" However, it's crucial to understand that たまえ is used **exclusively** by speakers of higher status to those of lower status. This hierarchical relationship should be evident between the speaker and the listener, such as between a boss and subordinate. Typically, this is used by men.\n\nHistorically, たまえ was also used in prayers to request favors or blessings. While this usage is rare in modern conversation, it may be encountered in older texts or literature.",
