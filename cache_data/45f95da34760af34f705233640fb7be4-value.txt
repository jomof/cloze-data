  "writeup": "The adverbial phrase と共に (to tomoni) means \"together with\" or \"at the same time as.\"  It elegantly links two events or states, suggesting simultaneity or a close relationship.  It's versatile, following verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns (with な-adjectives, sometimes preceded by である).  Think of it as highlighting the mutual existence or occurrence of two things.  While a simple translation might be 'along with,'  it carries a more sophisticated nuance, implying a deeper connection than just mere coexistence.  The structure itself reflects this subtle emphasis on mutual action or state of being.",
  "etymology": "と共に (to tomoni) is a compound phrase.  と (to) is the particle marking a conjunction, indicating \"and\" or \"with.\"  共に (tomoni) comes from 共 (tomo), meaning \"together,\" and に (ni), a particle indicating a manner or accompaniment. The combination beautifully encapsulates the simultaneous or mutually existing nature expressed by the phrase.",

While the synonyms listed above express related ideas,  と共に specifically highlights the co-occurrence or mutual existence of two elements. Choose the phrase that most precisely reflects the nature of the relationship between the elements in your sentence. Consider the degree of simultaneity, the causal relationship, and the overall emphasis you wish to create."
