    "etymology": "The slang 「つ」 is derived from 「という」, which is a combination of the quotation particle 「と」 and the verb 「言う (いう)」 meaning \"to say.\" The slang form simply shortens the verb 「言う」 to its first mora.",
    "writeup": "「つ」 is a slang abbreviation of 「という」, meaning \"called (A),\" \"that (A) that was said,\" or \"known as (A).\" It quotes something previously said or defines something in a very casual manner. You might also see it as 「っつ」 or 「つう」.\n\n「という」 itself is a combination of the quotation particle 「と」 and the verb 「言う」 (to say). Since 「と」 is the quotation particle, 「つ」 can follow almost any statement or word type.\n\nWhile 「つ」 is very strong slang, it's common in everyday speech. Native speakers often abbreviate 「という」 in various ways, with 「つ」 being the shortest.\n\nThe pause in 「っつ」 might indicate annoyance or impatience, but not always. However, the lengthened 「つう」 often has a softer feel.\n\nEven though 「言う」 is shortened, its conjugations still apply. Use forms like 「つった」 (past tense) or 「つってん」 (progressive form). Note that 「ている」 often becomes 「てん」 in slang.",
