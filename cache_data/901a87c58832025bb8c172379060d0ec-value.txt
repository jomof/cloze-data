  "writeup": "This grammar point focuses on the crucial distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs in Japanese.  Transitive verbs describe actions that *affect* an object, while intransitive verbs describe actions or states that occur within the subject itself.  The key difference lies in the particle used: transitive verbs take を (o) marking the direct object, whereas intransitive verbs generally use が (ga) to mark the subject.  Many verb pairs exist where one member is transitive and the other intransitive, often with subtle semantic shifts. Mastering this distinction is vital for accurate and nuanced expression.  Learning these pairs requires memorization; there's no consistent rule to predict the transitive or intransitive form.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The meaning can shift subtly between transitive and intransitive counterparts.\n*   Many verbs have both transitive and intransitive forms.  You'll need to learn each individually.\n*   Some verbs may only exist in one form (transitive or intransitive).",
