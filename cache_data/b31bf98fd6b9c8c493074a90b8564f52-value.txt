    "writeup": "The particle 「に」, when used to indicate location, specifies that an action is taking place **on** a surface. It's essential for describing physical interactions and locations where events occur. Unlike 「で」, which indicates the general location where something happens, 「に」 pinpoints the surface involved. For example, 「紙に書く」 (kami ni kaku) means \"to write on the paper,\" specifying the paper as the surface. Consider also situations like 「ハンガーにかける」 (hangā ni kakeru) – \"to hang on the hanger.\"",
    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 has ancient roots, stemming from a word that indicated direction or destination. Over time, its function broadened to include the indication of specific locations and surfaces where actions occur.",
