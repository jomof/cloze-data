  "writeup": "The grammar point 見られる (mirareru) is the potential/passive form of the verb 見る (miru, to see).  While seemingly simple, its nuance lies in its context. Unlike 見える (mieru, to be visible), which focuses on the inherent visibility of something, 見られる emphasizes the *ability* or *opportunity* to see something, often implying some effort or circumstance is required.  This makes it particularly suitable for describing trends, changes, or things that are not always readily apparent.  Therefore, 見られる often translates as 'can be observed,' 'is evident,' or 'it can be seen that...' The passive interpretation, although possible, is often secondary to the potential meaning, especially in informal contexts. The usage of ら抜き言葉 (omitting the 'ra') is primarily limited to the potential interpretation, never passively. Let's explore this through examples.",
  "etymology": "見られる is formed by combining the verb stem 見 (mi, to see) with the potential/passive suffix -られる (-rareru). The -rareru suffix itself evolved from an older form involving the verb 'れる' (reru) indicating possibility. The combination of these elements creates a nuance of both potential and passive voice, depending on context.",

      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The phrase 「ゆっくり話せる見込みがある」suggests a hopeful anticipation and gentle flirtation, appropriate for a male speaker expressing interest to a female listener.  The casual register and use of 「見込みがある」 reinforce the softer approach.  Using the plain non-past conjugation makes it straightforward and natural."

      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The sentence 「君の笑顔が、私の心を温かくする効果がある」 employs a casual register to create a comfortable and intimate atmosphere suitable for a first encounter. The use of 「君の」 instead of 「あなたの」 conveys a closer, more personal feeling. The plain non-past 「ある」 emphasizes the present effect."

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the choice between the potential and passive interpretations of 見られる depends heavily on the surrounding context.
