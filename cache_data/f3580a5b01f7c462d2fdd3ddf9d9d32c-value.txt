  "etymology": "This grammar point combines the る-verb stem with the negative past auxiliary verb. The plain form uses 「なかった」, which is the past negative form of 「ない」. The polite form uses 「ませんでした」, which is the past negative form of 「ます」. The semi-polite 「なかったです」 is formed by attaching the polite copula 「です」 to the plain negative past 「なかった」.",
  "writeup": "To create the negative past form of a る-verb (also known as a vowel-stem verb or ichidan verb), you remove the 「る」 from the dictionary form. For the plain negative past, you append 「なかった」, which is the past negative form of the auxiliary verb 「ない」. For the polite form, you append 「ませんでした」, which is the past negative form of the auxiliary verb 「ます」. These forms indicate that an action did not occur in the past.\n\nAdditionally, a semi-polite form, constructed by attaching 「です」 to 「なかった」 (e.g., 「なかったです」), is commonly used. Although this form is not strictly grammatically correct, its widespread prevalence means that many native speakers and linguistic resources consider it acceptable in everyday speech.",
