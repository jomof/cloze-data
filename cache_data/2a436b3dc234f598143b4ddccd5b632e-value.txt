        "Register": "Generally polite form 「あります」is used in formal speech.",
        "Usage": "Used to indicate the existence of inanimate objects, places, or abstract concepts. It can also indicate possession.",

    "etymology": "The origins of 「ある」 are ancient, tracing back to the early stages of the Japanese language. It evolved from a concept of physical presence or location, solidifying over time into its current meaning as a verb indicating existence.",

Its polite form is 「あります」, which is generally used in formal speech. The opposite of 「ある」 is 「ない」 (to not exist, to not have).  Remember that for living things (people and animals), you must use the verb 「いる」 instead.",
