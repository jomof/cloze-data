    "formation": {
        "[Plain form verb] + だろう": "Expresses conjecture or probability.",
        "[い-adjective] + だろう": "Expresses conjecture or probability.",
        "[な-adjective stem] + だろう": "Expresses conjecture or probability. *な adjective often takes 'だ' or 'だった' before だろう",
        "[Noun] + だろう": "Expresses conjecture or probability. *Noun often takes 'だ' or 'だった' before だろう"
    },
    "etymology": "「だろう」 is derived from the copula 「だ」, combined with the volitional auxiliary 「う」. Over time, it evolved from expressing intention to expressing conjecture or probability. The polite form is 「でしょう」, stemming from 「です」.",
    "writeup": "「だろう」 is used to express the speaker's conjecture, probability, or uncertain assertion. It implies that the speaker thinks something is likely true but lacks definitive evidence. It's similar to saying \"probably\" or \"isn't it?\" in English. The polite equivalent is 「でしょう」. It can be used after verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. For な-adjectives and nouns, 「だ」 or 「だった」 is often inserted before 「だろう」 to create a grammatically correct sentence. For example, 「綺麗だろう」 is 「綺麗**だ**ろう」, and 「先生だろう」 is 「先生**だ**ろう」. The 「か」 particle is typically added to the end of the sentence to soften the statement and turn it into a question. Please note, 「だろう」 is generally considered more casual and can have a slightly more masculine nuance compared to 「でしょう」.",
