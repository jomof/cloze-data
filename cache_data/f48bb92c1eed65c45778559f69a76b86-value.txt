        "writeup": "か is a particle that frequently comes at the end of sentences in Japanese, functioning similarly to a question mark in English. It's not strictly limited to appearing at the end of sentences, however. Besides forming questions, か can also express uncertainty or doubt. か typically follows polite forms like 〜です か and 〜ます か. However, in casual speech, か can directly follow the word about which the speaker is uncertain. Both usages are grammatically correct, but omitting です in a question might sound too direct and thus be perceived as rude by some.",
