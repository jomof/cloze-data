  "writeup": "予定だ (yotei da) is an expression indicating a plan or schedule.  It's similar to つもりだ (tsumori da), meaning 'to intend to,' but 予定 emphasizes a concrete plan rather than a mere intention.  Therefore, 予定 is more frequently used for formal arrangements, like scheduled meetings or appointments.  Attach 予定 to the plain, non-past form of a verb, or to a noun (adding の).  Crucially, omitting だ or です changes the meaning.  Instead of expressing a planned action, it acts as an adjective modifying the preceding word.  This is a subtle but essential difference in meaning. For example, 'I have plans to eat with a friend' is natural, whereas 'I have an eating-with-a-friend plan' sounds unnatural.",
  "etymology": "予定 (yotei) combines 予 (yo) meaning 'preliminary' or 'in advance' and 定 (tei) meaning 'to decide' or 'to fix.'  The suffix だ (da) is a copula, indicating that something is a fact or state of being.",
