  "writeup": "The grammar point \"あまり～ない\" expresses the idea of 'not very' or 'not much.'  The word \"あまり\" itself means 'excess' or 'too much,' so the construction implies a lack of excess, resulting in 'not very much' of something.  It's paired with the negative form (ない) of verbs or adjectives, softening the negativity.  \"あまり\" can be used in both formal and informal settings, although the more casual \"あんまり\" is appropriate for close friends or family.   Understanding the underlying meaning of \"あまり\" as 'excess' helps to appreciate the nuance of the entire construction. This is a very versatile and useful construction, suitable for a wide range of situations. ",
  "etymology": "The word \"あまり\" originates from the kanji 余り, meaning 'remainder,' 'surplus,' or 'excess.'  This etymology reflects its use in expressing a lack of something, a deficiency compared to an excessive amount.",
