  "writeup": "相まって is a formal structure indicating a synergistic effect where two factors (A and B) combine to produce a result (C). While A or B might individually achieve C, their combined action yields a superior or more significant outcome.  It combines 相 (mutual, reciprocal) and the て-form of the verb 俟つ (matsu, to wait on).  The nuance is subtle, suggesting interdependence between A and B to bring about C.  A and B usually precede 相まって, marked by と or が. Common translations include '(A) combined with (B) will (C)' or 'coupled with (A), (B) will (C)'.  A more literal rendering is 'mutually depending on each other, (C)'.  The usage of 俟つ, while less common in modern Japanese, often results in its rendering in hiragana.  The etymology reveals a fascinating nuance: while similar to 待つ (matsu, to wait for), 俟つ focuses on waiting for something *to happen* after A and B come together, emphasizing their interdependence.",
  "etymology": "The grammar point 相まって is built upon the verb 俟つ (matsu), meaning 'to wait on' or 'to await.'  Unlike the more common verb 待つ (matsu), meaning 'to wait for,' 俟つ implies a passive waiting for an event or consequence to unfold *after* a combination of actions or factors. This subtle difference imparts a sense of mutual dependence and synergistic outcome. The kanji 相 (ai) adds the layer of 'mutual' or 'reciprocal' action, reinforcing the idea of combined effect.",
