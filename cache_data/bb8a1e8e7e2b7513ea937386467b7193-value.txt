    "details": {

    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「しまう (shimau)」 originally meant “to put away” or “to store.”  The nuance evolved to include the idea of something being completed or finished, often with a sense of finality or irreversibility. When attached to the て-form of a verb, this finality can express completion, regret over an action, or the sense that something happened unintentionally.",
    "writeup": "By combining the conjunction particle **て**, with the verb **しまう** (sometimes written as **終う**), you are able to express that something was done \"by accident\", \"completely\", or \"unfortunately\". These meanings may seem quite different, but consider the underlying sense of finality. Let's look at a few examples of **てしまう** first.\n\nAs we can see, verbs that usually take **で** instead of **て** will be no different when using **てしまう**. For example, 飲んでしまう.\n\nSometimes, **てしまう** or **でしまう** will be shortened to more casual forms, which are often used in speech. These forms are as follows:\n\n*   **てしまう** will become **ちゃう**\n*   **でしまう** will become **じゃう**\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nWhile **て終う** is most frequently written in hiragana, **て仕舞う** may also be seen. There is a slight nuance difference between these two kanji structures, but the primary meaning of **しまう** will always be that \"something has come to the point where ending/ending up in a specific state cannot be avoided\". This \"no turning back point\" may be temporary (likely to be written as **仕舞う**), or it may be permanent (likely to be written as **終う**).\n\nDue to this \"cannot be avoided\" nuance, **しまう** often comes across as \"totally\", as in \"ah… I totally left the chicken in the oven for too long\". In these cases, it is simply expressing the speaker's exasperation that something is \"too late\" to change. However, despite regularly being used negatively, **てしまう** can also be used positively. In these cases it still has the nuance of \"no turning back\", suggesting a deliberate decision to complete something.",
