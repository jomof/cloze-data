    "etymology": "末 (sue) literally means \"end\" or \"tip.\" The grammar point indicates arriving at a certain conclusion or result after a series of events, struggles, or considerations, as if reaching the very end of a process.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「た末・の末」, using 末 (sue) meaning \"end tip,\" indicates that something (B) results after a prolonged action or consideration (A). When used with a verb, it appears in its past form 「た」. When used with a noun, の is inserted. \n\n「末に」 marks the 'tip' as the point from which something results.\n\nWhile this grammar pattern is usually translated as \"after (A), (B)\" or \"as a result of (A), (B),\" the nuance emphasizes that various things have happened along the way before finally reaching the 'point' or 'conclusion' of (A). 「末に」 can highlight either positive or negative results but suggests that some long-lasting effort or struggle eventually resulted in (B).",
