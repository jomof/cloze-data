    "etymology": "に引き換え is derived from the case-marking particle に, the conjunctive form of the う-Verb 引く (hiku) 'to pull,' 引き (hiki), and the conjunctive form of the る-Verb 換える (kaeru) 'to switch between' or 'to interchange,' 換え (kae). The literal sense involves \"pulling back\" from one thing and \"switching\" to another.",
    "writeup": "に引き換え is a grammar pattern used for making contrasts between two distinct things. It conveys a strong sense of \"in comparison to (A), (B),\" or \"in stark contrast to (A), (B).\" The nuance suggests a significant difference, almost like \"pulling back and switching away from (A) to (B).\" \n\nThis grammar point commonly presents a **clear opposition**: one aspect is usually considered positive, while the other is considered negative, based on the speaker's subjective viewpoint.\n\nに引き換え can follow various word types but requires の before い-adjectives or verbs and なの before な-adjectives. Additionally, それにひきかえ can begin sentences, drawing a comparison to a previous statement. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   Both (A) and (B) represent observable or measurable facts.\n*   に引き換え is not typically used for assumptions or guesses.",
