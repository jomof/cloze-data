  "writeup": "にとどまらず is a formal structure combining the case-marking particle に, the -u verb 止まる ('to remain,' 'to be limited to'), and the classical auxiliary verb ず ('not').  It's generally translated as 'not limited to (A)' or 'not stopping at (A),' following words indicating an extent before explaining something beyond (A).  にとどまらず follows nouns or verbs in their dictionary form. This expression can highlight positive or negative effects.  **Important Consideration:** にとどまらず is used when (B) expands outward from (A)'s boundaries; (B) must be directly tied to (A).",
  "etymology": "This grammar point's etymology lies in the combination of classical grammatical elements.  The use of ず, a negative auxiliary verb from classical Japanese, contributes to its formal register and emphasizes the exceeding of a limit.  The verb 止まる, meaning 'to stop' or 'to remain,' underscores the concept of limitation being surpassed.",
