    "etymology": "The term 「はず」 comes from 「筈」, which suggests that something is 'bound' to be true. 「はずがない」 therefore suggests that something is 'not bound' to be true.",
    "writeup": "「はずがない」 suggests that something is 'not bound' to be true. While often translated as 'hardly possible', 'improbable', or 'unlikely', it's often a weaker statement than these, more literally conveying '(A) is not the only possibility'. Because 「はずがない」 (「筈」 + case-marking particle 「が」 + い-adjective 「ない」) starts with a noun, it can follow any word that typically connects with a noun.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\nThere's a significant nuance difference between 「ないはずだ」 ('bound not to') and 「はずがない」 ('not bound to'). 「ないはずだ」 strongly negates statement A, expressing the speaker's opinion that it is almost definitely untrue. 「はずがない」, on the other hand, simply suggests that A being almost 100% true is not the case.",
