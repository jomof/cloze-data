    "etymology": "「途中」 (tochuu) literally means \"mid-way\" or \"in the course of\". 「に」 (ni) indicates a location or time, and 「で」 (de) indicates a place where an action occurs or a means by which something is done. Therefore, 「途中に」 emphasizes the point in time or location along the way, while 「途中で」 highlights the action or event happening during that time.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「途中に・途中で」 (tochuu ni/de) means \"on the way\", \"partway through\", or \"in the middle of\". 「途中」 (tochuu) means \"on the way\", and adding the particle 「に」 (ni) or 「で」 (de) indicates that something is being done on the way to a destination or during an activity. It can follow nouns with 「の」 (no) or verbs in their dictionary form.\n\n「に」 (ni) emphasizes the time or duration, while 「で」 (de) emphasizes the process as the cause or opportunity for something else. The meanings can overlap, so understanding the nuance requires multiple examples.",
