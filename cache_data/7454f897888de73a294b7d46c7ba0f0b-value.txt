    "etymology": "「関係」 (kankei) means 'relationship' or 'connection.' 「が」 (ga) is a particle indicating the subject, and 「ある」 (aru) means 'to exist' or 'to have.' So, literally, it means 'a relationship exists.'",
    "writeup": "When the noun 「関係」, meaning \"a relation,\" is paired with 「がある」, meaning \"to have,\" it creates a phrase similar to \"involved with (A),\" \"concerning (A),\" or \"in relation to (A).\" 「関係がある」 is often preceded by the case-marking particle 「に」, expressing the location 'where' the connection exists. 「に」 itself is always preceded by a noun or noun-phrase.\n\nAlternatively, 「に」 can be replaced by other case-marking particles such as 「と」 or 「の」. Each has a slightly different nuance but they are used quite interchangeably:\n*   「に関係がある」 - Relating to (A).\n*   「と関係がある」 - Related with (A).\n*   「の関係がある」 - Having a relation with (A).\n\nNaturally, 「ある」 may be replaced by 「ない」 to express that there is \"no relation\" between (A) and (B).\n\n**Important Considerations**\nThe primary difference between 「に」 and 「と」 in this grammar pattern is that 「に」 highlights the relationship from a single perspective, while 「と」 focuses more on how (A) and (B) are related together.",
