  "writeup": "The adverbial particle しか is often compared to だけ, as both express 'only'.  However, unlike だけ, しか can only be used in negative statements.  Because of this, しか～ない is regularly translated as 'there's only (A)', or 'there's nothing but (A)'.  しか～ない can express numbers or nouns; this lesson focuses on numbers.  To use this construction, place the number expressing the limited quantity before しか, followed by a verb in its negative form (ない or ありません).  The nuance is crucial:  While だけ suggests a choice from among several options, しか implies *no other choices exist*.  This subtle difference significantly affects the meaning.",
  "etymology": "The particle しか originates from the ancient word  『只か』 (sika), meaning 'only'.  The modern usage retains this core meaning but has evolved to be used specifically within negative contexts, creating a unique grammatical construction.",
