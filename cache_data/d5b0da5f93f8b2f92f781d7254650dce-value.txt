  "writeup": "っぽい (occasionally also seen as ぽい) is a suffix that can be attached to various word types to create new い-adjectives.  It indicates something exhibiting the characteristics of something else, often concerning behavior or appearance.  In English, it's often translated as '-ish,' '-like,' or 'a tendency to.'  Importantly, っぽい quite often carries a negative connotation.  Since it creates い-adjectives, it can be used with the conjunctive form of verbs or the stem form of other words.  Be cautious, as っぽい itself conjugates like regular い-adjectives. The meaning subtly shifts depending on the word it modifies:\n\n* **Verb + っぽい:** To have a tendency to do (A)\n* **Adjective + っぽい:** To exhibit all the signs of being (A)\n* **Noun + っぽい:** To obviously *not* be (A), yet show some signs of it\n\nTherefore, っぽい is subjective, reflecting the speaker's opinion rather than inherent qualities.  The speaker perceives an excess of (A) compared to what's expected, leading to the negative connotation.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of ぽい is uncertain, but it's likely an onomatopoeia or mimetic word suggesting a vague resemblance or impression.  Its usage reflects a subjective and often slightly critical assessment of a situation or quality.",
