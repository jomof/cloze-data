    "etymology": "The particle 「しか」 historically comes from the adverb 「然」 (shika), meaning \"in that way\" or \"so\". Over time, it evolved to emphasize limitation. The 「ない」 is the negative form of 「ある」 (aru), meaning \"to exist\" or \"to have\".  Therefore, 「しか〜ない」 literally implies that something exists in a limited or exclusive way.",
    "writeup": "The construction **Number + しか〜ない** expresses the idea of \"only\" or \"no more than\" when referring to a quantity.  It's **important** to remember that しか is always used with a negative verb ending (ない or ありません). While often compared to だけ, which also means \"only\", しか carries a nuance of limitation or that the quantity is surprisingly small or insufficient.  Unlike だけ, which can be used in positive statements, しか **must** be used with a negative verb. Think of it as emphasizing that there are *no other options* or that the quantity is the *absolute maximum*. For example, 「３個だけあります」 means \"I have only three\", suggesting you might have preferred more, but 「３個しかない」 emphasizes that three is the total and perhaps surprisingly few.",

If you simply want to state that something is the sole item or option without this additional nuance, 「だけ」 is suitable. Pay attention to whether the verb is negative or positive – this is the clearest grammatical difference."
