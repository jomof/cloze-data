        "Register": "Varies depending on conjugation. Can be used in casual and formal settings.",

    "etymology": "The verb 「分かる」originally stems from the verb「別れる」(wakareru), meaning \"to separate\" or \"to distinguish\". The connection lies in the idea that understanding something involves distinguishing it from other things, thereby clarifying its nature. Over time, 「分かる」evolved to specifically denote comprehension and understanding.",
    "writeup": "「分かる・わかる」 means \"to understand\" or \"to comprehend\". It is an intransitive verb, meaning it describes a state of being rather than an action performed on an object. The basic pattern for this verb is often the は〜が pattern, where the thing being understood is marked with 「が」. The experiencer of 「分かる」often takes 「に」, although this is optional.  Compared to 「知る」(shiru - to know), 「分かる」 implies a deeper level of comprehension or insight, rather than simply being aware of something's existence. 「知る」 indicates knowing a fact, while 「分かる」 implies understanding the meaning or implications of that fact. It is a very common verb used in everyday conversation.",
