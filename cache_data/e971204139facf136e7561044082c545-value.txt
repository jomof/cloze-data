  "writeup": "The grammar point \"にしても～にしても\" (ni shite mo ~ ni shite mo) translates to \"regardless of whether... or...\" in English.  It's a versatile construction expressing that a certain outcome holds true irrespective of two contrasting options.  While often used with contrasting positive and negative verb forms, it's adaptable to various contrasting nouns, verbs, or adjectives.  The structure involves \"ni\" (に), the \"te-form\" (て形) of the verb \"suru\" (する) – to do – and \"mo\" (も).  Think of it as a sophisticated way to emphasize the invariance of an outcome despite different circumstances.  Importantly, while frequently interchangeable with ～にしても,～にしろ, and～にせよ, the latter two options tend towards a more direct, less nuanced tone, making them less suitable for formal contexts.  This subtle difference in implication should be noted.",
  "etymology": "The structure hinges on the combination of \"ni\" (に), indicating a circumstantial element; the te-form of \"suru\" (する), suggesting a process or action; and \"mo\" (も), emphasizing inclusiveness or regardlessness.  The repetition underscores the duality of choice, highlighting the ultimate indifference to either option.",
