    "etymology": "「前」 (zen) means \"before\" or \"front,\" and 「後」 (kō) means \"after\" or \"behind.\" 「者」 (sha) means \"person\" or \"thing\" and is often used to refer to a party or entity. Therefore, 「前者」 refers to the 'thing that came before' and 「後者」 to the 'thing that came after'.",
    "writeup": "「前者は」 and 「後者は」 are used in the same way as \"the former\" and \"the latter\" in English. These nouns frequently appear in Japanese to contrast two items. The particle 「は」 follows each word to emphasize the contrast. 「前者」 refers to \"the former,\" while 「後者」 refers to \"the latter.\" Each appears at the beginning of its respective statement, with a comment about each one.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nStatements using 「前者」 and 「後者」 require a clear relationship between the items being compared. This is usually evident from the context, but you should be mindful of it when constructing your own sentences.",
