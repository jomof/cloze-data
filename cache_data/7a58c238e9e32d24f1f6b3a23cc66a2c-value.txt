        "Usage": "Used to describe an action about to happen or an attempt to do something. Often implies effort or intention, but sometimes also futility. Common in writing and formal speech.",
        "Exception": "する becomes せんとする"

    "etymology": "The 「ん」 in 「んとする」 is a transformed version of 「む」, an old auxiliary verb indicating intention or conjecture. Thus, the grammar point carries a nuance of intent or imminence.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「んとする」 expresses that someone is just about to do something, or that they are trying to do something. It often implies a sense of imminence, effort, or intention. It is typically used in formal writing and speech. This grammar point is related to 「ようとする」, but 「んとする」 is generally considered more literary and formal. \n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   This grammar point is often used to describe situations where an action is interrupted or does not fully come to fruition.\n*   The 「ん」 is a particle derived from the older verb 「む」, indicating intention. When using 「する」, it becomes 「せんとする」.\n*   While 「んとする」 can be used in conversation, it is far more common in written Japanese.",
