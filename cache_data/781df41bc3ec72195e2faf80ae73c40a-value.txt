    "writeup": "たちまち is an adverb that conveys the feeling of something happening \"suddenly\" or \"in a flash.\" The primary nuance of たちまち, compared to similar structures, is that it indicates something happened spontaneously and was not able to be controlled.\n\nIn many cases, たちまち indicates something entering a new, ongoing state, or something being completed. It often appears directly before the verb phrase it modifies, describing the new state.\n\nEtymologically, たちまち originally comes from the kanji structure 忽ち, with the kanji itself meaning \"without thought.\" This nuance is retained, as all actions associated with the word indicate a lack of planning or forethought. Despite this origin, the kanji is rarely used in modern writing.",
    "etymology": "The word たちまち originates from the kanji 忽ち, meaning 'without thought'. This reflects the spontaneous, unplanned nature of events described by たちまち.",
