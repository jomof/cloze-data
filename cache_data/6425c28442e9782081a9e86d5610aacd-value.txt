    "etymology": "がる is believed to have originated from the verb 気(け)張(は)る (kebaru), which means \"to brace oneself,\" \"to show off,\" or \"to be eager.\" Over time, the meaning evolved to express the outward manifestation of inner feelings or desires.",
    "writeup": "がる is a う-verb that is primarily used as a suffix in Japanese. It indicates that someone other than the speaker **shows signs of feeling or wanting something**. When used this way, it means \"to act like (A)\" or \"to show signs of being (A),\" where (A) is the word it's attached to.\n\nTo use がる, link it to the stem form of an い-adjective (remove the い) or the stem form of a な-adjective (don't include the な). がる is a verb that means \"to give the impression of (A)\" or \"to act like (A).\" This is important because you wouldn't usually say how someone else feels unless they told you directly. If you're repeating what you heard, use the quotation particle と.\n\nWhen you want to express how you *think* someone else feels without direct information, がる is natural. For example, seeing someone shivering in the cold, you'd say something like 「寒がる」.\n\nThe main difference between がる and がっている is that がる describes how a person usually/always acts, while がっている describes how someone/something is acting at a specific moment.\n\nがる can also describe yourself (in the third person) when expressing how you think you act or how you assume others view your behavior.\n\nThe use of がっている to express an \"in the moment\" way someone is acting is becoming less common in modern Japanese. Often, そう is used instead to express that someone \"seems\" a certain way.",
