        "Usage": "いず(れ) is a formal adverb commonly used as a part of polite language with the same meaning as words like 何 'what', どう 'how', どちら 'where', etc. When combined with the adverbial particle も, いずれも may be translated as 'any (A)', or 'all of (A)'. However, the more literal translation is 'how even (A)', 'where even (A)', or 'what even (A)'.",
        "Kanji Forms": "いずれ may be seen in the kanji forms of either 何れ or 孰れ, with the latter being far less common, but still relatively easy to come across in literature.",
        "Set-phrases": "いずれにしても, いずれにせよ, and いずれにしろ are all fairly common set-phrases that can be translated as 'in the end', 'at any rate', or 'in any case'. The more literal translation for this particular pattern is 'whatsoever comes about' and is used to express that some particular result cannot be avoided."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「いずれ」 comes from the verb 「言う」 (iu, to say) and originally meant \"which one is said?\" The 「も」 particle adds the nuance of \"all\" or \"also\", thus 「いずれも」 implies 'all of those which could be said/chosen'.",
    "writeup": "「いずれも」 is a formal adverb that translates to \"all\", \"both\", or \"none\", depending on the context. It's related to the more basic word 「いずれ」, which can mean \"which\", \"where\", or \"when\". The addition of 「も」 emphasizes that the statement applies to every item or option being considered.\n\nIt's often encountered in set phrases like 「いずれにしても」, 「いずれにせよ」, and 「いずれにしろ」, all meaning \"in any case\" or \"at any rate\". These phrases emphasize that a particular outcome is unavoidable, regardless of circumstances.",
