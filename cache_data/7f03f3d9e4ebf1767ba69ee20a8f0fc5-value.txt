    "writeup": "The grammar point 「中を」 uses the noun 「中」, meaning \"inside\", combined with the case-marking particle 「を」. This particle, in this context, indicates the **place where an action occurs**.  Therefore, 「中を」 signifies \"doing something **in**, **on**, **into**, or **inside of** (a location)\".\n\nHere, (A) 「中を」 marks the location, and (B) represents the action being performed. \n\n**Important Consideration:** The person or thing performing the action indicated by 「中を」 might not be physically situated within the noun being marked. For instance, verbs like 「覗く」(to peer) illustrate actions directed *into* a space rather than strictly occurring within it.",
