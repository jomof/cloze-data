    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に際して」 comes from 「際する(さいする)」, a verb meaning \"to occur; to take place.\" The 「て」 form connects it to the preceding noun or verb, indicating the timing or occasion of an event.",
    "writeup": "Similar to 「際に」 meaning \"on the occasion of (A),\" 「に際して」 indicates a specific occasion, often a one-time event or chance occurrence. Unlike 「際に」, 「に際して」 combines 「に」 with the 「て」-form of 「際する」, a verb meaning \"to come to pass.\" While it can be literally translated as \"when (A) comes to pass,\" it's generally interpreted as \"on the occasion of (A)\" or \"at the time of (A).\" This is a formal grammar pattern used with nouns or verbs in the dictionary form.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「に際して」 is used when (B) is something done before (A) or when presented with the situation of (A).
*   「際に」 emphasizes the exact point in time of an occasion, while 「に際して」 highlights the approach to that time.
*   Because it highlights the approach to a specific situation, 「に際して」 never appears with verbs in the past tense. 「際に」, however, frequently appears with verbs in the past tense.",
