        "{V/Adj(i)/Adj(na)/Noun + Copula} (Negative form) + ことはない": "Expresses a double negative, implying a weak affirmation or possibility."

    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ないことはない」 is a double negative expression. The literal translation is \"it's not that (A) does not exist\", but it effectively means \"(A) is possible\" or \"it's not that (A) isn't the case\". Think of it as a softer, less direct way of saying something *is* possible or *is* true. It conveys nuance that it might be possible but not necessarily likely, or that something is true but not to a great extent.\n\nThis structure can be used with verbs, i-adjectives, na-adjectives, and nouns + the copula 「だ」. Simply conjugate the verb or adjective into its negative form (ない-form) and attach 「ことはない」.\n\nFor example:\n*   食べられないことはない (taberarenai koto wa nai) - \"It's not that I can't eat it.\" (Implies the speaker *can* eat it, but may not want to or enjoy it much).\n*   高くないことはない (takakunai koto wa nai) - \"It's not that it isn't expensive.\" (Implies it *is* somewhat expensive).\n*   静かではないことはない (shizuka dewa nai koto wa nai) - \"It's not that it isn't quiet.\" (Implies it *is* reasonably quiet).",
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「ないことはない」 comes from the combination of 「ない」 (nai), the negative form of a verb or adjective, 「こと」 (koto), meaning 'thing' or 'matter', and 「は」 (wa), the topic marker. Together, they create a double negative structure implying that a certain state or action is not entirely nonexistent, suggesting a degree of possibility or truth.",
