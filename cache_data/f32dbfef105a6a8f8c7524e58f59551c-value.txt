    "etymology": "「一切」 originally comes from Buddhist terminology, referring to 「すべてのもの」(all things). Over time, it evolved to emphasize a complete negation, meaning "not even one thing." The 「ない」 is the plain negative form of 「ある」(to exist), reinforcing the sense of complete absence.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「一切〜ない」 expresses a complete negation. It conveys the meaning of \"not at all,\" \"absolutely not,\" or \"not whatsoever.\" It's stronger than 「全然〜ない」 or 「全く〜ない」. 「一切」 modifies the negative verb to emphasize the totality of the negation. It's often used in formal writing and speech to express a firm denial or absence of something. You can use it with verbs in the negative form or with nouns to indicate the absence of something.",
