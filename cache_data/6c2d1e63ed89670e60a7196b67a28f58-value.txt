    "etymology": "The word どこ (doko) is derived from the demonstrative series of words: こ (ko, near speaker), そ (so, near listener), あ (a, away from both), and ど (do, interrogative). どこ is the interrogative form, asking 'which place?' or 'where?'",
    "writeup": "どこ (doko) is an interrogative word used to ask about a location. It's similar to how どれ (dore) represents \"which\", どこ represents \"which place\", or simply \"where\".  **Important:** Be careful not to confuse どこ with どっち (docchi), which also translates to \"where\" sometimes. どっち emphasizes the *direction* someone or something is moving, whereas どこ focuses on the *place* itself.",
