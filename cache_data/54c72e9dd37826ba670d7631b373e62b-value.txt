    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 in this context originates from its general function as a marker indicating a close relationship or association between two elements. Here, it connects the quoted content directly to the act of saying, thinking, or writing it.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「と」 functions as a quotation marker in Japanese. It indicates the content being quoted, thought, or described. This usage of 「と」 is referred to as 引用 (引用, in'you), signifying \"reference\" or \"citation.\" It follows the quoted text and is typically succeeded by a verb indicating the nature of the quotation, such as 言う (いう, iu) \"to say,\" 思う (おもう, omou) \"to think,\" 考える (かんがえる, kangaeru) \"to consider,\" or 聞く (きく, kiku) \"to hear.\" The verb can often be omitted at the end of a sentence.\n\nWhen quoting nouns or な-adjectives, the particle 「だ」 is necessary before 「と」. Essentially, 「と」 establishes a direct connection between the content communicated and the manner of its communication.  Think of it as similar to quotation marks in English, but without the marks themselves.",
