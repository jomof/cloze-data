    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てしまう」 is composed of the verb 「て」 form, which connects actions, and 「しまう」, originally meaning \"to put away\" or \"to finish.\" Over time, 「しまう」 evolved to express the nuances of completion, regret, or doing something unintentionally.",
    "writeup": "By combining the particle **te** (て) with the verb 「しまう」 (sometimes written as 「終う」), you can express that something was done \"by accident,\" \"completely,\" or \"unfortunately.\" These meanings may seem different, but they share similarities. Let's examine examples of 「てしまう」. Verbs that usually take 「で」 instead of 「て」 will behave the same way with 「てしまう」. Sometimes, 「てしまう」 or 「でしまう」 is shortened to a more casual form, often used in speech. 「てしまう」 becomes 「ちゃう」 and 「でしまう」 becomes 「じゃう」.\n\nWhile 「て終う」 is frequently written in hiragana, 「て仕舞う」 may also be seen. There's a subtle difference; the primary meaning of 「しまう」 is that something has reached a point where ending up in a specific state cannot be avoided. This \"no turning back\" point may be temporary (likely written as 「仕舞う」) or permanent (likely written as 「終う」).\n\nDue to this \"cannot be avoided\" nuance, 「しまう」 often comes across as \"totally,\" as in \"Ah… I totally left the chicken in the oven for too long.\" It expresses the speaker's exasperation that something is \"too late\" to change. However, despite being used negatively, 「てしまう」 can also be used positively, maintaining the nuance of \"no turning back.\"",
