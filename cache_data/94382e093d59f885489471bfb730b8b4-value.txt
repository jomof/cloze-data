  "writeup": "他に is a nuanced grammar point often challenging for learners.  Let's dissect it.  The word 他 itself means 'another' or 'other.' The particle に directs focus to 'another thing' as the object of the following clause.  The variations are key:他に - 'another thing';他に（も） - 'even another thing' (implies less certainty);他に（は） - 'was there another thing?' (suggests pre-existing knowledge, perhaps something forgotten).  The phrase 他の＋Noun means 'another [specific noun].'  他に（は） can be used in positive or negative sentences, though it leans towards negative contexts.  Crucially, because他に（も） emphasizes the *addition* of something, it's generally unsuitable for negative sentences (except questions).  This exception is due to the implied \"isn't it?\" nuance in Japanese negative questions, similar to English. Consider these examples:  This additional nuance is subtle but crucial for proper usage.  Mastering this will significantly improve your fluency.  The etymology of 他 is interesting, reflecting its original meaning of 'different' or 'separate.'",
