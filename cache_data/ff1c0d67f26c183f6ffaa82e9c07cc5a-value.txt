    "etymology": "までに is a combination of the adverbial particle まで (made), meaning \"until\" or \"as far as\", and the case-marking particle に (ni), which often indicates a target or destination. Therefore, までに literally means \"as far as (a point in time)\" + \"target/destination\", implying a deadline or limit.",
    "writeup": "までに is a combination of two types of particles: the adverbial particle まで and the case-marking particle に. It's similar to まで when it means \"until,\" but there's a crucial difference: までに means \"by\", not \"until.\" To use までに, attach it to the end of a noun (typically indicating time) or a verb in the dictionary form.\n\nThe key is that に usually marks a target or destination. In this case, まで is the \"target\" that に is marking. まで means \"as far as\" (and is sometimes written as 迄, especially in older or formal texts).\n\nSo, までに literally means \"(A) as far as (に marks the target), (B).\" Originally, まで meant \"as far as\" regarding the passing of an event, but now it usually means \"by the beginning of (A).\" Thus, 夏までに could mean either \"by the start of summer\" or \"before the end of summer.\" For clarity, add a more specific timeframe.",
