  "writeup": "The suffix 方 (kata) appended to the masu-stem of a verb indicates the 'way of doing something' or 'how to do something.'  It's essentially 方's standard meaning of 'way' or 'direction' applied to actions.  With する-verbs, you sometimes see the form 仕方 (shikata), which is functionally identical and can be interpreted as 'way of dealing with' or 'way of attending to,' reflecting 仕's original meaning of 'to attend to.'  Note that the する-verb is followed by の and then 仕方.  Interestingly, once 方 is attached, the entire phrase functions as a noun phrase, allowing it to be modified by particles like は, を, etc., to create more complex sentences. This grammatical flexibility adds depth and expressiveness to Japanese.",
  "etymology": "方 (kata) originates from the ancient Chinese character 方, meaning 'square,' 'direction,' or 'method.'  Its evolution into a suffix denoting manner or method reflects the inherent connection between direction and the manner in which something is done.  The addition of 仕 (shi) in 仕方 (shikata) adds a layer of nuance, implying a more deliberate or involved approach to the action.",
