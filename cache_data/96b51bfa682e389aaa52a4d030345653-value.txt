    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を兼ねて」 is derived from the verb 「兼ねる(かねる)」, which means \"to combine,\" \"to hold concurrently,\" or \"to double as.\" The particle 「を」 marks the noun that represents one of the purposes or functions.",
    "writeup": "「を兼ねて」 indicates that an action serves multiple purposes or functions. It is often translated as \"to (A) at the same time as (B),\" \"to double as (A),\" or \"to (A) also partly for the purpose of (B).\" It emphasizes that while one action is taken, it simultaneously achieves another goal or fulfills another role. 「を兼ねて」 often highlights (B) as the primary goal, where (A) is something that acts to support it, makes sense to be done together, or just gives the speaker a good excuse to do (B). In the case of multiple goals existing, the case-marking particle 「と」 will be used for listing of nouns.",
