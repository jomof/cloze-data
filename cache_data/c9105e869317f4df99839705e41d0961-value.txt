    "meaning": "You should, It would be good to",
    "writeup": "「がいい」 combines the case-marking particle 「が」 and the い-adjective 「いい」. It conveys advice, suggestion, or permission, often with an implication of authority. While translated as \"you should\" or \"it would be good to\", it carries a nuance of being a decree from someone in a higher position. Thus, its literal sense is closer to \"doing (A) would be good.\"\n\n「がいい」 often sounds magnanimous or even pompous, especially when the speaker is not in a position of clear authority. Due to this nuance, it is rarely used in everyday conversation.\n\nIn formal contexts, the more literary 「良い」 may replace 「いい」. 「Verb + がいい」 can be seen as a stronger, more authoritative version of 「た方がいい」 \"you should (A)\", implying that the speaker's suggestion is the only correct course of action.\n\nIt is **important** to use this grammar point carefully, as it can easily come across as arrogant or condescending.",
    "etymology": "「がいい」 is derived from the particle 「が」 indicating the subject, combined with the adjective 「いい」 (good), essentially stating that something is good or preferable.",
