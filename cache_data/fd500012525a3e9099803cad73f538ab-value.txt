  "writeup": "までに is a fascinating particle, a combination of まで (made – ‘until,’ ‘as far as’) and に (ni – a particle marking the target or destination of an action).  While similar to まで in indicating a limit, までに crucially signifies a *deadline* or a point *by which* something must be accomplished.  Think of it as the ‘by’ in ‘Please finish by 5pm.’\n\nTo use までに, attach it to the end of a noun or a verb in its plain, non-past form. The nuance shifts subtly depending on the context. A broad timeframe, like 夏までに (natsu made ni - by summer), might be interpreted as ‘by the start of summer’ or ‘before the end of summer,’ highlighting the importance of context for precision.\n\n**Important Considerations:**  The ‘target’ aspect of に is key.  It's not just about the limit; it's about reaching that limit *by* a specific time or event.  The subtlety lies in this distinction between a continuous action ending at a point (まで) and completing something *before* or *at* a point (までに).",
  "etymology": "The particle まで originally indicated a spatial or temporal limit, meaning 'as far as.' The addition of に, which usually denotes a target or destination, shifted the meaning to emphasize the attainment of the limit by a specific time or event. This evolution reflects the dynamism inherent in Japanese grammar, where combining seemingly simple elements creates subtle yet significant shifts in meaning.",
