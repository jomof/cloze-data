    "details": {
        "Register": "Informal, conversational.",
        "Function": "Expresses a hypothetical situation or a statement that is contrary to fact. Often implies futility or lack of effect.",
        "Nuance": "Used to emphasize that something is true despite a contradictory condition or attempt.",
        "Origin": "Contraction of 「と言ったって」 or 「としたって」."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is a contraction of 「と言ったって」 (to itta tte) or 「としたって」 (to shite tte). 「と言う」 (to iu) means \"to say\", and 「とする」 (to suru) means \"to do\" or \"to suppose\". The 「たって」 (tte) part comes from 「とても」 (totemo) implying even if or no matter how much.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「(っ)たって」 is a colloquial expression used to convey \"even if,\" \"even though,\" or \"no matter how much.\" It often carries a nuance of futility or a sense that something will not change despite the condition being stated. This expression is formed by attaching 「(っ)たって」 to the volitional form of a verb, the informal form of a verb, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives/nouns (with or without 「だ/だった」). It's crucial to understand that 「(っ)たって」 is primarily used in casual conversation and can sound abrupt in formal settings. This grammar point implies that regardless of the stated condition, the outcome or situation remains the same. It's frequently used to express disagreement or to downplay the significance of a particular point. Commonly used in casual speech.",

            "conjugation": "volitional",
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "serious",
            "nuance": "「一人でやろうったって」 implies that attempting it alone is futile. The speaker's use of 「だよ」 emphasizes their conviction, making this statement a friendly warning rather than a scolding."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "今から走った**って**、もう間に合わない。",
            "english": "Even if you start running now, you won't make it in time.",
            "conjugation": "past (plain)",
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "pessimistic",
            "nuance": "「走ったって」 emphasizes the futility of running now. The speaker uses informal language 「間に合わない」 to underscore the lateness and hopelessness of the situation."

            "setting": "optimistic",
            "nuance": "「高いったって」 acknowledges the potential high cost but downplays its impact. 「買えないことはない」 conveys a sense of optimism and determination to overcome the financial hurdle.",
            "etymology": "「高い」 is an い-adjective, and it's directly followed by 「ったって」."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "いくら謝った**って**、許さない。",

            "nuance": "「先生だったって」 acknowledges the teacher's position but implies that knowledge has limits. This is a neutral statement aimed at providing perspective rather than criticism.",
            "etymology": "「先生」 is a noun, and the 「だった」 signifies the past tense of 「だ」. 「ったって」 attaches to this form."

            "japanese": "努力した**って**、必ず成功するとは限らない。",

            "etymology": "「綺麗」 is a な-adjective, and it takes 「だった」 to indicate the past tense form."

            "speaker_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "「好きだったって、言えない」 conveys the speaker's internal conflict and inability to express her feelings despite strong emotions, using 「言えない」, which highlights her restrained feelings. The speaker's 「好き」 indicates personal affection, adding an element of yearning to the sentence.",
            "etymology": "「好き」 is a な-adjective, and 「だった」 signifies the past tense of 「だ」. 」ったって」 attaches to this form. The overall meaning is to accept the present state.",

            "nuance": "「デートに間に合わないよ」 conveys a flirty tone, where the male speaker might be late, but the shared anticipation of the date softens the blow. The use of 「急いだって」 is a friendly, teasing apology.",
            "etymology": "The sentence combines the 「急いだって」 structure to express a conditional concession with the playful lament of missing a date, showcasing how the grammar point can soften potentially negative news."

            "etymology": "Here, the volitional form of 「する」 (to do) is used to express intent, and the addition of 「(っ)たって」 suggests that even with the intention to try, the effort is perceived as futile."
