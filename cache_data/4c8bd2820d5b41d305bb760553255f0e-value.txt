  "writeup": "には及ばない (niha oyobanai) is a polite Japanese expression signifying 'there's no need to,' or 'it's unnecessary.'  It's formed by combining the particle に (ni), the topic-marking particle は (wa), and the negative form of the verb 及ぶ (oyob), meaning 'to reach' or 'to extend to.'  Literally, it translates to 'it doesn't extend to (that).' This phrase typically follows nouns or verb stems in their dictionary form.  Because it's polite, the preceding noun often receives an honorific prefix like お (o) or ご (go).  \n\n**Important Considerations:**  While generally polite,  には及ばない can also express a comparison, indicating that one thing 'doesn't reach' or 'cannot compare to' another. This usage translates more like '(A) doesn't measure up to (B).'  Understanding the context is key to determining which meaning applies.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's politeness stems from its use of the negative form of 及ぶ (oyob), a verb often used in more formal contexts. The combination with に and は further enhances its polite and nuanced nature. The structure itself suggests a subtle comparison, reflecting a delicate balance of respect and consideration.",
