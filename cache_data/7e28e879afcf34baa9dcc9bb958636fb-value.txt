    "etymology": "The grammar point 「すくなくない」 is formed by negating the い-adjective 「少ない (すくない)」, meaning \"few\" or \"scarce,\" with the negative ending 「ない」. Thus, 「すくなくない」 literally means \"not few,\" implying a considerable quantity or number.",
    "writeup": "「少なくない」 is formed using the 少 kanji, meaning \"few.\" It's an example of a double negative; since 少ない (sukunai) means \"few,\" negating it results in 「少なくない」, meaning \"not a few,\" or more naturally, \"quite a few\" or \"quite a lot.\"  To use this expression, pair a noun with は, が, or も, followed by 少なくない (or 少なくありません).  Note that the ない in 少ない is part of the word itself, not the い-adjective ない. There are other い-adjectives like this in Japanese; you'll need to memorize them.",
