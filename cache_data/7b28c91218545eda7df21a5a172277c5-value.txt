  "writeup": "ようがない (yō ga nai) and ようもない (yō mo nai) are expressions used to emphasize the impossibility of an action.  They translate to \"There's no way to...\" or \"It's impossible to...\".  Crucially, they differ from the volitional form of verbs. This phrase attaches to the conjunctive (て-form) of verbs.  ようがない often highlights the impossibility of the action, even if the speaker desires it.  **Important:**  The similar-looking よう (yō) is the auxiliary verb that creates the volitional form, so be careful not to confuse them.  This grammar point is used in standard Japanese, across various registers, and is not specific to any particular gender, age group, or region.",
  "etymology": "The structure of ようがない relies on よう (yō), meaning 'way' or 'manner,' combined with the negative form がない (ga nai).  This directly conveys the sense of 'there being no way' to perform the action.  The ようもない variation adds も (mo), intensifying the negation, resulting in a stronger emphasis on impossibility.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "車が壊れているので、修理に行き**ようがない**。",
      "english": "My car is broken, so there's no way I can go to get it repaired.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a straightforward, casual explanation.  The use of 「壊れている」 (koわれている -  broken) and 「行きようがない」 (ikiyō ga nai - there's no way to go) are common and natural in everyday conversation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "試験が難しすぎて、合格しよう**がない**。",
      "english": "The exam was too difficult; there was no way I could pass.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Again, this is casual.  The use of 「難しすぎて」 (muzukashisugite - too difficult) emphasizes the reason for the impossibility. The speaker's feeling of defeat is implicit in the choice of 「合格しようがない」 (gōkaku shiyō ga nai - there's no way I could pass)."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の機嫌を損ねないように、注意深く話そう**としましたが、うまくいきませんでした**。",
      "english": "I tried to speak carefully so as not to offend him, but I couldn't.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「注意深く話そうとしましたが、うまくいきませんでした」 (chūibukaku hanasō to shimashita ga, umaku ikimasendeshita - I tried to speak carefully, but it didn't work) shows a more polite and formal attempt to convey the inability."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "こんな状況では、彼を助ける**術がない**。",
      "english": "In this situation, there's no way to help him.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「術がない」(jutsu ga nai - there is no way), emphasizing the helplessness and lack of options in the current situation. The formality stems from the use of 「こんな状況では」(konna jōkyō de wa - in this situation)."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あのね、君のことが好きすぎて、どうしたらいいのか、わかんないんだよね…どうしようもないんだ…。",
      "english": "You know, I like you so much, I don't know what to do... there's nothing I can do...",
      "register": "shitashii kuchō",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The intimate register comes through in the use of 「あのね」(ano ne - you know), 「わかんない」(wakannai - I don't know), and the repetition and trailing off of the sentence.  The use of 「どうしようもない」 (dōshiyō mo nai - there is nothing I can do) expresses a feeling of helplessness that might be viewed as endearing in a romantic context. The use of 「君」(kimi) further conveys the casual intimacy."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "こんなに素敵なあなたと、もっと話したくてたまらないけど…　今すぐには、話せない**ようなんです**。",
      "english": "I'm dying to talk more with you, you're so wonderful, but... I can't right now.",
      "register": "teineigo",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The polite register is shown in 「素敵なあなた」(suteki na anata - wonderful you) and 「話せないようです」(hanasenai yō desu - I can't speak) showing a softer, more polite rejection.  The use of 「たまらない」(tamaranai - unbearable) conveys longing and intensity, without being overly forward. The female speaker uses the polite form 「んです」(n desu) to soften the rejection."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Note the subtle yet significant differences in nuance between ようがない and ようもない.  While both convey impossibility, ようもない often suggests a stronger, more absolute lack of possibility, sometimes even implying futility.  The choice between them depends on the level of emphasis desired.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "がたい",
      "meaning": "Hard to, Difficult to",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike ようがない, which emphasizes the complete impossibility of an action, がたい suggests difficulty but not necessarily complete impossibility.  There might still be a way, albeit a challenging one."
    },
    {
      "term": "っこない",
      "meaning": "There is no chance of, There is no way of, Impossible",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "っこない is more informal and colloquial than ようがない, often used in casual conversation or among close friends."
    },
    {
      "term": "はずがない",
      "meaning": "Hardly possible, Cannot be, Highly unlikely, Improbable",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "はずがない implies a strong degree of improbability based on logical reasoning or prior knowledge, whereas ようがない simply states the impossibility of an action, regardless of reason."
    },
    {
      "term": "わけがない",
      "meaning": "There is no way, There is no reason, It is impossible, Cannot be",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "わけがない implies the impossibility is due to some illogical or unreasonable aspect.  It emphasizes the lack of logical justification for the action."
    },
    {
      "term": "そうもない",
      "meaning": "Very unlikely to, Does not seem that, Does not appear that",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "そうもない expresses a lower degree of certainty compared to ようがない.  It suggests a possibility, however slim, whereas ようがない implies absolute impossibility."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the underlying reason for the impossibility.  ようがない and ようもない focus on the inherent impossibility of the action itself.  The other expressions suggest difficulty, improbability, or lack of logical justification, but not necessarily complete impossibility."
