    "writeup": "When used at the beginning of a sentence, the adverb 尚 (なお) \"furthermore\" often means \"in addition\", \"furthermore\", \"even more\", or \"moreover\". You'll usually see this after the previous sentence or clause (A) has stated some basic fact or situation, and the second sentence (B) adds to it.  This is especially common when the information in part (B) is somewhat surprising or unexpected.  It's worth noting that 「なお」 in this usage is almost always written in hiragana. Because 「なお」 is a formal grammar point, it appears frequently in written materials like letters, posters, and commercials.\n\n**Important Consideration:**  Think of 「なお」 as signaling that despite what was said before (A), this additional point (B) is also true.  This can be about good things or bad things, but it emphasizes that (B) might not be the most obvious or expected consequence given (A).",
