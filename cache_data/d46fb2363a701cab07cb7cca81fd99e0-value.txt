  "writeup": "かろう is an archaic grammatical pattern derived from the stem of the い-adjective かろ and the auxiliary verb う.  It's essentially an older, more literary equivalent to the modern だろう or でしょう, expressing probability or conjecture.  Think of it as a 'probably' or 'likely' marker.  In modern Japanese, it's exceedingly rare, relegated almost exclusively to older media like classic literature, dramas, and some anime, often used by elderly or authoritative characters. To use it, replace the final い of an い-adjective with かろう.  The negative form, using ない, is also possible, and conjugates similarly. However, even in period pieces, this conjugation is uncommon outside very specific contexts.",

  "etymology": "The かろう ending comes from the contraction of the adjective かろ (an archaic form related to いい) and the auxiliary verb う. This structure reflects a grammatical pattern from a significantly earlier stage of Japanese language development."
