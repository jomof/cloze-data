  "writeup": "ずに済む (ずにすむ) is a useful Japanese grammar construction expressing relief at avoiding an undesirable action.  It literally translates to something like 'to manage without doing,' but conveys a sense of fortunate avoidance.  This phrase cleverly combines ず (zu), a literary auxiliary verb indicating negation similar to ない (nai), with the verb 済む (sumu), meaning 'to be finished,' 'to end,' or 'to suffice.'  The nuance is one of relief; the speaker is glad they could avoid the action. The ず part attaches to the verb stem in the same way as ない.  Because 済む (sumu) is the key element determining the meaning, you might also see variations such as なくて済む (nakute sumu) or 無しで済む (nashi de sumu).  While ないで (naide) and ずに (zuni) function similarly, 無しで (nashi de) works directly with nouns.  The action typically avoided is something unpleasant or burdensome, making the speaker's relief all the more apparent.",
  "etymology": "The etymology lies in the combination of the negative form marker ず (zu), derived from the negative form of する (suru, to do), and the verb 済む (sumu), which originally meant 'to finish' or 'to come to an end'. The combination expresses the successful completion of a task or situation *without* performing a particular action. The sense of relief stems from the implication that the avoided action was undesirable or difficult.",
