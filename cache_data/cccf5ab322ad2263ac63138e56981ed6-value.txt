    "etymology": "兼 (kaneru) means \"to combine\" or \"to do two things at once.\" In this grammatical construction, it takes on the nuance of something being beyond one's ability or capacity; the action is \"too much\" to handle, like trying to do two incompatible things simultaneously.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「かねる」, typically written in kana, expresses the idea that someone cannot do something, finds it difficult to do something, or is hesitant to do something. Though 「兼ねる」 itself means \"to combine\" or \"do two things at once,\" the 「〜かねる」construction indicates that doing the action is not possible due to external circumstances, difficulty, or reluctance.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Formality:** 「かねる」is more formal than 「できない」, and it's often used when the speaker wants to soften the refusal.\n*   **Transitive Verbs:** It's usually used with transitive verbs (verbs that take a direct object), with the exception of 「わかる」and 「できる」.\n*   **Nuance of Desire:** It often implies that the speaker *wants* to do the action but cannot.",
