  "writeup": "The grammar point \"ことができる\" (koto ga dekiru) means \"can\" or \"to be able to.\"  It's formed by combining こと (koto, 'thing') + が (ga, subject marker) + できる (dekiru, 'to be able').  The こと acts as a nominalizer, turning the preceding verb or adjective into a noun phrase.  This construction is versatile and commonly used in various contexts.  While できる itself is a potential form indicating ability, こと が できる adds a layer of emphasis or makes the ability more explicit.  Note that when the preceding element is already a noun, the こと is often omitted, resulting in ～ができる (～ga dekiru). For example,  \"運転ができる\" (unten ga dekiru) means \"can drive.\" This is a highly versatile and common grammar point, used across genders and ages, without regional variations.",
  "etymology": "The core of this grammar point,  できる (dekiru), is derived from the verb できる (dekiru), meaning 'to be done,' 'to be completed,' or 'to be possible.' The addition of こと (koto), meaning 'thing' or 'matter,' serves to transform the verb into a nominalized form, which makes the ability more explicit.",

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「すごいね！」(Sugoi ne!), a casual expression showing support and approval. The casual 「できる」 (dekiru) and the compliment shows an older speaker's admiration for a younger listener's ability."

    {
      "japanese": "あのね、実は私、あなたに料理を作ってあげ**ることができる**の。",

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「あのね」(Ano ne) and 「実は」(Jitsu wa) soften the directness of the confession, creating a flirtatious and intimate atmosphere.  The sentence is framed in a way that only a female speaker would likely say, using the phrase 「作ってあげることができる」(tsukutte age ru koto ga dekiru) which is a more feminine and gentle way of expressing ability."

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The sentence is encouraging, using the informal 「できる」(dekiru),  and the encouraging phrase 「君なら何でも」(Kimi nara nan demo), which shows a supportive interaction between an older and younger person. The use of 「きっと」(kitto) adds confidence to the encouragement."
    },
        {
      "japanese": "あなたと、もっと時間を共有**することができたら**、嬉しいな。",
      "english": "I'd be happy if I could spend more time with you.",

      "conjugation": "conditional (tara-form)",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「できたら」(dekitara) expresses a wish or hope, which is more subtle and less demanding than a direct statement of ability. The sentence conveys a delicate sentiment appropriate for a first encounter, and the use of 「嬉しいな」(Ureshii na) softens the overall tone."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the choice between  ことができる and できる depends on whether nominalization is needed.  If the preceding element is already a noun,  ～ができる is sufficient and more natural. Pay attention to the context and the level of formality needed when choosing the conjugation.",

      "nuance": "Unlike こと が できる, which emphasizes the possibility of action, れる/られる indicates inherent ability or potential.  こと が できる is more versatile and frequently used in everyday conversation."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The potential forms れる/られる  (reru/rareru) and  こと が できる  often overlap in meaning but have subtle differences in usage.  れる/られる often implies an inherent ability, a capability built into the subject.  こと が できる, on the other hand, focuses more on the act of being able to do something in a particular circumstance. Consider the nuance when selecting the most appropriate phrase."
