  "writeup": "The auxiliary verb \"まい\" is used in Japanese to express negative volition.  This means it's, in many ways, the opposite of \"う\" and \"よう,\" which express positive volition.  \"まい\" attaches to the base form of verbs and is considered slightly formal.  \"まい\" may be translated as 'won't (do A)', 'to intend not to (do A)', or 'probably not (do A)'. It can be seen as a more concise way of expressing ～ないだろう.  Important Consideration: When used with する or くる, it's also common to see \"まい\" connected to the conjunctive forms しまい, すまい, きまい, and こまい. However, the standard するまい and くるまい are also quite common.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of \"まい\" is complex and not definitively settled. However, it's generally understood to be related to the negative form of the verb, reflecting its function in expressing negative intent or probability.  Its connection to the more informal  ～ないだろう suggests a historical evolution from a more emphatic negation towards a more nuanced expression of doubt or unwillingness.",
