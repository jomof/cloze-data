    "etymology": "Etymologically, 「ので」 is derived from the te-form of 「のだ」. While it originated from 「のだ」, in modern Japanese, it functions solely as a conjunctive particle to indicate reason or cause.",
    "writeup": "「ので」 is a conjunctive particle used to connect two parts of a sentence, indicating a logical connection similar to 「から」, often translated as \"because,\" \"since,\" or \"so.\"  When connecting to na-adjectives or nouns, 「な」 must precede 「ので」. It emphasizes the sentence as a whole or the effects caused, examining reasons objectively. 「から」 tends to be more subjective. 「ので」 can sometimes appear as 「んで」, a more casual variant. Unlike many verb-connecting grammar points, 「ので」 can follow the ます-form. It's versatile and widely used in everyday speech and writing. You will encounter 「ので」 in a variety of formal and informal settings.",

Pay attention to the context and the relationship between speakers to make the most appropriate choice."
