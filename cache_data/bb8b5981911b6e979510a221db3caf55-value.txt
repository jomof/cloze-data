    "etymology": "The verb 「もらう」 originally meant \"to receive an increase\" or \"to gain something.\" It evolved from the verb 「取る」 (toru, to take) with the addition of the honorific prefix 「も」. Over time, its meaning narrowed to specifically receiving something from someone else.",
    "writeup": "「もらう」 is a verb meaning \"to receive,\" \"to get,\" or \"to obtain.\" It's often taught alongside 「くれる」 and 「あげる」 to illustrate the dynamics of giving and receiving in Japanese. \n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n*   Unlike 「くれる」 and 「あげる」, which focus on the act of *giving*, 「もらう」 focuses on the act of *receiving*.\n*   「に」 or 「から」 particles mark the *giver*, not the recipient. The recipient is marked by 「が」 or 「は」.\n*   The object being given is marked by 「を」.\n\nThe giver or receiver can be omitted if the context is clear. Sometimes both are, if the item being received is the clear focus.",
