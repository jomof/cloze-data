    "etymology": "「間に」 is a noun meaning \"interval\" or \"space.\" The 「に」 particle marks the location or time in which something occurs.",
    "writeup": "「の間に」 (no aida ni) expresses that an action or event (B) occurs within a specific timeframe or space (A). It indicates \"while,\" \"during,\" or \"between.\" When used with verbs or い-adjectives, 「の間に」 directly follows. Nouns require 「の」 (e.g., 「夏休みの間に」 - during summer vacation), and な-adjectives require 「な」 (e.g., 「静かな間に」 - while it is quiet). When expressing the period \"until\" something happens, it's often paired with 「まで」 (made). The action/location (B) typically happens at a specific point during (A) and doesn't fill the entire duration of (A).",
