  "writeup": "にせよ and にしろ are two phrases often translated as 'even if (A)' or 'no matter if (A),' but their nuance is more forceful.  They combine に with the imperative forms of する: せよ (more written) and しろ (more spoken).  Instead of a simple conditional, they convey a sense of the speaker asserting that condition (A) is ultimately irrelevant to their main point.  Think of it as \"so it's (A), who cares!\"  This construction follows verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns in their standard forms. Because of its directness, it emphasizes that regardless of (A), (B) remains true or is the crucial consideration.",
