  "writeup": "The auxiliary verb そうだ has two primary functions in Japanese.  It can convey hearsay—information the speaker heard from others—or an appearance, indicating how things seem. This lesson focuses on hearsay.  When used to repeat heard statements, そうだ (or そうです) is paired with the plain form of a verb or い-adjective, or a noun/な-adjective followed by だ.  It always implies uncertainty; the speaker isn't 100% sure of the information's validity, making it less confident than expressions like ようだ.  Important Considerations:  To avoid confusion with the そうだ used for observations, memorize these differences: Verbs (降るそうだ vs 降りそうだ), い-adjectives (寒いそうだ vs 寒そうだ), and nouns/な-adjectives (綺麗だそうだ vs 綺麗そうだ). The difference lies in whether the verb/adjective is in its plain form or a conjunctive/modified form.",
  "etymology": "そうだ originates from the combination of そう (sou - seemingly, apparently) and だ (da - a copula indicating the state of being). The  そう element carries the sense of indirect information or appearance, while だ marks the assertion.  The structure's flexibility allows for a variety of nuanced expressions of hearsay.",

      "listener_gender": "female",

      "nuance": "Using 「だそうです」 in 「あの人は、金持ちで、すごく優しい人だそうです」with an older listener softens the tone even in a casual setting; showing respect. The speaker is a younger person but the listener is older.  The 「そうです」 is used for polite-casual interaction with a respectful overtone."

      "nuance": "The use of 「って」and 「よ」 in 「あのレストランは予約しないと入れないそうだって、友達が言ってたよ」 along with the plain form 「そうだ」 makes this a friendly, casual interaction between friends; the female speaker talking to the male listener. The sentence structure is typical of everyday casual speech among young people."
