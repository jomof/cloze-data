  "writeup": "The particle まみれ, primarily seen in hiragana, indicates being 'completely covered in (A)', 'smeared all over with (A)', or 'stained with (A)'.  It follows nouns and can appear as まみれの when directly modifying a second noun.  Importantly, まみれ usually describes something negative or negatively perceived, even if not physically so, like debt or overwhelming desires.  Think blood, mud, oil—things you'd rather not be covered in. A fun fact: まみれ is the noun form of the verb 塗れる, related to 塗る ('to paint').  Like 'to paint', まみれる and まみれ describe something covering the outer surface, not the contents.",
  "etymology": "まみれ comes from the verb 塗れる (nureru), meaning \"to be stained\" or \"to be covered\".  This verb itself originates from the verb 塗る (nuru), meaning \"to paint\" or \"to apply a coating\". The noun form まみれ retains the sense of being covered or stained, but with a stronger connotation of being completely and perhaps messily covered.",
