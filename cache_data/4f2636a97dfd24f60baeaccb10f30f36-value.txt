  "writeup": "The phrase \"のはXの方だ\" (no wa X no hō da) is a nuanced expression used to highlight a specific actor or cause, often in a context of contrast or unexpected responsibility.  It translates roughly to \"It's X who/that...\" or \"The one who/that... is X.\"  The structure combines the nominalizer \"の\" (no), the topic marker \"は\" (wa), emphasizing contrast, the possessive particle \"の\" (no), the noun \"方\" (hō) meaning 'side' or 'direction,' and the copula \"だ\" (da).  The 'side' aspect softens the directness of a simple assertion, often conveying a sense of apologetic explanation or a subtle shift of blame.  This construction is generally versatile and not limited to any specific gender, age group, or region.  Using \"なのは\" (nano wa) instead of \"のは\" (no wa) is required when the preceding word is a noun.",
  "etymology": "The core of this phrase lies in the word 方 (hō), originally indicating direction or side.  Its use here adds a layer of indirectness and softens the directness of assigning responsibility, creating a more nuanced and less confrontational tone compared to a simple subject-verb structure. The combination with の (possessive particle) and は (topic marker) further enhances this contextualization of responsibility.",
