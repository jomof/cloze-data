  "writeup": "The adverb もう (mou) is a versatile particle with nuances often missed by beginning learners.  Its core meaning hinges on the unexpected conclusion of an event or state.  This is why it translates to both 'already' (in past-positive contexts) and 'anymore' (in negative contexts).  In short, it indicates a shift or change from an expected state.  Think of it as marking the point where something previously anticipated—either happening or *not* happening—suddenly concludes unexpectedly.  This explains its double-duty in English translation.  It's crucial to consider the context: is the action/state completed earlier than expected ('already')? Or has it stopped when expected to continue ('anymore')?  Moreover, もう can also convey a sense of resignation or exasperation, such as \"I give up!\" or \"That's enough!\"\n\nImportant Considerations:\n* **Context is key:**  The meaning of もう is entirely dependent on the surrounding sentence and its tense.  This adverb acts as a subtle signal of a completed or concluded event, whether it's positive (already done) or negative (not done anymore).\n* **Exasperation:**  Don't underestimate its use to express frustration or the termination of a state. This is sometimes more common than its literal meaning.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of もう is fascinating. It's derived from the older form,  もう (mou), which is related to the verb  終える (oeru) meaning \"to finish\" or \"to end.\"",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The difference between もう and まだ lies in their indication of expectation. もう signals an unexpected end, while まだ points to an unexpected continuation.  すでに, though similar to もう, carries a more formal tone and emphasizes a planned completion rather than the unexpected one.  Choosing the correct word depends entirely on whether you're highlighting the unexpected completion or continuation of an event or state."
