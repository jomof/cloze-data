  "writeup": "The particle に, as we've explored in previous lessons, indicates the target or recipient of an action.  However, when combined with 当たる (ataru), meaning 'to hit' or 'to strike,' it takes on a more nuanced meaning.  に当たる functions to express correspondence, equivalence, or appropriateness. It indicates that something is equivalent to or represents something else. Think of it as establishing a relationship of semantic similarity or functional equivalence between two elements.  The structure is generally [Noun A] に当たる [Noun B], where Noun B is explained or defined by Noun A.  The crucial distinction here is that this isn't about a direct causal relationship, but rather a parallel or equivalence.  This makes it subtly different from similar expressions, a point we'll delve into later.",
  "etymology": "当たる (ataru) itself originates from the concept of 'hitting' or 'striking' a target.  In the context of に当たる, the 'hitting' metaphor is extended to signify an accurate match or correspondence—a hit in terms of meaning or equivalence. This metaphorical extension is a testament to the elegance and suggestive nature of Japanese word formation.",
