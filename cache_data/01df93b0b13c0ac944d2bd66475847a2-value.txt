    "writeup": "「から」 is a particle in Japanese with several meanings, but its most basic function is to indicate a starting point, origin, or source. It's often translated as \"from.\" It follows the noun, pronoun, or place that serves as the origin. The nuance of 「から」 can almost always be thought of as meaning 'from' in some way.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「から」 and 「てから」 involve the concept of time, it's important to remember that 「から」 marks a starting point, while 「てから」 indicates the sequence of actions. For example, 「家から学校へ行く」 (I go to school from home) uses 「から」 to show the starting point of the action. In contrast, 「ご飯を食べてから出かける」 (I will go out after eating) uses 「てから」 to indicate that eating precedes going out."
