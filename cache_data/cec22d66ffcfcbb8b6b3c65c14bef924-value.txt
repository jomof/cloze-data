    "writeup": "ども (domo) is a conjunction that expresses concession, similar to \"even though\" or \"although\" in English. It's often used to indicate that despite a certain condition or action, a particular result or situation still occurs. It can also express \"no matter how much/often/hard.\" Its usage is primarily confined to formal writing and speech. It carries a more literary or stiff nuance than alternatives like 「～ても」.  The most common pattern involves using the 連用形 (ren'yōkei, continuative form) of a verb, but conditional forms are also used in set phrases.",

    "etymology": "The origin of 「ども」 is debated, with some theories suggesting it evolved from the 連体形 (rentaikei, attributive form) of the auxiliary verb 「ど」, indicating a state of being, combined with the conjunction 「も」 (mo, also/even).  Another theory proposes a connection to the verb 「止む」 (yamu, to stop), implying a sense of something continuing despite a reason for it to stop.",
