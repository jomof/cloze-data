    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ている」 combines the te-form 「て」 of a verb with the verb 「いる」, which means 'to exist' or 'to be'. The te-form indicates a prior action or state, and 「いる」 indicates that this state is ongoing or continuing. Together, they describe a situation resulting from a completed action that persists into the present.",
    "writeup": "The 「ている」 form, as previously discussed, conveys that something exists in a constant state of 'doing' the verb. This lesson focuses on verbs that express 'existing in a state of (A) having been done.' In English, this often translates to the past form, such as 'started,' 'come,' or 'died.' However, Japanese views these as ongoing states. Once something is angry, it 'exists in the state of being angry'; once something has started, it 'exists in the state of being ongoing'; once something dies, it 'exists in the state of being dead,' and so on.\n\n**Important Note:**\n\nOne way to distinguish whether to use the 「ている」 form or the past form is to consider if the action can be repeated. Something generally cannot 'start' or 'die' twice, so the 「ている」 form is used. This is a helpful guideline for most verbs using this form.",
