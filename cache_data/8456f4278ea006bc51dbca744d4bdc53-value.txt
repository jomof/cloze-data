  "writeup": "ことだから is a set expression in Japanese used to indicate the speaker's strong certainty about a consequence (B) based on their prior knowledge or experience with a cause (A).  It's often translated as \"It is exactly because (A) that (B)\" or \"Precisely because it is (A), (B).\"  The structure combines the noun こと (koto, 'thing'), だ (da, a copula), and から (kara, 'because').  Think of it as implying: 'From the fact that it's (A), it follows that (B)'.  This construction emphasizes the inevitability of (B) given the established fact of (A).  It frequently follows verbs in their dictionary form or nouns followed by の (no).  However, it can also follow verbs in other standard forms when (A) is seen as a favorable condition for (B), or simply to emphasize that (A) is the undeniable reason for (B). While these nuances exist, the intended meaning is usually clear from the context of (B). Therefore, you can generally think of ことだから as meaning 'By the logic of (A), definitely (B).'",
  "etymology": "こと (koto) originates from the verb する (suru, 'to do'), and originally referred to an action or event.  だ (da) is a copula, meaning 'is' or 'am', acting as a linking verb. から (kara) indicates cause and reason, literally meaning 'from'.  The combination of these elements creates a strong causal implication.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "あの人が**することだから**、どうせ人を騙して儲けているに違いない。",
      "english": "Precisely because it is something that person does, there is no doubt that he is making money scamming people.",
      "register": "standard",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「することだから」 to express a strong inference based on the speaker's knowledge of the person's past behavior.  The phrase is appropriate for expressing certainty in a standard register and setting. No specific gender is implied."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "いつも遅れてくる田中くんのことだから、今日も**遅れてくるだろう**。",
      "english": "It is exactly because Tanaka-kun always arrives late, that he will probably arrive late today.",
      "register": "standard",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This example uses the plain future form 「遅れてくるだろう」to present a prediction based on Tanaka-kun's habitual tardiness.  The overall tone remains casual yet informative, relying on the certainty provided by ことだから."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "お父さんとお母さんが珍しくうちに来ている**ことだから**、久しぶりにみんなで映画でも見よう。",
      "english": "Dad, mom, considering that you guys are here, which is a rare occasion, why don't we watch a movie together for the first time in a while?",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "intimate",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The speaker uses polite language 「お父さんとお母さん」 and the suggestion 「映画でも見よう」 to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.  The use of ことだから softens the suggestion, making it seem natural given the parents' unusual visit. The sentence is suitable for family members."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "撮影が無事終わった**ことだから**、打ち上げでもしましょう！",
      "english": "Considering that we have finished filming, let's have a party!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "excited",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual exclamation 「しましょう！」 and the celebratory suggestion 「打ち上げ」 fit the celebratory mood.  ことだから is used to create a causal link, suggesting that the party is a natural consequence of the successful filming."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたのことだから、間違いなくうまくいくと**思う**よ。",
      "english": "It's you, so I think it will definitely go well.",

      "setting": "supportive",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual phrase 「思うよ」 and the encouraging tone convey the speaker's confidence in the listener's abilities.  ことだから provides the causal link, implying the listener's past successes as the reason for the speaker's confidence.  The 「よ」 particle is suitable for a close relationship."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "そういうことだから、一人でそういうところには行かない**方がいい**。",
      "english": "That's why, it's better not to go to such a place alone.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "cautious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The semi-formal advice 「方がいい」 offers a suggestion, rather than a forceful command, which is appropriate for a situation where safety concerns are raised. ことだから implies that the speaker's advice is a logical consequence of the earlier statement, making the warning more convincing. The phrase is gender-neutral."

    {
      "japanese": "部長のことだから、またミスをしたらクビにさせられると**思う**。",

      "setting": "pessimistic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The speaker expresses anxiety using 「思う」 in a casual register.  The use of ことだから explains the source of anxiety, indicating the speaker's knowledge of the boss's strict nature. The phrase is gender-neutral."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how ことだから subtly shifts the nuance depending on the verb conjugation and overall sentence structure.  The core meaning remains consistent, but the level of certainty and the implied suggestion can change.  The contextual clues surrounding ことだから help define the subtleties of its usage.",

    {
      "term": "ものだから",
      "meaning": "Because, The reason is",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike ことだから, which emphasizes the speaker's certainty based on specific knowledge, ものだから is a more general causal explanation, not necessarily implying a degree of certainty."

      "meaning": "Because, The reason is, That is because",

      "meaning": "From the fact that",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "ことから indicates the starting point of a causal chain, often leaving the conclusion more open-ended, whereas ことだから strongly implies a specific conclusion."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these phrases share a similar function of expressing causality, their nuances differ.  Choosing the right phrase depends on the degree of certainty, formality, and the intended emphasis.  Consider the strength of the causal link and the level of formality required when deciding which phrase to use.  ことだから is particularly useful for situations where the speaker's confidence is based on prior experience and implies a high degree of certainty about the conclusion."
