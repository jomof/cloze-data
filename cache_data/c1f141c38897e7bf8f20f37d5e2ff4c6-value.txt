    "writeup": "The grammar point 「一切〜ない」 expresses a complete negation or lack of something. It means \"not at all,\" \"absolutely not,\" or \"not whatsoever.\" It's stronger than 「全然〜ない」 or 「全く〜ない」. Often seen in formal writing and speech, it adds emphasis to the negation. For instance, 「一切食べない」 means someone doesn't eat something at all. As the sentence structure indicates, the verb is usually in the negative form.",
    "etymology": "「一切」 originally comes from Buddhist terminology, meaning 'everything' or 'all.' When used with 「ない」, it negates everything related to the preceding noun or verb, creating a strong sense of complete absence.",
