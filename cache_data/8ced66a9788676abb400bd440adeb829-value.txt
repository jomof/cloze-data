    "writeup": "如何 (ikan) is an adverbial expression, functioning to ask \"how?\" or indicating that something depends on a certain condition or manner. It's more formal than the more common expression, どう (dou), and is often found in formal writing and speech. The phrase 「如何だ」 (ikan da) is used to inquire directly about the state or condition of something, while 「～の如何」 (～ no ikan) indicates that a result or situation depends on the preceding noun. It's frequently seen with phrases like 「～如何で」 (～ikan de) or 「～如何によっては」 (～ikan ni yotte wa), meaning \"depending on ~.\" Note that it can be used with 「～如何に関わらず」 (～ikan ni kakawarazu) to mean \"regardless of ~.\"",
