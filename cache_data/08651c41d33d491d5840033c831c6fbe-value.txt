  "etymology": "命令形 (meirei-kei) literally translates to 'command form'.  The term 'kei' (形) means 'form' or 'shape,' a common suffix in Japanese grammar to denote verb conjugations.  'Meirei' (命令) means 'command' or 'order,' clearly indicating the function of this verb form.",
  "writeup": "The Japanese imperative form (命令形, meirei-kei) directly expresses commands or instructions.  It's the most blunt way to give an order and, as such, is **generally avoided in everyday conversation** unless the context warrants its directness, such as in emergency situations or with close friends where a casual tone is appropriate.  While grammatically simple, its potential for rudeness makes it important to consider the relationship between speaker and listener before employing this form.  \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n* **Register:**  This form is highly informal.  Avoid it with superiors or strangers.\n* **Gender:** While grammatically neutral, men use the plain imperative more frequently than women, who tend toward softer alternatives like the te-form. \n* **Alternatives:**  Polite alternatives exist, such as the polite imperative (～てください) or softer phrasing. \n\nMastering the nuances of giving commands in Japanese is crucial, and this form highlights the importance of choosing appropriate expressions based on context and relationship.",

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「来い」(koi) is very direct and harsh; only appropriate in urgent situations. This is a male-dominated form. The speaker's anger is palpable."

      "japanese": "ドアを**閉めて**ください。",
      "english": "Please close the door.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": "polite imperative",
      "nuance": "「閉めてください」(shimetekudasai) is a polite and respectful way to give instructions, suitable for most social situations."

    {
      "japanese": "ちょっと**待って**よ。",
      "english": "Wait a second.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": "plain imperative (yo)",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "Adding 「よ」(yo) softens the command slightly, making it more suitable for close friends.  The speaker is female, and using 「よ」is typical in informal female speech. 「待って」(matte) is a common form for this, and could be considered a te-form.  It's used for close friends, but still conveys a command."

      "conjugation": "polite imperative",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "While grammatically an imperative, 「飲んで」(nonde)  in this flirty context isn't a forceful order but a suggestive invitation.  The particle 「みない？」(minai?) softens the imperative and adds a playful tone. The speaker is male; using the polite imperative is a common way for a male to flirt."
