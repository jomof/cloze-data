  "etymology": "何より (naniyori) is a compound phrase.  '何' (nani) means 'what' or 'something,' while 'より' (yori) means 'than.'  Therefore, the literal meaning leans towards 'more than anything else.'  The evolution of its usage, however, emphasizes the feeling of relief or gladness that something positive has occurred, especially when a negative outcome was possible.",
  "writeup": "何より (naniyori), sometimes emphasized as 何よりも (naniyori mo), is a crucial phrase expressing relief, gladness, or prioritization.  It translates most naturally as \"above all else,\" \"more than anything,\" or \"best of all.\"  Its use implies a sense of positive outcome, often contrasting with a potentially negative situation.  For example, if something could have gone wrong but didn't, 何より expresses that relief.  It typically functions adverbially, appearing at the sentence's beginning or before the element it modifies.  Occasionally, it precedes a noun followed by の (no).  The addition of も (mo) simply intensifies the phrase.",
