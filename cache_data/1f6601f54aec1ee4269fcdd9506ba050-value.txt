  "writeup": "The polite verb てもらう means \"to have someone do something for you.\"  It's a crucial grammar point for expressing requests and situations where you receive a service. Unlike てくれる, which emphasizes the kindness of the giver, てもらう focuses on the act of receiving the action.  The particle に marks the person performing the action, while が (or は) highlights the person receiving the action.  \"To have (someone) do (something) for you\" or \"to get (someone) to do (something) for you\" are common English translations. It's often used when receiving services, highlighting the transaction more directly than the inherent helpfulness.  The nuance shifts subtly depending on context.  Mastering this will significantly elevate your politeness in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The verb てもらう is formed from the verb もらう (morau, to receive) and the て-form of a verb.  The て-form acts as a nominalizer, transforming the preceding verb into a noun that represents the action itself, which is then \"received\" by the subject. This illustrates how Japanese often expresses actions indirectly.",

      "english": "I intend to have him cook dinner.",

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of \"彼に\" (kare ni) to refer to the boyfriend is natural in a conversation between female friends, and using the dictionary form adds an intimacy because it is not explicit about the future action."

      "japanese": "この難しい問題を先生に**説明してもらった**。",

      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The use of  \"あのね\" (ano ne) and the te-form of てもらう makes it sound very casual and approachable for younger speakers, between close friends."

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "Using polite past tense implies a past action with a slight playful implication, and the subject being 'her' makes it a flirty sentence. \"彼女に\" (kanojo ni) is a natural way for a male to refer to his girlfriend casually when talking to his friends."

      "conjugation": "polite non-past",
      "nuance": "The use of  \"もし時間があれば\" (moshi jikan ga areba) and the polite non-past of てもらう makes it sound polite and a proper request in a professional setting."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the nuance of てもらう changes with tense and context.  In casual settings, shorter forms are common.  Formal settings generally call for the polite forms.  Remember to consider your relationship with the listener and the overall atmosphere when choosing the appropriate conjugation.",

      "meaning": "To do something for someone (usually the speaker)",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in perspective.  てもらう focuses on *your* reception of the action, while てくれる emphasizes the *other person's* kindness.  もらう is simply receiving something, without the implication of another person's action. Consider the relationship between speaker and listener and what you want to emphasize when choosing between these expressions."
