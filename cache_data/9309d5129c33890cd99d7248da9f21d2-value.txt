    "etymology": "「た」is the past form of a verb. 「こと」 is a noun meaning 'thing' or 'event'. 「が」 is a particle marking the subject. 「ある」 means 'to exist' or 'to have'. So, literally, it means 'There is the thing of having done'.",
    "writeup": "「たことがある」 is a Japanese grammar point used to express that someone has had the experience of doing something. It combines the past tense form of a verb (た-form) with 「ことがある」 (koto ga aru), literally meaning \"there is a thing of having done.\" This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts to share past experiences or inquire about others' experiences. The negative form 「たことがない」 (ta koto ga nai) is used to express that someone has never had the experience of doing something.",
