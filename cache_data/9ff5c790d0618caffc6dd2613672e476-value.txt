  "writeup": "に反して, meaning \"contrary to\" or \"in contrast to,\" is a formal grammatical construction combining the particle に and the て-form of 反する (hansuru), meaning \"to oppose\" or \"to go against.\"  It's used to introduce a contrasting point or counter-argument following a previous statement.  Think of it as a more formal and nuanced version of other contrastive expressions.  The structure is typically: [Noun/Clause] に反して, [Contrasting Statement]. This construction often highlights a discrepancy between expectation and reality.  Its formal nature means it's predominantly found in formal writing such as academic papers, official documents, and formal speeches, not everyday conversation.",
  "etymology": "The construction's formality stems directly from its base, 反する (hansuru).  The verb 反する itself is composed of 反 (han), meaning \"reverse,\" \"opposite,\" or \"against,\" and する (suru), a common auxiliary verb.  The て-form addition emphasizes the action of going against something. The particle に marks the target of this opposition.",
