    "etymology": "The term 「う-verb」 refers to the fact that the verb ends in 「う」 sound. They are also called 「五段動詞」(ごだんどうし), or 'Godan verbs,' which refers to the fact that these verbs conjugate across five rows in the Japanese syllabary (the five vowels: a, i, u, e, o).",
    "writeup": "う-Verbs are verbs in Japanese that end in う sounds (including some verbs ending in る). They're called Godan (五段) or \"five-level\" verbs because their conjugations use all five vowel sounds in the same column (段) of the kana chart as their base form.  For example, the 「く」 in 「聞く」 (to listen) changes to 「き」 when conjugated to the polite form 「聞きます」. All other sounds in the K-column will be used with 「聞く」 depending on the conjugation: 「聞かない」, 「聞きたい」, 「聞く」, 「聞ける」, 「聞こう」.\n\nJust like with る-Verbs, the base form of the verb may be called \"plain form\", \"casual form\", or \"short form\", depending on the source.",
