  "writeup": "The phrase \"とても～ない\" expresses a strong sense of impossibility or negation.  It's crucial to understand that \"とても\" (totemo, very much) intensifies the negation conveyed by \"～ない\" (-nai, not). This construction isn't merely a stronger version of a simple negation; it emphasizes the absolute impossibility or complete lack of something.  While it often appears with potential verb forms (verbs indicating ability or possibility),  the crucial element is the speaker's perceived impossibility, not necessarily the grammatical form of the verb itself.  This nuance is key to mastering its usage.  Let's delve into its nuances and subtleties with examples.",
  "etymology": "とても (totemo) originates from とてもに (totemoni), an adverbial phrase intensifying the following word.  The に (ni) particle eventually dropped out of common usage, leaving the concise とても.  The combination with the negative verb form ない (-nai) creates this emphatic negation.",

      "conjugation": "dictionary form (plain non-past)",

      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": "past (polite)",
      "nuance": "The polite past tense 「とても解決できません」 (totemo kaiketsu dekimasen deshita) is used in a formal setting, to demonstrate respect or politeness.  The past tense emphasizes that the impossibility was relevant to the past."

    {
      "japanese": "彼の態度は**とても許せない**。",

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「とても忘れられない」 (totemo wasurerarenai desu) is used in a flirty context, where the speaker expresses strong feelings in a respectful manner. The use of です (desu) adds politeness."

      "english": "I'm truly very sorry for contacting you so late.",

      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": "past (polite)",
      "nuance": "This example shows a humble form of apology. The emphasis on \"truly\" is similar to the effect of  \"とても\" (totemo) despite using a different expression.  The humble language shows respect for the listener."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the intensity of \"とても\" (totemo) affects the overall meaning.  While the potential form is common, it's the emotional weight of the speaker's assessment of impossibility that truly defines this grammar point. The context is crucial.",

      "meaning": "Not ~ at all",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "全く～ない (mattaku -nai) is a stronger negation than simple ～ない (-nai), but lacks the specific nuance of impossibility conveyed by とても～ない (totemo -nai)."

      "term": "すこしも～ない",
      "meaning": "Not even a little, Not at all, Not in the least, Never",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "すこしも～ない (sukoshi mo -nai) indicates a complete absence, similar to ぜんぜん, but again, lacks the inherent impossibility associated with とても～ない (totemo -nai)."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the implied impossibility.  とても～ない emphasizes the speaker's perception of something being completely unachievable or unbelievable.  The other phrases simply denote a complete absence or negation without the same level of impossibility."
