    "writeup": "The grammar point **をもって** (motte) signifies a formal declaration of a time limit or a concluding point.  It translates to \"as of,\" \"with,\" or \"effective from\" when used with time expressions.  Think of it as drawing a line in the sand at a specific time or event.  It's often found in official announcements, formal speeches, and written documents.\n\nをもって is a combination of the particle **を** and **もって**, which itself means \"by means of.\"  When used with a time-related noun, it indicates that something concludes or becomes effective at that point in time.  A more polite variation, often heard in formal settings, is **をもちまして** (o mochima shite).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   をもって emphasizes the **end** point or the **effective date**.  It's not typically used to indicate the start of something unless there's a clear implication of the preceding period ending.\n*   While \"effective from\" can sometimes imply a starting point in English,  をもって focuses on the cessation of a previous state or the defined end date.\n\n**Etymology:**\n\nThe term もって originates from the verb **持つ** (motsu - to hold, to have).  Therefore, you can think of it literally as \"holding onto\" or \"having reached\" a specific point in time, marking that point as significant for a conclusion or a new effective date.",
