    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of the particle 「と」, the verb 「言う」 (to say), and the noun 「こと」 (thing). Literally, it translates to \"the thing that is said,\" but functionally, it nominalizes a phrase.",
    "writeup": "「ということ」 is used to nominalize phrases in Japanese, effectively turning them into nouns. It combines the particle 「と」, the verb 「言う」, and the noun 「こと」, literally translating to something like \"that (A) is said to be.\" However, its actual usage is less formal.  To use it, attach it to the end of any phrase, omitting 「です」 or 「ます」.  It is often written entirely in hiragana. In casual conversation, 「という」 is often shortened to 「って」. You'll encounter this shortened form frequently in speech, manga, and similar contexts. 「ということ」 is also commonly used to clarify something someone else has said, similar to saying \"you mean that (A)?\" or \"you mean to say that (A)?\"",
