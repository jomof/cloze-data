    "etymology": "「上手(じょうず)」 literally translates to \"skillful hand.\" The particle 「の」 here nominalizes the verb that precedes it, turning the action into a noun. 「が」 marks the subject of the adjectival noun.",
    "writeup": "〜のが上手 (じょうず) means \"to be good at something.\" It functions similarly to 〜のが好き (すき, to like something). It is always used with the dictionary form of verbs.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   Using this grammar point to describe your own abilities can sound arrogant. To sound more humble, use 〜のが得意 (とくい, one's forte). Also, you can use 「謙譲語」 to express humility.\n*   To express being good at something in the past, conjugate 上手 into its past form. The verb remains in the dictionary form.",

            "nuance": "「お母さん」 refers to 「my mother」. The 「だった」 at the end of 「上手だった」 indicates that the speaker is talking about the past, which makes sense because the mother was 「young」 「若い頃」 in the past.",
