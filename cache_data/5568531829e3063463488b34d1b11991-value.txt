    "etymology": "でしかない is derived from 「だ」 (copula), 「で」 (conjunctive form of だ), 「しか」 (particle indicating limitation), and 「ない」 (negative い-adjective). Thus, it literally means \"it is nothing other than.\"",
    "writeup": "でしかない is a construction comprised of the conjunctive form of だ, で, the particle しか, and the い-adjective ない. Like all other しか-based structures, it indicates that the target word is \"no more than (A)\" or \"merely (A).\" The primary difference with でしかない compared to other similar grammar patterns is that it appears directly after nouns.\n\nAlthough でしかない can be used with either a positive or negative nuance, it's often used with a slightly negative nuance in relation to (A), indicating that it has no value or significant meaning beyond (A).",
