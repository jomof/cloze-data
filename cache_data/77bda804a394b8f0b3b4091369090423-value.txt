    "etymology": "The verb 「上がる」(agaru) inherently means \"to rise\" or \"to go up.\" When attached to the ます-stem of another verb, it carries the nuance of something rising to completion, or reaching its end state. Similarly, 「上げる」(ageru) means \"to raise\" or \"to lift up.\" When used as a suffix, it implies the act of bringing something to completion, raising it to its final state.",
    "writeup": "When used after the -masu stem of a verb, either of the verbs 「上げる」 (ageru, \"to raise\") or 「上がる」 (agaru, \"to rise\") can indicate that something has been done \"to the limit\" or completely. 「上がる」 is used for actions that happen by themselves (intransitive), while 「上げる」 is used for actions with an instigator (transitive).  While both show something done \"to the limit,\" the nuance is usually \"to do (A) to the point of completion\" or \"to do (A) through to the end.\"  The \"limit\" highlighted is usually a natural ending, not due to lack of resources. They are most often used when an effect or product results from the action.  The literal meaning of \"to (A) up\" closely resembles \"to finish up (A)\" in English.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「仕上がる」(shiagaru) is a very common expression for various completions. It usually means something is completed after an involved or time-consuming process.",
