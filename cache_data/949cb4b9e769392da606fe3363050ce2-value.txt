    "etymology": "一体 (ittai) literally means \"one body\" or \"one form.\" The nuance is that the speaker is seeking a unified or coherent explanation for something that seems incomprehensible or unacceptable.",
    "writeup": "一体 (ittai) is an adverb used to express a strong feeling of surprise, disbelief, or frustration. It often appears at the beginning of sentences containing a question word like 何 (nani - what), 誰 (dare - who), どこ (doko - where), or なぜ (naze - why). While it can be written in kanji, it's frequently seen in hiragana as いったい. Think of it as adding emphasis to your question, like asking \"What *on earth*...?\" or \"What *the heck*...?\"\n\nWhile less common, 一体に (ittai ni) can also mean \"generally.\" However, its use to express surprise or shock is more prevalent in modern Japanese.",
