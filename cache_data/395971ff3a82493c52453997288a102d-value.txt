  "writeup": "The grammar point \"なくてはいけない\" (nakute wa ikenai) translates to \"must do\" or \"have to do.\"  It's formed by combining the negative te-form of a verb (なくて - nakute) with the phrase \"wa ikenai.\"  While seemingly a double negative, it expresses obligation or necessity.  Think of it as \"must not not do.\" This construction is commonly used in formal settings, conveying a sense of duty or strong necessity.  While \"nakute wa ikenai\" is the standard form, more casual variations exist, such as \"nakutecha ikenai\" and even shorter forms like \"nakutecha.\" These casual forms are more suitable for informal conversations. The choice between formal and casual forms depends heavily on context and relationship between speakers.  Mastering this nuance is key to communicating naturally.",
  "etymology": "The phrase is built upon the combination of the negative te-form (な<verb>くて) and the expression 必要がある (iruyouga aru - 'there's a need').  The 'wa ikenai' part comes from the negative potential form of 行く (iku - 'go'), which is structurally similar to other negative potential forms of verbs. Therefore, this grammar point is not only grammatically interesting but also showcases the historical evolution of expressing obligation in Japanese.",
