    "etymology": "The particle 「の」 originally indicated possession or belonging, but it evolved to also function as a nominalizer, turning adjectives into nouns. When followed by 「は」, it emphasizes the 'one' being described.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「の」 can function as a nominalizer, effectively turning an adjective into a noun. Think of it as \"the one that is [adjective]\" or \"the [adjective] one.\" When used with 「な」-adjectives (like *kirei na*), you need to insert 「な」 before 「の」. The particle 「は」 adds emphasis or marks the topic of the sentence.",
