    "writeup": "This grammar point, **Verb[volitional] + としたが**, expresses an attempt or intention to do something that was interrupted or didn't come to fruition.  It combines the **volitional form** of a verb (expressing intention, like \"let's do~\") with **とする** (to try to do, to be about to do), and the conjunctive particle **が** (but, however).  The **volitional form + とする** part indicates the decision and the imminent action, while the **が** signals an unexpected interruption or a contrary outcome.  This construction emphasizes that the speaker had made up their mind to act, but something prevented it. The nuance suggests that the reason for the interruption is often unanticipated.",
