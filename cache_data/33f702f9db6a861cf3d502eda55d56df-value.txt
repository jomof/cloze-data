    "etymology": "The grammar point 「だけに」 is composed of 「だけ」 (dake), meaning 'only' or 'just', and 「に」 (ni), a particle that can indicate reason or cause. Thus, it literally means 'just because of' or 'only in that'. This etymology reflects the grammar point's function of highlighting a specific reason or cause for a particular outcome or situation.",
    "writeup": "「だけに」 is used to express that something is as one would expect, or is natural, given a certain reason or circumstance. It combines 「だけ」 ('just', 'only') with 「に」 (a particle indicating reason or purpose). Think of it as drawing attention to a specific condition to highlight why the result is not surprising, or is even intensified. It's similar to saying \"just in that it's (A), (B) is considered a level above what would usually be expected.\" 「だけに」 can be used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (followed by 「な」), and nouns. The result can be either positive or negative.",
