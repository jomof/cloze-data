    "writeup": "ずにはすまない is used to indicate that one “has no choice but to (A)”, or “won’t get away without doing (A)”. It is a **formal** expression that combines the negative classical auxiliary verb, ず, the case-marking particle に, the adverbial particle は, and the standard negated form of the う-Verb 済む ‘to come to pass’, or ‘to finish’.  The more literal translation is “it will not come to pass that (A) is not done,” with more natural English interpretations conveying the same feeling.  As the expression begins with ず, it exclusively follows verbs.  When ず is used with する, ぜず is the correct conjugation.  The standard (ない) negative form of a verb may also be followed by ではすまない, which has the same meaning as ずにはすまない.  \n\n**Important Consideration:** This construction can sound unnatural if the speaker's sense of necessity is purely personal. (A) is usually something considered an expected course of action by most.",
