    "etymology": "「と」 is a particle indicating a listing of items. 「どちら」 is the polite form of 「どっち」, meaning \"which way\" or \"which one\". 「が」 is a particle marking the subject of the sentence.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「と〜と、どちらが」 is used to ask which of two options someone prefers or considers better. It's composed of 「と」, the 'and' particle, 「どちら」 (polite version of 「どっち」) meaning \"which\", and 「が」, the subject marker. This structure is suitable only when offering precisely two choices.\n\nYou can use verbs in this structure by nominalizing them with 「こと」 or 「の」. While 「どちら」 is more polite, you can use the more casual 「どっち」 instead. The second 「と」 can often be omitted, as 「どちら」 itself implies a choice between two things. 「どちらのほう」 or 「どっちのほう」 are also acceptable and add a subtle emphasis on the \"direction\" of the choice, similar to \"which one are you leaning towards?\"",
