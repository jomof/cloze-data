  "writeup": "The ている② form, often shortened to てる in casual conversation, describes a state of being resulting from a completed action.  It's crucial to understand that unlike English, which often uses the present perfect tense ('has/have done'), Japanese uses ている② to express the *current state* resulting from a past action.  This means the action is complete, but its effects persist.  Think of it as \"having done X and now being in the state of having done X.\"  For example, \"The door is closed\" (ドアが閉まっている) doesn't just mean the act of closing happened; it means the door *remains* closed.  Many verbs can be conjugated with this construction. Mastering ている② significantly enhances your ability to describe ongoing states and the consequences of past actions.   Important Considerations:  While this form is generally standard, the shortened form 'てる' is far more common in everyday speech.  This applies across all tenses and politeness levels.",
  "etymology": "The ている② form is derived from the combination of the て-form of a verb and the verb いる (iru, to be/exist).  The いる component contributes the sense of ongoing state or condition.",

      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "polite non-past",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「ずっと泣いています」 emphasizes the continuous nature of her crying.  The male speaker's choice of polite form shows respect while also creating a sense of slight distance. The listener's age doesn't necessarily affect the choice of language."

      "japanese": "この本はもう読んじゃったよ。",
      "english": "I've already read this book.",

      "conjugation": "plain past",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "「読んじゃったよ」is very casual and characteristic of a younger speaker. The choice of past tense highlights the completion of the action, while the 'ja' emphasizes completion and a feeling of having finished something quite quickly."

    {
      "japanese": "あのね、君のことがずっと好きで…**いた**んだ。",

      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「あのね」and 「…いたんだ」 create a softer, intimate tone appropriate for a flirtatious confession.  The past tense implies that the feeling has been ongoing and continues, which is common in this kind of romantic setting.  The female speaker uses this form to express her feelings subtly but meaningfully."

    {
      "japanese": "すみません、会議が終わってからすぐに連絡します。",

      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": "polite non-past",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「すみません」and 「連絡します」 are crucial in a professional setting.  The use of 「終わってから」 emphasizes the conditional nature of the action.  The polite form shows respect for the listener and maintains professional decorum. "
