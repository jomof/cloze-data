    "etymology": "「なぜ」 (naze) means \"why,\" and 「か」 (ka) is a question particle. However, 「なぜか」 doesn't form a question. It expresses a sense of wonder or uncertainty about the reason for something.",
    "writeup": "「なぜか」 (nazeka) is an adverb used to express that the speaker doesn't know the reason for something. It conveys a sense of mystery or that something is happening without a clear cause. While 「なぜ」 by itself means \"why\", 「なぜか」 isn't a question but rather a statement expressing a lack of understanding. It often sets a tone of mild surprise or curiosity. It's frequently used in more formal contexts, but is also found in everyday conversation. Note that it comes at the beginning of the sentence.",
