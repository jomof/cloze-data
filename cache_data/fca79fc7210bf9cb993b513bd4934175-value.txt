It's used to convey that the speaker is overwhelmed by an emotion, whether positive or negative. 「堪らない」 is slightly more formal and often seen in writing, while 「たまらない」 is more common in everyday conversation. It is often used with the 「て」 form of verbs or adjectives. For adjectives, use the stem of い-adjectives + 「くて」 and the stem of な-adjectives + 「で」.",
