  "writeup": "This expression, ったら・といったら, emphasizes the extreme degree of something, often negative, to the point where words fail to capture it fully.  It's a set phrase typically used after adjectives or descriptive phrases expressing a strong feeling or state, such as disappointment, astonishment, or embarrassment.  The nuance is one of intense feeling exceeding normal descriptive capabilities.  It's important to note that unlike similar expressions, this one is *exclusively* used in a negative context. Think of it as conveying a feeling so intense it surpasses the limits of ordinary language. This expression is versatile and can be incorporated into a wide range of contexts, enhancing descriptive power significantly.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of  ったら・といったら is rooted in the conditional form (たら) of the verb, suggesting a hypothetical situation or consequence of the preceding adjective. The repetition and the addition of とい (meaning 'to say') intensify the emphasis on the indescribable nature of the feeling or state.",
