    "etymology": "「くせに」 is derived from the noun 「癖(くせ)」 meaning \"habit\" or \"vice,\" combined with the case marking particle 「に」.  The original sense of 「癖」 was a tendency or inclination, often towards something negative. Adding 「に」 highlights a contradiction or unexpected situation given that tendency.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **くせに** (usually written without kanji) expresses **surprise, disapproval, or criticism** about a situation that contradicts what one would expect based on a certain fact or attribute. It's similar to saying \"even though\" or \"despite\" in English, but with a stronger feeling of **discontent or reproach**.  It's often used when the speaker feels the subject's actions are inappropriate or unjustified given their circumstances.  Since **くせ** is a noun, **くせに** follows the dictionary form of verbs, i-adjectives, and na-adjectives (functioning as nouns with な).  It also follows nouns directly.",
