  "writeup": "という理由で (to iu riyuu de) is a phrase used to provide a reason or justification for a preceding statement or action.  It literally translates to \"with that reason,\" but functions more like \"for that reason\" or \"on the grounds of that.\"  The emphasized nature of the reason given makes it similar to the English phrase \"being that.\" The particle で marks the reason as the means or instrument.  It's important to note the difference between this phrase and というわけで (to iu wake de), which is often interchangeable.  However, という理由で emphasizes the inherent logic or justification of the reason more strongly than というわけで.",
  "etymology": "The phrase combines という (to iu, 'to say that'), 理由 (riyuu, 'reason'), and で (de, a particle indicating means or instrument).  理由 (riyuu) is also sometimes written as 訳 (wake), which means roughly the same thing but with a slightly different nuance and can be used more widely;  however, 訳 in this instance cannot easily be switched out for 理由. The term わけ (wake) as a reading of 理由 relates etymologically to the concept of 'reasoning', 'cause', or 'explanation'.",
