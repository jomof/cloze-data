  "writeup": "The grammar point にしても adds nuance to a sentence, highlighting an unexpected or surprising element.  Think of it as emphasizing a secondary point (B) in relation to a primary point (A).  While にしては focuses on (A) being considered in a certain way, にしても shifts the emphasis to the surprising or unexpected aspect of (B) coexisting with (A).  The particle に marks the location or state, and も adds the additional nuance of something unexpected.  It's commonly translated as \"even considering (A), (B)\" or \"even while (A), (B)\".  It can be used with any plain-form word.  It's frequently used with Japanese WH-words (どこ, どの, だれ, なに, etc.), emphasizing that even with an uncertain (A), (B) still holds true.  For instance, \"Even if the location is unknown (A), we still need to go (B)\". Importantly, unlike としても (which will be covered later), にしても can introduce entirely new, unrelated points.  にしろ is similar, but it emphasizes a contrast between two points rather than presenting them as simultaneously existing. ",
  "etymology": "にしても is a combination of に (marking a location or state) and して (a verb meaning 'doing' or 'with'), followed by も (an emphasizing particle). The combination creates a complex adverbial phrase conveying a sense of concession or despite.",
