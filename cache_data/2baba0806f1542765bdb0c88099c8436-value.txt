  "writeup": "The grammar point \"てあげる\" combines the te-form of a verb with the verb あげる (ageru, \"to give\").  It expresses doing something for someone else as a favor or kindness.  The person receiving the action is marked with に (ni), while the person doing the action is marked with が (ga) if explicitly stated.  \n\n**Important Considerations:** Using てあげる can sound patronizing, especially towards elders or superiors.  This is because it carries a subtle connotation of condescension—doing something for someone because they are incapable, rather than out of genuine kindness.  While politeness is intended, the effect can be quite the opposite.  The more natural and less potentially offensive alternative is often てくれる (tekureru). \n\n**Etymology:**  The original meaning of あげる (ageru) was broader, even encompassing actions like giving water to plants or food to animals. This shows a subtle shift in meaning over time, where 'giving' evolved to encompass 'doing something for'. The modern usage reflects a nuanced understanding of social hierarchy and politeness, where a seemingly benevolent action can be perceived negatively if not carefully chosen.",

      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "plain past",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses past tense, suggesting a completed action. The familial relationship (father and sister) justifies the use of てあげる, though even here it might be preferable to use てくれた in some contexts."

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": "plain non-past",
      "nuance": "The casual \"よ\" (yo) and the offer of help indicate a friendly interaction.  However, the use of てあげる here is still potentially problematic, depending on the relationship of the speaker to the listener."

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The polite form \"ましょうか\" (mashou ka) and the address \"部長\" (buchou) are appropriate for a professional setting.  However, the てあげる construction still carries a slight risk of sounding condescending, and might better be avoided in more formal contexts."

      "japanese": "ねえ、君の荷物を運んで**あげようか**？",

      "conjugation": "volitional",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The casual tone and the use of \"ねえ\" (nee) create a flirty atmosphere, but the use of てあげようか is risky. The implied slight condescension might be interpreted as playfully teasing, or as patronizing depending on the nuance of tone and delivery. The sentence structure itself, with the question mark, implies this as a friendly offer, not a forced one, so the condescending aspect is minimized."

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of  \"あなたのために\" (anata no tame ni) adds a romantic flavor and the polite \"あげます\" (agemasu) is appropriate for a first meeting. The “よ” (yo) is friendly, but not overly casual, which is appropriate for someone trying to make a good impression on a first date."

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key distinction lies in the perspective and the implication of the action.  てあげる emphasizes the doer's kindness, てくれる expresses gratitude for the doer's act, てもらう shows the benefit to the receiver, and あげる simply means giving something tangible or intangible.  Consider who benefits from the action and express that clearly to avoid confusion."
