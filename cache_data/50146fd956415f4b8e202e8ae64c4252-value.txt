    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed from の (nominalizer), で (copula), は (topic marker), ない (negative), だろう (conjecture), and か (question particle). Literally, it could be understood as \"Isn't it probably that...?\".",
    "writeup": "「のではないだろうか」 is a Japanese grammar pattern used to express an opinion or thought in a tentative and indirect way, often seeking agreement or confirmation from the listener. It translates to phrases like \"I think it's..., isn't it?\", \"It might be that...\", or \"Don't you agree?\". The structure combines the nominalizer 「の」, the negative copula 「ではない」, the conjecture 「だろう」, and the question particle 「か」.  Using this pattern softens the assertion, making it sound more polite and less forceful.  It's commonly used after verbs and い-adjectives in their plain form, and after な-adjectives and nouns with the addition of 「な」. 「でしょう」 can be used in place of 「だろう」 for a more polite tone. This grammar point is effective for expressing speculation, making gentle suggestions, or seeking consensus.",
