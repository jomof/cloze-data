  "writeup": "The auxiliary verb らしい (rashii) is very similar to the auxiliary verbs そうだ (souda) and ようだ (youda), in that it expresses something the speaker 'thinks' is true. This use is known as 推定 (suittei, presumption) in Japanese. However, despite being a presumption/assumption, らしい usually sounds relatively confident. らしい is regularly translated as 'it seems like (A)', or 'I heard that (A)'. To use らしい, attach it to the end of any (non-polite) verb, adjective, or noun. In these examples, らしい indicates that the speaker has some reason to believe that (A) is true. This could be that they heard, saw, or read something, but are still not 100% sure whether their understanding is correct or not. In this way, it sounds very similar to 'it appears as though (A)' in English.  There are 2 main forms of らしい in Japanese: the auxiliary verb usage mentioned above, and the 形容詞の一部 (keiyoushi no ichibu, auxiliary adjective), a type of adjective that must be attached to another word to have meaning.  The い-adjective use of らしい, meaning something that is 'typical of (A)', will be covered in a later lesson.",

      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the plain form よ, which is typical of casual conversation.  The use of 「らしい」 suggests a degree of uncertainty but a relatively high degree of confidence. The speaker is expressing an assumption rather than a confirmed fact. "

      "japanese": "彼はダイエットを続ける**らしい**です。",
      "english": "He seems to be continuing his diet.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The polite です ending indicates a formal register.  The sentence conveys the information politely and respectfully, appropriate for a conversation with a superior or someone you don't know well.  The use of 「らしい」 again displays a presumption."

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses a casual sentence structure with 「よ」 and conversational particles like 「んだけど」 which would be completely unnatural in a formal setting.  The use of 「らしい」 indicates the speaker isn't completely certain, basing it off of information from the newspaper."

    {
      "japanese": "ねえ、聞いた？タケシ君がキヨミちゃんにプロポーズする**らしい**よ。",

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the casual ending 「よ」.  The speaker presents the information as hearsay, leaning on the uncertainty of 「らしい」.  The use of 「ねえ」 and 「聞いた？」 are typical of informal speech."

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "This sentence is casual due to the use of 「よ」. The 「らしい」 suggests the speaker received the information second-hand, not through direct observation."

      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The polite ending 「ですよ」 and the use of honorific 「先輩」 show respect for the listener. The speaker uses 「らしい」 to convey a degree of uncertainty while still reporting information received from someone else."

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「ね」 softens the compliment, typical in informal, intimate settings. The speaker uses 「らしい」 to compliment masculinity using the implicit meaning 'typical of a man'. The choice of 「男らしい」 is a commonly used phrase by women, adding to the sentence's flirtatious tone."

      "conjugation": "plain past",
      "nuance": "The use of the past tense 「らしかった」 reflects on a past experience. The 「ね」 is a typical casual sentence-ending particle confirming shared understanding. The sentence is casual, appropriate for friends sharing a recollection."

      "conjugation": "plain negative past",
      "nuance": "The speaker is expressing a negative assumption. The casual 「みたい」 adds nuance, showing that the speaker isn't entirely certain, rather than stating something as a fact.  The negative past tense is employed to indicate a change in his behavior."
