    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「に」 (case-marking particle), 「する」 (to do) in its て-form 「して」, and 「見る」 (to see) in its conditional ば-form 「見れば」. Literally, it means \"assuming that I were (A) and then looking from that perspective.\"",
    "writeup": "「にしてみれば」, usually written entirely in hiragana, is used to express a hypothetical statement from someone else's point of view. It often translates to \"from the point of view of (A), (B),\" \"in the case of (A), (B),\" or simply \"for (A), (B).\" The literal meaning is akin to \"assuming I were (A) and looking from there, (B).\"\n\n「にしてみれば」 follows nouns representing people or organizations that represent people. The (B) part of the phrase typically discusses how the speaker assumes the person or group would feel in a given situation. Consequently, sentences often conclude with 「だろう」, 「でしょう」, 「かもしれない」, or similar expressions, indicating speculation or uncertainty.",
