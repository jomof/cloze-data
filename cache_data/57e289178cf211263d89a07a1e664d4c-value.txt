    "writeup": "「だけしか」 combines the adverbial particles 「だけ」 (**only**) and 「しか」 (**nothing but**). It is used to emphasize that something is the **sole** possibility or option.  It typically follows a noun, and the subsequent part of the sentence will contain a word with negative meaning (often 「ない」).  While other combinations are possible, 「だけしか～ない」 is the most common construction.\n\n**Key Differences between だけ and しか:**\n\n*   **だけ:**  Highlights a single item from a group, identifying it as the **only** one that meets a specific condition.\n*   **しか:** Emphasizes that something exists **without any alternatives**.\n\nThink of 「だけ」 as saying \"just this,\" while 「しか」 adds \"and absolutely only this!\"  Reversing the order to 「しかだけ」 is grammatically incorrect because the logical flow of selection requires identifying the single item first.",
