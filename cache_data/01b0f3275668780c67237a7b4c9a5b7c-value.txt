  },
  "etymology": "The structure is built upon こと (koto, thing/matter), the particle は (wa, topic marker), and ない (nai, negative adjective).  こと acts as a nominalizer, transforming the preceding verb into a noun phrase.  The は particle highlights this noun phrase as the topic of the sentence, emphasizing its non-existence or lack of necessity. ない provides the negative assertion.",
  "writeup": "The expression ことない (koto nai) serves two primary functions in Japanese: 1) to indicate that something is unnecessary, and 2) to state that something never occurs.  The phrase always follows a verb, which is nominalized by こと.  The structure emphasizes the absence or impossibility of the action. It's often used to reassure someone or to express a definitive fact.  The nuance differs from たことがない (ta koto ga nai), which focuses on a single past instance.  Unlike が (ga), which marks the subject, は (wa) presents the verb phrase as the topic, drawing attention to its non-existence.  Therefore, ことない often implies the action is unthinkable or even impossible.  This is a standard, versatile structure used across various contexts and registers.",
