    "etymology": "する originates from the Old Japanese verb 仕る (siru), which meant 'to serve' or 'to do'. Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass a wider range of actions and eventually evolved into the modern する.",

    "writeup": "する is a highly versatile verb meaning \"to do.\" It is one of the two main irregular verbs in Japanese, along with 来る (to come). Unlike regular verbs, する does not follow standard Godan or Ichidan conjugation rules. Instead, it's a *sa-gyō henkaku dōshi* (さ行変格動詞), which means its conjugation is irregular in the さ-row.\n\nCommon usages of する include:\n\n*   **Performing actions:** This is the most basic meaning, where する translates directly to \"to do.\" It's often used with nouns to indicate performing that action, for example, 勉強**する** (benkyō **suru**) - to study.\n*   **Making something into something:**  It can also mean "to make," used to transform something into a different state, for example, 医者**にする** (isha **ni suru**) - to make (someone) a doctor.\n\nBecause of its irregularity, mastering the conjugations of する is **essential** for fluency. The core conjugations stem from the root す (su). Some key forms include:\n\n*   します (shimasu) - polite non-past\n*   した (shita) - plain past\n*   しない (shinai) - plain negative\n*   して (shite) - te-form\n\nIn essence, think of する as a general verb that indicates external action or effect.",
