    "writeup": "又（また）～も combines the adverb 又 (mata), a noun, and the adverbial particle も (mo). It signifies adding more information, similar to \"moreover,\" \"additionally,\" or \"furthermore.\"  Because も is used, the information following 又～も is usually new. The basic structure is: (A) statement, 又 (B) noun + も.  For added emphasis, you can use でも (demo) or ても (temo) instead of も. \n\n**Fun Fact:** The kanji 又 (mata) and 叉 (mata) have an interesting semantic distinction. 又 indicates things that diverge but then rejoin, hence its meaning of 'again' or 'in addition'.  叉, on the other hand, signifies a clear split or division, like 'a fork in the road' or 'crotch'.",
