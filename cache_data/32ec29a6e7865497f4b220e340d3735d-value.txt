  "writeup": "を良いことに (wo yoi koto ni) is a nuanced Japanese expression translating to \"taking advantage of.\"  It implies using a situation or circumstance, often implicitly positive, for one's own gain, especially when this gain is considered slightly dubious or morally questionable. The structure combines を (wo - marking the object), 良い (yoi - good), こと (koto - thing), and に (ni - indicating purpose or means).  It's not simply \"using something as an opportunity,\" but rather using it in a way that might be considered opportunistic or even underhanded. This is frequently found following verbs, nouns, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives; preceding the grammar point you will usually find either の or なの, following standard conjugation rules.  The addition of して (shite) at the end is common and doesn't materially alter the meaning.  This expression is used across various registers, but careful consideration of context is vital.",
  "etymology": "The etymology is straightforward.  良い (yoi) is the i-adjective meaning \"good,\" こと (koto) is the noun meaning \"thing,\" and に (ni) is a particle indicating purpose or circumstance.  The entire phrase builds upon the basic structure of using a noun phrase modified by を and に to express an opportunistic action. The lack of a direct equivalent in English highlights the expression's uniquely Japanese cultural nuance.",

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "While seemingly simple, mastering を良いことに requires a keen understanding of context. The key is recognizing the implied opportunistic and sometimes morally ambiguous nature of the action.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "を契機に",
      "meaning": "Lead to, As a good opportunity to, As a result of, As a trigger",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike を良いことに, which implies a slightly dubious or opportunistic use of a circumstance, を契機に (wo kiki ni) simply means 'using something as an opportunity' or 'taking something as a trigger,' with no inherent negative connotation."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The difference between を良いことに and を契機に lies in the implied moral judgment. を良いことに suggests a self-serving and potentially manipulative use of the situation, whereas を契機に is neutral and simply describes a cause-and-effect relationship or the seizing of an opportunity, regardless of ethical implications."
