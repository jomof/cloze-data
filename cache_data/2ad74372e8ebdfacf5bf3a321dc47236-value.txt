  "writeup": "～てやまない is a formal grammatical construction in Japanese. It combines the て-form of a verb with the negative form of the u-verb 止む (yamu), meaning \"to cease\" or \"to desist.\"  The literal meaning, \"to not stop (doing A)\" or \"to not desist (doing A),\" is often translated as \"to always (do A)\" or \"to (do A) from the bottom of one's heart.\"  This construction is exclusively used to express strong, persistent feelings and emotions.  Commonly paired verbs include 愛する (aisuru, to love), 敬愛する (keiai suru, to love and respect), 願う (negau, to wish for), and 祈る (inoru, to pray).  Both positive and negative emotions can be expressed using this structure.  Important Consideration: Because てやまない emphasizes the *continuation* of a feeling, it's unsuitable for temporary emotions like fleeting anger or momentary disappointment.",
  "etymology": "The construction's power lies in its combination of the te-form, indicating a continuous action, and the negative of 止む (yamu), emphasizing the unending nature of the emotion.  止む itself carries connotations of inevitability and cessation, making its negation a powerful expression of unstoppable feeling.",
