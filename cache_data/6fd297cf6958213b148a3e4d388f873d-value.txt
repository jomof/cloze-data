    "etymology": "The word どの comes from the same family of words as どれ (which one) and どこ (where). All these words share a root indicating selection or location from a range of possibilities.",
    "writeup": "どの is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞, rentaishi) in Japanese. These words do not conjugate, meaning they always appear in the same form. どの is used to ask about \"which\" thing someone will choose, and it comes from the same family of words as どれ and どこ.\n\nIt can be used in questions or similarly to \"whatever\" or \"whichever\" in English. Be cautious: どの is only used when there are three or more possible choices. When there are only two possible choices, どっち (の) or どちら (の) should be used instead.",
