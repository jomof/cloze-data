    "writeup": "While だが (or ですが as a polite equivalent) are classified as their own words, they are actually combinations of だ, or です, and が.  だが is usually used as a formal way of saying \"but\", or \"nevertheless\".  Think of it like saying \"that may be so, but…\" in English.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   だが can be used at the beginning of a sentence or between two clauses.\n*   ですが is the polite version of だが. When using ですが, ensure the rest of the sentence maintains a polite register.\n*   Adding ね to だが (だがね) can soften the tone, but this is less common in modern Japanese and more associated with older speakers.\n*   In casual conversation, でも is a much more common and natural-sounding equivalent to だが/ですが.",
