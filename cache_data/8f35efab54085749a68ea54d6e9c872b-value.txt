  "writeup": "嫌い (kirai), meaning \"dislike,\" is a common な-adjective in Japanese.  Unlike most い-adjectives, it takes な, だ, or です depending on its grammatical function.  When used independently, it acts as a noun and takes だ or です. When modifying a noun, it takes な.  This difference is subtle but crucial.  For example,  \"パイナップルが嫌いだ\" (painappuru ga kirai da) asserts that pineapple *is* dislikeable, while \"きらいな食べ物\" (kirai na tabemono) describes food as *being* disliked.  Just as 好き (suki) can be intensified with 大 (oo) to mean \"love,\" 嫌い can become 大嫌い (daikirai) to mean \"hate.\"  Remember: despite ending in い, 嫌い is a な-adjective—a key point to remember.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of 嫌い is quite straightforward. It's a compound word formed from the verb 嫌う (kirau) meaning \"to dislike\" and the suffix い (i) which forms な-adjectives.  The い-ending is somewhat misleading, as explained previously.",
  "examples": [

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses \"かも\" (kamo), adding uncertainty.  The use of \"彼\" (kare) and the softer expression is typical of a young female speaker. 「彼、ちょっと嫌いかも…」 specifically employs softer vocabulary often associated with female speech."

      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "nuance": "This flirty sentence uses 「大嫌い」 (daikirai) intensified with \"大\"(oo), indicating a strong feeling, yet the negative makes it a playful, teasing statement.  The use of \"君\" (kimi) adds a touch of intimacy.  The speaker, using casual speech, is playful and slightly teasing, common in flirting."

      "nuance": "This sentence, with its casual register and use of  「君」 (kimi), conveys intimacy. The statement, though seemingly neutral, hints at a deeper affection. 「な」 (na) is a sentence ending often associated with male speech."

      "nuance": "The exclamation mark shows excitement.  The use of the phrase 「初めてだよ」(hajimete da yo)  is youthful and casual. 「あんなに嫌いな」 (anna ni kirai na) emphasizes the degree of dislike. The casual register and intensifying phrases are common in young people's speech."
