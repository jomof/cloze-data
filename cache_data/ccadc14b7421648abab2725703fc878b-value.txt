    "etymology": "「おかげで」 comes from 「お陰」 (okage), meaning 'shade' or 'influence,' combined with the particle 「で」 (de). The idea is that the positive outcome is metaphorically 'in the shade' or under the protection of someone or something's good influence. 「陰」 originally referred to a shaded or hidden place, but it took on the meaning of protection or support.",
    "writeup": "「おかげで」 (okage de) is used to express gratitude or indicate that something positive happened due to someone or something's influence. It combines the polite prefix 「お」 (o-), the noun 「陰」 (kage - shade), and the case-marking particle 「で」 (de). Literally, it means \"in the shade of (A),\" implying that (B) was made possible because (A) created a favorable situation.  It can be translated as \"thanks to (A)\" or \"because of (A).\" \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「おかげで」 can be used sarcastically, similar to how \"thanks to (A)\" is used in English to express frustration. The context and tone of voice usually make the intended meaning clear.\n*   It's often used at the beginning of a sentence to mean \"thankfully\" or \"luckily,\" indicating a positive outcome despite potential negative outcomes.",
