  "writeup": "The Japanese passive voice, formed using the auxiliary verbs れる and られる, presents a nuanced perspective compared to English.  While English emphasizes the actor performing the action, Japanese focuses on the *lack of control* experienced by the subject.  This is why the subject is sometimes referred to as the なる人 (naru hito – the 'becoming' person), and the actor as the する人 (suru hito – the 'doing' person).  This subtle shift in focus is key to understanding the passive voice's various applications.  The forms れる and られる are attached to the stem of the verb.  Godan (う-verbs) change their final syllable to the 'a' row equivalent before adding the passive marker.  Ichidan (る-verbs) simply replace the final る with られる. する becomes される, and くる becomes こられる. The particle に marks the actor, though から is also used when the action is less direct.  Importantly,  られる has multiple interpretations beyond the basic 'passive' sense, including potential, spontaneous action, and even a form of polite respect. Removing the ら (ra-nuki kotoba) in れる is common for expressing potential, but generally avoided for other passive meanings.  Mastering this grammar point requires understanding these contexts. ",

  "etymology": "The passive verb endings れる/られる are derived from the older forms れり/られり, which themselves are thought to have evolved from a combination of the verb stem and an auxiliary verb expressing a passive or potential sense.
