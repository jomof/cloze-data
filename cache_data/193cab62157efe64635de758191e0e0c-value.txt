  "writeup": "いたす (itasu), often written as 致す, is a humble *u*-verb used to express the speaker's actions, or actions performed by those close to the speaker, such as their colleagues.  It's similar to お〜する in that it means \"to do,\" but it carries a stronger sense of humility.  For verbs ending in する, simply replace する with いたす. For other verbs, attach いたす to the masu-stem, prefixing お or ご depending on whether the word is of Japanese or Chinese origin.  \n**Important Considerations:** Words containing the kanji 拝 (to worship, revere) usually don't require お, ご, or いたす because they are inherently respectful.  いたす is generally considered slightly more humble than お〜する, hence its frequent use in advertisements or by company employees to convey deference.",
  "etymology": "The verb いたす is composed of the prefix い (i-) and the verb たす (tasu), meaning \"to add.\" In this humble form, the action is presented as a contribution or service rendered to the listener or a superior. This humility is emphasized through the use of the u-verb conjugation, indicating a high level of politeness.",
