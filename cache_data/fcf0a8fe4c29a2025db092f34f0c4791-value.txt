  "writeup": "The grammar point ～てこそ (～te koso) is a sophisticated expression used to emphasize the crucial condition for something to be true or possible.  It's built upon the て-form (te-form) of a verb, followed by こそ (koso), an emphatic particle.  Unlike simpler conditional structures, ～てこそ highlights the absolute necessity of the preceding clause for the following clause to hold.  Think of it as expressing a strong causal relationship where the first action is not merely a condition, but the *very essence* of the second.  The nuance can be subtle, but the key is the essential, indispensable nature of the first clause.  The meaning often translates to 'only if... then...', 'because only...then...', or even 'unless...then...' depending on context.  This grammar point adds depth and emphasizes the irreplaceable role of the first action, lending a certain weight and seriousness to the statement. Mastering this adds elegance and precision to your Japanese.",
  "etymology": "こそ (koso) derives from the word こそ (koso), meaning \"only,\" \"indeed,\" or \"certainly.\"  The combination with the て-form emphasizes the indispensable nature of the preceding action. The て-form itself expresses a completed action or state, setting the stage for the emphatic consequence introduced by こそ.",
