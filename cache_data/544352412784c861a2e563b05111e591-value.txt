        "[Verb in dictionary form] + ように言う": "To tell, request, or order someone to do something in a particular way."

    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed by combining 「よう」 (you), meaning 'way' or 'manner,' with the verb 「言う」 (iu), meaning 'to say.' Together, they express the idea of saying something in a specific way or with a particular purpose.",
    "writeup": "「ように言う」 is an expression used to convey that someone is told, requested, or ordered to do something in a specific manner. It combines the auxiliary verb 「よう」 with the verb 「言う」. The 「よう」 takes its adverbial form 「ように」 when linking to 「言う」.\n\n*   **Nuance:** The expression indicates that the speaker is focusing on the manner in which the action is to be carried out. The person is being told to do something with a particular intention or instruction in mind.\n*   **Alternatives:** Depending on the context, 「頼む」 (tanomu - to request) or 「命じる」 (meijiru - to order) can be used instead of 「言う」. 「言う」 is versatile and can imply either ordering or requesting, based on tone and context.",
