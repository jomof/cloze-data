    "writeup": "**とは言うものの** is a set expression used to acknowledge a statement or fact, but then introduce a contrasting or qualifying point. It combines the particle **と** (indicating content), the topic marker **は**, the verb **言う** (to say), and the concessive conjunction **ものの** (although).  The literal sense is close to \"although it is said that...\"

    It can follow various parts of speech. When it comes after a noun or a な-adjective, **だ** is usually placed before **とは言うものの**.

    This grammar point can also appear at the beginning of a sentence, signaling that the speaker is acknowledging a previously mentioned point before adding their own, often contrasting, perspective.

    The part of the sentence following **ものの** typically contains the more important or defining information.",
