    "etymology": "The prefix 「お」 originates from classical Japanese and was initially used to denote respect towards items or people of high status. Over time, it became a common element in polite speech, extending its use to everyday language to show consideration and refinement.",
    "writeup": "The prefix 「お」 is a fundamental element of polite Japanese. It's attached to nouns, verbs, and adjectives to convey respect, politeness, or modesty. When used with verbs, it typically combines with the 「ます」 stem to form expressions like 「お飲みになります」 (to drink, honorific) or 「お持ちします」 (to hold, humble). It can also be used with い-adjectives (like 「お忙しい」 - busy) and な-adjectives. In some instances, 「お」 is used for the beautification of words, such as in 「お弁当」 (lunch box). It's important to note that not all words can take 「お」, and its usage often depends on convention and the degree of politeness required. While 「お」 generally makes the speaker more polite, it can sound over-the-top if overused. Be careful, especially when speaking to close friends and family.",
