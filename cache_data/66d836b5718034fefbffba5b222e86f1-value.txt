    "writeup": "「ていては」 is a grammatical structure used to express that **if a certain state or action continues, a negative consequence will likely follow**. It combines the て-form of a verb with 「いる」 in its て-form (いて) and the particle 「は」.  The core meaning conveys a sense of **undesirable continuation**.  Think of it as saying, \"If this state of affairs persists...\" or \"If you continue doing this...\".  The 「ては」 part itself has conjunctive uses, often indicating a hypothetical or repetitive situation, and in this case, it blends with the continuous aspect of 「ている」.",
