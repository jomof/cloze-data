  "writeup": "The expression 始末だ (shimatoda) is a nuanced way to describe an unfortunate or undesirable outcome.  It literally translates to \"this is the state of affairs,\" but it carries a stronger implication of regret or disappointment.  The noun 始末 (shimatsu) means 'settlement' or 'end result,' often referring to a negative conclusion arising from a preceding series of events.  Therefore, 始末だ emphasizes the final, and often unsatisfactory, consequence of a situation.  It's typically used after a description of the events leading to this negative outcome.  While grammatically straightforward, its subtle implications of regret and finality add a significant layer of meaning.  The usage is generally standard and not restricted to a particular gender, age, or region.",
  "etymology": "始末 (shimatsu) itself combines 始 (haji), meaning 'beginning,' and 末 (matsu), meaning 'end.'  The combination thus refers to the entire course of events from beginning to end, making 始末だ particularly effective in conveying the full weight of a negative conclusion.",
