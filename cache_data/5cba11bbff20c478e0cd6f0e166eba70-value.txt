  "writeup": "も構わず (mo kamawazu) is a versatile expression meaning \"without worrying about,\" \"regardless of,\" or \"despite.\" It combines も (mo, \"even,\" \"also\"), 構う (kamauu, \"to mind,\" \"to care\") in its negative form, and the adverbial suffix ず (zu).  The verb 構う itself carries the nuance of actively considering something, hence the emphasis on disregarding or ignoring the preceding element. This construction is typically followed by a clause indicating the action taken despite the initial consideration.  You'll find it used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (with の), and even nouns.  While commonly used in standard Japanese, its use in extremely formal settings might sound slightly unusual.  The structure emphasizes the speaker's disregard for the preceding factor.",
  "etymology": "The core of this grammar point lies in the verb 構う (kamauu), which etymologically relates to the idea of 'bracing' or 'preparing oneself' for something.  Its use in the negative, coupled with ず (zu) and も (mo), cleverly conveys the sense of not giving any pause to thought about the mentioned factor.  The literary auxiliary verb ず adds a sense of casual disregard, contributing to the overall nonchalant tone often associated with も構わず.",
