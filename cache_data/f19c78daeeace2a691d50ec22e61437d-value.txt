  "writeup": "The sentence-ending particle かな (kana) conveys a sense of gentle uncertainty or speculation, roughly translating to \"I wonder.\"  It's often used to express a personal thought or question, rather than a direct inquiry to someone else.  While historically considered slightly more feminine, its usage is now gender-neutral.  Its origin lies in the combination of か (ka), a question particle, and な (na), a sentence-ending particle expressing the speaker's personal feelings or opinions.  This beautifully reflects the nuance of かな – a hesitant question stemming from the speaker's own internal musings.  It's versatile, attaching to various sentence types and adding a touch of softness to the expression.",
  "etymology": "かな originates from the combination of the question particle か (ka) and the sentence-ending particle な (na).  か indicates a question, while な softens the statement, expressing a personal, uncertain thought. The combination perfectly encapsulates the hesitant, wondering tone of かな.",
