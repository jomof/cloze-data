    "writeup": "にあって is a relatively formal construction. Think of it as combining に (location/time) with あって (te-form of ある, \"to be\"). Thus, it describes something existing or occurring *in* a specific situation or under certain conditions. It's used to set the stage, highlighting noteworthy aspects of the given situation before elaborating further. You'll often see it translated as \"in the situation of (A)\" or \"under the conditions of (A).\" It often precedes a clause that explains something remarkable or noteworthy about that situation or circumstance.\n\nSometimes you'll see it followed by も, which indicates that despite the noteworthy situation described by (A), (B) isn't affected as one might expect.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\nDon't confuse this with the にあって used in phrases like 事故にあって (\"to meet with an accident\"). That あって is a conjugation of 遭う (\"to meet or happen upon, often something negative\"), while this あって is simply the te-form of ある.",
    "etymology": "にあって comes from combining the particle 「に」, indicating location or time, and 「あって」, which is the て-form of the verb 「ある」 (to exist, to be). The etymology reflects its function of situating an event or state within a specific context or set of circumstances.",
