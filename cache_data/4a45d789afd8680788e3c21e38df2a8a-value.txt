  "writeup": "を禁じ得ない (wo kinjiyukenai) is a formal Japanese expression conveying the inability to suppress a feeling or action.  It literally translates to \"cannot prohibit obtaining,\" but its idiomatic meaning is closer to \"cannot help but\" or \"cannot refrain from.\"  This nuanced expression is usually attached to emotions or reactions stemming from strong emotion, such as tears or laughter.  It's crucial to remember that this construction typically expresses the speaker's own feelings; using it to describe another person's emotions would sound unnatural. The structure combines the adverbial particle を (wo), the conjunctive form of the verb 禁じる (kinjiru, to prohibit), and the 得ない (enai) pattern, similar to the more common できない (dekinai).  While other conjugations of 禁じる exist, only the conjunctive form is used in this specific grammatical construction.  Therefore, you'll see this phrase following nouns or nominalized verbs (using の).",
  "etymology": "The etymology traces back to the verb 禁じる (kinjiru), meaning \"to prohibit\" or \"to forbid.\"  The addition of 得ない (e-nai), a negative potential form, creates the sense of inability to control or suppress the feeling. The structure's formality arises from the use of the conjunctive form of 禁じる and the somewhat archaic feel of 得ない in this particular context.",
