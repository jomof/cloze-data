    "writeup": "The grammar point **と来たら (tokitara)** is used to express the idea of \"when it comes to...\" or \"concerning...\". It sets up a topic and indicates the speaker's immediate or natural thought or feeling about it.  It's formed by combining the particle **と (to)**, the verb **来る (kuru)** meaning \"to come\", and the conditional たら (**tara**). Think of it as saying, \"If we're talking about (A)...\" then the natural consequence or thought is (B). Often, the speaker feels that the connection between (A) and (B) is obvious or goes without saying. You'll often see adverbs like **やっぱり (yappari)** or **やはり (yahari)**, meaning \"as expected\" or \"sure enough\", at the beginning of the (B) part of the sentence, emphasizing this feeling of inevitability or obviousness.",
