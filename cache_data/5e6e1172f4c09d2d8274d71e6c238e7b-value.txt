    "etymology": "The particle 「が」 marks the subject of the verb 「する」. In this construction, the sensation (smell, sound, taste, feeling) becomes the subject that 'is doing'. So, literally, it means '[sensation] is doing'.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, to describe sensory experiences (excluding sight), you can use the grammar point **がする**. This construction focuses on the *source* of the sensation. Instead of saying \"it smells like roses,\" you're saying \"the smell of roses is being emitted.\"  **がする** attaches directly to the noun describing the sensation.\n\nThink of it like this: the smell, sound, taste, or feeling is the 'thing' that is performing the action of 'being present' or 'emanating'.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Scope:**  **がする** is used for non-visual senses: smell (匂い), sound (音), taste (味), and feeling/sensation (感じ、気).\n*   **Subject Focus:** The noun before **が** is the subject of the sentence.\n*   **気(き)がする:** A common variation is **気がする**, which translates to \"to have a feeling that...\" or \"to sense that...\" It often expresses intuition or a vague feeling.",
