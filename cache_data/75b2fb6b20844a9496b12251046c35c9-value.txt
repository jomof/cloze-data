    "etymology": "みたい is derived from 見る (miru, to see) + たい (tai, want to), suggesting something that one wants to see or envisions. に and な are particles that connect みたい to verbs/clauses and nouns respectively, indicating similarity or resemblance.",
    "writeup": "みたい expresses resemblance or similarity, translating to \"like,\" \"similar to,\" or \"resembling.\" It acts as a *na*-adjective, requiring な when modifying nouns and に when modifying verbs or clauses. It's crucial to distinguish whether みたい describes a noun or verb, as the element being described isn't always immediately adjacent. For example, in 「プロみたいに泳ぎたい」, the verb 「泳ぐ」 (to swim) is modified by みたいに, indicating swimming in a manner similar to a professional. \n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Avoid confusing みたい (resembling) with 見たい (want to see). They are distinct despite sounding similar. みたい doesn't have a kanji form, which can help differentiate them.\n*   みたい is suitable for describing things perceived, imagined, or hoped for, implying a sense of approximation rather than exact equivalence.",
