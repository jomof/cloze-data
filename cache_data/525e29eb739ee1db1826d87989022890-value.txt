  "writeup": "The particle とおり (dōri), often written in kanji as 通り, literally means \"street\" or \"way.\" However, its grammatical function is far more nuanced.  It indicates a precise correspondence or conformity to something previously mentioned.  Think of it as expressing 'exactly as,' 'just as,' or 'in the same manner as.'  It's often used as a suffix following nouns and verbs.  When used with verbs, it can follow both the plain and past-tense forms. With nouns, both どおり (dōri) and のとおり (no tōri) are used, with のとおり being more common in written Japanese and どおり slightly more frequent in speech.  The construction is versatile and appears frequently in everyday conversation and formal writing.  Expressions like 言った通り (itta tōri, 'exactly as I said') and その通り (sono tōri, 'exactly so') are extremely common ways to express agreement.",
