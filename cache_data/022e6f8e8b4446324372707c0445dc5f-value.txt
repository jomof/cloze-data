    "writeup": "「そこで」 is a conjunction used to connect two sentences or clauses, indicating a logical or temporal relationship between them. It can be translated as \"then,\" \"therefore,\" \"and so,\" or \"at that point.\" The first part of the sentence often sets up a situation or reason, and 「そこで」 introduces the resulting action, decision, or outcome. It indicates that the second part of the sentence is a direct consequence or response to the first.",
