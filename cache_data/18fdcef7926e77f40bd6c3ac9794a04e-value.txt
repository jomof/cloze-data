    "etymology": "The particle 「よ」 has uncertain origins, but it is believed to have evolved from older forms of speech used to assert or emphasize a statement. Over time, it became a common sentence-ending particle used to convey new information or add emphasis to a speaker's assertion.",
    "writeup": "「よ」 is classified as a sentence-ending particle in Japanese. In most cases, it's used to convey new information to the listener or simply add emphasis. Like most sentence-ending particles, it's simply added to the end of almost any sentence.\n\nDespite the standard use of 「よ」 being to convey new information, it's also regularly paired with 「ね」 to convey the meaning of \"right?!\". This more literally means something closer to \"I think (A), and I bet you think (A) too!\"\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Note that there's a 「だ」 after the noun, but not after the い-adjective. This is a general conjugation rule. It is also acceptable to use 「ですよ」 after either type of adjective (or noun).",
