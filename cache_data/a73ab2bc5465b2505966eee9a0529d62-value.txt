  "writeup": "ぜ is an emphatic sentence-ending particle in Japanese used similarly to よ, but less strongly than ぞ.  It emphasizes the speaker's statement but is less forceful.  ぜ can follow any sentence ending in its plain form, including auxiliary verbs. With nouns, it follows the auxiliary verb だ.  Crucially, ぜ implies familiarity or closeness between speaker and listener. While often friendly, it can also be used with rivals or those with a similarly close, if competitive, relationship. This contrasts with ぞ, which is applicable to anyone.  Both ぜ and ぞ are almost exclusively masculine. \n\n**Fun Fact:** ぜ actually originates from a combination of ぞ and え (an alternate form of the sentence-ending particle い, as seen in だい or かい).  Since い carries a friendly or familiar nuance, ぜ retains this characteristic.  In essence, ぞえ evolved into ぜ over time.",
