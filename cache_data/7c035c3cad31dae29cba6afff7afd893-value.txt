  "writeup": "置きに is a combination of 置き, a suffix meaning 'opening' or 'interval', and the case marking particle に. Primarily written without kanji, it's an expression used to show that something happens 'every (A)', or 'at intervals of (A)'.  The distinction between 'every' and 'at intervals of' is subtle, so let's examine both. Because おきに is a suffix, it attaches to numbers, counters, or any 'space' it highlights as an 'interval'.  Even in English, grasping the 'interval' nuance can be tricky.  A helpful way to think of おきに is 'leaving a space of (A), then (B)'. So, 'leaving a space of two days, (B)' clarifies that (B) happens on the third day. \n\n**Important Considerations**\nIt's very common to confuse ごとに and おきに. ごとに literally means 'every'. However, おきに's 'at intervals' meaning creates confusion. おきに itself sometimes means 'every'. Let's explore when they overlap and differ:\n\n* **Large time frames or distances:** Only ごとに expresses 'every'. It's natural to ask 'at what point' within a day, week, or month. Thus, only おきに means 'after an interval of (A)', while ごとに means 'every'.\n* **Small time frames or distances:** Both ごとに and おきに can express 'every'.  It's less important to pinpoint 'at what point' within seconds, minutes, or hours. Here, おきに, highlighting the interval, means 'every interval of one second', etc., because no one asks 'when during the next second' did (B) happen. The one-second space is implied.\n\nIn short, おきに means 'every (A)' for seconds, minutes, hours, millimeters, centimeters, and kilometers. But it means 'with spaces of' for larger units. This isn't an exception; it's a shift in focus as spaces increase. Remember that おきに always points to the beginning of the space *after* (A); it doesn't specify when/where (B) happens afterward. ごとに, conversely, highlights (B) happening *within* (A).\n\n**Example:** 一秒おきに - The space is 'one second'. If おきに points to the start of the next second, the space remains 'one second'.  おきに doesn't care about when (B) occurs within that next second, so we assume immediately. 五年おきに - The space is 'five years'. If おきに points to the start of the sixth year, the space becomes 'six years' because we'd want to know when (B) happens within the sixth year. Assuming immediate action in the new year would be unusual.\n\n**Fun Fact:** This is something native speakers often get wrong, so don't worry if it takes time to understand!  If unsure, consider おきに as 'leaving intervals of (A), then (B)'.  一時間 is the approximate upper time limit where disagreement arises regarding 'every hour' vs. 'every other hour'. This makes sense—it's a short but somewhat long timeframe, making the exact timing within the hour debatable.\n",
  "etymology": "The grammar point \"おきに\" is formed from the noun \"置き\" (oki), meaning \"placing\" or \"interval,\" and the particle \"に\" (ni), indicating location or timing.  The word essentially describes something happening at a set \"placement\" or \"interval.\"  The \"お\" (o) is a polite prefix often added for softening the tone. This structure showcases a common pattern in Japanese grammar where nouns become adverbs or sentence modifiers.",
