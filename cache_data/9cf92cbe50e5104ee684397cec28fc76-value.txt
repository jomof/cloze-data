        "Usage": "Used to introduce additional information related to the previous statement, often as an aside or tangential point."

    "etymology": "The term 「ちなみに」 is derived from the verb 「因む (ちなむ)」, meaning \"to be related to\" or \"to be associated with.\" It suggests a connection or association between the current topic and the information being introduced.",
    "writeup": "「ちなみに」 is a conjunction used to introduce additional, related information that might not be strictly essential but adds context or interest. It's similar to saying \"by the way\" or \"incidentally\" in English. It indicates a slightly tangential connection to the previous statement, offering extra details or a related point. While versatile, overuse can make speech sound rambling; use judiciously to enhance, not distract. It is suitable for both formal and casual conversation.",
