    "etymology": "でしょう is derived from です (the polite form of だ) plus the volitional auxiliary う. Originally, it expressed the speaker's intention, but it evolved to express conjecture or seeking agreement.",
    "writeup": "でしょう is a polite expression used to express **conjecture**, **probability**, or to **seek confirmation** from the listener. It's essentially the polite equivalent of だろう. While it can translate to \"probably\" or \"isn't it?\" in English, it conveys a broader sense of making an assertion while expecting the listener to agree. It's also closely related to でしょ, which is a contracted, more casual form. Though it might sound tentative, using でしょう implies the speaker has some basis for their belief.",
