    "writeup": "The adverb 「そもそも」 expresses the idea of \"in the first place,\" \"to begin with,\" or \"originally.\" It's used to introduce a fundamental point, often implying that there's a problem with the basis of the situation being discussed. When 「の」 is added, it becomes an adjectival noun, modifying a noun to indicate its original or fundamental nature. It can often be translated as \"the very\" or \"original.\"",
    "etymology": "「そもそも」 is believed to have originated from the phrase 「そも」 which meant \"in the first place\" or \"from the beginning.\" The repetition 「そもそも」 intensifies this meaning, emphasizing the fundamental nature of the point being made.",
