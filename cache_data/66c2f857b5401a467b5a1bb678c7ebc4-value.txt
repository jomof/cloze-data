    "writeup": "The grammar point 「に伴って」or「に伴い」, using the て-form of the verb 「伴う」 (tomonaう, 'to accompany') followed by 「に」, expresses that something happens 'as a result of', 'along with', or 'due to' something else. While it indicates a relationship between two events, it doesn't necessarily imply direct causation; rather, it suggests that (A) has a strong influence on the change of (B). It's used for both gradual, progressive changes and sudden events.\n\n「に伴う」 can also directly modify a noun, indicating something associated with that noun. Note that「に伴って」is a bit more common than「に伴い」.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   This grammar is mainly used in formal writing, news reports, and academic contexts.\n*   The nuance is more about things happening in conjunction rather than direct causation.\n*   It's similar to 「につれて」, but 「に伴って」 often implies a stronger connection or impact.",
    "etymology": "The grammar point derives from the verb 「伴う」(tomonaう), meaning \"to accompany.\" The 「に」particle indicates the direction or cause, and the 「て」form connects the verb to indicate a related action or state. So, literally, it means something 'accompanies' or 'occurs with' something else.",
