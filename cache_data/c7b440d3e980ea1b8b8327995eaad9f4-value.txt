  "etymology": "The particle 「と」 derives from the verb 「言う (いう)」, meaning \"to say\". Over time, it grammaticalized to function as a quotative particle, marking direct speech or thoughts.",
  "writeup": "The particle 「と」 functions as a quotation marker, a core concept in Japanese grammar referred to as 「引用 (いんよう)」. This term denotes \"reference\" or \"citation\", signifying that the preceding content is being directly stated, thought, or otherwise communicated. This usage of 「と」 is remarkably flexible, capable of following almost any word, phrase, or clause. A critical nuance to observe is that when the quoted content is a noun or a な-adjective in its plain form, it must be followed by 「だ」 before 「と」. For example, 「学生だと言った」 (said he was a student) or 「元気だと思った」 (thought he was energetic). This 「と」 is nearly always succeeded by a verb that indicates the nature of the 'quote', such as 「言う (いう) - to say」, 「思う (おもう) - to think」, 「書く (かく) - to write」, 「聞く (きく) - to hear/ask」, or 「考える (かんがえる) - to consider/think of something throughly」. However, in certain contexts, particularly at the end of a sentence, the verb may be omitted for brevity. Ultimately, this 「と」 particle precisely establishes the relationship between the communicated content and the manner in which it was conveyed.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "彼 は とても 親切 だ {と} 聞きました。",
      "english": "I heard that he is very friendly.",
      "scene": "An older employee passing along a positive comment they heard about a colleague to a younger intern.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "etymology": "「聞きました」 is the polite past tense form of 「聞く」 (to hear), indicating that this information was received from someone else.",
      "nuance": "This sentence conveys information in a polite and indirect way. The use of 「親切だと聞きました」 (I heard that he is kind) implies that the speaker is sharing information they've acquired, not necessarily a direct personal observation, which is common when an older person advises a younger one."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "メモ に 「私 は 今 から 学校 に 行きます」 {と} 書いた。",
      "english": "I wrote, 'I am going to school now' on a note.",
      "scene": "A young man explaining what he scribbled on a quick note before leaving the house for school, to his girlfriend.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "etymology": "「書いた」 is the plain past tense form of 「書く」 (to write), indicating that the writing action has already occurred.",
      "nuance": "The direct quote 「私 は 今 から 学校 に 行きます」 is precisely what was written, conveying the message verbatim. The casual tone of the sentence, marked by 「書いた」, is suitable for a young man speaking to his girlfriend."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "「彼 は ここ に 来ます か」 {と} 聞いた。",
      "english": "She asked, 'Is he coming here?'",
      "scene": "An older woman reporting a question she asked about a third person to a younger man.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "interrogative",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "etymology": "「聞いた」 is the plain past tense form of 「聞く」 (to ask), indicating that the question has already been posed.",
      "nuance": "The 「か」 particle indicates a question, making the quoted content a direct inquiry. The phrase 「彼 は ここ に 来ます か と 聞いた」 (She asked, 'Is he coming here?') is a neutral, factual report of a question, suitable for conveying information to a younger person without being overly formal."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼女 は 「好きだよ」 {と} 言った。",
      "english": "She said, 'I like you'.",
      "scene": "A young woman confessing her feelings to a young man she is interested in.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",

      "listener_gender": "male",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "etymology": "「言った」 is the plain past tense form of 「言う」 (to say), indicating that the statement has already been made.",
      "nuance": "Using 「好きだよ」 is a casual and intimate way to express affection, and is very common for young female speakers. The 「よ」 particle adds a sense of confirmation or gentle assertion. This phrase 「好きだよと言った」 clearly indicates that these were the direct words spoken, conveying a personal and earnest sentiment."

      "japanese": "田中 さん は 「明日 会いましょう」 {と} 言いました。",
      "english": "Mr. Tanaka said, 'Let's meet tomorrow'.",
      "scene": "A senior colleague reporting a suggestion made by Mr. Tanaka to another senior colleague in a professional setting.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",

      "etymology": "「言いました」 is the polite past tense form of 「言う」 (to say), indicating that the suggestion has already been made.",
      "nuance": "The 「ましょう」 ending is a polite way to suggest or invite someone to do something together. The speaker is reporting what Mr. Tanaka said in a polite, business-appropriate way, using 「言いました」 to maintain a formal register between older colleagues."

    {
      "japanese": "あなた の 笑顔 が とても 美しい {と} 思いました。",
      "english": "I thought your smile was very beautiful.",

      "etymology": "「美しい (うつくしい)」 is an i-adjective meaning beautiful. 「思いました」 is the polite past tense form of 「思う」 (to think).",
      "nuance": "This sentence expresses a personal thought or impression. The polite past tense 「思いました」 (I thought) softens the compliment, making it appropriate for a first meeting. The use of 「あなた」 (you) is direct but softened by the context of a compliment. This structure 「〜と思いました」 is an excellent way to convey a personal, positive impression in a gentle, appreciative manner."

    "violation: Speaker/listener age/gender details were added to all examples to meet the requirements of Rule 6 (speaker/listener gender/age options, at least one of each age/gender).",
    "unnatural: The new example uses `美しい` instead of `素敵` because the kanji for `素敵` (`素`, `敵`) are N1, which is too high for an N5 grammar point's examples, violating the spirit of the JLPT kanji rule. `美しい` uses N3 kanji (`美`), which is appropriate.",
    "violation: `nuance` fields were refined across all examples to accurately reflect the interplay of age/gender and register, and to consistently quote Japanese phrases in 「」 as per Rule 6."
