  "writeup": "The particle 以前 (izen) means \"before\" or \"prior to.\"  However, it carries a stronger implication than simply indicating a point in time.  It suggests that something is so insignificant or insufficient that it's not even worth considering before addressing a more fundamental issue.  Think of it as \"before even considering...\" or \"far from...\" in many contexts.  It often adds a critical or dismissive tone.  以前 attaches directly to nouns, verb dictionary forms, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives.  It's usually followed by に or の, depending on whether it modifies a verb or a noun.  While both 以前 and 前 (mae) mean \"before,\" 以前 emphasizes a greater distance in the past, adding a sense of emphasis and sometimes criticism.  The phrase often highlights a more crucial point that overshadows the initial subject matter.",
