    "etymology": "「なる」means \"to become\" or \"to turn into.\" It is a fundamental verb in Japanese used to express change or transformation. When combined with nouns and adjectives, it specifies what something is changing into. 「に」is a particle indicating direction or result, and 「く」is a conjunctive ending for い-adjectives when they modify verbs.",
    "writeup": "「になる」 (with な-adjectives and nouns) or 「くなる」 (with い-adjectives) expresses that something is in the process of \"becoming\" something. The form of 「なる」 can be changed to reflect different tenses (non-past, continuous, past) or to express negation. For instance, one can say something \"will become,\" \"is becoming,\" or \"has become.\" It's even possible to use negative forms to say something \"will not become\".\n\nWhen used with the 「〜ている」 form, it emphasizes the resulting state rather than the change itself. For example, 「お茶が冷たくなっている」 implies the tea has already become cold and remains cold.\n\n**Important Consideration:** The い-adjective 「いい」 (good) is an exception and conjugates to 「よくなる」, not 「いくなる」.",
