    "writeup": "The verb くれる (呉れる) in Japanese is similar to 与える (to bestow). くれる (primarily written in hiragana) means to \"bestow to the speaker\" (or someone in the speaker's inner circle). In this way, てくれる is the opposite of てあげる, which conveys that someone (usually the speaker) gives (an action) to another person outside of their inner circle.\n\nてくれる is commonly translated as \"would you do (A) for me\" as a question, or \"someone did (A) for me\" as a statement. When asking for a favor, てくれる can be shortened to てくれ. However, this is very casual and should not be used with strangers (or anyone you don't know well).  てくれ sounds like phrases like \"would ya do (A)\" or \"could ya do (A)?\"\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   てくれる is one of the most casual ways to ask for a favor, with てもらう being slightly more polite. ていただく (the humble speech variation of てくれる) is even more polite!",
