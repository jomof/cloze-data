  "writeup": "まで (made) is a particle indicating a limit or extent.  It's attached to nouns and translates variously as 'until,' 'till,' or 'to' (but no further than).  Think of it as specifying a boundary.  Its usage depends heavily on context.  With nouns indicating time, it means 'until' a certain time. With locations, it signifies going 'to' that place and stopping there; it’s similar to に (ni) in this sense.  The nuance shifts slightly when referring to past events, often conveying 'up until' a certain point in the past. Mastering まで requires careful attention to the preceding noun.  It's a fundamental particle crucial for expressing limits and durations.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of まで is complex and not fully understood.  However, it's thought to have evolved from an older form indicating reaching a boundary or limit.  The modern usage as a particle builds on this core meaning of reaching an endpoint.",
