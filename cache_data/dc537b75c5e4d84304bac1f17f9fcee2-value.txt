    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にもとづいて」 comes from the verb 「基づく」(*motozuku*), meaning \"to be based on.\" It combines 「に」 (a particle indicating location or direction), 「基づく」 (the verb), and 「て」 (the *te*-form, used to connect clauses). Thus, it literally means something along the lines of \"being based on [something], and then...\"",
    "writeup": "「にもとづいて」(*ni motozuite*) is used to express that something is \"based on\" something else. Specifically, it indicates that a judgment, conclusion, action, or creation is derived from a particular foundation or source. The structure is:  **(A) にもとづいて (B)**, where (B) is based on (A).\n\nThe kanji 「基」 (*moto*) means \"foundation\", so 「にもとづいて」 often highlights things that stem from something.  It can also be used to indicate things that are produced, created, or invented based on something.",
