    "etymology": "「まだ」 (mada) means \"still\" or \"not yet.\" It modifies the verb phrase formed by 「〜ている」 (te iru), which expresses an ongoing state or action. The negative form 「〜ていません」 (te imasen) or 「〜ていない」 (te inai) then indicates that the state or action has not yet begun or is still not completed.",
    "writeup": "「まだ〜ていません」 combines the adverb 「まだ」 (mada, meaning \"still\" or \"not yet\") with the 「て」 form of a verb, followed by the negative form of 「いる」 (iru), either 「いません」 (imasen, polite) or 「いない」 (inai, plain). This grammar point expresses that something has **not yet** been done or is **still not** in a completed state. Conjugation of the 「て」 form follows standard rules.",
