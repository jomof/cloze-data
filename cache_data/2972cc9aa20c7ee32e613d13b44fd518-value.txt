    "etymology": "「です」 is believed to have originated from the polite auxiliary verb 「ございます」, which is itself a polite form of 「ある」 (to exist, to be). Over time, 「ございます」 was shortened and modified to become the 「です」 we use today as a polite copula.",
    "writeup": "Similar to 「だ」, 「です」 is an auxiliary verb expressing determination or assertion. It states that something 'is' a certain way and is considered the polite equivalent of 「だ」. Although their roles are similar, remember that both 「だ」 and 「です」 are standalone structures.\n\n「です」 connects to words in the same way as 「だ」 but is also regularly attached to the end of い-adjectives. While some consider attaching 「です」 to い-adjectives technically incorrect for formal writing, it is completely normal in daily spoken language or texting.\n\nImportant Consideration:\n\nWhile the example 「暑いです」 is often used, it is considered improper in **formal writing**. Despite this, it has become increasingly common in recent years.",
