    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てはかなわない」 combines 「て」 (a conjunctive particle), 「は」 (an adverbial particle), and 「かなわない」, the negative form of the verb 「叶う (kanau)」, meaning 'to come true' or 'to be realized'. The literal sense is akin to 'it wouldn't do to have (something) come true,' implying the speaker's aversion to the situation.",
    "writeup": "The grammar structure 「てはかなわない」 is used to express that something is undesirable or unbearable. It combines the conjunctive particle 「て」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negative form of the う-Verb 「叶う (kanau)」 meaning 'to grant (a wish)' or 'to realize (a goal)'. A literal translation could be 'it's not a dream come true for (A)'.\n\nWhen used after verbs, the verb is often in the passive form. This indicates that the speaker dislikes being the target or victim of the action. However, standard verb structures can also be used.\n\nIn addition, 「てはかなわない」 can follow the conjunctive form of い-Adjectives or appear as 「ではかなわない」 when following な-Adjectives.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nBe careful not to confuse 「叶う (kanau)」 'to grant' with 「敵う (tekinau)」 'to be a match for'. Grammatically, these verbs are used differently.",
