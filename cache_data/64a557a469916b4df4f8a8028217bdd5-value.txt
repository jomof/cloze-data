    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the combination of 「こと」 (koto, 'thing' or 'matter'), the particle 「に」 (ni, 'in' or 'at'), the particle 「は」 (wa, topic marker), and the negative form of the verb 「なる」 (naru, 'to become'), thus literally meaning 'it does not become that thing/matter'.",
    "writeup": "「ことにはならない」 is used to emphasize that a statement or situation (A) does not necessarily lead to a specific conclusion or result (B). It often follows expressions like 「～からといって」 (karatoitte, 'just because') or 「～ても」 (temo, 'even if'), highlighting that the initial condition does not guarantee the stated outcome. The general structure expresses 'Just because (A), it doesn't mean (B)'. Including 「ということ」 before 「ことにはならない」 can further emphasize the (B) expression.",
