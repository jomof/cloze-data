    "writeup": "The grammar point 「て当然だ」 indicates that something is **natural, obvious, or a matter of course**. It combines the て-form of a verb or い-adjective (or で with nouns) with the noun 「当然」 (touzen), meaning \"naturally.\" This phrase expresses a strong sense of expectation or inevitability. The speaker believes the outcome is justified or to be expected given the circumstances.",
    "etymology": "「当然」 literally means \"of course\" or \"naturally.\" By attaching the te-form to 「当然だ」, it creates a construction where the preceding action or state makes the resulting \"of course\" outcome a logical consequence. The て-form here acts as a connector indicating cause or reason.",
