    "etymology": "The term 「精々」 is said to have originated from the older expression 「精試」 (せいし), meaning \"to completely exhaust all of one's good faith or effort.\" While the original meaning related to exhausting one's good faith is no longer in common use, 「精々」 has retained the sense of exhausting one's capacity, power, or assumptions about something.",
    "writeup": "「精々」 (seizei) is an adverb that conveys the idea of something being \"at the limit,\" \"at most,\" or \"at best.\" It indicates that a certain point or degree is the maximum achievable, often implying that progress beyond that point is impossible due to a physical or metaphorical barrier. It can also express \"no more than,\" especially when there is no apparent barrier, but the speaker believes nothing higher (or lower) is possible. As an adverb, 「精々」 typically appears at the beginning of a sentence or the beginning of the second clause, preceding the element being described as maximal.",
