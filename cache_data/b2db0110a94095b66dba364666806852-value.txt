  "writeup": "や否や, similar to か否か, cleverly utilizes 否 ('no'), an interjection.  However, unlike か否か, which explores 'whether or not (A)', や否や, with や functioning as a conjunction particle, signifies 'as soon as (A)' or 'no sooner than (A)'.  Crucially, や emphasizes the preceding word without restricting its scope.  Therefore, the literal interpretation of や否や is 'at a point when neither (A) nor not (A) could be determined, (B)'.  This construction follows verbs in their dictionary form.  や否や is a formal expression, typically employed when (B) is spontaneous or surprising.  Important Consideration: As や itself implies 'not limited to', you might encounter instances where 否や is omitted.  The meaning remains unchanged; や functions akin to か in mid-sentence questions, conveying 'when uncertain about (A), (B)'.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of や否や lies in the combination of two particles: や and 否や.  や is a conjunction particle indicating immediate succession or simultaneity.  否 is an adverb meaning 'no' or 'not', and や serves to emphasize the preceding clause. The combined effect is to express the immediacy of the second action following the first.",
