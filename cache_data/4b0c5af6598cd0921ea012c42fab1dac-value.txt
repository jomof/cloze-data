    "etymology": "大体 (daitai) is composed of two kanji: 大 (dai), meaning 'big' or 'great', and 体 (tai), meaning 'body' or 'substance'. Therefore, literally, 大体 refers to the 'big substance' or 'main body' of something.  This aligns with its usage to express the main point, the general idea, or the majority of something.",
    "writeup": "「だいたい」 is an adverb with multiple related meanings centered around the idea of the main or essential part. It translates to \"mostly,\" \"generally,\" \"for the most part,\" or \"roughly.\"  Consider it highlighting the **core essence** of a situation or quantity.\n\nIt can modify entire phrases or appear as 「大体の + noun」 before a noun, similar to other adverbs of quantity.  Interestingly, 「だいたい」 can also express the nuance of \"in the first place,\" similar to 「そもそも」. This usage often occurs when expressing dissatisfaction or questioning the premise of a situation.\n\nWhile seemingly different, these meanings share the common thread of referring to what is essentially correct, the most common occurrence, or the original state.  Think of it as representing something without significant alterations, regardless of whether subsequent changes are positive or negative.  You might hear 「だいたい」 used to express a sense of something being \"basically\" correct.",
