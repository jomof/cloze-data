  "pronunciation": {
    "katakana": "ナンバ／アウント＋ワ",
    "romaji": "nanba/aunto + wa",
    "pronunciation_warning": "The pronunciation of \"Number/Amount\" will depend on the specific number or amount used.  'Wa' is the pronunciation of は in this context."
  },
  "etymology": "The use of は after a number or amount isn't derived from a single etymological root but rather from its function as a topic marker and its evolution in signifying a comparative or approximate quantity.  The softening effect of くらい/ぐらい further emphasizes the approximate nature, highlighting the ‘or so’ nuance.  This evolved usage builds upon the inherent flexibility and subtle nuances associated with the は particle.",
  "writeup": "This grammar point uses the particle は after a number or counter (often preceded by くらい or ぐらい) to express an approximate or minimum quantity.  It's not simply 'at least,' but rather conveys a sense of 'around this much, or more,' with an implied comparison to other potential quantities.  This creates a softer, less definite statement compared to using only a precise number.  The implied comparison is key—it suggests the stated amount is significant in the context of potentially larger or smaller amounts. It's commonly used in everyday conversation and carries a standard register.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "毎日、３時間**は**勉強している。",
      "english": "I study for at least 3 hours every day.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses \"毎日\" (mai-nichi) to establish a routine and \"３時間\" (san-jikan) is the highlighted focus.  The \"は\" (wa) implies a possible fluctuation in study time, suggesting that sometimes the speaker studies more than 3 hours, as compared to days they may study less."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "東京には２回**は**行ったことがあるよ。",
      "english": "I've been to Tokyo at least twice.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The \"よ\" (yo) ending signals informality.  The focus is \"２回\" (ni-kai), the minimum number of visits to Tokyo. The use of \"は\" (wa) suggests more trips may have been made."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "１０００円**くらいは**かかると思うよ。",
      "english": "I think it'll cost at least 1000 yen.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The \"くらい\" (kurai) adds a softer, less precise feel.  The \"よ\" (yo) is casual and the use of \"は\" (wa) emphasizes the 1000 yen as a lower bound."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "週末は、彼と２時間**ぐらいは**話したいな。",
      "english": "I want to talk to him for at least two hours this weekend.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of \"な\" (na) at the end is very feminine and gives a soft, sweet feel. The \"ぐらい\"(gurai) softens the 'at least two hours' but also subtly suggests a desire for a longer conversation. 「彼と２時間ぐらいは話したいな」highlights the minimum time in a sweet and flirty manner."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あのレストラン、予約しないと２時間**は**待たされるよ。",
      "english": "At that restaurant, you'll wait at least two hours if you don't make a reservation.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The \"よ\" (yo) denotes a casual register.  \"２時間\" (ni-jikan) is the minimum waiting time, with the \"は\" (wa) implying potentially longer waits."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "５０００円**は**必要です。",
      "english": "At least 5000 yen is necessary.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal ending \"です\" (desu) is used. The emphasis with は (wa) is on the minimum amount needed."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the nuance of ‘at least’ is secondary to the comparative aspect—the highlighted amount is presented within a range of possibilities.  The choice between くらい and ぐらい is largely stylistic; they are virtually interchangeable.  The overall impact hinges on the context and the implied comparison.",

    {
      "term": "は",
      "meaning": "Topic marker; marks the subject of a sentence.",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike Number/Amount + は, which emphasizes a minimum or approximate quantity, は as a topic marker simply introduces the topic of the sentence without implying a comparison to other possible quantities."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the sentence's focus.  If you're highlighting an approximate or minimum quantity, use Number/Amount + は. If you are simply stating a fact or introducing a topic, then the simple topic marker は is appropriate."
