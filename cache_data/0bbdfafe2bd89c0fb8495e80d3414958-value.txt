  "writeup": "The grammar point には及ばない② builds upon the basic には及ばない, expanding its usage and conveying a more nuanced comparison.  It's a sophisticated expression, common in formal settings but adaptable to semi-formal contexts.  This construction combines the particle に (marking the object of comparison), は (topic marker), and the negative form of the verb 及ぶ (obu), meaning \"to reach\" or \"to equal.\"  The literal translation, \"it does not reach,\" understates the actual meaning. The phrase typically implies a significant disparity, often highlighting the superiority of the entity being compared against. The structure usually follows a noun.  Think of it as emphasizing the incomparability or clear inferiority of one thing compared to another, frequently a highly esteemed person or object.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's core, 及ぶ (obu), is an ancient verb tracing back to classical Japanese. Its meaning of \"to reach,\" \"to extend to,\" or \"to amount to\" directly contributes to the comparative sense of には及ばない.  The negative form, combined with the particles に and は, creates a structure that elegantly conveys the insufficient or unequal nature of one thing compared to another.  The use of は emphasizes the topic under discussion.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Note the subtle shifts in meaning depending on context and the addition of adverbs like \"到底 (tōtei) - utterly,\" \"とても (totemo) - very.\" These intensifiers underscore the significant difference being highlighted.  The choice of verb conjugation also subtly affects the nuance of the statement.  Past tense, for instance, reflects a completed comparison; a present tense speaks to an ongoing, perhaps more permanent, difference.",
