    "etymology": "つつ comes from the 連用形 (masu-stem) of the classical verb 「つ」 (tsu), meaning \"to do\".  The repetition implies a continuous or simultaneous action.",
    "writeup": "つつ is a particle attached to the ます-stem of verbs. It indicates that two actions are happening simultaneously. It translates to \"while\" or \"and\" in English. **Important Note:** つつ is considered a formal expression and is more common in writing than in everyday conversation. Unlike ながら, which can be used for both actions and states, つつ is often preferred when the first action is an ongoing state or a less dynamic activity. However, the second action can be either a physical action or a state.",
