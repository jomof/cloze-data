    "writeup": "The adverb 「まだ」 primarily translates to \"still\" or \"not yet,\" depending on the context. Its core meaning revolves around something unexpectedly continuing or not yet being completed. In essence, 「まだ」 implies that a certain condition or action is ongoing when it might be expected to be finished. It can also be used in questions to confirm if something is still happening or in a particular state. 「まだ」 is often repeated as 「まだまだ」 for emphasis, indicating something is lacking or not yet where it needs to be. It's the opposite of 「もう」, which means \"already.\"",
