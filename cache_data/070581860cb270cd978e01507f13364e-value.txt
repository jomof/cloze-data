  "writeup": "The grammar pattern かれ〜かれ pairs with opposite い-adjectives to convey that 'whether (A) or (B), the result will be the same'.  It's usually translated as 'or' or 'either (A) or (B)'.  This structure is a contraction of the conjunctive stem of い-adjectives (く) and the imperative form of the verb ある 'to be' (あれ).  Since い-adjectives lack their own imperative form, くあれ, and then the abbreviation かれ, evolved.  Being imperative, the literal meaning is 'be it (A) or (B)', a declarative statement. かれ〜かれ attaches to the stem of two antonymous adjectives before explaining the consistent outcome regardless of which adjective applies.  Importantly, かれ〜かれ works with a very limited set of adjectives; avoid using it with unfamiliar words.  In the case of 良い 'good' and 悪い 'bad', 悪い is read as 悪しかれ, an archaic form (悪し 'bad') now considered a set phrase. Note that this is a relatively formal and literary construction. ",
  "etymology": "The かれ〜かれ structure originates from a contraction of the く (conjunctive stem of い-adjectives) and あれ (the imperative form of ある, 'to be').  The lack of an inherent imperative form for い-adjectives led to the development of this unique construction.",

      "setting": "Informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal register is evident in the use of です instead of だ.  The sentence provides factual information, suitable for a formal setting like a doctor's advice or a health pamphlet."

    {
      "japanese": "多かれ少なかれ、みんな失敗をするものよ。",

      "setting": "Supportive",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of よ at the end is a softer, more encouraging way to end a sentence, suitable for a semi-formal and supportive conversation, common among female speakers. 「みんな失敗をするものよ」 is a gentle reminder, not a harsh judgment."

      "japanese": "早かれ遅かれ、その秘密は明らかになるだろう。",

      "register": "Standard",
      "setting": "Academic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This example uses かれかれ with the adjectives 好き and 嫌い, and the overall tone is objective and analytical, suitable for academic discussion."

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The casual register is apparent in the use of よ at the end and the contraction of 「する」to「するよ」.  The use of 「君」instead of 「あなた」makes it casual and friendly, a typical male-to-male speech pattern. 「君の選択を尊重するよ」indicates acceptance regardless of the outcome."

      "japanese": "近かれ遠かれ、あなたと一緒ならどこだっていいわ。",
