    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にすぎない」 is derived from 「に」 (a particle indicating purpose or result) and 「過ぎる」 (sugiru, meaning 'to exceed' or 'to go beyond'). The 「ない」 negates 「過ぎる」, creating the meaning of 'not exceeding' or 'not more than'.",
    "writeup": "「にすぎない」 is a common structure in Japanese used for indicating that something is \"no more than (A)\", or \"merely (A)\". This expression is constructed from 「に」, and the negated form of the る-Verb 「過ぎる」, meaning \"to exceed\", or \"to be more than\". Due to this, the literal translation of \"to not be more than (A)\" reflects the English interpretations closely.\n\n「にすぎない」 is slightly formal, but is heard fairly often in day-to-day speech as well. This grammar pattern may be used after verbs in any of their standard forms, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns.\n\n「にすぎない」 is often seen paired with structures that will emphasize the phrase even further, such as 「ただ」 \"merely\" or 「だけ」 \"just\". In the case of 「だけ」, it will come between the target word and 「にすぎない」. Also, standard conjugation rules will need to be remembered, such as adding 「な」 after a な-Adjective before 「だけ」.\n\nFun fact - 「にすぎない」 may occasionally appear in set phrases, such as 「氷山の一角にすぎない」, which means \"to merely be the tip of the iceberg\".",
