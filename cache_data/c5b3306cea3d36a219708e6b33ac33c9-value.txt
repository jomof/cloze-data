  "writeup": "The adverbial particle あまりに (amarini) signifies an excessive degree or quantity, often leading to a consequence.  It's frequently used to express surprise or shock at the extent of something.  While sometimes translated as 'so much...that' or 'way too much...', thinking of it as 'excessively...resulting in...' might be more intuitive, aligning closer to its literal meaning of 'excessively'.  The particle に (ni) intensifies the excessiveness.  Note that the colloquial variant あんまり (annmari) is common in casual speech but should be avoided in formal settings.  It's important to remember to use あまりに, and not あまり, when it expresses the meaning of 'excessively'.",
  "etymology": "あまりに derives from あまり (amari), meaning 'excess' or 'remainder,' combined with the particle に (ni), which indicates the extent or degree.  The combination thus signifies an excessive degree to the point of causing a certain result.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "今日の仕事は**あまりに**楽過ぎた。",
      "english": "Today's work was way too easy.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a casual register appropriate for personal reflection.  The use of 「過ぎた」(sugita) emphasizes the extreme ease of the work."

      "japanese": "今朝は会社に**あまりに**遅く着いたため、上司に叱られた。",
      "english": "I arrived at the office way too late this morning, so my boss scolded me.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The semi-formal register suits a situation where one is explaining a mistake and apologizing.  The phrase 「上司に叱られた」(jōshi ni shikarareta) indicates a formal relationship with the boss. The use of 「ため」(tame) signifies the causal link between lateness and the reprimand."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の優しさは**あまりに**完璧で、思わず涙がこぼれた。",
      "english": "His kindness was so perfect, I couldn't help but cry.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "sympathetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register is fitting for expressing personal emotion.  The phrase 「思わず涙がこぼれた」(omowazu namida ga koboreta) paints a vivid picture of involuntary tears, conveying a strong emotional response to the kindness."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼女の美しさは**あまりに**眩しくて、目をそらしたくなった。",
      "english": "Her beauty was so dazzling, I felt like I had to look away.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This flirty sentence uses a casual register, appropriate for informal interactions.  The use of 「眩しくて」(mabushikute) conveys the intensity of the speaker's feeling, intensifying the flirtatious nuance.  The phrase 「目をそらしたくなった」(me wo sorashita ku natta) suggests a slight shyness or being overwhelmed."

    {
      "japanese": "彼の冗談は**あまりに**下品で、皆が顔をしかめた。",
      "english": "His joke was so vulgar that everyone frowned.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register and the descriptive phrase 「下品で」(gehin de) indicate the speaker is sharing an observation about a humorous but distasteful situation. The word 「皆」(minna) shows that the reaction wasn't limited to the speaker alone.  The phrase 「顔をしかめた」(kao wo shikameta) illustrates the common reaction to the inappropriate joke."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の態度は**あまりに**傲慢で、取引を中断せざるを得なかった。",
      "english": "His attitude was so arrogant that we had no choice but to suspend the negotiations.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "negotiating",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal register is appropriate for a professional setting describing a serious problem.  The sentence structure 「～せざるを得なかった」(sezaru o eta nakatta) emphasizes the lack of alternative options. The phrase 「傲慢で」(gōman de) is a very direct way of describing someone's behavior in a negative way."

      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While both すぎる (sugiru) and あまりに (amarini) express excessiveness, すぎる is more straightforward and often describes a simple excess, while あまりに usually implies a degree of surprise or consequence."

    {
      "term": "なかなか",
      "meaning": "Very, Quite, Considerably",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, carefully consider the context.  あまり (amari) indicates insufficiency, while あまりに (amarini) signifies excess leading to a consequence.  すぎる (sugiru) is a simpler way to express 'too much', focusing on the degree itself rather than a resulting consequence.  The choice between these depends on the specific nuance you want to convey."
