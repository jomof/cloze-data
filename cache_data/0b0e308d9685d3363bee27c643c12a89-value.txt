        "Structure": "Noun + をよそに; Nominalized phrase + のをよそに"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「をよそに」 is derived from 「余所(よそ)」, meaning 'another place' or 'somewhere else'. The 「を」 here is the adverbial particle and 「に」 is a case-marking particle. The literal sense is akin to 'putting something aside, as if it's happening in another place'.",
    "writeup": "「をよそに」 is used to express indifference or disregard towards something. It indicates that a person is ignoring certain warnings, criticisms, advice, or circumstances while proceeding with a particular action. This grammar point is reasonably formal and is more often seen in writing. It is a combination of the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「余所」 ('another place'), and the case-marking particle 「に」. The structure typically follows a noun or a phrase nominalized with 「の」. Often, it carries a critical tone, implying that the action being taken is irresponsible given the circumstances. Note that 「をよそに」 is used to describe the actions of others, not oneself.",
