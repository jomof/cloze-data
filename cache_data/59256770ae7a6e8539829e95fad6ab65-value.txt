  "writeup": "The grammar point \"Verb + てもいい\" allows you to express permission or acceptance.  It literally translates to \"doing [verb] is also good.\"  It's a versatile phrase, usable as a statement or a polite question. While often used with the も (also), omitting it makes the expression more direct, suitable for close relationships.  Remember that the て-form is essential; some verbs use で instead of て.  Mastering this requires understanding te-form verb conjugations.",
  "etymology": "This construction arises from the combination of the te-form of a verb, indicating a completed action or state, and いい (ii), meaning 'good' or 'okay'. The particle も (mo) adds emphasis, signifying that the action is permissible in addition to other possibilities. The overall structure reflects the Japanese emphasis on politeness and indirectness in expressing requests or permissions.",

    {
      "false_friend": "てもいい",
      "nuance": "While similar, \"てもいい\" emphasizes the acceptability of an action, whereas \"Verb + てもいい\" implies a suggestion or request for permission."
    },
    {

      "nuance": "Unlike \"Verb + てもいい,\"  \"てもかまわない\" focuses on lack of objection rather than explicit permission or acceptance."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that \"てもいい\" is a more concise way to express permission and often sounds more natural than \"verb + てもいい\" in informal situations. \"てもかまわない\" implies indifference rather than explicit permission, so use it only when you want to state that you don't mind rather than when you are actively giving someone permission."
