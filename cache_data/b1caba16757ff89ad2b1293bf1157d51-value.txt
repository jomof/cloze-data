  "writeup": "それとも is a versatile conjunction in Japanese often translated as 'or,' 'or else,' or 'rather.'  It presents a choice between two options, typically presented as (A) and (B), implying that the choice is limited to these two.  Understanding its nuanced usage is key.  It's built from それ (sore - that), と (to - and), and も (mo - also).  Its placement varies; it can follow a comma or initiate a new sentence.  While often used for contrasting options, this isn't mandatory.  Mastering それとも elevates your ability to express choices naturally in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The word それとも is a combination of three particles: それ (sore, meaning 'that'), と (to, meaning 'and'), and も (mo, meaning 'also' or 'too').  The combination creates a meaning of 'that and also,' implying an alternative choice.",
