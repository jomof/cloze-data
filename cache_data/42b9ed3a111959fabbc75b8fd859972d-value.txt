    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずにはいられない」 is composed of several elements. 「ず」 is the negative form of a verb, often used in literary or formal contexts. 「に」 is a case-marking particle. 「は」 is a contrastive topic marker. 「いられない」 is the negative potential form of the verb 「いる」 (to be/exist). Literally, it translates to \"cannot be in a state of not doing,\" conveying the idea that one cannot help but do something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ずにはいられない」 expresses the idea that one **cannot help but do something** or **cannot resist doing something**. It conveys a feeling of inevitability or strong desire. It's a more formal way of expressing this idea. The 「ず」 part is the archaic negative auxiliary verb, similar to 「ない」, and it always attaches to the 未然形 (mizenkei - imperfective form) of the verb. For verbs ending in 「る」, like 食べる (taberu - to eat), the 未然形 is 食べ (tabe). For verbs ending in 「う」, you change the 「う」 to the corresponding 「あ」 sound, so 書く (kaku - to write) becomes 書か (kaka). However, for する (suru - to do), the 未然形 is せ. Therefore, する becomes せずにはいられない.  The 「にはいられない」 part literally means \"cannot be in a state of not doing\". This grammar point often expresses a natural reaction or something that is difficult to control.",
