  "writeup": "The grammar point \"を前提に\" (wo jōten ni) is a sophisticated expression used to indicate the underlying assumption or premise upon which something else is based.  It literally translates to \"on the premise of.\"  The structure combines the particle を (o), marking the direct object, the noun 前提 (jōten, meaning 'premise' or 'assumption'), and the particle に (ni), indicating a condition or circumstance.  This construction is frequently found in formal settings and academic writing.  The nuance shifts subtly depending on whether こと (koto, nominalized verb) is used or not.  Using こと emphasizes the action or event as the premise, whereas using a noun directly puts emphasis on the situation or state. It's crucial to understand that the premise expressed by \"を前提に\" is often unspoken, yet fundamental to understanding the main clause. ",

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the nuance shifts subtly depending on the context and the verb or noun used.  Remember that the premise is often implied and needs to be inferred from the situation.  Mastering this grammar point elevates your Japanese to a more sophisticated level.",
  "etymology": "前提 (jōten) itself is derived from the verb 前提する (jōten suru), meaning \"to premise\" or \"to assume.\"  The structure reflects the inherent logic of stating a premise before presenting a conclusion or action. The use of を and に demonstrates the grammatical evolution of indicating a condition or assumption within a sentence structure.  It's a sophisticated example of how particles work together to convey subtle but important distinctions in meaning.",
