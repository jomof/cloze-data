  "writeup": "The Japanese expression ないことはない (nai koto wa nai) is a nuanced way of saying something isn't impossible or that the absence of something doesn't mean its complete impossibility.  It literally translates to something like \"it's not that there's no such thing,\" but this direct translation is not idiomatic in English.  The key is the double negative; it conveys a possibility, but often with a subtle implication of difficulty, reluctance, or unlikelihood. This structure works with the negative form of verbs, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives.  The core component, ことはない (koto wa nai), emphasizes the absence of a situation.  Adding ない (nai) creates the double negative, suggesting possibility.  Interestingly, ないことはない often pairs with potential verbs, implying a lack of effort or a half-hearted approach. This is akin to saying 'it's not like I can't' in English, suggesting capability but a lack of motivation.",
  "etymology": "The etymology is straightforward.  It's a combination of ない (nai, not), こと (koto, thing/situation), は (wa, topic marker), and ない (nai, not). The double negative structure is common in Japanese to soften statements or express nuanced meanings.",

For a softer, more nuanced indication of possibility, despite challenges, ないことはない is the appropriate choice.  Remember that while  ～ない～はない and とは限らない  are synonyms,  ないことはない is generally more natural in everyday conversation."
