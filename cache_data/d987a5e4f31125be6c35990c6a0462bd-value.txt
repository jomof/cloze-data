    "writeup": "The adverb **一体 (ittai)** is used to express a sense of surprise, doubt, or disbelief, often in the context of a question. It conveys a feeling similar to \"what the heck,\" \"who in the world,\" \"where on earth,\" or even an emphatic \"how many f\*ing...\"  It's typically placed at the beginning of a sentence or clause, right before the question word (like 何, 誰, いつ, どこ, etc.).\n\n**Etymology:** The literal meaning of 一体 is \"one body\" or \"one entity.\"  Thinking about this etymology can help understand its usage. When you ask a question with 一体, you are essentially saying, \"In a way that makes logical sense as one coherent thing, what is...?\".  You're emphasizing your inability to understand or believe the situation.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   While the input mentions 一体に meaning \"in general,\" this usage is less common now and primarily functions as a way to express surprise or disbelief in questions.\n*   一体 adds a strong emotional emphasis to the question, indicating the speaker's strong feelings of confusion or incredulity.",
