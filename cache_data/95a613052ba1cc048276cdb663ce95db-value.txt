  "writeup": "The particle 以来 (irai) means \"since\" or \"henceforth.\"  It's used with a preceding noun phrase or a verb in the て-form to indicate a continuous state or action that began at a specific point in the past and continues to the present, or will continue into the future.  Think of it as signifying an uninterrupted continuation.  Unlike から (kara), which simply marks a starting point, 以来 emphasizes the *unbroken* nature of the duration.  Therefore, it's particularly suited for describing habits, conditions, or situations that have persisted without interruption.  Important Consideration:  While sometimes used to express a cumulative number of events since a past point, the core emphasis remains on the ongoing, uninterrupted nature of the state or action. This nuance makes it unsuitable for expressing recently completed actions or very short time periods. It is generally used in standard speech, and there are no significant regional or gender-specific variations in its usage.",
  "etymology": "以来 (irai) combines 以 (i), meaning \"by means of,\" or \"by way of,\" and 来 (rai), meaning \"coming.\"  Together, they suggest something that \"comes after\" or \"follows from\" a specific starting point, implying continuity.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "２年前にタバコをやめて**以来**、一本も吸ってない。",
      "english": "I haven't smoked a single cigarette since I quit two years ago.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses a casual register, evident in the plain form of the verb 吸ってない (sutteinai).  The setting is informative, simply stating a fact. There's no specific gender or age nuance."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "日本に来て**以来**、ずっと日本語を勉強している。",
      "english": "I've been studying Japanese ever since I came to Japan.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence employs a casual register, marked by the plain form of the verb 勉強している (benkyou shiteiru). The statement is straightforward and factual, without specific gender or age implications."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "卒業**以来**、彼とは一度も会っていない。",
      "english": "I haven't seen him since graduation.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses a slightly more formal register compared to the first example.  The absence of overt formality suggests a semi-formal tone.  The gender and age of the speakers are not directly indicated."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼と付き合って**以来**、毎日が幸せです。",
      "english": "Every day has been wonderful since I started going out with him.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The polite です (desu) ending makes this suitable for a polite conversation, and the overall tone is clearly flirty. The use of 「毎日が幸せです」(mainichi ga shiawase desu) is appropriate for a female speaker expressing such feelings."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの日から**以来**、君のことをずっと考えているんだ。",
      "english": "I've been thinking about you ever since that day.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「んだ」(nda), a particle indicating a soft, intimate assertion.  This conveys a close and personal connection, appropriate for an early romantic context. The use of 「君」(kimi) is suitable for a male speaker in such a setting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "会社に入社して**以来**、昇進の機会は一度もなかった。",
      "english": "I've never had a promotion opportunity since I joined the company.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal register is reflected in the use of the plain past negative form なかった (nakatta). The setting is clearly serious and potentially somewhat resentful."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the key to using 以来 effectively lies in understanding its emphasis on continuous, unbroken duration. It's not about just marking a starting point, but highlighting the persistence of the state or action from that point.  Therefore, ensure the context supports the idea of an uninterrupted continuation.",

    {
      "term": "以上 ②",
      "meaning": "Since, Now that, As long as, If",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike 以来, which emphasizes continuous duration, 以上 ② can also mark a point in time initiating something new, not necessarily a continuous state."

    {
      "term": "上は",
      "meaning": "Once, Since, Now that, As long as",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "上は (ue wa) is a more versatile term; while it can express 'since,' it doesn't carry the same strong implication of continuous action as 以来."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the nuance of uninterrupted continuation inherent in 以来.  If your sentence focuses on the beginning of a new state or doesn't explicitly emphasize the ongoing nature, 以上 ② or 上は might be more appropriate.  Carefully analyze the context to choose the most fitting particle."
