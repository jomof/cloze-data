  "writeup": "The suffix たて, derived from the verb 立てる (tatsu - to stand), transforms verbs into nouns, indicating that something has \"just been finished\" or is \"freshly finished.\"  It's often used after the conjunctive form of verbs.  Think of it as capturing the immediate moment *after* completion, emphasizing the freshness.  Because of this focus on immediacy, たて is most frequently paired with verbs describing things that degrade in quality over time.  For example, freshly baked bread is superior to day-old bread.  たて can be followed by a phrase or directly by the particle の and a noun.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of たて is fascinating.  It's directly related to the verb 立てる (tateteru), meaning 'to stand up' or 'to erect.'  The nuance here is subtle but powerful.  Imagine something freshly made—it's not just finished; it's standing proudly, fresh and new, in its completion. The suffix captures this immediate, upright, and vibrant state.",
