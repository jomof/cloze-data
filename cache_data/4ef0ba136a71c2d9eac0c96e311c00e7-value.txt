  "writeup": "The particle つ (tsu) in the structure つ〜つ is a fascinating conjunction that links two contrasting verbs, creating a sense of repetitive, alternating actions.  Think of it as \"doing A, then B, then A, then B,\" and so on.  This isn't a common structure in modern Japanese, and you'll mainly see it in set phrases.  The verbs are typically in their conjunctive form.  A special case involves repeating the same verb; the first instance remains in its base form, while the second appears in the passive form, indicating a back-and-forth or reciprocal action.  Mastering this requires memorization of the common phrases, as creating new ones is highly unusual.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of つ〜つ isn't easily isolated to a single source. The particle つ itself has a long history in Japanese grammar, evolving from older forms indicating connection or continuation.  Its use in this specific repetitive structure appears to be a fossilized grammatical pattern, solidified through repeated usage in set expressions over centuries.",
