    "etymology": "その (sono) means \"that,\" and ため (tame) means \"reason\" or \"purpose.\" The particle に (ni) indicates direction or purpose, but is often omitted. Therefore, そのため(に) literally means \"for that reason\" or \"for that purpose.\"",
    "writeup": "そのために is a frequently used conjunction in Japanese. It combines その, the noun ため meaning \"reason\" or \"purpose\" (sometimes written as 為), and the case-marking particle に. そのために translates as \"for that reason\" or \"to that end.\" It introduces a new sentence that explains the result or purpose related to the previous sentence.\n\n*   に is often omitted.\n*   ため is similar to \"sake\" in English, often used for goals or positive outcomes, but can also highlight unfortunate results.\n*   為 is a flexible kanji with meanings like \"to put to use,\" emphasizing the resulting state or outcome.",
