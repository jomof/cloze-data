    "etymology": "ますます originates from the stacking of 増す (masu), a verb meaning 'to increase.' This doubling emphasizes the increasing nature of something.",
    "writeup": "The adverb ますます means \"increasingly,\" \"more and more,\" or \"to keep (A)ing.\" It emphasizes continuous trends and often appears at the beginning of a sentence. The kanji form 益々 is sometimes used, but the nuance remains the same; 益 simply means \"gain.\" Because ますます comes from stacking 増す, it's often used with verbs indicating change or adjectives that can increase in intensity.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nWhile ますます can sometimes be translated as \"less and less,\" it still implies an *increasingly* negative situation.",
