    "etymology": "The expression 「〜てもいい」 is composed of 「〜て」 (the te-form of a verb, indicating a connection or sequence), 「も」 (particle indicating 'even if'), and 「いい」 (meaning 'good'). Thus, the literal breakdown is something like \"even if you do [verb], it is good,\" which evolves into the meaning of permission or allowance.",
    "writeup": "The 「Verb[て]+もいい」 construction expresses permission, indicating that something is 'okay' or 'alright' to do. It can also be phrased as a question to ask for permission, such as \"Can I do this?\" or \"May I do this?\".\n\nOmitting the 「も」 makes the expression more direct and casual, which is acceptable among close friends. The phrase literally means 「て (verb) も (also) いい (is good)」.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Remember that some verbs use 「で」 instead of 「て」 in their te-form, based on the verb's ending.",
