  "etymology": "The past tense form 「た」 originates from the auxiliary verb 「たり」 in classical Japanese. 「たり」 indicated completed action or perfective aspect. Over time, 「たり」 evolved into 「た」 and became the standard past tense marker for verbs.",
  "writeup": "To form the past tense of a る-verb, remove the 「る」 from the dictionary form of the verb and add 「た」 for the casual past tense, or 「ました」 for the polite past tense. 「ました」 is actually 「ます」 conjugated with 「た」, where 「ます」 adds politeness and 「た」 indicates the past tense. 「た」 has multiple meanings, including past tense (happened in the past), completion (action is finished), and continuation (a new state continues).",
