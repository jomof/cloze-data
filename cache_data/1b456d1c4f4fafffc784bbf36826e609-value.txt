        "Register": "Written and formal speech",
        "Formation": "- い-adjective (remove い) + くなく\n- な-adjective/Noun + ではなく",
        "Nuance": "Indicates a reason or cause for what follows when attached to an adjective (い or な), and indicates a contrast when attached to a noun + copula."

    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the continuative form of the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」. 「ない」 indicates negation, and 「なく」 functions to connect two clauses by indicating that the first clause is not the case.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なく」 is used in formal writing and speech to connect two clauses by indicating negation. It translates to \"not ~ and\" or \"not ~ but\". It is primarily used to express a reason or cause when attached to an adjective, and to express a contrast when attached to a noun. 「なく」 is a literary expression and is less common in everyday conversation.\n\n*   **い-adjectives:** Drop the い and add 「くなく」 (e.g., 高い → 高くなく).\n*   **な-adjectives/Nouns:** Use 「ではなく」 (e.g., 静か → 静かではなく, 学生 → 学生ではなく).",
