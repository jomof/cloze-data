  "writeup": "ようではないか is a construction primarily used for suggesting mutual activities. It combines the auxiliary verb よう (expressing will or intent, similar to 'shall' in English), ではない (the negative form of だ), and the sentence-ending particle か.  The literal translation resembles 'shall we not do (A)?', but it's more naturally understood as 'Let's do (A)' or 'Why don't we do (A)?'.  ようではないか is attached to the verb indicating the suggested action.  The abbreviated form じゃない can sometimes replace ではない, but  ようではないか is typically formal, often using the unabbreviated form or the even more polite ようではありませんか. Interestingly, it's occasionally preceded by もらう, subtly challenging the listener: 'Why don't I have *you* do (A) then?' This nuance adds a layer of indirectness, making it a versatile tool for suggestions and gentle challenges.",
  "etymology": "This phrase's structure reveals its formal nature.  The use of the negative form ではない, followed by か, creates a polite and indirect suggestion rather than a direct command.  The inclusion of よう adds a sense of mutual agreement and collaboration to the proposed action.",
