    "etymology": "じゃない is a contraction of では + ない (the negative form of です or だ). では in turn is a particle combination of で + は.",
    "writeup": "じゃない is the casual form of ではない. では is often contracted to じゃ in Japanese, so it's worth remembering as its own structure. じゃない (casual) or ではない (semi-polite) are used to form the negative of nouns and な-adjectives. You simply add them to the base form of the noun or な-adjective.\n\nじゃ and では can also be used with the negative ます form of ある to create a polite variant. ない is sometimes said/written as ね or ねえ. However, this is considered very casual, or even a bit rough, so it's best to avoid it in most conversations.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   じゃない is frequently used to ask questions, similar to じゃないか. However, じゃない as a question is more direct, like \"isn't it?\" in English, whereas じゃないか is more like \"don't you think?\"\n*   When じゃない is used as a question, it's usually obvious due to a rising intonation.",
