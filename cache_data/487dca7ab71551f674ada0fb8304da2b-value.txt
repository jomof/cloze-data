  "writeup": "こととて is a fascinating grammatical construction combining the noun こと (koto, 'thing') and the binding particle とて (tote).  It's used to express a reason or cause, translating to 'due to,' 'since,' 'on account of,' or 'because.'  This expression leans heavily towards formality, appearing almost exclusively in written Japanese, particularly in more classical or literary styles.  It carries a certain weight and is not typically used in everyday conversation.  The nuance often implies an apology or explanation for an undesirable outcome.  Therefore, you'll frequently encounter こととて following past tense verbs or negated verbs (using ない or ぬ), emphasizing an action that shouldn't have happened or one that was omitted but should have been performed.  The cause expressed by こととて often leads to an obvious or expected negative consequence.  Its etymology is somewhat debated, with theories suggesting it's a combination of the particle と (to) and て (te), or a derivation from the classical auxiliary verb たり (tari).  However, understanding its modern usage is more practical than delving into these etymological uncertainties.",
