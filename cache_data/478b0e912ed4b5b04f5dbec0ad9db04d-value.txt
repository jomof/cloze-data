    "etymology": "The term 「う-verb」 refers to verbs that end with a 「う」 sound in their dictionary form. The 「dictionary form (辞書形)」 is so-called because it is the form in which the verb appears in a dictionary.",
    "writeup": "う-Verbs encompass all Japanese verbs ending in 「う」 sounds, including some ending in 「る」. These are termed Godan (五段, \"five-level\") verbs because their conjugations utilize all five sounds within the same column (段) as their base form.\n\nFor instance, in the example 「聞く」, the 「く」 changes to 「き」 when conjugated to the polite form, 「聞きます」. All sounds in the K-column will be used with 「聞く」 depending on the conjugation. The same principle applies to all う-Verbs:\n\n*   「聞(か)ない」 (negative)\n*   「聞(き)たい」 (desire)\n*   「聞(く)」 (dictionary)\n*   「聞(け)る」 (potential)\n*   「聞(こ)う」 (volitional)\n\nHere we can see the う-Verb 「聞く」 using all of the different K-column sounds in various conjugations.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The base form of the verb may be called \"plain form\", \"casual form\", or \"short form\", depending on the context or source material.",
