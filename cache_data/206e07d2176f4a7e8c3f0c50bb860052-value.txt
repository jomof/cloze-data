    "etymology": "The suffix 「げ」 is derived from the noun 「気(き)」, which means 'spirit,' 'mood,' or 'feeling.' Thus, 「げ」 implies that something *appears* to possess a certain quality or emotion, based on outward signs or impressions.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「げ」, sometimes written as 「気」, expresses that something 'gives off the feeling of (A)' or 'seems like (A).' It's frequently used with emotions, feelings, and things the speaker isn't 100% certain about because they aren't directly visible. 「げ」 is mainly used after the stem form of い-adjectives but can also follow the stem form of な-adjectives and nouns. Adding 「げ」 creates a new な-adjective meaning '(A) seeming'. This can be followed by either 「な」 or 「に」, depending on whether it modifies a noun or a verb later in the sentence.\n\nImportant considerations:\n\n*   「げ」 is more subjective than 「そう」 and indicates low confidence. It reflects the speaker's impression or 'sense' of something, regardless of its internal reality.\n*   Since 「げ」 turns adjectives and nouns into な-adjectives, you must use 「～げな」 to modify a noun, and 「～げに」 to modify a verb.",
