  "writeup": "The grammar point \"てくる\" combines the te-form of a verb with the verb くる (kuru, to come).  It indicates an action that develops gradually or begins to happen, often implying a change of state. Think of it as \"to come to do\" or \"to begin to.\"  The nuance differs from ていく (teiku), which suggests a continuing action extending into the future.  For example,  \"太ってくる (ふとってくる)\" means \"to begin to get fat,\" while \"太っていく (ふとっていく)\" means \"to continue getting fat.\"  The focus is on the *process* of coming to a state, not merely the state itself.  This grammatical structure is versatile and commonly used in everyday speech, suitable for most contexts.",
  "etymology": "てくる is a combination of the te-form (a verb stem) and くる (kuru), meaning 'to come'. The meaning develops from the image of an action approaching the speaker or situation.",
