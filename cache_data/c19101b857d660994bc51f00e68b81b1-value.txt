  "writeup": "The particle phrase を限りに (wo kagiri ni) follows a noun to indicate a point in time when something that was ongoing will conclude.  It's often translated as \"as of (the end of)\", \"starting from (and ending with)\", \"no longer after (this point)\", or \"by (the)\".  This structure uses the adverbial particle を (wo), the noun 限り (kagiri, meaning 'limit'), and the particle に (ni).  を限りに is frequently used in formal announcements or proclamations and is generally considered more formal than similar expressions like 限りで (kagiri de).  While it usually follows time or place words viewed temporally, there's an exception: 声を限りに (koe wo kagiri ni), meaning 'to the limit of one's voice,' shows that  a temporal restriction isn't strictly enforced in all cases. This is a nuance worth noting.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of を限りに (wo kagiri ni) is straightforward.  It combines the particle を (wo), indicating the subject or object of the action; 限り (kagiri), meaning 'limit' or 'extent,' derived from the verb 限りる (kagiriru), meaning 'to limit'; and に (ni), a particle indicating time or purpose.  The overall meaning, therefore, centers on the idea of a boundary or limit in time.",

      "setting": "Informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a straightforward and polite tone, suitable for a general announcement.  The use of \"明日\" (ashita, tomorrow) clearly indicates the specific time limit."

    {
      "japanese": "今月末を限りに、私は会社を辞めます。",
      "english": "I'm leaving the company at the end of this month.",
      "register": "Semi-formal",

    {
      "japanese": "来月を限りに、彼との交際を終わらせることにしました。",

      "register": "Semi-formal",
      "setting": "Reflective",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The choice of を限りに(wo kagiri ni) adds a sense of finality to the decision, suggesting a deliberate and considered action. The speaker is female; using \"彼\" (kare, him) instead of a more affectionate term keeps the tone somewhat distant, reflecting emotional detachment."

    {
      "japanese": "今夜のライブを限りに、このバンドは解散します。",
      "english": "This band is disbanding after tonight's live performance.",

      "setting": "Reflective",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of  「つもりです」(tsumori desu) softens the declaration of intent slightly, and the addition of 「もう限界なんだ…」 (mou genkai nan da...) adds personal feelings. The sentence is casual, and emotionally charged, which is suitable for a close friend."

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence is extremely intimate and flirty, using the direct possessive phrase 「私のものにしたい」(watashi no mono ni shitai). The phrasing is suggestive, making it unsuitable for formal contexts."

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while を限りに is generally used for formal situations, the level of formality can be adjusted based on the surrounding context.  The key is the finality implied:  this point marks the end of something continuous.",
