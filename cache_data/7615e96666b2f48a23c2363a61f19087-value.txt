    "etymology": "「に応えて」 is formed from the particle 「に」 and the て-form of the verb 「応える(こたえる)」, which means \"to respond,\" \"to meet (expectations),\" or \"to live up to.\" The particle 「に」 indicates the target or recipient of the action. Therefore, 「に応えて」 literally means \"having responded to\" and is used to express that an action is taken as a result of something.",
    "writeup": "「に応えて」 is constructed using the particle 「に」 and the て-form of the verb 「応える (こたえる)」. It translates to \"in response to\" or \"to meet (expectations, needs, etc.)\". Similar to 「に応じて」, 「に応えて」 indicates that action (B) is taken based on what is deemed necessary or appropriate in relation to (A). It often appears in hiragana. The particle 「に」 marks the noun (A) that the response is directed towards. 「に応える」 can also be used directly before another noun. Often, (A) represents a request, wish, expectation, or demand.",
