    "writeup": "っこない is a combination of the suffix **っこ** and the い-Adjective **ない**. When attached to the **conjunctive form (masu-stem)** of verbs, it creates new い-Adjectives that express the impossibility of that verb's action. Common translations of っこない include \"there is no chance of (doing something)\" or \"doing (something) is impossible.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   While extremely rare, as っこ stems from the kanji 子, this grammar point may occasionally be seen in its kanji form: 子ない. It's best to recognize this but stick to the hiragana form in your own writing.\n*   The nuance is one of strong conviction that something is simply not possible, often with a sense of resignation or obviousness.",
