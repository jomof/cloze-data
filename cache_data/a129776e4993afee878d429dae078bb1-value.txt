  "writeup": "ことだし (koto dashi) is a nuanced expression combining the noun こと (koto, 'thing'), the auxiliary verb だ (da), and the conjunction particle し (shi).  It's used to list reasons, often translating simply as 'because' or 'since,' but with a crucial difference: it emphasizes that the stated reason is one among others. This implies 'while there are other reasons, this one is sufficient.' The structure typically follows a word in its attributive form or a noun followed by の (no).  The し (shi) highlights the non-exclusivity of the reason, suggesting that other factors contribute, but this reason justifies the subsequent action or statement.  It's frequently used to soften a suggestion, invitation, or expression of resolve.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of ことだし is straightforward.  こと (koto) means 'thing' or 'matter,'  だ (da) is the copula, and し (shi) is a conjunction particle indicating addition or continuation. The combination creates a structure that implies a cumulative reasoning process, where the final reason (こと) is presented as a sufficient, though not necessarily sole, justification.",
