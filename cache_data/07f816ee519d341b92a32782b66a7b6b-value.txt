  "writeup": "に則って/に則り is a formal expression used when something is done 'according to (A)', or 'in line with (A)'.  This usually refers to a basis, foundation, or standard with a long history.  The particle に combines with the て-form (or た-form) of the -う verb 則る, \"to follow along with\". Literally, it means (B) follows (A).  The most common forms are a noun followed by のに則って or のに則った, modifying a second noun. Both kanji and hiragana forms are common.  (A) generally represents something foundational, often a law, tradition, standard, or code of conduct—something with an established, enduring origin.",
  "etymology": "The verb 則る (noru) itself is derived from ancient Chinese (漢語, kango) and has roots in the concept of following established rules or norms. Its usage reflects the importance of adherence to precedents and established order in Japanese culture.",
