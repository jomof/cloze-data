    "writeup": "もう is typically translated as \"already\" or \"anymore,\" depending on the sentence's context. The nuance behind もう is that something has unexpectedly ended. Therefore:\n\n*   In a past-tense sentence, it means something was expected *not* to be done, but it *is* done. Hence, \"already.\"\n*   In a negative sentence, it means something was expected to still be happening, but it is *not*. Hence, \"anymore.\"\n\nもう can also be used in questions, suggesting the speaker believes something *might* have ended but wants confirmation.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   もう contrasts with まだ, which means \"something is unexpectedly still going.\"\n*   もう can express exasperation, indicating one has reached a point of not wanting to continue.",
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「もう」 is complex and debated, with roots potentially tracing back to ancient words indicating \"again\" or \"further.\" Over time, it evolved to encompass the sense of something being completed or exceeding expectations, hence its current usage implying \"already\" or \"anymore.\"",
