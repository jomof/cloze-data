  "writeup": "大体 (daitai) is an adverb used to express the general idea, main point, or approximate amount of something.  It often translates as \"mostly,\" \"generally,\" \"for the most part,\" \"roughly,\" or \"approximately.\"  Its versatility allows it to modify entire phrases or precede a noun, forming phrases like 大体の + noun (daitai no + noun), meaning \"most of the\" or \"roughly the.\"  Interestingly, it can also mean \"in the first place,\" similar to そもそも (somosomo). This usage often emphasizes an initial expectation that was unmet.  While seemingly disparate, both primary uses share the underlying concept of expressing what's essentially or fundamentally correct, most common, or original.  The seemingly different meanings originate from the core meaning of \"in essence.\"  A fun fact: a common synonym is 根本 (konpon), meaning \"root\" or \"origin,\" further highlighting 大体's focus on the essential nature of something, regardless of subsequent alterations.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of 大体 (daitai) is quite straightforward. It's a compound of 大 (oo) meaning \"big\" or \"great\" and 体 (karada) meaning \"body\" or \"form.\"  The original meaning might have been \"the main part\" or \"the essential form,\" which evolved to its current adverbial sense conveying the general state or amount.",

      "nuance": "The 「なぜ君はここにいるんだ？」 is a more forceful, masculine way of asking the question.  It's less polite than 「なぜここにいるのですか？」 but suitable between male friends. The use of \"だいたい\" softens the bluntness slightly, indicating that he is irritated by the fact that he has to ask in the first place."
