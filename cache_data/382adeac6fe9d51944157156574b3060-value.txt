    "writeup": "「甲斐」 is a noun that expresses whether something is worth the effort, or if something has meaning or value. It's used to evaluate if the outcome of an action justified the effort that went into it. You'll often see it in phrases like 「～甲斐がある」 (worth doing) or 「～甲斐がない」 (not worth doing).

There are several common patterns:\n\n*   **Verb (past, plain form) + 甲斐がある/ない**: Indicates whether the action was worth doing.\n*   **Noun + の + 甲斐がある/ない**: Indicates whether the noun has value or is worth the effort.\n*   **Verb (ます-stem) + 甲斐**: Indicates the worth or value in doing something.",
