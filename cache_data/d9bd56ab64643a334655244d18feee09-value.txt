  "writeup": "The particle ざる (zaru) is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb ず (zu).  It maintains the negative meaning 'not' inherent in ず, conjugating similarly to ない (nai).  Often translated as 'un-' as in 'unstoppable,'  ざる typically modifies verbs describing a following noun. While potentially replaceable by ない in some instances, modern Japanese usage largely confines ざる to established expressions or set phrases, notably the ざるを得ない (zaru o e nai)  structure, meaning 'to have no choice but to.'  **Important Consideration:**  Unlike many modern verbs, ざる conjugates with the せ (se) stem of する (suru) rather than the し (shi) stem.  A fascinating etymological note: some dictionaries list ざる as the attributive form of the classical ざり (zari), which is a contraction of ず (zu) and あり (ari, 'to be'). Thus, both etymologies are arguably correct, with ず representing the fundamental origin.",

    {
      "japanese": "彼はどんな辛い時でも弱音を**言わざる**人だ。",
      "english": "He's the kind of person who doesn't complain, no matter how tough things get.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "negative (plain)",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「言わざる」 (iwanazaru), a negative form appropriate for describing a consistent character trait in a somewhat formal yet relatable manner.  The lack of specific gendered language makes it suitable for either gender speaking about a male or female."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "記事のタイトル：「演歌歌手鈴木太朗の知られ**ざる**過去。」",
      "english": "Article title: \"The Unknown Past of Enka Singer Suzuki Taro.\"",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The use of 「ざる」 (zaru) in the title creates an air of mystery, fitting for a headline. The formal register is due to the nature of the article title."

      "nuance": "The phrase 「せざるを得ない」 (sezaru o enai) is used to convey necessity, a common usage in formal settings like official notices.  The politeness is enforced by the use of 「発生致しません」 (hassei itashimasen)."

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「忘れざる」 (wasurezaru) to create a sense of longing and deep affection, a nuance common in intimate speech. The use of  「奪う」(ubau) implies a strong attraction, which is common in this register for males expressing feelings to females. "

      "conjugation": "negative (plain) - potential",
      "nuance": "The speaker uses 「いられ（ない）」 (irarenai) which implies an involuntary action, making the confession more natural and less assertive.  The casual register, with 「好き」 (suki) is suitable for early romantic encounters between younger generations."

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "inspirational",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The use of 「絶えざる」 (eazaru) emphasizes the continuous nature of effort, and is a suitable word choice for an inspirational speech.  The sentence structure and vocabulary maintain formality."
    }
  ],
  "etymology": "The word ざる (zaru) originates from the classical negative auxiliary verb ず (zu), which indicates negation.  Its attributive form, ざる, retains this negating function but is primarily used in set phrases within modern Japanese. The connection to ざり (zari), a contraction of ず and あり, further illuminates its historical roots."
