    "etymology": "「考えられない」 is composed of 「考える」(kangaeru, to think) and 「られない」(rarenai), which is the negative potential form of a verb. Therefore, literally, it means 'cannot be thought'.",
    "writeup": "「考えられない」 expresses that something is unthinkable or unimaginable. It is the negative potential form of the verb 「考える」(kangaeru, to think). It often follows adverbs like 「など」 (nado, such as) or expressions that nominalize a phrase, such as 「ということは」(to iu koto wa, the fact that...). It implies a stronger sense of disbelief than simply \"not thinking\" about something. While 「考えない」 (kangaenai, to not consider) and 「考えていない」 (kangaeteinai, to not be considering) indicate a conscious choice, 「考えられない」 suggests an inherent impossibility to conceive of something.",
