    "etymology": "The grammar point 「得ない」 is derived from the verb 「得る (eru)」, which means \"to obtain, acquire, or gain.\" When 「得る」 is combined with 「ない」, it creates a negative connotation, indicating the lack of ability or possibility to obtain or achieve something.",
    "writeup": "「得ない (enai)」 is a formal expression indicating impossibility or inability. It's constructed by attaching 「得ない」 to a noun, the dictionary form of a verb, or an adjective. Compared to 「できない」, 「得ない」 conveys a stronger sense of impossibility, closer to \"there is no possibility that (A) can be done.\" While 「得る」 can be read as either 「える (eru)」 or 「うる (uru)」, only 「える」 is used in the negative form with 「ない」. Several set phrases using this grammar point are common in daily speech, such as 「あり得る (ari eru)」 meaning \"possible,\" and 「あり得ない (ari enai)」 meaning \"impossible.\"",
