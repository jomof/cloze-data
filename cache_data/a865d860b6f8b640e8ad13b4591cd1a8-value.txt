  "writeup": "つまり (tsumari), sometimes written as 詰まり (tsumari), is an adverbial particle in Japanese used to summarize or rephrase a preceding statement.  It's versatile and translates to phrases like \"in short,\" \"to sum up,\" or \"in other words.\"  It efficiently condenses information, making it ideal for concise communication.  The word's etymology is quite interesting. It originates from the verb 詰まる (tsumaru), meaning \"to become packed\" or \"to become congested.\"  This original meaning subtly reflects the function of つまり as a linguistic tool that compresses and clarifies meaning. This is a standard word, suitable for most situations.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "ハマサキさんはまた何も言わずに休んだのですか？つまり、また無断欠勤という事ですね。",
      "english": "Hamasaki-san didn't come to work again without saying anything? In other words, he ditched work again, didn't he?",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a semi-formal register appropriate for discussing workplace issues.  The use of \"無断欠勤\" (mudan kekkin, unauthorized absence) adds formality. The question 「ハマサキさんはまた何も言わずに休んだのですか？」 sets the stage for the concise summary provided by つまり. "

    {
      "japanese": "彼氏と本当に別れたの？つまり、もうあんな奴と関わらなくていいということ？",
      "english": "Did you really break up with your boyfriend? In other words, that means you don't have to deal with that jerk anymore?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The casual register is evident in the use of  「彼氏」 (kareshi, boyfriend) and the somewhat informal 「あんな奴」 (anna yatsu, that kind of guy). The question 「彼氏と本当に別れたの？」 is very informal, fitting for a close friendship setting. The listener's relief is conveyed effectively with つまり."

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "condescending",
      "nuance": "The casual register and the use of 「ダラダラしていた」 (daradara shite ita, lazed around) add a slightly condescending tone.  The summary using つまり emphasizes the speaker's disapproval of the listener's behavior."

      "japanese": "明日何時でも良いんだって。つまり、夜遅くなっても良いらしい。",
      "english": "They say anytime tomorrow is fine.  So, it seems even late at night is okay.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "This uses a casual register, showing a relaxed conversation.  The use of 「らしい」(rashii, seems like) softens the certainty of the statement."

      "setting": "serious",
      "nuance": "The use of 「長々と説明したけど」(nag nag to setsumei shita kedo, I've explained at length) and 「ということだ」(to iu kotoda, means that) indicate a slightly more formal register, suitable for a serious situation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ねえ、私のこと好き？つまり…一緒にいたいって意味？",
      "english": "Hey, do you like me? In other words... does that mean you want to be with me?",
