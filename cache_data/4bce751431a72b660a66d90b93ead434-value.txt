    "writeup": "The phrase 「それなりに」 or 「それなりの」 indicates that something is done or exists in its own way, or in a manner suitable to the situation. It acknowledges that something meets a certain standard or possesses qualities appropriate to its context, even if not exceptional. 「それなりに」 functions as an adverb, modifying verbs or adjectives, while 「それなりの」 acts as an adjectival phrase, modifying nouns. It can also express a sense of 'as expected' or 'to a certain degree'.",
    "etymology": "「それなり」 comes from 「それ」 (that) and 「なり」 (form/state). The 「に」 particle turns it into an adverb, and the 「の」 particle turns it into an adjectival phrase.",
