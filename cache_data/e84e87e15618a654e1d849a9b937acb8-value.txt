  "writeup": "The grammar construction  \"Verb + にいく\" indicates going somewhere *for the purpose* of doing something.  The verb preceding にいく expresses that purpose, and appears in its stem form.  This structure emphasizes the goal of the journey.  Think of it as \"to go in order to…\". For past tense, simply conjugate the verb before に行く appropriately.  This is a fundamental grammar point frequently used in everyday conversations.",
  "etymology": "行く (iku) meaning 'to go' is a fundamental verb.  The particle に marks purpose or direction, common in many Japanese grammatical constructions.  The combination naturally signifies the intention behind the act of going.",
