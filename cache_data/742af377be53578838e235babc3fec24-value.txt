    "writeup": "The prefix 「お」 is used to add politeness and respect to nouns, verbs, and adjectives. It is a fundamental component of polite Japanese and is crucial for showing deference and consideration in social interactions. While it can be added to various parts of speech, its usage isn't arbitrary; it's often determined by convention and the specific word.\n\n*   For verbs, 「お」 is commonly used in combination with 「～ます」 form to create honorific expressions like 「お読みになります」 (o-yomi ni narimasu, to read honorifically) or humble expressions like 「お持ちします」 (o-mochi shimasu, I will hold). Note that in polite speech you should use the お form with the verb stem.\n*   For adjectives, it's primarily used with い-adjectives and な-adjectives. Examples include 「お忙しい」 (o-isogashii, busy - polite) and 「お元気」 (o-genki, healthy/well-being - polite).\n*   For nouns, adding 「お」 can soften the tone or show respect, such as 「お名前」 (o-namae, name - polite) or 「お茶」 (o-cha, tea - polite). However, not all nouns can take 「お」, and the choice often depends on established usage.\n\nEtiquette dictates that using 「お」 appropriately is essential for maintaining harmonious relationships and conveying the right level of respect in various social contexts. You must exercise discretion and sensitivity when deciding whether to use 「お」 to ensure that your language reflects appropriate levels of formality and respect.",
    "etymology": "The prefix 「お」 has its roots in classical Japanese, where it was used to denote respect and reverence. Over time, it evolved into a standard element of polite language, reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society and the importance of showing deference to superiors or elders. The usage of 「お」 is deeply intertwined with the development of keigo (敬語), or honorific language, in Japan.",
