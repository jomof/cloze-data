  "writeup": "どの (Dono) is a pre-noun adjectival, a special type of word in Japanese that doesn't conjugate.  It always appears in the same form.  This word, belonging to the same family as どれ (Dore) and どこ (Doko), is used to ask about which item from three or more options someone would choose.  It can function similarly to \"which\" or even \"whatever/whichever\" in English, depending on the context.  \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n* どの is used only when there are three or more choices.  For only two choices, use どっち (Dotchi) or どちら (Dochira). \n* The nuance shifts subtly depending on context, which we'll explore in the examples.",
  "etymology": "どの likely originates from the demonstrative pronoun \"ど\" (Do), meaning 'that,' combined with a suffix indicating a choice or selection. This makes it conceptually similar to English words like 'which' or 'what kind of'. The evolution of its usage specifically for three or more choices is fascinating, showing how language adapts to fine-tune meaning.",

      "japanese": "赤か青、どっちがいい？",
      "english": "Red or blue, which is better?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "casual",
      "nuance": "This uses \"どっち\" (Dotchi) instead of \"どの\" because there are only two options. The casual register is reflected in the use of the plain form of the verb \"いい\" (ii, good)."

      "japanese": "どの色が好き？",
      "english": "What color do you like?",
      "register": "casual",

      "nuance": "This is a simple, friendly question using \"どの\" (Dono) appropriately to select from many options. The sentence structure is basic and casual."

      "japanese": "どの寿司屋がいいですか。",
      "english": "Which sushi restaurant is good?",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The polite ending \"ですか\" (desuka) elevates the register.  \"どの\" (Dono) is correctly used to inquire about a selection from multiple sushi restaurants."

      "japanese": "どのレストランに行く？",
      "english": "Which restaurant are we going to?",

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The casual register and implied shared activity creates a relaxed, intimate atmosphere suitable for a first date.  A female speaker might use 「どれにしようかな」 (Dore ni shiyou kana) instead, adding a softer, more contemplative tone."

    {
      "japanese": "どのブランドのバッグが欲しいですか？",
      "english": "Which brand of bag do you want?",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "negotiating",
      "nuance": "The polite form \"ですか\" (desuka) maintains a respectful and professional tone, suitable for a sales situation. The use of 「どの」 (Dono) indicates a variety of options are available."

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": "polite",
      "nuance": "The use of sonkeigo (respectful language), 「あなた好みの」(anata-go no) and 「選んであげましょうか」(erande agemashou ka) elevates this to a respectful and somewhat flirty tone.  A female might instead say something like 「どれがいいかしら？」(Dore ga ii kashira?), making it softer and less assertive."
