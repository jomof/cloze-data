  "writeup": "The suffix ぎみ (gimi), derived from the noun 気味 (kimo, meaning 'sensation' or 'feeling'), is used to express a slight or subtle indication of a state or condition.  It's often translated as 'looking (A)', 'a touch of (A)', 'feeling a little (A)', or 'slightly (A)'.  It can be attached to nouns or the conjunctive form of verbs.  ぎみ expresses the subjective feeling of the speaker, making it suitable for describing one's own feelings or observations about others.  Its use frequently softens a statement, avoiding an overly assertive tone.  **Important:** Despite its origin in 気味 (kimo), ぎみ is always pronounced with a 'gi' sound, not 'ki'. This subtle phonetic shift helps differentiate it from the noun.",
  "etymology": "ぎみ originates from the noun 気味 (kimo), meaning 'feeling' or 'condition'. Over time, it evolved into a suffix, undergoing a sound change from 'ki' to 'gi' to distinguish it grammatically from the noun. This exemplifies the dynamic nature of Japanese word formation, where meanings subtly shift and pronunciation adapts to grammatical function.",

    {
      "false_friend": "ような気がする",
