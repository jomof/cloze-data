    "etymology": "の is originally a possessive particle, but here it's being used to nominalize the preceding clause. は marks the topic of the sentence, indicating what is being discussed or focused on.",
    "writeup": "「のは」 nominalizes a verb, adjective, or noun phrase, allowing it to function as a noun within a sentence. Think of it as turning a clause into a 'thing' you can talk about. It's similar to using 'that' or 'what' in English. For example, instead of saying just \"I eat sushi,\" you can say \"What I eat is sushi\" using 「寿司を食べる**のは**、私です。」. 「のは」 can be used with verbs and adjectives in their plain forms (dictionary form, past form, etc.) and nouns/na-adjectives followed by 「な」.",
