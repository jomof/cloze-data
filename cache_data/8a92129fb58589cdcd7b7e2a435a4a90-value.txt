    "etymology": "The word 「ふう」 comes from the kanji 「風」 (kaze), meaning \"wind\" or \"air.\" While it doesn't directly translate, think of it as something having an \"air\" or \"style\" of something else. The 「に」 particle turns it into an adverb.",
    "writeup": "「ふうに」 (fuu ni) indicates that something is done in a particular style, manner, or method. Think of it as doing something \"in the way of\" something else, or \"like\" something else. It often follows verbs or pre-noun adjectival words (like 「こんな」, 「そんな」, 「あんな」).  \n\nFor instance, 「こんなふうに」 means \"like this,\" 「そんなふうに」 means \"like that,\" and 「あんなふうに」 means \"like that over there.\" \n\nWhile 「風」 means \"wind,\" a helpful mnemonic is to think of 「ふうに」 as \"having an air of,\" although the overlap isn't 100% equivalent.",
