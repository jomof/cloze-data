    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にかけて」 comes from the verb 「掛ける (kakeru)」, which means \"to hang,\" \"to suspend,\" or \"to extend.\" The 「に」 indicates a direction or starting point, so literally, it suggests something extends 'towards' or 'over' a certain period or area.",
    "writeup": "「にかけて」 indicates that something occurs over a period of time or spans a range. It is often used to express duration or extent, such as \"from X to Y\" or \"throughout Z.\" It's formed by combining the particle 「に」 with the て-form of the verb 「掛ける」. Although it appears quite often in news, it is primarily used in written language, indicating that some weather pattern is expected to continue for a set period of time.\n\n*   「AからBにかけて」: From A to B (time or location)\n*   「期間にかけて」: Over a period\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   When the particle 「は」 is used after 「にかけて」 (にかけては), the meaning shifts to "when it comes to" or "regarding."",
