  "etymology": "ゆえに is a compound word.  ゆえ (yue) means \"reason,\" \"cause,\" or \"consequence.\"  The particle に (ni) marks the reason or cause.  Therefore, ゆえに literally means \"because of the reason.\"  The formal register reflects its origins in classical Japanese.",
  "writeup": "The expression ゆえに (yueni) is a formal way of stating a reason or cause.  It's often used in written Japanese, academic contexts, or formal speeches.  Think of it as a more sophisticated and emphatic version of because or therefore.  It carries a sense of logical consequence, emphasizing the direct relationship between cause and effect.  While often translated as \"because,\" \"due to,\" or \"therefore,\"  \"as a consequence of\" or \"consequently\" sometimes provides a more accurate nuance, particularly when the consequence is significant or unexpected.  The use of ゆえに often implies a weighty or serious reason, contrasting with simpler causal expressions.  When ゆえに begins a sentence, it indicates that the reason being given directly relates to the preceding statement, showing a clear and logical progression of thought.  Importantly, ゆえ (yue) is a noun meaning 'cause' or 'reason', so when you want to modify another noun with this concept, you use ゆえの (yueno) instead. For instance,  若さゆえの過ち (wakasa yueno ayamachi) means \"mistake due to youth.\" This is a crucial distinction. Remember to avoid using ゆえに in casual conversation; it would sound unnatural.",
