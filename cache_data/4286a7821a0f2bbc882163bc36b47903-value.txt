    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にする」 is a combination of the particle 「に」, which indicates a target or purpose, and the verb 「する」, meaning \"to do\" or \"to make.\" Etymologically, it signifies the act of 'making' something 'into' a specific state or choice.",
    "writeup": "「にする」 combines the particle 「に」 (target/purpose) with the verb 「する」 (to do/make). It expresses the idea of \"deciding on,\" \"choosing,\" or \"making something into\" a particular state or thing. The speaker typically has direct control over the outcome, conveying a strong sense of choice.\n\nThe noun preceding 「にする」 is what's being decided or made. While often translated as \"to decide,\" it can also be closer to the English slang \"to do (A),\" as in 「ビールにする」 (\"I'll do a beer\").\n\nUsing 「とする」 instead of 「にする」 softens the nuance, making it less direct. 「とする」 is more common in formal settings as it sounds less assertive. Think of 「にする」 as \"I'll buy a burger\" (direct) versus 「とする」 as \"I'll go with a burger\" (less pushy).\n\n「にする」 can apply to abstract nouns, not just physical items.",
