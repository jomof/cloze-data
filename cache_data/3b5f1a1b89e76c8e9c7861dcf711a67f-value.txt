  "writeup": "のももっともだ is a nuanced expression combining の, も, the な-adjective もっとも ('reasonable', 'plausible'), and the auxiliary verb だ.  It conveys understanding of the underlying logic behind a situation, regardless of agreement.  Think of it as expressing, \"It may well be (A)\" or \"It's only natural that (A)\", emphasizing the reasonability rather than necessarily endorsing the outcome.  It's used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns (dropping の for nouns).  Explanatory particles like から or ので often accompany it, providing context for the reasonability.  Mastering this requires understanding its subtle emphasis on the logic, not just the agreement with a statement.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's core, もっとも, stems from もっと (more) and も (also/even), highlighting the reason's strength.  The addition of の emphasizes the focus on the reason itself and its inherent plausibility within the context. だ adds a conclusive assertion of the reasonable nature of the situation.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "彼が忙しいのはもっともだ。毎日長時間働いているのだから。",
      "english": "It's only natural that he's busy. He works long hours every day.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「忙しいのはもっともだ」, a standard and neutral phrase, suitable for various contexts.  It provides an explanation, \"He works long hours every day,\" clearly showing the logical connection. The sentence is natural and understandable by most speakers of Japanese, regardless of gender or age."

    {
      "japanese": "彼女が怒るのももっともだ。そんな失礼なことを言ったのだから。",
      "english": "It's no wonder she's angry. You said such a rude thing.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register, 「そんな失礼なことを言ったのだから」, suits the explanation of the anger.  The phrase is generally acceptable across genders and ages in a casual setting, but overly familiar phrasing might be seen as inappropriate depending on the context."

      "japanese": "試験で失敗したのももっともだ。全然勉強しなかったのだから。",
      "english": "It's only natural that you failed the test. You didn't study at all.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "sympathetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This casual, 「全然勉強しなかったのだから」, would be suitable between friends, or between people who have established close relationships.  The age and gender difference might not matter much in such a casual setting.",

      "listener_age": "younger"
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼が彼女と別れたのももっともだ。彼女は彼を何度も裏切ったのだから。",
      "english": "It's no wonder he broke up with her. She betrayed him repeatedly.",
      "register": "semi-formal",

    {
      "japanese": "彼が君のことが好きなのももっともだ。君は本当に魅力的な女性だから。",
      "english": "It's no wonder he likes you. You're a truly charming woman.",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The polite register, 「君は本当に魅力的な女性だから」, is used to compliment the listener while maintaining a respectful distance.  The male speaker using 「君」can be both flirtatious and friendly, but is dependent on other factors in the sentence to fully understand the context.  The indirectness makes it suitable for early stages of courtship."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼が君のことが好きなのももっともだ。君の笑顔は、まるで春の日のように温かいから。",
      "english": "It's only natural that he likes you; your smile is as warm as a spring day.",

      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The female speaker using a polite register, 「君の笑顔は、まるで春の日のように温かいから」, shows that she is considerate and thoughtful. The simile 「まるで春の日のように温かい」 is poetic and adds a gentle touch to the compliment, showing refinement and care in her words."

      "meaning": "It is only natural that, It is no wonder",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While similar, 「のも当然だ」 implies a more straightforward, almost expected outcome, lacking the nuanced understanding of the underlying reason that 「のももっともだ」 conveys."

      "term": "て当然だ",
      "meaning": "Natural, As a matter of course",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that もっともだ focuses on the logical plausibility of an event, given the circumstances.  当然だ emphasizes expectation, while て当然だ is a more concise, informal way of expressing something being only natural. Choose the phrase that best reflects the level of understanding and the degree of expectation you want to convey."
