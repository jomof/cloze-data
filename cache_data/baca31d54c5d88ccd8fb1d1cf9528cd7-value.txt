    },
    "writeup": "「ようものなら」 is used to express what would happen if something undesirable were to occur. It carries a strong nuance of warning or negative consequence. It's similar to saying \"if you even *think* of doing that...\" The grammar point indicates the speaker thinks the action is unlikely or undesirable, and the consequences would be severe. It is often found in formal writing and speech. This pattern is formed by attaching 「ようものなら」 to the volitional form of a verb. The verb attached to 「ようものなら」 must be one that the speaker wants the listener to avoid doing.",
    "etymology": "「よう」 is derived from the volitional form of verbs, indicating intention or volition. 「ものなら」 adds the hypothetical condition and the sense of something being highly unlikely or undesirable. The combination emphasizes the negative consequences of the hypothetical action.",
