    "etymology": "「より」 (yori) means \"than\" or \"from,\" indicating a comparison. 「のほうが」 (no hou ga) means \"the direction of\" or \"the side of,\" implying a preference or a higher degree of something. Together, they create a structure for comparing two things and stating which is \"more\" of a certain quality.",
    "writeup": "「より〜のほうが」is used to express that one thing is \"more (A)\" than another. 「より」 translates roughly to \"than\" or \"rather than.\" The part after 「のほうが」 must be an adjective. This grammar point is similar to 「たほうがいい」 and 「ないほうがいい」, but can be used to compare **any** pair of adjectives, verbs, or nouns, so long as 「のほうが」 is followed by an adjective.\n\n*   From the examples below, you'll see that 「より」 always appears after the word that has the lower extent of (A), when used together with 「のほうが」.\n\n*   While 「の方が」 is the most common construction, the particle 「を」 may sometimes replace 「が」, especially when used with markers of desire such as 「たい」 and 「ほしい」. 「が」 emphasizes what a person wants (the whole statement), while 「を」 emphasizes the item or action itself (regardless of the rest of the statement). With 「たい」, both 「を」 and 「が」 sound natural. However, with 「ほしい」, 「が」 is more natural, while 「を」 is accepted. This use of 「ほしい」 only applies to wanting items, as opposed to 「たい」, which indicates the desire to 'do' something.",
