    "etymology": "もっとも is derived from the noun 尤も (mottomo), meaning 'reasonableness' or 'justice.' As a conjunction, it retains the nuance of acknowledging the validity of a statement while introducing a contrasting or qualifying point. It implies that while something is true, it is not the only relevant consideration.",
    "writeup": "もっとも is a conjunction used to introduce a clarification or qualification to a preceding statement. It conveys that while the initial statement (A) holds true, there's another aspect or consideration (B) that needs to be taken into account. Common translations include \"although,\" \"however,\" \"but,\" \"for all that,\" or \"with that said,\" depending on the context. The part following もっとも often ends with が, けど, or けれども, emphasizing the contrast or qualification. The speaker acknowledges the truth or validity of the first part (A), but suggests it is not the complete picture.",
    "examples": [
        {
            "japanese": "私の妹はピアノを弾くのがじょうずだ。**もっとも**、弾けるのは一曲だけだ。",
            "english": "My sister is good at playing the piano. Although, she can only play one song.",
            "register": "semi-formal",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "The sentence uses the standard 「だ」 form, indicating a semi-formal tone. The 「もっとも」 adds a qualification to the initial statement. 「弾けるのは一曲だけだ」 clarifies the extent of her piano skill.",
            "etymology": "「弾くのがじょうずだ」 uses the verb 「弾く」 (hiku, to play a stringed instrument) and 「じょうずだ」 (jouzu da, to be good at)."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "俺はすき焼きが大好きだ。**もっとも**、毎日食べれる訳では無い。",
            "english": "I love sukiyaki. Although, it does not mean that I can eat it every day.",
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "friendly",
            "speaker_gender": "male",
            "nuance": "「俺」 is a masculine first-person pronoun, indicating a male speaker. The 「だ」 at the end of 「大好きだ」 is dropped to 「大好き」, adding to the casual feel. The 「もっとも」 introduces a limitation to his love for sukiyaki. 「食べれる訳では無い」 is a colloquial expression.",
            "etymology": "「すき焼き」 (sukiyaki) is a popular Japanese dish. The use of 「訳ではない」 (wake dewa nai) indicates that something is not necessarily the case."

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "The sentence uses 「けど」 at the end, which is a casual way to end a sentence, softening the tone. The 「もっとも」 introduces a contrast, highlighting that knowledge doesn't always require direct experience.",
            "etymology": "「ものすごく」 (monosugoku) means extremely or very much. 「詳しいです」 (kuwashii desu) means to be knowledgeable or detailed."

            "etymology": "「持ってきた」 (motte kita) is the past tense of 「持ってくる」 (motte kuru, to bring). 「いらない」 (iranai) means not needed or unnecessary."

            "nuance": "「〜よう」 form is used with 「信用できる」, indicating speculation. The inclusion of 「けど」 softens the statement and adds a touch of informality. 「もっとも」 is used to balance the initial statement.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「それなのに」, 「のなかで〜がいちばん〜」, and 「しかしながら」 can sometimes be used in similar contexts, it's important to understand their distinct nuances. 「それなのに」 highlights an unexpected result given a prior condition, 「のなかで〜がいちばん〜」 expresses the superlative, and 「しかしながら」 provides a stronger, more formal contrast. Use 「もっとも」 when you want to acknowledge a statement but then introduce a qualifying point that needs to be considered alongside it."
