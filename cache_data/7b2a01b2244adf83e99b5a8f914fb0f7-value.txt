  "writeup": "The Japanese construction なくて (nakute) combines the negative ない (nai) in its て-form (nakute) with the te-form conjunction particle て.  This creates a negative conjunction, similar to 'and not' in English. However,  なくて often functions more subtly. It's frequently used to highlight a reason or cause, resulting in translations like 'because not...' or 'since I didn't...'  Crucially, when used this way, なくて often precedes expressions describing the speaker's feelings or situations beyond their control—hence the 'because' nuance. Words like 困る (komaru, to be troubled), 嬉しい (ureshii, to be happy), 疲れている (tsukareteiru, to be tired), 心配 (shinpai, to worry), and 安心 (anshin, to be relieved) frequently follow なくて in this context.  Understanding this 'beyond control' element is key to mastering this nuanced grammar point.",
  "etymology": "なくて (nakute) is formed by combining the negative form of the verb ない (nai, 'to not be') with the te-form connective て (te).  The て form is versatile, indicating sequence, reason, condition, or means. Adding the negative ない modifies this connective function to express a negative cause or reason.",
