  "writeup": "The grammar point ことにする (koto ni suru) means \"to decide to,\" or \"to make a decision to.\"  It's formed by combining こと (koto, \"thing\"), a nominalizer creating a noun phrase, and する (suru, \"to do\").  The structure literally translates to \"to make it a thing to (verb).\"  This construction conveys a sense of resolve and finality in the decision-making process.  It can be used with both affirmative and negative verb phrases. The verb preceding こと must be in its attributive (dictionary or i-adjective) form.  This contrasts with する alone, which is less emphatic. Note that the する component can also take the negative ない form to express deciding *against* something.",
  "etymology": "こと (koto) originates from the ancient verb form of ことする (koto suru), meaning \"to do something.\"  The nominalizer function of こと evolved over time, allowing it to function as a versatile element in forming nuanced grammatical structures like ことにする.",
