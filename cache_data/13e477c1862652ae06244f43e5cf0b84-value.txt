    "writeup": "「Noun/な-Adjective + は + 〜となっている」 is a formal expression indicating that something has become a certain way, has been established as something, or simply happens to be in a particular state. It emphasizes the current, established condition of the subject. The literal sense is close to \"it is now the case that (A) is (B)\". This structure often appears in formal contexts such as news reports, official announcements, and academic writing.\n\nThe 「は」 highlights the topic, while 「となっている」 indicates that the subject is in a certain state **as a result** of a process or decision. Unlike 「になっている」, 「となっている」 strongly implies a sense of finality or established status.",
