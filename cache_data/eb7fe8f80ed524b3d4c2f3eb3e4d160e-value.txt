    "Usage": "Used to indicate that the speaker expects the listener to understand which specific item or person is being referred to. It implies a shared understanding or prior conversation about the subject.",

    "Register": "Can be used in various registers, from casual to semi-formal, depending on the context and relationship between speakers."
  },
  "etymology": "「例 (rei)」 means \"example\" or \"custom.\" The addition of 「の (no)」 here works similarly to English \"the,\" pointing to something already known or understood.",
  "writeup": "「例の (rei no)」 is used to refer to something that both the speaker and listener are assumed to be familiar with. Think of it as the Japanese equivalent of saying \"that certain...\" or \"the usual...\" It implies a shared understanding or prior discussion about the subject at hand, so it's more than just 'the'. If you say 「例の場所」, it's not just 'the place,' but a place that you and your listener both know about.",
