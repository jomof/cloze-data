  "writeup": "The particle に and the expression 合わせる (awaseru) or 合った (atta) create nuanced ways to express matching, fitting, or adjusting to something.  When using the て-form 合わせて (awasete), it indicates an action performed to match or fit something else.  The nuance is one of deliberate adjustment or synchronization.  Think of it as 'in line with' or 'to match'.  The past tense form 合った (atta) of the verb 合う (au), meaning 'to match' or 'to fit', is used to describe a state of compatibility or appropriateness.  It emphasizes a pre-existing harmony or suitability.  Both forms are versatile and used widely, but the choice depends on whether you are highlighting the action of matching or the state of being matched.",
  "etymology": "合わせる (awaseru) comes from the verb 合う (au) meaning \"to meet,\" \"to fit,\" or \"to match.\"  The causative form 合わせる adds the meaning of causing something to meet or fit. に合った (ni atta) is the past tense form of the verb 合う (au) combined with the particle に, indicating something is appropriate or suited for something else.",
