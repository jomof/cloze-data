    "etymology": "「ところ」 (tokoro) means \"place\" or \"point.\" 「が」 (ga) is a conjunction particle. Together, they create a conjunction that highlights a contrast or unexpected result.",
    "writeup": "「ところが」 is a conjunction used to express that something unexpected happened, contrary to what was expected. It's similar to \"however\" or \"but\" in English. It connects two sentences, where the second sentence presents a result that contrasts with the first sentence's expectation. 「ところが」 is often used at the beginning of the second sentence. It emphasizes the unexpected nature of the outcome. Because 「ところが」 highlights a result that is unexpected, it can only be used for things that are beyond the control of the speaker. However, if the speaker is trying to do something, but assumes that their attempt may result in failure, 「ところが」 can be used to show that they were unexpectedly successful. This use of 「が」 in Japanese is referred to as 確定の逆接, which basically means \"a contradictory conclusion\".",
