  "writeup": "The adverbial particle ばかり, when attached to the past tense of a verb (using た), indicates that an action has just finished, recently stopped, or been completed.  It emphasizes the recency of the action.  Think of it as conveying a sense of immediacy.  While ばかり has other uses (indicating degree or limit), this lesson focuses solely on its 'just completed' meaning.  This is a very common and useful particle in everyday Japanese conversation.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of ばかり is complex and debated. Some scholars link it to the verb ばかりに (bakari ni), meaning 'only,' 'just,' or 'merely,' suggesting a semantic shift from a limiting quantity to a recently completed action. Others propose a connection to the word ばかり (bakari), indicating an approximate amount, which could plausibly have developed into a temporal sense.",

      "kind": "synonym",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the nuance of time and the grammatical category of the word you're using. たばかり focuses on the immediate past of an action (verb), while たところだ emphasizes the end of a longer process. たとたんに marks the precise moment of transition, and たて describes freshness related to a noun.  Careful selection of the appropriate particle based on the context is key."
