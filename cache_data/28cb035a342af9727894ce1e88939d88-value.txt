  "writeup": "The conjunction particle て, in this context, functions similarly to 'since,' 'due to,' or 'because of' in English.  Crucially, phrases using this nuance of the て-form generally express something beyond the speaker's control in the (B) statement.  This grammatical structure pairs the て-form of a verb (or い-adjective) with a (B) phrase. For nouns and な-adjectives, use で instead of て.  The 'because' implication stems from the uncontrollability of the (B) phrase, rather than an inherent meaning shift in て or で.  Think of it this way: (A) て 困る – 'Being troubled' is uncontrollable; (A) must have caused it.  This pattern extends to many expressions conveying uncontrollable feelings or states:  嬉しい (happy), 大変 (difficult), びっくり (surprised), 疲れている (tired), 心配 (worried).",
