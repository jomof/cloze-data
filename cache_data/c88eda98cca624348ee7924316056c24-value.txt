    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the combination of 「て」form (indicating a conditional or conjunctive relationship) + 「も」 (even if) + 「差し支える」 (to interfere, to hinder) in its negative form 「差し支えない」 (does not interfere, no problem).",
    "writeup": "「ても差し支えない」 is a polite expression similar to 「てもいい」 (may I) or \"do you mind.\" It combines 「ても」 (or 「でも」 after nouns and な-adjectives) with the negative form of the verb 「差し支える」 (to interfere, to hinder), resulting in 「差し支えない」. It's used to ask for or grant permission. Given its politeness, 「ありません」 is generally favored over just 「ない」. The literal meaning is \"it is not a hindrance if (A).\" When seeking permission, 「か」 is often added to the end. It is best to avoid 「ても差し支えないです」 since it is considered less polite than other similar expressions.\n\nWhile 「ても差し支えない」 is used in polite sentences, the verb 「差し支える」 itself is not exclusively polite and can appear when indicating (A) has or will negatively impact (B).",
