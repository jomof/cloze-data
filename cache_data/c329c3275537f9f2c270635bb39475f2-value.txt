    "writeup": "ところで is a conjunction particle made up of the noun ところ, meaning \"place,\" and the case-marking particle で. It's used similarly to \"by the way\" or \"incidentally\" in English, but specifically to introduce **new, unrelated topics**.  ところで typically appears at the beginning of a sentence to signal a shift to a different subject.  The literal sense of ところで is closer to \"and with that,\" implying that something in the previous conversation reminded the speaker of something else, which becomes the new topic of discussion.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\nBe careful not to confuse ところで with たところで, which has a completely different meaning and is used to express that something is not the case despite a certain condition.",
