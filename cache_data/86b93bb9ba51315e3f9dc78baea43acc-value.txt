    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from a combination of the question particle 「か」, the quotative particle 「と」, the verb 「言う」 (to say), and the resultative particle 「と」. It literally translates to something akin to 'If (A) were to be asked, (B) is the result.'",
    "writeup": "～かというと is a phrase with two primary functions. The first is used in conjunction with 'why' and 'how' words, like どうして or なぜ, while the other is used with 'who', 'when', 'where', and 'what'. This lesson focuses on the former. かというと is a combination of the question marking particle 「か」, the quotative particle 「と」, the verb 「言う」 ('to say'), and the resultative particle 「と」. This is quite a few particles combined together, but the literal meaning is more simply 'if (A) were to be asked,' before the speaker goes on to highlight their reasoning in (B).\n\nAs ～かというと precedes an explanation, から is often used at the end of the sentence as 'because,' emphasizing the speaker's reasoning.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nLike other grammar points that utilize the 'if' nuance of 「と」, 「ば」, and sometimes even 「たら」 may be used. However, 「たら」 appears less frequently than 「と」 or 「ば」.",
