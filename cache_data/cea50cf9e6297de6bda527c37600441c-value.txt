  "writeup": "The word それで is a conjunction frequently used to connect two sentences or clauses.  It's literally a combination of the pronoun それ \"that\" and the particle で, indicating means or reason.  Therefore, それで translates to  \"because of that,\" \"so?,\" \"and then?,\" \"therefore,\" or \"with that.\"  The \"that\" refers to the preceding sentence or clause.  It's often used at the beginning of a sentence to emphasize the connection to the previous information.  Note that you'll also see それでは, where は is the topic marker and で is the conjunctive form of だ (the copula). This shifts the meaning slightly closer to \"well then,\" \"in that case,\" or \"if so.\"  This form is frequently shortened to じゃ.",
  "etymology": "それで is a combination of the demonstrative pronoun それ (sore - that) and the particle で (de). The particle で indicates reason, means, or manner.  The combination thus indicates a causal or consequential relationship between two clauses or sentences.",
