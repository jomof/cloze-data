    "writeup": "「ないほうがいい」 is the negative counterpart to 「たほうがいい」 and is used to give advice, suggesting that it is better *not* to do something. The structure is straightforward: verb in the **negative plain form** + 「方」 + 「が」 + い-adjective 「いい」.  「方 (ほう)」 literally means \"direction\" or \"way,\" so this grammar point implies that not doing the verb is the better \"way\" or choice. It carries a nuance of potential negative consequences if the action is taken. It's a direct way of giving advice, but generally considered softer than stronger prohibitive grammar like 「〜てはいけない」.",
    "etymology": "The phrase combines the negative form of a verb (indicating abstention), the noun 「方 (ほう)」 meaning 'way' or 'direction', the particle 「が」 marking the subject, and the adjective 「いい」 meaning 'good'.  Therefore, etymologically, it suggests that the 'way' of 'not doing' something is 'good'.",
