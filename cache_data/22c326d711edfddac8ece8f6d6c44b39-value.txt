  "writeup": "The particles だった (casual) and でした (polite) indicate that something \"was\" a certain way in the past.  They are attached to nouns or な-adjectives.  This grammatical structure combines the copula だ (or its polite form です) with the past tense marker た.  For だった,  た is added to the base form だ.  For でした, the す in です changes to し before adding た.  Crucially, い-adjectives don't use だった/でした; they have their own past tense conjugations.  Mastering this distinction is essential for accurate past tense expression.",
  "etymology": "だった and でした are formed by combining the copula だ/です with the past tense marker た.  The change from す to し in the polite form reflects a common sound change in Japanese verb conjugation.",

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that while だった and でした are versatile, their use is restricted to nouns and な-adjectives.  Incorrect usage with い-adjectives is a common mistake among learners. Pay close attention to the nuances of formality; でした always conveys politeness.",
  "false_friends": [

      "term": "う-Verb (Past)",
      "nuance": "Unlike だった/でした which modify nouns and な-adjectives, past tense う-verbs conjugate differently, changing their stem vowel."
