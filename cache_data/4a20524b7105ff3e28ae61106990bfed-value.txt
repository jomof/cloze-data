    "etymology": "The word 「更に」 comes from the verb 「更ける (fukeru)」, which means \"to grow late\" or \"to advance.\" The kanji 「更」 itself carries the meaning of \"change\" or \"becoming late,\" implying a progression or advancement from one state to another. Therefore, 「更に」 extends this idea to mean \"even more\" or \"further.\"",
    "writeup": "「更に」 is an adverb that conveys the meaning of \"more and more,\" \"even more than (A),\" or \"again.\" It signifies an extension beyond an initial state, whether in terms of time, quantity, or volume. The expression used after 「更に」 will always be something that is further along than the initial statement. 「更に」 often appears at the beginning of the second part of a sentence, following the 'base' information. The meaning of 「更」 as \"approaching change\" indicates that something has already reached 'fullness,' and anything more will cause a fundamental change. Thus, 「更に」 primarily indicates things where (A) is considered 'complete' or 'enough' in itself, and (B) pushes that thing beyond a certain threshold, which may be positive or negative.",
