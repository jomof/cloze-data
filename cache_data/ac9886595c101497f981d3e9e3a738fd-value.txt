    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the volitional form of a verb (意向形, *ikoukei*) with the verb 思う (*omou*, to think). The volitional form expresses intention or volition, and adding 思う indicates that this intention is a thought or decision that the speaker has made.",
    "writeup": "The structure **Verb[volitional-form] + と思う** expresses the speaker's intention or decision to do something. It's similar to saying \"I think I will...\" or \"I'm going to...\" in English.  It indicates a plan or intention that has been formed in the speaker's mind. It's a very common and versatile expression in Japanese, suitable for everyday conversations.  It is often used with **思っている (omotteiru)** to express an ongoing intention.",
