    "writeup": "Similar to として, にして highlights an aspect of something from which another thing is observed. The key difference lies in the nuance: と implies that (B) results from (A), while に suggests that (B) exists or happens concurrently with (A). This reflects the locative function of the case marking particle に. The adverbial particle は marks the entire (A) phrase for comparison. にしては is generally translated as \"considering (A), (B)\" or \"even for (A), (B)\" and can be used with both nouns and verbs. While it originates from multiple parts, にしては is often treated as a single adverbial particle.\n\nDespite the common translation as \"considering (A), (B),\" にしては is closer in meaning to \"while (A), (B).\" This emphasizes the simultaneous relationship between (A) and (B), and it implies that (B) might not necessarily be a direct consequence of (A).",
