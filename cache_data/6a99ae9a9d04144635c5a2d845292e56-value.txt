    "etymology": "ましょう is derived from the polite auxiliary verb ます (masu), indicating politeness, combined with the volitional auxiliary verb う (u). Together, they form a polite volitional form, expressing intention or invitation.",
    "writeup": "ましょう is a polite way to suggest doing something together, translated as \"Let's...\" or \"Shall we...?\" It's the polite volitional form of a verb. To use it, attach it to the ます-stem of a verb. While often translated as \"Shall we...?\", ましょう doesn't specifically target another person; it can express the speaker's intention to do something. It expresses volition, reflecting a deliberate, purposeful action, similar to \"I shall\" in English, indicating a strong resolution.",
