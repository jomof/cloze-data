    "etymology": "なくて is derived from the negative auxiliary verb ない (nai) conjugated to its -te form (なく + て). The -te form in this case indicates a reason or cause.",
    "writeup": "なくて combines the negative form of a verb or adjective (ない) with the conjunction て.  It conveys a sense of \"not being... and as a result...\" or \"because it isn't...\". It's often used to explain the reason or cause behind a situation or feeling. The phrase following 「なくて」 frequently expresses the speaker's feelings (e.g., 困る, 嬉しい, 心配) or describes a situation beyond their direct control.  Because of the cause and effect, the translation often becomes 'because'.",
