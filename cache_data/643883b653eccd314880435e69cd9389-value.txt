    "etymology": "The particle と originally indicated a close connection or association between two things. Its use as 'with' evolved from this sense of connection, indicating that two or more entities are involved together in an action or share a common characteristic.",
    "writeup": "The particle と indicates a relationship between two nouns. It commonly translates to \"with,\" signifying that both or all people/objects are equally involved in an action. This mutual involvement distinguishes it from に, which highlights one person as the target of an action. と denotes a reciprocal action or state, implying that multiple parties are jointly participating or being compared.",
