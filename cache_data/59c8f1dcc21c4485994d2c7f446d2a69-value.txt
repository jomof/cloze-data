        "Function": "Expressing inability despite desire or effort.",
        "Nuance": "Implies a strong desire or intention to do something, contrasted with the inability to carry it out.",
        "Typical Use": "Used to explain why an action was not or could not be performed, often due to external circumstances or internal limitations.",
        "Alternatives": "Can be replaced with 「たくても〜ない」or「〜たいけど〜ない」 in some contexts, although the nuance may differ slightly."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point combines 「よう」 (volitional form of a verb, expressing intention) with 「にも」 (even though, despite), and a negative predicate 「ない」, to convey the meaning of 'even though I want/try, I cannot'.",
    "writeup": "The 「ようにも(〜ない)」 grammar point expresses the idea that even though someone wants to do something, they cannot. It indicates a strong desire or intention that is thwarted by circumstances, limitations, or external factors. The nuance is one of frustration or regret due to this inability. This grammar is often used to provide an explanation or justification for why an action was not taken, emphasizing the desire to act but the impossibility of doing so.",
