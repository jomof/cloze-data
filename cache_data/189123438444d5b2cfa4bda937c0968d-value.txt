    },
    "jlpt": "N0",
    "meaning": "If luck is on my side, if the time is right, if possible, all going well.",
    "etymology": "「あわよくば」is derived from the older expression 「あわよい」, meaning 'convenient' or 'timely', combined with the conditional particle 「ば」. Essentially, it conveys the idea of \"if things go well at that time.\"",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Generally used in semi-formal to casual contexts.",
        "Usage": "Expresses a desire for a positive outcome, contingent on favorable circumstances. Often used when the speaker is hoping for something extra or unexpected."
    },
    "writeup": "「あわよくば」 is a combination of the old-fashioned い-Adjective 「あわよい」 \"convenient\", \"timely\", and the conjunction particle 「ば」 \"if\". It can be translated as \"if the time is right\", \"if possible\", or \"if luck is on my side\". Despite its roots, 「あわよくば」 is treated as a single word in modern Japanese and is used in the same way as a typical adverb. 「あわよくば」 will come before a phrase expressing a desirable outcome.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「あわよくば」 implies a degree of opportunism or wishful thinking.\n*   It is generally used when the speaker recognizes that the desired outcome is not guaranteed but hopes for the best.\n*   This grammar point is primarily used in speech, though it does appear in writing sometimes.\n\n**Fun Fact**\n\nNotice that 「ば」 attaches to the く form of the い-Adjective 「あわよい」 rather than 「けれ」, as would usually be required with modern conjugation rules. This is due to the conjugation rules for 「ば」 in relation to い-Adjectives being different in both classical and modern Japanese.",
