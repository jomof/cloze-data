  "writeup": "に決まっている is a forceful expression conveying the speaker's strong belief in the truth of something, even without definitive proof.  It implies certainty based on strong prior knowledge or common sense.  Translations often include 'surely,' 'bound to be,' or 'certainly.'  Structurally, it combines に and the ている-form of the u-verb 決まる (kimaru, 'to be decided'). Thus, a literal translation could be 'it is definitively decided to be (A)'.  This construction follows verbs, i-adjectives, na-adjectives, and nouns. Importantly, に決まっている reflects the speaker's subjective assessment, not necessarily objective facts.",
  "etymology": "The phrase originates from the verb 決まる (kimaru), meaning 'to be decided' or 'to be settled.'  The ている-form, 決まっている (kimatteiru), indicates a continuing state of being decided.  The particle に adds emphasis, suggesting a conclusive and inevitable outcome from the speaker's perspective.",

  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these phrases share similarities in expressing certainty,  the key difference lies in the source of that certainty. に決まっている stems from the speaker's firm subjective belief, while others rely on evidence or external factors. Choosing the right expression depends on whether you're expressing a gut feeling or a logical conclusion."
