    "etymology": "「は」 is a topic marker particle. 「もちろん」 means \"of course\" or \"naturally\". Together, they create the sense of something being obvious and then expanding on it.",
    "writeup": "「はもちろん」, sometimes written as 「は勿論」, introduces an obvious point (A), while also mentioning another relevant point (B). The particle 「は」 marks (A) as the topic, and 「もちろん」 emphasizes its obviousness. The sentence then proceeds to discuss (B), highlighting a shared quality or additional information. 「はもちろん」 is placed directly after noun (A). It translates to \"not only (A), but (B),\" \"not to mention (A), (B),\" or similar phrases. It's more formal than 「だけでなく」, so it might sound stiff in casual conversation unless used for emphasis.",
