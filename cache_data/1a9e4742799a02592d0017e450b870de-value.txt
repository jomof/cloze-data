    "writeup": "～は～となっている is a common expression used to show that **(A) is becoming (B)**, or (more commonly) **(A) has become (B)**. This expression will only appear with nouns, or な-Adjectives in their 語幹 (stem form). ～は～となっている is often translated as \"(A) happens to be (B),\" \"(A) has been established as (B),\" or \"it has been decided that (A) is (B).\" Let's have a look at some examples, and then how this structure is formed.\n\nDespite the different translations, (A) は (B)となっている always has the same underlying meaning, which can be understood as follows:\n\n*   **(A) は**: (A) is a constant unchanging thing.\n*   **(B) と**: (B) is a result. (coming from the case marking particle と's role in highlighting results.)\n*   **なっている**: (A) is existing in the state of 'having arrived at the result of (B)'.\n\nDue to this, the literal translation may be thought of as **\"it is now that (A) is (B)\"** in almost all situations.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   ～は～となっている may be rephrased to ～は～になっている. However, に will remove much of the feeling of a 'result' or 'finality'. Due to this, it will just sound like (A) is becoming (B), but is not necessarily that way yet.\n*   In writing, おる is not always considered a 'formal' equivalent of いる, especially in set phrases. となっている is often seen as となっており, instead of となっていて. This is particularly common in news articles.",
