  "writeup": "The noun 同志 (dōshi) meaning 'fellow' functions similarly to a suffix, conveying 'mutually,' 'fellow,' or 'together.'  Attach it directly to another noun before adding details about the mutual relationship.  Alternatively, the structure (noun + 同志 + の + noun) is common, indicating that the second noun is a group of the first.  同志 most often highlights 'people' or 'living things' sharing a relationship, less frequently inanimate objects.  While the 士 kanji means 'gentleman,' remember that the word's primary use is in the context of shared relationships among living beings.  Two main types of 'mutuality' are expressed:  種類 (shurui) – type (A is the same type as B), and 関係 (kankei) – relationship (A shares the same relationship as B).",
  "etymology": "The word 同志 (dōshi) is composed of two kanji: 同 (dō), meaning 'same,' and 志 (shi), meaning 'will,' 'aspiration,' or 'mind.'  Thus, the literal meaning points to individuals sharing the same will or aspiration, which is often the basis for camaraderie and mutual understanding.",

    {
      "japanese": "これは弁護士同士の話しなので勝手に入って来ないで下さい。",
      "english": "This is a conversation between lawyers, so please don't barge in.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The polite register is appropriate for a formal setting such as this, instructing someone not to interrupt a conversation.  The phrase 「弁護士同士」 (bengoshi dōshi) clearly establishes the context of a professional discussion."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "家族同士で会話をするときはほとんど日本語です。",
      "english": "When we talk among family members, we mostly use Japanese.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses semi-formal language because the context is a general statement about family communication habits.  The phrase 「家族同士」 (kazoku dōshi) is used to establish a general context of 'within a family'."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼は友達同士の約束を破った。",
      "english": "He broke a promise made between friends.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "storytelling",
      "nuance": "The casual register is suitable for narrating a simple event; the use of 「友達同士」 (tomodachi dōshi) provides a clear focus on a peer relationship. The sentence is natural and shows that the speaker and the listener understand the context."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "お互い大人同士なんだから、落ち着いて話し合おうよ。",

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "persuasive",

      "english": "You two are really alike.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The sentence is naturally spoken by a female speaker, given the use of the sentence-ending particle ね (ne). The phrase 「似たもの同士」 (nitamono dōshi) is used in a casual setting to emphasize the similarity of two individuals, often used by females."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "それは兄弟同士の問題でしょ？私を巻き込まないで。",
      "english": "That's a sibling issue, right? Don't involve me.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses casual Japanese because it is a conversational comment, likely made to a close friend or family member. The use of 「兄弟同士」 (kyoudai dōshi) to emphasize the context is very natural.  The use of the question mark and imperative are very natural for the setting."

    {
      "japanese": "この糊は紙同士だとよくくっつきますがプラスチック同士だとあまりくっつかないです。",
      "english": "This glue sticks well to paper, but not so well to plastic.",

      "setting": "instructive",
      "nuance": "Although less common, the use of 同志 with inanimate objects is acceptable in informative or instructional contexts. The polite form is chosen due to the instructional nature of the sentence.  The use of 「紙同士」(kami dōshi) and 「プラスチック同士」 (purasuchikku dōshi) is not common in everyday speech."

      "register": "informative",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The use of 「雄同士」(osudōshi) is used to specify that it is between males, because fighting between male giraffes is more common. This is a very natural sentence for an informative setting."

      "nuance": "The polite register is appropriate for giving instructions on appropriate language use. The explanation provides context by stating that 「家族や友達同士」(kazoku ya tomodachi dōshi) is appropriate when speaking to family or friends, while it is inappropriate in formal settings."
