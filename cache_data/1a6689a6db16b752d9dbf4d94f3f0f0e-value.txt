  "writeup": "ころ, or ごろ (the colloquial pronunciation), means 'around' or 'about.'  It's similar to くらい, but with key distinctions.  ごろ attaches to nouns, or nouns followed by の.  The crucial difference is that ころ often expresses a broad point in time, unlike くらい, which is more precise. Conversely, ころ isn't used for approximate distances or lengths because it signifies a span, while くらい indicates extent.  Think of it this way:  if you have a one-meter ruler, ころ could mean anywhere within that meter (the span), but くらい would pinpoint a section closer to the end of the ruler (the extent).  However, if the time is very specific, either くらい or ころ works naturally, as the span and extent essentially become a precise point.  Important Consideration: The kanji form 頃 is also very common; learn it to avoid confusion.",
