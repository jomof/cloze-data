        "[Verb stem] + 込む": "Indicates going into, putting into, or doing something thoroughly."

    "etymology": "The verb 「込む」 originally means \"to be crowded\" or \"to be packed.\" When used as a suffix, it retains the sense of something being forced or packed into something else, or doing something deeply and thoroughly.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「込む」, meaning \"to jam into,\" is frequently used as a suffix to convey several different meanings. Here, we focus on the primary meaning: to enter completely into doing something, or the state of being in something. This can be translated as \"to put into (A)\" or \"to go into (A).\" This form is attached to the conjunctive form (ます-stem) of other verbs.\n\nDespite the multiple meanings, 「込む」 can almost always be thought of as \"jamming (B) into (A).\" This means the (A) action will be something not easily entered, but also not easily escaped from.",
