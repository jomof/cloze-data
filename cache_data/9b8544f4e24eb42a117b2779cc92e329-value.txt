  "writeup": "The emphatic phrase とは比べものにならない emphasizes that something is far superior to something else, beyond any reasonable comparison.  It's a powerful way to express a significant difference in quality, quantity, or some other measurable feature.  The structure combines the case-marking particle と, the adverbial particle は, the compound noun 比べもの ('a comparable thing'), the particle に, and the negative form of the u-verb なる ('to become'), ならない.  Essentially, it states that '(A) cannot be considered a comparable thing.' This phrase precedes the noun representing the incomparable item.  The lack of specific quantification adds to its emphatic nature; the sheer magnitude of the difference is implied. In some cases, as seen in the examples, は is used a second time before ならない, reinforcing the emphasis and highlighting the contrast.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* This construction is inherently emphatic and should only be used when a significant difference exists.\n* It's common to use this phrase with nouns denoting things easily measurable, like speed or quality.\n* While grammatically flexible, the core meaning remains consistent across its usages.\n\n**Etymology:** 比べもの itself is a compound word, combining the conjunctive form of the verb 比べる ('to compare') and the noun もの ('thing').",
