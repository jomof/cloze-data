    "writeup": "「最中に」 (saichuu ni) emphasizes that something happens **right in the middle** of another action or event. 「最中」 literally means \"utmost middle,\" highlighting that the interruption or event occurs at the peak or most intense part of the ongoing action. It's similar to saying \"at the height of\" or \"in the midst of\" something. Typically, the sentence will highlight an interruption of the ongoing action. It attaches to the te-form of a verb or a noun followed by 「の」. While 「最中に」 can occasionally be used with adjectives, it's uncommon and generally refers to the pinnacle of a feeling or emotion.",
    "etymology": "The kanji 「最」 means \"utmost\" or \"most,\" and 「中」 means \"middle\" or \"center.\" Together, 「最中」 literally translates to \"utmost middle,\" emphasizing the peak or height of an activity when something else occurs.",
