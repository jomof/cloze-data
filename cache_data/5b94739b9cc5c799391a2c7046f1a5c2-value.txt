  "writeup": "だけましだ is a set phrase expressing relief in a negative situation, conveying the sentiment \"at least...\" or \"it's better than...\".  It's frequently used when things aren't ideal, but could be far worse. This structure combines the particle だけ 'only' and the na-adjective 増し (mashi), meaning 'better' or 'preferable'.  増し is the conjunctive form of the u-verb 増す (masu), meaning 'to increase' or 'to grow'.  Therefore, the literal meaning hints at \"even just (A) is a plus, compared to what could have been.\" だけましだ typically follows verbs, i-adjectives, or na-adjectives (with な).  While まし is usually written in hiragana, katakana マシ is also seen, often emphasizing gratitude.  Note:  While less common, だけまだましだ (dakemmada mashida) strengthens the meaning by adding まだ 'still'.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's core, 増し (mashi), originates from the verb 増す (masu), meaning 'to increase.'  Its conjunctive form, expressing a comparative sense of improvement, perfectly suits the phrase's function of highlighting a positive aspect within a negative context. The combination with だけ ('only') further emphasizes the limited, yet appreciated, positive element.",
