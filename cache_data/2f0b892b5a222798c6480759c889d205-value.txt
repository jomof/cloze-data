    "etymology": "The grammar point 「まい」 is derived from the negative volitional form of verbs in classical Japanese. It's a formal way to express a negative intention or a strong sense of improbability.",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb 「まい」 is used to express **negative volition** or a **strong sense of improbability**. It attaches to the **base form** of a verb.  「まい」 is considered a **formal** expression and often conveys a sense of determination not to do something or a strong feeling that something is unlikely to happen. It can be translated as \"won't,\" \"intend not to,\" or \"probably not.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「まい」 is the negative counterpart to the volitional forms 「う」 and 「よう」.\n*   When used with the verbs 「する」 (to do) and 「来る」 (to come), you'll often see variations like 「しまい」、「すまい」、「きまい」, and 「こまい」 in addition to the standard 「するまい」 and 「来るまい」.",
