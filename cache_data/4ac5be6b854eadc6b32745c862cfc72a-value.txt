  "writeup": "お〜する is a humble verb form used in Japanese to express actions performed by the speaker in a self-deprecating and polite manner.  It's a crucial element of keigo (honorific speech), specifically humble speech (kenjōgo), showing respect for the listener by downplaying one's own actions.  This contrasts with honorific language (sonkeigo), which elevates the listener's actions. お〜する typically attaches to verbs of Japanese origin, while ご〜する is used with verbs of Chinese origin.  The する attaches directly to the masu-stem of most verbs.  However, for verbs already ending in する, the prefix changes to ご, not ごする.  Rare exceptions exist where お is used with words of Chinese origin, but these are usually very common verbs and easily learned through exposure.  This humble form, お〜する, is a more common and natural alternative to いたす, which is a less frequently used, more formal synonym.",
