  "etymology": "「を」 is a case marker indicating the object. 「元 (もと)」 means 'origin', 'base', or 'source'. 「に」 is a particle indicating a direction or purpose.  Therefore, literally, 「をもとに」 means 'taking something as the origin'.",
  "writeup": "The grammar point 「をもとに」 (o moto ni) attaches to a noun and signifies that something is **based on**, **derived from**, or **according to** that noun. Think of it as saying \"with (something) as the origin.\" While often written in hiragana (をもとに), it can also appear as を元に.  This structure frequently appears with verbs of creation or production, such as 書く (kaku - to write), できる (dekiru - to be able to be made), and 作る (tsukuru - to make).  It highlights the source material or initial point from which something develops.\n\n**Important Consideration:**  Distinguish 「をもとに」 from 「に基づいて」 (ni motozuite), which also means \"based on.\" While both indicate a foundation, 「に基づいて」 emphasizes a formal basis for judgment or conclusions, like laws or regulations.  「をもとに」 leans more towards a source of inspiration or the raw material for something new.",
