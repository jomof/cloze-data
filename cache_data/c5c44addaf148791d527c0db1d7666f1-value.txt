    "etymology": "The particle 「へ」, indicating direction, combines with the verb 「行く」 (iku), meaning \"to go.\"",
    "writeup": "「へ行く」is a common construction used when describing a place that someone/something is \"heading\". The particles 「に」and 「へ」are mostly interchangeable, but there is a slight difference in nuance. 「に」has the nuance of \"going to\", while 「へ」has the nuance of \"heading to\". While they may seem the same at first glance, 「へ」focuses much more on the journey, while 「に」puts more emphasis on the destination. This is true for other uses of 「に」and 「へ」as well. 「に」will always put more focus on the destination of an action, where 「へ」will put more emphasis on the distance traveled/between the origin and destination.",
