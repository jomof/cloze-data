    "etymology": "The term 「い-Adjectives」 comes from the fact that these adjectives always end with the hiragana 「い」 in their dictionary form. This 「い」 is an integral part of the adjective and changes when the adjective is conjugated.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, い-Adjectives (い形容詞, *i-keiyōshi*) are a class of adjectives that end in い in their dictionary form. They are also called \"form containing words\" (用言, *yōgen*). They directly modify nouns, for example: 「新しい車」 (a new car). \n\n**Important Considerations**\n*   Not all words ending in い are い-Adjectives. For example, 「きれい」 (pretty) looks like an い-Adjective but actually comes from the kanji 綺麗, where い is part of the kanji. Another example is 「嫌い」 (dislike). In い-Adjectives, the い is always outside of the kanji.\n*   There's no easy rule to distinguish non-い-Adjectives, but thankfully, there aren't many of them. Familiarity will come with exposure.\n*   Unlike な-Adjectives, い-Adjectives **must never** be followed by だ. だ is only for nouns (which な-Adjectives originally are). Use です to be polite, but note the caution below.\n*   Although using です with い-Adjectives is very common, it is technically incorrect. です is a polite form of だ, so it should only attach to nouns and な-Adjectives. However, most native speakers do not know this rule and consider its use natural.",
