    "etymology": "けれども is derived from the verb '蹴る' (keru, to kick) + the auxiliary verb 'ども' (domo, although/even if). The 'kick' aspect has been lost; it now only serves as a conjunctive particle.",
    "writeup": "けれども is a more formal version of けど. Like けど, it generally means \"but\" or \"although,\" but its formality makes it sound more like \"although\" or \"provided that.\" It emphasizes that you are \"thinking about (A), (B)\", highlighting the importance of phrase (B). だ is required after nouns and な-adjectives. \n\nHere's a list of \"but\" expressions from casual to formal:\n\nCasual: けど → けども → けれど → **けれども** → が: Formal\n\nOriginally, けれども was considered a more feminine version of が. However, the modern けど is so common that けれども has lost its feminine nuance.\n\nLike けど and other \"but\" expressions, the phrase after けれども can be omitted if it's obvious or the speaker doesn't want to state it directly.",
