  "writeup": "The particles を通じて (wo tsūjite) and を通して (wo tsūshite) are nuanced ways to express \"through,\" \"via,\" or \"throughout.\"  They indicate an indirect connection or means by which something happens.  While often used interchangeably, subtle differences exist.  Think of を通じて as emphasizing the *medium* or *channel* through which something occurs.  It suggests a more passive or unintentional process.  Conversely, を通して highlights the *active use* of a means or method to achieve a result; a more deliberate and intentional action. The core verbs, 通じる (tsūjiru, to go through/connect) and 通す (tsūsu, to pass through/allow to go through), are intransitive and transitive respectively, influencing the particle's usage.  Intransitive を通じて is more suited to things that happen *throughout* a period or situation. Mastering the subtle difference requires attention to the context and intentionality of the action.",

  "etymology": "Both particles derive from the verb 通る (tōru, to pass through) and 通す (tōsu, to make something pass through).  The て-form adds the nuance of the process or means.  The choice between -て and -て is influenced by the transitivity and intransitivity of the base verbs, impacting the meaning of 'through' as medium versus intentional method."
