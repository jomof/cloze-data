    "etymology": "じゃ is a contraction of では, which is the te-form of the copula だ (desu), followed by は (wa) used as a contrastive particle. なかった is the past negative form of the adjective ない (nai). Therefore, じゃなかった essentially means \"it was not the case that...\"",
    "writeup": "じゃなかった is the casual past negative form of the copula (である). It indicates that something \"was not\" something else. It's used to negate nouns and な-adjectives in the past tense in casual speech. The more polite equivalent is ではなかった. The contraction of では to じゃ is very common in Japanese. Remember that this form is added directly to the noun or な-adjective.",
