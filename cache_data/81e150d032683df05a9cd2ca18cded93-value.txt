  "writeup": "The adverbial phrase 今だに (imadani), often written in kanji as 未だに, conveys the sense of something continuing to the present moment or not yet having happened.  It implies a duration, suggesting that a state or action has persisted for a considerable time or hasn't commenced despite expectations.  While similar to まだ (mada, 'still'), 今だに carries a stronger nuance of duration and is generally considered more formal.  The 'ni' particle emphasizes the continuation or delay.  Think of it as adding a sense of 'despite the passage of time' or 'in spite of...' to the situation.  Mastering 今だに allows for more nuanced expressions of persistence and delay in Japanese.",
  "etymology": "未だ (imada) originates from the negative past form of the verb いまだ (imada), meaning 'to be still'.  The particle に (ni) further emphasizes the continuation or duration in time.",
