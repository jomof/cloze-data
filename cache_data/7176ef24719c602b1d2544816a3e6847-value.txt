    "etymology": "The grammar point is a combination of 「にも」 (even if) and 「ない」 (not). The doubled verb construction emphasizes the desire to do something versus the inability to do it. The pattern highlights a situation where effort or will is present, but external or internal limitations prevent the action.",
    "writeup": "The pattern 「にも〜ない」 expresses that despite wanting to do something, it's impossible. It combines the volitional form (う/よう) of a verb with its negated potential form. Literally, it means \"Even if I try to [verb], I cannot [verb].\" This implies that there are circumstances beyond the speaker's control preventing the action. It often refers to physical limitations. Similar grammar points like 「に〜ない」 paired with the dictionary form, tend to refer more to mental limitations. You'll often see the same verb repeated, in the volitional and the negative potential form. This grammar is primarily used in standard Japanese.",
