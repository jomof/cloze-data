  "etymology": "The verb 「来る (くる)」 has ancient roots in the Japanese language. Its origin can be traced back to the Old Japanese period. The core meaning has remained largely consistent throughout its history, always indicating movement towards the speaker or a specified location. The kanji itself is a pictograph representing a person coming towards you, further emphasizing the verb's primary meaning.",
  "writeup": "「来る (くる)」 is a fundamental verb meaning \"to come.\" It indicates movement toward the speaker's location or a place relevant to the speaker. Unlike regular verbs, 「来る」 is an irregular verb (変格活用), specifically a *ka*-column irregular verb (カ変動詞). This means its conjugation patterns differ significantly from standard *godan* and *ichidan* verbs. Instead of conjugating the 「る」, the 「く」 conjugates.\n\n*   「来る」 often appears with particles such as 「に」 or 「へ」 to specify the destination. For example, 「学校に来る (がっこう に くる)」 means \"to come to school.\"\n*   When describing the means of transportation, use 「で」. For example, 「バスで来る (バス で くる)」 means \"to come by bus.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「来ている (きている)」 can indicate both \"to be coming\" (progressive) and \"to be at a place one has come to\" (resulting state). Context is crucial to differentiate between the two meanings. This is due to 「ている」 meaning \"to exist in the state of an action.\"\n*   「来ている」 to mean 'to be somewhere that one has come' is only used for temporary locations. It is not used for places like home or work.",
