  "writeup": "ってば and ったら are emphatic sentence-final particles used primarily in casual Japanese conversation.  They express the speaker's insistence on their viewpoint or a sense of exasperation, often translating as \"I said!,\" \"I told you!,\" or similar exclamations. They're contractions of と言えば (to ieba, 'if one were to say') and と言ったら (to ittara, 'if one were to say'), respectively.  While literally meaning something like 'if it were said...', the nuance is closer to the English \"Didn't I tell you?!\" when used sarcastically or with frustration.  They can follow almost any word but require a だ (da) before them when attached to nouns or な-adjectives.  Note that ってば and ったら may sometimes directly follow nouns without だ. In these cases, the noun is usually a person, often the speaker themselves, expressing a playful or frustrated sentiment, such as 'oh, that (person)...', or 'that darn (person)...'.  This usage implies familiarity and a degree of affection, albeit potentially tinged with annoyance.",
  "examples": [

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「ってば」 to emphasize the speaker's prior statement, conveying mild frustration.  The use of 「むかつく」 (mukatsuku - to be annoyed) adds to the informal tone."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "痛いったら！なんでずっと痛いって言ってるのに何回も何回もフォークでつついてくるの？",
      "english": "I told you it hurts! Why do you keep poking me with a fork even though I've said it hurts repeatedly?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The repeated use of 「痛い」 (itai - hurts) reinforces the speaker's annoyance.  「ったら」 emphasizes this feeling and underscores the listener's inconsiderateness."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "嫌いだってば！あんな奴なんて大嫌いだ！",
      "english": "I said I hate them! I absolutely hate that kind of person!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The strong feeling is clearly expressed by 「大嫌いだ」(daikirai da - I hate them intensely). The use of 「ってば」 shows that this is not the first time this dislike is mentioned. The intensity of dislike is expressed by the use of だ (da)."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "だから、俺は大人だってば！背が低いからってひどいぞ本当に。",
      "english": "I told you I'm an adult! That's really mean just because I'm short.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "persuasive",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The speaker employs 「ってば」 to emphasize their point and express frustration at the unfair treatment due to their height.  The 「だから」(dakara - therefore) shows a prior discussion, and the complaint 「ひどいぞ」(hidoi zo - that's mean!) shows the speaker's annoyance."

    {
      "japanese": "金太郎ってば、またエアコンつけっぱなしで家出てったよ。",
      "english": "That darn Kintaro left the air conditioner on again!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The 「ってば」 attached to the name 「金太郎」(Kintaro) suggests a familiar yet slightly exasperated tone, implying a history of such behavior. It softens the overall tone of the sentence, even though it is about someone leaving the AC running."

    {
      "japanese": "あなたったら本当におっちょこちょいね。",
      "english": "Oh, you're such a clutz!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "「あなたったら」(anata ttara) is used to address a person the speaker knows well, showing closeness and affection, even when using the word 「おっちょこちょい」(occhocochoi - clutz), which is not necessarily a compliment."

    {
      "japanese": "ねえ、私と付き合わない？ってば♡",

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The 「ってば」 adds a playful and slightly demanding tone, which combined with the heart emoji, is used to imply a flirtatious, almost teasing approach.  The use of 「ねえ」(nee - hey) is an inherently feminine speech pattern."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "君の笑顔、素敵だよってば。",
      "english": "Your smile is so lovely.",
      "register": "casual",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The 「ってば」 softens the compliment, making it sound less formal and more approachable.  This is a classic example of how the particle can add a hint of playful flirtation to an otherwise simple expression."

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, ってば and ったら are highly informal and should only be used with close friends or family. Using them in formal settings would sound extremely unnatural and inappropriate.",
  "etymology": "The particles ってば and ったら are contractions of と言えば (to ieba) and と言ったら (to ittara), respectively.  Both phrases literally translate to something like 'if it were said...' but their modern usage has evolved into emphatic sentence-final particles.  Their evolution demonstrates how even seemingly simple particles can evolve in meaning over time."
