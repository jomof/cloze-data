  "writeup": "The grammar point 「代わりに・かわりに」 (kawari ni) is used to indicate that something or someone is acting as a substitute or replacement for something else. It can be used with nouns, verbs, and adjectives.\n\n*   **With Nouns:** 「Noun + の代わりに」 means \"instead of [noun]\" or \"in place of [noun].\"\n*   **With Verbs/Adjectives:** 「Verb/Adjective (plain form) + 代わりに」 means \"instead of [doing something]\" or \"in exchange for [something being a certain way].\" It often implies a sense of compensation or trade-off. For example, doing one thing in place of another, or accepting a negative aspect in return for a positive one.\n\nIt is similar to けど(も) and しかし in the sense that they indicate a contrast, but 代わりに implies a direct substitution, compensation, or exchange.",
