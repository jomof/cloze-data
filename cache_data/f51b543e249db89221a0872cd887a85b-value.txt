  "writeup": "The Japanese expression 〜かは〜によって違う translates to \"Whether it's A or B depends on...\".  It's a nuanced way to express dependency.  Let's break it down:  〜かは represents \"whether...or not\" or \"whether A or B.\"  〜によって is \"depending on,\" and 違う means \"differs\" or \"is different.\"  The entire phrase indicates that the truth of the first part (A or B) is contingent on the circumstances expressed in the second part.  The construction is versatile and can be adjusted slightly, using どうか instead of か to modify the nuance.  This phrase is commonly used in everyday conversation and writing across various contexts. ",
  "etymology": "This phrase combines several established grammatical elements in Japanese.  '〜か' indicates a choice or question,  '〜は' marks the topic, '〜によって' shows dependence or causality (using the 'ni yotte' form,  derived from 'yoru'), and '違う' is a common verb signifying difference.  The combination is a natural evolution of these elements, reflecting the fluid nature of Japanese sentence structure.",
