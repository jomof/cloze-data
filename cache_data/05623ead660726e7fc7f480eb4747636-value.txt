  "writeup": "そうすると, a combination of そう (an adverb meaning 'like that', or 'as such'), する (to do), and the conjunction particle と, expresses that 'once (A) was done, (B)', or 'upon (A), (B)'. そうすると is usually used at the beginning of a new sentence, to highlight something that occurred due to the circumstances mentioned in the previous sentence/statement. As a stand-alone statement, そうすると is classified as a conjunction.  Important Considerations: The 'result' that そうすると conveys should always be one of two specific things: something the speaker has no control over, or a conclusion/determination the speaker wants to confirm is correct (based on their understanding of the previous statement). When そうすると is used to draw a conclusion about another person's statement, the translation is closer to 'so you mean to say (A)', or 'if so, then (A)'.  Fun Fact: Although 然う has a kanji form, this particular word is almost always written in hiragana. This is true for many expressions using そう, not just そうすると.",
  "etymology": "The phrase そうすると is a combination of the adverb そう (sou, 'like that'), the verb する (suru, 'to do'), and the particle と (to, 'and then').  The adverb そう originates from the verb 然う (shiranu), meaning 'to be so' or 'to be like that'. Over time, it has evolved into its modern form. The particle と functions as a conjunction, indicating a consequence or result.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "もう少しゆっくり走ってみれば。**そうすると**、もっと長い距離走れるよ。",
      "english": "Try running a little slower. Then you'll be able to run a longer distance.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「よ」 at the end of the sentence makes it a casual and encouraging statement, suitable for a friendly setting between peers or close friends. The suggestion to run slower is presented as a means to achieve a specific outcome, reflecting the causal nature of そうすると."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "食べる前に軽く炙って。**そうすると**、もっと美味しくなるよ。",
      "english": "Lightly broil it before eating. Then it'll be more delicious.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register is appropriate for an informal setting, such as giving instructions to a friend or family member.  The use of 「よ」 again indicates informality and closeness. The sentence structure is clear and direct, emphasizing the cause-and-effect relationship. The use of the te-form of 炙る (aburu) shows the action that needs to be performed first."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この餌を使ってみたら？**そうすると**、もっと大きな魚が釣れるかもしれないよ。",
      "english": "Try using this bait? Then maybe you'll catch a bigger fish.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「かもしれない」 adds a playful uncertainty, fitting a flirtatious tone. 「よ」 further softens the command, making it more suggestive than directive.  The male speaker is offering a potentially rewarding outcome (catching a bigger fish) as an implied incentive to the female listener, suggesting a playful competition or a shared activity."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "明日、一緒に映画を見に行かない？**そうすると**、もっと仲良くなれるかもしれないよ。",
      "english": "Want to go see a movie together tomorrow?  Then maybe we can get to know each other better.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The female speaker uses 「かもしれない」 to express a hopeful expectation, appropriate for a tentative romantic interaction. 「よ」 softens the suggestion, making it seem less forceful. The invitation and the hopeful outcome are clearly linked using そうすると."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "会議を1時間遅らせましょう。**そうすると**、全員が参加できます。",
      "english": "Let's postpone the meeting by one hour. Then everyone will be able to participate.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite form 「ましょう」 is used for making a suggestion to a group, suitable for a professional setting.  The sentence conveys a clear cause-and-effect relationship in a professional and considerate manner."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "このボタンを押してください。**そうすると**、機械が起動します。",
      "english": "Please press this button. Then the machine will start.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite imperative 「ください」 is appropriate for giving instructions to someone of higher status or in a more formal setting. The clear and concise explanation of the procedure emphasizes the direct causal relationship between pressing the button and the machine starting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "来年、結婚する予定です。**そうすると**、子供も出来るかもしれませんね。",
      "english": "We plan to get married next year. Then maybe we'll have a child.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "intimate",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The semi-formal register is suitable for a personal conversation between close friends or family. 「ね」 softens the statement, making it more conversational and less declarative. The sentence presents the possibility of having a child as a natural consequence of getting married. "
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Note that the meaning of そうすると subtly shifts depending on context. It can emphasize the inevitability of a consequence or the speaker's reasoned conclusion. Pay attention to the nuance of each situation and the words used in conjunction with そうすると to fully grasp its implied meaning.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "すると",
      "meaning": "then, thereupon, in that case",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While often used interchangeably with そうすると in casual settings, すると lacks the nuanced implication of a cause-and-effect relationship stemming from a prior action or statement."
    },
    {
      "term": "と (quotation)",
      "meaning": "If, When, Whenever, And, [Conditional]",
      "kind": "similar particle",
      "nuance": "The particle と can also express a conditional relationship, but it focuses solely on the condition itself, without the same emphasis on the consequence as そうすると."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that そうすると explicitly links a preceding action or statement to a subsequent event or conclusion.  すると is a simpler statement of sequence. と, as a particle, is conditional but lacks the consequential emphasis of そうすると.  Context and sentence structure are key to selecting the most appropriate expression."
