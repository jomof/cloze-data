  "writeup": "The adverb 全然 (ぜんぜん) literally translates to \"completely,\" but its usage is nuanced. Traditionally, it modifies negative verbs, conveying the sense of \"not at all.\"  For example,  \"全然食べない\" (ぜんぜんたべない) means \"I don't eat at all.\"  However,  in modern, particularly younger generations' speech, 全然 is increasingly used with positive verbs, indicating \"completely\" or \"totally.\"  This usage, while technically grammatically 'incorrect' according to traditional rules, is now widely accepted in casual conversation.  The key is context; the meaning shifts depending on whether it's paired with a negative or positive verb.  Think of it as an intensifier—a way to emphasize the completeness of the action (or lack thereof).  While similar to まったく (mattaku), 全然 tends to sound softer and more casual.  Moreover, using 全然 with a positive verb is characteristic of younger generations, and would sound strange or out of place coming from an older speaker.  This shift in usage reflects the evolving nature of the Japanese language.",
  "etymology": "While the exact etymology is complex and debated, 全然 (ぜんぜん) likely derives from the combination of 全 (ぜん, all, entire) and 然 (ぜん, thus, so). The combination suggests a complete state of being or action.",

Pay attention to nuance and the overall tone of your communication."
