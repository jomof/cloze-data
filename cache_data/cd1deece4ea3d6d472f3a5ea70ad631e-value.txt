    "writeup": "風 (ふう) is a suffix in Japanese that means \"style of\", \"way of\", or \"fashion of\".  Think of it like saying \"-esque\" in English. You attach 風 to a noun to indicate that something resembles or is in the style of that noun. For example, 「アメリカ風料理」 means \"American-style cooking\". You can also use の between 風 and another noun to further specify the style, as in 「メキシコ風の料理」 (Mexican-style cooking). **Important:** When used as a suffix, 風 is always pronounced 「ふう」, not 「かぜ」 (the word for 'wind').",
