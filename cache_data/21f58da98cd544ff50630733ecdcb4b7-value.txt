  "writeup": "The particle やら (yara) is an adverbial particle expressing a lack of definitive determination or limitation regarding the preceding element.  It's similar to など (nado) and often translates as '(A) and so on' or '(A) and the like'.  やら can follow verbs in their dictionary form, nouns, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives.  Its repetition, as in (A)やら(B)やら, typically involves (A) and (B) being of the same word type, though not always.  When compared to とか (toka), やら places stronger emphasis on the scope of items within the category of (A) and (B), suggesting they're merely a small part of a larger, more complex set of emotions, actions, etc.  A cautionary note: When used as のやら～のやら, it highlights the speaker's uncertainty about whether (A) or (B) is correct, presenting both as potential possibilities.  Therefore, (A) and (B) often—but not always—represent antonyms or opposites.",
  "pronunciation": {
    "katakana": "ヤラ～ヤラ",
    "romaji": "yara yara"
  },
  "etymology": "The etymology of やら is somewhat obscure, but it's believed to be related to the verb やる (yaru, 'to do'). Its usage as a particle evolved over time, signifying an indeterminate or incomplete enumeration of things, hence its current meaning of 'and so on' or 'and the like'.",

      "english": "I'm busy every day with things like taking care of the kids and doing housework.",
      "register": "teineigo",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses polite language「です」 (desu) typical in formal settings, reflecting the speaker's consideration for the listener.  The use of 「毎日」 (mainichi, 'every day') and specific tasks creates a clear picture for the listener."

      "japanese": "先週は身体中が痛いやら、体調が悪いやらで大変でした。",

      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,

      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual style is suitable for a close friend or family member,  creating a relaxed conversational tone. The use of 「色々な感情」 (iroiro na kanjou, 'various emotions') makes the statement more relatable and less clinical."

      "english": "You should study not just grammar, but also kanji and vocabulary, and so on.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This advice is given in a more direct and straightforward manner, suggesting a teacher-student or mentor-mentee dynamic.  The structure of the sentence itself—advising the listener—helps convey the semi-formal register."

    {
      "japanese": "彼女は大学に行くのやら行かないのやらはっきりしない。",

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「はっきりしない」 (hakkirisinai, 'isn't clear') emphasizes the uncertainty, while the casual phrasing suits a conversation among friends. The structure shows the speaker's uncertainty—not knowing which of the two options is the truth."

    {
      "japanese": "彼に褒めてもらうとうれしいやら恥ずかしいやら、とにかく気持ちがよかったわ。",

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of  「わ」 (wa) at the end is a typical feminine sentence ending. The sentence focuses on the speaker's feelings, making it intimate and suitable for close friends. The contrasting emotions 「うれしい」 (ureshii, 'happy') and 「恥ずかしい」 (hazukashii, 'embarrassed') make it a more nuanced and evocative expression of complex emotions."

    {
      "japanese": "あの映画は、戦闘シーンやら冒険シーンやらがあるから、君も見てみたらいいよ。",
      "english": "That movie has battle scenes, adventure scenes, and so on, you should watch it!",

    }

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the nuance.  や and とか offer simple lists,  たり～たりする focuses on actions, while ～ても～なくても is about presence/absence.  やら～やら is unique in emphasizing the incompleteness, multiplicity, or uncertain emotional state of the speaker when describing a range of things."
