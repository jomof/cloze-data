  "writeup": "The suffix さ (sa) in Japanese transforms い-adjectives and な-adjectives into nouns representing the degree or amount of the adjective.  It's often translated as '-ness' in English (e.g., 'sweetness,' 'tallness').  Think of it as expressing the 'quality' of an adjective in a noun form.  This is a versatile suffix and commonly used in everyday conversations across all ages and genders. Importantly, it's crucial to understand that while '-ness' provides a useful approximation, it doesn't always perfectly capture the nuanced meaning in Japanese.  The 'amount' or 'degree' concept is key.  Historically, the suffix is believed to have originated from the kanji 差 (sa, meaning 'difference' or 'distinction'), originally highlighting distinctive qualities. While there are archaic uses that show a connection to 'at the time of...', this is almost entirely poetic and extremely uncommon in contemporary Japanese.",
