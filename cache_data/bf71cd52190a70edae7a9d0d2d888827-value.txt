  "writeup": "とうとう is an adverb expressing that something finally happens after a period of anticipation or effort.  It's derived from the kanji 到頭 (tōtō), literally meaning \"to arrive at the head/crux of.\" This reflects the nuance of something concluding, often after a journey or struggle.  While commonly written in hiragana, understanding the kanji clarifies its meaning.  It can convey both positive and negative outcomes, emphasizing the *time* taken rather than the result's inherent value.  Important Considerations:  とうとう shouldn't be used when something happens naturally without prior effort, such as seasonal changes. In such cases, いよいよ (iyoyo) is more appropriate, conveying 'finally' in the sense of something beginning or occurring naturally. ",
  "etymology": "The word とうとう comes from the kanji 到頭 (tōtō).  到 (tō) means 'to arrive' and 頭 (tō) means 'head' or 'the crux of the matter.'  Therefore, the literal meaning is 'to finally arrive at the point,' implying a culmination after some period of time and effort.",
