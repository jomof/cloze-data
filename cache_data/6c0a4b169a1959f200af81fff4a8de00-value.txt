  "writeup": "The suffix がち (gachi) in Japanese, attached to nouns or verb conjunctive forms, indicates a tendency or propensity towards a certain action or state.  While not inherently negative, it frequently describes undesirable habits or inclinations.  It's important to note that がち doesn't express certainty; it suggests a likelihood or recurring pattern.  A fascinating etymological point: がち derives from 勝ち (kachi), meaning 'win.'  In this context,  勝ち implies something that 'repeats' or 'prevails,' making がち akin to an outcome that frequently 'wins out' among various possibilities. This 'winning out' may stem from preference, chance, or circumstance.  For instance,  \"テレビを見がち\" implies that watching TV is a common outcome under the specified circumstances.",
  "etymology": "The grammar point がち originates from the word 勝ち (kachi), meaning \"win.\"  This etymology explains why がち often implies a recurring or habitual tendency, as if a particular action or state 'wins out' in a series of potential outcomes. The shift in meaning reflects the evolution of language where a word's core meaning subtly changes over time based on usage.",
