  "etymology": "からには is a combination of three particles: から (kara, from), に (ni, in/at/to/on), and は (wa, topic marker).  The combination creates a nuanced meaning beyond the literal components.  The に functions here as an emphatic particle, intensifying the 'from' aspect of から, highlighting the starting point or basis for the subsequent action or statement. は marks the topic, setting the scene for the logical consequence that follows.",
  "writeup": "からには is a sophisticated Japanese expression conveying a sense of inevitability or logical consequence based on a preceding condition.  It's often translated as \"since,\" \"as long as,\" or \"given that.\"  The nuance lies in the speaker's implication that the outcome is a natural or determined result of the initial state.  It implies a commitment or acceptance of the consequence. Unlike simpler cause-and-effect structures, からには suggests a conscious decision based on the circumstances.  For example, 'Since I've already started this project, I'll finish it.' implies both an initial state and the speaker's determined response. The use of からには adds a subtle layer of determination, acceptance of the condition and responsibility for the outcome.  It's a more mature and nuanced way of expressing a cause-and-effect relationship than simpler alternatives.",

      "japanese": "沖縄に来た**からには**、一番綺麗なビーチへ行きたい。",
      "english": "Since I've come to Okinawa, I want to go to the most beautiful beach.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses \"沖縄に来た\" (Okinawa ni kita) to establish the premise, and \"一番綺麗なビーチへ行きたい\" (ichiban kirei na bi-chi e ikitai) expresses the speaker's desire as the logical consequence.  The casual register is appropriate for a personal statement."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "このスマホは高い**からには**、便利な機能がたくさん搭載されているはずだ。",
      "english": "Since this smartphone is expensive, it should have lots of convenient features.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses \"このスマホは高い\" (kono sumaho wa takai) as the premise, and \"便利な機能がたくさん搭載されているはずだ\" (benri na kinou ga takusan touzai sa rete iru hazu da) provides a logical inference.  The semi-formal register works well for expressing a reasoned opinion."

      "japanese": "彼と結婚する**からには**、彼の家族とも仲良くやっていかなければならない。",
      "english": "Since I'm marrying him, I have to get along with his family too.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of \"彼と結婚する\" (kare to kekkon suru) emphasizes the commitment, setting the stage for the speaker's acceptance of the consequent duty. \"結婚する\" is a choice made by the speaker, adding nuance to her resolve."

      "setting": "optimistic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The phrase \"こんなに頑張った\" (konna ni ganbatta) highlights the speaker's effort, the reason for their belief in a positive outcome, \"良い結果が出ると信じている\" (yoi kekka ga deru to shinjite iru)."

      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal register, including \"所存です\" (shozon desu), is suitable for a professional context. \"社長に昇進した\" (shachou ni shoushin shita) sets up the formal tone of commitment and responsibility."

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The intimate register is clear in the use of \"あなたと付き合う\" (anata to tsuki au) and the softer, less demanding phrasing of the wish with \"ほしいな\" (hoshii na). The speaker's possessive tone underscores the nature of this flirty request."

    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the nuance changes subtly depending on the context and the subsequent clause. The key is the feeling of determination, acceptance, and responsibility following the initial state.  Remember to practice forming your own sentences using からには in various contexts.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these expressions share some semantic overlap with からには, they lack its nuanced implication of determined acceptance and the responsibility for the speaker's response to the condition. Pay close attention to the context and the speaker's implied attitude to choose the most fitting expression."
