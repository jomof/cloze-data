    "writeup": "The grammar point 「と来(き)たら」 is used to introduce a topic and express a speaker's immediate thought or feeling about it. It's similar to saying \"When it comes to...\" or \"Concerning...\". The structure is 「[Topic] + と来たら + [Comment/Feeling]」. The 「と」 is a particle, and 「来たら」 is the conditional form of the verb 「来る (くる)」, literally meaning \"if it comes to.\" It's used to present a topic, with the rest of the sentence indicating the speaker's first instinctive thoughts or feelings about that topic. The relationship between the topic and the speaker's thoughts is often implied as obvious or taken for granted. You'll often see it used with words like 「やっぱり」 or 「やはり」, meaning \"as expected\" or \"sure enough.\"",
