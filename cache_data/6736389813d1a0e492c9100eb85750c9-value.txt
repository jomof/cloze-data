    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないまでも」 is a combination of the negative form 「ない」 of a verb or adjective, the particle 「まで」 indicating 'until' or 'to the extent of', and the adverbial particle 「も」, meaning 'even'. Thus, literally, it conveys the idea of 'even if not reaching the point of.'",
    "writeup": "「ないまでも」 indicates that while something may not reach an extreme or ideal state (A), a lesser state (B) is still true or desirable. It's often translated as \"even though not (A), (B)\" or \"it may not be (A), but (B).\" The structure presents a situation where (A) is a high expectation or extreme, but even if that isn't achieved, (B) remains a valid or important consideration. 「ないまでも」 can be used with both positive and negative outcomes. For example, (A) could be the best possible result, while (B) is a slightly less desirable but still acceptable outcome. Conversely, (A) could be the worst-case scenario, while (B) is a less severe, but still negative situation. The (B) phrase often expresses a wish, intention, or request, using structures like 「たい」, 「てほしい」, 「てください」, 「たらどう」, 「つもり」, or 「といい」.",
