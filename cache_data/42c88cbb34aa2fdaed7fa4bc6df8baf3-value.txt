  "writeup": "“幸い・幸いなことに” (sai/sai na koto ni) translates to \"Luckily,\" or \"Fortunately.\"  This expression is commonly used to preface a statement describing a fortunate event.  The core is the adjective 幸い (sai), meaning \"lucky\" or \"fortunate.\"  The addition of な (na) creates the na-adjective form, 幸いな (sai na), making it more versatile grammatically.  The phrase then adds こと (koto), meaning \"thing,\" and に (ni), a particle indicating that the preceding element is the subject of the following clause.  This structure emphasizes the fortunate aspect of the event. The difference between 幸い and 幸いなことに is largely stylistic, with 幸いなことに tending towards a more formal and slightly emphatic tone.  Both are widely used.",
  "etymology": "幸い (sai) originates from the kanji 幸 (kou), meaning happiness or good fortune, and い (i), a suffix often used to form adjectives.  The addition of な (na) follows standard na-adjective formation rules.  こと (koto) and に (ni) are common particles with established usage; their role here serves to emphasize the fortunate nature of the described event.",

      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The phrase 「彼の優しさに触れられた」 subtly suggests a deeper connection, adding a layer of romantic implication to the sentence.  The use of 「幸いなことに」 softens the potentially forward nature of the statement, making it more appropriate for a flirty context."

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The phrase 「彼女の笑顔を見ることができた」 expresses a positive feeling towards the listener. Using 「幸いにも」 adds a slightly more formal politeness and indirectness, avoiding any potential for over-familiarity."

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the nuance of “幸い・幸いなことに” comes from its placement at the sentence beginning and the generally positive connotation it brings to the statement that follows.  The level of formality (幸い vs 幸いなことに) can be adjusted for different contexts.",

      "term": "ことに",
      "meaning": "To my...; Especially; Extremely",
      "kind": "similar expression",
      "nuance": "Unlike 幸い・幸いなことに, which specifically focuses on fortunate circumstances, ことに amplifies a feeling or characteristic of the situation, irrespective of its fortunate or unfortunate nature.  It's used to emphasize the stated feeling, not necessarily the luck involved."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key distinction lies in the focus: 幸い emphasizes luck or fortune, while ことに emphasizes the intensity of a feeling or characteristic.  Choose 幸い when the emphasis is on the fortuitous nature of an event. Use ことに to intensify any particular emotion or quality, regardless of luck."
