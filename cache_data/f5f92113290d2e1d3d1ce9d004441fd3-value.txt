    "etymology": "The なり comes from the noun 形 (かたち), meaning \"shape\" or \"form.\" It implies that something remains in the same shape or state as it was after a certain action.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「たなり」 or 「たなりで」 indicates that a certain state continues after an action has taken place. It's similar to 「まま」 (as is) but often carries a stronger nuance of something being left in an undesirable or unexpected state. It is most commonly used in formal contexts. It is not used in casual conversation.\n\n*   It is often followed by a comma or the conjunctive form 「で」 of the auxiliary verb 「だ」.\n*   It can express the idea of \"ever since\" when a significant amount of time has passed.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   This 「なり」 is different from the classical copula 「なり」.\n*   The phrase 「たなりで」 is often used to emphasize the continuation of the state.",
