  "writeup": "The particles そんな, こんな, あんな, and どんな are versatile ways to express \"such a,\" \"kind of,\" or \"something like\" in casual Japanese conversation.  They're actually shortened forms—contractions, if you will—of the more formal expressions そのような, このような, あのような, and どのような, respectively.  Understanding this root helps explain their usage.  You place these particles directly before the noun you're describing.  While perfectly acceptable in most situations, the longer forms are preferred when greater politeness is needed.  The choice depends on the context and your relationship with the listener.",
  "etymology": "These words are contractions of longer, more formal phrases.  そんな (sonna) comes from そのような (sonoyōna), meaning 'that kind of'.  Similarly, こんな (konna) is from このような (konoyōna, 'this kind of'), あんな (anna) from あのような (anoyōna, 'that kind of'—referring to something distant from both speaker and listener), and どんな (donna) from どのような (donoyōna, 'what kind of'). This shows a clear evolution from formal to informal speech.",
