    "etymology": "The verb 「切る(きる)」 means 'to cut'. When attached to the stem of another verb, it retains the sense of severing or completing an action, often implying a sense of finality or exhaustion of resources.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「切る(きる)」, meaning \"to cut,\" can also be used as a suffix attached to the ます-stem of another verb. This usage gives the original verb the nuance of being done \"to completion.\" The completion conveyed by 「切る」 often implies the running out of some kind of resource, like energy. Thus, it is often translated as \"to do (A) to the point of being unable to continue\" or \"to totally and utterly do (A).\" Occasionally, 「切る」 may also be used to show that (A) is being done at \"full pelt,\" \"full steam,\" or \"full capacity.\" In these cases, it is similar to \"to resolutely do (A),\" indicating that 100% effort is being put into the action.",
