    "etymology": "The word 「もう」 originally meant \"again\" or \"more.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the idea of something being completed or no longer continuing, hence its meanings of \"already\" and \"anymore.\"",
    "writeup": "「もう」 is a versatile word that primarily translates to \"already\" in affirmative sentences and \"anymore\" in negative sentences. The core meaning stems from the idea that something has unexpectedly ended or reached a conclusion.\n\n*   In past tense affirmative sentences, 「もう」 indicates that an action has been completed sooner than expected, hence \"already.\"\n*   In negative sentences, 「もう」 signifies that a state or action that was expected to continue has ceased, hence \"anymore.\"\n*   「もう」 can also be used in questions to confirm if something has already happened, implying the speaker suspects it might have.",

            "speaker_age": "older",
            "listener_age": "younger",
            "nuance": "The 「か」 at the end of the sentence marks it as a question, seeking confirmation on whether the action of going to school has already taken place. The speaker suspects that it might have already happened. The use of polite form 「ましたか」 and the context imply an older person addressing a younger one.",
