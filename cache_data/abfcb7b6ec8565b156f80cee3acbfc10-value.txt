    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ことができる」 expresses the ability to do something. It is equivalent to \"can\" or \"be able to\" in English.  \n\nIt's formed by attaching 「こと」 to the dictionary form of a verb, followed by 「ができる」.  The 「こと」 nominalizes the verb, turning it into a noun phrase. However, when following a noun, 「ができる」 can be used directly without 「こと」, without changing the meaning.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「ことができる」 is often used to express general ability, while the potential form 「～れる/られる」 can sometimes imply that the action is possible under specific circumstances.\n*   While 「ことができる」 nominalizes the verb with 「こと」, the particle 「の」 can also be used for nominalization (「～のができる」). However, 「こと」 is generally preferred when a verb follows directly.\n\nExpressions using 「こと」 but *not* 「の」 include:\n*   「ことがある」 - For (A) to exist.\n*   「ことにする」 - To decide on something (A).\n*   「ことになる」 - For (A) to come to be.",
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「ことができる」 comes from combining the nominalizer 「こと」 (thing, event) with the potential verb 「できる」 (to be able to do, to be possible). Thus, literally it means \"the thing/event of doing is possible.\"",
