  "etymology": "「どの」 belongs to the same family of interrogative words as 「どれ」 (which one) and 「どこ」 (where). It specifies a choice from multiple options.",
  "writeup": "「どの」 is classified as a 連体詞 (*rentaishi*), a pre-noun adjectival, in Japanese. These words are unique in that they do not conjugate, meaning their form remains constant regardless of usage. They directly modify a noun that follows.\n\nThis grammar point originates from the same linguistic family as 「どれ」 and 「どこ」. Its primary function is to inquire about a choice from a group of items, specifically indicating \"which\" one. It can also extend its meaning to express notions like \"whatever\" or \"whichever\" in English.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「どの」 is fundamentally used when there are **three or more** possible choices available. When faced with only two options, one should employ 「どっち (の)」 or 「どちら (の)」 instead. For instance, if you are choosing between a red or blue item, 「どっち (の)」 is appropriate. However, if the choice is from a spectrum of colors, then 「どの」 is the correct interrogative.",
