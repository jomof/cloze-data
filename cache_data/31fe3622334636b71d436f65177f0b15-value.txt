    "formation": {
        "い-Adjective (て-form) + Phrase B": "Connects an い-adjective to another phrase, indicating a conjunction ('and') or reason ('because').  For い-adjectives, this involves conjugating the adjective to its て-form (e.g., 高い → 高くて).",
        "な-Adjective (で-form) + Phrase B": "Connects a な-adjective (or noun) to another phrase, indicating a conjunction ('and') or reason ('because'). For な-adjectives and nouns, this involves adding で (e.g., 静か → 静かで, 学生 → 学生で)."
    },
    "etymology": "The 'te' form used here originates from the conjunctive particle 「て」, which is also used with verbs to connect clauses.  For な-adjectives and nouns, 「で」 serves a similar function, acting as a conjunctive form of 「だ」 (the copula 'to be').",
    "writeup": "The て form of an い-adjective, or the で form of a な-adjective or noun, is similar to the て form of a verb, conveying the meaning of \"and\" and used for linking.  Instead of only linking adjectives, adjective + て/で + (B) connects an adjective or noun to an entire phrase. With this construction, the phrase is added after て (for い-adjectives) or で (for な-adjectives and nouns) without extra consideration, treating the following phrase as its own sentence.\n\nIt's **important** to note that while both structures use similar particles, て and で have slightly different origins. て is the conjunctive particle used with verbs, emphasizing the similarity between い-adjectives and verbs. で, on the other hand, is a conjugated form of だ, as seen in the more formal である.\n\nLike other て forms, the て/で form of adjectives and nouns has several possible meanings:\n\n*   Linking: Similar to \"and\" in English.\n*   Reasons: Similar to \"with (A)\" or \"because of (A)\" in English.\n*   Manner: Similar to \"to do (B) in an (A) way\" in English. Note that while this grammar point can describe manner, there may be other grammar points more suited for that specific context.",
