  "writeup": "とっくに, primarily seen as とっくに, is an adverb roughly translating to 'long ago' or 'already.'  It's an emphasized version of 疾うに (はやに), a literary form rarely used in modern Japanese.  とっくに is a sentence-altering adverb, usually appearing at the beginning or before the verb it modifies, indicating an action completed in the distant past. Compared to already (すでに) and now (もう), とっくに suggests a more distant past or serves as an exaggeration.  Interestingly, it's uncommon to see とっくに used with a specific time; the root word 疾し (はやし) in older Japanese already implies 'much earlier' or 'at a far earlier time'.",
  "etymology": "The adverb とっくに derives from the older form 疾うに (はやに).  疾う (はや) means 'early' or 'long ago,' while に functions as a time marker.  The modern form とっくに likely arose through a phonetic shift and intensification of the meaning, emphasizing the length of time elapsed.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「よ」 at the end is typical of casual male speech, adding a relaxed and slightly informal tone to the statement.  The sentence is straightforward, focusing on a simple past completion of the action."
