    "etymology": "The phrase 「に(も)なく」 is derived from 「に」 (a particle indicating location or state) and 「なく」 (the negative form of 「ある」, meaning \"to be\" or \"to exist\"). The 「も」 adds emphasis. Thus, literally, it suggests \"something that is not supposed to be happening in this state.\"",

It conveys a sense of surprise or unexpectedness. It often emphasizes the degree to which something deviates from the norm. You can think of it as meaning \"more than usual\" or \"contrary to one's usual self\".",
