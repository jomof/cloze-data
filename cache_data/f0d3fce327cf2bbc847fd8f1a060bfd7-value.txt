  "writeup": "を問わず is a grammatical pattern built upon the verb 問う (to inquire) and the auxiliary verb ず.  While literally translating to \"without questioning (A), (B)\", its practical usage conveys 'regardless of (A), (B)', 'whether (A) or not, (B)', or 'with or without (A), (B)'.  This structure typically follows nouns but can also appear after phrases like か or かどうか modifying adjectives. The particle を marks the aspect being disregarded.  In some cases, は may replace を, adding emphasis and slightly strengthening the overall meaning.  Although often compared to \"regardless,\" を問わず sometimes carries a nuance closer to \"in any case, for (A), (B)\", especially when (A) represents a scope. Comparing を問わず to に関わらず highlights this subtle distinction. This is a formal expression and less common in casual conversation.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's etymology stems directly from the verb 問う (toiu), meaning 'to ask' or 'to question,' and the auxiliary verb ず (zu), often indicating negation or absence. The combination implies a situation where the matter in question is not being inquired into or considered, thus conveying the meaning of 'regardless of.' The ず form is a classic example of how older grammatical structures persist in modern Japanese, retaining its formal tone.",
