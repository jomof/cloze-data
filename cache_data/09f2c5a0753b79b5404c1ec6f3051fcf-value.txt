  "writeup": "The grammar point \"べきではない\" (beki de wa nai) translates to \"should not,\" \"must not,\" or \"ought not to.\" It's an extension of the auxiliary verb \"べき\" (beki, 'ought to'), indicating the opposite.  This construction expresses a strong sense of impropriety or incorrectness; doing the action would be considered wrong.  It's paired with the plain (non-past) form of a verb.  While the particle \"は\" (wa) can be omitted, its presence strengthens the negation, making the overall phrase sound slightly stronger.  Interestingly,  \"する\" (suru, 'to do') paired with \"べき\" is an exception, allowing both \"するべき\" (surubeki) and \"すべき\" (subeki).",
