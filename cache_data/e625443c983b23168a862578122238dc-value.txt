  "writeup": "まま, derived from the kanji 儘 meaning 'as it is,' is a fascinating noun expressing the unchanged state of something.  Think of it as a way to describe something 'while remaining (A),' 'as (A) is,' or 'left in the state of (A).'  It follows any word in its attributive form.  While it *can* be used with verbs, it's most commonly paired with the past tense (た-form), often indicating something left alone or undisturbed, frequently seen with the negative ない-form.  Important Considerations: Although まま can be followed by the particle に, emphasizing the following verb, it's often omitted.  A fun side note:  The pronunciation まんま exists, but primarily in casual speech or informal writing. The nuance is subtle but important for native-like fluency.",
  "etymology": "The word まま comes directly from the Chinese character 儘, which carries the meaning of \"as it is\" or \"without change\". This perfectly encapsulates the grammatical function of ままに in modern Japanese.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the past tense of the verb 開ける (akeru, to open) with まま. The past tense is common with まま because it emphasizes the continued state. 「窓を開けたまま」 shows a state that continued after the action happened."

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This example uses the -te form of the verb かける (kakeru, to start [an engine]).  The polite form is used, showing respect for the listener.  「エンジンをかけたまま」 conveys that the engine is to be left in its running state."

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This uses the past tense form of the verb 飲む (nomu, to drink).  The sentence paints a picture of the speaker multitasking in a very casual manner.  「お茶を飲んだまま」 conveys the ongoing state of holding the tea while another action happens."
