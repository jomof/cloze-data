        "Usage": "Used in formal writing and speech to describe situations and conditions."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にあって」combines the particle 「に」, indicating location or circumstance, and the te-form of the verb 「ある」, meaning 'to be'. Together, they express the idea of 'being in' or 'existing under' a specific condition.",
    "writeup": "「にあって」is a formal Japanese grammar construction akin to its components. 「に」 indicates location, while 「あって」 is the te-form of the verb 「ある」 ('to be'). Therefore, 「にあって」 often translates to \"in the situation of (A)\" or \"under the conditions of (A).\" It follows a noun marking the condition; the subsequent clause highlights something remarkable about that situation. Occasionally, 「にあって」 is followed by 「も」, indicating that despite the noteworthy situation (A), (B) is unaffected as one might expect.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「にあって」 is formal, suitable for writing and formal speech.\n*   It emphasizes the **contrast** between a situation and an unexpected outcome.\n*   It sets the scene or background for an event. You are always \"in a state of...\" (something)",
