  "writeup": "This grammar point introduces four crucial phrases: **誰か (dareka)** meaning \"someone,\" **どこか (dokoka)** meaning \"somewhere,\" **誰も (daremo)** meaning \"no one,\" and **どこも (dokomo)** meaning \"nowhere.\"  These phrases function as adverbial particles, modifying the entire sentence.  Their meaning is heavily context-dependent, specifically whether the surrounding sentence is positive or negative.  In positive sentences, they express existence or possibility; in negative sentences, they indicate non-existence or impossibility. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* The particle \"か\" (ka) indicates an indefinite or unspecified entity.  It's used in questions or statements expressing uncertainty or openness.\n* The particle \"も\" (mo) indicates \"all\" or \"every.\"  In negative sentences, this implies a complete absence or negation.\n\nThe etymology of these words is straightforward.  They are combinations of interrogative words (誰 dare, どこ doko) and particles (か ka, も mo).  Understanding the nuances of か and も is key to mastering this grammar point. This construction isn't limited to just か and も; you can add other particles such as へ (e), に (ni), or と (to) to modify the meaning further.   In positive sentences, か always precedes any additional particles. In negative sentences, も always follows any additional particles. This difference reflects the grammatical function: か modifies the noun directly while も modifies the entire phrase.  While mostly used in negative contexts, も can appear in positive sentences, adding an emphatic 'all' or 'every' connotation.",
