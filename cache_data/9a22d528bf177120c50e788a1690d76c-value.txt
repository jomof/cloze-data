    "writeup": "「に加えて」 is a formal Japanese grammar pattern. It combines 「に」 with the て-form of the verb 「加える」 (kৱaeru), meaning \"to add\" or \"to append.\"  It generally translates to \"in addition to (A), (B)\" or \"not only (A), but also (B).\" Because it's a formal expression, 「に加えて」 can also appear in its formal conjunctive form, 「に加え」. To use 「に加えて」, place it immediately after the noun you want to highlight as the base information, then introduce what's being added in the following clause.\n\nBoth the kanji (に加えて) and hiragana (にくわえて) forms are common, so it's good to recognize both.\n\n**Important Consideration:** 「に加えて」 is often used when (B) enhances or magnifies what is already true about (A).  This means it frequently highlights something brought about by (B) that wouldn't be possible with just (A) alone. This increase can be either positive or negative.",
