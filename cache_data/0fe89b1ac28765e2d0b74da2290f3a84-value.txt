    "etymology": "「こと」 originally means 'thing' or 'matter.'  When used to nominalize verbs, it retains this sense, referring to the 'thing' or 'matter' of doing the verb.",
    "writeup": "「こと」 is used to nominalize verbs, effectively turning them into nouns. This allows you to use verbs as subjects, objects, or other noun-like elements within a sentence.  Think of it as creating a phrase that means \"the act of [verb]\" or \"the thing that is [verb].\"\n\nUnlike 「の」, which also nominalizes, 「こと」 often refers to more abstract concepts, general activities, or facts, while 「の」 can sometimes imply a specific instance or a more concrete action.\n\nYou can also insert adjectives or adverbs to modify the verb before 「こと」, like 「お金を使い過ぎないこと」 (the act of not overspending money).",
