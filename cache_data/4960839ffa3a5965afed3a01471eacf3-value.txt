    "etymology": "The kanji 更 (さら) means \"to change\" or \"to become new\".  The adverb 更に (さらに) builds on this, implying a change that goes even further or happens again.",
    "writeup": "**更に (さらに)** is an adverb that means \"even more\", \"further\", or \"again\". It indicates that something is increasing in degree, quantity, or frequency.  It often suggests that a certain level or state has already been reached, and what follows goes beyond that. You can think of it as adding another layer or pushing something beyond its current state.  It can be used for both positive and negative situations.  It frequently appears at the beginning of the latter part of a sentence, after some initial information has been established.",
