    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずにはすまない」 is composed of several elements. 「ず」 is the negative form of a verb in classical Japanese, functioning similarly to 「ない」. 「に」 is a case-marking particle. 「は」 is an adverbial particle emphasizing the negative condition. 「すまない」 is the negative form of the verb 「済む(すむ)」, meaning \"to end,\" \"to be resolved,\" or \"to get by.\" Therefore, the literal breakdown suggests that something cannot be resolved or get by without a certain action.",
    "writeup": "「ずにはすまない」 indicates a situation where one **has no choice but to do something**, or **cannot avoid doing something**.  Think of it as an obligation or inevitability.  It carries a formal nuance.  The literal sense is closer to \"it will not do\" or \"it won't be settled\" unless a particular action is taken.\n\nYou'll notice the 「ず」. This is the classical negative auxiliary verb, similar to modern 「ない」. It directly attaches to the verb stem. When used with 「する」, it becomes 「ぜず」.\n\nThe construction 「…ないではすまない」 has the same meaning. Be aware that while this grammar point implies necessity, it's generally used when the obligation is clear to everyone, not just a personal feeling.  Using it for simple personal desires can sound unnatural.",
