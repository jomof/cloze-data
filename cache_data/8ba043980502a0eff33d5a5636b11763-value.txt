    "etymology": "The term 「い-Adjective」 comes from the fact that these adjectives always end with the hiragana い in their dictionary form. This 'i' is an integral part of the adjective, unlike the 'na' in 「な-Adjectives」 which is a grammatical particle.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, 「い-Adjectives」, also known as *keiyoushi*, are a class of adjectives that always end in 「い」 in their dictionary form. They directly modify nouns and can function as predicates. Unlike 「な-Adjectives」, 「い-Adjectives」 cannot be followed by 「だ」 in their plain form. Instead, 「です」 is used to make them polite, although this is technically incorrect but widely accepted. \n\nIt's crucial to distinguish true 「い-Adjectives」 from other words ending in 「い」. For example, 「きれい」 (pretty) appears to be an 「い-Adjective」, but it originates from the kanji 綺麗, where 「い」 is part of the kanji itself. There's no strict rule to differentiate them, but with practice, you'll quickly learn to recognize the common exceptions.",
