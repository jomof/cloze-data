    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[て] + **もいい**」 expresses permission, allowance, or concession. It conveys that something is \"okay even if\" a certain condition is met or asks for permission to do something.\n\n*   **Permission:** It asks for or grants permission to do something. For example, 「ここで食べてもいいですか」 (\"May I eat here?\").\n*   **Concession:** It indicates that something is acceptable even if a certain condition exists. For example, 「高くてもいい」 (\"It's okay even if it's expensive\").\n\nThis grammar point can also be used with nouns, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives to express that something is acceptable even if certain qualities or conditions are met. For い-adjectives, the い is dropped and replaced with 「くて」. For な-adjectives, 「でも」 is added after the adjective. For nouns, 「でも」 is also added after the noun.\n\nIt is essential to understand the context to interpret the meaning accurately. It can also be used as the negative 「てはいけない」, which is useful for describing things that one 「must not do」.",
    "etymology": "「て」 is the te-form conjugation of a verb, indicating a connection or sequence. 「も」 means \"even,\" implying \"even if\" the preceding action or state is true. 「いい」 means \"good\" or \"okay,\" indicating permission or acceptance. Therefore, 「てもいい」 literally translates to \"even if [verb in te-form], it is okay.\"",
