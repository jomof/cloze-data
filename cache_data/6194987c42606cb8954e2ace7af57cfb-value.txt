    "etymology": "全然 (ぜんぜん) is formed from the kanji 全 (zen), meaning \"all\" or \"whole,\" repeated for emphasis. It implies a complete or total negation when used with negative verbs, or a complete affirmation in its newer, slang usage.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 全然 (ぜんぜん) is traditionally used with negative expressions. When placed before a phrase containing ない or ません, it means \"completely not (A)\" or \"not (A) at all.\" In writing, both 全然 (kanji) and ぜんぜん (hiragana) are acceptable. In casual conversation, ぜんぜん is more flexible and friendly compared to 全く (まったく), which carries a more formal and often negative nuance. While both convey \"not (A) at all,\" 全く can sometimes imply displeasure, depending on tone.  It's **important** to note that 全然 is increasingly used with positive expressions, especially by younger speakers, to mean \"totally (A)\" or \"completely (A).\" Although grammatically unconventional, this usage is becoming widely accepted.",
