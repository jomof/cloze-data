  "writeup": "The phrase \"結果・の結果\" (kekka/no kekka) translates to \"as a result of.\"  It's a common structure in Japanese used to express causality.  The noun \"結果\" (kekka) meaning 'result' is followed by の (no), a possessive particle, to connect it to the preceding cause. This construction is versatile and can describe both positive and negative outcomes, unlike some similar expressions that focus solely on negative consequences.  Understanding this nuance is key to using it correctly in various contexts.  This grammar point is suitable for most registers, from casual conversation to formal writing. The construction is equally usable by both genders and across age groups.",
  "etymology": "The word 結果 (kekka) itself is a compound word. 結 (ketsu) means 'to tie up' or 'to conclude', and 果 (ka) means 'fruit' or 'result'.  Therefore, 結果 literally means 'the tied-up fruit', or the 'final result' of a process. This etymology hints at the idea of a culmination or conclusion resulting from prior actions.",
