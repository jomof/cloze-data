  "writeup": "ずつ, or 宛 in its kanji form, is a suffix in Japanese used to emphasize things occurring or existing in specific quantities. It's often translated as 'each', 'per', or 'at a time'.  Depending on the source, ずつ may also be considered an adverbial particle; however, this doesn't affect its usage.  It follows the number or amount it modifies.  For example, \"10ずつ\" means \"10 at a time.\"  The kanji, 宛, literally means 'allotment' and refers to distinct groupings. It's frequently used for addresses (address considered one's 'allotment'), where it has the reading 宛. For ずつ, 'allotment' is also accurate in most contexts.  This suffix is versatile and adds a nuance of precise measurement or distribution to a sentence. Mastering ずつ enhances your ability to express specific quantities and actions clearly and naturally.",
  "etymology": "The kanji 宛 (ate), when used in the reading ずつ,  shifts its meaning from 'address' or 'allotment' to represent a measured distribution or occurrence.  The evolution from 'designated place' to 'measured quantity' hints at a semantic shift driven by practical use.",
