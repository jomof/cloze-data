    "etymology": "The grammar point 「まくる」 comes from the verb 「捲る (めくる)」, meaning \"to roll up,\" \"to flip over,\" or \"to wind.\" The nuance is that the action is performed rapidly and repeatedly, as if turning pages one after another or rolling something up quickly. It implies doing something with great intensity and without restraint.",
    "writeup": "「まくる」 is a verb that attaches to the ます-stem (連用形) of other verbs to indicate that the action is being done repeatedly, intensely, or recklessly. The base verb 「捲る (めくる)」 means \"to roll up\" or \"to turn over,\" suggesting an action performed over and over, like turning pages. Common translations include \"to do (A) like crazy,\" \"to do nothing but (A),\" and \"to constantly do (A).\" It often carries the nuance that the action is done without thinking about the consequences.  The verb must be volitional, meaning the speaker has control over it. It can be used in both positive and negative contexts.",
