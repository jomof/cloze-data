  "writeup": "さぞ is a fairly formal adverb in Japanese used emphatically to highlight the speaker's understanding of the listener's situation or feelings.  Common translations include 'you must be very (A)', 'how (A) you must be', or 'I dare say that (A)'.  'I dare to say that (A)' is closest to the literal meaning, as the speaker empathizes by imagining the situation from the other person's perspective. As さぞ is an adverb, it usually appears at the sentence's beginning, modifying the entire phrase that follows. The phrase often ends with だろう or でしょう, indicating the speaker's opinion is limited by their own knowledge.  Caution: さぞ comes from the kanji 嘸, with alternative readings 嘸や and 嘸かし, sometimes used as even stronger versions of さぞ.  While nearly identical in meaning, さぞかし is used more frequently than さぞや.",
  "etymology": "The adverb さぞ originates from the kanji 嘸 (mu), meaning 'certainly' or 'undoubtedly'.  The modern usage reflects this sense of strong certainty and empathetic speculation about the listener's experience.",
