  "writeup": "かたがた is a conjunction primarily seen in hiragana, translated as “in addition to doing (A), (B),” “along with (A), (B),” or “incidentally to (A), (B).”  Both (A) and (B) usually hold equal importance, but (B) suggests a secondary, incidental action performed while doing (A).  かたがた attaches to the end of a noun representing (A), while (B) often (but not always) involves a verb of action. If (A) is a noun usually taking する, the する is omitted.  \n\n**Important Considerations:** かたがた is a formal structure predominantly found in writing, often used in apologies or expressions of gratitude.  Its use outside such contexts may sound unnatural.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "婚約の報告**かたがた**、お父様とお母様に会いに行きます。",
      "english": "I will go see my fiancé's father and mother, partly to report our engagement.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses polite language 「お父様とお母様」 and the formal structure of かたがた, appropriate for a formal announcement to elders.  The speaker is likely younger. The overall tone is respectful and informative."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "お礼**かたがた**、近況報告も兼ねてお伺いいたします。",
      "english": "I will visit, partly to express my gratitude and also to catch up.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "nuance": "The sentence blends formality with a touch of informality in  「近況報告も兼ねて」, making it suitable for a slightly less formal setting.  The speaker is likely expressing their intentions to visit someone slightly younger or a peer."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "お土産**かたがた**、少しばかりですが、差し上げます。",
      "english": "Along with this souvenir, I'm giving you this small gift.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "nuance": "The formality of 「かたがた」 and the humble phrasing of  「少しばかりですが」 show respect and politeness. This might be a speaker of any age and gender offering a gift to a slightly younger or same age listener."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "お詫び**かたがた**、今後は気をつけます。",
      "english": "I will be more careful in the future, also to apologize.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "nuance": "The use of  「お詫びかたがた」 is perfectly suited for a formal apology. The speaker sounds older and more experienced, expressing remorse with an intent to improve. The listener could be of any age and gender."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この機会**かたがた**、あなたに私の気持ち、伝えさせてください。",
      "english": "I'll take this opportunity to tell you how I feel, incidentally.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "While 「かたがた」 maintains a degree of formality, the context is distinctly romantic. The male speaker uses this opportunity to express deeper feelings, adding a nuance of indirectness to his declaration. 「あなたに私の気持ち、伝えさせてください」 is a way for the speaker to express his feelings romantically while maintaining some distance, making it effective in this particular situation."
    }
  ],
  "etymology": "The etymology of かたがた is complex and rooted in older forms of Japanese. While a precise etymological path is difficult to definitively trace, the current usage suggests a combination of elements implying 'along with' and 'incidentally,' reflecting a simultaneous yet slightly secondary action.  Its formal register likely reflects its origins in more formal literary styles of the past."
