  "writeup": "The Japanese grammar point \"ものだ\" (monoda) expresses a sense of expectation, obligation, or inherent nature.  It's often translated as \"supposed to,\" \"should,\" or \"that's the way it is.\"  The word \"もの\" (mono), meaning \"thing,\" acts as a dummy noun, grammaticalizing the preceding phrase.  The particle \"だ\" (da) is the copula, indicating a state of being.  This construction subtly suggests that the described state is a natural or expected consequence of the circumstances, rather than a strict rule.  The negative form, \"ものではない\" (monodewa nai), conveys the opposite: something unexpected or contrary to expectations. A more casual negative form is \"もんじゃない\" (monjanai). This is common in spoken language and is grammatically correct.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "子供は素直**なものだ**。",
      "english": "Children are supposed to be obedient.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "plain form",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the plain form of ものだ, making it suitable for a general informative statement.  The choice of 「子供」 (kodomo) as the subject subtly suggests a slight element of tolerance, acknowledging that children aren't always obedient."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "約束は守る**ものだ**。",
      "english": "Promises are supposed to be kept.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "instructive",
      "conjugation": "plain form",
      "nuance": "The use of 「約束」 (yakusoku) and 「守る」 (mamoru), both quite formal, lends a sense of seriousness and formality to the statement, making it appropriate for an instructive or even moralizing context.  The plain form of 「ものだ」 (monoda) maintains a standard, rather than overly strong, tone."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "恋人は優しくする**ものだ**よ。",
      "english": "Lovers should be kind to each other, you know?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "plain form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The addition of 「よ」 (yo) softens the statement, making it appropriate for a casual, friendly setting, particularly between romantic partners.  The use of 「恋人」 (koibito) as a subject adds to this romance.  A female speaker using 「よ」 (yo) is common, giving the sentence a gentle, almost coaxing tone."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "もっと努力する**ものじゃないか**？",
      "english": "Shouldn't you work harder?",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "persuasive",
      "conjugation": "casual negative form",
      "nuance": "The negative form 「ものじゃないか」 (monjanai ka) is used to make a suggestion, rather than a direct command. The addition of か (ka) turns it into a question, making the statement softer and more persuasive than a direct negative statement would be."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "そんなことはする**ものではない**。",
      "english": "That's not something you should do.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "commanding",
      "conjugation": "negative form",
      "nuance": "The formal negative form 「ものではない」 (monodewa nai) is a more direct and serious way of expressing disapproval.  The use of 「そんなこと」 (sonna koto) adds emphasis."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "今日はゆっくり休む**ものだ**。疲れたからね。",
      "english": "You should relax today. You're tired, after all.",

      "setting": "supportive",
      "conjugation": "plain form",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The casual tone is set by the use of 「ね」 (ne) and the casual form of 「ものだ」 (monoda). The speaker's age contributes to a softer, supportive tone, almost like a parental figure giving advice."
    },
        {
      "japanese": "あのね、あなたといると、幸せな**ものだ**って感じるの。",
      "english": "You know, when I'm with you, I feel like this is what happiness is.",

      "setting": "intimate",
      "conjugation": "plain form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The intimate register is created by the use of 「あのね」 (ano ne) and the plain form of 「ものだ」 (monoda). The female speaker using 「の」 (no) at the end is a characteristically feminine way to end a sentence. This adds a soft and intimate feel to a confession of feelings."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the nuance of \"ものだ\" changes slightly depending on the context and the form used (plain, negative, casual negative).  The key is understanding that it expresses an inherent quality or expected behavior rather than a strict rule or command.  Practice helps you hone this sensitivity.",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The subtle differences between these expressions lie in the strength of obligation and the underlying reason for the statement.  ものだ focuses on the inherent nature or typical state, while others emphasize moral obligation, logical expectation, or causal explanation. Pay close attention to the context to choose the most appropriate expression."
