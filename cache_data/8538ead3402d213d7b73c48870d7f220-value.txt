  "writeup": "The grammar point \"を機に\" (wo ki ni) translates to \"on the occasion of\" or \"taking the opportunity of.\"  It's a nuanced expression, subtly conveying the speaker's active utilization of a specific event or circumstance as a catalyst for action.  The structure combines the particle を (wo), marking the direct object, with 機 (ki, 'opportunity'), and the particle に (ni), indicating a point in time or reason.  Therefore, it suggests that the event isn't just a backdrop; it's a lever for the subsequent action.  Think of it as 'using (A) as a springboard for (B).' While sometimes translated as 'on the occasion of,' the inherent dynamism is crucial. This point is often used when the second action is a direct result or consequence of the first event.",
  "etymology": "The word 機 (ki) originates from the Chinese character 機, which originally referred to a machine or mechanism.  Its evolution to encompass 'opportunity' reflects the understanding of opportunities as the mechanisms or catalysts that enable change or action.",
