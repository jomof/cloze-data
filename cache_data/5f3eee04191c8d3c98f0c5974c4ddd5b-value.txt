    "etymology": "The grammar point 「をもとに」 literally translates to \"with (something) as the origin\". It is formed from the direct object marker 「を」, the noun 「元(もと)」 meaning \"origin\", \"source\", or \"base\", and the particle 「に」.",
    "writeup": "「をもとに」 is a grammatical structure used to indicate that something is created, judged, or based on a particular source or origin. It combines the direct object marker 「を」, the noun 「元(もと)」 (origin), and the particle 「に」.  Think of it as saying something is made \"with [noun] as its base.\" While often written in hiragana (をもとに), it can also appear as を元に.  This pattern frequently appears with verbs like 書(か)く (to write), 作(つく)る (to make), and できる (to be able to be made/created).",
