        "Verb (て-form) + やる": "Expresses doing something for someone of lower status or showing someone what you can do."

    "etymology": "The verb 「やる」 originally meant \"to do.\" Over time, it acquired the nuance of giving or doing something for someone considered lower in status, such as pets, children, or subordinates. It can also carry a nuance of demonstrating one's ability or resolve.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「やる」, written as 遣る in kanji, primarily means \"to do,\" but can also mean \"to give\" as a casual form of 「あげる」. When attached to the て-form of verbs as a subsidiary verb, it indicates that the speaker is doing something for someone of lower status, or demonstrating a strong resolve to do something.\n\n*   **Doing for someone:** When substituting for 「あげる」, it often sounds patronizing, as if the speaker is doing an action because it is unavoidable, and the person they are doing it for cannot do it themselves. This will be translated as \"to do for\".\n*   **Showing resolve:** In other cases, 「やる」 acts more like 「見せる」 \"to show\", and indicates the speaker's strong will to perform an action. In these cases, it will be translated as \"I will do (A), just wait and see\", or \"I’ll definitely do (A)\".\n\nIn either case, the underlying meaning is just \"to do,\" with emphasis on the doer being in a position of power or superiority.",
