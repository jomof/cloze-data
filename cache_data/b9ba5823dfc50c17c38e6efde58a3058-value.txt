    "etymology": "あれ originates as a distal demonstrative, indicating something distant from both the speaker and listener. It's part of a set with これ (this) and それ (that).",
    "writeup": "あれ, just like これ and それ, is one of several pronoun-like words in Japanese that stand in for nouns. あれ translates roughly to \"that\" in English, or more specifically, \"that over there.\" Unlike それ, あれ is used to indicate things that are distant from both the speaker and the listener. Therefore, it's often translated as \"that over there\".\n\n**Important:** Be careful not to confuse あれ with the common spoken expression 「あれ？」, which means \"huh?\" or \"oh?\". These are not the same words. The difference is usually clear from context and intonation. 「あれ？」 as \"huh?\" has a rising tone, like a question.",
