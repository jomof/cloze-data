  "writeup": "The Japanese past continuous tense, expressed as ていた (plain) or ていました (polite), indicates an action or state that was in progress at a specific time in the past.  It's formed by combining the て-form of a verb with the past tense of the verb いる (iru, to be/exist).  Think of it as the equivalent of 'was doing' or 'was being' in English.  The nuance can range from a simple description of a past action to an implication of a continued or incomplete state. For instance,  \"本を読んでいた\" (Hon o yon de ita - I was reading a book) might mean that reading was in progress for a certain time, but doesn't necessarily imply that the reading is finished.",
  "etymology": "ていた is formed from the connective particle て (te) and the past tense of the verb いる (iru, to be/exist), which is いた (ita). The て-form connects the preceding verb to いる, indicating the continuous aspect.  The past tense いた then shifts the entire phrase to the past continuous.",

      "conjugation": "plain past continuous"

      "japanese": "ずっと彼を**待っていた**。",
      "english": "I was waiting for him for a long time.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "melancholic",
      "conjugation": "plain past continuous"
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼はずっと私を**見ていた**よ。何かあった？",
      "english": "He was looking at me the whole time. Was something wrong?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "interrogative",
      "conjugation": "plain past continuous",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of \"よ\" (yo) at the end of 「彼はずっと私を**見ていた**よ」 is a common colloquialism, softening the tone and making it sound more natural in casual conversation between female and male speakers. This is also appropriate for a younger speaker talking to an older male listener."

    {
      "japanese": "彼女は、ずっと私を**見ていた**んです。",
      "english": "She was looking at me the whole time.",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "polite past continuous",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「んです」 (ndesu) adds politeness and softens the potential intensity of a statement.  The speaker, a man, is using a polite register with a hint of implication of 「ずっと私を**見ていた**んです」 (she was looking at me the whole time). This is suitable for a flirty context."

      "japanese": "あの時、私はあなたを**愛していた**のです。",

      "setting": "intimate",
      "conjugation": "polite past continuous",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of  「のです」 (nodesu) with the past continuous conjugation 「愛していた」 (aishiteita - I was loving you) creates a more formal, perhaps even slightly melancholic or regretful tone. This is appropriate for an older male speaker reflecting on a past romantic relationship with a younger female listener. The use of 「愛していた」 (aishiteita), rather than simply 「愛していた」 (aishiteita - I loved you), subtly underscores the continuous nature of the feeling at the time."

    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Note that the context is crucial. The same ていた construction can describe a completed action (like watching a whole movie) or an ongoing action interrupted (like reading emails during a meeting).  Pay close attention to the surrounding sentences to understand the precise nuance.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "Verb + て",
      "nuance": "Unlike ていた, which expresses past continuous action, Verb + て simply links actions or describes consecutive events.  It doesn't inherently imply duration or ongoing state."
    },
    {
      "term": "う-Verb (Past)",
      "nuance": "While both relate to the past, う-verb past tense describes a completed action in the past, unlike ていた's emphasis on the duration of an ongoing action."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that て (te) acts as a connective particle when used by itself, while ていた (teita) adds a layer of duration and incompleteness to the past action.  The う-verb past tense simply indicates a completed past action; there's no inherent notion of ongoing or unfinished business."
