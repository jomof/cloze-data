    "etymology": "でしょう is a polite form derived from the copula です. It adds a nuance of uncertainty or seeking confirmation.",
    "writeup": "でしょう is a conjugated form of です, and can also be seen in the contracted form でしょ (more casual). でしょう is regularly translated to \"right?\" or \"probably\" in English. In a broader sense it just expresses an assertion about something (like です), that the speaker assumes the listener would probably agree with.\n\nIn the examples, the speaker seeks confirmation or affirms that the listener agrees with them.\n\nAs でしょう is a conjugation of です (the polite form of だ), it usually follows the plain form of words, rather than words using 〜ます. However, in very formal situations, or older literature 〜ます でしょう may be seen.\n\n**Important**: Despite sounding relatively low confidence, using でしょう implies that the speaker has some form of information that makes them believe that the statement is true.",
