    "etymology": "「無さ」(nasa) is a noun derived from the adjective 「無い」(nai - 'not exist' or 'not have'). It directly expresses the state of lacking something. The particle 「の」(no) connects a noun to 「無さ」, indicating that the noun is what is being lacked.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「の無さ・のなさ」 expresses the **lack or absence** of something. It is formed by attaching 「の無さ」 or 「のなさ」 to a noun. Both 「の無さ」 and 「のなさ」 are valid readings and generally interchangeable, though 「のなさ」 might sound slightly softer or more colloquial to some speakers. \n\nThis construction is versatile and can be used in a variety of contexts to describe a deficiency or absence of a quality, characteristic, or entity.",
