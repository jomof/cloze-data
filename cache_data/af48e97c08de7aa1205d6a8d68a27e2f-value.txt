    "etymology": "としては is formed from として (as), the te-form of する (to do), and は (the topic marker). Literally, it could be interpreted as 「～として、～は」, setting up a specific role or perspective and then marking it as the topic for further discussion or comparison.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「としては」 expands on the meaning of 「として」 ('as'). It emphasizes the subject (A) as a separate entity that is about to be compared with something or from whose standpoint the speaker is making an assumption. It can be translated as \"as (A)\" or \"for an (A)\".\n\nWhen the noun connected to 「としては」 is a person or organization, the speaker is often making a judgment from that standpoint. When it's not a person or organization, the translation is often \"as for,\", highlighting the broad topic before the speaker offers their thoughts.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「としては」 is used to make broad judgments considering all aspects of (A) and what would usually be expected of (A), unlike 「にしては」, which is more for giving personal opinions.",
