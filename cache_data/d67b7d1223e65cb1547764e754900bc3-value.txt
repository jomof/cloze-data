  "writeup": "てはいられない is a grammar pattern combining the conjunctive particle て, は, and the negative potential form of the verb いる 'to be'.  Common translations include 'can't afford to' and 'unable to'. The literal meaning, 'to not be able to be with (A)', reflects the impossibility of the action. This structure primarily uses verbs but may occasionally appear with い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns.  The verb connected to てはいられない often describes an action that cannot continue due to time constraints or feelings.  It frequently implies '(A) cannot continue due to (B)', with (B) explained elsewhere in the sentence.  With い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns, the nuance shifts, simply conveying the meaning of いられない—that (A) 'cannot be' or is 'impossible'.  Remember, ては becomes では with nouns and な-adjectives.",
