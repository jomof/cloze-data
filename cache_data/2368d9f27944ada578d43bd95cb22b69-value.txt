  "writeup": "The expression と考えられる is used to express an objective opinion in Japanese.  It combines と (to) and the passive-indicating auxiliary verb られる (rareru). Common translations include 'can be considered as (A)', 'is thought to be (A)', or 'it is conceivable that (A)'. Because it begins with と, this structure often appears at the end of phrases, effectively framing them as a quoted opinion.  To express a subjective opinion, one would use と思われる (to omowareru) instead. The key difference lies in the basis of the opinion: objective opinions rely primarily on observable facts, while subjective opinions are based on emotions, feelings, or preferences.  Compared to と考えられている (to kangae rarete iru), と考えられる (to kangae rareru) emphasizes judgment, whereas the former highlights widely accepted views.  Mastering this distinction is crucial for nuanced communication.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "あの事故は煽り運転のせいだと考えられる。",
      "english": "That accident can be considered to be caused by aggressive driving.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a fairly neutral register, appropriate for a general discussion of an accident.  The use of 「あの事故」 (ano jiko) indicates a degree of distance from the speaker's emotional involvement in the event. The objective nature of the sentence is clear in the use of 「と考えられる」(to kangae rareru)."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "日本語は難しいと考えられる。",
      "english": "Japanese can be considered difficult.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "This is a simple and direct statement of opinion. 「日本語は」 (Nihongo wa) is a neutral phrasing, appropriate for casual settings.  The use of 「と考えられる」 (to kangae rareru) keeps the tone objective, but remains easily adaptable to different settings. The sentence is concise and to the point."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の成功は、彼の努力によると考えられます。",
      "english": "His success can be considered due to his efforts.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "polite form",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「と考えられます」(to kangae raremasu) makes this a suitable sentence for a formal setting. The phrasing 「彼の成功は」 (kare no seiko wa) is standard and lacks any particular gender or age connotation. The use of polite speech elevates the tone, appropriate for formal communication."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この計画は、成功する可能性が高いと考えられます。",
      "english": "This plan is thought to have a high probability of success.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": "polite form",
      "nuance": "Again, 「と考えられます」(to kangae raremasu) indicates a formal register, while 「この計画は」(kono keikaku wa) is neutral in its phrasing.  The formality enhances the professional tone needed for business discussion."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "君の笑顔は、僕を幸せにする魔法だと考えられるよ。",
      "english": "Your smile, I think, is magic that makes me happy.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「君」(kimi) and 「僕」(boku) establishes a relatively intimate relationship between the speaker and listener, appropriate for a flirty setting.  The somewhat exaggerated statement 「幸せにする魔法」(shiawase ni suru mahou) adds to the romantic tone, showing that the speaker is charmed.  The addition of 「よ」(yo) softens the statement, making it friendlier and less blunt."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたといると、時間が早く過ぎるのが不思議だと考えられるわ。",
      "english": "I find it amazing that when I'm with you, time seems to pass by quickly.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「あなた」(anata) and 「わ」(wa) makes the sentence sound appropriate for an early romantic context. The sentence conveys subtle infatuation and admiration without being overly explicit. 「不思議だ」(fushigi da) hints at the mysterious and intriguing feeling that the speaker associates with the listener."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember, the choice between と考えられる and と思われる hinges on the objectivity versus subjectivity of your opinion.  Use と考えられる for opinions grounded in facts; use と思われる for those based on feelings or interpretations.  The context will help dictate the appropriateness of the politeness level.",

    {
      "term": "とかんがえられている",
      "meaning": "Is considered, Is thought of as",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike と考えられる, とかんがえられている implies a more widely accepted or established opinion, often based on consensus rather than individual judgment."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both と考えられる and とかんがえられている convey the idea of 'being considered,' the latter suggests a more established and generally accepted viewpoint.  To avoid confusion, consider the source and strength of the opinion. If the opinion is based on individual assessment, use と考えられる; for a broadly held belief, use とかんがえられている."
