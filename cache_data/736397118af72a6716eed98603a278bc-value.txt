  "writeup": "The expression なくては (nakute wa) and its more formal variant なくしては (nakushite wa)  convey the meaning of \"without\" or \"if not for.\"  It emphasizes the absolute necessity of a preceding condition for a particular outcome.  This grammatical construction isn't just a simple negation; it carries a strong implication of impossibility.  The sentence structure generally follows a pattern: 'If not for [A], then not [B],' implying [A] is an essential prerequisite for [B].  It's often used with nouns or nominalized phrases (using こと).  The formal variant, なくしては, carries a more rigid and less flexible tone compared to なくては.  While both forms achieve the same meaning, the context should inform your choice.  The nuances can be subtle, but careful choice of form conveys the level of formality and directness.",
  "etymology": "The structure combines the negative conjunctive form of the adjective ない (nai, not), なく (naku), with the particle して (shite), indicating a conditional relationship, and finally は (wa), functioning as an adverbial particle that adds emphasis to the preceding phrase. The combination expresses a hypothetical dependency.",

      "setting": "Supportive",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「乗り越えられなかっただろう」(norikoerarenakattadarou), a past-tense conditional, further emphasizing the hypothetical dependency on the speaker's support.  The formality of the sentence is appropriate for expressing genuine support, even in a serious circumstance."

      "english": "Without his dedication, the project wouldn't have succeeded.",
      "register": "Semi-formal",
      "setting": "Reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「献身」(kenshin, dedication) elevates the tone.  The past conditional 「成功しなかっただろう」(seikoushinakatta darou) maintains a somewhat formal yet reflective tone about the past outcome."

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「君」(kimi) and 「僕」(boku) are casual terms of address, indicative of a close relationship. The sentence expresses a strong emotional dependency in a playful and endearing manner, which is characteristic of romantic advances."

    {
      "japanese": "あなたと出会わなければ、私は今の幸せを味わえなかったでしょう。",
