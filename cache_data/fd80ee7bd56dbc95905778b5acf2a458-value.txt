    "writeup": "The suffix 「分」 indicates an amount or portion of something. It is typically attached to a number and counter, or a noun. When used with a number and counter, 「分」 signifies something worth or equivalent to that amount. For instance, 「五人分の食料」 (gonin bun no shokuryou) means \"food for five people.\" When attached directly to a noun, it indicates the amount or portion represented by that noun, such as 「減少分」 (genshou bun), meaning \"the amount by which something decreased.\"",
    "etymology": "「分」 originally means 'to divide' or 'to share'. This meaning extends to indicate a portion or share of something, which is the basis for its use as a suffix indicating amounts.",
