  "writeup": "ときたら is a casual expression used to convey mild frustration or exasperation towards something or someone (A) in a lighthearted manner.  It's a combination of the particle と and the verb 来る (kuru, 'to come'), conjugated to the conditional form たら ('if').  It's often translated as 'that blasted (A)', 'that darn (A)', or simply 'speaking of (A)'.  It directly follows nouns.  This grammar point almost exclusively appears in kana, so remembering the verb stem helps with understanding its meaning.  Interestingly, while often expressing negativity, ときたら can also highlight something about (A) that is 'to be expected' or 'only natural'. The context of the following clause usually clarifies the intended nuance.  Even with its dual nature, it's helpful to consider ときたら as simply 'when it comes to (A),' with the subsequent phrase (B) indicating the positive or negative sentiment.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of ときたら lies in its composition.  It's a combination of と (to), a particle marking a topic or quoted speech, and the conditional form たら (tara) of the verb 来る (kuru), meaning 'to come'.  Therefore, a literal interpretation would be something like 'when it comes to...'  The nuance of frustration is derived from its frequent use in informal contexts to express displeasure about a particular topic.",
