  "writeup": "まじき is the attributive form of まじ, a classical auxiliary verb that has been replaced almost entirely by まい 'must not', 'should not' in modern Japanese. まじ itself has this same meaning of 'must not', and will only be seen in a very limited number of formal expressions. Although slightly different in nuance, まじき is often translated simply as 'not proper for (A)', or 'unbecoming of (A)' in each case. The most common pattern that まじき will be seen in is (A)にあるまじき(B), where the case-marking particle に follows a noun, then is linked to the う-verb ある, before まじき will connect to a second noun. Occasionally, に will be replaced by として 'as', with the rest of the structure remaining the same. 許すまじき 'must not be forgiven', or simply 'unforgivable' is another pattern that may be seen.  This grammar point is extremely formal and rarely used in modern, everyday conversation. It carries a strong sense of disapproval and is suitable only for very serious or formal contexts.",
