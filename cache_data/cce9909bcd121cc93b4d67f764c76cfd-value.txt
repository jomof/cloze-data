  "writeup": "ようにする is a common Japanese expression used to convey the intention to make an effort to do something. It combines よう (the adverbial form of ようだ, meaning 'seem,' 'appear') with する (to do).  This structure emphasizes the speaker's conscious effort to achieve a specific outcome.  The action described (always a verb) is something the speaker is actively trying to accomplish, implying a degree of intentionality and effort. This structure can also be used negatively, meaning \"to make sure not to do (A)\".  The nuance stems from ようだ originating from the kanji 様 (samā), meaning 'manner,' implying that the speaker is undertaking the action in a manner specifically designed for success.  It's more than just 'to do'; it's 'to do in a way that ensures it gets done.'",
  "etymology": "The core of this grammar point lies in the combination of よう (yōu), derived from ようだ (yō da) meaning 'seems like', 'appears to be', and する (suru) meaning 'to do'.  ようだ itself originates from the word 様 (samā), meaning 'appearance' or 'manner', giving よう its nuance of intentional action towards a desired outcome.",

      "japanese": "宿題を忘れないようにした。",
      "english": "I made sure not to forget my homework.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": "Plain past",

      "conjugation": "Plain past",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「こっそり」 adds a playful, secretive element to the sentence, appropriate for a flirty context.  The sentence's structure and casual register suggest that this is a female speaking to a male, perhaps one she is attracted to. The use of  「した」 is a simple past tense which makes it more casual and intimate."

      "japanese": "会議に遅れないように、タクシーに乗ろうとしたけど、間に合わなかった。",
      "english": "I tried to take a taxi to avoid being late for the meeting, but I didn't make it.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": "Plain past",
      "nuance": "The casual past tense 「した」 and 「なかった」 are used in a self-deprecating way, appropriate for apologizing for being late.  The tense in 「間に合わなかった」 is vital to the meaning here; it's not just that there was an effort made, but that it failed."

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the emphasis.  ようにする stresses the effort and intention behind an action, aiming for a specific result. Other expressions, like  〜ようとしない or ことにする, may convey similar ideas but focus on different aspects—the lack of effort, the decision-making process, or simply the desire for a certain outcome.  Careful consideration of context and the nuance you wish to convey is crucial when choosing the most appropriate expression."
