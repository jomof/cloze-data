  "writeup": "ともなく and ともなしに are grammatical structures used to describe an action (A) performed absentmindedly, leading to an unexpected event (B).  Think of it as \"unconsciously doing A, then B happened.\"  This pattern combines the case-marking particle と, the adverbial particle も, and the conjunctive form of the い-adjective ない. It typically follows the dictionary form of verbs.  Literally, it implies something like 'even while not intending to (B), while (A), (B)'. ともなしに is similar, substituting the noun なし ('without') with に instead of using the conjunctive form of ない.  You'll frequently see ともなく and ともなしに used with たら, emphasizing the specific timing of the unexpected event (B) while performing the initial action (A) absentmindedly.  While (A) is intentional, the outcome (B) is unintentional. It's an elegant way to convey that sense of unintended consequence.",
