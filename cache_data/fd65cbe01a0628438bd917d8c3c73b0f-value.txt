    "etymology": "かしら originally came from か知らぬ (ka shiranu) or かしらん (ka shiran), meaning \"I don't know if...\". Over time, it evolved into a standalone particle expressing uncertainty or a sense of wondering.",
    "writeup": "かしら is a sentence-ending particle used to express uncertainty or a sense of wondering. It's similar to saying \"I wonder...\" in English. While etymologically linked to か知らぬ or かしらん, meaning \"I don't know if...\", it now functions independently to add a touch of doubt or curiosity to a statement. **Important:** かしら is generally considered feminine in modern Japanese, so it's predominantly used by women.",
