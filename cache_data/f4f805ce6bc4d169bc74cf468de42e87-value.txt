    "etymology": "The particle 「より」 originates from the verb 「寄る(よる)」, meaning \"to approach\" or \"to gather.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate a point of origin or a comparison point, eventually taking on the meaning of \"than\" in modern Japanese.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「より」 is used to make comparisons. It indicates that one thing is 'more' (something) than another.  The basic structure is A 「より」 B.  This means B is more X than A.  In other words, A is *less* X than B.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「より」 attaches directly to the noun or verb being compared.\n*   In casual speech, 「より」 can sometimes appear without directly attaching to a word, implying a comparison to 'other things'.\n*   Be careful not to confuse 「より」 with other similar grammatical structures.",
