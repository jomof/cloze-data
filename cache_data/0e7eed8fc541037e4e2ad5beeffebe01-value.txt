  "writeup": "万が一 (mangaiichi), sometimes shortened to 万一 (manichi), literally translates to \"ten thousand to one.\"  It's an adverbial phrase expressing a low probability event.  Think of it as equivalent to \"just in case,\" \"in the unlikely event of,\" or \"in the worst-case scenario.\"  The phrase often introduces a precautionary measure or describes a contingency plan.  While 万一 is shorter, 万が一 is far more common in modern usage because it's easier to pronounce. The nuance often leans towards a slightly negative or cautious tone, highlighting the potential for something undesirable to occur.  This makes it unsuitable for situations requiring a purely positive or optimistic framing.  It's crucial to understand this subtle difference when selecting the appropriate expression.  The etymology reflects a simple numerical expression emphasizing rarity—a one in ten thousand chance. This rarity, however, doesn't preclude its use in daily conversation, but rather emphasizes the seriousness of the scenario it introduces.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's etymology is straightforward: 万 (man) meaning 'ten thousand' and 一 (ichi) meaning 'one.'  Thus, it literally means 'one in ten thousand,' conveying a very low probability. This numerical origin highlights its function as an expression emphasizing the unlikelihood of the event it precedes.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This is a semi-formal question, suitable for asking someone of a similar or slightly higher status. The use of 「万が一」 emphasizes the low probability of an earthquake occurring, but it is still important to be prepared."

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence, spoken by a female to a female friend, demonstrates a casual register.  The choice of 「彼」 (kare) for 'him' is typical of female speech, showcasing the speaker's gender. The use of 「万が一」 shows a bit of anxiety about not hearing from the man."

The use of 「私」 (watashi) is common for women but could be used by men too.  The question's playful nature relies heavily on the tone and context, making it a rather delicate expression. The use of 「あなた」 (anata) is appropriate when flirting with someone."
