        "[Verb, i-adjective, na-adjective, Noun] + たら": "Indicates a condition or a time when something happens. Can express 'if' or 'when'."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「たら」 originates from the past tense form 「た」 combined with the conditional particle 「ら」. It signifies a hypothetical or realized condition leading to a result.",
    "writeup": "The conjunction particle 「たら」 functions as a midpoint between \"if\" and \"when.\" It signifies the completion of action (A) and the subsequent result, action (B), stemming from (A). This can be a hypothetical scenario or a past occurrence. It's crucial to note that 「たら」 itself does not convey past tense; the sentence's overall context determines the time frame. 「たら」 emphasizes completion (完了) and materialization (成立), differentiating it from other \"if\" structures like 「ば」 and 「なら」, which emphasize hypothetical conditions. Understanding the nuance of completion is key to using 「たら」 effectively.",
