  "writeup": "たちまち is an adverb used to convey the feeling of something happening 'suddenly' or 'in a flash'.  The primary nuance of たちまち, compared to similar structures, is that it indicates something happened spontaneously and uncontrollably. Often, たちまち indicates something entering a new, ongoing state or something being completed.  It frequently appears directly before the verb phrase it modifies.  Fun fact: たちまち originally comes from the kanji structure 忽ち, the kanji itself meaning 'without thought'. This nuance is preserved in たちまち, as all actions associated with the word suggest a lack of planning or forethought.  Despite this, the kanji itself is rarely used in modern writing.",
  "etymology": "The adverb たちまち originates from the now less common kanji combination 忽ち (たちまち).  忽 (katakana: カッ, romaji: katsu) means 'suddenly' or 'instantly,' and ち (katakana: チ, romaji: chi) is a suffix often indicating a short duration.  The modern usage retains the sense of unexpected and rapid occurrence.",
