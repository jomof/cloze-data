    "etymology": "The grammar point 「として」 is derived from the particle 「と」, which indicates a result or assumption, combined with 「して」, the te-form of the verb 「する」 (to do). This combination creates the nuance of something being regarded or used 'as' something else.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「として」 expresses the idea of something being considered in a certain role, function, or capacity. It is similar to saying \"as\" in English. It is often attached directly to nouns, functioning as an adverbial particle. It highlights a particular aspect of something while acknowledging that other aspects exist. It is widely used and not particularly associated with any specific demographic.",
