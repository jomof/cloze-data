    "writeup": "The suffix 「型」 (かた/がた) is used to indicate the **type, model, pattern, or shape** of something. It is commonly attached directly to nouns. The reading changes from 「かた」 to 「がた」 due to rendaku (連濁), a sequential voicing when attached directly to a noun. However, when 「型」 is preceded by the particle 「の」, the reading remains 「かた」. Though there are two kanji, 「型」and 「形」, that can be used in this expression, 「型」 is used far more frequently than 「形」. This is primarily due to the base meanings that these kanji have.\n\n*   「型」 - Form (in regard to design, pattern, type, or model)\n*   「形」 - Shape (in regard to physical shapes only. Square, rectangle, triangle, etc)",
    "etymology": "The kanji 「型」 means \"mold,\" \"type,\" or \"model.\" It comes from the idea of something being formed or shaped according to a particular standard or pattern. Therefore, when attached as a suffix, it indicates that something is of a certain type or follows a certain pattern.",
