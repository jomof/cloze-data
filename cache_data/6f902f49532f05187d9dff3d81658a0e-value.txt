    "etymology": "The origin of は can be traced to the conditional marker ば. (Compare the spellings of は and ば.) However, in contemporary Japanese, は is used, in general, to mark information which the speaker assumes to be part of the hearer's register.",
    "writeup": "は (pronounced 「わ」) is one of the most important particles in Japanese, alongside が. は marks the topic of the sentence, describing the whole sentence broadly. が, in contrast, primarily marks single actions or statements. In many sentences (especially short ones), either は or が would be considered perfectly natural, depending on whether the speaker is simply stating something (は) or highlighting it especially (が).\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   は cannot be used to describe things that you are seeing or experiencing \"in the moment\" (right now). This is because \"in the moment\" events are considered part of a larger experience (your whole day, for example).\n*   は has two main functions. The first marks the topic of the sentence, and the second is used for contrast or making comparisons. When は is used toward (or after) the middle of a sentence, it will usually have the nuance of contrast.",
