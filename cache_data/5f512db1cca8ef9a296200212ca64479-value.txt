  "writeup": "とみえる (primarily written only in hiragana) is a phrase combining the topic-marking particle と with the verb 見える 'to appear' or 'to be visible'.  This use of the と particle marks a deduction or conclusion drawn from an observation.  Therefore, とみえる literally means 'from the way it appears, one can conclude that it's (A)'.  However, it translates more naturally as 'it can be deduced that (A)' or 'it seems that (A)'. This expression always follows the phrase it's referencing.  Nouns and な-adjectives require だ before とみえる. While this phrase expresses conjecture, it implies a degree of reasoned confidence based on observation or evidence.  The use of と in this construction is fascinating; it 'sums up' things. As a quotation, it sums up the preceding phrase. As in 一緒 ('together'), it sums up things acting mutually. And as a resultative, it summarizes causes and their effects.  Its etymology lies in the combination of the topic marker と and the verb 見える, illustrating a conclusion based on what is visible or apparent.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the level of certainty and the basis of the observation.  とみえる is a stronger statement, suggesting a more confident conclusion based on direct observation and reasoning.  The other expressions offer varying degrees of certainty, often based on indirect information or less conclusive evidence. Pay close attention to the context and the level of certainty the speaker wants to convey."
