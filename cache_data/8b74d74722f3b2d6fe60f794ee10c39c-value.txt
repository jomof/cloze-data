    "etymology": "The word 「但し」 comes from the verb 「但つ(tatsu)」, which means \"to add\" or \"to supplement\". This reflects its function of adding a condition or exception to a previous statement. The term originates from classical Japanese and retains a formal tone.",
    "writeup": "「但し」 is a conjunction used to introduce a condition, exception, or restriction to a preceding statement. It is similar to \"however\" or \"but\" in English, but it carries a more formal tone and is commonly found in written language, such as legal documents, academic papers, and formal announcements. It's important to note that 「但し」 sets a clear boundary or specific requirement, differing from more general conjunctions like 「しかし」 or 「でも」.",
