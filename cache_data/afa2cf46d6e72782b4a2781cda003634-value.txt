    "etymology": "「折(おり)」 means \"occasion,\" \"time,\" or \"opportunity.\" The addition of 「に」 marks it as the time *when* something occurs, and 「は」 adds emphasis.",
    "writeup": "「折には(ori ni wa)」 is a formal expression used to describe a specific **time or occasion** when something happens or is expected to happen. It often implies a somewhat rare or special opportunity. It is similar to 「時に(toki ni)」 \"when\", but is more formal and often suggests a positive or beneficial opportunity. It is rarely written as 「折りに(ori ni)」 without the 「は」.\n\n*   It can be used with nouns followed by 「の」 or verbs in their dictionary form.\n*   It often implies a repeated action rather than a one-time event.",
