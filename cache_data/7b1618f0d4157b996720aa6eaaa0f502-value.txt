    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てほしい」 is composed of the te-form of a verb (て) and the adjective 「ほしい」 (hoshii), meaning \"want.\" Thus, 「てほしい」 literally translates to \"want (someone to do) something.\" The 「て」 form connects the action with the desire.",
    "writeup": "As with 「がほしい」 (ga hoshii), sometimes 「ほしい」 (hoshii) can be used as an auxiliary adjective. In these cases, it follows the conjunction particle 「て」 (te). When used this way, 「てほしい」 (te hoshii) expresses that the speaker wants someone to do something.\n\nTo use 「てほしい」, simply change the verb that you want someone to do into its te-form, and then add 「ほしい」. \n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   「てほしい」 can also be used to ask questions or explain what other people want you (or somebody else) to do. Therefore, be careful when identifying who wants who to do what.",
