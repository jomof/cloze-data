    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とかで」 is a combination of 「とか」, which indicates uncertainty or listing examples, and 「で」, the conjunctive form of the copula 「だ」. Thus, it conveys a sense of \"because of something like this (among other possibilities)\".",

It implies that the speaker isn't completely sure of the reason, or that there might be other factors involved. It's similar to saying \"or something like that\" or \"they say that...\" in English.
