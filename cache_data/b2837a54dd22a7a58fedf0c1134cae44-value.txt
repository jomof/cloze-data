  "writeup": "The grammar point \"からある\" (kara aru) literally translates to \"from, there is/exists.\"  It functions to express a minimum quantity or extent.  Think of it as indicating, \"at least this much,\" \"as many as this,\" or \"as much as this.\"  This structure is typically used with numbers and counters, often in formal settings. It's commonly used when describing static quantities like distances, weights, or sizes.  **Important Considerations:** The inherent meaning suggests a lower bound; it doesn't specify an upper limit.  For living things, からいる (kara iru) would be grammatically correct, but からある is far more common in this context.  Let's delve into its etymology and nuanced usage through examples.",
  "etymology": "からある is a combination of the particle から (kara), meaning 'from,' and the verb ある (aru), meaning 'to exist' or 'to be.'  The combination elegantly conveys the sense of a quantity starting from a certain point, hence 'at least.' The inherent formality stems from the use of ある, which often carries a more formal tone compared to its informal counterpart いる (iru).",

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「少なくとも」 (at least) to emphasize the minimum weight.  The formality comes from the use of 「からある」 and the general description of physical strength."

      "japanese": "その会議には５０人からある参加者がいた。",
      "english": "There were at least 50 participants at the meeting.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "This uses 「からある」 in a straightforward way to state a minimum number of participants.  The semi-formal register reflects a neutral tone suitable for recounting an event."

      "english": "On that mountain, there are at least one hundred trees growing.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The formal register and straightforward description contribute to the objective tone, while 「からある」 sets a lower bound on the number of trees."

      "nuance": "The flirty innuendo is conveyed through the exaggerated distance. The use of 「ねえ」 (hey) and 「よね」 (you know) and the overall tone is very casual. 「よね」 is typical female speech."

  "post_example_writeup": "While \"からある\" is primarily used formally,  contextual adjustments in word choice and sentence structure can allow for flexibility in the register.  Remember the key is expressing a minimum quantity, not implying an exact number.",

      "nuance": "Unlike からある, which emphasizes a minimum quantity, 以上 indicates a quantity exceeding a specified amount.  以上 implies there may be more than the stated amount; からある focuses on the minimum."

  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion between からある and 以上, consider the nuance of the intended meaning. If you're setting a minimum, use からある; if you're stating a quantity that's definitely more than a certain amount, then 以上 is more suitable."
