    "etymology": "The kanji 上 (jō) fundamentally means \"above\" or \"on\".  In this grammar point, it metaphorically indicates a position or perspective from which something is being viewed or considered.",
    "writeup": "When the suffix 上 (じょう) attaches to a noun, it signifies that something is being discussed or evaluated **from the perspective of** that noun. Think of it as establishing a specific field or domain.  The part of the sentence following this will detail what's being considered within that domain.  It is a **formal** expression, akin to saying \"in terms of\" or \"regarding\".  You'll often see 上 used with broad categories like 仕事 (work), 教育 (education), 歴史 (history), 健康 (health), 経験 (experience), or 法律 (law).  **Important consideration:** 上 cannot be used for individual personal viewpoints. Therefore, it is incorrect to use it with names of people or organizations to express their opinions.",
