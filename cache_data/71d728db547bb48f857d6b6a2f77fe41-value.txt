  "writeup": "に至っては is an expression that highlights the most extreme example within a category.  It's often translated as \"when it comes to (A), (B)\", \"in particular, (A) is (B)\", or \"with (A) as the most extreme example, (B)\".  This phrase combines the particle に, the te-form of the verb 至る (\"to climax\", \"to culminate in\"), and the topic-marking particle は.  The literal meaning, \"culminating in (A) is (B)\", closely reflects the nuance of the English translations. 至っては follows nouns or nominalized phrases.  **Important Consideration:** Because the verb 至る itself points to extreme examples or situations on the verge of something, 至っては typically introduces surprising or astonishing, often negative or unfavorable, examples.",
