    "writeup": "がち is a suffix in Japanese that is added after nouns or the ます-stem of verbs. It conveys that someone is \"apt to do,\" \"tends to do,\" or \"is prone to do\" something. Although not always negative, がち is most frequently used to express negative tendencies.\n\nThe grammar structure がち comes from the word 勝ち (勝(か)ち), meaning \"a win.\" 勝ち in itself is used to express something that appears \"repeatedly\" or \"again and again.\" Because of this, がち may be thought of as similar to \"to win out\" in English, meaning that \"although there are many possibilities, (A) winning out is the most likely.\" This \"winning out\" may be due to preference or sheer good/bad luck.",
    "etymology": "The term 「がち」 derives from the noun 「勝ち(かち)」, meaning 'win' or 'victory'. The etymology highlights the idea that the specified tendency 'wins out' or is more likely to occur than other possibilities.",
