    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the particle 「と」, which indicates quotation or content, with 「考えられている」, the passive form of 「考える」 (to think). The passive voice here emphasizes that the thought or opinion is widely held, rather than belonging to a specific individual. Similarly, 「思われている」 uses the passive form of 「思う」 (to think).",
    "writeup": "In its usage, the case-marking particle 「と」 is often used with verbs in the passive form. Two of these regularly occurring verbs are 「考えられている」 \"to be considered\" and 「思われている」 \"to be thought.\" This grammar point is used after a phrase and translates as \"it is considered that (A)\" or \"it is thought that (A).\" It is generally used to highlight a commonly held opinion that most people agree on, not your personal opinion.\n\nThe primary reason that these constructions are used in their passive form is to show that the thought itself is not something related to the speaker's own opinions. However, people will often use this form as a way to strengthen their own opinions, in a similar way to how English speakers would say \"everyone knows that (A).\"",

            "conjugation": "dictionary (plain non-past)",
            "etymology": "「グー」 is derived from the English word \"goo\" (as in goo-goo ga-ga baby talk) via the Japanese tendency to shorten and Japanify words. It sounds like the hand gesture you make in Rock Paper Scissors."
