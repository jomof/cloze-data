        "Register": "The imperative form is generally considered direct and often impolite. It is rarely used to superiors. The negative imperative is slightly less rude, but is still direct.",
        "Affirmative": "The affirmative imperative forms (ろ/よ) are often used in written form, such as in instructions or slogans.",
        "な": "The 'な' form is more common in spoken language for negative commands.",
        "Related Expressions": "こと, なさい, てはいけない"
    },
    "etymology": "The imperative form evolved from earlier verb conjugations used to express commands and directives in classical Japanese. The use of 'な' to indicate prohibition has roots in older forms of negation.",
    "writeup": "The imperative form in Japanese is used to express commands, strong requests, or prohibitions. It's a direct and often impolite form, rarely used with superiors. There are different forms depending on the verb group and whether the command is affirmative or negative.\n\n*   **Group 1 verbs:** Change the last vowel sound to 'e' (書く → 書け).\n*   **Group 2 verbs:** Add 'ろ' (spoken) or 'よ' (written) to the stem (食べる → 食べろ/食べよ).\n*   **Irregular verbs:** '来る' becomes '来い', 'する' becomes 'しろ' (spoken) or 'せよ' (written).\n*   **Negative imperative:** Add 'な' to the dictionary form of the verb (話す → 話すな).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The affirmative imperative is often seen in written form (instructions, slogans), while the negative imperative is more common in spoken language.\n*   The imperative mood is often considered rude, so you should use it carefully. Never use it with superiors or elders unless in an emergency. Other forms such as 「～てください」 are much more polite.",
