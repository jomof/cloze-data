  "writeup": "たるに is a formal grammatical structure indicating something's position or role.  It's often translated as '(B) in the position of (A)' or '(B) as an (A)'.  It's formed from たる, the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb たり, and the particle に.  たるに follows a noun specifying a position, with a subsequent clause describing that position's attributes.  It can be used positively or negatively.  たるに is less common than たるもの, which uses the noun 者 to specifically refer to people in a particular role, conveying appropriateness or expectations of that role.  While meaning 'to be,' like である, the emphasis is on qualifications and expectations for that role. Therefore, たる isn't used for simply stating '(B) is (A)'.  Be cautious not to confuse it with the u-verb 足る (taru), meaning 'to be sufficient' or 'to be worthy'.  Historically, たり itself is a contraction of と and あり, similar to なり (a contraction of に and あり).",
  "etymology": "The structure たるに derives from the classical auxiliary verb たり (tari), which itself is a contraction of と (to) and あり (ari, 'to be').  The particle に marks the topic or position.  Therefore, たるに literally indicates 'being in the state of (something)'. The use with 者 further emphasizes the person's role and associated responsibilities.",

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "serious",

      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "interrogative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The use of 「かい？」(kai?, a casual sentence-ending particle) slightly lowers the formality, but the overall register remains semi-formal due to the core structure with **たる** (taru) and  「相応しい」 (sōōshii, 'appropriate')."

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the nuance.  たるに stresses the responsibilities and expectations associated with a specific role or position.  The other expressions, while conveying 'as' or 'to be,' lack this strong emphasis on the qualifications and suitability inherent within the role itself. Choose たるに when you want to emphasize the appropriateness of someone fulfilling a specific role, and when formality is paramount."
