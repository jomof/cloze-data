    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にしては」 combines the particle 「に」, the て-form of the verb 「する」 (to do), and the contrastive particle 「は」.  The 「に」 marks a circumstance or condition. 「する」 in its て-form acts to set up the condition, similar to 「として」.  The 「は」 highlights a surprising or unexpected outcome given the preceding condition.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「にしては」 expresses a sense of **surprise or unexpectedness** regarding a certain outcome or state, given a particular condition. It's akin to saying \"considering A, B is surprisingly the case\" or \"even for A, B is true\".  Think of it as setting a standard or expectation, and then noting that the reality doesn't quite fit. While the provided explanation mentions a similarity to 「として」 and contrasts it with the case-marking particle 「に」, it's crucial to understand 「にしては」 as an idiomatic expression.  It implies a **comparison against a norm or expectation** associated with the preceding noun or situation. It's used with nouns and noun phrases.  There's often an implicit judgment or evaluation involved. For instance, saying 「田舎**にしては**コンビニがいっぱいあるね」 implies that one usually doesn't expect many convenience stores in the countryside.",
