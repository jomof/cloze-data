  "writeup": "The suffix 姿 (sugata), meaning \"figure,\" \"shape,\" \"appearance,\" or \"looks,\" describes someone's outward appearance.  This can refer to clothing, body shape, style, or even their overall presence.  It's often translated as '(A) looking,' 'wearing (A),' 'clad in (A),' or 'performing (A).' 姿 follows verbs in their attributive form or nouns with the particle の.  It emphasizes how someone *appears* to the observer, reflecting the observer's impression of their presence.  Important Consideration: While の is sometimes omitted after nouns, especially kanji compounds, it's generally included after simpler words like 人 (person), 時 (time), 元 (original).",
  "etymology": "姿 (sugata) itself is a compound word.  The character 姿 depicts a person standing upright, suggesting the visual aspect, while the meaning incorporates aspects of posture, bearing, and presence. Its usage as a suffix to describe appearance is a later development, building upon the core meaning of visual form and presence.",
