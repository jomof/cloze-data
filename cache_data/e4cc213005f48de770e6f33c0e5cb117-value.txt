    "etymology": "The い in い-adjective comes from the inflectional ending that characterizes this type of adjective. The term 'predicate' comes from the grammatical role the adjective plays in the sentence, describing the subject.",
    "writeup": "A predicate is a word that describes the topic/subject of a sentence. The Japanese equivalent of this is a 述語 (じゅつご), which literally means \"statement word.\" As a predicate, い-Adjectives can appear by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used at the end of a sentence.\n\nWhen there are no other words apart from the adjective itself, it comes across similar to \"It's cute,\" or \"It's hot,\" and similar expressions in English. We just have to guess what the \"it\" is from context.\n\nIn many sentences, either は or が could be used to mark the word/words that the predicate is describing. However, which one sounds more natural will depend on many factors. In general, if you are specifically pointing out something as being different from other things in the same category, が will be used. For instance, if specifying that a particular item is 'expensive' compared to other similar items, the particle が would be appropriate. Conversely, は would be used for general statements or when the topic is already established.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   All い-Adjectives are words of Japanese origin.",

        "violation: `conjugations` array: Fixed inaccurate `form` values and added comprehensive `type` entries to align with common plain and polite conjugations, as per Rule 0 requiring all possible conjugations that preserve meaning. The previous list was incomplete and mislabeled.",
        "violation: `writeup` field: Removed the example sentence `「このお風呂{熱い}！」` and its detailed explanation, as per Rule 5 instructing to omit example sentences from the `writeup` and move them to the `examples` array. The explanation for particle usage was rephrased to be more general.",
        "violation: `examples` array: Changed `試験 は {簡単} だった?` to `試験 は {難しかった}?` because `簡単` is a な-adjective, not an い-adjective, which violated the grammar point being taught. This was a critical error. Added new examples to ensure coverage of all commonly used conjugations (plain non-past, plain negative past, polite negative past) and to fulfill requirements for diverse registers, settings (including flirty and first-date), and speaker/listener demographics (gender, age), as per Rule 6, 7, and 8.",
        "violation: `examples` array: Updated `conjugation` field values in example sentences to precisely match the `type` values defined in the corrected top-level `conjugations` array, as per Rule 6.",
        "violation: `pronunciation` field: Removed the `pronunciation_warning` field as it contained a usage note rather than an explanation for why Romaji doesn't fully capture pronunciation, which violates Rule 1.1 stating it should be present only if needed for pronunciation clarity."
