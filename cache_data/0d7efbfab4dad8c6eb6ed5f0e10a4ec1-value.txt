    "etymology": "The word 「あそこ」 is thought to derive from 「彼処」 (かしこ), an older term with a similar meaning. Over time, the initial 「か」 softened to 「あ」.",
    "writeup": "「あそこ」, like 「ここ」 and 「そこ」, is used to indicate a place. 「あそこ」 refers to a location that is distant from both the speaker and the listener. It roughly translates to \"that place over there\" in English. 「あそこ」 can refer to both physical locations and emotional ones. Similar to how 「あれ」 can refer back to a previously mentioned item, 「あそこ」 can refer back to a previously mentioned place, but only when both the speaker and the listener are familiar with the topic. Note that あそこ should not be confused with 「あっち」, which focuses more on direction than a specific place.",
