    "etymology": "「逆 (gyaku)」 means 'reverse' or 'opposite,' and 「に (ni)」 is a particle that, in this case, functions to turn the noun into an adverb. Thus, 「逆に」 literally means 'in the opposite direction/manner'.",
    "writeup": "「逆に」 is used to express that something is contrary to what was previously mentioned or expected. It functions as an adverb, often appearing between two phrases to show a contrast or reversal. In modern Japanese, it can also be used at the beginning of a sentence to introduce a rebuttal, or informally as a substitute for 「別に」 when asked about preferences. It indicates a shift in perspective or an unexpected outcome.",
