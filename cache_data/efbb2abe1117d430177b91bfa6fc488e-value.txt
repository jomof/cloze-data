    "meaning": "To request, to hope, to wish for something; a polite way of asking someone to do something.",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Formal",
        "Usage": "Used to make polite requests or express desires. Often seen in formal settings, announcements, or written requests.",
        "Structure": "The grammar point often follows the pattern of お/ご + verb stem + 願う/願います or verb stem + て 願う/願います."

        "[Verb -て] + 願う/願います": "Another way to politely request someone to do something."
    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「願う(ねがう)」 itself means \"to wish\" or \"to hope.\" When used in the form of 「願います(ねがいます)」, it takes on the additional meaning of \"please\" or \"I ask you to.\" The prefixes 「お(お)」 and 「ご(ご)」 are honorific prefixes that add politeness to the request. 「願う」 is a humble expression, and by adding these prefixes, it softens the request, making it more respectful.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「願う・願います」 is used to make **polite requests** or express a desire. It's commonly found in formal settings such as business correspondence, public announcements, or when asking someone to do something in a respectful manner. It is a more polite alternative to 「～てください」. 「願う」 is the plain form, while 「願います」 is the polite form. The structure typically involves attaching 「お」 or 「ご」 to the stem of a verb, followed by 「願う」 or 「願います」. Sino-Japanese verbs (nouns that can be used as verbs by adding する) often take 「ご」.",
