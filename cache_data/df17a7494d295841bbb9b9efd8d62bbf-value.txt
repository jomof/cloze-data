  "writeup": "The particle ことなく, meaning \"without ~ing,\" adds a formal and somewhat literary nuance to sentences.  It's used after the dictionary form of verbs and indicates the absence of an action. Unlike the more casual ないで, ことなく often implies a deliberate avoidance or a regretful omission.  Think of situations where something *could* have happened, but didn't.  It's frequently used to express relief at avoiding a negative outcome or sadness at missing a desired one.  The structure combines こと 'thing' with なく, the negative adverbial form of ない 'not'.  This creates a subtle contrast, emphasizing the absence of the action expressed by the preceding verb.  Mastering ことなく adds a level of sophistication and precision to your Japanese.",
  "etymology": "ことなく is a combination of こと (koto, thing) and なく (naku, negative adverbial form of ない, nai, not).  こと represents the action described by the preceding verb, and なく indicates the absence of that action. The combination elegantly expresses the lack of an action without the bluntness of simply stating the negative.",
