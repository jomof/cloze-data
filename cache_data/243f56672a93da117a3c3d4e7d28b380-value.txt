    "writeup": "「思えば」 (omoeba) is an adverbial expression used to preface a thought, indicating a sense of nostalgia, regret, or realization when reflecting on past experiences. It sets the stage for a recollection, often tinged with emotion. It's similar to saying \"now that I think about it\" or \"when I look back\" in English. Because 「思えば」 is often used in a somewhat formal setting, remember to use 「思えば」 in speeches or writing when trying to sound mature. \n\n*   **Nuance**: It often implies a new understanding or a changed perspective on something that has already happened.\n*   **Usage**: You'll typically find it at the beginning of a sentence or clause.",
    "etymology": "「思えば」 comes from the verb 「思う」(omou, to think) in its conditional form (ba-form). Thus, the literal breakdown is 「思え」 (omoe, the stem form) + 「ば」 (ba, conditional particle).",
