  },
  "etymology": "ないうちに is a combination of ない (nai, negative form of the verb 'to be'), うち (uchi, 'while,' 'during,' 'within'), and に (ni, particle indicating time or condition).  The negative form sets the crucial nuance of undesired events occurring before a certain point.",
  "writeup": "The particle phrase ないうちに (nai uchi ni) signifies 'before something happens,' but with a crucial difference from similar expressions. While うちに (uchi ni) suggests an optimal timeframe for an action, ないうちに highlights an event unfolding before something else, often resulting in a negative or undesirable outcome.  It emphasizes the lack of sufficient time or the unfortunate timing of events.  Think of it as \"before [something undesirable] happens.\"  The preceding verb is always in the negative form (nai-form), underscoring the undesired or missed opportunity.  It's frequently used to express regret or to highlight a missed chance to prevent something bad from happening. The difference between ないうちに and 前に (mae ni, 'before') is subtle; ないうちに often, but not always, emphasizes an unfavorable consequence resulting from the timing of events.",
