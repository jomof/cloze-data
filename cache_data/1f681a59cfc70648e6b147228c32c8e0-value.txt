  "writeup": "まるで～ようだ is a Japanese expression conveying a strong resemblance or similarity.  It combines まるで (marude), meaning 'entirely' or 'completely,' with ～ようだ (～yōda), an auxiliary verb expressing a likeness or conjecture. The entire phrase translates to \"It's entirely as if...\" or \"It's just as though...\"  While ようだ suggests a degree of uncertainty, まるで strengthens the comparison, emphasizing the striking similarity.  Other similar expressions, like ～みたい (～mitai), can be used, but まるで～ようだ carries a stronger sense of complete resemblance.  The structure is straightforward: まるで [description of (A)] ようだ/みたいです.  Note that while みたい is more casual, ようだ is perfectly acceptable in most contexts.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of まるで～ようだ is a simple combination of two existing particles. まるで (marude) comes from the word 丸 (maru), meaning round, circle, or whole, and で (de), a particle expressing means or manner.  This combination evolved to mean 'entirely' or 'completely'. ようだ (yōda) is the conjunctive form of よう (yō), meaning 'appearance', 'likeness', and だ (da), a copula.",
