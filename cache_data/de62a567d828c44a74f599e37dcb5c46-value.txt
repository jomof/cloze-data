    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てはいけない」 is derived from the て-form of a verb, followed by the particle 「は」, and then 「いけない」, which is the negative potential form of 「行く」 (iku, to go). Literally, it can be interpreted as \"it is not okay to go\" in the sense of doing something.",
    "writeup": "「てはいけない」 in Japanese expresses that something 'must not' or 'cannot' be done. It's formed by combining the te-form of a verb with the particle 「は」 and the word 「いけない」. While 「は」 is often omitted in other expressions, it's usually retained in this grammar point to avoid misinterpreting 「いけない」 as a second action in a sequence.\n\nTo make it more casual, 「ては」 is often contracted to 「ちゃ」, and 「では」 to 「じゃ」. For example, 「食べてはいけない」 becomes 「食べちゃいけない」. \n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   Alternatives like 「ならない」 and 「だめ」 also convey similar meanings but differ in formality:\n    *   「いけない」: Neutral, used in both spoken and written language.\n    *   「ならない」: Formal, mainly used in written language.\n    *   「だめ」: Casual, almost exclusively used in spoken language.",
