    "etymology": "加える (kuwaeru) means \"to add.\" 加えて (kuwaete) is the te-form of 加える. Here, it acts as a conjunction, meaning \"in addition to.\"",
    "writeup": "「加えて (kuwaete)」 is a formal expression that means \"in addition to\" or \"not only...but also.\" It's the te-form of the verb 「加える (kuwaeru)」, which means \"to add.\" Because it is formal, it is typically written in kanji. It is frequently used to emphasize that the second point enhances or magnifies the first. The increase can be either positive or negative. For example, 「暑さに加えて湿度も高い (atsusa ni kuwaete shitsudo mo takai)」 means \"In addition to the heat, the humidity is also high,\" emphasizing the unpleasantness of the weather.",
