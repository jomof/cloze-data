        "writeup": "が is considered the **subject marker** in Japanese. It identifies the one *performing* an action or the thing that *has* a certain feature, often something the listener isn't yet aware of.\n\nが emphasizes what comes before it by focusing on the subject performing the action or existing in a certain state. Think of it as highlighting a specific item from a group of possibilities. が shows the 'target' of a statement when other targets exist, often describing events happening 'in the moment' or independently. Be aware that using が to describe yourself can sound odd unless you're intentionally comparing yourself to others; は is more natural for general self-description, though exceptions exist.",

    "writeup": "が is a crucial particle, often the first one you learn. It marks the **subject** of a sentence. Consider it a spotlight, illuminating *who* or *what* is performing an action or possessing a quality. Importantly, が often introduces new information or emphasizes the subject when multiple options exist. Think of it as answering the implicit question, \"Which one *is* it?\"\n\nが focuses attention on the subject. It's frequently used to describe immediate situations or events happening independently. While it can describe yourself, は is usually more appropriate for general self-description.\n\nThink of が as spotlighting something specific when there are other options. が always shows the 'target' of a statement when other targets also exist. This is why が is used to describe situations that are happening either 'in the moment', or 'individually of other things'.\n\n",
