  "writeup": "The particles よう and よう な are used to express similarity or resemblance.  よう に follows verbs, while よう な follows nouns.  They convey the sense of 'in the manner of,' 'like,' or 'as if.'  The nuance can range from a simple comparison to a more metaphorical or even slightly uncertain description.  For example,  \"亀のように走る\" (kame no you ni hashiru) means \"to run like a turtle.\"  However, a sentence like \"彼は人を殺すような目をしている\" (kare wa hito o korosu you na me o shiteiru) translates to \"He has eyes as if he's about to kill someone,\"  implying a more uncertain or metaphorical resemblance. Mastering this subtle difference is key to using よう に/よう な effectively.",
  "etymology": "The particle よう (yō) originates from the verb 様 (yō), meaning \"appearance\" or \"manner.\"  The addition of に (ni) creates an adverbial phrase indicating \"in the manner of.\"  よう な (yō na) is a slightly softer form, often used for less precise comparisons. The 'na' adds a descriptive nuance.",
