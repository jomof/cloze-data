  "writeup": "The particle だけ (dake) functions similarly to 'only' or 'just' in English.  Its core meaning emphasizes restriction or limitation, indicating that something is the sole or exclusive element in a given context.  While seemingly simple, its usage nuances can be subtle.  It attaches to the stem of nouns, na-adjectives (using the 'na' form), and i-adjectives (in their dictionary form). Understanding its function requires careful attention to context.  This particle is employed across all registers, making it versatile but requiring a nuanced grasp of its implied meaning in each situation.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of だけ is complex and not fully understood.  However, it's believed to be related to the verb だける (dakeru), meaning 'to be able to do something alone'.  This connection highlights the inherent limitation implied by だけ – the action or state is limited to a single item or instance.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "私**だけ**行きます。",
      "english": "Only I'm going.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence is straightforward and casual, suitable for communication among close friends or family. The use of 私 (watashi) is typical in informal settings."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "リンゴ**だけ**を食べました。",
      "english": "I only ate apples.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a simple structure and is appropriate for casual conversation.  The simplicity of 「リンゴだけ」 (ringo dake) reflects the ease with which だけ can modify even single-word phrases."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "コーヒー**だけ**下さい。",
      "english": "Just coffee, please.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "ordering",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite form 「下さい」(kudasai) elevates the register, making this appropriate for a restaurant or cafe.  The directness of 「コーヒーだけ」(koohii dake) is polite but efficient, implying a clear preference."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "私**だけ**じゃ、無理だよ。",
      "english": "I can't do it alone.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "apologetic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of じゃ (ja) and よ (yo) are common in male speech, particularly casual. The sentence is expressive of inability, yet doesn't sound overtly rude. 「私だけじゃ」 (watashi dake ja) emphasizes the insufficient support."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたと**だけ**、ずっと一緒にいたい。",
      "english": "I only want to be with you forever.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "This sentence, using 「あなたとだけ」(anata to dake), is profoundly romantic and intimate.  The use of  「いたい」(itai)  conveys longing, ideal for a romantic setting and spoken between intimate partners. The female speaker's directness is powerful in this context."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "私**だけ**が知っています。",
      "english": "Only I know.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the formal subject marker が (ga) and verb ending ています (teimasu), creating a more formal register suitable for serious settings.  The emphasis on 「私だけ」(watashi dake) is very strong in the formal setting."
    }

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that the placement of だけ significantly affects the meaning and emphasis.  It usually modifies the phrase immediately preceding it.",

    {
      "term": "しか～ない",
      "meaning": "There's only, Nothing but",
      "kind": "synonym",

      "meaning": "To emphasize '~only', Nothing but",
      "kind": "synonym",

    {
      "term": "だけで",
      "meaning": "Just by, Just with",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "だけで focuses on the means or instrument by which an action is accomplished, contrasting with だけ's emphasis on the limited scope of the action itself."
    },
    {
      "term": "だけでなく",
      "meaning": "Not only… but also",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "In contrast to the restrictive nature of だけ, だけでなく introduces an additional element, negating the exclusivity implied by だけ."
    },
    {
      "term": "ばかり",
      "meaning": "Just, Only, Nothing but",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "ばかり shares similarities with だけ, but often carries a connotation of excessiveness or repetitiveness, even implying a negative aspect to the repetition, such as 「毎日ビールばかり飲んでいる」(Mainichi biiru bakari nondeiru) which means 'drinking only beer every day'."
    },
    {
      "term": "きり",
      "meaning": "Only, Just, Since",
      "kind": "synonym",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "Distinguishing these similar expressions hinges on understanding the subtle differences in emphasis and implication.  While they all relate to limitation or exclusivity, their connotations vary, influencing the overall tone and meaning of the sentence.  Consider the context and the desired level of emphasis when choosing the most appropriate particle."
