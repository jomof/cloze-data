    "writeup": "「がいる」 is a common construction meaning \"to exist\", or \"there is\", used for living or animate things. It combines the particle 「が」 and the verb 「いる」. The polite form of 「いる」 is 「います」.\n\nImportant points:\n\n*   Because these examples describe living things, 「いる」 is the correct verb. 「ある」 is used for inanimate objects.\n*   「いる」 is a る-Verb (Ichidan verb) because the 「る」 is removed when conjugating to 「います」.\n*   The kanji form 「居る」 is common and should be learned early.\n*   The 「が」 in 「がいる」 is often omitted in casual speech, like in manga or instant messaging.",
