        "[Verb in dictionary form] + しかない": "Expresses the idea that there is no other option but to do the specified verb.",
        "[Noun] + しかない": "Expresses the idea that there is only the specified noun available."
    },
    "etymology": "しかない is composed of しか (shika), an adverbial particle indicating limitation, and ない (nai), the negative form of ある (aru), meaning 'to exist' or 'to be.' Therefore, literally, it means 'only exists not,' implying that nothing else exists or is possible.",
    "writeup": "しかない is a common expression paired with verbs to mean \"to have no choice but (A)\" or \"there is only (A).\" It emphasizes that nothing apart from (A) is possible. Attach it directly to the dictionary form of the verb you want to highlight as the only possible action.\n\nUnlike だけ (dake), which implies choosing one option out of several, しかない always suggests that (A) is the *only* option, making it a stronger statement. It implies circumstances have resulted in (A) being the only course of action.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   In casual language (manga, anime), しかない can be abbreviated to っきゃない (kyanai). While not common in daily speech, recognizing it is helpful.\n*   しかない can also be used with nouns to mean \"only\".",
