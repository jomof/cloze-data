  "writeup": "The particle みたい (mitai) means \"like\" or \"similar to.\"  It's derived from the adjective みたいだ (mitai da), meaning \"it seems like.\"  This construction allows you to express a resemblance or similarity to something else.  The form みたいに (mitaini) is used with verbs, while みたいな (mitaina) is used with nouns.  Understanding this distinction is crucial.  The element being compared doesn't always immediately follow みたい; it can appear later in the sentence, particularly in longer constructions. While conveying resemblance, often based on visual perception, it's essential not to confuse it with 見たい (mitai), which means \"to want to see.\"  This is a common error for learners.",
  "etymology": "The particle みたい derives from the adjective みたいだ (mitai da), literally meaning 'it seems like'. The suffix -tai in 見たい (mitai, 'to want to see') and みたい (mitai, 'like') shares a common origin. However, their usages have evolved to express fundamentally different meanings.",

This careful consideration will prevent mix-ups."
