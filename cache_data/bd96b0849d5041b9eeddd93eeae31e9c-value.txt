  "writeup": "いよいよ, primarily written in hiragana, is an adverb signifying the culmination or intensification of a process.  It conveys a sense of something finally happening after a prolonged period or a gradual build-up.  Think of it as expressing the feeling of 'at last!' or the gradual increase signified by 'more and more.'  Its placement at the beginning of a clause is typical. While versatile, it leans towards a more casual register compared to more formal alternatives like ついに. The key lies in understanding its context:  a conclusive event implies 'finally,' while a continuing state points to 'more and more.'  For example, \"いよいよ雨が止んだ\" suggests 'finally, the rain stopped,' whereas \"いよいよ寒くなってきた\" implies 'it's getting colder and colder.'",
  "etymology": "The term いよいよ is a reduplication of いよ (iyo).  While the exact origin of いよ is debated, its use in classical Japanese suggests a connection to intensification or progress toward a conclusion.  The reduplication enhances the sense of culmination or mounting intensity.",
