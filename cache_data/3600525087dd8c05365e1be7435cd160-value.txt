  "writeup": "The grammar pattern \"１～たりとも～ない\" is primarily used in negative sentences to emphasize the absolute lack of exception.  It follows numerical words or nouns, conveying meanings such as 'not even one (A)' or 'not a single (A)'.  However, its etymology reveals a more nuanced understanding.  \"たり\" is an auxiliary verb suggesting examples, while \"とも\" is a conjunction particle implying approximate limits.  Therefore, a literal translation could be 'even limited to (A) as an example, not (B),' with the 'not (B)' stemming from the sentence's negative structure.  This makes it a highly formal expression, unsuitable for casual conversation.  The set phrase 何人たりとも (nani hitotari tomo) meaning 'no matter who, no exceptions' is a more common application of this structure.  This pattern is typically used in formal settings, such as official documents or serious speeches and is generally avoided in casual or informal communication.",
