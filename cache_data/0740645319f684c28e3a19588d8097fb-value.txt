    "etymology": "The word 「せめて」 comes from the verb 「責める(せめる)」, meaning \"to blame\" or \"to press\". The nuance is that the action being described is the *least* one should do, almost implying a sense of responsibility or obligation.",
    "writeup": "「せめて」is an adverb indicating that doing something is the minimum expected to achieve a desired outcome. It translates to \"at least\" in English. Stemming from 「責める」, it often suggests an onus or responsibility to do the action, rather than it simply being a minimum amount. It's often used with grammar points expressing desire or opinions, such as 「たい」, 「ほしい」, 「てほしい」, 「べき」, and others. 「せめて」 usually appears at the beginning of a sentence or phrase, modifying the entire statement.",
