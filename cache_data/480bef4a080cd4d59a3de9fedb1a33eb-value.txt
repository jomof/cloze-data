    "etymology": "「そういう」 comes from 「そう」 (like that) + 「いう」 (to say). It literally means 'saying like that,' and it is used to describe the nature or kind of something.  The こそあど words (kosoado kotoba) こそあど are demonstrative words in Japanese, like 'this', 'that', and 'that over there.'",
    "writeup": "「そういう」 is part of the こそあど (kosoado) family of words, which includes 「こう」, 「そう」, 「ああ」, and 「どう」.  These are used with the verb 「言う」 (iu) to form expressions indicating 'in the way of (A),' where (A) is 'this' (「これ」), 'that' (「それ」), 'that over there' (「あれ」), or 'what' (「どれ」) in questions.  As a pre-noun adjectival word, it's placed directly before a noun.\n\n「こう」, 「そう」, 「ああ」, and 「どう」 relate to 「これ」, 「それ」, 「あれ」, and 「どれ」, but function as adverbs meaning 'as such' when used alone. Be careful not to confuse the adverb 「そう」 (然う), with the auxiliary verb 「そう」. The adverb 「そう」 comes from the kanji 然う, while the auxiliary verb has no kanji.",
