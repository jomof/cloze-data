  "writeup": "すぎる (sugiru) is an extremely common and versatile word meaning \"too much,\" \"excessive,\" or \"over-the-top.\"  It's an adverbial verb that modifies adjectives and verbs, adding the nuance of excess.  Attach it to the masu-stem of verbs or the stem of i-adjectives (remove the い) and na-adjectives (remove the な).  A common casual variation omits the る, using すぎ (sugi) instead. This is perfectly acceptable in informal settings.  When combined with ない (nai), it creates なさすぎる (nasasugiru) meaning \"not enough.\"  The most important exception is with いい (ii, 'good'), where you use よすぎる (yosugiru), not いすぎる (isugiru), because いい's stem is よ (yo). The negative forms of すぎる also exist and can be tricky, especially when combined with ない, changing the meaning depending on the positioning.  Mastering its various conjugations and nuances is key to natural-sounding Japanese.",
  "etymology": "The word すぎる likely originates from the combination of the word 'すぎ' (sugi, meaning 'exceeding' or 'going beyond') and the verb suffix 'る' (-ru), which transforms the word into a verb.",
