    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ませんか」 is derived from the ます form of a verb, conjugated into its negative form 「ません」, followed by the question particle 「か」. This construction creates a polite question implying an invitation or suggestion. 「ます」 indicates politeness, 「ません」 negates the verb, and 「か」 turns the phrase into a question.",
    "writeup": "「ませんか」 is a polite expression used to invite someone to do something with you or make a suggestion. It's equivalent to asking, \"Won't you do (A) with me?\" or \"Would you like to?\". While similar to 「ましょうか」, 「ませんか」 more directly conveys an invitation, whereas 「ましょうか」 can sound more like a suggestion.\n\n*   **Register:** This expression is inherently polite, so it's suitable for use with people you don't know well or in more formal situations.\n*   **Usage:** To emphasize that you want to do something 'together,' you can add 「一緒に (いっしょに)」, meaning 'together,' for clarification.",

Use 「ませんか」 when you genuinely want to invite someone to do something with you."
