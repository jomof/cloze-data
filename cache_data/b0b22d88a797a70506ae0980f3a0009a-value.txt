    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を問わず」 comes from the verb 「問う (とう)」, meaning \"to ask, to inquire\", combined with the archaic negative auxiliary verb 「ず」. Literally, it means \"without asking\", but it has evolved to mean \"regardless of\" or \"irrespective of\".",
    "writeup": "「を問わず」 is a formal expression primarily used in writing and formal speech. It indicates that something applies regardless of certain conditions or distinctions. It's similar to saying \"regardless of,\" \"irrespective of,\" or \"no matter\".\n\n*   It's often used after nouns to indicate that the following statement is true, regardless of the noun's attribute (e.g., age, gender, nationality).\n*   It can also follow question words (か, かどうか) to express that the statement holds true whether the condition is met or not.\n\nWhile 「を問わず」 can be similar to 「に関わらず」 (regardless of), nuance can differ slightly. 「を問わず」 is useful when emphasizing the scope something applies to. The particle 「を」 marks the thing that is \"not being questioned\" or considered a factor.",
