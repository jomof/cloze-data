    "etymology": "The grammar point やすい comes from the i-adjective 易(やす)い, meaning \"easy\".  When attached to the ます-stem of a verb, it transforms to indicate the ease of performing that action.",
    "writeup": "「やすい」 is an い-adjective that attaches to the ます-stem of verbs (the form of a verb that can be used as a noun). When attached this way, it means \"easy to (A)\", where (A) is the verb preceding 「やすい」.  Sometimes, 「やすい」 can also convey a nuance closer to \"prone to (A)\" or \"likely to (A)\", particularly with verbs related to emotions or tendencies.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Be careful not to confuse this with the adjective 安(やす)い, meaning \"cheap\".  The kanji 安い should never be used with verbs to mean \"easy\".\n*   While the kanji 易い exists, 「やすい」 is most commonly written in hiragana.\n*   Although 易い is technically an い-adjective, it's rarely used on its own. In such cases, the な-adjective 簡単(かんたん) is much more natural.",
