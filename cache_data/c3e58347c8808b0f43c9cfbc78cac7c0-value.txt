    "etymology": "The adverb せめて derives from the verb 責める (せめる), which means \"to blame,\" \"to criticize,\" or \"to press someone to do something.\"  The connection lies in the idea that せめて expresses the minimum expectation or demand, as if pressing for at least that much.",
    "writeup": "The adverb せめて, derived from the verb 責める (to blame, to press), signifies the **minimum expectation** required to achieve a desired outcome.  It translates to \"at least\" in English and often appears at the beginning of a sentence, modifying the entire phrase.  The nuance carried by せめて suggests a sense of obligation or responsibility related to the minimum action being described.  Because of this underlying sense of demanding the minimum, it frequently pairs with expressions of desire or opinion, such as ～たい (want to do), ～ほしい (want something), ～てほしい (want someone to do), and べき (should do).",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "friendly",
            "nuance": "The speaker uses the 「～ても良いから」 construction to be lenient about the rice, but then uses 「せめて」 to emphasize the minimum expectation regarding the sashimi. This creates a contrast highlighting the importance of finishing the sashimi.",
            "etymology": "「刺身」 (さしみ) literally means 'pierced body', referring to the method of preparation."

            "listener_age": "younger",
            "nuance": "The use of 「～なさい」 makes this a mild command, suitable for speaking to someone younger or in a subordinate position. 「せめて」 underscores that this homework is the absolute minimum expected."

            "nuance": "The 「～よ」 particle is often used by females to soften a statement or express a personal feeling.  The speaker expresses surprise and then uses 「せめて」 to clearly state the minimum acceptable amount, highlighting the inadequacy of the initial offer.",
