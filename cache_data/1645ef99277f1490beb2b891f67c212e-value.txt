  "writeup": "The grammar pattern ては〜ては highlights the repetitive nature of actions (A) and (B).  It translates to \"doing (A) and (B) repeatedly.\"  These actions often contrast, such as starting and stopping, or going forward and backward.  This structure uses verbs in the て-form; therefore, it may sometimes appear as では.  Note that ちゃ and じゃ are abbreviated forms sometimes used, but consistency in abbreviation is crucial for maintaining natural formality.  A caution:  ては might appear only once without altering the repeated action meaning, usually when context already implies repetition. ",
  "etymology": "The ては～ては structure combines the て-form of verbs, indicating a continuous or connected action, with the は particle, marking a topic or theme. The repetition emphasizes a cyclical or alternating pattern of behavior. The use of は instead of other particles allows for a nuanced emphasis on the contrasting actions rather than focusing on their mere succession.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "ここ最近は食べては寝て、食べては寝ての繰り返しだから太ってきた。",
      "english": "Recently I've been eating and sleeping, eating and sleeping, so I've gained weight.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the casual「だから」 (dakara), indicating a relaxed conversational tone. The repeated action is emphasized by repeating the phrase \"食べては寝て\" (tabete wa nete).  This straightforward presentation suits a casual reflection."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "仕事ではミスしては怒られ、怒られてはミスをする。毎日この繰り返しだから仕事を辞めようと思う。",
      "english": "At work, I make a mistake and get yelled at, get yelled at and make a mistake.  This repeats every day, so I'm thinking of quitting.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence utilizes the casual 「辞めようと思う」(yameyou to omou), showing the speaker's internal contemplation.  The repetitive nature of making mistakes and getting scolded is underscored by the repeated use of \"ミスしては怒られ\"(mishi shite wa okorare) and \"怒られてはミスをする\"(okorarete wa misu o suru). This structure is fitting for expressing a serious concern in a casual setting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "運動しないで食っちゃ寝食っちゃ寝ばかりしていると牛になるよ！",
      "english": "If you eat and sleep, eat and sleep without exercising, you'll turn into a cow!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence employs the colloquial contractions 「食っちゃ寝」(kucchan ne) and the emphatic exclamation 「よ！」(yo!), enhancing the humorous and informal tone.  The repetition of \"食っちゃ寝\" adds to the comedic effect, which illustrates the casual nature of the conversation and the speaker’s humorous intent.  The use of the abbreviated form 「食っちゃ寝」 (kucchan ne) is casual slang."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "薬を飲んじゃ吐いて、飲んじゃ吐いてを何回も繰り返したから喉が痛い。",
      "english": "My throat hurts because I've been repeatedly taking medicine and throwing up.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The speaker uses the casual, shortened form 「飲んじゃ」(nonjya) and the causal particle 「から」(kara) to explain the cause of their throat pain. The repetition of 「飲んじゃ吐いて」(nonjya haite) and 「何回も」(kaikai mo) strengthens the emphasis of the repeated action."

      "english": "To be able to run 5 kilometers without a break, you need to repeatedly run a kilometer until you're tired and take a break, doing this every day for a month.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the polite form 「です」(desu) and employs the formal and somewhat lengthy sentence structure common in instructional contexts.  The repetition of the phrase \"１キロ走っては休憩して\" (ikiro hashitte wa kyuukei shite) is key to understanding the required repetitive nature of the exercise. The formality of the sentence is appropriate given its function as a set of instructions."

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",

      "nuance": "The sentence employs the formal ending 「です」(desu). The repetitive nature, \"歩いては走り、走っては歩き\" (aruite wa hashiri, hashitte wa aruki), is presented clearly, yet concisely, suitable for an informative yet formal style. The polite form reinforces the formal register, making it appropriate for a public or professional setting."

      "japanese": "最近、インターネット接続が悪い。接続しては切断して、接続しては、切断して。イライラさせられる。",
      "english": "My internet connection's been terrible lately.  It keeps connecting and disconnecting, driving me crazy.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "complaining",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual tone comes from the simple sentence structure and the direct expression of frustration, 「イライラさせられる」(iraira saserareru).  The repetition of \"接続しては切断して\" (setsuzoku shite wa setudan shite) emphasizes the annoyance. The sentence avoids overly formal language, making it appropriate for casual conversation."

      "japanese": "田舎者：「働いては寝て、働いては寝てばかりだ。このような人生はダメだ。」",

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal language 「です」(desu) and the use of 「によると」(ni yoru to) indicate a formal report or presentation of research findings.  The repetition emphasizes the cyclical nature of the study method. The structured style and polite tone make it appropriate for academic contexts."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あくびをしてはフリスクを食べ、あくびをしてはフリスクを食べ、何とか起きていられた。",
      "english": "I managed to stay awake by repeatedly yawning and eating mints.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "storytelling",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual language, the repetition of \"あくびをしてはフリスクを食べ\" (akubi o shite wa furisuku o tabe), and the slightly humorous \"何とか起きていられた\" (nan to ka okite ira reta) create a relatable storytelling tone."
