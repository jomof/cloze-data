    "etymology": "The term 「あり」 comes from the literary form of the verb 「有る(ある)」, meaning \"to exist\" or \"to have\". Its use as a noun extends from this, indicating the presence or possibility of something.",
    "writeup": "「あり」 itself is the literary form of the verb 「有る(ある)」 'to be' or 'to have', used in a similar way to 「なし」. Rather than meaning that something is \"without (A)\", it shows that something is \"with (A), amongst other things\". This 'amongst other things' is important, as 「あり」 will primarily be used when something is being presented as a single possibility among many possibilities.\n\n「あり」 can often be used simply as a reply to a statement to indicate agreement, or that the listener thinks that what the speaker is saying is possible.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Occasionally, the kanji 「在る(ある)」 may sometimes also be used. Although the difference between these two kanji is slight, 「有り」 indicates 'inclusiveness as part of a whole', while 「在り」 focuses more on 'stand-alone existence'.",
