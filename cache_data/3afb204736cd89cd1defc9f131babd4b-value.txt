  "writeup": "This grammar point, Verb[ない]もの(だろう)か, expresses a wish or a sense of regret that something is not possible.  It literally translates to something like \"I wonder if it's really a thing that can't…\" or \"Isn't there a way to…\". The structure uses the negative form of a verb ([ない] form), followed by もの, which means \"thing,\" and then either か (a question particle) or a combination of だろう (a tentative inference particle) and か.  The overall effect conveys a feeling of helplessness or longing for a different outcome. This construction is quite formal and frequently used in situations where expressing frustration or disappointment is appropriate. While primarily seen with verbs, it can also be applied to nouns to express a lack of something desired.  The polite form でしょうか can replace だろう+か for a more polite tone.",
  "etymology": "The structure's formality stems from the use of もの, a relatively formal word, and the combination of the negative verb form with the nuanced particles か and だろう.  The combination emphasizes the speaker's wish or regret.  The use of だろう adds a layer of tentative inference, making the wish less direct and more thoughtful, suitable for formal interactions.",
