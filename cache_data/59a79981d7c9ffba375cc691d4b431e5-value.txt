  "writeup": "The adverb 既に (すで ni), meaning \"already,\" is a formal alternative to もう.  It typically appears at the beginning of a phrase, emphasizing the prior completion of an action. However,  既に carries nuances beyond a simple 'already'.  It often implies finality or an irreversible state, sometimes conveying the sense of something being \"too late.\"  This stems from its underlying meaning of complete and unchangeable completion.  Understanding this subtle difference is key to using it correctly in various contexts.  The word itself is quite formal, so bear that in mind when considering your audience.",
  "etymology": "既に (すで ni) is a compound word.  The component すで (sude) has roots in the concept of \"already\" or \"completed.\"  The particle に (ni) here functions as an adverbial particle, modifying the verb that follows and adding the sense of 'completely' or 'to the point where something is completed'.",

      "setting": "reflective",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of \"ちゃった\"  「ちゃった」 shows a more casual and slightly feminine register. The speaker is expressing a feeling, not stating a fact.   The sentence is slightly melancholic because of the uncertainty and the tone of the ending '...' shows uncertainty."

      "conjugation": null,

      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike すでに, もう is informal and doesn't carry the same implication of finality or irreversibility.  It is a much more versatile word.  It's perfectly acceptable in most situations, while すでに is only acceptable in formal situations."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion between もう and すでに, consider the formality of the situation and the degree to which you want to emphasize the finality of the action.  Use もう for casual conversation and すでに for more formal settings where the completed action is definitive."
