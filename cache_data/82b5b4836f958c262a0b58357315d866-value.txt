  "writeup": "如く・如き・如し (gotoku, gotoki, gotoshi) are classical auxiliary verbs in Japanese, sharing a meaning similar to the modern よう ('manner of').  They emphasize the resemblance or appearance of something based on observation, translating as 'like,' 'similar to,' or 'as if.' ごとし is the base form, typically found at sentence ends. ごとく acts adverbially before verbs or clause breaks, while ごとき is attributive, directly preceding nouns. All three follow の after nouns and が after verbs.  While よう is now common, 如く・如き・如し remain in formal writing and fixed expressions.  They carry a distinctly literary, almost archaic feel, rarely used in everyday conversation.  The kanji 如 itself means 'likeness,' reflecting the grammar point's emphasis on resemblance. This is visible in words like 如何 (ika ni), meaning 'how'.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of 如く・如き・如し traces back to classical Japanese grammar.  The root 如 (go) means 'like' or 'similar to,' and the suffixes く (-ku), き (-ki), and し (-shi) are grammatical particles that add nuances of adverbial, adjectival, and auxiliary verb functions respectively.  These forms reflect the evolution of Japanese grammar from a more inflectional system to the more analytic system used today.",

      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "attributive form",

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「貴方の」and the formal 「如し」in 「太陽の如し」demonstrates respect while maintaining a romantic tone. The expression 「私の心を明るく照らしてくれます」 further softens the formality and enhances the romantic sentiment.  The speaker is showing admiration in a respectful way."
