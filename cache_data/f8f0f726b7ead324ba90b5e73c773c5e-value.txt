    "etymology": "「のみならず」is derived from 「のみ」 (only), the negative form of the verb 「なる」 (naru, to become) which is 「なら」, and the auxiliary verb 「ず」 (zu, not). Literally, it implies 'not only that it becomes [A], but also [B]'.",
    "writeup": "「のみならず」 is a formal expression indicating \"not only A, but also B.\" It's similar to 「だけでなく」 or 「ばかりでなく」, but more formal.  It can connect to nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Occasionally, it can function as a conjunction at the beginning of a sentence, meaning \"furthermore\" or \"moreover.\" Because of its formality, it is primarily used in written language, formal speeches, or academic contexts. Consider it more stilted than 「だけでなく」 and choose it accordingly.",
