    "etymology": "次第 (shidai) originally means \"order\" or \"sequence.\" This meaning extends to indicate that one event will happen immediately following another in a set order, or that a result is dependent on the order of things.",
    "writeup": "The noun 次第 (shidai) means \"order\" or \"sequence.\" Grammatically, it can function as a noun or a suffix. The meaning of 次第 depends on the word type it connects to. This grammar point focuses on its usage with verbs and nouns, where it translates to \"as soon as\" or \"depending on.\"\n\n*   **Verb-ます stem + 次第:** Indicates that the second action will occur immediately after the first. For example, \"終わり次第\" (owari shidai) means \"as soon as it ends.\"\n*   **Noun + 次第:** Indicates that something depends on the noun. For example, \"天気次第\" (tenki shidai) means \"depending on the weather.\"\n\nThis grammar point is versatile but maintains a formal register. It's used to express a direct and consequential relationship between two events or conditions.",
