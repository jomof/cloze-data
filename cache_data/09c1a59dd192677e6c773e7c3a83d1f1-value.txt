  "writeup": "に応じて (ni ōjite) is a nuanced grammatical structure crucial for expressing conditional relationships in Japanese. It combines the particle に (ni), indicating a modifying condition, and the て-form of the verb 応じる (ōjiru), meaning 'to respond to' or 'to comply with'.  The overall meaning translates most directly to \"depending on,\" \"according to,\" or \"in response to.\"  Crucially, it suggests a reactive or adaptive action in response to the preceding noun or clause.  This differs from similar expressions like に合わせて (ni awasete), which implies a proactive adjustment or preparation.  The form に応じた (ni ōjita) is used adjectivally. For example,  年齢に応じた (nenrei ni ōjita) means 'age-appropriate'.  Mastering に応じて allows for sophisticated expression of conditional actions in many contexts.",
  "etymology": "The core of this grammar point lies in the verb 応じる (ōjiru).  This verb is built upon the kanji 応 (ō), meaning 'response' or 'application,' and じる (-jiru), a suffix often indicating action or behavior. Therefore, the etymological roots highlight the reactive nature of に応じて, emphasizing the response to a given circumstance.",

      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses a plain, semi-formal register suitable for an instructor addressing students.  The verb 変えます (kae masu) is polite but not overly formal.  The structure of the sentence clearly shows the direct relation between the students' level and the alteration of the lesson plan."

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the semi-formal register appropriate for making a proposal within a professional or travel-planning context. The verb 調整します (chōsei shimasu) is polite and suitable for this situation."

      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The casual register is appropriate for a supportive and encouraging tone. The use of 君 (kimi) shows closeness and informality. The phrase 見つけよう (mitsuke yō) uses the volitional form, suggesting a joint effort.  The male speaker's use of 君 (kimi) is natural when speaking to a woman, though it's sometimes slightly condescending when used with a male."

      "nuance": "The use of よ (yo) at the end gives it a slightly suggestive tone, suitable for a flirty setting.  The casual register is appropriate for this romantic context, and the speaker is showing consideration for the listener's feelings.  This sentence, 「今日の気分に応じて」 (kyou no kibun ni ōjite), is suitable for both male and female speakers, depending on the tone of voice.  The sentence is versatile, suitable for use between close friends, new lovers, etc."

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "Choosing between these similar expressions requires careful consideration of the context.  If the action is a direct response to a change, use に応じて. If the action is a pre-emptive measure or adjustment, use に合わせて. If the action merely follows a plan or instruction, use にしたがって. For a simple cause-and-effect relationship, use 次第で.  Consider the nuance of 'reacting' vs 'adjusting' vs 'following' when making your choice."
