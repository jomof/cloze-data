  "etymology": "The particle 「つ」 originates from the classical Japanese particle 「つ」, which served as a conjunction or a possessive particle. In this grammar point, it connects verbs to indicate repeated, alternating actions.",
  "writeup": "The 「つ〜つ」 structure highlights **contrasting verbs**, often translated as \"to be doing (A) and (B) over and over,\" where actions happen repeatedly in sequence. 「つ」 connects to the conjunctive form of verbs, with (A) and (B) usually in direct order.  It is also common to see the same verb repeated, with the (A) verb in standard form and the (B) verb in passive form, translating as \"to do (A) and to have (A) done to oneself.\"  This grammar pattern is used with a limited set of words. Some standard combinations include:\n\n*   行きつ戻りつ - To go back and forth.\n*   浮きつ沈みつ - To surface and submerge (to bob).\n*   見えつ隠れつ - To go in and out of sight.\n*   とつおいつ (from 取りつ置きつ) - To waver between.\n*   矯めつ眇めつ - To take a good look.\n*   組んず解れつ - To intertwine and release (to grapple).\n*   抜きつ抜かれつ - To pull away and be pulled away from (to be neck and neck).\n*   持ちつ持たれつ - To have and to be held (to give and take).\n*   押しつ押されつ - To press and be pressed.\n*   追いつ追われつ - To overtake and be overtaken.\n*   差しつ差されつ - To pour and be poured (to take turns exchanging drinks).",
