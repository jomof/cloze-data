    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にもとづいて」 is derived from the particle 「に」, the verb 「基づく（もとづく）」 (to be based on), and the te-form ending 「て」.  「基（もと）」 signifies 'origin' or 'foundation'. Thus, 「にもとづいて」 literally means 'originating from' or 'having its foundation in'.",
    "writeup": "The expression **にもとづいて** (ni motozuite) signifies that something is \"based on\" or \"in accordance with\" something else.  It combines the particle に, the verb 基づく (motozuku - to be based on), and the connective て-form.  This grammar point is used to present a judgment, action, or conclusion that stems from a particular basis.  The structure is **[Basis] にもとづいて [Judgment/Action/Conclusion]**.  The past tense form, **に基づいた** (ni motozuita), can directly modify a noun to indicate that the noun is based on something, following the structure **[Basis] に基づいた [Noun]**. The kanji 基 (moto) itself means \"foundation\" or \"base\", highlighting the idea of something originating from something else. This expression can also imply that something was produced, created, or invented based on something else.",
