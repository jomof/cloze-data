    "etymology": "The particle 「だに」 is believed to originate from the classical Japanese word 「たに」 (tani), which was an emphatic particle. Over time, 「たに」 evolved into 「だに」, retaining its function of emphasizing the preceding word or phrase to express a strong sentiment or minimal condition.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「だに」 is used to emphasize that something as small or slight as the preceding word is enough to cause a certain feeling or outcome. It conveys a sense of \"even,\" \"just,\" or \"merely.\" It is most often found in formal writing and speech. It often appears with verbs relating to thinking, feeling, or perception, to highlight the emotional impact of even considering something. It's a somewhat literary expression, so you're more likely to encounter it in books or formal speeches than in everyday conversation. Think of it as adding a dramatic flair to the statement.",
