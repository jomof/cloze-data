    "etymology": "The particle まで originates from the verb 待つ (matsu), meaning \"to wait\". Over time, its usage evolved to denote a limit, boundary, or endpoint in time or space, similar to waiting for a specific moment or destination.",
    "writeup": "まで is a particle that indicates a limit, roughly translating to \"as far as (A)\" or \"until the point of (A).\" When used with verbs, it often translates as \"until (A) happens.\" Because まで implies reaching a point or limit, it's typically used with verbs in the non-past tense to express anticipation or a future endpoint. The context usually clarifies the timing, or later verbs in the sentence will indicate the past tense. \n\nFor example, consider this construction: 授業が始まるまで、先生が来なかった。This translates to \"The teacher didn't come until the class started.\" Note that 始まる ('start') is in the non-past tense, but the overall sentence expresses a past event through 来なかった ('did not come').",

            "nuance": "This sentence uses まで to indicate the point in time until the teacher arrived. The use of the past tense 「来なかった」 at the end of the sentence indicates that the entire event is in the past, even though 「始まる」 is in present tense."
