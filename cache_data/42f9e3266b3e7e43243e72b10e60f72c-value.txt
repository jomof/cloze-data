    "writeup": "Think of 「であれ」 as a more formal way of saying \"even if\" or \"no matter.\" It comes from the formal copula 「である」.  The 「あれ」 part is like a strong, almost commanding form of 「ある」 (to be), while 「であろうと」 uses the volitional form 「あろう」 combined with 「と」.  So, literally, it's like saying \"so it may be, but...\" emphasizing that whatever comes before 「であれ」 doesn't change the outcome.  You'll often see it used with words like 「どんな」 (what kind of) or 「たとえ」 (even if) when the speaker wants to express a strong conviction or opinion.  It's often used when stating rules, principles, or strong beliefs.",

Paying attention to the nuances of these similar expressions will help you use them correctly."
