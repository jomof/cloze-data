  "writeup": "たびに is an adverbial form derived from the noun 度 (do), meaning 'time' or 'occasion.'  It's used to express something that happens repeatedly, \"each time,\" \"every time,\" or \"whenever\" a particular event occurs.  It frequently follows verbs or nouns. When used after nouns, the particle の is necessary. For example,  \"毎日のように\" (mainichi no you ni) means \"almost every day,\" whereas \"毎日たびに\" (mainichi tabini) would not be used in standard Japanese.  This subtle distinction is key to understanding the nuance of たびに.  Think of it as emphasizing the repetitive *action* associated with each occurrence.  It highlights the repeated action, often implying a consequential effect.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n* While similar to ごとに (goto ni), たびに emphasizes the action associated with the repeated event more strongly.  It suggests a stronger connection between the event and its consequence.  Think 'every time *doing something*'.",
  "etymology": "The word たびに (tabini) comes from the noun 度 (do), meaning \"degree,\" \"time,\" or \"occasion.\" The suffix に (ni) transforms the noun into an adverbial form, signifying \"at each time\" or \"every time.\" The pronunciation shift to たんびに (tanbini) in casual speech highlights the colloquial nature of the expression.",
