    "etymology": "The particle 「より」 originally comes from the verb 「寄る (yoru)」, meaning \"to approach\" or \"to draw near.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate a point of origin or comparison, eventually taking on the meaning of \"from,\" \"than,\" or \"more than.\"",
    "writeup": "「より」 is an adverbial particle used to indicate a higher degree or greater extent of something. It's equivalent to \"more\" in English when making comparisons. It precedes an adjective or adverb to modify its meaning, indicating that something is to a greater degree than before or than something else. For instance, 「より面白い」 means \"more interesting,\" and 「より丁寧に」 means \"more carefully.\"",
