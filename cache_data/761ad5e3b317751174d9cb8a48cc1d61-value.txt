    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことなの」 is a combination of the noun 「こと」 (koto), which generally refers to a thing, matter, or fact, and 「なの」 (na no), a combination of the copula 「だ」 (da) in its informal 「な」 (na) form, and the explanatory particle 「の」 (no). Thus, it literally means \"it is the matter/fact that...\", adding an explanatory nuance.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「ことなの」 combines the noun 「こと」, meaning \"thing\" or \"matter\", with 「なの」, which itself is an informal form of 「なのです」. This structure is used to provide an explanation or to emphasize a point. It's similar in function to 「んです」 or 「のです」, highlighting the speaker's understanding or conclusion about something. You'll often see 「ことなの」 used after an explanation introduced by 「というのは」, which defines a term or concept.  The 「というのは」 sets up the topic, and 「ことなの」 presents the speaker's understanding of it.  In casual speech, 「というのは」 can be shortened to 「って」 or 「とは」.  Be aware that using 「ことなの？」 in questions can sound assertive or even rude in everyday conversations, implying the speaker has already drawn a conclusion and is seeking confirmation. This form is more common in dramatic contexts.",
