  "writeup": "んじゃない is a colloquial grammar pattern, primarily used in informal settings, attached to verbs to express prohibition or strong disapproval.  It's often translated as \"Don't,\" \"Mustn't,\" or \"Shouldn't have.\"  Its usage usually implies a power dynamic, with the speaker holding a higher status than the listener. While it can be used in anger, it's not inherently aggressive.  The structure combines the possessive particle の and the informal negative form of だ (じゃない). It directly attaches to the dictionary form of the verb.  A slightly more formal but still informal variation, んじゃありません, exists and is sometimes preferred when the speaker wants to express prohibition without sounding angry, for example, a parent instructing a child.  Literally, Verb + んじゃない translates to \"it's not (verb)\", which may sound unnatural in English but conveys a sense of direct instruction.  The te-form (てんじゃない) is also sometimes used.  **Important Considerations:** When used at the end of a sentence, intonation is crucial. A rising intonation turns it into a question (んじゃないか), while a falling intonation remains a prohibition.  The past tense form, んじゃなかった, expresses regret or disappointment that an action occurred, carrying a \"shouldn't have\" meaning. This nuanced understanding is critical for accurate interpretation and effective communication.",

      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "nuance": "The use of よ at the end adds emphasis and a slightly more forceful tone to the prohibition.  The phrase 「そんなこと言わないで」 sets up the prohibition."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ここを勝手に触ら**んじゃありません**よ。",
      "english": "Don't touch this without permission.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "instructional",
      "conjugation": "polite negative",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「んじゃありません」 softens the prohibition, making it suitable for a slightly more formal situation. Adding 「よ」emphasizes the warning."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "昨日、あんなに遅くまで起きてい**んじゃなかった**。",
      "english": "I shouldn't have stayed up so late yesterday.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": "past negative",
      "nuance": "The past tense 「んじゃなかった」 conveys regret over a past action. The phrase 「あんなに遅くまで起きて」 emphasizes the extent of the regrettable action."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "もっと早く来れ**んじゃんかった**の？",
      "english": "Shouldn't you have come earlier?",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "interrogative",
      "conjugation": "past negative",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The use of の at the end of 「んじゃんかった」turns it into a softer question implying disapproval.  The use of 「もっと早く来れ」 in a question directed to a younger person by an older one is common and implies a mild reprimand."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "私を無視する**んじゃない**わよ！",
      "english": "Don't ignore me!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "nuance": "The use of わよ is a common female speech particle that adds emphasis and a slightly flirty tone. The directness of 「私を無視する」 combined with 「んじゃない」 creates a playful yet assertive statement.  A male speaker would not likely use 「わよ」."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "こんなに素敵なあなたと出会えたなんて、もっと早く知り合うべきじゃ**なかった**の？",
      "english": "Meeting someone as wonderful as you, shouldn't we have met sooner?",
      "register": "shitashii kuchō",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "conjugation": "past negative",
      "nuance": "The intimate register 「もっと早く知り合うべきじゃなかったの？」 uses the past tense to create a romantic and suggestive tone.  The use of 「こんなに素敵なあなた」 is a common compliment in this situation. The question form makes it flirty, and the use of の is appropriate for an intimate setting."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that context and intonation are crucial when interpreting んじゃない. Pay close attention to the speaker's tone and the overall situation.  While generally informal, the politeness level can be adjusted by using the polite form んじゃありません.",
  "etymology": "The grammar point is a contraction of the phrase '〜ではない' (de wa nai), meaning 'it is not ~'. The 'ん' is a nasal sound, and 'じゃ' is a casual contraction of 'でわ'. The final 'い' is dropped in casual speech."
