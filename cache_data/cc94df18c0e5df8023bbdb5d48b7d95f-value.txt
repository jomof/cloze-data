    "etymology": "The particle 「ばかり」 itself means \"only\" or \"nothing but.\" The 「だ」is the plain form of the copula, indicating a statement or assertion. The combination implies a sense of something continuously trending in a single direction.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ばかりだ」 combines the adverbial particle 「ばかり」, meaning \"only\", with the copula 「だ」. It is used to express that something is continuously happening, is increasingly trending in one direction, or consists of only one thing. It is commonly used with verbs describing some form of change (increasing/decreasing, strengthening/weakening, improving/worsening, accelerating/decelerating, etc.). The negative form of the verb implies only a bad thing is happening.\n\n*Important Considerations*\n\n*   While often used with negative trends, 「ばかりだ」 can also describe positive changes. The key is the sense of continuous progression.\n*   Variants like 「ばっかり」, 「ばっか」, 「ばかし」, and 「ばっかし」 are common in casual speech.",
