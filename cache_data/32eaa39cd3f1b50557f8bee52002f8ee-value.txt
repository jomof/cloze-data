  "writeup": "The conjunction particle て, or the case marking particle で, are often used to highlight how something is being 'used'.  The thing being used doesn't necessarily need to be a tool; it can also be a circumstance or situation. In these cases, '(A)で(B)' translates as 'with/by means of (A), (B)'.  A fun fact: With て (and で), the nuance is quite often that '(A) allowed/led to (B)'. This might be a simple sequence of events or a direct result of using a tool or situation. The nuance being highlighted always depends on the (B) phrase. Therefore, it's crucial to always read the (B) clause before determining the speaker's intended meaning.",
  "etymology": "The particles て and で both derive from the classical Japanese demonstrative pronoun て (pronounced as 'te' in modern Japanese).  Over time, て evolved into a versatile conjunction marker indicating sequential actions or means, while で specialized into a case marker indicating location, manner, or instrument.",
