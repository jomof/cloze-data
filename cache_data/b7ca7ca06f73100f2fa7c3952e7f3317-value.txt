    "etymology": "The verb 「あげる」originally meant \"to raise\" or \"to lift up.\" The \"giving\" meaning evolved from the idea of offering something to someone of equal or lower status, similar to \"offering up\" in English. It implies a sense of providing or bestowing something.",
    "writeup": "「あげる」is a verb with many uses in Japanese. Its original meaning is \"to raise,\" but it is also used as a polite way of saying \"to give.\" In this way, it can be thought of as similar to \"to offer up\" in English. In polite speech, the giver will be marked with 「は」 or 「が」, while the recipient will be marked with 「に」. As usual, the object that is being given will be marked with 「を」. From the examples, we can see that the order of \"giver,\" \"recipient,\" and \"object\" does not matter, as long as the correct particles are used.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「あげる」should not be used when giving something to someone of higher status or when lowering oneself to elevate another. Honorific language or humble speech uses different verbs.\n*   Although 「あげる」is considered polite speech, it is generally the most natural way of saying \"to give.\" 「やる」is the casual equivalent of 「あげる」, but because 「やる」can sound a little rough, 「あげる」became the standard.",
