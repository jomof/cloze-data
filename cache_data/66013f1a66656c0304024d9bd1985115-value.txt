    "etymology": "The past tense of う-verbs is formed by changing the final kana of the dictionary form and adding 「た」 (casual) or 「ました」 (polite). The specific kana change depends on the final sound of the verb's dictionary form, reflecting the historical sound changes in the Japanese language.",
    "writeup": "To form the past tense of う-verbs (also known as Godan verbs) in Japanese, you need to change the last kana of the verb's dictionary form before adding 「た」 (casual) or 「ました」 (polite). The specific kana change depends on the verb's ending. For the casual past form, the changes involve replacing the final 「う」 sound with either 「った」, 「いた」, 「いだ」, 「んだ」, or 「した」, depending on the last kana of the verb. For example:\n\n*   Verbs ending in 「う」, 「つ」, or 「る」 change to 「った」\n*   Verbs ending in 「く」 change to 「いた」\n*   Verbs ending in 「ぐ」 change to 「いだ」\n*   Verbs ending in 「む」, 「ぶ」, or 「ぬ」 change to 「んだ」\n*   Verbs ending in 「す」 change to 「した」\n\nFor the polite past form, the final 「う」 sound is changed to an 「い」 sound (e.g., 「う」 to 「い」, 「く」 to 「き」) before adding 「ました」.",
