  "writeup": "This grammar point, \"れる・られる + ままに,\" indicates actions performed in accordance with instructions or orders.  It's a nuanced structure that combines the passive form of verbs (れる/られる) with まま (\"as is\") and the particle に (\"in\"). The resulting meaning conveys doing something \"as told\" or \"as ordered.\"  This construction typically involves verbs describing communication, like ordering, asking, or instructing.  Think of it as 'doing something in the state of being told to do it.' The action following ままに describes the compliance with the initial instruction. While が can be inserted between られる and ままに, implying a sense of 'but' or 'although',  this is uncommon in modern Japanese. This isn't to contradict the instruction, but to simply show one's following of the instruction.  This construction tends to be formal and more commonly used in written Japanese.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "私は先輩に**言われるままに**、資料をコピーした。",
      "english": "I copied the documents as my senior told me to.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「言われるままに」, indicating a passive following of instructions from a senior colleague. This is appropriate in a professional setting, and implies a degree of deference to authority. The lack of any overt resistance to the order is subtle but important."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "警察の**聞かれるままに**、全てを話した。",
      "english": "I told them everything as the police asked me to.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「聞かれるままに」suggests a situation where the speaker felt compelled to comply with the police's questioning, emphasizing a lack of choice. The semi-formal register is suitable given the setting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼に**誘われるままに**、初めてのデートをした。",
      "english": "I went on a first date as he invited me.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register and the setting of a first date suits the sentence. 「誘われるままに」shows a sense of being led, almost passively, into the date— perhaps an element of surprise, excitement, or even nervousness."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の**言われるままに**、高級レストランで食事をした。まるで夢みたいだった。",
      "english": "I ate at an upscale restaurant as he told me to. It was like a dream.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence structure is casual.  The phrase 「言われるままに」suggests a playful, almost subservient attitude, which, in a flirty context, can be endearing.  The addition of 「まるで夢みたいだった」further enhances the romantic and slightly suggestive tone."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "上司に**命じられるままに**、休日出勤をした。",
      "english": "I worked overtime on my day off as ordered by my boss.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal register reflects the professional setting and hierarchical relationship. 「命じられるままに」suggests obedience to a superior, even if it's an unwelcome order."

  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "While the examples primarily showcase the use of  れる/られる in its plain form,  remember that other conjugated forms can be used depending on the context, maintaining the core meaning of compliance. For instance, the polite form  (～られます) would be used in more polite situations.",
  "false_friends": [
    {
      "term": "Verb［れる・られる］",
      "meaning": "Was done to ~ by ~, Done without consent, Done to one's dismay",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike れる・られる + ままに, which emphasizes compliance with an order, the passive form alone can simply indicate something was done to someone, without suggesting consent or willing compliance."
    },
    {
      "term": "ままに (as desired)",
      "meaning": "As is, While remaining, Left in a state",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While ままに can express a state of being,  れる・られる + ままに adds the crucial element of action taken in response to instruction."
    },
    {
      "term": "にしたがって",
      "meaning": "As, Following, As then, According to, In accordance with",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "にしたがって is a more direct and less passive way of expressing accordance with instructions.  It lacks the subtle nuance of reluctant but compliant action often found in れる・られる + ままに."
    },
    {
      "term": "に沿って",
      "meaning": "Along, In accordance with, In line with",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "に沿って suggests following a guideline or plan, but doesn't carry the implied sense of being explicitly told to perform an action."
    },
    {
      "term": "とおり",
      "meaning": "In that way, Exactly, Precisely, Just as",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "とおり  is a more concise and less passive way of expressing exact replication. It lacks the passive voice and implied pressure of being told what to do."
    },
    {
      "term": "ように",
      "meaning": "So that, In order to, In such a way that",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "ように expresses intention or purpose.  It indicates the speaker’s motivation, not that they acted solely due to an instruction received."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference lies in the level of agency and passivity.  れる・られる + ままに specifically emphasizes actions performed due to direct instruction, often implying a degree of passivity or lack of choice.  Other similar expressions focus more on adherence to rules, guidelines, or a general plan, rather than direct orders."
