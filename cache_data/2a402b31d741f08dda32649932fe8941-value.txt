  "writeup": "が早いか is a Japanese expression used to describe two consecutive actions, where the second action follows the first **immediately and unexpectedly**.  It combines the particle が, the i-adjective 早い (hayai, 'fast', 'quick', 'early'), and the adverbial particle か.  While a literal translation might be '(A), or possibly sooner, (B)', its meaning is closer to 'no sooner than (A), (B)' or 'the instant that (A), (B)'. The か emphasizes the instantaneous nature of (B) following (A), implying that (A) wasn't fully completed before (B) began.  This grammatical pattern is formal and typically follows verbs in their dictionary or past tense forms. The verb in the second clause (B) is always in the past tense. Action (A) usually involves a momentary or clearly defined completion, while action (B) is often unexpected and volitional—an intentional act.  For actions without a clear endpoint, 終わる (owaru, 'to finish') is frequently added to the stem of the first verb to clearly denote its completion.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n* Because が早いか always describes past events, it cannot express future wishes or intentions. \n* It doesn't emphasize the speaker's actions; it's more of a descriptive observation of events.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of が早いか is straightforward. It's a combination of existing grammatical elements. が is a nominative particle, 早い is an i-adjective meaning 'fast' or 'quick', and か is an adverbial particle indicating a possibility or immediacy.  The overall structure leverages existing grammatical function to create a specific nuance of immediacy and unexpectedness that isn't easily captured by other simpler expressions.",

  "post_example_writeup": "While が早いか primarily describes past events, the immediacy it conveys can create a dramatic effect in storytelling and even add intensity to descriptions of first encounters or romantic moments. The choice of verb conjugations will slightly shift the formality, but even in casual settings, maintaining the past-tense structure in the second clause is crucial for conveying this unique grammatical expression.",
