  "writeup": "もちろん (mochiron), meaning 'of course' or 'naturally,' is often paired with は (wa), the topic-marking particle, to create the phrase はもちろん (wa mochiron).  This construction elegantly conveys the idea of something being self-evident, while simultaneously introducing an additional point. The は (wa) sets the stage by highlighting the obvious fact (A), and もちろん (mochiron) emphasizes its inherent truth. The sentence then proceeds to introduce another aspect (B), often related to (A) in some way.  The overall effect is similar to English expressions like \"not only (A), but also (B)\", \"let alone (A), (B)\", or \"not to mention (A), (B)\".  The nuance often highlights (B) as a further point worthy of consideration, even in light of the obviousness of (A). Importantly, も (mo) will usually appear later in the sentence, linking (A) and (B) together. While similar to だけでなく (dakedeniwa), はもちろん is considerably more formal and may sound stiff in casual settings unless used for strong emphasis.",
  "etymology": "もちろん (mochiron) originates from the combination of も (mo), meaning 'also' or 'even,' and 勿論 (mochiron), a Sino-Japanese word composed of 勿 (moku) meaning 'not' and 倫 (ron) meaning 'reason' or 'principle'.  Ironically, the initial 'not' has been lost over time, leaving only a sense of natural, inevitable consequence or agreement.",

If you need to emphasize the obviousness of one point before adding a further related point, はもちろん is excellent. If a more casual register is preferable, consider だけでなく or ばかりでなく.  For listing additional points or broadening a statement's scope, 加えて, に限らず, or はじめ are better choices.  Consider the overall context to make the most effective choice."
