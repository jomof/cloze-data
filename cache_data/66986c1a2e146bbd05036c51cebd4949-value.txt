  "writeup": "The phrase なぜなら〜から is a common way to express cause and effect in Japanese.  It translates to \"Because...that's why...\" or \"The reason is...because...\" in English.  It's more emphatic than simply using から or ので alone, drawing more attention to the reason.  なぜなら itself is a conjunction, a combination of なぜ ('why') and the hypothetical form of だ (なら). Literally, it's similar to 'Why is A so? Because of B.'  While this literal translation sounds somewhat formal in English, it's quite natural in Japanese. To use it, state the fact or key information first, followed by なぜなら and the reason, concluding with から.  This structure allows for clear emphasis on the cause.  This construction is useful for situations where you want to explicitly state the reason for a preceding event or statement, making it more persuasive and clear.",
  "etymology": "なぜなら is a combination of なぜ (naze, why) and なら (nara, if).  なら is the conditional form of だ (da, to be).  The combination creates a nuanced causal structure emphasizing the reason following it. から (kara) is a particle indicating the source or reason.",
