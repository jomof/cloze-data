    "etymology": "しかない is a combination of 「しか」 (shika), an adverbial particle indicating limitation, and 「ない」 (nai), the negative form of 「ある」 (aru, to exist). Thus, it literally means 'only exists not,' implying that nothing else is possible.",
    "writeup": "しかない is a common expression used with verbs to indicate having \"no choice but\" to do something or that something is the \"only\" option. It is a combination of 「しか」, the adverbial particle, and the い-adjective 「ない」. This structure may be translated as \"to have no choice but (A)\" or \"there is only (A).\" しかない emphasizes that nothing apart from (A) is possible. To use しかない, simply attach it directly to the dictionary form of the verb. Unlike 「だけ」 (dake), which implies that one particular option was chosen (out of several), 「しかない」 always insinuates that (A) is the only option and therefore sounds stronger than 「だけ」. Because only one option exists, it is often assumed that circumstances resulted in (A) being all that can be done.\n\n**Important Note:**\nIn casual language, such as in manga or anime, しかない is sometimes shortened to 「っきゃない」. This abbreviation is less common in formal settings.",
