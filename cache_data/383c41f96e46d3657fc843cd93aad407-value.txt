  "writeup": "The grammar point 至って・に至り (itamatte/itamatari) is an advanced particle phrase used to express a point in time or a situation that marks a crucial turning point, often leading to a significant consequence.  It translates roughly as \"when it came to,\" \"only when,\" \"only after,\" or \"going so far as to.\"  The core verb 至る (itaru) means \"to reach,\" \"to arrive at,\" or \"to amount to.\"  The particle に emphasizes the point at which the action or state described before 至って/に至り occurs.  This phrase often highlights the criticality or severity of the preceding event leading to the consequence. It's frequently used in contexts where a situation has escalated to a point where action becomes necessary or inevitable, or where a realization dawns upon the speaker only after a certain threshold is passed.  The formal conjunctive form 至り (itamatari) is sometimes used as an alternative to the more common て-form 至って (itamatte).",
  "etymology": "至る (itaru) originates from the ancient Chinese word 至 (zhì), meaning \"to arrive\" or \"to reach.\"  The combination with the particle に and the connective て-form emphasizes the culminating point or the limit that triggers a reaction or consequence. The formal conjunctive form 至り retains this historical nuance, suggesting a more polished or refined tone compared to the more common て-form.",
