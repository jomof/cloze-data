  "writeup": "全く～ない (mattaku ~ nai) is an emphatic way of saying 'not at all.'  It combines the adverb まったく (mattaku; completely, entirely) with the negative form of a verb or adjective. The kanji 全く (mattaku) literally means 'completely,' emphasizing the total absence of something.  This expression is versatile and commonly used in various registers, from casual conversation to more formal settings.  However, while versatile, it does carry a slightly more serious tone than some alternatives.  We'll explore its nuances and appropriate usage through examples.",
  "etymology": "The core of this grammar point, まったく (mattaku), originates from the kanji 全く (zen-zuku), meaning 'entirely' or 'completely.'  The 'zen' component indicates 'whole' or 'all,' and 'zuku' adds an intensifying nuance. Over time, the pronunciation shifted to まったく, but the sense of complete negation remains.",

      "japanese": "この犬は全く吠えない。",
      "english": "This dog doesn't bark at all.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence uses the plain negative form of the verb. 「全く吠えない」 (mattaku hoenai) directly conveys the complete absence of barking."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の説明は全く理解できなかった。",
      "english": "I couldn't understand his explanation at all.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This uses the past tense negative of the verb 「理解する」(rikkai suru), showing that the speaker completely failed to understand. 「全く理解できなかった」(mattaku rikai dekina-katta) underscores the utter lack of comprehension."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "その映画は全く面白くなかった。",
      "english": "That movie wasn't interesting at all.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "Here, the negative form of the adjective 「面白い」(omoshiroi) is used with まったく (mattaku). 「全く面白くなかった」(mattaku omoshiroku nakatta) strongly asserts the complete lack of interest."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "全く疲れていないよ。",
      "english": "I'm not tired at all.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence is casual due to the use of 「よ」(yo), and the omission of です (desu). 「全く疲れていないよ」(mattaku tsukarete inai yo) is a slightly more casual form, used in a friendly context between a female and male speaking informally to each other.  The  「よ」 (yo) is a common feminine sentence-ending particle."

    {
      "japanese": "先生、全く分かりません！",
      "english": "Teacher, I don't understand at all!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "interrogative",
      "speaker_age": "younger",
      "listener_age": "older",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The exclamation point and the direct address \"先生\" (sensei) showcase the casual and slightly informal tone, and common among young people interacting with teachers. The use of 「ません」(masen) is a polite negative form suitable for the teacher-student setting but the overall tone remains casual for a younger person speaking with a teacher they feel comfortable with. 「全く分かりません！」(mattaku wakarimasen!) emphasizes the complete lack of understanding."

    {
      "japanese": "あなたの笑顔は、全く私の心を奪います。",
      "english": "Your smile completely steals my heart.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite verb form 「奪います」(ubaima-su) elevates the register to be more formal and respectful, appropriate for a slightly more formal, or early-stage romantic interaction between a younger man and a woman. 「全く私の心を奪います」(mattaku watashi no kokoro o ubaimasu) expresses a strong feeling with intense emotion."
    },
        {
      "japanese": "今日のプレゼンテーションは全く成功ではありませんでした。",
      "english": "Today's presentation was not a success at all.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of the formal negative past tense 「ではありませんでした」(de wa arimasendeshita) and the more formal topic marker 「は」(wa) makes this sentence very formal.  This style is suitable for discussing professional matters in a serious tone.  「全く成功ではありませんでした」(mattaku seikō de wa arimasendeshita) is very formal, suitable for a professional context or even a formal apology."

  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the intensity of 'not at all' is consistently conveyed, regardless of the sentence structure or register.  Mastering the subtle shifts in formality will make your Japanese communication more nuanced and effective.",

      "term": "全然～ない",
      "meaning": "(Not) at all",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike まったく～ない, which implies a more serious or formal tone, 全然～ない is more common in casual speech and slightly less intense."

      "meaning": "Not even a little",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these expressions share the core meaning of 'not at all,' the choice depends on the context and desired level of formality.  Generally, まったく～ない sits between 全然～ない (more casual) and 少しも～ない (more emphatic) on the intensity scale. Consider the overall tone of your communication to select the most appropriate expression."
