    "etymology": "The grammar point 「が早いか」combines the particle 「が」, the adjective 「早い」 (hayai, meaning 'early' or 'fast'), and the question particle 「か」. The 「早い」indicates the immediacy, while 「が」marks the preceding verb, and 「か」adds a nuance of 'or even sooner?', emphasizing the almost simultaneous nature of the two actions.",
    "writeup": "「が早いか」is a formal Japanese expression used to describe two actions happening in quick succession. It conveys a sense of immediacy, similar to \"as soon as\" or \"no sooner than.\" The structure is V(dictionary form) が早いか, V(past form).  The verb in the clause following 「が早いか」 is typically in the past tense. The action described by the first verb concludes swiftly, and the second action follows almost instantly.  It is more commonly used with the non-past (dictionary) form of the verb. This grammar point tends to be used in formal speech and writing.",
