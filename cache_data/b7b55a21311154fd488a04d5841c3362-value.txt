  "writeup": "The adverb ずっと, in addition to its common usage meaning \"always\" or \"continuously,\" can also express the idea that one thing is significantly greater or more than another—\"by far\" or \"way more.\"  In this comparative sense, ずっと typically precedes the comparative element within the sentence, setting the stage for the comparison that follows.  A fascinating aspect is that despite the apparent difference in meaning between  \"always\" and \"by far,\" the core meaning remains consistent.  In both instances, ずっと emphasizes an extensive duration or magnitude, whether temporal or qualitative.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of ずっと is rooted in its basic meaning of 'throughout,' or 'all the way through.'  It derives from a combination of components that highlight extended time or distance.  This foundational meaning naturally extends to its comparative usage, where the 'length' of the superiority is highlighted. The nuance of 'by far' emerges from this inherent emphasis on extent.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "さっき見た鳥より**ずっと**大きかったよ！",
      "english": "It was much bigger than the bird we saw earlier!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of よ！ at the end makes this a casual and expressive statement, appropriate for speaking to a friend or someone close.  The 「大きかった」 indicates a past event that can be easily expressed in past tense."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "それより**ずっと**昔だよ。",
      "english": "That happened way before that.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This sentence, using 「昔」, is another casual example emphasizing the significant time difference. The simple structure is perfect for a conversational setting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "運動していなかったから、体が**ずっと**動かない。",
      "english": "Because I haven't exercised, my body feels stiff all the time.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "This shows ずっと used more like \"all the time\" or \"constantly.\" The casual nature is evident in the simple sentence structure and omission of polite sentence endings."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "そんな変な奴より、こっちの方が**ずっと**すごいよ！",
      "english": "This one is way cooler than that weirdo!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "humorous",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The exclamation 「よ！」 again denotes casual speech.  The comparative 「より」 leads to the emphasis on the significant difference between \"this\" and \"that weirdo.\"  The use of 「すごい」 which implies something exceptionally good adds to the casual and informal tone."

      "japanese": "この車は私のより**ずっと**よく見える。",
      "english": "This car looks way better than mine.",

      "setting": "casual",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual nature is demonstrated through the lack of sentence-ending particles and the directness of the comparison. The 「見える」 (to look) is used to enhance the expressive quality of the comparison."

      "japanese": "コンピュータは以前に比べて**ずっと**使いやすいようになった。",
      "english": "Computers have become much more user-friendly than before.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,

      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「君」 (kimi) instead of 「あなた」 (anata) is very intimate and commonly used between close friends or lovers.  The implication is romantic. The sentence ending 「よ」 adds an emotional touch, appropriate for a confession."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたの笑顔は、他の誰よりも**ずっと**美しいよ。",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the context.  If the sentence describes something happening continuously, use ずっと ①.  If comparing two things where one is significantly greater than the other, use ずっと ②.  The grammatical structure surrounding ずっと will also often provide a clear indicator of its intended meaning."
