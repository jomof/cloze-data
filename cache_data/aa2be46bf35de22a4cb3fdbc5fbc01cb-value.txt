  "writeup": "すら is an adverbial particle in Japanese that translates as 'even'.  The key difference between すら and も is that すら tends to present a far more extreme example to which a specific rule applies, thereby implying it also applies to all less extreme examples.  In most cases, すら will be used with a negative nuance. Because すら is an adverbial particle, it appears directly after nouns, or nouns followed by case-marking particles.  すら may also be followed by も for added emphasis.  \n\n**Caution:** すら and さえ are similar in strength, but すら is more formal and can't be used in the さえ～ば construction.  すら also usually refers to the most extreme example in a large group, whereas さえ emphasizes a specific individual.\n\n**Fun Fact:** は, も, さえ, and すら are adverbial particles sharing a linear relationship regarding their usage intensity. This relates to how well (A) fits into a group:\n\n* (A) は – (A) is as expected, nothing surprising.\n* (A) も – (A) also fits the category of the main topic (は), but may or may not be surprising.\n* (A) さえ – (A) also fits, but is quite surprising individually.\n* (A) すら – (A) also fits, but is the most extreme example, implying anything less extreme also applies.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of すら is complex and not definitively settled, but it likely developed from a combination of older particles and grammatical structures expressing emphasis and extremity.  Further research into classical Japanese would be needed to trace the precise origins.",
