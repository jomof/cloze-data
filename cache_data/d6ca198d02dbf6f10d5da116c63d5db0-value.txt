  "etymology": "This expression combines the negative form of a verb (ない), the particle で, the particle は, and the negative potential form of the verb いる (いられない).  The core meaning comes from the inability to 'be without' doing the action, thus expressing an irresistible urge or compulsion.",
  "writeup": "The expression ないではいられない conveys the feeling of being unable to resist or help doing something.  It's a nuanced structure, combining the negative verb form with で, は, and the negative potential of いる, literally translating to something like 'cannot be without doing.' This doesn't simply mean 'I want to do it,' but rather highlights the speaker's lack of control; they *must* do it, driven by a strong feeling or impulse.  This impulse can stem from various sources, including strong desires, compelling emotions, or even a sense of obligation or responsibility.  The structure is versatile, adaptable to many situations and registers, although generally avoids overly formal settings.",

    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, carefully consider the core reason for the action.  If it's an irresistible urge or strong emotion, ないではいられない is appropriate. If it's due to a lack of time or other constraints, consider てはいられない.  ずにはいられない introduces a slight nuance of avoiding something before committing to an action."
