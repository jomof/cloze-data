  "writeup": "折角 (せっかく) is an idiomatic adverb often used to express doing something 'with trouble,' 'at great pains,' or to indicate a 'rare/long-awaited occasion.'  As an adverb often modifying the sentence's meaning, it typically appears at the beginning. When  折角 nominates a long-awaited event, it precedes the event, usually separated only by the case-marking particle の.  \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n* The nuance subtly shifts depending on context. It can express regret, appreciation, or simply a statement of fact.\n* While grammatically versatile, its placement often impacts the overall meaning.\n\n**Etymology:** There are several theories regarding 折角's origin. A common one suggests it's an abbreviation of 頭巾の角を折る ('to fold the horn (tail) of a hood'), an action a Confucian scholar supposedly did to protect his hood from rain. This act was imitated, and 折角 then became an idiom signifying 'intentionally' or 'going out of one's way.'",
