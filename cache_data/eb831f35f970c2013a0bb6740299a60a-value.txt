    "etymology": "The term 「および」 originates from the verb 「及ぶ(およぶ)」, meaning \"to reach,\" \"to extend to,\" or \"to be up to.\" It transitioned from being a verb form to a conjunction, retaining the sense of one thing extending to include another.",
    "writeup": "「および」 functions as a formal conjunction, equivalent to \"and\" or \"as well as.\" It originates from the verb 「及ぶ(およぶ)」, meaning \"to reach\" or \"to extend to.\" While often simply translated as \"and,\" 「および」 carries a nuance of extension or inclusion, reflecting its verbal root. It is predominantly used in formal contexts such as documents, articles, and official announcements, rather than everyday conversation. It is typically used at the beginning of the second clause in a sentence, or immediately after a noun that something is being added to.",
