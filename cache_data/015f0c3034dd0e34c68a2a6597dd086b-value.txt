    },
    "etymology": "であれ is derived from the conjunctive form (で) of the copula だ (a shortened form of である), combined with the imperative form (あれ) of the verb ある. This creates a sense of \"even if it is...\" or \"no matter what it is...\"",
    "writeup": "であれ is a formal expression similar to であっても, expressing the idea of concession or disregard. It is often translated as \"even if\" or \"no matter\". It emphasizes that whatever condition precedes it, the result remains the same. This grammar point is considered stiff 「硬い」 and is often found in formal writing or speech. It's frequently used with words like どんな (donna - what kind of) or たとえ (tatoe - even if) to introduce a hypothetical or assumed condition. The more literal nuance suggests, \"so what if it is (A), (B) still won't be affected.\" It expresses a strong will or conviction, often found in sentences where the speaker is stating their opinion or resolution.",
