    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にしては」 is composed of に (particle indicating location or time), して (the te-form of する, meaning 'to do'), and は (the topic marker particle).  The combination suggests a sense of setting a basis or context 「に」 and then highlighting something that exists or happens 「して」 within that context 「は」, leading to the meaning of 'considering' or 'for'.",
    "writeup": "Similar to として, にして highlights a certain aspect or status of something, but unlike として, which often implies a role or identity, にして focuses on that aspect as a basis for comparison or unexpectedness.  The particle に indicates a point of reference or a state, and して, the te-form of する, connects that state to the subsequent clause. The topic marker は signals that the preceding phrase is the focus of the sentence. Therefore, にしては translates to something like \"considering the state of...\" or \"even for...\". It often expresses a sense of surprise or a deviation from what might be expected given the initial condition.  You can think of it as setting a certain standard and then commenting on how something meets or doesn't quite meet that standard.",
