    "etymology": "だけ comes from the verb 「丈(た)つ」, meaning 'to measure'. It implies a limit or extent. は is the topic marker particle.",
    "writeup": "だけは is a grammar pattern that includes the particle だけ, meaning \"just\" or \"only.\" In this structure, だけ pairs with は, and presents a specific verb as the topic to indicate that it is being done \"as much as one can.\" The same verb is often repeated both before and after だけは, with the one coming second usually appearing in its past-tense or ている form.\n\nFor example, if the target verb was 食べる (taberu, \"to eat\"), the literal translation of something like 食べるだけは食べた (taberu dake wa tabeta) would be \"I ate just what I could eat\".\n\nBecause this pattern frequently discusses possibilities, it is also very common for the first verb to be in the potential れる or られる form.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nIt is also relatively common to see する (suru, \"to do\") omitted following the first verb, and only being used after だけは. In this kind of pattern, the target verb itself will not usually be repeated after だけは.",
