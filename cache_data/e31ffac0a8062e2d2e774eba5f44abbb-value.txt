    "etymology": "たい comes from the verb 「欲(ほ)しい」 (hoshii), which means \"to want (something).\" たい can be seen as the verbified form of the adjective 「欲(ほ)しい」, but only for actions, not things. The earliest usages of forms similar to たい can be found in texts from the Heian period (794-1185).",
    "writeup": "たい is an auxiliary adjective that expresses a desire to do something. To use たい, attach it to the ます-stem (same conjugation base form of a verb that ます would be attached to). For example, 「食べたい」(tabetai) means \"want to eat\" (食べます → 食べ + たい). When using たい, the thing that is 'wanted' can be marked with either を or が. The nuance is that something marked with が is considered to be more strongly desired. たい conjugates like an い-adjective, meaning that negative, past, or past-negative forms can be used. たい is generally used only for expressing what 'you' want, or asking questions about what other people want. It's not typically used to guess what someone else might want, unless asking them directly.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   Avoid using たい to tell others you want them to do something; use 〜てほしい instead.\n*   〜ませんか is more natural for invitations than たい.",
