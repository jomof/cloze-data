    "writeup": "**てたまらない** combines the て-form (**te-form**) with **たまらない (tamaranai)**, the negative form of the verb **堪る (tamaru)**, meaning \"to bear\", \"to endure\", or \"to tolerate\".  It expresses a feeling or desire that is **unbearable** or **extreme**.

    The meaning shifts slightly depending on what precedes it:

    *   When attached to the **たい (tai)** form of a verb, it means **\"can't help but want to do something\"**. The literal sense is that the desire is so strong you can't bear it.
    *   When attached to **い-adjectives**, the **い** changes to **くて (kute)**, and it means **\"extremely (adjective)\"**.  The feeling is so intense you can't bear it.
    *   When attached to **な-adjectives**, **で (de)** is used, and it means **\"extremely (adjective)\"**.

    Essentially, **てたまらない** highlights the intensity of a feeling or desire.",
