  "writeup": "The adverb 遂に (tsuini) translates to \"finally\" or \"at last.\"  It typically appears at the beginning of a sentence, emphasizing the culmination of a prolonged period or series of events. While often used interchangeably with とうとう (tōtō), 遂に carries a slightly more formal tone.  The kanji 遂 (sui) itself implies the completion of a task or process, often one requiring considerable time or effort. Therefore, 遂に is best suited for situations where the event's achievement marks the end of a significant undertaking, and isn't ideally used for quick or effortless tasks.  This nuance is crucial for natural and appropriate usage.",
  "etymology": "遂に (tsuini) combines the kanji 遂 (sui), meaning \"to accomplish\" or \"to complete,\" and に (ni), a particle indicating time or circumstance.  The meaning reflects the completion of a lengthy or challenging process, creating the sense of \"finally\" or \"at last.\"",
