    "etymology": "けど evolved from けれども, which itself is a conjunction formed from the verb stem of 蹴る (keru, \"to kick\") + the conjunctive particle ども (domo). The original nuance involved something like \"even if you kick it away,\" implying concession. だけど is simply けど with the addition of だ, typically used to connect to nouns and な-adjectives.",
    "writeup": "けど is a common conjunctive particle in Japanese, connecting two parts of a sentence (A and B). It's similar to が, indicating 'while thinking about (A), (B),' often translating to \"but\" or \"however\" in English. As だ is needed after nouns and な-adjectives, you'll see だけど used in those cases.\n\nけど is a casual version of けれども, with variations ranging from casual to formal:\n\nCasual: けど < けども < けれど < けれども < が: Formal\n\nImportant:  The phrase after けど can be omitted if it's obvious or the speaker prefers not to state it directly.",
