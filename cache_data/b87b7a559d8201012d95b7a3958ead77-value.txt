  "writeup": "ようにいう is an expression combining the auxiliary verb ようだ with the u-verb 言う.  This indicates something is being said in a way that instigates action. Since ようだ is linked to 言う, it takes its adverbial form, ように.  As ようにいう means 'to be said in the way of (A) being done,' it's translated as 'to tell,' 'to request,' or 'to order.'  For requesting, 頼む may substitute for 言う; for ordering, 命じる works.  言う is the most versatile, implying either 'to order' or 'to request' depending on context and tone.  The nuance lies in the *way* something is said, emphasizing the desired outcome.",
