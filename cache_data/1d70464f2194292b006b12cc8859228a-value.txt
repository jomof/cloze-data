  "writeup": "なさい is the imperative form of なさる, an honorific verb highlighting respect for another's actions (never the speaker's).  Despite its respectful nature, it's a command, unsuitable for superiors.  Therefore, なさい is most often used with peers or inferiors, like children.  To use it, attach it to the masu stem of any verb.  It can shorten to な, a more casual form primarily used with peers.  Caution:  Avoid confusing な (the particle) with な (the shortened なさい).  な (meaning 'don't') uses the dictionary form, while な (meaning 'please do') uses the masu stem.",
  "etymology": "The word なさい comes from the verb なさる (nasaru), an honorific form of する (suru, to do).  The -sai ending indicates a polite command or suggestion.",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to distinguishing なさい from similar expressions lies in understanding the nuance of command versus request, polite versus casual, and honorific versus non-honorific speech.  Pay close attention to the verb conjugation and the sentence's overall context to select the most appropriate expression."
