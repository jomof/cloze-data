    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed by combining the volitional form of a verb (よう) with the negative volitional form (まい), joined by the particle が. The volitional form indicates intent or willingness, while the negative volitional indicates the opposite. Together, they create a structure that covers both possibilities.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「ようが〜まいが」 combines the positive and negative volitional forms of a verb to express that **regardless of whether something happens or not**, the result will be the same. It's an emphatic way of saying \"whether or not (A), (B) will happen.\" The particle が is used after both the positive and negative volitional forms.\n\nWhile commonly used with verbs, this pattern can also be applied to other auxiliary verbs like だ, as well as い-adjectives (using the かろう form). When used with nouns, な-adjectives, and い-adjectives, an antonym is typically used instead of the negative volitional まい. This grammar pattern often indicates the speaker's strong will or opinion.",
