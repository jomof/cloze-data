It implies that there are different opinions or perspectives surrounding the issue. It is often used in formal writing and speech, such as news reports, academic papers, and business presentations. The grammar point indicates something is a central topic of attention and it is usually followed by a clause that explains what happens or exists around that topic. 「をめぐって」 functions as an adverbial phrase, while 「をめぐる」 modifies a noun directly.",
