    "writeup": "The adverb 「やはり」 is used to express that something is as expected or anticipated, based on past experience, comparison, or common sense. It conveys a sense of \"after all,\" \"still,\" or \"also.\"  It is a **speaker-oriented** adverb, relying on the speaker's subjective viewpoint. Using it appropriately can make your Japanese sound natural, but overuse can make your discourse sound too subjective.\n\n*   **Key Usage:**  「やはり」 often appears at the beginning of a sentence or clause.  It can also be used mid-sentence, but avoid overusing it in every sentence.",
