    "etymology": "からして is derived from the particle から (from) and the て-form of the verb する (to do). The literal sense is \"starting from\" or \"based on\", indicating that a judgment or conclusion is drawn from the preceding noun.",
    "writeup": "からして is a combination of the conjunction particle から \"from\", and the て-form of する, \"to do\". It is used to express a partially objective opinion about something. This often comes across as \"judging from\" or \"based on\". The literal meaning is \"going from (A), (B)\". This highlights that (A) is the available information or method to make an assessment. Because からして is partially objective, it means the speaker doesn't have full information and is making a guess based on what seems true. Thus, からして sentences often have the nuance of \"from the available information about (A), (B) is likely the whole picture.\"",
