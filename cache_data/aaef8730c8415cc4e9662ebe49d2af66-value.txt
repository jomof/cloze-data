    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にかこつけて」 is derived from 「託ける (kakotsukeru)」, which means \"to use as a pretext\" or \"to make an excuse\". The 「に」 indicates the reason or basis for the action. So, literally, it means \"attaching to\" or \"relying on\" something as an excuse.",
    "writeup": "「にかこつけて」 is used to express that someone is doing something under a false pretense or using an excuse to achieve a different, often hidden, goal. It conveys a sense of criticism or skepticism about the stated reason for an action. The nuance implies that the real reason is different from the apparent one. It is often used when the speaker suspects the true motivation behind someone's actions. It can be translated as \"under the guise of,\" \"using the excuse of,\" or \"under the pretext of.\"",
