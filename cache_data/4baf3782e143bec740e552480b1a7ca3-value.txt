  "writeup": "もし is an adverb used to emphasize the nuance of 'if', often in conjunction with other conditional particles like と, ば, なら, たら, and ても.  The literal meaning of もし is closer to 'while slight' or 'while small,' implying a low probability or a less certain condition.  To use もし, simply place it at the beginning of a conditional phrase.  It subtly adds a layer of emphasis, suggesting a hypothetical or even slightly improbable scenario.  A fun fact: もし is sometimes written as 若し, a kanji meaning 'low in (something),' which beautifully illustrates the particle's underlying meaning of 'while low in probability, number, age, or experience'.",
  "etymology": "The word もし originates from the kanji 若し (wakashi), meaning roughly 'if' or 'in the case that.'  The kanji itself combines 若 (waka), meaning 'young' or 'inexperienced,' and し, a particle indicating conditionality.  This etymology suggests that the original meaning of もし implied a conditionality based on a small probability or lacking experience, subtly conveying a sense of uncertainty or even a slight possibility.",

      "nuance": "This sentence uses the plain form of the verb 降る (furu, to rain).  The speaker is simply stating a plan contingent upon rain. 「雨が降ったら」 indicates that the action is dependent on rain and does not imply a low probability."

      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite form of the verb 会う (au, to meet) and the polite imperative ください (kudasai) are used, indicating respect for the listener. 「彼に会ったら」 creates a polite conditional statement."

      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the semi-formal negative form of ある (aru, to exist). The 「ませんか」 adds politeness and invites the listener.  This is a natural way to express interest in a future activity."

      "nuance": "This sentence uses the formal negative past form of the verb 来る (kuru, to come) and the passive form of the verb 中止する (chūshi suru, to cancel). 「来なかったら」 creates a formal conditional statement for conveying information."

      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses the casual form and 「彼氏」 (kareshi, boyfriend), making it informal. The use of な (na) at the end adds a softer touch, appropriate for flirting. 「毎日こんな風に優しくして欲しいな」 expresses a desire in a coy way, typical of a female speaker trying to flirt."

  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how もし emphasizes the hypothetical nature of the condition, even if the probability is relatively high.  The choice of verb conjugation affects the overall formality and the degree of politeness.",

      "meaning": "When, From when, Just when, If",

      "meaning": "If… then, (Conditional)",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "ば is a more classical and literary form of conditional, typically used with more formal grammar. It is less common in everyday speech than もし."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "While なら, たら, and ば can be used in similar situations to もし,  もし uniquely conveys the subtle sense of a less certain or somewhat improbable condition. Consider the implication of likelihood when selecting between these conditional particles. もし adds a nuanced layer of hypothetical emphasis that the others do not fully capture."
