    "etymology": "The origin of 「たら」 is complex, but it's generally believed to have evolved from the classical Japanese perfective aspect marker 「つ」, combined with the particle 「ら」, which indicates condition or hypotheticality. Over time, 「つら」 contracted to 「たら」.  The particle 「ら」 itself has roots in earlier forms of the language indicating a sequential or conditional relationship. Thus, 「たら」 carries a blend of completed action and conditional nuance.",
    "writeup": "「たら」 is a versatile conjunction particle in Japanese, functioning as a middle ground between \"if\" and \"when.\" It conveys the sense that once action A is completed, action B occurs as a result. This relationship can be hypothetical (future) or a one-time result from the past.  It's crucial to remember that while 「たら」 connects to the past form of verbs, adjectives, and nouns (via 「だった」), 「たら」 itself **doesn't inherently indicate past tense**. The sentence context determines the time frame. Unlike other \"if\" structures like 「ば」 and 「なら」, 「たら」 emphasizes the **completion** or **materialization** of the condition.",
