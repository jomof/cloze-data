    "etymology": "The kanji 毎 (まい) is derived from a pictograph of a woman's hairpin, representing something that is repeated or recurs regularly. Over time, it evolved to signify 'every' or 'each' in Japanese.",
    "writeup": "The prefix 毎 (まい) is used to indicate \"every\" or \"per\" when attached to a noun expressing a unit of time. It signifies that something occurs regularly within that time frame. For example, 毎日 (まいにち) means \"every day,\" and 毎月 (まいつき) means \"every month.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   毎 can only be used with nouns that specify a time period or a regularly occurring event. It cannot be used with nouns like 「人」(person) or 「家」(house) because these do not represent units of time. Instead, use 「全ての人」 (all people) or 「全ての家」 (all houses).",
