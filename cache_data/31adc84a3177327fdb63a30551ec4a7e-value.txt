  "writeup": "にとって (or に取って when written in kanji) is a grammatical structure expressing perspectives or opinions.  It typically follows names/pronouns but can also be used with nouns.  While often translated as 'to (A)', 'for (A)', or 'concerning (A)', its function mirrors から見て ('from the perspective of (A)').  Simply attach it to a noun (or noun phrase) to indicate the viewpoint.  The nuance is subtle but important.  It's about expressing judgment or opinion from a specific perspective. \n\n**Fun Fact:** にとって derives from the verb 取る (toru, 'to take').  Literally, it means 'taking up (A)'s standpoint', with the particle に marking this standpoint.  Its primary uses are:\n* の身として (no mi toshite) - From (A)'s standpoint (when used with people)\n* の立場から見て (no tachiba kara mite) - Viewing it from (A)'s perspective (when used with things)",
  "etymology": "The grammar point に取って comes from the verb 取る (toru), meaning \"to take.\"  In this context, it signifies \"taking up\" a particular perspective or point of view, making it an idiomatic expression rooted in the act of adopting a specific stance.",
