    "writeup": "The adverb 「結構 (kekkou)」 indicates that something exceeds the speaker's expectation to a considerable degree. It is similar to saying \"quite\" or \"rather\" in English. For example, you might say 「結構おいしい」 (kekkou oishii) to mean \"quite delicious.\" 「結構」 often conveys a sense of surprise or unexpectedness, implying that something is better than anticipated. It's a versatile word that can add nuance to your conversations.",
    "etymology": "「結構 (kekkou)」 originally meant \"structure\" or \"composition.\" Over time, it came to be used to describe things that are well-structured or well-done. From there, it evolved to express a sense of satisfaction or appreciation, eventually taking on the meaning of \"quite\" or \"rather.\"",
