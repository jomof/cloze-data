    "etymology": "「もの」 literally means \"thing\". When used at the end of a sentence, it adds a nuance of explanation or reason, as if saying \"だって〜なんだ**もの**！(but it's because ~ thing!)\". 「もん」 is a shortened, more emphatic version of 「もの」.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「もの」 is a sentence-ending particle that adds a soft, explanatory tone to a statement, often translated as \"because\" or \"since\". It implies a reason or justification for the statement. 「もの」 is considered casual and less formal than 「から」 or 「ので」. When shortened to 「もん」, it becomes even more casual and can sound childish or cute. Therefore, use 「もん」 with caution, especially in professional or formal settings. To emphasize the reason, you can use 「〜んだもの」 or 「〜なんですもの」. The 「ですもの」 form is slightly more polite, often found in anime, manga, and novels.",
