    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ていた」 expresses an action that was in progress at a specific time in the past or a state that existed in the past. It's formed by combining the て-form of a verb with the past tense of 「いる」 (to exist), which becomes 「いた」. 「ていました」 is the polite form. This construction is similar to the English \"was doing.\" It can also describe a past habit or something that was true in the past but is no longer true. It can also be used to express things that are still ongoing, but the speaker is not sure about, or would like to politely advise the listener about.",
    "etymology": "「て」 comes from the conjunctive particle 「て」, which links actions or states. 「いる」 is the verb meaning \"to exist\" or \"to be (doing).\" The past tense 「いた」 indicates that the action or state was in the past.",
