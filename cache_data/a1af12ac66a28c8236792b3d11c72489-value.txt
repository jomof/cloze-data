    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないでください」 is composed of three parts: 「ない」 (the negative form of a verb), 「で」 (a particle), and 「ください」 (the polite request form of 「くださる」, meaning 'to give'). The 「ないで」 portion indicates a state of 'without doing' something, and adding 「ください」 turns it into a polite request to refrain from that action.",
    "writeup": "「ないでください」 is used to politely request that someone *not* do something. It combines the casual negative form of a verb (ない), the particle で, and ください (the polite imperative form of くださる). ください is honorific language (敬語) used to refer to others' actions. The ください form of くださる is almost exclusively for making requests; くださる is the honorific equivalent of くれる. In casual conversation, ください may be omitted, using just the で form as a very casual way of saying \"please don't do (A).\" While ください is polite, ないでくれ (the conjunctive form of くれる) is too casual in most situations.",
