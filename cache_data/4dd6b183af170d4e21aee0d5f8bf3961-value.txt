    "etymology": "The grammar point 「だけましだ」 is composed of 「だけ」 (only, just) and 「ましだ」. 「まし」 is the conjunctive form of the verb 「増す」 (to increase, to be better). Therefore, the literal sense is that even just this is an improvement.",
    "writeup": "「だけましだ」 is a set phrase used to express that **at least** something is better than it could be, or that one should be **grateful for** a particular aspect of a situation, even if the overall situation isn't ideal.  It combines the particle 「だけ」, meaning \"only\" or \"just\", with 「ましだ」, where 「まし」 is derived from the verb 「増す」 (ます), meaning \"to increase\" or \"to be better\".  The 「だ」 is the plain copula.  So, literally, it conveys the idea that \"even just this is an improvement\".\n\nThis expression is commonly used when acknowledging a negative situation but focusing on a relatively positive aspect that makes it somewhat better than the alternative. 「まし」 is often written in hiragana, but you may also see it in katakana as 「マシ」, which can further emphasize the feeling of relief or gratitude for that particular aspect.\n\nWhile less frequent, you might encounter 「だけまだましだ」. The addition of 「まだ」 (still) simply intensifies the feeling that the current situation, while not perfect, is still preferable to what could have been.",
