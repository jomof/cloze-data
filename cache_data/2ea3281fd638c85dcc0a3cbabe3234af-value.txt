    "etymology": "「ざる」is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb「ず」, indicating negation. 「ず」itself is derived from older forms of negation in Japanese. It carries the same 'not' meaning as 「ない」, but is more formal and literary. Some dictionaries list 「ざる」 as the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「ざり」. However, 「ざり」itself is just a contraction of 「ず」 and 「あり」 'to be'. Due to this, both variations may be considered as correct, with 「ず」being the underlying origination.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[imperfective]+ざる」 is a way to express negation, similar to 「ない」, but with a more formal and literary tone. It's derived from classical Japanese and often translates to \"not\" or \"un-\" in English. You'll primarily encounter it in written materials, news articles, and established expressions, rather than everyday conversation. Be mindful that using it in casual speech might sound overly formal or old-fashioned. As with many old-fashioned grammar patterns, ざる will conjugate with the せ stem of する, rather than the more modern し stem.",
