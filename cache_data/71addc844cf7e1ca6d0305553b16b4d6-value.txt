  "writeup": "考えられない (kangae rarenai) is the negative potential form of the verb 考える (kangaeru), 'to consider' or 'to think'.  It expresses the idea that something is unimaginable or unthinkable from the speaker's perspective.  It's often used after adverbial particles like など (nado), なんか (nanka), or なんて (nante), or following phrases that nominalize a clause, such as ということは (to iu koto wa, 'that being the case').  The meaning is quite close to the literal translation:  \"cannot be thought of.\" \n\n**Important Consideration:** While 考えられない (kangae rarenai) implies an inability to imagine something—often due to its inherent unlikelihood—verbs like 考えない (kangaenai, 'to not consider') or 考えていない (kangaete inai, 'to not be considering') express a conscious choice or action by the speaker.  This crucial difference means you can only use 考えられない when referring to something unbelievable or absurd, something beyond the realm of reasonable thought.",
  "etymology": "The grammar point is formed by combining the negative potential form of the verb 考える (kangaeru, to think). The potential form indicates capability (in this case, the *in*capability) and the negative form negates the ability to think of something.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "あんなに優しい人が、人を傷つけるなんて考えられない。",
      "english": "It's unthinkable that such a kind person would hurt someone.",
      "register": "standard",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": "negative potential",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「あんなに優しい人」 (anna ni yasashii hito, such a kind person) to emphasize the contrast between the person's character and the unimaginable action.  This makes the unthinkableness more impactful. The sentence is fairly neutral, suitable for standard conversation, and serious context"

    {
      "japanese": "彼が突然会社を辞めるなんて、考えられないよ。",
      "english": "I can't imagine him quitting his job so suddenly.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": "negative potential",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「よ」(yo), a casual sentence ending making it appropriate for a relaxed conversation between close friends. The context is more reflective than accusatory or judgmental."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "こんな素敵なプレゼント、彼からもらえるなんて考えられなかったわ。",
      "english": "I never would have imagined receiving such a wonderful present from him.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "conjugation": "negative potential",
      "nuance": "The use of 「わ」(wa) is a typical female casual sentence ending.  The phrase 「こんな素敵なプレゼント」 (konna suteki na purezento, such a wonderful present) sets a flirty tone, suggesting a deeper meaning behind the gift. The sentence implies a surprise and delight, adding to the unexpected and romantic nature of the event."

    {
      "japanese": "彼女が私を拒絶するなんて、考えられなかった。",
      "english": "I couldn't believe she'd reject me.",

      "setting": "first-date",
      "conjugation": "negative potential",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "This casual sentence shows the speaker's disbelief and hurt feelings. The plain form of 考えられなかった is emotionally impactful here.  The context reflects a disappointed, perhaps even slightly hurt, individual after an unexpected rejection."

    {
      "japanese": "彼がそんなことをするとは、考えられない！",
      "english": "I can't believe he would do such a thing!",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "emergency/alarm",
      "conjugation": "negative potential",
      "nuance": "The exclamation point and the use of the plain form 「考えられない！」(kangae rarenai!) emphasize the speaker's shock and disbelief. The sentence suggests an urgent and unexpected situation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あの時、彼が私を助けてくれるとは考えられませんでした。",
      "english": "I never thought he'd help me back then.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": "past polite negative potential",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「考えられませんでした」(kangae raremasendeshita) shows respect towards the listener and creates a more formal and polite tone.The past tense emphasizes reflection on a past event."
    }
  ],
  "post_example_writeup": "The choice between plain and polite forms of 考えられない significantly affects the tone and formality of your speech.  Remember, context is key! In intimate settings, plain forms are common; polite forms are more suitable for formal contexts or when showing respect to someone older or of higher social standing.",
