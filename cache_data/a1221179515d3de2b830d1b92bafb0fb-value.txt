    "etymology": "The phrase 「そういえば」 is derived from 「そう」 (like that) and 「言えば」 (if you say). Literally, it means \"if you say that,\" implying that the preceding topic triggered a new thought or memory.",
    "writeup": "「そういえば」 is used to introduce a topic that the speaker has just remembered or that is related to the previous conversation. It's similar to saying \"speaking of which,\" \"by the way,\" or \"come to think of it\" in English. However, it's important to note that 「そういえば」 is typically used to transition to related topics, rather than completely unrelated ones. Unlike the English \"by the way,\" which can introduce a completely new subject, 「そういえば」 usually has some connection to what was previously discussed. 「そういえば」 appears at the beginning of a sentence, signaling that the speaker is about to bring up a related thought or memory. This phrase functions much like 「といえば」, with 「そう」 replacing the direct quotation 「と」. While some resources may group them, 「そういえば」 is essentially a set phrase in its own right.",
