  "writeup": "This grammar point, ものと思っていた (mono to omotte ita), uses the past tense of the verb 思う (omou, 'to think') combined with the noun 物 (mono, 'thing') to express a past assumption or belief.  It translates roughly to 'I was under the impression that...' or 'I thought that...'. The nuance lies in conveying a past belief that now may be proven incorrect or uncertain.  The structure is versatile, functioning like an adverbial clause modifying the main clause.  Its use is standard across most registers, though more casual variants exist. The use of  'mono' here is abstract; it's not necessarily a tangible object, but an understanding, expectation, or presumption.",
  "etymology": "The etymology is straightforward.  It combines 物 (mono), meaning 'thing' (often used abstractly), と (to), a particle indicating the object of a verb, 思っ (omotte), the stem of the past tense of the verb 思う (omou), meaning 'to think', and いた (ita), the past tense polite ending. The structure reflects a common Japanese pattern of using nouns and particles to create nuanced grammatical expressions.",
