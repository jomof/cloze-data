    "etymology": "The etymology of 「いよいよ」 is debated. One theory suggests it's derived from 「言う」 (iu, to say), emphasizing the culmination of events leading to a final statement or outcome. Another connects it to 「弥」 (iya), meaning 'increasingly' or 'more and more'.",
    "writeup": "「いよいよ」, typically written in hiragana, functions as an adverb indicating something (A) is finally happening after a prolonged period or a gradual build-up. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence or phrase, similar to other sentence-modifying adverbs. While it shares similarities with 「とうとう」 and 「ついに」, 「いよいよ」 is considered more casual. It also conveys the sense of something intensifying or escalating, translating to \"more and more\". Whether 「いよいよ」 signifies \"finally\" or \"more and more\" depends on the context of the following statement; a conclusive statement suggests \"finally,\" while an inconclusive one indicates \"more and more.\"",
