    "writeup": "**ようだ (you da)** is an auxiliary verb used to express that something \"seems like\" or \"appears to be\" a certain way. It's often based on direct information or experience, suggesting the speaker has a reasonable degree of confidence in their assessment. However, it indicates a degree of inference or judgment, distinguishing it from stating a known fact. \n\n*   **Forms:**\n    *   Verbs/い-adjectives: Use the plain form + ようだ.\n    *   な-adjectives: Use the stem + な + ようだ.\n    *   Nouns: Use the noun + の + ようだ.\n\n*   **ようだ** can be used to:\n    *   Give an example (たとえ)\n    *   Make an assumption (推定)\n    *   Present an illustration (例示)\n\n*   **Important Considerations:**\n    *   ようだ is more formal than みたい.\n    *   ようだ implies a higher degree of confidence than そうだ when based on observation.\n    *   Be aware of other similar grammar points such as ように, らしい, and そうだ to avoid confusion.",
    "etymology": "The word 「よう」 comes from the verb 「言う」 (iu, to say) and originally meant \"way of saying\" or \"manner.\" Over time, it evolved to express a resemblance or approximation, hence its current meaning of \"like\" or \"similar to.\" The 「だ」 is the plain form of the copula 「です」, indicating a statement or assertion.",
