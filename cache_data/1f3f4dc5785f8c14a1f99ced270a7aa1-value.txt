  "writeup": "風 (fū) is a suffix used to indicate style or fashion.  It literally translates to \"wind of,\" but its function is to express something being in the style of something else.  Attach it to the end of a noun to modify another noun, suggesting a particular style.  For instance,  \"90年代風 (90-nendai-fū)\" means \"90s style.\" You can also use の (no) between the noun and 風 to clarify the relationship:  \"メキシコ風 (Mekishiko-fū) の 料理 (ryōri)\" means \"Mexican-style food.\"  Remember, as a suffix with this meaning, 風 is *always* pronounced  fū, never かぜ (kaze), which is the typical reading for \"wind.\"",
  "etymology": "The use of 風 (fū) to mean style likely stems from the evocative imagery of wind carrying characteristics and influences.  Just as the wind carries scents and sounds, this grammatical usage implies that the style or fashion is imbued with the essence of the originating noun.",
