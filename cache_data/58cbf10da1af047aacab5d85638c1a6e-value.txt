    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「と」 (a quotation particle), 「言う」 (iu, to say), and 「より」 (yori, than). The combination creates a structure that compares two statements, suggesting the latter is more accurate or suitable.",
    "writeup": "「というより」 is used to suggest that one statement is more accurate or fitting than another. Think of it as saying \"rather than A, it's more like B.\" It's often used when you want to correct or refine a previous statement. Keep in mind that 「より」 highlights what is 'less' applicable, so the part after 「というより」 will always be the 'better' or more accurate description.",
