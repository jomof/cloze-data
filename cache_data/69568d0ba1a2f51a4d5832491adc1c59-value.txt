    "etymology": "The grammar point 「との」 is derived from the particle 「と」, used to mark quotations or content, combined with the particle 「の」, which indicates possession, connection, or attribution. It essentially means “of that which was said” or “related to that content”.",
    "writeup": "「との」 is a compound particle composed of the case-marking particle 「と」 in its quotative use and the case-marking particle 「の」. It marks the preceding statement as a quote, and then 「の」 indicates that the entire statement is an attribute of the following noun. It often translates to \"that,\" \"regarding,\" or \"concerning.\" As with 「と」, it appears after almost any word, and 「だ」 may be omitted after nouns and な-adjectives.\n\nThis expression indicates that the preceding information is a communication of some type. It is typically followed by a noun highlighting the type of communication, such as:\n\n*   提案 (ていあん): \"proposal\"\n*   知らせ (しらせ): \"notice\"\n*   意向 (いこう): \"intention\"\n*   依頼 (いらい): \"request\"\n*   見方 (みかた): \"point of view\"\n*   指摘 (してき): \"pointing out\"\n*   報告 (ほうこく): \"report\"",
