    "etymology": "The auxiliary verb 「まい」 is believed to have originated from the combination of the negative auxiliary 「ぬ」 (archaic form of 「ない」) and the volitional auxiliary 「む」 (archaic form of 「う・よう」). Over time, 「ぬ」 transformed into 「な」 and combined with 「む」 to form 「なむ」, which eventually contracted to 「ん」 and then 「まい」. Thus, it carries the combined sense of negation and volition, expressing a strong intention not to do something or a strong presumption against it.",

    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb 「まい」 is used to express negative volition or a strong conjecture against something happening. It attaches to the **base form of verbs**.  It carries a more formal nuance and is often used in situations where the speaker wants to emphasize their determination not to do something or their strong belief that something will not occur. It can be translated as \"won't,\" \"intend not to,\" or \"probably not.\" Think of it as a more emphatic and slightly literary way of saying  「～ないだろう」.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   When 「まい」 is used with the verbs する (to do) or 来る (to come), it frequently appears in the conjunctive forms 「しまい」, 「すまい」, 「きまい」, and 「こまい」.  However, the forms 「するまい」 and 「来るまい」 are also common.\n*   While 「まい」 can express intention, it often leans towards expressing a strong presumption or conjecture, especially in modern Japanese.",
