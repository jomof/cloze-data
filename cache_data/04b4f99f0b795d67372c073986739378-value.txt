  "writeup": "The phrase ないほうがいい (nai hō ga ii) is a common way to give advice in Japanese, suggesting that it's better *not* to do something.  It's a useful expression for expressing a preference against a particular action.  This structure combines the negative form of a verb with the particle が and the i-adjective いい (ii, 'good').  The particle が emphasizes that \"not doing\" is the preferable way or option.  While seemingly straightforward, it can subtly imply potential negative consequences if the advised action *is* taken.  The nuance depends heavily on context and tone of voice.",
  "etymology": "This phrase's construction is based on the classic Japanese way of expressing preference using particles and adjectives.  The negative verb form highlights the undesirability, while  ほうがいい (hō ga ii) – literally 'the way is good' – expresses the preferred alternative. The particle が marks the topic of the sentence which is, in this case, the preferred option of 'not doing something'.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "これはお兄ちゃんが買ったピザだから、食べ**ないほうがいい**よ。",
      "english": "Since this is pizza my brother bought, you shouldn't eat it.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "friendly",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The \"よ\" at the end of the sentence softens the command, making it suitable for a casual conversation between an older and younger person.  The phrase 「食べないほうがいい」 directly advises against eating the pizza.  The explanation, 「これはお兄ちゃんが買ったピザだから」 makes the reason for the advice clear"
    },
    {
      "japanese": "その肉は古いかもしれないから、食べ**ないほうがいい**ですよ。",
      "english": "That meat might be old, so you shouldn't eat it.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The politeness marker 「ですよ」makes the suggestion more respectful and appropriate for a variety of contexts.  The sentence structure, again using 「食べないほうがいい」, is straightforward and easy to understand. The reason 「その肉は古いかもしれないから」 is added to justify the advice."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "今夜は遅くまで仕事しない**ほうがいい**ね。疲れるよ。",
      "english": "You shouldn't work late tonight. You'll get tired.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "supportive",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The use of ね (ne) softens the statement, making it more friendly and less like a direct order. The phrase 「仕事しないほうがいい」 again directly advises against working late. The additional comment 「疲れるよ」 explains the potential negative consequence in a casual way;  suitable between a female and male of different ages, and sounds quite natural."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼と付き合うのは、ない**ほうがいい**よ。",
      "english": "You shouldn't date him.",

      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The casual 「よ」 at the end makes this advice friendly but firm. 「付き合うのは、ないほうがいい」 is direct, leaving no room for misunderstanding.  This usage is common among female friends giving each other advice"
    },
    {
      "japanese": "そんな危険な場所に一人で行くのは、絶対ない**ほうがいい**です。",
      "english": "You absolutely shouldn't go to such a dangerous place alone.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The formal 「です」and the emphatic 「絶対」show seriousness.  The use of 「危険な場所に一人で行くのは、ないほうがいい」 conveys strong disapproval and warning."

    {
      "japanese": "もっとゆっくり話さない**ほうがいい**ですか？",
      "english": "Shouldn't we talk more slowly?",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "negotiating",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The question form 「ですか？」shows politeness and seeks agreement. 「ゆっくり話さないほうがいい」 suggests a more preferable pace of conversation in a polite way"
    },
        {
      "japanese": "あの人と、そんなに深く関わらない**ほうがいい**と思うよ。",
      "english": "I think you shouldn't get too involved with that person.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "cautious",
      "conjugation": "dictionary form",
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「と思うよ」 to express the speaker's opinion casually and politely.  「そんなに深く関わらないほうがいい」 provides gentle yet firm advice, appropriate in a friendly setting."

      "meaning": "Should not, Must not, Ought not to",
      "kind": "synonym",
      "nuance": "While both express that something shouldn't be done, べきではない is more formal and emphasizes a moral or logical obligation not to do something. ないほうがいい focuses on the negative consequences of performing the action"
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that ないほうがいい is a suggestion based on avoiding negative outcomes.  For stronger obligations or moral imperatives, use べき or ことだ.  For expressing hopes or desires, use たらいい or といい.  The nuance of each expression varies greatly, so context is paramount."
