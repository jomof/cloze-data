  "formation": {
    "[A より] + [B のほうが] + [Adjective/Noun]": "Indicates that B is more [Adjective/Noun] than A."
  },
  "etymology": "This phrase combines several core elements of Japanese grammar.  \"より\" (yori) originates from the verb \"寄る\" (yoru) meaning 'to approach' or 'to lean towards,'  evolving to indicate comparison.  \"のほう\" (no hō) literally means 'that direction/side,' implying a preferential choice.  \"が\" (ga) is the grammatical subject marker. The combination elegantly expresses preference and comparative degree.",
  "writeup": "The expression より～のほうが (yori ~ no hō ga) is a fundamental comparative structure in Japanese, indicating that something is 'more [adjective]' or 'more [noun]' than something else. It's frequently used in everyday conversation and across various registers.  Think of it as a more nuanced way of saying \"more than.\"  \"より\" (yori) signifies 'than,' while \"のほうが\" (no hō ga) indicates the superior element in the comparison.  The structure is versatile, applicable to adjectives, nouns, and even verbs when appropriately modified.  For instance, you can compare the *deliciousness* of two foods or the *enjoyability* of two activities.  Important considerations are that the structure works with an adjective or a noun modifying the particle の. The particles が and を can both be used with this expression, and the difference between them is subtle. Generally が indicates a preference, while を indicates a direct comparison, and を is used almost exclusively with たい or ほしい.",
