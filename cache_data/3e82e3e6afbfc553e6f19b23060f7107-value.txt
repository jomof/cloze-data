    "etymology": "The word 「反面 (hanmen)」 literally means \"opposite side\" or \"reverse side.\" It comes from 「反 (han)」 meaning \"opposite\" or \"reverse\" and 「面 (men)」 meaning \"side\" or \"aspect.\" Therefore, the grammar point uses the literal meaning of the word to indicate contrasting aspects.",
    "writeup": "「反面 (hanmen)」 is used to present two contrasting aspects of the same subject. It often translates to \"while,\" \"on the other hand,\" or \"although.\" It's important to note that 「反面」 is used to express contradictions, often highlighting a positive and a negative aspect, rather than two positives or two negatives. Being a noun, 「反面」 can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns + 「である」.",
