    "writeup": "「とばかり」 is a construction often used to describe a situation where someone acts or behaves **as if they are saying something without actually saying it**.  It conveys a strong feeling or intention that is almost palpable. It combines the quotation particle 「と」 and the adverbial particle 「ばかり」, which emphasizes that the action or behavior is **entirely in line with** or **nothing but** the implied thought or statement. The 「に」 is often added when the sentence continues with a description of the actual situation or reaction.\n\n「とばかりに」 can be seen as an abbreviation of 「と言わんばかりに」, which literally means \"to the point of almost saying it\". 「言わん」 here is a contraction of 「言わぬ」, using the classical negative auxiliary verb 「ぬ」.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「とばかりに」 describes the **observable behavior** that implies a certain thought or statement. It's not used to describe the speaker's own thoughts or feelings directly.\n*   While primarily used for others, it can occasionally describe the speaker in third-person narration.",
