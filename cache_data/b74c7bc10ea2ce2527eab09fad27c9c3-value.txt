    "etymology": "The grammar point に足りない comes from the combination of the case-marking particle に and the verb 足りる (tariru), meaning \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be enough.\" Thus, に足りない literally means \"not sufficient for.\"",
    "writeup": "に足りない is a grammar expression that follows the dictionary form of a verb to indicate that something is \"not worth (A)\" or \"not sufficient for (A).\" It combines the particle に with the る-verb 足りる (tariru, \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be enough\"). This structure is formal and commonly appears in literature or formal speech settings.\n\nWhile に足りない may seem similar to に足る in that they both point out the worth (or lack thereof) of something, they use different verbs. 足る is an う-verb more common in literature or western Japan. Its negative form is 足らない (taranai), not 足りない.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\nBoth 足りない and 足らない can be part of the set phrase 取るに足りない (toru ni tarinai), meaning \"to be worthless\" or \"not worth discussing.\"",
