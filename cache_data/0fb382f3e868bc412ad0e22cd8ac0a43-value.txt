    "etymology": "The term 「決して」 comes from the て-form of the verb 「決する」 (kessuru), meaning \"to decide\" or \"to determine\". Thus, 「決して」 implies a strong decision or determination *not* to do something.",
    "writeup": "「決して〜ない」 (kesshite ~ nai) is used to express a strong negation, meaning \"never,\" \"by no means,\" or \"under no circumstances.\"  「決して」 functions as an adverb that emphasizes the negative statement. It can appear at the beginning of a sentence or directly before the verb it modifies. While the translation is often \"never\", the literal sense is closer to \"decidedly not\" or \"assuredly not\".  Note that 「決して」 is often used with negative verb forms 「〜ない」 but can also be used with other structures like 「〜ものか」 to strongly emphasize rejection or impossibility. For example, 「決して許さない」 means \"I will never forgive you.\"",
