    "etymology": "「なぜなら」 is a conjunction composed of 「なぜ」 (why) and 「なら」, the hypothetical form of 「だ」. 「から」 is the particle indicating reason or cause. Together, they create a set phrase emphasizing the reason being given.",
    "writeup": "The pattern 「なぜなら〜から」 is used to emphasize the reason for a statement. 「なぜなら」 (or 「なぜならば」) combined with the particle 「から」 forms a set expression. It highlights that a \"because\" is coming, drawing attention to it.\n\nThe primary function of 「なぜなら」 (as opposed to simply using 「から」 or 「ので」) is to gain the listener's attention and signal that important information is coming. Essentially, it is similar to saying, \"Why is (A) so? (B) is the cause.\"\n\nTo use 「なぜなら〜から」, state the fact or important piece of information as (A). Then, begin a new sentence with 「なぜなら」, followed by the reason (B), ending with 「から」.",
