  "writeup": "ばかりでなく combines the adverbial particle ばかり with the conjugated (and negated) form of the auxiliary verb だ.  It translates as 'not only (A), (B)', or 'not limited to (A), (B).'  Since ばかり is an adverbial particle, it pairs with the attributive form of other words.  While variations exist—でなく, でなくて, ではなく, ではなくて, じゃなく, じゃなくて—the addition of the は particle emphasizes ない.  Importantly, ばかりでなく is considered the more formal version of だだけでなく;  だだけでなく appears far more frequently in everyday speech and writing.",
  "etymology": "The phrase's core lies in ばかり (bakari), meaning 'only,' 'just,' or 'nothing but.'  The addition of でなく (de naku), the negative form of だ (da), creates the contrastive meaning of 'not only...but also.'  This structure highlights a contrast and emphasizes the inclusion of both elements.",
