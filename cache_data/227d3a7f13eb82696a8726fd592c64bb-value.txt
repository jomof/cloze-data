  "writeup": "から見ると (kara miruto) is a common Japanese sentence pattern used to express a perspective or judgment based on observation.  It's literally 'from looking (at) ~, then...' but translates more naturally as \"From the point of view of...\" or \"Judging by...\"  This construction combines the particle から (kara, 'from'), the verb 見る (miru, 'to see' or 'to look at'), and a following clause. The following clause often uses と (to), たら (tara), or ば (ba), indicating a hypothetical or inferred conclusion based on the observation.  The nuance shifts subtly depending on the chosen particle.  For instance, using と suggests a more direct observation, while たら implies a conditional outcome.  This grammatical structure is typically used following nouns and is commonly used in both formal and informal settings.  It is important to note that から見ると is generally avoided with abstract concepts or things that can't be directly observed, unlike similar phrases like からすると.",
  "etymology": "The etymology of から見ると is straightforward.  から (kara) is a particle indicating origin or starting point; 見る (miru) is the dictionary form of the verb meaning \"to see\" or \"to look\"; and と (to) is a conjunction particle that introduces the following clause, indicating the conclusion drawn from observation.  The combined phrase's meaning evolved naturally from the literal meaning of its component parts. The usage reflects how judgments are often made based on observation.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "子供から見ると、大人は何でも知っているように見える。",
      "english": "From a child's point of view, adults seem to know everything.",
      "register": "standard",
      "setting": "reflective",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses simple vocabulary and a straightforward structure, typical of descriptions from a child's perspective.  The 「大人は何でも知っているように見える」 (adults seem to know everything) part reflects the child's limited understanding of the world."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の行動から見ると、彼は正直な人ではないようだ。",
      "english": "Judging by his actions, he doesn't seem like an honest person.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "serious",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The choice of 「ようだ」 (seems) softens the conclusion, making the statement less direct and accusatory—suitable for a semi-formal setting where direct accusations might be inappropriate. The use of 「行動」 (actions) suggests an objective observation rather than subjective interpretation."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "この絵から見ると、作者は自然を愛していると感じます。",
      "english": "From looking at this painting, I feel that the artist loved nature.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "academic",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The polite register (using 「と感じます」- kanjimasu) is fitting for academic discussion or art criticism. The phrase 「自然を愛している」 (loved nature) is a subjective interpretation based on the objective observation of the painting."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "彼の発言から見れば、彼はこの計画に反対しているだろう。",
      "english": "Judging from his statements, he would likely oppose this plan.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「だろう」 (darou) implies a strong inference but avoids a definitive statement.  This tentative style is common in professional settings, maintaining a degree of politeness."

    {
      "japanese": "あなたの笑顔から見ると、とても幸せそうですね。",
      "english": "From your smile, you seem very happy.",

      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「ですね」 (desune) and the indirect compliment 「幸せそうですね」(seem very happy) are a gentle and polite way for a man to flirt with a woman.  The use of 「笑顔」(emile) is a visually-based assessment, making から見ると appropriate."

    {
      "japanese": "あの人の服装から見ると、お金持ちかもしれない。",
      "english": "Judging by their clothes, they might be rich.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "casual",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual register and the use of 「かもしれない」 (kamoshirenai) makes the statement speculative and suitable for casual conversation. The phrase 「服装」(clothing) again makes this sentence suitable for から見ると."

    {
      "japanese": "このデータから見て、売上は増加傾向にあると予測できます。",
      "english": "Based on this data, we can predict an increase in sales.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal tone, use of 「予測できます」 (can predict), and the subject matter are suited to professional reporting and presentations. The use of 「データ」(data) suggests a more objective observation rather than a subjective opinion."

      "meaning": "Even..., Judging from, Based on",

  "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, consider the focus of each phrase. から見ると emphasizes visual observation; the others offer variations in perspective, reasoning, comparison, or the expression of opinion.  Choose the phrase that best reflects the type of judgment or inference you want to express."
