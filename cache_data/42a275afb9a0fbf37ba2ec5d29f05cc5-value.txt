  "writeup": "Certainly, \"tashikani\" (確かに) is an adverb derived from the na-adjective \"tashika\" (確か), meaning 'certain' or 'sure'.  It functions similarly to 'certainly' or 'surely' in English, emphasizing the definite truth of a statement.  However, a crucial difference exists:  In Japanese, 確かに primarily serves to affirm information; unlike its English counterpart, it doesn't imply permission. For example,  \"Certainly, you can go\" would not be naturally expressed with 確かに.  Another important point: omitting the \"ni\" particle transforms 確か into an expression closer to \"if I recall correctly\" or \"if I'm not mistaken.\"",
  "etymology": "The word 確かに (tashikani) comes from the adjective 確か (tashika), meaning 'certain' or 'reliable'. The addition of に turns it into an adverb, modifying the following clause to express certainty.",
