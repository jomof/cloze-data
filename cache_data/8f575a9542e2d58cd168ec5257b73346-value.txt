    "writeup": "**どんどん** (or ドンドン) is one of the countless words in Japanese that represent a particular sound or sensation. These words are known as onomatopoeia (オノマトペ in Japanese). **どんどん** represents the sound of banging (like on a drum), or the pounding of feet. In this way, it is regularly translated as \"rapidly\", or \"quickly\". Like **だんだん**, **どんどん** may be used before almost any phrase.

While **どんどん** can take the particle **と**, it is not required. In fact, **と** is very often omitted from adverbs/onomatopoeic words in Japanese.

**Important Consideration:**

Initially, it can be easy to mix up **どんどん** with **だんだん**. **だんだん** is used to express slower changes, and may be thought of as similar to \"steadily\", or \"step by step\" in English.

**Fun Fact:**

When the **と** particle is used with onomatopoeic words, it is very similar to one of **と**'s main usages as a quotation marker in Japanese. This means that **と** has a similar role to words like \"went\", or \"goes\" in English. For example, in English, we would say: \"The door 'goes' BANG with the wind.\" However, the door doesn't actually 'go' anywhere. This is similar to what **と** is doing here.",
