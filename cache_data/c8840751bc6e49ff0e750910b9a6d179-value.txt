    "writeup": "「がいる」 is a common construction formed by the particle 「が」 and the verb 「いる」. This expression means \"to exist\" or \"there is\" and is used for living or animate things. Because the subjects in these examples are considered alive (or operated by something alive), 「いる」 is the appropriate verb. 「ある」 is used for inanimate objects.\n\nThe polite form of 「いる」 is 「います」. The removal of 「る」 indicates that 「いる」 is a る-Verb (Ichidan verb).\n\nThe kanji form, 「居る」, is frequently used and should be learned early to avoid reading confusion. There's no difference in nuance whether this expression is written with or without kanji; it's a matter of writer preference.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nThe particle 「が」 in 「がいる」 is often omitted in casual speech or writing styles mimicking casual speech (like in manga or instant messaging).",
