    "etymology": "The grammar point 「と〜と、どちらが」 is composed of:\n\n*   「と」 (to): The particle 「と」 here functions to list items or options, similar to \"and\".\n*   「どちら」 (dochira): This is the polite form of 「どっち」 (docchi), meaning \"which\". It's derived from 「ど」 (do), indicating direction or way, and 「方」 (chira), meaning side or direction.\n*   「が」 (ga): The subject marker particle, indicating the focus of the question.",
    "writeup": "「と〜と、どちらが」 is used to ask which of two options someone prefers. It's like saying \"Which one between A and B...?\" in English. \n\n*   「どちら」 is the polite version of 「どっち」, so using 「どちら」 makes the question more formal. You can use 「どっち」 in casual conversation.\n*   The second 「と」 can be omitted, as 「どちら」 implies that both A and B are part of the comparison.\n*   You can use verbs or actions by nominalizing them with 「こと」 or 「の」.\n\n「どちら様ですか」 is also used as a polite way to ask \"Who are you?\" when you don't know the person.",
