  "writeup": "ことは～が is a set expression indicating that 'while something is (A), also (B)'.  In English, this is usually interpreted as '(A) is true, but (B)', or 'although (A), (B)'.  The same word is repeated before both ことは and が (or けど).  This emphasizes the speaker acknowledges (A) but wants to express something contrary. ことは～が can be used with any word type, but だ follows nouns before が, while な, である, だった, or ではない follow な-adjectives.  Mostly, ことは～が expresses that (A) is true, but the speaker has a contrasting opinion or impression.",
  "etymology": "The structure leverages ことは, meaning 'the fact that…', highlighting the acknowledgement of a preceding statement before introducing a contrasting point with が.  The repetition emphasizes the contrast, making it a strong but natural way to express nuanced opinions.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "漢字は読める**ことは読める**が、簡単な漢字しか読めないです。",
      "english": "It's true I can read kanji, but only easy ones.",
      "register": "semi-formal",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The sentence uses 「読めることは読める」 to acknowledge the ability to read kanji before contrasting it with the limitation to simple kanji.  This is a common way to soften a negative statement in semi-formal situations."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "新しい家は広い**ことは広い**けど、家具が多いから狭く見える。",
      "english": "My new house is spacious, but it looks small because of all the furniture.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The use of 「広いことは広い」 followed by けど, a casual conjunction,  makes this statement informal and conversational. The contrast highlights the unexpected visual effect despite the spaciousness."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "ここは道路な**ことは道路**だけど、狭すぎて車が通れない。",
      "english": "It is a road, but it's too narrow for cars.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The casual 「だけど」 and the straightforward description of the road's inadequacy make this suitable for casual conversation.  The structure 「道路なことは道路」 emphasizes the speaker's awareness of its status as a road before pointing out its practical shortcoming."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "優しい**ことは優しい**が、自分の家族に対してだけだ。",
      "english": "She's kind, but only to her own family.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The use of 「優しいことは優しい」 followed by 「だけだ」 which is a more direct way of contrasting the kindness with a restriction, makes the statement blunt. This is appropriate for a male speaker speaking to another male, emphasizing a lack of general kindness."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたと一緒なら、どこへでも行ける**ことは行ける**けど、ちょっと怖い。",
      "english": "I could go anywhere with you, but I'm a little scared.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The 「行けることは行ける」 emphasizes the possibility, setting a flirty stage for the playful fear expressed.  The sentence also demonstrates a typical feminine way of expressing hesitation with 「ちょっと怖い」."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "あなたの笑顔、素敵だ**ことは素敵**だけど、僕の心臓をドキドキさせすぎだよ。",
      "english": "Your smile is lovely, but it makes my heart race too much.",

      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": null,
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The use of 「素敵だことは素敵」 creates an opening for a compliment before playfully complaining about the effect of the smile.  The directness and playful nature of the statement are appropriate for a male flirting with a female."

    {
      "japanese": "この仕事は簡単**であることは簡単**ですが、責任が大きすぎます。",
      "english": "This job is easy, but the responsibility is too great.",
      "register": "formal",
      "setting": "professional",
      "conjugation": null,
      "nuance": "The formal register is established by using 「ですが」 and 「簡単であることは簡単」 in the formal expression, balancing the acknowledgement of the easy aspect with a serious concern about the high responsibility. This is suitable for a formal professional setting."

  "post_example_writeup": "Notice how the context and the choice of conjunction (が vs. けど) subtly shift the nuance.  Mastering this subtle shift is key to using ことは～が effectively.",
