  "writeup": "The negative form of る-verbs is straightforward.  We simply attach ない (casual) or ません (polite) to the dictionary form of the verb after removing the final る.  While often translated simply as 'not', these negative forms convey nuances of 'don't' (habitual negation), 'won't' (intentional negation), or 'can't' (inability).  Both ない and ません are auxiliary verbs; ません is a polite form derived from ます.  This means they have their own conjugation rules, distinct from the main verb's conjugation.  **Important:** The ない used to negate い-adjectives is a different word entirely, and its conjugation behaves differently.  In that context, ない itself functions as an い-adjective.",
  "etymology": "The negative suffix ない is derived from the older form なず, which was originally an adverb meaning 'not yet' or 'never'.  The polite form ません comes from the addition of the polite suffix ます to the negative ない.",
