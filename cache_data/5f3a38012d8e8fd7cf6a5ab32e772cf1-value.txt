  "writeup": "なくてもいい (nakute mo ii) means \"don't have to.\"  It's the polite antonym of てもいい (te mo ii), \"it's okay to.\"  This construction conveys a sense of permission or leniency; it's like saying, \"You don't need to worry about doing that.\" The structure combines the negative ない (nai) in its te-form (nakute), the particle も (mo) emphasizing inclusiveness, and いい (ii), meaning \"good\" or \"okay.\" In casual conversation, the も (mo) can be omitted, making it sound more natural and friendly among close acquaintances.  This omission doesn't alter the core meaning but softens the formality.",
  "etymology": "This grammar point is a combination of two independent parts:  なくて (nakute), the negative te-form of ない (nai, 'not'), and いい (ii, 'good' or 'okay').  The particle も (mo) adds emphasis, indicating that the action is not necessary, even if it were to be done.",

      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "speaker_age": "older",
      "listener_age": "younger",
      "nuance": "The 「よ」 (yo) ending makes this sentence explicitly casual, suitable for an older speaker addressing a younger listener.  The omission of 「も」 (mo) further contributes to the casualness."

    {
      "japanese": "その映画を見なくてもいいです。",
      "english": "You don't have to watch that movie.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "informative",
      "conjugation": "polite negative",
      "nuance": "The polite form 「です」 (desu) makes the sentence appropriate for a formal context or when speaking to a stranger or someone of higher status.  The absence of any slang or overly familiar language keeps the tone professional. "
    },
    {
      "japanese": "遅刻しても、怒らなくてもいいですよ。",
      "english": "Even if you're late, you don't have to be angry.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "supportive",
      "conjugation": "polite negative",
      "nuance": "The politeness marker 「ですよ」 (desu yo) softens the advice, making it more reassuring and less commanding. The phrase 「遅刻しても」 (chikokushite mo) shows that even if something bad happened, the speaker is providing comfort and reassurance."
    },
    {
      "japanese": "明日来なくてもいいけど、寂しくなるよ。",
      "english": "You don't have to come tomorrow, but I'll miss you.",
      "register": "casual",
      "setting": "flirty",
      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "speaker_gender": "male",
      "listener_gender": "female",
      "nuance": "The 「けど」 (kedo) acts as a contrastive conjunction, creating a sense of playful tension, typical of flirtatious conversation. The 「寂しくなるよ」(sabishiku naru yo) is a classic flirty phrase to soften a potentially harsh message, particularly when spoken by a male to a female."

    {
      "japanese": "忙しいから、手伝わなくてもいいですよ。",
      "english": "Because you're busy, you don't have to help.",
      "register": "polite",
      "setting": "sympathetic",
      "conjugation": "polite negative",
      "nuance": "The reason 「忙しいから」(Isogashii kara) is given to explain why the help isn't needed. The polite ending keeps the tone understanding and not demanding. This is often used in situations where the speaker understands that the listener might feel obligated to help, but wants to reassure them that such is not the case."

      "japanese": "私と一緒にお酒を飲まなくてもいい？",
      "english": "You don't have to drink with me?",

      "conjugation": "plain negative",
      "speaker_gender": "female",
      "listener_gender": "male",
      "nuance": "The 「？」(?) at the end makes it sound like an invitation, rather than a statement. This is a common tactic in early-stage romantic interactions, where a woman might express this to gauge the man's interest and intentions without being overly forward."
    }

  "post_example_writeup": "Remember that context is crucial.  While なくてもいい is generally polite, it can feel demanding if the speaker's tone or the situation suggests an expectation of action.",

    {
      "term": "なくてはいけない",
      "meaning": "Must do, Have to do",
      "kind": "antonym",
      "nuance": "Unlike なくてもいい, which indicates something isn't necessary, なくてはいけない expresses obligation."

    {
      "term": "てはいけない",
      "meaning": "Must not, May not",
      "kind": "contrasting",
      "nuance": "This phrase emphasizes prohibition, the opposite of the permission implied by なくてもいい."

    {
      "term": "てはならない",
      "meaning": "Must not, Cannot, Should not",
      "kind": "contrasting",

    {
      "term": "ことはない",
      "meaning": "There is no need to, Never happens",
      "kind": "similar but distinct",
      "nuance": "While both express lack of necessity, ことない is more emphatic and implies a stronger sense of unnecessity or impossibility."
    }
  ],
  "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to differentiating these expressions lies in understanding the nuance of necessity versus prohibition versus simple lack of need.  なくてはいけない implies a strong obligation, while てはいけない and てはならない express clear prohibition. ことない suggests a more absolute lack of necessity or even possibility.  Pay close attention to the context to avoid confusion."
