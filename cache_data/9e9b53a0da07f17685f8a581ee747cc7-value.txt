    "etymology": "The word 「かた」 means 「方」 (direction, way), and 「がた」 is a pluralizing suffix, often used for people. However, in this case, 「かたがた」 signifies doing something in multiple \"directions\" or for multiple \"reasons\" simultaneously.",
    "writeup": "「かたがた」 is a conjunction primarily seen in hiragana, though it has a kanji form 「旁」. It translates to \"in addition to (A), (B),\" \"along with (A), (B),\" or \"incidentally to (A), (B).\" Both (A) and (B) have relatively equal priority, but (B) carries the nuance of \"while (A), also (B) in passing.\" 「かたがた」 attaches to a noun that marks (A), while (B) often involves a verb of action. When (A) is a noun typically used with 「する」, the 「する」 is omitted. It's a formal structure mainly used in writing, often in apologies or thanks. It may sound unnatural if there is no special reason for linking the actions.",
