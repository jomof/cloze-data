  "etymology": "上で (ue de) literally translates to \"on top of.\"  The particle 上 (ue) means \"above\" or \"on top of,\" and the particle で (de) indicates the means or manner.  The nuanced meaning of \"after\" or \"upon\" arises from the context, implying a sequential relationship where one action precedes another. This evolution demonstrates the fascinating way Japanese grammar often develops a figurative meaning from a literal base.",
  "writeup": "The Japanese grammar point 上で (ue de) translates to \"after\" or \"upon.\"  It follows the past tense of verbs or nouns with の. It signifies that something happens *after* or *upon* the completion of a prior action.  Think of it as meaning 'with the above/previous (A), (B)'.  The word 上 (ue) means 'above' and で (de) indicates a means or manner.  This is primarily a formal expression; you won't use it in casual conversation.  Crucially, 上で implies a logical progression where (A) is a necessary prerequisite for (B).  Important Consideration: Because 上で highlights this logical sequence, (A) cannot be a passive verb. Passivity in Japanese suggests a lack of control, making a planned progression from (A) to (B) illogical. This contrasts with English passive voice, which simply indicates that something is acted upon. This subtle difference is critical in conveying intention and causality within the context of the sentence.",
