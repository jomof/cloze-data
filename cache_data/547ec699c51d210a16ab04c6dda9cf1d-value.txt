    "writeup": "「ていた」 (or its polite form 「ていました」) is used to describe an action that **was in progress in the past**.  Think of it like the \"past continuous\" tense in English. It conveys the idea that something was happening over a period of time before another event or before the present moment.\n\nYou can use 「ていた」 in a few different situations:\n\n*   **Describing an ongoing action in the past:**  This is the most straightforward use.  It emphasizes the duration of the action.\n*   **Describing a state that was true in the past:**  Sometimes, 「ていた」 can describe a state or condition that existed over a period of time in the past. For instance, something \"was broken\".\n*   **Expressing something that you used to do (habitually):**  While there are other grammar points specifically for past habits, 「ていた」 can sometimes imply a past habit, especially when combined with time expressions like 「昔は」 (in the past).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The 「て」 form is the conjunctive form of a verb.\n*   「いた」 is the past tense of the verb 「いる」 (to exist).  So, literally, 「ていた」 means \"being in a state of having done something\".",
