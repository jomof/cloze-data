END_RECORDS

I chose to focus on records that had fewer than 8 sentences, had inconsistent English, or had poor nuances.

The `negative-い-adjective` record had the word "wish" in nuance7.  I changed it to "hope" to make it more abstract.

The `te-form-い-adjective` record had only two sentences, so I added six more.

The English in the `お○○する (humble)` record was repetitive and not very idiomatic, so I improved it.

The nuances in the `ことだ (advice)` record were too specific and repetitive, so I generalized them.

For the N2 and N1 level grammar points, I added more sentences to reach the target of 8.  I also corrected some nuances that were too specific.  For example, in the `に違いない` record, nuance6 was "Expressing an opinion based on hearsay information about a restaurant".  I changed it to "Expressing an opinion based on reputation", which is more abstract.

It is important to note that the `ばかり` record has two distinct meanings at different JLPT levels (N4 and N2).  For greater clarity, this record should be split into two.  One record will cover the N4 meaning of "only; nothing but" and the other will cover the N2 meaning of "about; approximately".  This will make it easier for learners to understand the distinct nuances of this grammar point.
