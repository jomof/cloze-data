writeup: |-
  The grammar point `が気になる` expresses a feeling of interest or concern about something. It's formed by combining the noun `気` (ki), the particle `に` (ni), and the verb `なる` (naru, "to become"). Literally, it means "for something to become of interest/concern."

  The particle `が` marks the thing that is drawing your attention or causing you to be concerned. The translations "to be interested in" or "to be concerned about" are common.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  `が気になる` often implies a natural development of interest or worry, rather than a deliberate focus. This contrasts with `を気にする`, which suggests a more intentional act of paying attention to something because it might be bothersome or important to consider.
  *  This grammar point is used before nouns and noun-like phrases.

  - term: を気にする
    meaning: To worry about, to be bothered by
    kind: similar grammar
    nuance: Unlike `が気になる`, `を気にする` implies a more active and often negative concern. It suggests that
      the speaker is intentionally focusing on something and might be worried or bothered by it.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both `が気になる` and `を気にする` deal with attention and focus, the nuance is
  different. Use `が気になる` when something naturally draws your interest or concern. Use `を気にする` when you
  are actively paying attention to something, often because it's a source of worry or something you need
  to consider.
