  を通じて and 通して are two grammar patterns in Japanese that have very similar meanings to each other, and are used in many overlapping situations. Primarily, they can be understood as meaning "through (A), (B)" or "via (A), (B)". This "through" may indicate a method or a location. 通じる ("to flow" or "to go through") and 通す ("to make a path") differ in that the former is intransitive, while the latter is transitive. Because of this, 通じる will be seen more often regarding information or communication where (A) is the connection through which (B) occurs. 通す, on the other hand, more often refers to direct locations through which something is transferred or relocated. As this expression begins with を, it appears after nouns, before expressing in the (B) part of the sentence exactly what was done "through" (A).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The primary difference lies in the intransitive and transitive nature of the verbs. Actions done **intentionally** or **by use of (A)** tend to use 通して.
  *  を通じて is more common when something is being done **throughout (A)**, indicating a duration or a widespread effect.
