  The particle combination 「とか」 functions to quote information that has been heard, but is presented with a degree of uncertainty or lack of confirmation. Think of it as conveying “I heard something like (A)” or “(A) or something was said.” 「とか」 follows verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. This usage of 「とか」 to indicate hearsay with a casual nuance is common in everyday conversations.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  Be mindful that 「とか」 also functions as a particle for listing items, similar to 「～や～など」. While both usages stem from the combination of と and か, their specific functions differ. The listing 「とか」 connects multiple nouns, while the hearsay 「とか」 attaches to a clause or phrase.
