writeup: The particle か is commonly used to express "or" in Japanese. Interestingly, this usage is fundamentally
  the same as か's function as a question marker. Think of it as presenting possibilities. For example,
  saying "tea or coffee?" with a rising intonation in English serves a similar purpose. In Japanese, か
  after a noun or phrase presents an option. Using です or ます after each option shifts the nuance towards
  asking a formal question rather than just presenting choices, so it's often omitted in this "or" context.
examples:
  - japanese: 紅茶かコーヒー、どちらにしますか?
    english: Tea or coffee, which would you like?
    register: polite
    setting: friendly
    nuance: Using 「どちらにしますか?」 makes the sentence polite and suitable for asking someone their preference.
  - japanese: 映画を見るか、家でゆっくりするか、まだ決めていない。
    english: Whether to watch a movie or relax at home, I haven't decided yet.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The use of 「まだ決めていない」 indicates the speaker is still in the process of deciding.
  - japanese: 渋谷に行くか新宿に行くか迷うなあ。
    english: I can't decide whether to go to Shibuya or Shinjuku.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The 「なあ」 at the end is a masculine sentence-ender indicating contemplation or slight worry.
  - japanese: 好きか嫌いか、はっきり言ってよ。
    english: Tell me clearly, do you like me or not?
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The 「言ってよ」 adds a slight demanding or pleading tone, often used in casual, sometimes flirty,
      contexts. The directness of asking 「好きか嫌いか」 makes it clear the speaker wants a straightforward answer.
  - japanese: 明日、晴れか雨か、どっちでもいいよ。
    english: Tomorrow, whether it's sunny or rainy, either is fine with me.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「どっちでもいいよ」 expresses indifference or flexibility about the weather.
  - japanese: 今日は家にいるか、少し散歩に出かけるかしたいな。
    english: Today, I feel like either staying home or going for a short walk.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The 「～たいな」 ending expresses a desire or a slight hope.
  - japanese: 甘いものが食べたい気分だけど、ケーキかアイスクリームか悩むね。
    english: I'm in the mood for something sweet, but I can't decide between cake or ice cream.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The 「悩むね」 expresses the speaker's indecisiveness in a friendly way.
  - japanese: もしよかったら、今度お茶でも飲みに行かない?コーヒーか紅茶か、何か好きなものを。
    english: If you're interested, would you like to go for tea sometime? Coffee or black tea, or whatever
      you like.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「もしよかったら」 is a polite way to invite someone. 「お茶でも」 makes the invitation more casual and less
      pressure. Offering 「コーヒーか紅茶か、何か好きなものを」 shows consideration for the other person's preferences.
false_friends:
  - term: でも
    meaning: Or something, Any... (with question words), No matter (who)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「か」 which presents distinct options, 「でも」 often implies a less defined choice or can
      be used with question words to mean "any".
  - term: それとも
    meaning: Or, Or else, Rather
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「それとも」 is used to present a clear alternative, often implying a choice between two specific
      options, similar to 「か」, but it often appears at the beginning of the second option in a question.
  - term: あるいは
    meaning: Or, Possibly, Maybe, Perhaps, Or possibly
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「あるいは」 is a more formal way of saying "or" and can also convey a sense of possibility or uncertainty.
  - term: Question-phrase + か
    meaning: Including questions within sentences
    kind: similar function
    nuance: While 「か」 acts as "or" between choices, placing it after a question word (like 何か) creates
      an indefinite, like "something".
  - term: ～なり～なり
    meaning: Or, Either or
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「～なり～なり」 emphasizes the idea that either option is acceptable, often suggesting there are
      more than two possibilities or that the specific choice doesn't matter too much.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that while all these expressions relate to alternatives,
  「か」 simply connects two options. 「でも」 has broader uses, including "but". 「それとも」 is a more direct 'or'
  often used in questions. 「あるいは」 is a formal 'or' that can also mean 'maybe'. Question words with 「か」
  create indefinite pronouns. 「～なり～なり」 emphasizes the acceptability of either choice.
