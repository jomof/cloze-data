writeup: |-
  **はず** (hazu), written as 筈, conveys a strong expectation or conviction that something is true or will happen. It expresses the speaker's belief based on reason, common sense, or prior knowledge, although they lack absolute certainty. Common translations include "bound to be (A)" and "should be (A)."

  As a noun, **はず** can function in various nominal positions within a sentence. It is frequently followed by **だ** (da) or **です** (desu).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While sometimes translated as "should," **はず** indicates an expectation, not a suggestion or advice. Think of it as "it stands to reason that..." rather than "you ought to..." Therefore, "bound to" is often a more accurate translation.
  *  Omitting **だ** or **です** after **はず** softens the certainty, conveying a sense of "probably" or "I'm pretty sure." Adding **はず** to the end of a sentence similarly indicates less than 100% confidence, akin to saying **多分** (tabun - probably).

    kind: synonym

      a specific expectation in a given situation.'
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion with similar expressions, remember that **はずだ** fundamentally
  expresses a strong expectation or conviction based on reason, but without absolute certainty. It's about
  what the speaker believes is logically likely. Expressions like **べき** focus on obligation, while **つもりだ**
  focuses on intention, and **ことになっている** focuses on established arrangements. Paying attention to the
  nuance of expectation versus obligation or intention will help distinguish **はずだ** from these other
  grammar points.
