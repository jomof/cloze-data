writeup: |-
  たい is an auxiliary verb used to express what **you** want to do. It attaches to the stem form (masu-stem) of a verb. The object of the verb can be marked with either を or が. Using が emphasizes the object of desire more strongly. たい conjugates like an い-adjective, so you can use forms like たくない (don't want to), たかった (wanted to), and たくなかった (didn't want to).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  たい is primarily used to express your own desires. You can ask about someone else's desires directly, but generally, you don't use it to guess or assume what someone else wants.
  *  To express wanting someone else to do something, use ～てほしい instead.
  *  When inviting someone to do something, ～ませんか is more natural than using たい.

  adds emphasis to the object of desire.

    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「たい」, 「てほしい」 is used when you want someone else to perform an action.
  - term: がほしい
    meaning: To want something, To be in need of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「たい」, which is used for actions, 「がほしい」 is used for wanting nouns (things).
  - term: たがる
    meaning: To want to (Third person)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「たい」 which expresses your own desire, 「たがる」 is used to describe what someone else wants
      to do. It often implies noticing or pointing out someone else's desire.
  - term: がる
    meaning: To feel, To think, To act as if, To want, To desire
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「がる」 is a suffix added to adjectives or the stems of verbs to describe someone else's feelings
      or desires, similar to 「たがる」 but with broader application to feelings beyond just wanting to do
      something. It's also not used for the speaker's own feelings.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「たい」 is for your own desires to *do* something,
  「てほしい」 is for wanting someone else to *do* something, and 「がほしい」 is for wanting a *thing*. 「たがる」 and
  「がる」 are for describing other people's desires and feelings, not your own.
