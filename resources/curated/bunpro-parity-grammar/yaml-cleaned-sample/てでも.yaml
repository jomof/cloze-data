writeup: 「てでも」 is a combination of the conjunctive particle 「て」 and the adverbial particle 「でも」. It expresses
  a **strong determination** to achieve something, even if it requires significant effort, sacrifice,
  or unconventional methods. It carries the nuance of "even if I have to do (something extreme or undesirable)".
  Think of it as saying, "I'm going to do this, no matter what it takes!" or "even if I have to go to
  great lengths". Because 「てでも」 conveys a strong will, it's often found in sentences that also express
  desire or intention, such as with 「ほしい」, 「たい」, or 「ようと思う」. While 「てでも」 has a slightly informal feel
  due to the 「て」 form being used where you might expect 「ても」, the basic construction of a て-form verb
  combined with an adverbial particle is quite common for adding emphasis or comparison. For example,
  「てはいけない」 or 「てはだめ」 use this pattern.

    meaning: Even though, Even if, Even when, Also
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「にしても」 can also mean 'even if', it often carries a stronger sense of concession or surprise
      than 「てでも」's determined tone.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ようが～まいが」 and 「にしても」 can sometimes translate to similar English phrases
  as 「てでも」, it's important to consider the subtle differences in nuance. 「てでも」 is all about the speaker's
  resolve, whereas 「ようが～まいが」 focuses on indifference to the means, and 「にしても」 often expresses a surprising
  or conceded point.
