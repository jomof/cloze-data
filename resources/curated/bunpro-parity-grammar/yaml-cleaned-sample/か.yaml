writeup: か is a particle that frequently comes at the end of sentences in Japanese and functions similarly
  to a question mark in English. It indicates that the sentence is a question. While primarily used at
  the end of sentences, it's not strictly limited to that position. Beyond simply forming questions, か
  can also express uncertainty or doubt. It commonly follows the polite form of verbs and adjectives,
  such as in 「～です か」 and 「～ます か」. In casual conversation, however, か can directly follow the word the
  speaker is questioning or expressing uncertainty about. Both usages are grammatically correct, but omitting
  「です」 or 「ます」 can sound abrupt or overly familiar, and might be considered rude by some.
examples:
  - japanese: これは本ですか。
    english: Is this a book?
    register: polite
    setting: informative
    nuance: The 「です」 makes the question polite.
  - japanese: あれは田中さんの傘か。
    english: Is that Mr. Tanaka's umbrella?
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: The absence of 「です」 makes this sentence casual.
  - japanese: 明日、映画に行くか?
    english: Should we go to a movie tomorrow?
    register: casual
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The 「か」 at the end of this sentence, combined with the rising intonation, makes it a question/suggestion.
      Spoken by a male to a female in a casual setting.
  - japanese: ねえ、今日、一緒に帰らないか?
    english: Hey, won't you walk home with me today?

    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「～ないか」 is a common way for males to make suggestions or invitations in a slightly flirtatious
      or friendly way. The 「ねえ」 at the beginning softens the question and adds a touch of intimacy.
  - japanese: 本当にそれでいいんですか。
    english: Is that really okay with you?
    register: polite
    setting: cautious
    nuance: The 「んですか」 adds a nuance of seeking confirmation and shows more consideration for the listener's
      feelings. The 「です」 makes it polite.
