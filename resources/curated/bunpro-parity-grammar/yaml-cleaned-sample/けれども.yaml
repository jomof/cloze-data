writeup: |-
  けれども is the more formal (full version) of the conjunction particle けど. Like けど, it generally conveys the meaning of "but," but its formality lends a slightly more nuanced sense of "although" or "even though." It emphasizes that "while considering (A), (B)"—highlighting the importance or need to consider the (B) phrase. As demonstrated in the examples, when using this conjunction after a な-adjective or a noun, だ is required. For reference, the forms of "but" in Japanese, ranging from most casual to most formal, are: けど - けども - けれど - けれども - が.

  **Fun Fact:** Originally, けれども was considered a more feminine version of が. However, the modern けど is now so prevalent that けれども has lost its former feminine connotation.

  **Important Consideration:** Similar to けど (and other forms of "but" in Japanese), the clause following けれども is often omitted if it's obvious or the speaker chooses not to state it directly.
examples:
  - japanese: もう晩ご飯を食たべたけれども。
    english: I already ate dinner, but… (There's always room for dessert!)
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The trailing off with 「けれども。」 suggests an unspoken continuation, hinting at a desire for something
      else, perhaps dessert. This is a common, casual way to imply something without stating it directly.
  - japanese: この本ほんは面白おもしろくないけれども、あなたなら好すきかもしれませんね。
    english: I don't find this book interesting, but you might like it.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Using 「かもしれませんね」 adds a touch of politeness and speculation, making the statement less assertive.
      「あなたなら」 suggests the speaker recognizes the listener's different taste.
  - japanese: 昨日きのう、彼かれに伝つたえたけれども、彼かれは忘わすれてしまった。
    english: Although I told him yesterday, he forgot.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「けれども」 here sounds slightly more formal than 「けど」, fitting for a straightforward
      recounting of events. 「しまった」 expresses a sense of disappointment or completion regarding the forgetting.
  - japanese: 部屋へやを掃除そうじしたけれども、まだ全然ぜんぜん綺麗きれいじゃない。
    english: I cleaned the room, but it's still not clean at all.
    register: casual
    setting: slightly melancholic
    nuance: 「全然きれいじゃない」 emphasizes the lack of cleanliness, adding a negative emotional tone. The casual
      register is reflected in the use of 「じゃない」.
  - japanese: あなたと一緒いっしょにいるのは楽たのしいけれども、そろそろ帰かえらないと。
    english: Being with you is fun, but I should probably head home soon.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「そろそろ帰らないと」 is a common way to politely end an interaction. Using 「けれども」 softens the need
      to leave, expressing enjoyment despite the departure. The slightly polite tone is suitable for a
      first-date scenario.
  - japanese: 君きみといる時間じかんは楽たのしいけれども、もっと近ちかくに寄よってもいいかな?
    english: Spending time with you is fun, but would it be alright if I got a little closer?
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「もっと近くに寄ってもいいかな?」 is a direct yet polite way of expressing a desire for closeness.
      Using 「けれども」 acknowledges the pleasant present but smoothly transitions to expressing a flirtatious
      interest. The use of 「かな」 softens the request.
  - japanese: この店みせの雰囲気ふんいきは悪わるくないけれども、値段ねだんが少すこし高すぎる。
    english: The atmosphere of this restaurant isn't bad, but the prices are a bit too high.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「悪くない」 is a polite way of saying something is okay. 「少し高すぎる」 expresses a mild complaint about
      the price. The overall tone is balanced and observational.
  - japanese: あの映画えいがは面白おもしろかったけれども、ちょっと長ながかったと思おもう。
    english: That movie was interesting, but I thought it was a bit long.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「面白かった」 is a straightforward positive comment. 「ちょっと長かったと思う」 offers a mild criticism. The
      use of 「思う」 softens the opinion.
  - japanese: このプロジェクトは大変たいへんだけれども、やりがいがある。
    english: This project is tough, but it's rewarding.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: While the input example used 「けれども」, the more common 「だけれども」 is used here, retaining the formal
      nuance but sounding slightly more natural in this context. 「やりがいがある」 emphasizes the positive aspect
      despite the difficulty, suitable for a professional setting.
  - japanese: 雨あめは止やんだけれども、まだ道みちは濡ぬれている。
    english: Although the rain has stopped, the roads are still wet.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This is a straightforward statement of facts. 「けれども」 clearly connects the cessation of rain
      with the continued wetness of the roads in a slightly formal manner.
post_example_writeup: Remember that while けれども is more formal, it functions similarly to けど. The choice
  between them often depends on the context and the desired level of politeness. In casual conversation,
  けど is far more common.
false_friends:
  - term: が (subject marker)
    meaning: But, However
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While が can also mean "but" or "however," it often has a stronger sense of contrast than けれども.
      が can also function as a subject marker, which けれども cannot.
  - term: けど・だけど
    meaning: But, However
    kind: synonym
    nuance: けど and だけど are more casual equivalents of けれども. They are used much more frequently in everyday
      conversation.
  - term: だが・ですが
    meaning: But, Still, However, Nevertheless
    kind: synonym
    nuance: だが and ですが carry a slightly more assertive or explanatory nuance than けれども. They are often
      used to introduce a contrasting point or explanation.
  - term: ものの
    meaning: Although, But, Even Though
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ものの has a stronger emphasis on the unexpectedness or surprising nature of the second clause
      in contrast to the first, which is a nuance less prominent in けれども.
  - term: ところが
    meaning: Even so, However, Even though, But
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ところが often introduces a result that is contrary to expectation based on the first clause.
      It carries a sense of surprise or a shift in the situation, which is not a primary function of けれども.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, consider the level of formality required in your communication.
  For casual settings, けど or だけど are usually appropriate. When a stronger sense of contrast or a surprising
  outcome is intended, が, だが, ですが, or ところが might be more suitable. ものの emphasizes unexpectedness. けれども
  is a good choice for more formal situations where a polite but is needed.
