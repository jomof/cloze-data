writeup: The grammar point 「てもらう」 expresses receiving an action from someone. It translates to "to get
  someone to do" or "to have someone do" something for you. The person performing the action is marked
  with the particle に, while the receiver of the action is marked with が or は. Unlike 「てくれる」, which implies
  the action is a favor done *for* the speaker, 「てもらう」 focuses on the act of *receiving* the action. Therefore,
  when you receive a service, 「てもらう」 is more appropriate as 「てくれる」 can sound like the service provider
  is doing you a personal favor. Literally, 「てもらう」 means "to receive the action of."

post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse 「てもらう」 with these similar expressions. 「てあげる」 is
  when you do something for someone, while 「てもらう」 is when someone does something for you. 「てくれる」 also
  means someone does something for you, but it has a stronger nuance of them doing you a favor. 「ていただけませんか」
  is a polite request, not a statement about receiving an action.
