  Just like in other grammar points that include the う-Verb 至る 'to result in', or 'to reach a climax', に至って will indicate (A) as an extreme extent from which (B) results. The case marking particle に will mark either a verb or noun as the extent that 至る is signifying as being extreme. Common translations include "only when (A), did (B)", and "going as far as to (A), (B)". The extreme extent that に至って implies will often be the result of something that has been left far too long in a certain state. Due to this, に至って is often used in relation to criticism of a lack of action. As with many other grammar structures that use verbs, occasionally the formal conjunctive 至り will replace the standard て-form 至って. **Important Consideration**: に至って and に至っても have quite different meanings. The primary thing to be aware of is as follows:

  - (A)に至って(B) - Only when reaching the extreme of (A) did (B) occur.
  - (A)に至っても(B) - Even if reaching the extreme of (A), (B) won't occur.

  に至っても will be covered in its own grammar point.
