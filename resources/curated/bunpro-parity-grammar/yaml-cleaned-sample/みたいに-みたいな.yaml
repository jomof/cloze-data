  As we discussed in the lesson about **みたい**, it functions as a な-adjective. This means it can modify both nouns and verbs, conveying the meaning of "like (A)" or "resembling (A)". The distinction between **みたいに** and **みたいな** lies in what they modify: **みたいに** is an adverbial form that modifies verbs, while **みたいな** is an adjectival form that modifies nouns.

  Think of it this way: if you want to say something *acts* like something else, you'll use **みたいに**. If you want to describe a *thing* as being like something else, you'll use **みたいな**.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The element being compared (B) doesn't always immediately follow **みたいに** or **みたいな**. Pay attention to the grammatical structure of the sentence to identify what is being described as similar.
  *  Be careful not to confuse **みたい** with **見たい** (to want to see). While **みたい** often relates to visual resemblance, it doesn't have a kanji form and therefore won't be written as **見たい** in this context.
