writeup: The grammar point **とても～ない** expresses a strong sense of impossibility. It's used with negative
  verb forms to convey that something is absolutely not possible or cannot be done. The **とても** here emphasizes
  the impossibility. While often used with the potential form of verbs (e.g., 理解できない - cannot understand),
  it can be used with other verbs as long as the context implies impossibility. The key is that the speaker
  feels a strong sense of **impossibility** regarding the action.
examples:
  - japanese: その考(かんが)え方(かた)はとても理解(りかい)できない。
    english: I cannot understand that way of thinking at all.
    register: standard
    setting: informative
    nuance: The sentence 「とても理解できない」 uses 「できない」, the negative potential form of 「理解する」, emphasizing the
      speaker's inability to understand the concept.
  - japanese: 彼(かれ)はいつも嘘(うそ)ばかり言(い)うから、彼(かれ)の言(い)う事(こと)はとても信(しん)じられない。
    english: He always just lies, so I cannot trust what he says at all.
    register: standard
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「信じられない」 is the negative potential form of 「信じる」. The speaker expresses a strong inability
      to trust the person due to their lying habit.
  - japanese: 彼(かれ)に子供(こども)ができたの！?彼(かれ)が親(おや)になることを想像(そうぞう)するのはとても無理(むり)だ。
    english: He has a baby coming? I cannot imagine him becoming a parent at all.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    nuance: 「無理だ」 means 'impossible'. The speaker finds it completely impossible to imagine the person
      as a parent.
  - japanese: どこの航空会社(こうくうがいしゃ)も今(いま)はチケットを売(う)っていないから、旅行(りょこう)をするのがとても無理(むり)だ。
    english: No airline company is selling airline tickets, so it is not possible to travel at all.
    register: standard

      of tickets.
  - japanese: そんなこと、とてもできないよ。
    english: I absolutely cannot do something like that.
    register: casual
    setting: emphatic
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The 「よ」 at the end of the sentence is a masculine sentence-ending particle, adding emphasis
      to the speaker's statement of impossibility. 「できない」 is the negative potential form.
  - japanese: こんなにたくさんの料理(りょうり)、とても食(た)べられないわ。
    english: I can't eat this much food at all.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The 「わ」 at the end is a feminine sentence-ending particle, softening the statement while still
      expressing impossibility. 「食べられない」 is the negative potential form.
  - japanese: 君(きみ)の美(うつく)しさは、とても言葉(ことば)では言い表(あらわ)せない。
    english: Your beauty is such that I cannot express it in words at all.
    register: flirty
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「言い表せない」 is the negative potential form, conveying that the speaker's vocabulary is insufficient
      to capture the listener's beauty. This is a classic flirty remark.
  - japanese: 今夜(こんや)は楽(たの)しかったね。でも、疲(つか)れたから、もうとても歩(ある)けない。

    register: first-date
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「歩けない」 is the negative potential form. This sentence smoothly transitions from a positive
      statement about the evening to a gentle indication that the speaker needs to go home, a common scenario
      on a first date.
  - japanese: 締(し)め切(き)りまであと３０分(ぷん)しかないのに、この量(りょう)のレポートをとても書(か)き終(お)われない。
    english: With only 30 minutes until the deadline, there's no way I can finish writing this amount
      of report.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「書き終われない」 is the negative potential form of 「書き終える」. The speaker emphasizes the impossibility
      of completing the task within the limited time.
post_example_writeup: Notice how 「とても」 intensifies the negative meaning. It's not just that something
  is not possible, but that it's *absolutely* not possible.
false_friends:
  - term: ぜんぜん
    meaning: (Not) at all
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「とても～ない」, 「ぜんぜん」 can be used with both negative and positive sentences (although less
      common with positive). 「ぜんぜん大丈夫です」 (It's totally okay) is a valid usage, while 「とても大丈夫です」 is not.
  - term: 全(まった)く～ない
    meaning: Not~at all
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「ぜんぜん」, 「全く～ない」 can also be used for emphasis in negative sentences. However, 「とても～ない」
      carries a stronger nuance of impossibility compared to 「全く～ない」 which can sometimes just mean 'not
      at all' without the same level of impossibility.
  - term: 少(すこ)しも～ない
    meaning: Not even a little, Not at all, Not in the least, Never
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「少しも～ない」 emphasizes the lack of even a small degree of something. While similar to 「とても～ない」
      in expressing a negative, 「とても～ない」 focuses specifically on the impossibility of an action, while
      「少しも～ない」 can apply to various aspects.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ぜんぜん」、「全く～ない」、and 「少しも～ない」 can often be used in similar contexts to
  「とても～ない」 to express a negative, remember that 「とても～ない」 specifically highlights the speaker's feeling
  of impossibility regarding an action. The others have broader applications. Be mindful of the slight
  difference in nuance when choosing between these expressions.
