  「に加えて」 is a formal Japanese grammar pattern that combines the particle 「に」 with the て-form of the verb 「加える」(くわえる), meaning "to add". It is used to express the idea of adding one thing to another, often emphasizing that the second item is an additional point or factor. It translates to phrases like "in addition to", "not only...but also", or "not to mention".

  You can use 「に加えて」 by placing it directly after the noun you are adding to. For example, 「名前に加えて住所もお願いします」(In addition to your name, please also provide your address).

  Both the kanji (に加えて) and hiragana (にくわえて) forms are common. The more formal conjunctive form, 「に加え」, is also frequently seen.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  「に加えて」 often highlights that the second item amplifies or reinforces the first. This amplification can be either positive or negative. For instance, 「暑さに加えて湿度も高い」 (In addition to the heat, the humidity is also high) describes an increasingly uncomfortable situation.
  *  While similar to other expressions like 「はもちろん」 and 「ばかりでなく」, 「に加えて」 tends to have a more formal tone.
examples:
  - japanese: 今日は暑さに加えて湿度も高くなる恐れがあるので外に出る方は熱中症に気をつけてください。
    english: Today, in addition to the heat, there is a threat of high humidity, so please be careful
      of heatstroke if you are planning to leave the house.
