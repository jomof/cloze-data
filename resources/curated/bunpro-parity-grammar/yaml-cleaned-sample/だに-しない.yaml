writeup: |-
  だに is an adverbial particle that shares a similar meaning to さえ and すら "even", but is more commonly found in classical literature. It is paired with negative structures and presents "minimum" or "light" examples to which (A) does not apply, and therefore obviously also does not apply to anything greater than (A). It can be translated as "not even (A), so not (B)", or "not (B) at all". だに typically follows nouns or noun-phrases.

  Although だに often appears when the (B) part of a sentence is negative, だに itself is not limited to being used this way. When following verbs, and the (B) phrase is not negative, だに simply means "just". It's important to remember that the core meaning of this adverbial particle is to mark the word or phrase before it as an extremely small amount or lower limit.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  だに is only used in a very limited set of expressions in modern Japanese.
  *  Common expressions include:
  *  夢にだに "even in a dream"
  *  想像するだに "even in my imagination"
  *  考えるだに "even to consider"
  *  聞くだに "even hearing"
  *  微動だに "not even a quiver"
