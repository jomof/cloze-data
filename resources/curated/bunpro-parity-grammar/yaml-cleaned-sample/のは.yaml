writeup: 「のは」 is a particle combination used to **nominalize verbs and phrases**. It functions similarly
  to "the fact that," "the one who," or "that which" in English. Essentially, it turns a verb or a clause
  into a noun, allowing it to function as the subject or object of a sentence. The 「の」 acts as the nominalizer,
  and 「は」 acts as the topic marker, highlighting the nominalized phrase. This construction can follow
  verbs in their plain form (dictionary form, past tense, negative, etc.). However, it cannot be used
  with the polite forms 「ます」 or 「ません」 directly. Be careful not to confuse 「の」 in this context with the
  possessive particle 「の」 or the explanatory 「の」 (as in 「～のです」). Also, note that 「のは」 is distinct from
  「こと」, although both can nominalize verbs; 「こと」 is often used in more abstract contexts or with certain
  expressions.
examples:
  - japanese: 私がお弁当を作った**のは**昨日です。
    english: The time I made the lunchbox was yesterday.
    register: standard
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「私がお弁当を作った」 is nominalized by 「のは」 and becomes the topic of the sentence, with 「昨日です」 providing
      further information.
  - japanese: 彼女が選んだ**のは**この花束です。
    english: The one she chose is this bouquet.
    register: standard
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「彼女が選んだ」 is nominalized by 「のは」, focusing on the specific bouquet she selected.
  - japanese: 君がいつも僕を笑顔にする**のは**、その優しい言葉だよ。
    english: The thing that always makes me smile is your kind words.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「君がいつも僕を笑顔にする」 is nominalized by 「のは」, directly expressing what makes the speaker happy. The
      use of 「だよ」 adds a casual and slightly emphatic tone.
  - japanese: 僕が初めて君に会った**のは**、このカフェだったね。
    english: The place I first met you was this cafe, wasn't it?
    register: casual
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「僕が初めて君に会った」 is nominalized by 「のは」, reminiscing about their first encounter. The 「ね」 seeks
      confirmation and shared feeling.
  - japanese: 山田さんが発表で一番伝えたかった**のは**、このデータの重要性です。
    english: What Mr. Yamada most wanted to convey in his presentation was the importance of this data.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「山田さんが発表で一番伝えたかった」 is nominalized by 「のは」, making it the subject of the sentence in a professional
      context. The politeness level is maintained through 「さん」 and the overall structure.
  - japanese: 多くの人が反対している**のは**、その計画の実現可能性についてです。
    english: What many people are against is the feasibility of that plan.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「多くの人が反対している」 is nominalized by 「のは」, identifying the core issue of disagreement. This sentence
      is suitable for discussions on serious topics.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in the examples, 「のは」 is versatile and can be used in various contexts,
  from casual conversations to formal presentations. Pay attention to the nuance it adds by focusing on
  the nominalized phrase as the topic.

  - term: の (possession)
    meaning: Indicates possession
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「のは」, the possessive 「の」 directly connects nouns to show ownership or affiliation (e.g.,
      「私の本」 - my book).
  - term: は
    meaning: As for... (Highlights sentence topic)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「は」 marks the topic, it doesn't inherently nominalize a verb like 「のは」 does. 「は」 can
      mark nouns, adjectives, or even entire clauses as the topic.
  - term: こと
    meaning: Converting a verb into a noun
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both nominalize verbs, 「こと」 is often used for more abstract concepts or in set expressions,
      whereas 「のは」 often introduces a specific fact or instance.
  - term: Adjective + の(は)
    meaning: The 'one' that... (Indefinite pronoun, Adjective nominalization)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: When used with adjectives, 「の」 (often followed by 「は」) acts as an indefinite pronoun, meaning
      "the one that is [adjective]", whereas 「のは」 nominalizes verbs.
  - term: Particle + の
    meaning: Combined particles
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「の」 can also be part of other particle combinations like 「ための」 (for the sake of) or 「あとの」
      (after doing), which have different functions than the nominalizing 「のは」.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「のは」 specifically nominalizes verbs and
  verb phrases, making them the topic of the sentence. Distinguish it from the possessive 「の」, the general
  topic marker 「は」, the more abstract nominalizer 「こと」, and other particle combinations involving 「の」.
  Context is key to understanding the function of 「の」.
