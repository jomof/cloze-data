  **る-Verbs**, also known as **Ichidan verbs** (一段), are a category of Japanese verbs characterized by their simple conjugation pattern. The term 一段, meaning "one level," refers to the fact that only the ending changes during conjugation. Specifically, the final 「る」 is replaced depending on the desired tense or politeness level.

  One of the most common conjugations is the polite ます form. To create the ます form, you simply remove the 「る」 from the dictionary form and add 「ます」.

  The dictionary form, ending in 「る」, is also referred to as the "plain form," "casual form," or "short form."

  **Important Consideration:** While all る-verbs end in 「る」, not all verbs ending in 「る」 are る-verbs. You can identify non-る-verbs by observing that the 「る」 changes to another mora instead of simply being dropped during conjugation. For example, the verb 「取る」(to take) becomes 「取ります」. The 「る」 changes to 「り」, indicating it's not a る-verb but a **う-verb** (Godan verb). With true る-verbs, the 「る」 is simply removed.

    english: I will take that too.

  in various situations.

  - term: う-Verb (Dictionary)
    meaning: う + ます (Godan Verbs)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike る-verbs, う-verbs have a more complex conjugation pattern where the final う sound changes
      before adding ます.
  - term: る-Verb (Negative)
    meaning: Will/Does/Do (not)
    kind: conjugation
    nuance: This is a conjugated form of the る-verb, indicating the negative plain present tense. The
      dictionary form is the base, non-conjugated form.
  - term: う-Verb (Past)
    meaning: う - Verbs (Past tense)
    kind: conjugation
    nuance: This refers to the past tense conjugation of う-verbs, which follows a different set of rules

  - term: Verb + て
    meaning: And, Then (Linking events)
    kind: grammar
    nuance: While the te-form of a る-verb is created by dropping る and adding て, this grammar point focuses
      on the dictionary form itself and its relation to the ます form.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that the dictionary form is the basic form of
  the verb ending in 「る」. When conjugating, る-verbs simply drop the 「る」 to form various tenses and politeness
  levels, whereas う-verbs undergo a sound change before adding suffixes like 「ます」.
