  を込めて, or を込めて when appearing in its kanji form, is a phrase that expresses when something is "full of (A)", or "filled with (A)". The structure comprises を and the te-form of the る-verb 込める, which means "to pack into" or "to load with". The literal meaning aligns well with the standard English translations. を込めて appears directly after the noun expressing the particular feeling or emotion being discussed.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  This structure is treated as a **set phrase**.
  *  It's primarily used when a particular **feeling or emotion** is what's being "packed into" something.
