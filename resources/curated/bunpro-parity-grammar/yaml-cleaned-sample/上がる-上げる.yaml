writeup: |-
  When used after the conjunctive form of a verb, either of the verbs **上げる** "to raise", or **上がる** "to rise" may be used. They will convey that something has been done "to the limit". **上がる** will be used for actions that take place by themselves (intransitive), while **上げる** will be used for actions that have an instigator (transitive).

  Although **上げる** and **上がる** show that something has been done "to the limit", the nuance is usually "to do (A) to the point of completion", or "to do (A) through to the end". Therefore, the "limit" that is being highlighted is usually a natural ending, and not due to running out of some kind of resource.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Result/Product Focus:** **上げる** and **上がる** are most commonly used when some kind of effect or product is produced as a result of the (A) action. In these cases, the literal meaning of "to (A) up" is very similar to "to finish up (A)" in English.
  *  **仕上がる (shiagaru):** Be cautious; **仕上がる** is a very common expression that is used for many things. Usually it conveys that something has been completed after some involved or time-consuming process.

    kind: synonym

post_false_friends_writeup: While 「おわる」, 「てしまう・ちゃう」, 「切る」, and 「抜く」 can also express the idea of completion,
  it's important to note the subtle differences. 「おわる」 is a basic and neutral way to say something ends.
  「てしまう・ちゃう」 often implies something unintentional or regrettable. 「切る」 suggests a forceful or decisive
  finish. 「抜く」 implies doing something thoroughly. 「上がる・上げる」 specifically highlight the natural completion
  of a process, often resulting in something tangible.
