  When paired with the conjunctive form of い-Adjectives, **くもなんともない** is often translated as "not (A) or anything", or "definitely not (A)". This is a combination of the adverbial particle **も** and the adverb **何ともない** "doesn't amount to anything". **なんともない** is often grouped with other negative structures in order to show that the thing it is linked to is not a large amount or considerable extent.

  In many cases, **何ともない** illustrates that the extent of the thing that it follows is not sufficient to cause a problem. Because of this, **～くもなんともない** will often be used in sentences where (A) is something that could potentially be an issue, but the speaker is expressing that it has not reached that point, or does not go that far. Because of this, **～くもなんともない** is frequently used with adjectives that describe sensations or emotions.

  **Caution:** This structure is also commonly used with the auxiliary adjective **たい**, for showing that someone "doesn't want to do (A)".
