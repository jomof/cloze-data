  When combined with nouns, the expression 中心に indicates that something is being "focused on" or "centered around". Occasionally, it may also be translated simply as "mainly (A)" or "most notably (A)". 中心 itself is a noun that expresses the "pivot" or "central focus point" from which something else is occurring. The case-marking particle に just marks '(A)を中心に' as the target that is being focused on.

  Due to 中心 itself marking a "central point", it may also be used just to express the middle of something, rather than something that is being concentrated or focused on.

  By adding する in either its dictionary or past forms, 中心にする or 中心にした may appear before another noun. This will highlight the noun that comes after as being the overall thing through which the "focus on (A)" is taking place.

  Additionally, the case-marking particle と may sometimes replace に. This change will put more nuance on the focus point being conclusive, rather than progressive or decisive.

  or activity. Use ばかり when something is exclusively the case, and が主に when emphasizing the largest part
  or quantity.
