  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
writeup: Although often considered a standalone adverb, 必ずしも is a combination of the adverb 必ず "invariably"
  or "certainly", and the adverbial particles し and も. し and も are frequently combined to strengthen the
  meaning of the word preceding them. Therefore, 必ずしも might seem to translate to something like "absolutely
  certainly." However, it's crucial to remember that 必ずしも is exclusively used in negative sentences. Consequently,
  it's commonly translated as "not always (A)," "not entirely (A)," or "not necessarily (A)." Think of
  the literal meaning as closer to "not absolutely certainly (A)." 必ずしも is typically placed at the beginning
  of a phrase, before expressing something that isn't 100% certain.

post_example_writeup: Remember that 必ずしも always pairs with a negative ending. The negative can take various
  forms, such as わけではない, とは限らない, or とは言えない. The choice often depends on the nuance you wish to convey
  and the level of formality.
false_friends:
  - term: とは限らない
    meaning: Not necessarily so, Is not always true, There is no guarantee that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar in meaning, 「とは限らない」 often expresses a lack of certainty or guarantee about
      a specific situation, whereas 「必ずしも」 focuses on refuting a universal claim or expectation. 「必ずしも」
      is slightly more formal.
  - term: というものでもない
    meaning: There is no guarantee that…, Not necessarily
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「というものでもない」 emphasizes that something isn't the *only* possibility or the *only* way things
      are. It's used to soften statements or offer alternatives, while 「必ずしも」 directly denies a universal
      truth.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing these up, consider the specific nuance you want to convey.
  Use 必ずしも when you want to state that something is not always the case. Use とは限らない when you're expressing
  doubt or uncertainty about something being true in a particular instance. Use というものでもない when you want
  to suggest that there are other possibilities or ways of thinking.
