  おかげで (or お陰で in kanji) is an expression used to express thanks or acknowledge a positive outcome that resulted from someone or something. It translates to "thanks to (A)" or "because of (A)". It consists of the polite prefix お-, the noun 陰 ("shade"), and the case-marking particle で. Literally, お陰で means "in the shade of (A)", implying that (B) was made possible because (A) provided a favorable condition or support.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  おかげで is used when the outcome is generally **positive** or desirable.
  *  It can follow any word in its attributive form (plain form for verbs and i-adjectives, na-adjective + な, noun + の).
  *  Be aware that おかげで can also be used **sarcastically**, similar to how "thanks to (A)" can be used in English to express annoyance. The context and tone of voice will usually make this clear.
  *  おかげで can also be used at the **beginning** of a sentence, similar to "thankfully" or "luckily", indicating that a positive outcome occurred despite potential negative alternatives.

  - term: せいで
    meaning: Because of, Due to, Blame
    kind: synonym
    nuance: せいで is used exclusively for negative outcomes and carries a sense of blame or fault, the opposite
      of the gratitude implied by おかげで.

    meaning: For that reason, Because of that, To that end
    kind: synonym
    nuance: そのため(に) indicates a logical consequence or purpose. While it can describe the cause of an
      event, it doesn't inherently express gratitude like おかげで.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that おかげで specifically carries a nuance of thanks
  or acknowledgement of a positive cause. If the outcome is negative and you want to express blame, use
  せいで. For neutral causal relationships, ために or そのため(に) are more appropriate. につき is best suited for formal
  explanations or per-item descriptions.
