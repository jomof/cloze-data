  「来る (くる)」 is one of the two main irregular verbs in Japanese, the other being 「する」. It means **"to come"** or **"to be coming."** When indicating the destination, 「来る」 is typically used with the particles 「に」 or 「へ」. Unlike regular verbs, 「来る」 conjugates irregularly, specifically as a *k*-column irregular verb. This means the final 「る」 is dropped during conjugation, and the preceding 「く」 changes based on the form. For instance, the past tense is 「きた」, the dictionary form is 「くる」, and the negative plain form is 「こない」.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  「来ている (きている)」 can mean either "to be somewhere that one has come" or "to be coming." The precise meaning often depends on the context. 「来ている」 emphasizes the state of being at a location after arriving, or the ongoing action of coming.
  *  Be cautious with 「来ている」. When used to describe someone being at a location, it's generally for places people visit temporarily. It's usually not used for being at your own home or workplace.
examples:
  - japanese: 明日、そちらにうかがいます。もしよかったら、午後３時ごろにお邪魔してもいいですか?
    english: I will come to your place tomorrow. If it's alright with you, may I visit around 3 PM?
    conjugation: polite (non-past)
    register: polite
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker uses the polite verb 「うかがいます」 (humble form of 「行く」 and 「来る」) to show respect to
      the listener. The phrase 「もしよかったら」 is a common way to politely ask for permission.
    etymology: 「伺う（うかがう）」 is the humble form of 「行く」, 「来る」, and 「聞く」.

  - term: へいく
    meaning: To go to, To head toward
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「くる」 (to come towards the speaker or a defined point), 「へいく」 means to go away from
      the speaker.
  - term: てくる
    meaning: To come to, To become, To continue, To be starting to, Has been ~ing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「てくる」 can indicate movement towards the speaker, it also has broader uses indicating
      a change over time or the continuation of an action. 「くる」 focuses specifically on the act of coming.
  - term: いらっしゃる
    meaning: To be (Honorific), To come (Honorific), To go (Honorific)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike the neutral 「くる」, 「いらっしゃる」 is a highly honorific verb used when referring to the movements
      of someone of higher status.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「へいく」, 「てくる」, and 「いらっしゃる」 can sometimes be translated as "to come"
  in English, they have distinct nuances in Japanese. 「へいく」 indicates movement away, 「てくる」 has broader
  implications beyond just coming, and 「いらっしゃる」 is an honorific form. Choosing the correct verb depends
  on the direction of movement and the social context.
