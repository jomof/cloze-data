writeup: かろう is an older, somewhat archaic grammar pattern derived from the indeterminate form of an い-Adjective
  (かろ) combined with the auxiliary verb う. In modern Japanese, this is equivalent to combining an い-adjective
  with でしょう. For example, いい + でしょう becomes よかろう. It expresses agreement or volition, similar to だろう and
  でしょう, but is primarily found in dramas, anime, and historical contexts. To form this, replace the final
  い of the い-adjective with かろう. The combination of ない (which functions grammatically as an い-adjective)
  and かろう is also relatively common, conjugating as なかろう. This construction is often used by elderly characters
  or those in positions of authority, even in modern media.

      somewhat old-fashioned inquiry.
