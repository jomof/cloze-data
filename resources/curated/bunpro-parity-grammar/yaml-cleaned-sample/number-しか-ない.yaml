  The adverbial particle しか is often compared to だけ, in that it also expresses "only". However, unlike だけ, しか can only be used in negative statements. Due to this, しか～ない is regularly translated as "there's only (A)", or "there's nothing but (A)". しか～ない may be used to express numbers or nouns. In this lesson, we will examine numbers. To use this construction, the number that you want to express as being "all that exists" will go before しか, then しか will be followed by a verb in its ない or ありません form.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The main difference between しか and だけ is that だけ suggests that (A) was "chosen" from among a group where several other choices exist. しか, on the other hand, implies that there are no other choices, and (A) is the only possibility/thing that exists.
  *  When using しか, the verb that follows it **must** be in the negative form.

post_example_writeup: Remember that the verb following しか must be in the negative form. This is the key
  difference between しか and だけ.
false_friends:
  - term: だけ
    meaning: Only, just
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「しか〜ない」, 「だけ」 can be used with positive verb forms. 「だけ」 simply limits the scope, while
      「しか〜ない」 implies a sense of limitation or insufficiency.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing しか and だけ, remember that しか always requires a negative
  verb ending, whereas だけ does not have this restriction. Consider whether you want to simply state a
  limit (だけ) or emphasize the limited nature of something (しか～ない).
