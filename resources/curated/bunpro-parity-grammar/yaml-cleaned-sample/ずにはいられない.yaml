  As mentioned in our ずに lesson, ず is an auxiliary verb that is not commonly used in modern Japanese, except in set expressions. It has the equivalent role of ない, in expressing that something "has not" or "will not" happen. The case marking particle に is then combined with the adverbial particle は and the negative-potential form of いる, いられない. ずにはいられない may be translated as "cannot help doing (A)" or "cannot resist doing (A)." ずにはいられない will be attached to the indeterminate form of verbs. This is the same stem form that ない uses.

  Although ずにはいられない is often translated as "cannot resist (A)," the literal meaning is simply "cannot be without (A)."

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  The modern indeterminate form of する has several different forms, so care will need to be taken when conjugating する verbs. While ない joins with し to create しない, ず will join with せ to create せず.

  - term: ないわけにはいかない
    meaning: Can't not, no way to avoid
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ずにはいられない」 which expresses an inability to resist an action due to feeling or impulse,
      「ないわけにはいかない」 indicates an obligation or necessity. For example, 「行かないわけにはいかない」 means 'I have no
      choice but to go'.
  - term: てしょうがない
    meaning: Extremely, very, really, it can't be helped
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both can express a strong feeling, 「てしょうがない」 often focuses on a feeling that is overwhelming
      or difficult to control, but not necessarily an action you can't resist. For example, 「寂しくてしょうがない」
      means 'I'm so lonely'.
  - term: ずに
    meaning: Without doing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ずに」 simply means 'without doing'. It describes an action that was not performed, while 「ずにはいられない」
      describes an action that one cannot help but perform. For example, 「朝食を食べずに来た」 means 'I came without
      eating breakfast'.
  - term: てたまらない
    meaning: Can't help but want to, very, extremely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「てたまらない」 specifically expresses an overwhelming desire or feeling. While it can sometimes
      overlap in meaning, 「ずにはいられない」 focuses more on the inability to stop oneself from doing something,
      not just the desire. For example, 「彼女に会いたくてたまらない」 means 'I can't help but want to see her'.
  - term: ないではいられない
    meaning: Cannot help doing something, cannot resist doing something
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ないではいられない」 is very similar in meaning to 「ずにはいられない」 and can often be used interchangeably.
      However, 「ずにはいられない」 might carry a slightly stronger nuance of inevitability or being beyond one's
      control.
  - term: てならない
    meaning: Very, extremely, can't help but do
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「てならない」 often expresses a natural feeling or intuition. While it can sometimes indicate an
      action one can't help but do, it also describes strong emotions or beliefs. For example, 「彼の成功が嬉しいくてならない」
      means 'I can't help but feel happy about his success'.
  - term: ざるを得ない
    meaning: Can't help doing, have no choice but
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ざるを得ない」 emphasizes that there is no other option or choice but to do something, often due
      to external circumstances. 「ずにはいられない」 emphasizes an internal feeling or impulse. For example, 「雨なので、傘を持たざるを得ない」
      means 'Because it's raining, I have no choice but to bring an umbrella'.
  - term: わけにはいかない
    meaning: Cannot afford to, no way, impossible to do
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「わけにはいかない」 indicates that it's impossible or inappropriate to do something, often due to social
      or moral reasons. 「ずにはいられない」 is about an internal compulsion. For example, 「約束を破るわけにはいかない」 means
      'I can't afford to break my promise'.
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share some overlap in meaning with 「ずにはいられない」, it's
  important to consider the nuances. 「ないわけにはいかない」 and 「ざるを得ない」 emphasize obligation, 「てしょうがない」 and 「てたまらない」
  highlight the intensity of feeling, 「ずに」 simply means 'without doing', 「てならない」 often relates to natural
  feelings, and 「わけにはいかない」 signifies impossibility or inappropriateness. Paying attention to these differences
  will help you choose the most accurate expression.
