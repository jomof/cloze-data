writeup: '**あるいは** (aruiwa) is a Japanese conjunction used to present alternatives or possibilities. It
  carries a more formal tone compared to a simple **か** (ka). While often translated as "or", it can also
  convey nuances of "possibly", "maybe", or "perhaps". It''s frequently used after a phrase ending with
  the particle **か**, indicating a presented option. Etymologically, **あるいは** comes from **或る** (aru),
  meaning "a certain", combined with **いは** (iwa), an old adverbial particle. This origin suggests the
  meaning of "a certain possibility" or "another possibility". It''s important to note its use in more
  formal settings and written Japanese.'
etymology: The term **あるいは** is derived from the older Japanese phrase **或いは** (aruhiwa). **或る** (aru)
  means "a certain", and **は** (wa) is a topic marker. The **い** (i) is a conjunctive particle. Therefore,
  the literal sense is something like "as for a certain thing/possibility", evolving into its current
  meaning of presenting an alternative or possibility.

false_friends:
  - term: か (question)
    meaning: Or
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While **か** is a common way to express "or", it's generally less formal than **あるいは**. **か**
      can also be used to form questions, which **あるいは** cannot.
  - term: もしかしたら
    meaning: Perhaps, Maybe, Possibly
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Both **あるいは** and **もしかしたら** can express possibility, but **もしかしたら** stands alone as an adverb
      and often implies a lower degree of certainty or is used when speculating. **あるいは** directly connects
      two alternatives or possibilities.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **あるいは** directly links alternatives, while
  **か** can function as a question marker as well. **もしかしたら** focuses more on the speaker's uncertainty
  or speculation, whereas **あるいは** presents distinct options.
