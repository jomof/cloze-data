  The adverbial particle まで is used to express the idea of "even" or "to the extent of". It highlights the surprising or significant nature of the statement that follows. Think of it as emphasizing that something unexpected or extreme is true. It can follow nouns or verbs (in their dictionary form). While まで can also mean "until", in this context, it emphasizes a limit or extreme point. The part before まで sets the boundary or extent, and the part after reveals something noteworthy reaching or exceeding that boundary.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  When used with verbs, the verb is usually in its dictionary form.
  *  The nuance often implies surprise or emphasis on the extent of something.
  *  It can sometimes be used with も (までも) for added emphasis, meaning something like "even more so" or "especially".

  - term: さえ
    meaning: Even
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both まで and さえ can mean "even", さえ often implies a condition or a minimum requirement.
      まで tends to emphasize the extent or degree to a greater extent than さえ.
  - term: Noun + まで
    meaning: Until, Till, To (but no further than)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: When used with a noun of time or place, まで indicates a limit up to which something continues.
      The nuance here is about duration or destination, unlike the "even" meaning.
  - term: Verb + まで
    meaning: Until (something) happens
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to the noun usage, verb + まで indicates the time leading up to an event. The focus
      is on the temporal boundary, not the surprising extent.
  - term: ほど
    meaning: The more, About, To the extent that, So much… that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ほど often expresses a degree or comparison. While it can indicate extent, it frequently involves
      a comparison or a sense of "about," which is different from まで's emphasis on "even".
  - term: くらい ②
    meaning: To the extent that, So…that, About the only thing that...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: くらい can express degree, but often implies a subjective feeling or approximation. まで focuses
      more directly on the surprising nature of the extent.
  - term: ほど～ない
    meaning: Is not as…as, Isn't... like..., Not to the extent of...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: This is a comparative structure meaning something is not as much as something else. While
      it relates to degree, it's used for negative comparisons, whereas まで expresses a positive extent.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that まで as "even" highlights something unexpected
  or extreme. When まで is used with nouns or verbs indicating time, it signifies "until". Expressions like
  ほど and くらい also relate to degree, but often involve comparison or approximation, unlike まで's focus on
  the surprising extent.
