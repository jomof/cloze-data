  という理由で is a phrase that is used when giving reasons for (A). (A) may be a range of different things, from what happened, to what one's opinion is. Due to という quoting the previous statement as being the "reason", という理由で puts quite a bit of emphasis on the reason itself. Because of this, the expression is quite similar to "being that" in English.
  The case marking particle で will be used after 理由 to show that "with" or "by means of" that reason, (B).

  **Fun Fact**
  Almost all cases where という理由で will be used may be replaced by というわけで. However, the reverse is not true. The reason that わけ may be used for 理由, but 理由 cannot always be used for わけ (especially at the beginning of sentences) is because わけ is another way of reading the kanji for 理由. However, the more common kanji for 訳 will never be read as りゆう.

  - term: そのため(に)
    meaning: For that reason, Because of that, To that end
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar in meaning, 「そのため(に)」 often focuses more on the consequence or purpose that
      arises from the reason, whereas 「という理由で」 emphasizes the reason itself.
post_false_friends_writeup: Both 「という理由で」 and 「そのため(に)」 indicate a cause-and-effect relationship. However,
  「という理由で」 directly quotes or refers to the stated reason, adding emphasis to it. 「そのため(に)」 often leads
  into the result or action taken because of that reason, focusing more on the consequence. Think of 「という理由で」
  as highlighting 'the reason being...' and 「そのため(に)」 as highlighting 'therefore...'
