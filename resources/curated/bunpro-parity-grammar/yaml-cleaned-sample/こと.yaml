  Similar to のは, **こと** is used in Japanese for nominalization, turning a verb into a noun-like phrase. However, unlike のは which combines two particles, **こと** is a noun itself. To use **こと**, simply attach it to the end of a verb in its dictionary form. **こと** (or 事 in kanji) is a noun often translated as "thing." In the context of nominalization, it literally means "the thing that is (A)". As illustrated in the examples, ない can be inserted between the verb and **こと** to express negation. While other auxiliary verbs can be used with **こと** in this way, ない is the most frequent. Although this explanation focuses on **こと** following the dictionary form of verbs, it can follow any plain form verb. "Plain form" refers to any verb form not ending in the polite ます.

  **Important Consideration:** When a short sentence concludes with **こと**, it often conveys the nuance of a rule or command. In this usage, **こと** is not a noun but a sentence-ending particle. Sentence-ending particle **こと** is almost never written in kanji. However, it originates from the same word.
