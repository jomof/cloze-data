  **もしも** is an adverb in Japanese that intensifies the meaning of **もし** slightly. While **もし** means "if", **もしも** carries a stronger sense of "supposing that" or "what if". It's essentially **もし** combined with the adverbial particle **も**, which adds a nuance of "even". So, literally, **もしも** could be understood as "even if a bit".

  **Usage**:

  - **もしも** is used at the beginning of a sentence to introduce a hypothetical situation.
  - It is almost always followed by an expression indicating a hypothesis, such as **ば**, **と**, **なら**, or **ても**. Therefore, you'll often see **もしも～なら** (if... then) or **もしも～でも** (even if... then).
  - **Important Consideration**: **もし** and **もしも** generally introduce a condition where the second part of the sentence describes a likely consequence or result of that condition.

  **Contrast with たとえ**:

  - While both **もしも** and **たとえ** can be translated as "if" or "even if", there's a subtle difference. **たとえ** focuses on a contrastive situation and emphasizes that the result remains the same regardless of the condition. In contrast, **もしも** focuses on the potential outcome of a hypothetical situation.

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how **もしも** sets up a hypothetical scenario. Notice how
  the sentences often use **なら** or **ても** to further elaborate on the hypothetical condition. The contrast
  with **たとえ** highlights that **もしも** typically implies a direct consequence, whereas **たとえ** emphasizes
  that the outcome remains despite the condition.
false_friends:
  - term: たとえ〜ても
    meaning: Even if…is the case, Supposing that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **もしも～なら/でも**, **たとえ～ても** emphasizes that the outcome remains the same regardless of
      the condition.
  - term: なら
    meaning: Were it, If, If it's the case, As for (Conditional)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: '**なら** is a conditional form that means "if that''s the case". While it can express a hypothetical,
      it doesn''t carry the same level of emphasis on the supposition as **もしも～なら**.'
  - term: もし
    meaning: If (For emphasis)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: '**もし** also means "if", but **もしも** adds a stronger sense of supposition or "what if".'
  - term: でも
    meaning: Or something, Any... (with question words), No matter (who)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While **でも** is part of the **もしも～でも** construction, on its own it has different meanings
      and isn't directly interchangeable with **もしも～なら/でも**.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **もしも** sets up a hypothetical scenario
  where the following clause is a likely consequence. **たとえ** focuses on a situation where the result
  doesn't change despite the circumstances. **もし** is a simpler "if", and **なら** is a conditional that
  often follows from a previous statement. Pay attention to the nuance of consequence versus unchanged
  outcome when choosing between these options.
