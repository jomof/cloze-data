writeup: |-
  When combined with the adverbial particle は, 以上 is frequently translated as "since (A), (B)", "now that (A), (B)", or "as long as (A), (B)". This is a **formal** structure that is rarely found in daily speech. This construction may be used with verbs and い-Adjectives in their dictionary forms, and な-Adjectives or nouns followed by である以上は. As with many other grammar points, the particle は is often dropped, leaving 以上 by itself.

  Due to である以上は often presenting something which is being acted upon, the (B) part of sentences that include this grammar structure will frequently include the resolutions or intentions of the speaker, and can be thought of as either **obvious** or **necessary** once considering (A). This usually appears in the form of べきだ, つもりだ, はずだ, たい, ほうがいい, and similar patterns.

  **Fun fact**: Despite the standard translations, the literal meaning of "above and beyond (A), (B)" is also a good way to remember this grammar pattern, as it basically highlights that anything "past", "beyond", or "above" (A) is what needs to be considered.

false_friends:
  - term: 以来
    meaning: Since, Henceforth
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 以上, 以来 emphasizes the time elapsed since a certain event and focuses on the continuation
      of a state or action from that point forward. 以上 focuses more on a current state or decision leading
      to a consequence or obligation.
  - term: 上は
    meaning: Once, Since, Now that, As long as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 上は is quite similar to 以上 and often interchangeable. However, 上は can sometimes carry a stronger
      sense of finality or resolution once a certain condition is met, whereas 以上 focuses more on the
      logical consequence of a given situation.
  - term: からには
    meaning: As long as, Since, Given
    kind: synonym
    nuance: からには is similar to 以上 but often implies a stronger sense of commitment, determination, or
      natural consequence stemming from a previous action or decision. 以上 is a bit more general and can
      be used for stating logical conclusions.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 以上 with these similar expressions, remember that 以上 often
  highlights the logical consequence or obligation arising from a certain state or decision. While 以来
  focuses on the time passed since an event, 上は emphasizes finality, and からには emphasizes a strong sense
  of commitment or natural consequence. Pay attention to the nuance of each expression to choose the most
  appropriate one for the context.
