writeup: |-
  をよそに is used to express that (A) is something that effectively has nothing to do with the speaker, or that the speaker is ignoring it in relation to something else. It may be translated as "ignoring (A)", or "disregarding (A)". It is a combination of the adverbial particle を, the noun 余所 'other place', and the case-marking particle に. Due to this, its literal meaning is close to "putting (A) completely aside, (B)". This structure will follow nouns, or phrases that have been nominalized with の. It is reasonably formal, so will be seen more often in writing.

  The most common pattern for をよそに to follow is that (A) expresses some overall situation, while (B) indicates an action that is being done without any thought or care given toward those circumstances. Because of this, it is often used critically about actions that are seen as irresponsible.

  **Important Consideration**:
  While this grammar point will primarily highlight the actions of people, it will not be used to refer to the speaker's own actions.
examples:
  - japanese: 彼は親の心配をよそに、毎晩夜遅くまで友達たちと遊んでいる。
    english: Ignoring his parents' worries, he hangs out with his friends every night until late.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: Using 「～ている」 gives the sense of an ongoing, habitual action, highlighting the continuous disregard
      for parental concerns. The casual 「友達たち」 also fits the informal nature of the sentence.
  - japanese: 社長は社員の反対をよそに、仕事の効率を上げるために休憩所を撤去した。
    english: Ignoring objections from his employees, the president removed the break room to increase
      work efficiency.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of 「社長」 (company president) and the formal context of workplace efficiency align with

      feelings and the listener's actions.

      their future) suggests an intimate and focused conversation, despite the surrounding environment.
      The formality of をよそに lends a slightly serious tone to the discussion.
