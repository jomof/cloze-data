  「っけ」 is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese used when the speaker is trying to recall or confirm information they've forgotten. It's similar to saying "again?" in English. Grammatically, 「っけ」 should follow the past form of the auxiliary verbs 「だ」 or 「た」, resulting in 「だったっけ」 or 「たっけ」. It's also common to see the use of 「のだ」 or 「んだ」 to introduce the situation or reason, leading to forms like 「～なんだっけ」.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  While traditional grammar dictates the use of 「だったっけ」 or 「たっけ」, younger generations often omit 「だ」 and directly attach 「っけ」 to verbs in their dictionary form. Be aware of this informal usage, though it's not appropriate for formal settings or writing.
  *  「っけ」 can be used when asking a rhetorical question to oneself or when directly asking someone else for confirmation.

  - term: か (question)
    meaning: Question marking particle
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「っけ」, 「か」 is a general question particle and doesn't imply the speaker is trying to
      recall forgotten information. 「か」 can be used in both formal and informal settings, whereas 「っけ」
      is strictly casual.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「っけ」 and 「か」 can form questions, 「っけ」 carries the specific nuance
  of checking one's memory or confirming something previously known. 「か」 is a more straightforward question
  marker without this implication. Be mindful of the context and whether you are simply asking a question
  or trying to remember something when choosing between them.
