writeup: でしょう is a polite auxiliary verb often used to express **conjecture**, **probability**, or to
  seek **confirmation** from the listener. It's a conjugated form of です and can also appear in the more
  casual contraction でしょ. While it translates to things like "right?" or "probably," it fundamentally
  conveys an assertion with the assumption that the listener will likely agree. The speaker usually has
  some basis for their assertion. Because でしょう is derived from です (the polite form of だ), it typically
  follows the plain form of verbs and adjectives. However, in highly formal contexts or older literature,
  you might encounter ～ますでしょう. It's important to note that while it might sound like the speaker is lacking
  confidence, using でしょう actually indicates they have some reason to believe their statement is true.

post_false_friends_writeup: While でしょう, だろう, じゃないか, ね, and のではないだろうか can all translate to similar English
  phrases, they carry different nuances in Japanese. でしょう is a polite way to express probability or seek
  agreement. だろう is its more casual counterpart, often used by men. じゃないか is more direct and assertive.
  ね is a softer, informal way to seek agreement. のではないだろうか expresses a more considered and less certain
  opinion. On the other hand, かもしれない explicitly expresses uncertainty and possibility, making it distinct
  from the other expressions which imply a degree of certainty or expectation of agreement.
