writeup: |-
  「～やがる」 is a colloquial expression, derived from the verb 「上がる (あがる)」, used to express strong negative feelings such as scorn, anger, or disdain towards someone else's actions. It carries a nuance of **indignation that someone dared to do something**. It's almost exclusively used by men. You can think of it as saying someone "had the nerve to" or "freaking" did something that irritates you.

  It attaches to the **conjunctive form (masu-stem)** of a verb. While the example sentences mainly show 「～やがった」 (past tense), it can be used in other tenses as well, depending on the context. Attaching 「やがる」 to the て-form of a verb (e.g., 「～てやがる」) has the same meaning and is an abbreviation of 「～ている」 + 「あがる」.
