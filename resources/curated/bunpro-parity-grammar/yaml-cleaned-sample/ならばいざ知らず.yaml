writeup: |-
  **ならいざ知らず** combines the hypothetical form of the auxiliary verb だ (**なら**), the adverb **いざ** meaning “now” or “well then”, and the negated form of the verb **知る** (知らず, "not knowing"). It expresses the idea of setting aside one possibility or extreme case to highlight a contrast with another. It's often translated as “I don't know about (A), but (B)” or “maybe (A), but (B).” This expression is formal and emphasizes that regardless of (A), (B) is a definite case or fits a specific description.

  **Usage:**

  *  **Following verbs:** Attach **ならいざ知らず** directly to the verb in its plain form.
  *  **Following nouns/na-adjectives:** Replace the final **だ** with **なら**.
  *  **Following i-adjectives (nominalized):** Attach **ならいざ知らず** to the nominalized form using **の**. This pattern is less common than the direct attachment to verbs.

  The literal sense is akin to “if it's (A), well then I don't know,” highlighting the uncertainty or setting aside of (A) to emphasize the certainty of (B). While there's no explicit “but” in the Japanese, the contrast between the unknown (A) and known (B) implies it.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Often, (A) serves as an extreme or unlikely scenario to emphasize the difference with the more realistic or relevant (B).
  *  While **は** can sometimes replace **なら**, the overall meaning remains the same.

  **Fun Fact:** This grammar point often carries a nuance of surprise or mild irritation, especially when (A) is something obviously unreasonable compared to (B).
