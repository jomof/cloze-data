writeup: |-
  めく is a somewhat unusual う-verb because it's primarily used as a suffix. It carries the meaning of "to show signs of (A)" or "to have the appearance of (A)". It attaches directly to nouns, indicating the speaker's perception or feeling that something is similar to that noun. Since めく is a verb, it can conjugate into various forms depending on its role in the sentence. When directly modifying another noun, the past tense form めいた is very common.

  The crucial point is that めく highlights the speaker's subjective feeling or impression. Often, the thing being described isn't actually the noun it's attached to, and the speaker is often aware of this distinction.

  **Important Considerations:** めく is often used with set noun phrases. It's best to stick to common expressions you've encountered. Examples include 謎めく ("to appear to be a riddle"), 皮肉めく ("to appear to be sarcastic"), 言い訳めく ("to appear to be an excuse"), 作り物めく ("to appear to be fictitious"), and names of seasons.
