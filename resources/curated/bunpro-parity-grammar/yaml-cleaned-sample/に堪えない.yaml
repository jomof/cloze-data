writeup: |-
  に堪えない is a construction that translates as “to not be able to bear (A),” or “to not be able to tolerate (A).” It combines the case-marking particle に and the negative form of the る-verb 堪える (“to tolerate”), 堪えない. In this meaning, に堪えない is used following verbs.

  This contrasts with the に堪えない grammar point that follows nouns and means “to be very (A),” but more literally, “to be so (A) I can't stand it.”

  Although 堪える is more frequently used than other kanji with the same reading and similar meanings, this isn't always the case. Sometimes 耐える (“to withstand”) is used when the emphasis is on the ability to endure (A), while 絶える (“to discontinue” or “to peter out”) is used when the focus is on not being able to suppress (A). For 絶える, this is particularly common with strong feelings.

  **Caution**: The affirmative form of に堪える can also express that something is “worth doing.” A closer interpretation would be similar to the English phrase “to be passable for (A).” Rather than meaning something is particularly suitable, it highlights that it acceptably falls into the category of (A), even if not intended for it or perhaps not expected.
