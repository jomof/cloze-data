writeup: まるで～ようだ (marude ~ yō da) expresses a strong resemblance or comparison, translating to "it is
  entirely as if" or "it is just as though." The adverb まるで (marude), meaning "entirely" or "completely,"
  intensifies the comparison made by ようだ (yō da), which signifies "it seems like" or "it is like." This
  structure suggests a situation that strongly resembles another, often to a surprising or exaggerated
  degree. You'll often see まるで at the beginning of the sentence, setting up the comparison. While ようだ
  is most common, you might also encounter similar expressions like みたいだ.
