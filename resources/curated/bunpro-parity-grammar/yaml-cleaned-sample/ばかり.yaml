writeup: |-
  The particle ばかり emphasizes that **only** or **nothing but** the preceding noun or verb is being done or exists. When used with verbs, it typically follows the て-form (てばかり). While it's common to see てばかりいる, the いる is optional and doesn't fundamentally change the meaning. When ばかり comes before a sentence connector, it's often followed by で (for nouns and verbs) or いて (for verbs only). It's important to note that the で in this case is the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb だ, not the particle で.

  **Fun Fact:** While rarely written in kanji, ばかり originates from 許り (sometimes 計る). This kanji carries the meaning of "to let off" or "to let through," implying that only the specified action or thing is being "permitted" in a given situation.

  mean 'only', but ばかり often adds a nuance of repetition or being engrossed in that one thing. Conversely,
  phrases like ばかりでなく and だけでなく(て)～も have the opposite meaning, indicating 'not only... but also' and
  adding information rather than restricting it.
