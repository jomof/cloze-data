writeup: The grammar point **ところだった** combined with the dictionary form of a verb indicates that something
  was on the verge of happening, or in the process of happening, but ultimately didn't reach completion
  due to some intervening event or realization. It often conveys a sense of near-miss or narrowly avoided
  outcome. It can be translated as "was just about to do (A)" or "was in the middle of (A)". Often, **ところだった**
  implies a close call, where the action almost occurred. When a positive outcome was nearly achieved
  but missed, **のに** is frequently used after **ところだった**, conveying a sense of regret or disappointment,
  like "despite almost doing (A), (B) happened instead."

      how close the speaker was to hitting the person.

    english: If I had woken up three minutes later, I would have been late.

      means 'being captivated' and adds to the romantic nuance. 「～ところだったよ」 with the 「よ」 softens the statement
      slightly while still conveying the intent.
    etymology: 「見惚れる」 combines the kanji for 'see' and 'be charmed'.

  of relief (if a negative outcome was avoided) or disappointment (if a positive outcome was missed).
false_friends:
  - term: ところだった ①
    meaning: Almost, Nearly, About to, On the verge of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both express being close to doing something, **ところだった ①** often focuses more on the
      potential outcome or consequence that was narrowly avoided, while **ところだった ②** can also emphasize
      being in the middle of an action when something else occurred.
post_false_friends_writeup: Both versions of ところだった indicate a near occurrence. However, when distinguishing
  them, consider if the emphasis is on the potential consequence that was avoided (①), or on the state
  of being in the process of doing something when an interruption happened (②).
