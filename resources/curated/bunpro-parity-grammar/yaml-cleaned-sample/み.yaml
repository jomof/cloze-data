  **み** is a common suffix in Japanese that transforms adjectives into nouns, often translated as "(A)ness" in English. To use **み**, attach it to the stem form of either い-Adjectives or な-Adjectives. The 語幹 (stem form) is the form with い removed for い-Adjectives (e.g., 暖(あたた)かい becomes 暖(あたた)か), or な removed for な-Adjectives (e.g., 静(しず)かな becomes 静(しず)か).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **み** highlights the **condition** or **place** in which something exists in a constant state. It's used for innate qualities and not for varying degrees of something. For instance, you wouldn't use it to describe *how much* warmth there is, but rather the inherent quality of warmth itself.
  *  **み** can also directly substitute **味(あじ)**, meaning "taste." In these cases, **み** describes a quality that can be sensed, such as taste or color.

  **Difference from ~ness:** While often translated as "~ness", **み** focuses on the inherent quality rather than a measurable degree.
