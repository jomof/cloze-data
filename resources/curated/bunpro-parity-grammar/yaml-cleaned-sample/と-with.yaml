writeup: In this lesson about と, we will focus on its use to express "with". The particle と indicates
  a connection or relationship between two or more nouns (A and B). When translated as "with", it signifies
  that the nouns marked by と are equally participating in the action. This contrasts with the particle
  に, which often highlights a direction or target of an action, making the relationship feel more one-sided.
  For example, 「トムと話す」 implies a mutual conversation, whereas 「トムに話す」 suggests speaking *to* Tom, potentially
  without his active participation in the speaking.
examples:
  - japanese: トムと話す。
    english: I talk with Tom.

    nuance: Simple sentence indicating a mutual action of speaking.
  - japanese: 僕は友達とごはんを食べる。

  - japanese: ねえ、今度の日曜日、僕と一緒に映画でも見に行かない?
    english: Hey, won't you go see a movie with me or something next Sunday?
    register: casual
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「ねえ」 is a casual way to get someone's attention, and 「一緒」 means together, suggesting going
      with the speaker. 「～でも見に行かない?」 is a casual invitation.
  - japanese: あのさ、今度よかったら一緒にご飯でもどうかな?
    english: Hey, if you're free sometime, how about we get dinner or something?
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「あのさ」 is a casual conversation starter. 「よかったら」 means 'if you're free'. Inviting someone for
      「一緒にご飯」 (dinner together) is a common way to flirt or suggest a date.
  - japanese: すみません、ちょっとよろしいですか?今、部長と打ち合わせ中でして。
    english: Excuse me, do you have a moment? I'm currently in a meeting with the department head.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「すみません」 is a polite way to apologize or get someone's attention. 「部長と」 shows he's meeting
      with the department head, and 「～ていまして」 is a polite way to describe a current state.
post_example_writeup: Remember that while と often translates to "and" when connecting nouns performing
  separate actions, when it translates to "with", it highlights the shared involvement of the connected
  nouns in a single action.
