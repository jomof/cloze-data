grammar_point: ならともかく
jlpt: N2
meaning: If it's (A), sure, but (B), Putting aside (A), (B)
writeup: The grammar point **ならともかく** is used to express a contrast between two situations. It suggests
  that while something might be acceptable or understandable in one scenario (A), it is not in another
  (B). Think of it as saying, "If it were *this*, then maybe, but since it's *that*, then no." The **なら**
  indicates a hypothetical situation, and **ともかく** means "anyway" or "at any rate," but in this context,
  it functions to set aside the first condition. The focus is usually on the second part of the sentence
  following **ならともかく**.
