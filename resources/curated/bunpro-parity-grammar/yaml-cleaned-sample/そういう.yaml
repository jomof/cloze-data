writeup: 「そういう」 is a pre-noun adjectival expression derived from the adverb 「そう」 (like that) and the verb
  「言う」 (to say). It literally means "saying in that way" or "of that sort." It's used to describe the
  **kind** or **type** of something, referring to a previously mentioned or understood situation, manner,
  or characteristic. It belongs to the こそあど言葉 group, specifically the 「そ」 series, which refers to something
  near the listener or previously mentioned. As a pre-noun adjectival, it directly modifies a noun. Be
  careful not to confuse the adverb 「そう」 with the auxiliary verb 「そうだ」 (it seems, I heard that).

  - term: そんな・こんな・あんな・どんな
    meaning: Such a・Kind of, Something like ~
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「そんな」、「こんな」、「あんな」、and 「どんな」 are similar to 「そういう」, they don't include the 「言う」 element,
      which subtly implies a categorization based on how something is said or described. 「そんな」 often carries
      a stronger emotional connotation or a sense of disbelief, while 「こんな」 emphasizes something close
      to the speaker, and 「あんな」 refers to something distant to both speaker and listener. 「どんな」 is a more
      direct way of asking "what kind of?" without the implication of a previous description.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「そういう」 often refers back to a previously
  mentioned or understood characteristic or manner, linking it to the act of "saying" or describing. 「そんな」
  can express surprise or emotion, 「こんな」 emphasizes proximity to the speaker, and 「あんな」 emphasizes distance.
  「どんな」 is a more straightforward question about the type or kind of something.
