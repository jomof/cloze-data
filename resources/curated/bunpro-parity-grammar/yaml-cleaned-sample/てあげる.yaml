writeup: |-
  When the conjunction particle **て** joins with the verb **あげる** (to give), it implies that someone is doing something for the benefit of someone else. Literally, this expression means "to give/bestow the action of (A) upon (B)", but it translates more naturally as "to do (A) for (B)" or "to do (A) as a favor for (B)". The receiver of the **てあげる** action is marked with **に**, while the doer is marked with **が** (if mentioned).

  **Caution:** Unfortunately, **てあげる** can sound quite patronizing in modern Japanese and should be avoided in situations where someone might take offense at having something done for them (for example, doing something for someone of higher status). This is primarily due to **やる** (a casual variation of "to give") being phased out in many contexts.

  **Etymology:** Originally, **やる** was used when referring to giving water to plants or feeding animals. However, some people started using **あげる** for these purposes as well, believing that it sounded "nicer". Historically, this actually achieved the opposite result, and some people began to think that **あげる** was insulting, as it was being used for plants/animals. These days, **てやる** is almost never used unless you have a very close relationship with someone and are using it jokingly.

post_example_writeup: While 「てあげる」 is a valid grammatical structure, it's important to be mindful of the
  nuances and potential for it to sound condescending. In many situations, simply stating what you did
  or offering help without the 「あげる」 might be more appropriate, especially with people of higher social
  standing or the elderly. Consider the social context and your relationship with the person you're speaking
  to.

  you are *receiving* an action. And 「あげる」 by itself is about giving an object.
