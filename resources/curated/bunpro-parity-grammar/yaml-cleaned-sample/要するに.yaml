writeup: 要するに is an expression in Japanese used to highlight **important** information, similar to "to
  sum up", "in summary", or "in short" in English. It's a combination of the する-verb 要(よう)する meaning "to
  need" or "to require", and に. Literally, it means something akin to "as for what's necessary." This
  phrase **always** appears at the beginning of a sentence, introducing a condensed version of what has
  been previously said.
