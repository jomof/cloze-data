  「たびに」 is used to express that something happens **every time** a certain event or action occurs. It's similar to saying "each time" or "whenever." It is the adverbial form of the noun 「度」(ど), meaning "time" (as in "at the time of").

  「たびに」 is attached directly to the **dictionary form of verbs** or follows the particle 「の」 after **nouns**.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Like 「ごとに」, 「たびに」 means "every." However, 「たびに」 often carries the nuance of 「するごとに」 ("every time doing").
  *  Because of this nuance, 「たびに」 is typically used to emphasize an action or event that repeats, rather than simply indicating intervals of time.
