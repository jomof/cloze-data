writeup: だんだん is an adverb that expresses a **slow and steady progression** of something. It implies a
  change happening **incrementally over time**. The word originates from the kanji 段々 (dandan), which
  literally means "step by step." Think of it like climbing stairs - each step is a small advancement.
  だんだん can modify entire phrases, indicating that the whole situation is changing gradually. You can optionally
  use the particle と with だんだん, but it's frequently omitted, which is common with many Japanese adverbs
  and onomatopoeic expressions.

false_friends:
  - term: どんどん
    meaning: Rapidly, More and more, Steadily
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike だんだん, どんどん emphasizes a faster pace of change or progression. It can also imply a larger
      degree of change.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing だんだん and どんどん, think of だんだん as a gentle incline and どんどん
  as a steeper one. Both indicate progression, but the speed and intensity of that progression differ
  significantly.
