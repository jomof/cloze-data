writeup: |-
  The construction **〜に〜ない** is used with a repeating verb to express that one cannot do something even if they want to, often due to external circumstances or psychological barriers. The particle **に** follows the verb in its dictionary form, and the potential form of the same verb is negated with **ない**. The literal sense is something like "for doing (A), doing (A) is not possible."

  When the verb is **する**, which doesn't have a true potential form, **できない** is used in the second half of the expression.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  Sometimes, instead of the dictionary form, you might see the volitional form (う/よう) followed by **にも**. The meaning remains the same, but the dictionary form tends to emphasize psychological reasons for inability, while the volitional form emphasizes more concrete or physical reasons.
  *  Other negative forms besides **ない**, such as **ず**, can also be used.
examples:
  - japanese: 生徒が言った冗談は面白かったが内容が下品だったので笑うに笑えなかった。
    english: The joke the student told was funny, but it was inappropriate so I couldn't laugh even if
      I wanted to.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: semi-formal
    setting: storytelling
    speaker_age: older
    listener_age: younger
    nuance: The sentence uses the past tense 「笑えなかった」 indicating a recollection of an event. The situation
      「内容が下品だった」 made it difficult to laugh even though the joke was 「面白かった」.
    etymology: 笑う (warau) means 'to laugh', and 笑える (waraeru) is the potential form meaning 'can laugh'.
  - japanese: 本当は時間はあんまりなかったが、先輩に頼まれたから断るに断れなかった。
    english: I actually didn't really have much time, but since my senpai asked me, I couldn't refuse
      even if I wanted to.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_age: younger
    listener_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「あんまり」 adds a nuance of 'not really' or 'not much'. The speaker feels obligated
      to fulfill the request from their 「先輩」, hence 「断れなかった」.
  - japanese: 息子には明日までに滑り台を作ってあげると約束してしまったので、どんなに忙しくても引くに引けない。
    english: I promised my son that I would build him a slide by tomorrow, so I can't back out no matter

    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「〜てあげる」 indicates that the speaker is doing something for someone else (his son).
      「引くに引けない」 conveys a sense of being committed to the promise.
    etymology: 引く (hiku) means 'to pull' or 'to draw back', and 引ける (hikeru) is the potential form meaning
      'can pull back' or in this context, 'can back out'.
  - japanese: 最近は色々と悩み事が多くて、集中するに集中できない。
    english: A lot has been on my mind recently that I haven't been able to concentrate even if I wanted
      to.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「悩み事が多い」 indicates the speaker is burdened with worries, making it difficult to 「集中する」.
    etymology: 集中する (shūchū suru) means 'to concentrate', and 集中できる (shūchū dekiru) is the potential form
      meaning 'can concentrate'.
  - japanese: 息子が一晩中泣いていて寝るに寝れず徹夜をしてしまった。
    english: My son cried all night, and because of that, I couldn't sleep even if I wanted to and stayed
      up all night.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The sentence uses the te-form of the negated potential verb 「寝れず」 which connects the cause
      (son crying) to the result (staying up all night).
    etymology: 寝る (neru) means 'to sleep', and 寝れる (nereru) is the potential form meaning 'can sleep'.
  - japanese: 昨日の練習で足の怪我をしてしまったので歩こうにも歩けない。
    english: I couldn't walk even if I wanted to because I injured my foot in yesterday's practice.
    conjugation: volitional (plain)
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: Here, the volitional form 「歩こう」 is used with 「にも」, emphasizing the physical inability due
      to the injury.
    etymology: 歩く (aruku) means 'to walk', and 歩ける (arukeru) is the potential form meaning 'can walk'.
  - japanese: 今の仕事を辞めようと思っているが、次のところが見つからないから今の仕事を辞めようにも辞められない。
    english: I'm thinking of quitting my current job, but I can't find another one, so I couldn't quit
      my current job even if I wanted to.
    conjugation: volitional (plain)
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The repetition of 「辞めよう」 and 「辞められない」 highlights the speaker's desire to quit but the practical
      difficulty.
    etymology: 辞める (yameru) means 'to quit', and 辞められる (yamerareru) is the potential form meaning 'can
      quit'.
  - japanese: 中学生の頃、好きな子に告白して断られた。周りに人がいたから泣くに泣けない状況だった。
    english: During my junior high school days, I confessed to a girl I liked and was rejected. There
      were some people nearby, so I was in a position where I could not cry even if I wanted to.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「〜頃」 refers to a specific time in the past. The presence of 「周りの人」 created a social
      constraint, making it difficult to express sadness.
    etymology: 泣く (naku) means 'to cry', and 泣ける (nakeru) is the potential form meaning 'can cry'.

      they wanted to laugh but were unable to.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    nuance: The phrase 「〜という顔をしてた」 describes the expression on the employees' faces. The situation is
      funny, but the social context prevents them from laughing.
    etymology: 笑う (warau) means 'to laugh', and 笑える (waraeru) is the potential form meaning 'can laugh'.
  - japanese: 「彼はどうして学校に戻ろうとしないのかな?」「何があったか知らないけど、言うに言えない事情があるのかな。」
    english: '"Why is he not willing to go back to school?" "I''m not sure if something happened or not,
      but maybe he is in a situation where he cannot talk about it (even though he may want to)."'
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: casual
    setting: speculative
    nuance: This example shows the grammar point used in a dialogue. 「言うに言えない事情」 refers to circumstances
      too delicate or personal to discuss.
    etymology: 言う (iu) means 'to say', and 言える (ieru) is the potential form meaning 'can say'.
  - japanese: 「彼女が『断れば殺す』と言って突然断るに断れない状態になった。
    english: '"She said, ''If you refuse, I will kill you,'' so the situation suddenly turned into one
      where I couldn''t refuse even if I wanted to."'
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The direct quote 「断れば殺す」 illustrates a coercive situation where refusing is not an option.
    etymology: 断る (kotowaru) means 'to refuse', and 断れる (kotowareru) is the potential form meaning 'can
      refuse'.
  - japanese: 今日、会議があるけど、雪が積もって道が通行止めになったから行くに行けない。

      if I want to.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: casual

      the meeting.
