  The particle **か** is used to embed questions within a larger sentence. Think of it like saying "whether" or "if" in English when you're reporting a question. This is the same **か** that indicates a question at the end of a sentence, but here it functions adverbially, marking an uncertain point within the statement.

  **Key Points:**

  *  The phrase before **か** is essentially a question turned into a clause.
  *  The main part of the sentence then provides information about that question, often involving verbs of knowing, asking, or deciding.
  *  Be careful not to use **だ** or **です** directly before **か** when it's embedding a question. This is why you say どこか (somewhere) and not どこだか.
