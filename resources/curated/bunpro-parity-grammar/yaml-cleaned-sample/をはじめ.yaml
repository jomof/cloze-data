  When presenting a topic in Japanese as a "starting point", を始め will often be used to show any logic (or planned) progressions from that point. This is often translated as "not only (A), but (B)", or "starting with (A), (B)". To use を始め, one noun will be highlighted as the starting point, before another (or several others) will appear in part (B) of the sentence.

  Due to sentences featuring はじめ placing emphasis on (A) as a starting point, additional expressions such as として (or とする) will sometimes be paired with it. These structures function to further emphasize (A), and are similar to "with (A) as the starting point, (B)".

      of 「をはじめ」.

post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 「だけでなく」, 「はもちろん」, and 「ばかりでなく」 share the meaning of
  "not only... but also", they don't carry the specific nuance of "starting with" that 「をはじめ」 does. 「に加えて」
  emphasizes addition, and 「に限らず」 means "not limited to". 「を皮切りに」 is a closer synonym to 「をはじめ」, but often
  implies a clear sequence or progression following the starting point.
