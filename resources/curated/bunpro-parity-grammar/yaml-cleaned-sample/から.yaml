  The particle **から** is primarily used to indicate the **starting point** of an action or movement. It translates directly to "from" in English. Think of it as marking the origin or source of something. It follows the noun indicating that origin. It's a very fundamental particle and you'll see it everywhere!

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Placement:** **から** always comes *after* the noun it modifies, indicating the source.
  *  **No だ needed:** Unlike the "because" usage of から, when indicating "from", you don't use だ after nouns or な-adjectives.

  - term: てから
    meaning: Once...is done, Once...happens, After doing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **から**, **てから** indicates a sequence of actions. The action before **てから** must be
      completed before the next action can occur.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both **から** and **てから** can relate to time, their core functions differ.
  **から** in this context marks a starting point, whereas **てから** specifies a sequential order of actions.
  Think of **から** as defining 'where it begins' and **てから** as defining 'what happens after'.
