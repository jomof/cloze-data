  「どれ」 is from the same family of words as 「これ」, 「それ」, and 「あれ」. These words are called こそあど言葉 in Japanese. Unlike the other three, which all point to a specific thing, words starting with 「ど」 are designed for enquiring about something unknown. 「どれ」 can roughly be translated as "which" in English and is used for enquiring about a group (of three or more things).

  From these examples, we can see that the particle 「が」 is often used with 「どれ」, especially when preceding questions. However, when 「どれ」 follows a noun, 「は」 will be used.

  When there are only two choices to select between, 「どちら」+ 「の」, or 「どっち」+ 「の」 will be used instead of 「どれ」. This is a habit that has become part of the language over time and was not originally how these words were used.

post_false_friends_writeup: Remember that 「どれ」 stands alone as a pronoun, while 「どの」 acts like an adjective
  and must be followed by a noun. The こそあど words 「これ」、「それ」、「あれ」 point to specific items, whereas 「どれ」
  asks to identify one from a group.
