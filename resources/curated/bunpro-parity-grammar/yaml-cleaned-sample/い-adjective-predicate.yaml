writeup: |-
  A **predicate** is a word that describes the topic/subject of a sentence. The Japanese equivalent of this is a 述語 (**jutsugo**), which literally means "statement word." As a predicate, い-adjectives (**i-keiyoushi**) can appear by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used at the end of a sentence.

  When there are no other words apart from the adjective itself, it comes across similar to "It's cute" or "It's hot" in English. We just have to guess what the "it" is from context.

  In many sentences, either は (**wa**) or が (**ga**) could be used to mark the word/words that the predicate is describing. However, which one sounds more natural will depend on many factors. In general, if you are specifically pointing out something as being different from other things in the same category, が will be used.

  **Important Consideration:**
  In this example, 「が」 (**ga**) is distinguishing this specific bath as having a unique level of hotness compared to others (maybe the water system is broken and only boiling water comes out). 「は」 (**wa**) would sound unnatural in this type of sentence, as it is not the 'normal' state of the bath.

  **Fun Fact:** All い-adjectives are words of Japanese origin.

    nuance: 「綺麗だね」 is a direct and complimentary statement, with 「ね」 seeking a bit of acknowledgement
      or creating a softer tone.

    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「眩しかった」 is the past tense of the い-adjective 「眩しい」 (mabushii - dazzling), used to reminisce
      about a past event. The casual register and directness suit an early romantic context.
