  かもしれない is used to express **uncertainty or possibility**. While often treated as a single word, it's actually a combination of the particle かも, and the potential form of the う-verb 知る (to know) with the auxiliary verb ない attached. The literal translation is closer to "even (A), we cannot know." It's similar to saying "might" or "maybe" in English.

  To use かもしれない, attach it to the end of a verb, noun, な-adjective, or い-adjective in their **plain form** (non-polite).

  The polite form, かもしれません, is created by using the polite-potential form of 知る.

  Several colloquial variations exist, such as かも, かもしらん, and かもしれん. かも is the most common, while かもしらん can sound a bit rough or masculine.

false_friends:
  - term: おそらく
    meaning: Probably, Perhaps, (Most) likely, (I) fear that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike かもしれない, おそらく expresses a higher degree of probability. It suggests that something is
      more likely to happen.
  - term: でしょう
    meaning: Probably, Right?, Isn't it?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: でしょう is used for more confident predictions or when seeking agreement, whereas かもしれない expresses
      more uncertainty.
  - term: だろう
    meaning: Probably, Right?, Isn't it?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to でしょう, だろう implies a higher degree of certainty than かもしれない and is often used in
      more informal situations.
  - term: じゃないか
    meaning: Isn't it?, I bet...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: じゃないか is often used when the speaker feels quite sure about something, sometimes even with
      a sense of challenge or confirmation-seeking, which differs from the uncertainty of かもしれない.
  - term: もしかしたら
    meaning: Perhaps, Maybe, Possibly
    kind: synonym
    nuance: もしかしたら is very similar in meaning to かもしれない, both expressing possibility. However, もしかしたら
      often comes at the beginning of a sentence, whereas かもしれない comes at the end.
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like おそらく, でしょう, だろう, じゃないか, and もしかしたら all convey some
  level of uncertainty or possibility, it's important to understand the subtle differences. かもしれない indicates
  a relatively lower degree of certainty compared to おそらく, でしょう, and だろう. もしかしたら is very close in meaning
  but has a different placement in the sentence. Pay attention to the nuance of each expression to choose
  the most appropriate one for the context.
