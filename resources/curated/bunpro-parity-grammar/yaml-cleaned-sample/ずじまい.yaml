  `ずじまい` is a grammar structure that combines the literary form of the classical auxiliary verb `ぬ`, `ず` "not", and the voiced conjunctive form of the u-verb `しまう` "to finish", or "to bring to a close", `じまい`. Like `しまう`, `ずじまい` often indicates regret that something ended up a certain way. However, this regret is about '(A) **not happening**', due to the negation provided by `ず`. This structure is used following the **indeterminate form** (ない-form without the ない) of verbs. Common translations include "to end up not (A)" and "to not have done (A) in the end." `ずじまい` is very often followed by `だった` or `でした`, indicating that (A) was not something that turned out happening, despite the wishes or intentions of the doer.

  **Important Consideration:**
  As is always the case with `ず`, when used with the verb `する`, it becomes `せず`.
