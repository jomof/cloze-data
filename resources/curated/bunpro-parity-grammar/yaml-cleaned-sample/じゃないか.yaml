  When learning **じゃない** and **ではない**, it was mentioned that these constructions are often paired with the particle **か** to form a (usually casual) question. This lesson will delve deeper into this usage. Unlike **じゃない** and **ではない** (which follow a noun or な-Adjective), **じゃないか** can be attached to the end of almost any phrase to indicate a question. This is very similar to ending a sentence with "isn't it?" in English.

  When **じゃないか** feels too casual, **ではないか** can be used instead. While more formal, it can sometimes sound a bit stiff, making it best suited for situations where politeness is expected.

  politeness differs. Choose the appropriate form depending on the context and your relationship with
  the listener.

    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **じゃないか**, **じゃない** is simply the negative form and doesn't inherently carry the questioning
      nuance. It needs a question particle like **か** to become a question.
  - term: ね
    meaning: Isn't it?, Right? (Sentence ending particle)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While **ね** also seeks confirmation, it's generally softer and more agreeable than **じゃないか**,
      which can sometimes sound a bit assertive.
  - term: のではないだろうか
    meaning: I think ... isn't it?, It might be that..., Don't you agree?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **じゃないか**, **のではないだろうか** expresses more of a thoughtful consideration and invites agreement
      in a more formal way.
  - term: かもしれない

    nuance: Unlike **じゃないか**, **～のだろうか** expresses a genuine question or doubt to oneself, not necessarily
      seeking an answer from someone else.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **じゃないか** and **ではないか** are primarily used
  for seeking confirmation or expressing a rhetorical question. Expressions like **でしょう**, **だろう**, and
  **ね** also seek confirmation but with slightly different nuances in politeness and assertiveness. On
  the other hand, **かもしれない** and **～のだろうか** express uncertainty or internal questioning, differing from
  the confirmatory nature of **じゃないか**.
