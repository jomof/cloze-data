writeup: 及び is a conjunction that means "and" or "as well as." It is the conjunctive form of the verb
  及ぶ (およぶ), which means "to reach" or "to extend to." While often translated simply as "and," 及び carries
  a slightly more formal nuance, suggesting that the items it connects are being added or extended to
  each other. Being a conjunction, 及び typically appears at the beginning of a second clause or directly
  after a noun to introduce an addition. Due to its formality, 及び is primarily found in documents, articles,
  and official announcements.
