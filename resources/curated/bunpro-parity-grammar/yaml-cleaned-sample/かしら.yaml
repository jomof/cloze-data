writeup: かしら is a sentence-ending particle used to express uncertainty or doubt, similar to "I wonder"
  in English. It originates from the contraction of 「か知らぬ」 or 「かしらん」, both meaning "whether it is (A),
  I don't know." While the original forms were gender-neutral, **in modern Japanese, かしら is predominantly
  used by women**. It attaches to the end of a phrase, indicating the speaker's pondering or mild questioning
  about the preceding statement.
