  **精々 (せいぜい)** means "at most," "at best," "no more than," or "barely." It indicates an upper limit or the best possible outcome, often implying that the actual situation is likely less favorable. It's used to express the maximum extent something can reach or the highest expectation one can have. As an adverb, 精々 often appears at the beginning of a sentence or clause, before the element it modifies.

  Interestingly, 精々 is derived from the older term **精試 (せいし)**, which meant "to completely exhaust all of one's good faith." While the modern meaning doesn't relate to "good faith," it retains the sense of reaching a limit, whether it's a physical boundary, the extent of one's abilities, or the limit of what's considered possible.
