writeup: |-
  When used with time-related expressions, the structure **をもって** is often translated as "as of (A)" or "effective from (A)". This grammar pattern combines the adverbial particle **を** with **もって**, meaning "by means of". **をもって** is used after nouns indicating a specific time or event. As often seen in polite speech or official notifications, **をもって** can be read as **をもちまして**. Occasionally, the small っ (促音) might be dropped, resulting in **をもて**.

  **Important Consideration:** Although "effective from" can imply a starting point in English, **をもって** primarily emphasizes the end of something or what has occurred up to the specified end date. Therefore, it's not used to indicate the beginning of something without prior context.

  **Etymology:** Deriving from the kanji **以て**, and specifically meaning "by means of", **もって** originally gets its nuance from **持って** (motte), "to hold" or "to have". Thinking of **をもって** as working similarly to "having (A)" or "having reached (A)" can be helpful.

post_example_writeup: It's important to remember that while 「をもって」 indicates a point in time from which
  something is effective or concluded, it doesn't imply the start of something new without prior context.
  Avoid using it for situations where you simply want to state when something begins.
