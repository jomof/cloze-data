writeup: The word もう is a versatile adverb that primarily translates to **"already"** or **"anymore"**
  in English, depending on the context. The core meaning of もう suggests that something has unexpectedly
  reached its end. This single word elegantly handles the nuances that English separates into "already"
  (for completed positive actions) and "anymore" (for actions that have ceased, often in negative sentences).
examples:
  - japanese: あ～、もう無理。
    english: Ugh, that's it. (I've had enough, I'm done arguing/continuing).
    register: casual
    setting: frustrated
    nuance: The 「あ～」 at the beginning expresses a feeling of being overwhelmed or fed up. 「無理」 means 'impossible',
      and the 「もう」 reinforces the idea that the speaker has reached their limit.
  - japanese: もう学校に行きましたか。
    english: Have you gone to school already?
    register: polite
    setting: informative
    nuance: This is a straightforward question using 「か」 at the end to indicate an inquiry. 「もう」 here
      asks if the action of going to school is already completed.
  - japanese: もうその本を読んだよ。
    english: I've already read that book.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The 「よ」 at the end of the sentence is a masculine sentence-ending particle used to emphasize
      the statement or inform the listener of something. 「もう」 indicates the action of reading the book
      is completed.
  - japanese: もうコーヒー作ったんだ。
    english: I already made coffee.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The 「んだ」 at the end of the sentence is a common way to explain something in a casual setting.
      「もう」 here confirms the coffee making is already done.
  - japanese: 「昨日言った宿題」、もうしました。
    english: '"The homework I told you about yesterday," I''ve already done it.'
    register: polite
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「ました」 makes the sentence polite. The 「もう」 signifies the completion of the homework.
  - japanese: ねえ、もう私のこと好きになった?
    english: Hey, do you like me already?
    register: flirty
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The 「ねえ」 is a casual way to get someone's attention. The use of 「もう」 implies a hopeful expectation
      or a playful impatience regarding the development of feelings.
  - japanese: この前話した映画、もう観た?もしよかったら、今度一緒に行かない?
    english: That movie we talked about before, have you seen it yet? If you're free, wouldn't you like
      to go together sometime?
    register: semi-formal
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Using 「もう」 here gently inquires if the listener has already seen the movie, setting up a potential
      invitation for a future outing. The phrase 「もしよかったら、今度一緒に行かない?」 is a common way to suggest going
      out without being too forceful.
  - japanese: すみません、その件については、もう対応済みです。
    english: Excuse me, regarding that matter, it has already been handled.
    register: business
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「すみません」 is a polite way to start a sentence. 「対応済みです」 indicates that the action has already
      been completed. 「もう」 emphasizes the completion.
  - japanese: あの店、もう閉まっちゃった。
    english: That shop has already closed.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「～ちゃった」 is a contraction of 「～てしまった」 and expresses a sense of completion, often with a nuance
      of regret or finality. 「もう」 reinforces the 'already closed' aspect.
  - japanese: 昔はよくこの公園で遊んだものだけど、もう来なくなっちゃったなあ。
    english: I used to play in this park often, but I don't come here anymore.
    register: reflective
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「～ものだけど」 indicates a nostalgic recollection of the past. 「もう来なくなっちゃった」 uses 「もう」
      in a negative context to mean 'not anymore', combined with 「～なくなっちゃった」 to express that the action
      of coming here has ceased, tinged with a bit of wistfulness. The 「なあ」 at the end also contributes
      to the melancholic and reflective tone.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in the examples, もう is quite flexible. It can express a simple completion
  of an action, a sense of finality, or even exasperation. Pay attention to the context and the surrounding
  words to fully grasp the intended meaning.
false_friends:
  - term: まだ
    meaning: Still, Not yet
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike もう, まだ indicates that something is still ongoing or has not yet happened.
  - term: すでに
    meaning: Already, Too late
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to もう, すでに often carries a stronger sense of "it's too late" or "it's a done
      deal," and is generally more formal than もう.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that まだ focuses on what hasn't finished or started
  yet, whereas もう emphasizes the unexpected completion or cessation of something. すでに is a more formal
  synonym for 'already' but can also imply that an action is irreversible or too late.
