  **さすが** (often written as 流石) is an adverb used to express the speaker's feeling of admiration or confirmation that something or someone has lived up to expectations or reputation. It conveys a sense of "as expected of (A)" or "that's just like (A)". As an adverb, さすが can appear at the beginning of a sentence (with or without に) or directly before a noun with the particle の.

  **Important Consideration:** While generally positive, さすが can occasionally have a negative nuance, similar to "even" in English. In such cases, it implies that despite expectations, something or someone has failed or encountered difficulty, like saying, "even (A) couldn't (B)".

  **Etymology:** The kanji 流石 (ryūseki) for さすが is an example of 借字 (shakuji), which means "borrowed characters". The kanji were chosen for their phonetic similarity to the word, not for their literal meanings.

  - term: はたして
    meaning: Wonder if ~ (really)?, Wonder how ~ (actually)?, Sure enough, As expected
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「さすが」 which expresses confirmation or admiration of something living up to expectations,
      「はたして」 often expresses doubt or questioning before confirming something as expected.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「さすが」 and 「はたして」 can translate to "as expected", 「はたして」 often carries
  an initial sense of uncertainty or questioning before confirmation, whereas 「さすが」 directly expresses
  the feeling of something meeting expectations.
