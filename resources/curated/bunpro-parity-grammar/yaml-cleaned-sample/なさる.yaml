writeup: |-
  なさる is an **honorific language** verb that acknowledges and respects the actions of another (never the speaker). Like お～になる, なさる has exactly the same meaning as する. なさる can be utilized in any situation where する would be used, as a direct replacement. It is a special-class verb, which means that it has some unique conjugation rules. In its casual form, it will conjugate in exactly the same way as a う-Verb. However, in the polite form, instead of る changing to り (as would be expected of a う-Verb), it will change to い instead.

  **Caution:** Although some Japanese speakers will use it, expressions like なさっていらっしゃる are considered **double keigo** (なさる is honorific language, and いらっしゃる is also honorific language), and are technically incorrect. However, なさる may be partnered with ます, which is simply polite speech.

  **Fun Fact:** なさる is considered a little bit old fashioned in modern Japanese, and お～になる is the preferred form used by most native speakers.

  - term: する
    meaning: To do, To make into
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「する」 is the basic verb "to do." 「なさる」 is its honorific equivalent, used to show respect.
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse 「なさる」 with other verbs meaning "to do." 「いたす」 is
  the humble form for your own actions, 「なさい」 is a command, and 「お～になる」 is another common honorific form.
  Remember to use 「なさる」 only when speaking about someone else's actions to show respect. 「する」 is the plain
  form and doesn't carry the same connotation of respect.
