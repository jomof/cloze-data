writeup: |-
  っこない is formed by attaching the suffix **っこ** to the conjunctive form (連用形) of a verb, followed by the い-adjective **ない**. This combination creates a new い-adjective that emphatically expresses the impossibility of the verb's action. It conveys a strong sense that there is absolutely no chance of something happening. Common translations include "there is no chance of (verb)," or "doing (verb) is impossible."

  **Important Consideration:** While extremely rare, because っこ originates from the kanji 子 (child), you might occasionally encounter this grammar point written in kanji as 子ない.
