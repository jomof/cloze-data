  使用域: 一般
writeup: だけに is used to express that something is natural, expected, or even more so, given a certain
  reason or situation. Think of it as saying "it's only natural that..." or "precisely because...". It
  connects a reason (A) to a result (B), emphasizing the causal link and the expected nature of the outcome.
  It can be used for both positive and negative outcomes. It attaches directly to verbs in their dictionary
  form, い-adjectives, nouns, and な-adjectives (where the な is included). The nuance is often one of highlighting
  a predictable consequence or an intensification of the reason.

  *because of* a specific reason. わけだ explains *why* something is the case. だけあって emphasizes the expected
  outcome due to a recognized quality. だけのことはある confirms an expectation *after* the fact, validating something's
  worth or reputation.
