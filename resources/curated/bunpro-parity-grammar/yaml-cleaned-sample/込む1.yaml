writeup: The verb 込む (komu) is used as a suffix added to the conjunctive form (連用形 - ren'yōkei) of other
  verbs. In this usage, it primarily conveys the idea of **physically entering** or **putting something
  into** a space or container. Think of it as "jamming" something in. While 込む has other meanings, this

post_example_writeup: Remember that while 込む can have other meanings like 'to do thoroughly,' in this
  specific usage, it emphasizes the physical act of entering or inserting.

  - term: 込む ②
    meaning: Remain, To do thoroughly, Deeply, Intensely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 込む ①, 込む ② doesn't focus on the physical action of entering, but rather on the depth
      or intensity of an action or state.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between the different meanings of 込む, pay attention to
  the context of the sentence. If the verb before 込む describes a physical movement into a space, it's
  likely 込む ①. If it describes the degree or intensity of an action, it's probably 込む ②.
