  と言える is a common expression that utilizes the potential form of the verb 言う "to say", to highlight that it is possible for something to be said. This phrase is often used to express a general idea about something that the speaker believes to be correct. 言える translates as "it is fair to say (A)", or "one could say (A)". As the case marking particle と is being used in its 引用 (citation) use, 言える may follow any direct phrase/statement.

  と言える is regularly seen paired with grammar patterns like だろう, or でしょう. This makes the overall statement more friendly, by considering the listener's thoughts about the issue being presented. 言えるだろう can simply be translated as "can we not say (A)?", or "(A) can be said, right?".

  **Caution:** When the potential form of 言う is linked with the auxiliary verb よう, it creates a much stronger phrase that is similar to "let it be said that (A)".

  **Fun Fact:** The speaker is usually relatively confident about their statement when using と言える, but the usage of a form that expresses conjecture shows that they are open to the possibility of being wrong, thus softening the tone.

  - term: といってもいい
    meaning: You could say, You might say
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 言える, といってもいい has a slightly stronger nuance of permissibility or suggestion, implying
      that it's acceptable to say something, whereas 言える focuses on the possibility or fairness of saying
      it.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 言える and といってもいい indicate that something can be said, they have
  subtle differences. Use 言える when you want to emphasize the possibility or fairness of a statement. Use
  といってもいい when you want to suggest that a particular way of saying something is acceptable or reasonable.
