writeup: |-
  The adverb **わざわざ** (wazawaza) expresses that someone has taken extra effort or gone out of their way to do something. It conveys a sense of deliberate action beyond what was strictly necessary. It can be translated as "expressly," "especially," "to go out of one's way to," or "to take the trouble to." It often appears at the beginning of a sentence to highlight this extra effort. While generally carrying a positive nuance of thoughtfulness or kindness, it can also be used in situations where the extra effort seems unnecessary or even bothersome, giving it a slightly negative connotation.

  **Fun Fact:** Although rarely used, わざわざ can be written as **態態**, where 態 (tai) means "purpose" or "intent." This kanji reinforces the idea that the action was driven by a specific intention.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  The nuance of わざわざ depends heavily on the context. It can express gratitude for someone's thoughtfulness or mild annoyance at unnecessary effort.
  *  Be careful not to confuse it with **わざと** (wazato), which means "on purpose" and has a stronger implication of intentionality, often with a negative connotation.

  - term: わざと
    meaning: Intentionally, On purpose
    kind: adverb
    nuance: Unlike 「わざわざ」, 「わざと」 specifically means "on purpose" and often implies a deliberate act, sometimes
      with a negative intention. While 「わざわざ」 focuses on the extra effort taken, 「わざと」 emphasizes the
      intent behind the action.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「わざわざ」 and 「わざと」, remember that 「わざわざ」 highlights the **extra
  effort** someone made, while 「わざと」 emphasizes the **intentionality** of an action. If you want to express
  that someone went out of their way, use 「わざわざ」. If you want to say something was done on purpose, use
  「わざと」.
