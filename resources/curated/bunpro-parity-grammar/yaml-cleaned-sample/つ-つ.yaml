writeup: |-
  つ is a conjunction particle in Japanese that is used in constructions where it will appear twice, highlighting contrasting verbs. This つ～つ structure is often translated as "to be doing (A) and (B) over and over", where the actions are happening repeatedly one after the other. つ will connect to the conjunctive form of verbs, with (A) and (B) generally appearing in direct sequence.

  Additionally, it is also quite common to see the same verb being repeated in both places. When this happens, the (A) verb will be in the standard form, while the (B) verb will be in the passive form. This translates as "to do (A) and to have (A) done to oneself", expressing a reciprocal action or a state of mutual dependence.

  **Important Consideration:** This grammar pattern is only used with a limited set of words in modern Japanese. Here is a list of some standard combinations:

  *  **行きつ戻りつ** - To go back and forth.
  *  **浮きつ沈みつ** - To surface and submerge (to bob).
  *  **見えつ隠れつ** - To go in and out of sight.
  *  **とつおいつ** (from 取りつ置きつ) - To waver between.
  *  **矯めつ眇めつ** - To take a good look.
  *  **組んず解れつ** - To intertwine and release (to grapple).
  *  **抜きつ抜かれつ** - To pull away and be pulled away from (to be neck and neck).
  *  **持ちつ持たれつ** - To have and to be held (to give and take).
  *  **押しつ押されつ** - To press and be pressed.
  *  **追いつ追われつ** - To overtake and be overtaken.
  *  **差しつ差されつ** - To pour and be poured (to take turns exchanging drinks).
