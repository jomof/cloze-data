  **とき** (時 in kanji) is a noun meaning "when" or "at the time of." It connects two clauses, indicating the timing of an event. It's used for events that occur at regular intervals (habits, hobbies) or specific moments/events.

  To use **とき**, attach it to the end of a clause. Remember to use **な** after な-adjectives and **の** after nouns. The particle **に** often follows **とき** when another verb follows.

  **Important Consideration:** **とき** emphasizes the sequence of events, describing one thing leading to another. It's not typically used for ongoing states or conditions that were true during the first action. For example, saying "the time you tripped over a log on Tuesday" would sound unnatural with **とき** because "Tuesday" is a state of being, not an action.
