etymology: 「あとで」 is formed from the noun 後 (ato), meaning "after" or "behind," and the particle で (de),
  indicating means or manner. Essentially, it means "by means of what comes after" or "in the state of
  being after."
writeup: |-
  「あとで」 is an adverbial phrase that means **"after"** or **"later."** It indicates that an action will occur at some point following a specific event or the present moment. Think of 後 (ato) as signifying what comes "behind" in a sequence. The で (de) particle here functions to indicate the time or state in which something happens. You can use 「あとで」 in a few ways:

  *  Attached to a **noun followed by の**: This specifies that something will happen after that noun. For example, 「仕事の後で」 (shigoto no ato de - after work).
  *  Attached to a **past-tense verb**: This indicates that something will happen after the completion of that verb. For example, 「食べた後で」 (tabeta ato de - after eating).
  *  At the **beginning of a sentence**: This means "later" in a general sense, referring to a time after the present moment. For example, 「あとで買い物に行きます」 (ato de kaimono ni ikimasu - I will go shopping later).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  「あとで」 implies a delay, but the duration of that delay isn't specified. It could be a few minutes or several days.
  *  While similar to 「てから」, 「あとで」 has a slightly less formal feel and focuses more on the time *after* an event, rather than the sequential order emphasized by 「てから」.

  - term: まえに
    meaning: Before, In front of
    kind: antonym

      or location.
  - term: てから
    meaning: Once...is done, Once...happens, After doing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both 「あとで」 and 「てから」 mean "after," 「てから」 emphasizes the sequential order and the completion
      of the first action before the second. 「あとで」 focuses more on the time *after* the event.
  - term: たら
    meaning: When, From when, Just when, If
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「たら」 can mean "after" in certain contexts, but it often carries a conditional nuance of "when
      X happens, then Y." 「あとで」 simply indicates a later time without necessarily implying a condition.
  - term: 上で
    meaning: After, Upon
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「上で」 also means "after," but it often implies that the first action is a necessary preliminary
      step for the second action. 「あとで」 has a broader meaning and doesn't necessarily suggest a prerequisite.

    meaning: The former ~ the latter, The first ~ the second
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「後者は」 specifically refers to the latter of two things mentioned. While related to the concept

      following an event.
post_false_friends_writeup: While some of these expressions share a similar meaning to 「あとで」, it's important
  to understand their specific nuances. 「まえに」 is the direct opposite, indicating something happens before.
  「てから」 emphasizes the sequence of actions. 「たら」 often implies a conditional relationship. 「上で」 suggests
  a necessary preceding step. 「後者は」 is for comparing two specific items. Pay attention to the context
  to choose the most appropriate word.
