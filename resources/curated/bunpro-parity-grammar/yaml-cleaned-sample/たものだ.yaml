writeup: As introduced in the ものだ lesson, the combination of the noun 物 "thing" with the auxiliary verb
  だ forms an expression indicating a strong determination or a sense of what is natural or expected. Extending
  this nuance, **たものだ** is used with verbs in the past tense to express a recollection of past habits
  or frequently occurring events. It carries a nuance of nostalgia, reminiscence, or introspection, suggesting
  the speaker is reflecting on something meaningful from their past. The literal sense is closer to "(something)
  was the way things used to be." It's important to note that **たものだ** is typically used for events or
  experiences that hold some significance for the speaker. For recalling past events that are considered
  inconsequential or lack personal importance, **たことがある** is more appropriate.

    conjugation: past (plain)
    register: standard
    setting: informative
    nuance: While grammatically correct, this sentence sounds a bit unnatural with 「ものだ」 because going
      to school daily is a normal, expected event and doesn't carry a strong sense of personal recollection
      or significance. It lacks the nostalgic or introspective nuance typically associated with this grammar
      point.
  - japanese: 昔は毎日のように親父とけんかをしたものだ。
    english: In the past, I fought with my father almost every day.
    conjugation: past (plain)

      experience that the speaker might reflect upon.
  - japanese: 多分子供の頃に食べたことがある。
    english: I may have eaten this when I was a kid.
    register: casual

      a young age isn't presented as a particularly memorable or significant event.
  - japanese: 子供の頃はよく、神社で遊んだ事がある。
    english: When I was a kid, I often played at the shrine.
    register: casual

      the speaker's phrasing suggests a more casual recollection without strong emotional attachment.

    conjugation: past (polite)

      sense of past habit and reflection.

    setting: informative
    nuance: Here, 「ものだ」 is used to describe a past custom or practice, contrasting it with the present
      situation. It highlights a significant change in how things were done.
post_example_writeup: Notice how the sentences using **たものだ** often express a personal reflection or a
  memory that holds some emotional weight for the speaker. The example about going to school every day
  feels less natural because it's a routine activity without particular emotional significance. This distinction
  is key to understanding when to use **たものだ** versus other expressions for past actions.
false_friends:
  - term: たことがある
    meaning: Have done before
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **たものだ**, **たことがある** simply states a past experience without necessarily implying a
      habitual action or a strong sense of nostalgia or introspection. It's used for events that the speaker
      has done at least once.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between **たものだ** and **たことがある**, consider the speaker's
  intent. If they are reminiscing about a past habit or something that was common in their past, and if
  there's a nuance of nostalgia or reflection, **たものだ** is appropriate. If they are simply stating that
  they have done something at least once before, without that sense of habitual past or emotional connection,
  **たことがある** is the better choice.
