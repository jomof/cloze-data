  To express that something "was" a certain way in Japanese, you use **だった** (casual) or **でした** (polite) after a noun or a な-adjective. This is a combination of the auxiliary verb **だ** (or **です** in its polite form) with the past tense auxiliary verb **た**. For **だった**, the base form of **だ** becomes **だっ** before adding **た**. For **でした**, the **す** of **です** changes to **し** before adding **た**.

  **Important Caution:** You cannot use **だった** or **でした** with い-adjectives. い-adjectives have their own past tense conjugation.

  - term: う-Verb (Past)
    meaning: Past tense form of う-verbs
    kind: grammatical concept
    nuance: Unlike 「だった・でした」 which attaches to nouns and な-adjectives, the past tense of う-verbs is formed
      by conjugating the verb itself (e.g., 「行く」 becomes 「行った」).
  - term: だ
    meaning: To be, Is (plain form)
    kind: related form
    nuance: Unlike 「だった」, 「だ」 is the present tense plain form of the verb 'to be'.
  - term: です
    meaning: To be, Is (polite form)
    kind: related form
    nuance: Unlike 「でした」, 「です」 is the present tense polite form of the verb 'to be'.
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse the past tense forms 「だった・でした」 with the present
  tense forms 「だ・です」. Also, remember that verbs have their own distinct past tense conjugations that don't
  involve 「だった・でした」.
