writeup: The grammar point **につき** is a formal expression derived from に and the conjunctive form of the
  verb 就(つ)く, meaning "to take up" or "to assume". While 就く often refers to assuming a position, **につき**
  functions primarily to express reasons or per-item limitations. It translates to "due to," "on account
  of," or "per" and directly follows a noun. This structure indicates that the subsequent part of the
  sentence is a direct consequence or arrangement made **because of** or **in relation to** the preceding
  noun. Its formality makes it common in official announcements, notices, and business communications.
  The underlying sense of "attaching to" or being directly connected to the preceding noun remains central
  to its usage.

  important to note the subtle differences. **につき** is strictly formal and factual, often found in official
  announcements. Expressions like ために are more versatile and can be used in everyday conversation. Expressions
  like おかげで and せいで carry positive and negative connotations, respectively, which **につき** lacks. Similarly,
  expressions like にあたり focus on timing, and について introduces a topic, distinguishing them from **につき**'s
  function of stating a direct cause or per-item basis.
