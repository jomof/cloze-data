  **では**, **それでは**, and **じゃあ** are conjunctions in Japanese used to indicate a transition or consequence. **それでは** is the most formal of the three, with **では** being a slightly less formal abbreviation, and **じゃあ** being the most casual. They can signal a continuation of the same topic, where the second part is a result or conclusion of the first, or a shift to a new topic.

  - When used to continue the same topic, it implies a logical progression or consequence, similar to saying "therefore" or "in that case."
  - When used to change the topic, it often indicates a natural breaking point or a shift in focus, similar to saying "well then" or "okay."

  A useful way to think about it is that something has been established or understood, and **では/それでは/じゃあ** is used to move forward based on that understanding. These phrases are also commonly used as a polite way to end a conversation, similar to saying "well, I should get going" in English.

    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「では・それでは・じゃあ」, 「さ」 is more of an interjection and can express a range of emotions or
      intentions, often related to starting something or prompting action, rather than indicating a logical
      consequence or transition as directly.

    nuance: While 「さて」 is similar to 「では・それでは・じゃあ」 in introducing a new topic or moving forward, it often

      change in focus compared to the more general transition signaled by 「では」.
