writeup: |-
  **一方だ (ippou da)** is used to describe a situation where something is continuously changing in a single direction. It conveys the idea of "more and more," "continuing to," or "getting -er and -er." It's a more formal expression.

  Think of 一方 (ippou) as meaning "one direction." This grammar point emphasizes that the change is not fluctuating or reversing; it's steadily progressing in one way.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The verb preceding 一方だ must express some kind of **change**. Verbs like 増える (fueru - to increase), 減る (heru - to decrease), 悪くなる (waruku naru - to get worse), 良くなっていく (yoku natte iku - to get better) are commonly used.
  *  一方だ itself does not express the change, but rather the continuous nature of that change.
  *  The register is considered formal or stiff (硬い - katai).
  *  The sentence often ends with だ or its conjunctive form で when followed by an explanation.

post_example_writeup: Remember that the verb used with 一方だ must indicate a change. Using it with a verb
  that doesn't inherently express change will sound unnatural. For instance, saying 「子供が怪我をして泣く一方だ。」 sounds
  odd because 「泣く」 (naku - to cry) itself doesn't inherently express a change in state in the same way
  that, for example, 「泣き叫ぶようになる」 (naki sakebu you ni naru - to start crying and screaming) does.

      is absent in 一方だ.
  - term: つづける
    meaning: To continue

      一方だ focuses on the continuous, unidirectional aspect of the change.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 一方だ emphasizes the continuous and directional
  nature of a change. While other expressions like どんどん or ますます might also describe increasing trends,
  they have different nuances. 一方で signals a contrast or simultaneity, つづける is a verb for continuing,
  and ば〜ほど describes a proportional relationship. Focus on the 'single direction' aspect of 一方 to distinguish
  it from these other expressions.
