writeup: The grammar point **ばかりに** expresses the idea of something happening "simply because" or "just
  because" of a particular reason. It highlights that the stated reason is the sole or primary cause of
  a subsequent event, often with a nuance of surprise or an unexpected outcome. Literally, it can be understood
  as "even with just (A), (B) is/was able to occur." It is typically used with verbs in the past tense,
  indicating that the cause has already occurred. To use **ばかりに**, simply attach it to the end of a word
  in its attributive form (the plain form for verbs and i-adjectives, な-adjectives with な, and nouns with
  の). While not strictly required, **ばかりに** often accompanies negative results. However, it can also express
  strong desire or enthusiasm when used with expressions like **たい** (want to do) or **ほしい** (want something).
