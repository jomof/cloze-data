writeup: '**とも** is a particle indicating that something will happen or be true regardless of the preceding
  condition. It conveys the meaning of "even if" or "no matter what." It often emphasizes that the outcome
  remains the same despite the circumstances. As a conjunctional particle, **とも** typically follows the
  volitional form (う/よう form) of verbs or the conjunctive form of い-adjectives (く form). It can also follow
  the 何 form of question words (何, 誰, etc.) combined with か, or expressions like いくら. The basic structure
  is **[Verb in volitional form]とも**, **[い-Adjective in conjunctive form]とも**, **[Question word + か]とも**,
  or **[いくら]とも**.'

  a stronger sense of "no matter what" or "regardless of." The preceding verb or adjective is presented
  as a condition that, despite its presence, won't alter the outcome or the speaker's stance.

post_false_friends_writeup: While these grammar points share the idea of something happening regardless
  of a condition, they have subtle differences in nuance and emphasis. **とも** is a straightforward way
  to say "even if" or "no matter what." 「ようが～まいが」 highlights a choice between two options. 「にしても」 often
  acknowledges a fact. 「たとえ〜ても」 sets up a clear hypothetical, and 「どうしても」 emphasizes will or inevitability.
  Pay attention to the context to choose the most appropriate expression.
