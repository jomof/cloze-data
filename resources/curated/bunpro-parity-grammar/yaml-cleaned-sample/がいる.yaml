writeup: |-
  がいる is a common construction combining the particle が and the verb いる. This expression means "to exist" or "there is" and is used for living/animate things. Because the things described are alive (or operated by something alive), いる is the appropriate verb. ある is used for non-living things. The polite form of いる is います. The removal of the る indicates that いる is a る-Verb (Ichidan verb). The kanji form 居る is common and should be learned early to avoid reading confusion. There's no nuance difference between using the kanji or not; it's writer preference.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The が in がいる is often omitted in casual speech or informal writing (like manga or instant messaging).

  - term: がある
    meaning: To be, There is
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike がいる, がある is used for inanimate objects and abstract concepts.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that いる (and がいる) is for living things, while
  ある (and がある) is for non-living things. Think of いる for people and animals, and ある for objects and ideas.
