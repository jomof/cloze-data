writeup: |-
  にかたくない is a formal grammar pattern that uses a different version of the い-Adjective 難しい "difficult", 難い, which has the same meaning. This adjective will be used in the negative, in order to indicate that something is "not difficult". The case-marking particle に at the beginning is limited to following verbs that indicate thinking or conjecture. This structure will only appear with quite a limited number of verbs, with 想像 "to imagine", 予想 "to predict", 察する "to infer" or "to sense", 理解 "to understand", and 推測 "to guess" making up the majority of them.

  **Fun Fact:** Many words have alternative forms that will be described as (A) の改まった表現 "the reformed version of (A)" in Japanese dictionaries. Although the standard meaning of the る-Verb 改まる is "to redo", it can also often be "to reform" in the sense of making something ceremonious or formal. (A) will usually be the far more common or everyday version of a word, such as with 難しい in the case of this grammar point.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  This grammar point is quite formal and primarily used in written language or formal speech.
  *  The verbs that precede に難くない are limited to those involving thought processes.
