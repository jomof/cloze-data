  The grammar point **ことに** expresses a strong degree of a particular feeling or emotion. It translates to meanings like "extremely," "especially," or "to my..." indicating a heightened sense of the described emotion. It's formed by attaching the particle に to the noun 事 (**koto**, meaning "thing"), essentially meaning "in particular." This structure often emphasizes the extent or degree of the feeling being described.

  You'll frequently see **ことに** used after adjectives (both い-adjectives and な-adjectives) and verbs. A literal translation of "(A) ことに (B)" can often be understood as "to a particularly (A) extent, (B)."

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Focus on Feelings:** Remember that **ことに** in this usage is almost exclusively used to describe feelings or emotions.
  *  **幸いなことに:** The expression **幸いなことに** (saiwai na koto ni) is a common set phrase that uses this grammar and translates to "fortunately" or "luckily."
  *  **Adverbial Usage:** Less commonly, you might see **ことに** (written as 殊に - koto ni) used at the beginning of a sentence as an adverb, similar to **特に** (tokuni), meaning "particularly" or "especially." This usage is distinct from the grammar point focused on expressing feelings.
