  **より～のほうが** is used to express a preference or comparison, indicating that one option is "more (adjective)" than another. Think of it like saying "A is more (adjective) than B."

  *  **より** translates to "than" in this construction. It always follows the item being compared against.
  *  **のほうが** follows the item being preferred and emphasizes that this option is "more" something. The adjective describing the comparison comes after **のほうが**.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While **のほうが** is most common, sometimes the particle **が** is replaced by **を**, particularly with verbs expressing desire like **たい** (want to do) and **ほしい** (want).
  *  With **たい**, both **を** and **が** sound natural, with **が** focusing on the action and **を** on the object.
  *  With **ほしい** (wanting a thing), **が** is generally more natural, though **を** is also acceptable.
  *  When **より** appears alone or not directly linked to the preceding word, it can have a different meaning, similar to "relatively" or "in general comparison." In such cases, the **のほうが** is implied but not explicitly stated.

false_friends:
  - term: ほど～ない
    meaning: Is not as…as, Isn't... like..., Not to the extent of...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **より～のほうが** which directly states one thing is more than another, **ほど～ない** expresses
      that something is *not* as much as something else. For example, 「寿司はラーメンほど高くない」 (Sushi is not as
      expensive as ramen).
  - term: より
    meaning: More than, Over
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While **より** means "than," on its own it doesn't explicitly state the preferred option like
      **より～のほうが**. For example, 「彼は私より背が高い」 (He is taller than me). This just establishes a comparison
      without the nuance of preference.
  - term: たほうがいい
    meaning: It'd be better to, Should do
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both express preference, **たほうがいい** is used for giving advice or suggesting a better
      course of action. **より～のほうが** is a direct comparison of two things. For example, 「病院へ行ったほうがいい」 (You
      should go to the hospital).
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **より～のほうが** is specifically for comparing
  two items and stating which one is more of a certain quality. **ほど～ない** focuses on what something *isn't*,
  while **たほうがいい** is about suggesting an action.
