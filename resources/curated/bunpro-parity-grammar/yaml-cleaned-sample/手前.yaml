writeup: The noun 「手前」(temae) primarily means "in front of" or "before". However, it also carries a nuanced
  meaning of "from one's standpoint" or "because of the situation one is in". When used with a verb, often
  with the pattern 「～手前、～」 or 「～手前～わけにはいかない」, it implies a sense of obligation, responsibility, or constraint
  due to the preceding situation. Think of it as being "in a position where" you have to do something
  or can't do something. When used with a noun and the particle 「の」, such as 「名詞の手前」, it literally means
  "in front of (noun)". It can also indicate considering someone's presence or position.

  - term: まえに
    meaning: Before, In front of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「前に」 can also mean "before" or "in front of", it generally lacks the nuance of obligation
      or constraint that 「手前」 often carries when used in the 「～手前、～」 pattern. 「前に」 is a more general term
      for spatial or temporal precedence.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, consider the context. If you want to simply express something
  being physically in front or occurring before something else, 「前に」 is usually sufficient. If you want
  to emphasize the speaker's position, obligation, or the social pressures influencing a situation, 「手前」
  is more appropriate. The 「～手前～わけにはいかない」 pattern is a strong indicator that 「手前」 is the correct choice.
