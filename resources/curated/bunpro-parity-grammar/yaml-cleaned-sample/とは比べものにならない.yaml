writeup: |-
  「とは比べものにならない」 is used to emphasize that something (B) is far superior to something else (A), to the point where a comparison is almost meaningless. Think of it as saying "there's just no comparing the two." The structure is: **[A]とは[B]は比べものにならない**.

  *  **とは**: The particle と marks the thing being compared against, and は sets it as the topic of the sentence.
  *  **比べもの**: This literally means "a comparable thing." It's a noun formed from the conjunctive form of the verb 比(くら)べる (to compare) and the noun 物(もの) (thing).
  *  **に**: This is a case-marking particle, in this context indicating the target of the verb.
  *  **ならない**: This is the negative form of the verb なる (to become). So, the whole phrase essentially means "(B) does not become a comparable thing to (A)."

  This grammar point is often used to express a significant difference in quality, quantity, or some other measurable aspect. Because it's emphatic, it suggests a large disparity between the two things being discussed.

  Sometimes you'll see an extra は before ならない (e.g., とは比べものにはならない). This adds even more emphasis or highlights the contrast.
