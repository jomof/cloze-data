writeup: 「や否や」 indicates that something happens immediately after a previous action. It conveys the sense
  of "as soon as" or "no sooner than." The structure is **verb (dictionary form) + や否や + [result]**. The
  second action often happens spontaneously or unexpectedly following the first. It's a **formal** expression,
  typically found in written Japanese, news articles, or more formal speech. The literal sense can be
  understood as "at the point when it's not certain whether [the action] will happen or not, [the result
  occurs]." Note that while 「や否や」 is the complete form, sometimes the 「否や」 part is omitted, leaving just
  **verb (dictionary form) + や**, with the same meaning.
