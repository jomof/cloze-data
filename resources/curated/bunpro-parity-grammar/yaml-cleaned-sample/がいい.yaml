meaning: You should, It would be good to
details:
  Register: Authoritative, often used by someone in a perceived higher position.
  Literal meaning: Doing [verb] would be good.
writeup: |-
  「がいい」 is a combination of the case-marking particle 「が」 and the *i*-adjective 「いい」 (**good**). While it can be translated as "you should" or "it would be good to", it carries a strong nuance of the speaker being in a position of authority or perceived superiority. The literal meaning is closer to "doing [verb] would be good". The verb precedes 「がいい」 in its dictionary form.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Due to its authoritative tone, 「がいい」 sounds very commanding or even pompous. It's often used by characters like kings, emperors, or wise figures in fiction.
  *  In real-life conversations, using 「がいい」 directly can sound arrogant or condescending. It implies that the speaker's suggestion is the only correct course of action.
  *  The kanji form 「良い」 is often used for 「いい」 in this grammatical structure, further emphasizing its formal or literary feel.
  *  Think of 「がいい」 as a much stronger and more presumptuous version of 「たほうがいい」 ("you should do [verb]").

    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: authoritative
    setting: sympathetic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: While seemingly sympathetic, 「寝るがいい」 still carries a tone of authority, as if the speaker's
      suggestion is the only acceptable option.
  - japanese: 俺の言うことを素直に聞くがいい。
    english: You should just honestly listen to what I say.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: authoritative
    setting: commanding
    speaker_gender: male

    nuance: 「俺の言うこと」 is a masculine way of saying "what I say". The phrase 「聞くがいい」 strongly emphasizes
      the speaker's demand for obedience.

    register: formal
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Using 「お嬢さん」 is a polite way to address a young woman. 「見せるがいい」 here, while still having a
      hint of authority, is softened to sound more like an encouraging flirtation.

    speaker_gender: male

      and the speaker's intention might be to playfully encourage relaxation.

    nuance: 「言うがいい」 in this context is a playful, slightly commanding way of encouraging the listener.
      The speaker is confident and subtly taking charge.
post_example_writeup: While the examples above show various contexts, remember that 「がいい」 inherently carries
  a tone of authority. Use it cautiously in real-life conversations, especially with people you're not
  close to or who are in a higher position than you.
false_friends:
  - term: たほうがいい
    meaning: You should (softer suggestion)
    kind: grammatical structure
    nuance: Unlike 「がいい」, 「たほうがいい」 offers advice or a suggestion without the strong implication of authority.
      It's a more common and polite way to say "you should".
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember the level of authority implied. 「たほうがいい」 is your
  go-to for general advice, while 「がいい」 is reserved for situations where you either have authority or
  are playfully mimicking it.
