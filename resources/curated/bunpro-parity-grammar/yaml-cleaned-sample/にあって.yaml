writeup: にあって is a relatively formal Japanese grammar construction that indicates a specific time, place,
  situation, or condition in which something occurs. It combines the particle に, indicating location or
  time, and あって, which is the te-form of the verb ある (to be). Therefore, にあって essentially means "being
  in a certain state or place." It often emphasizes the special or noteworthy nature of the situation.
  You'll often see it used when describing events happening during a particular period or under specific
  circumstances. Sometimes, も can follow にあって, subtly shifting the meaning to express that despite the
  noteworthy situation, a certain outcome is observed. It's **important** to distinguish this にあって from
  the て-form of the verb 遭う (あう - to encounter, often something negative), as seen in phrases like 事故にあって
  (jikō ni atte - having an accident).

  - term: ために
    meaning: Due to, Because of, As a result of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike にあって, ために directly indicates a cause-and-effect relationship. にあって focuses more on
      the situation or circumstances.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that にあって describes the setting or conditions,
  while ために explains the reason or cause. If you can replace the phrase with "because of" and the sentence
  still makes sense focusing on direct causation, then ために might be more appropriate. If the emphasis
  is on the circumstances surrounding an event, then にあって is likely the better choice.
