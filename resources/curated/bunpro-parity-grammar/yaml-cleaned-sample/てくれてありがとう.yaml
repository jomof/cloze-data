  「てくれてありがとう」 is used to thank someone for doing something specifically for the speaker's benefit. It builds upon the grammar point 「てくれる」, where someone does something for you or someone close to you. Adding 「ありがとう」 expresses gratitude for that action.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  This expression is used when the action done is seen as a favor or something that directly benefits the speaker.
  *  It's generally not used when thanking someone for something they are expected to do as part of their job or due to basic politeness. Using it in such situations can sound unnatural or even sarcastic.
examples:
  - japanese: いつもゴキブリを捕まえてくれてありがとう。
    english: Thank you for always catching the cockroaches for me.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of 「くれてありがとう」 emphasizes that catching cockroaches is something done specifically
      for the speaker's benefit, likely because they dislike or are afraid of them.

  - japanese: ケーキを買って来てくれてありがとう！

      the action was done for the speaker.

      job is to bag items. It's more appropriate if the listener went out of their way.

post_example_writeup: Remember that the nuance of 「てくれてありがとう」 lies in the fact that the action was done
  *for* the speaker. This implies a degree of favor or benefit.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb + て
    meaning: And, Then (Linking events)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「てくれてありがとう」, 「Verb + て」 simply connects two actions in sequence without necessarily
      implying that one action was done *for* someone's benefit. For example, 「起きて、朝ご飯を食べた」 means "I woke
      up and then ate breakfast."
  - term: くれる
    meaning: To give (me), To be given
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「てくれてありがとう」 uses 「くれる」, 「くれる」 itself is the verb meaning "to give (to me or someone
      close to me)". It indicates the direction of the action but doesn't inherently express gratitude.
  - term: てくれる
    meaning: To do something for someone (usually you)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「てくれる」 describes the act of doing something for someone. 「てくれてありがとう」 adds the expression of
      gratitude to this action. 「手伝ってくれる」 means "(someone) will help me", while 「手伝ってくれてありがとう」 means "Thank
      you for helping me."
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「てくれてありがとう」 specifically expresses thanks
  for an action done with the speaker's benefit in mind. While the other expressions are related, they
  don't inherently carry the same feeling of gratitude for a favor.
