writeup: 「てはいられない」 is a grammar pattern which consists of the conjunction-particle て, は, and the negated-potential
  form of the る-Verb いる 'to be'. Common translations include "to be unable to (A)", and "cannot afford
  to (A)". The literal meaning of "to not be able to be with (A)" reflects the impossibility of the action
  described by the verb. This structure is almost exclusively seen with verbs, but may occasionally be
  seen with い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns as well. The verb that 「てはいられない」 is connected to is often
  considered to be something that cannot continue due to either a time constraint or a feeling of urgency.
  In this way, it often has the nuance of "(A) cannot continue due to (B)", with the reason for (B) mentioned
  elsewhere in the sentence. When appearing with い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns, the nuance changes
  slightly and simply reflects the meaning of 「いられない」 itself, conveying that (A) "cannot be", or is "impossible"
  in some way. As always, 「ては」 will be replaced by 「では」 in the case of nouns and な-Adjectives.
