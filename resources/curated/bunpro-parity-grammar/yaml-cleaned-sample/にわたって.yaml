writeup: The grammar point 「にわたって」 is formed by the particle に followed by the て-form of the verb 渡る (わたる),
  meaning "to cross" or "to extend". It indicates that something spans **an entire area or period of time**.
  It can be translated as "across," "throughout," "extending through," or "over the period of." Because
  it originates from the verb 渡る, it inherently implies a complete traversal or coverage of the specified
  area or time. This structure is considered quite formal and is frequently encountered in news reports,
  articles, and official announcements. It's **important** to clearly define the span being referred to.

      「にわたって」 stresses the entirety of the period or area. 「にかけて」 can sometimes imply a less definite
      or broader timeframe compared to the more comprehensive sense of 「にわたって」.
post_false_friends_writeup: Both 「にわたって」 and 「にかけて」 refer to periods of time. However, to avoid confusion,
  remember that 「にわたって」 typically implies a complete coverage or extension throughout the entire duration
  or area being discussed. 「にかけて」 can sometimes have a slightly broader or more approximate feel to the
  timeframe.
