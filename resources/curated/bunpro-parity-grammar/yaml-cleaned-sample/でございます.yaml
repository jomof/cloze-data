writeup: |-
  As mentioned briefly in the 「ございます」 lesson, 「でございます」 is a structure that can be used as a replacement for 「であります」, the polite form of 「である」 (which itself is the formal equivalent of 「だ」). Both 「です」 and 「でございます」 are considered polite speech. However, 「でございます」 is the more polite of the two. It conveys a higher level of respect and formality. 「でござる」 may also be seen, as it is the base form of 「で」 + 「ございます」, a (special-class) verb. However, in modern Japanese, this is primarily restricted to historical dramas or characters with a somewhat 'quirky' personality.

  **Important Consideration:** Using 「でございます」 to introduce yourself is considered quite polite. However, when referring to other people, 「いらっしゃいます」 ('to be') is preferred, as honorific language is more respectful than polite speech in those situations.

  - term: だ
    meaning: To be, Is
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「でございます」, 「だ」 is a plain form and is considered casual. It's generally used with close
      friends and family or in informal writing.
  - term: です
    meaning: To be, Is
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「でございます」, 「です」 is a standard polite form. While polite, it doesn't carry the same level
      of formality and respect as 「でございます」.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「でございます」 with 「だ」 and 「です」, remember the level of politeness
  each conveys. 「だ」 is casual, 「です」 is standard polite, and 「でございます」 is highly polite and formal. Use
  「でございます」 in situations where you want to show extra respect, such as speaking to customers, superiors,
  or in formal announcements.
