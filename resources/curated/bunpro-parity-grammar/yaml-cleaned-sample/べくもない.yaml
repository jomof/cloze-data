  The grammar point 「べくもない」 expresses a strong sense of impossibility or certainty that something will not happen. It combines the conjunctive form 「べく」 of the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」 (expressing purpose, necessity, or likelihood) with the adverbial particle 「も」 and the negative い-adjective 「ない」. It conveys the speaker's firm belief that something is absolutely out of the question. This pattern often appears with verbs related to thinking, feeling, or judging, emphasizing the speaker's conviction that a certain outcome is impossible or inconceivable.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  「べくもない」 is generally used in formal or written contexts and sounds quite literary or stiff in casual conversation.
  *  For the verb 「する」, 「べく」 can attach directly to 「する」 or to its stem 「す」.

    conjugation: dictionary form
