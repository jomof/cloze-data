  「たる」 is a structure that indicates something "is (A)" in the same way as 「である」, and will often be translated as "(B) in the position of (A)", or "(B) as an (A)". 「たる」 itself is a combination of 「たる」, which is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「たり」, and the case marking particle 「に」. 「たる」 will appear after a noun marking some sort of position, with a statement about that position following after. It may be used either positively or negatively.

  「たる」 is not as common as 「たるもの」, which is a combination of 「たる」 and the noun 「者」, used to identify people. In these cases, 「(A)たる者」 will specifically mean "a person in the position of (A)", and generally describes what is appropriate for that position. This use may be translated as "for" or "as".

  Although this structure means "to be" in the same way as 「である」, the emphasis is far more on qualifications or expectations related to that position. Due to this, 「たる」 will not be used when simply stating that "(B) is (A)".

  **Caution:** Although 「たる」 does relate to the suitability of something being in a specific position, be careful not to confuse it with the う-Verb 「足る」 meaning "to be sufficient", or "to be worthy".

  **Fun Fact:** 「たり」 itself is a contraction of the case marking particle 「と」 and 「あり」 meaning "to be". This can be compared to 「なり」, which is a contraction of 「に」 and 「あり」.

  to 「たる」, it's important to remember the specific nuance of 「たる」 which emphasizes the inherent qualities,
  responsibilities, and expectations associated with a particular role or position. When considering these
  alternatives, think about whether the focus is on worthiness, a temporary role, a perspective, or simply
  stating a fact.
