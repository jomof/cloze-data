  The compound expression **かと思ったら** and **かと思うと** are used to describe a situation where something unexpected happens immediately after a thought or observation. It conveys a sense of surprise or a quick change of events, often contrary to the initial expectation. The literal sense is close to "just when I thought (A), (B) happened."

  *  **かと思うと** typically follows a verb in the dictionary form, or sometimes a noun. It emphasizes the immediacy of the change following the initial thought.
  *  **かと思ったら** usually follows a verb in the past tense, though dictionary form is also possible. It highlights the unexpected nature of the subsequent event after the initial observation.

  Essentially, both expressions highlight the contrast between what was expected or perceived and what actually occurred shortly after. The particle **か** adds a nuance of uncertainty or a fleeting thought. While **か** can be omitted, resulting in **と思うと** and **と思ったら**, the inclusion of **か** softens the tone slightly.

post_example_writeup: Both かと思ったら and かと思うと express a similar idea of something happening contrary to
  expectation, but there's a subtle difference in nuance. かと思うと often emphasizes the immediacy and almost
  simultaneous nature of the two events, while かと思ったら can sometimes imply a slightly longer duration before
  the unexpected event occurred. However, in many everyday situations, they are interchangeable.
false_friends:
  - term: なり
    meaning: As soon as, The moment, When
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike かと思ったら/かと思うと which emphasizes surprise at an unexpected event, なり focuses purely on
      the temporal sequence, indicating that something happened immediately after something else.
  - term: たとたんに
    meaning: The instant or moment, As soon as, Just as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar in expressing immediacy, たとたんに doesn't carry the same nuance of surprise or
      unexpectedness as かと思ったら/かと思うと. It simply states that something happened right after something else.
  - term: か〜ないかのうちに
    meaning: Right after, As soon as, Just when, Barely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: か〜ないかのうちに emphasizes the very short time interval between two events, often implying that
      the first action was not quite completed before the second occurred. かと思ったら/かと思うと focuses more on
      the unexpected nature of the second event.
  - term: 直ちに
    meaning: At once, Immediately, As soon as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 直ちに is a more formal way of expressing immediate action and doesn't inherently include the
      element of surprise or contrast in expectation that かと思ったら/かと思うと conveys.
  - term: と思いきや
    meaning: Thought...but, When...thought that...but, Despite having thought...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to かと思ったら/かと思うと in expressing a contrast with an initial thought, 思いきや strongly emphasizes
      the speaker's surprise at the unexpected outcome. However, 思いきや doesn't necessarily imply the same
      level of immediacy as かと思ったら/かと思うと.
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share the idea of one event following another in close
  succession, it's important to note the subtle differences. Expressions like なり, たとたんに, and か〜ないかのうちに
  primarily focus on the timing of events. 直ちに emphasizes immediacy in a more formal context. 思いきや highlights
  the speaker's surprise at a deviation from their expectation, but not necessarily with the same immediate,
  'right after' feeling of かと思ったら/かと思うと. Paying attention to these nuances will help you choose the most
  appropriate expression for your intended meaning.
