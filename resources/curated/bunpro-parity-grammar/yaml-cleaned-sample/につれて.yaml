  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
writeup: につれて, or に連れて when using kanji, expresses the idea that as one thing changes, another thing changes
  in proportion or as a consequence. It can be translated as "as (A), then (B)" or "in proportion to (A),
  (B)" or "(along) with (A), (B)". It's formed by attaching に to the dictionary form of a verb or a noun.
  The nuance is that the two events happen somewhat simultaneously and that the first event is the cause
  or the catalyst for the second. Think of it like a chain reaction. **Important Considerations:** The
  change described by につれて is often gradual. It's generally used for natural phenomena, changes over time,
  or development. Be mindful that the two events connected by につれて should have a logical connection; one
  should naturally lead to or occur with the other.

false_friends:
  - term: ともなると・にもなると
    meaning: When, If, Once, As
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike につれて, ともなると/にもなると often implies a change in situation or status that triggers a subsequent
      event or change. It can sometimes carry a stronger sense of conditionality or consequence than the
      proportional change suggested by につれて.
  - term: に伴って・に伴い
    meaning: As, Due to, Along with, Hand-in-hand with, Resulted in, Be consequent upon
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to につれて, に伴って/に伴い often implies a closer, more direct causal relationship or
      that the two events happen simultaneously as a pair. It can sometimes emphasize the impact or consequence
      of the first event more strongly than につれて.
  - term: にしたがって
    meaning: As, Following, As then, According to, In accordance with
    kind: synonym
    nuance: にしたがって has a stronger nuance of following a rule, guideline, or someone's instructions, in
      addition to expressing proportional change. While it can overlap with につれて, it emphasizes adherence
      or following a set path more so.
  - term: と (quotation)
    meaning: And
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While the literal translation of 連れて can involve "taking along," the simple conjunction と
      doesn't capture the sense of proportional or consequential change inherent in につれて. と simply links
      two separate items or actions.
  - term: と共に
    meaning: Together with, At the same time, As well as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: と共に emphasizes simultaneous occurrence or being together, but it doesn't necessarily imply
      the same proportional or causal relationship as につれて. と共に can be used for things that simply happen
      at the same time without one directly influencing the other in the same way.
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share some overlap in meaning with につれて, it's important
  to pay attention to the specific nuance each conveys. につれて specifically highlights a proportional or
  consequential change where one event gradually leads to another. Other expressions might emphasize conditionality,
  closer causal links, following a rule, simple simultaneity, or being together, which are distinct from
  the core meaning of につれて.
