  使用域: 敬語
etymology: This grammar point consists of お (or ご), a prefix used to add politeness, attached to the ます-stem
  of a verb, followed by になる (to become). Essentially, you are politely saying that someone "becomes"
  the state of doing that verb.
writeup: |-
  「お～になる」(or「ご～になる」) is an honorific expression used to show respect for the actions of the person you are speaking to or another person (never yourself). The 「になる」 part functions similarly to 「する」, attaching to the ます-stem of a verb. The primary difference between 「お」 and 「ご」 is based on the origin of the verb's root. 「お」 is used with words of Japanese origin (kun-yomi), while 「ご」 is used with words of Chinese origin (on-yomi). Both 「お」 and 「ご」 are represented by the kanji 御. One kun-yomi reading of 御 is 「お」, and one on-yomi reading is 「ご」.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Always use this grammar point to talk about others, never yourself.
  *  Pay attention to whether to use 「お」 or 「ご」 based on the verb's origin.

    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「お～になる」, 「いらっしゃる」 is a single verb that inherently carries honorific meaning for "to
      be," "to come," or "to go." You don't attach it to other verbs.
  - term: なさる
    meaning: To do (Honorific)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「お～になる」 which attaches to the ます-stem of other verbs, 「なさる」 is a standalone honorific
      verb meaning "to do."
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「いらっしゃる」 and 「なさる」 have similar honorific functions, 「お～になる」 is more
  versatile as it can be applied to a wider range of verbs by attaching to their ます-stem. 「いらっしゃる」 specifically
  covers the actions of being, coming, and going, while 「なさる」 specifically means 'to do'. Be mindful of
  the specific verb you want to use when choosing between these options.
