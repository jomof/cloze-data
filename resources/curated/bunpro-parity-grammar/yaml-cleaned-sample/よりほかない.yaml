writeup: Used in a similar way to しかない, よりほかない is a structure that emphasizes that only (A) is possible
  when attached to the end of verbs. This grammar pattern is a combination of the case marking particle
  より "than", or "from", the noun 他 "other", and the い-Adjective, ない. From this, it can be translated directly
  as "there is nothing other than (A)". However, the emphasis is usually on the impossibility of doing
  anything other than (A), rather than the existence of nothing else. Common interpretations include "to
  have no choice but to (A)", "there is no other way than (A)", or simply "have to (A)". Occasionally,
  the particles に, は, or a combination of both as には may come between 他 and ない. While this does not change
  the meaning, it does further emphasize the point that there is no choice but (A).
