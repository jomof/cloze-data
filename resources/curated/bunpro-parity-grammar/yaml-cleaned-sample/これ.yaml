writeup: これ is often considered the equivalent of "this" in English, and this is generally correct. これ
  is used to refer to something that is physically or emotionally close to the speaker. While translated
  as a "pronoun" in English, it's helpful to think of it as a **substitute noun** (代名詞 in Japanese), as
  that's always its function. これ stands in for a noun whose name is either understood from context, not
  needed in the sentence, or unknown to the speaker.
examples:
  - japanese: これはペンです。
    english: This is a pen.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: The 「です」 at the end makes this a polite and informative statement.
  - japanese: これは本だよ。
    english: This is a book.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The 「だよ」 at the end marks this as a casual, friendly statement.
  - japanese: これは寿司。
    english: This is sushi.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: A very casual, simple statement.
  - japanese: これも寿司です。
    english: This is also sushi.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「も」 indicates 'also'. The 「です」 makes it polite.

    english: Hey, I want to give this to you.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「ねえ」 is a way to get someone's attention intimately. 「～たいんだけど」 softens the statement and makes
      it sound like a heartfelt wish.
    etymology: 「君」 is a more intimate way to say 'you'.
  - japanese: これ、よかったら一緒にどうかな?
    english: If you'd like, how about we do this together?
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「よかったら」 is a polite way of saying 'if you like'. 「～どうかな」 is a softer way of making a suggestion
      or invitation.
  - japanese: 先輩、これは私が作った資料です。
    english: Senior, this is the document I created.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male

    nuance: 「先輩」 shows respect to a senior colleague. 「～ました」 is the polite past tense.
  - japanese: これは一体何なのですか?
    english: What on earth is this?
    register: formal
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: 「一体」 emphasizes the question, expressing surprise or confusion. 「～なのですか」 is a more formal
      way to ask 'what is it?'
false_friends:
  - term: この
    meaning: This
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike これ, この is a **determiner** (連体詞) and must be followed by a noun. You would say 「このペン」,
      not just 「この」 to mean 'this pen'.
  - term: ここ
    meaning: Here, This place
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike これ, ここ refers to a **location**. While both can refer to something near the speaker,
      ここ specifically denotes a place.
  - term: それ
    meaning: That
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike これ, それ refers to something close to the listener, or something previously mentioned
      by either the speaker or the listener.
  - term: あれ
    meaning: That (over there)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike これ, あれ refers to something distant from both the speaker and the listener.
  - term: どれ
    meaning: Which (of three or more)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike これ, どれ is an **interrogative pronoun** used to ask about a choice among multiple options.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing これ with similar words, remember that これ always refers to
  a specific *thing* close to the speaker. この needs a noun following it. ここ refers to a *place*. それ refers
  to something near the listener or previously mentioned. あれ refers to something far away, and どれ is used
  for asking 'which one?'
