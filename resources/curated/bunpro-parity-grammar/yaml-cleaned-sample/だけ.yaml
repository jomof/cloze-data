  「だけ」 is similar to "only" or "just" in English. It indicates that something is limited to the item or action it modifies. Think of it as saying "while other possibilities exist, this is the sole one."

  **Key Points:**

  *  「だけ」 attaches directly to nouns, verbs (dictionary form), い-adjectives, and な-adjectives.
  *  For な-adjectives, 「だけ」 typically follows the な-adjective directly. The distinction mentioned in the original input regarding noun vs. adjective form of な-adjectives influencing measurability is a subtle nuance, but functionally, 「だけ」 simply attaches to the な-adjective.
  *  It emphasizes exclusivity or limitation.

  rather than limiting to one thing.
