  又（また）…も combines the adverb 又 (again, also) with the particle も (also). It's used to add information to a previous statement, similar to saying "moreover," "additionally," or "furthermore" in English. The particle も emphasizes that the new information is in addition to the previous point. You'll often see a statement (A) followed by 又, then a noun or phrase plus も (B), indicating that (B) is another piece of information related to (A).

  For even more emphasis, you can use でも or ても instead of も after 又. This highlights the additional point even more strongly.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The information following 又…も is usually new or not immediately obvious from the first statement.
  *  While 又…も can sometimes be translated as "or," this usage is less common than its use for addition.

false_friends:
  - term: しかも
    meaning: Moreover, Furthermore
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 又〜も, しかも often adds information that is surprising or goes a step further than the
      initial statement, often emphasizing a positive or negative aspect to a greater degree. While both
      can introduce additional information, しかも tends to build on the previous point with something more
      impactful or unexpected.
post_false_friends_writeup: Both 又〜も and しかも are used to add information, but しかも often implies a stronger
  degree of emphasis or surprise in the additional information compared to 又〜も, which is generally a more
  straightforward addition.
