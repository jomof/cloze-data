  易い (*yasui*) is an い-adjective that is commonly attached to the ます-stem of verbs. When used this way, it means "easy to do (something)". The "something" is the verb preceding やすい. Sometimes, やすい can also mean "prone to (doing something)" or "likely to (do something)\," especially when the verb describes emotions or states.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  Be careful not to confuse 易い (*yasui*, easy) with 安い (*yasui*, cheap). While both are pronounced the same, they are written with different kanji and have different meanings. When used with verbs to mean "easy to," you should generally write やすい in hiragana.
  *  Although 易い is grammatically an い-adjective, it's rarely used on its own without being attached to a verb. If you want to say something is "easy" in general, it's more natural to use the な-adjective 簡単 (*kantan*).
