  The adverbial particle しか is often compared to だけ, as it also expresses "only". However, unlike だけ, しか can **only** be used with negative verb forms. Therefore, しか～ない is generally translated as "there's only (A)" or "there's nothing but (A)". This grammar point is used with nouns and indicates that nothing apart from that one thing exists.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  The verb following しか must be in its negative form (ない or ありません).

  a negative verb form. Using a positive verb with しか would be grammatically incorrect.
