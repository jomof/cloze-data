  The particle より is used to indicate a point of comparison, similar to "than" in English. It's attached to the noun or verb phrase that is being compared **against**. The focus of the sentence is on the item *not* marked by より, highlighting that it is "more" of something than the item with より.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While often translated as "more than," remember that the element marked by より is actually the **lesser** of the two being compared. The sentence structure emphasizes what surpasses the item with より.
  *  In casual speech, より might appear to stand alone without directly attaching to another word. In these cases, it implies a comparison to a general or previously mentioned context. Think of it as meaning "compared to other things" or "than usual."

post_example_writeup: Remember that while より indicates a comparison, the emphasis is on the item *not*
  marked by it. Understanding this distinction can help avoid confusion, especially when より appears without
  a direct counterpart in casual speech.

      or greater.
  - term: というより
    meaning: '...is more of a... than a..., Rather than saying that...'
    kind: synonym

      of qualities.
  - term: 以上に
    meaning: More than, No less than, Even more

    nuance: 「こそ」 emphasizes a particular noun, often highlighting it as the most important or relevant,
      but it doesn't directly make comparisons in the same way as より.
  - term: 以上 ①
    meaning: More than (or equal to), Over・(and) above, Any more・Greater, Exceeding
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「以上」 signifies being above a certain quantity or standard, similar to 「以上に」, while より focuses
      on comparative qualities.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up より with similar expressions, focus on the specific nuance
  each conveys. より is primarily for basic comparison, highlighting what is being surpassed. Expressions
  like ほど～ない directly state inferiority, while より～のほうが indicates preference. Phrases like 以上 and 異常に emphasize
  exceeding a limit, and こそ is for emphasis. Understanding these subtle differences will improve your
  accuracy.
