writeup: |-
  The grammar point **てみる** expresses the idea of "trying to do something." It combines the **て-form** of a verb with the verb **見る (みる)**, which in this context means "to try." The nuance is often about doing something to see what happens or to experience it for oneself.

  **Key points:**

  *  It's typically used when trying something for the **first time**.
  *  It can also be used to suggest or recommend that someone else tries something (**てみて** or **てみてください**).
  *  In very casual speech, sometimes the **て** is dropped, resulting in **verb stem + み**, which conveys a sense of "just give it a go!"
  *  Be aware that when **てみた** is used in the past tense, it usually implies the attempt was **successful**, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

  **Important Consideration:** While you can write 見る with kanji, using hiragana (みる) is more common and avoids emphasizing the "see" meaning too strongly, which could lead to misunderstanding.

false_friends:
  - term: てごらん
    meaning: (Please) try to, (Please) look
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「てみる」, 「てごらん」 is a command or strong suggestion, often used by superiors to inferiors
      or parents to children. It carries a sense of encouragement or instruction.
  - term: 〜ようと思う・〜おうと思う
    meaning: I think I will, I think I shall, Going to, Gonna (Volitional + と思う)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both express intention, 「〜ようと思う」 focuses more on the decision-making process or a plan
      for the future, whereas 「てみる」 emphasizes the act of trying something out to see what happens.
  - term: ようにする
    meaning: To try to, To make sure to, To endeavor to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ようにする」 indicates an ongoing effort or a regular attempt to do something, focusing on the
      process or habit formation, unlike the one-time trial implied by 「てみる」.
  - term: Verb[volitional]とする
    meaning: Try to, Attempt to, To be about to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「Verb[volitional]とする」 implies a stronger sense of intention and effort, often indicating an
      attempt that might be challenging or not guaranteed to succeed. 「てみる」 is generally lighter and more
      exploratory.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up these expressions, consider the degree of intention and
  the context. 「てみる」 is your go-to for expressing the simple act of trying something new. Use 「てごらん」 for
  giving a direct, often encouraging, command. 「〜ようと思う」 is for stating future plans. 「ようにする」 is about
  ongoing efforts, and 「Verb[volitional]とする」 is for describing a deliberate attempt, often in more formal
  situations.
