etymology: まさか is a combination of まさ, meaning 'precise' or 'exact', and the adverbial particle か. The
  か adds a questioning or uncertain nuance, leading to the meaning of disbelief or surprise.
writeup: The adverb まさか expresses a strong feeling of disbelief or surprise, often about something unexpected
  or undesirable. It conveys a sense of "I never thought that would happen" or "Is it really true?". It's
  crucial to understand that まさか implies a **deviation from the speaker's expectations or assumptions**.
  It often appears at the beginning of a sentence, setting the tone for the surprising statement that
  follows. While まさ comes from the kanji 正 meaning 'precise' or 'actual', まさか functions solely as an adverb
  in modern Japanese.
