writeup: |-
  にする is a structure that combines the に particle (indicating a location or target) with the verb する (to do/to make). It fundamentally means **to decide on** or **to choose** something. The core nuance of にする lies in the speaker's direct control and decision-making regarding the outcome. The noun preceding にする is what's being decided upon or chosen.

  Think of it as actively "making" a decision or "making" something into a certain state. While often translated as "to decide," it's closer in spirit to the English slang "to go with" or "to have (something)." For example, saying 「ビールにする」 is like saying "I'll have a beer" or "I'll go with a beer."

  Sometimes, the particle と is used instead of に (とする). While the basic meaning remains the same, the nuance shifts slightly. とする often emphasizes the resulting state more than the act of deciding. It can also sound a bit more formal or less assertive than にする.

  Consider this analogy to English:

  *  **に (ni):** "I'll buy a burger." (Focus on the direct action of buying.)
  *  **と (to):** "I'll go with a burger." (Softer, less direct focus on the action.)

  While often used for tangible items like food or drinks, にする can also be used with more abstract nouns.

    english: What will you decide on?

    conjugation: polite (non-past)

      you might not know well or someone older.

      it casual and confident. 「～だよ」 is a masculine sentence ending adding a sense of assertion.
  - japanese: もしよかったら、映画の後にうちでお茶にしませんか?

    conjugation: past (plain)

      a sense of hearsay.
  - japanese: このプロジェクトは、予定通りに進めることにします。
    english: We will proceed with this project as planned.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: Here, 「ことにします」 (a related grammar point) is used, which is more formal and indicates a decision
      made by a group or entity. While related, it shows how 「にする」 can be incorporated into other grammatical
      structures.
post_example_writeup: Remember that the nuance between にする and とする is subtle. にする emphasizes the act of
  making a decision, while とする emphasizes the resulting state. In many everyday conversations, they are
  interchangeable, but being aware of this subtle difference can help you understand the underlying meaning
  more deeply.
false_friends:
  - term: に決まっている
    meaning: Surely, Bound to, Certainly, Be decided
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「にする」, 「に決まっている」 expresses certainty or a conclusion that something is definitely the
      case, rather than the act of making a decision.
  - term: ことになる
    meaning: It will end up being, It is the result of, It has been decided that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「にする」, 「ことになる」 indicates a result or outcome, often due to external factors, rather
      than a personal decision.
  - term: ことにする
    meaning: To decide on, Have decided to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to 「にする」, 「ことにする」 often carries a stronger sense of finality or a decision made
      after some consideration. It can also imply a slightly more formal decision-making process.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up these similar expressions, remember that 「にする」 focuses
  on the **act of deciding** or **choosing** something. 「に決まっている」 emphasizes **certainty**, 「ことになる」 highlights
  a **resulting state**, and 「ことにする」 implies a more **deliberate and potentially formal decision**.
