writeup: The grammar point 「次第だ・次第で」 expresses that a certain outcome or condition **depends on** a preceding
  noun. Think of it as saying "(B) is determined by (A)" or "(B) will happen based on (A)". The noun preceding
  「次第」 often indicates a factor, situation, or person that has control over the subsequent event. While
  「次第」 itself can mean "order" or "sequence", in this grammatical context, it carries the nuance of **dependence**
  or **conditionality**. You'll often see it translated as "depending on", "it depends on", or "so".

  Remember that 「に応じて」 suggests a reaction or adaptation, and 「にかかっている」 emphasizes the importance of what
  something depends on. Also, be mindful of the different 「次第」 that means "as soon as."
