writeup: |-
  もの (or 物 in its kanji form) is classified as a 形式名詞 (dummy noun) in Japanese. This means it's a noun used similarly to 'thing' in English. もの commonly refers to things without a specific name or things too complex to easily name. When もの is combined with the auxiliary verb だ, it implies that the previously mentioned (A) is something that "is what it is." This is often used to express customs, conventions, common sense, or to highlight naturally expected outcomes. **Important considerations:**

  *  **General truths and norms:** ものだ expresses widely accepted ideas or behaviors.
  *  **Natural outcomes:** It can describe results that are naturally expected in a given situation.
  *  **Exclamatory nuance:** Sometimes, it carries a sense of realization or emphasis, like "That's just how it is!"
  *  **Negation:** To express that something is unexpected or shouldn't be the case, replace だ with ではない or じゃない.
  *  **Casual form:** もの can be shortened to もん, especially in spoken language, making the statement more casual.
