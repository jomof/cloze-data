  「代わりに」 (kawari ni) is used to express that one thing is being done or used **in place of** another. 「代わり」 (kawari) itself means "substitute" or "replacement." The particle 「に」 indicates the direction or purpose of the substitution. It can often be translated as "instead of," "in place of," or "in exchange for."

  **Important points:**

  *  「代わりに」 can follow nouns or verbs in their dictionary form.
  *  It often appears at the beginning of a sentence to introduce an alternative option, meaning something like "rather than that, (A)" or "instead, (A).".
  *  While 「替わりに」 (kawari ni) with the kanji 替 can also be used, 「代わりに」 is more common and there's generally little difference in nuance in this grammatical structure.

      being discussed or considered.

false_friends:
  - term: むしろ
    meaning: Rather, Instead, Over
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「代わりに」, 「むしろ」 often implies a preference or that something is a better option, rather
      than just a substitute. It carries a stronger sense of "rather than that, this is better".
  - term: に代わって
    meaning: In place of, On behalf of, To succeed
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to 「代わりに」, 「に代わって」 often emphasizes acting on someone's behalf or succeeding
      them in a role or responsibility. It has a stronger connotation of representation or succession.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「むしろ」 and 「に代わって」 share some overlap in meaning with 「代わりに」, it's important
  to consider the nuances. 「むしろ」 suggests a preference, indicating something is the better choice, while
  「代わりに」 simply indicates a replacement. 「に代わって」 often implies acting on someone's behalf or taking over
  a role, adding a layer of representation or succession that 「代わりに」 doesn't usually have. To avoid mixing
  them up, consider if the focus is simply on replacement, a better alternative, or acting on someone's
  behalf.
