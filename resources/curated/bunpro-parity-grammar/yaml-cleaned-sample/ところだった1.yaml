writeup: As explained in the general grammar point for 「ところ」, 「ところ」 is a noun that is often used to highlight
  the situation within which a verb is 'about to' happen (when that verb appears in its dictionary form,
  followed by 「ところだ」). However, when followed by 「だった」 (the past tense of 「だ」), it emphasizes that the
  thing that was 'about to' happen never actually eventuated (or that another more important event happened
  at that moment). This can be translated as "to almost (do something)", or "to be on the verge of (doing
  something)". The verb that 「ところ」 is paired with may also be in the negative form (ない-form). In this
  case, it implies that something was 'about not' to happen (but then did).

    kind: synonym
    nuance: While this grammar point also uses 「ところだった」, it describes an action that was interrupted,
      rather than an action that almost happened but didn't. The nuance lies in whether the action was
      initiated or merely on the verge of starting.
  - term: るところだ
    meaning: About to, On the verge of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ところだった」, 「るところだ」 describes an action that is about to happen imminently. 「ところだった」
      emphasizes that the action *didn't* actually happen.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「ところだった」 focuses on an action that was close
  to happening but ultimately did not. 「るところだ」 describes something that is just about to begin. The second
  meaning of 「ところだった」 focuses on an action that *was* in progress but was interrupted.
