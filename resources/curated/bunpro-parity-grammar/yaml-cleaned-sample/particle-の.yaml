  In Japanese, the particle の often follows other particles to connect two nouns, where the first noun (A) modifies or describes the second noun (B). Think of it as creating a possessive or descriptive link. Noun (B) takes on the qualities or context provided by Noun (A) and the preceding particle.

  Here are some common combinations:

  *  **Noun (A) から の Noun (B)**: Noun (B) that originates **from** Noun (A). This indicates origin or source.
  *  **Noun (A) と の Noun (B)**: Noun (B) that is **with** or related **to** Noun (A). This signifies a relationship or connection.
  *  **Noun (A) へ の Noun (B)**: Noun (B) that is directed **towards** Noun (A). This shows direction or destination.
  *  **Noun (A) で の Noun (B)**: Noun (B) that occurs **in** or **by means of** Noun (A). This indicates location or method.
  *  **Noun (A) まで の Noun (B)**: Noun (B) that extends **until** Noun (A). This denotes a time or spatial limit.

  **Important Considerations:**

  Remember that because Noun (A) is modifying Noun (B), Noun (B) acts as the subject of the phrase. Therefore, particles that typically mark subjects, topics, or direct objects (**に**, **も**, **は**, **が**, **を**) cannot directly precede の in this construction.

      and intimacy. Talking about a 「デート」 suggests a romantic context.

      time for the speaker, and 「空けといてくれる?」 is a casual yet slightly demanding way to ask a favor, suitable
      for flirting.

    english: The reason for the conflict up until now is not widely known.

  - term: の (possession)
    meaning: Possessive particle
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「Particle + の」 which combines particles to connect nouns with a specific relationship,
      the possessive 「の」 directly indicates ownership or belonging (e.g., 私の本 - my book).
  - term: Adjective + の(は)
    meaning: Nominalizer used to emphasize an adjective
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「Particle + の」 which connects nouns, "Adjective + の(は)" turns an adjective into a noun
      phrase, often emphasizing the quality described by the adjective (e.g., 赤いのは私の - the red one is
      mine).
post_false_friends_writeup: It's important not to confuse the 「Particle + の」 structure with the simple
  possessive particle 「の」 or the nominalizing use of 「の」 with adjectives. The key difference lies in the
  presence of another particle before 「の」, which specifies the nature of the relationship between the
  two nouns. Without that preceding particle, 「の」 usually indicates possession or nominalization.
