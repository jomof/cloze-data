  The grammar point **はずがない** expresses a strong sense of improbability or impossibility. It literally means something is "not expected to be the case." It's formed by attaching **はずがない** to the plain form of a verb or adjective, or a noun followed by の. Think of **はず** (from the kanji 筈) as suggesting that something is naturally expected or should be true. Adding **がない** negates this expectation. While often translated as "cannot be," it's more accurate to think of it as expressing that a certain outcome is highly unlikely based on logical reasoning or common sense.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Nuance**: **はずがない** suggests a lower probability than **わけがない**, although both convey improbability. **わけがない** often implies a stronger, more definitive impossibility, whereas **はずがない** leaves a slight possibility, however small.
  *  **Comparison to ないはずだ**: Be careful not to confuse **はずがない** with **ないはずだ**. **ないはずだ** means "it is expected that it is not the case" or "it is bound not to be," expressing a confident assumption. **はずがない**, on the other hand, expresses the speaker's judgment that something is unlikely to be true.

  is about improbability based on expectations. **はずだ** is about expectations. **わけだ** explains a reason.
  **わけがない** is a stronger "no way." Expressions with **ない** generally involve negation, but the nuance
  differs. Practice using them in context to solidify your understanding.
