writeup: |-
  すら is an adverbial particle in Japanese that basically translates as "even." The primary difference between it and も is that すら tends to present far more extreme examples to which a specific rule applies, and therefore also applies to all other less extreme examples. In most cases すら will be used with a negative nuance.

  As すら is an adverbial particle, it will be seen directly after nouns, or nouns followed by case-marking particles. すら may also be followed by も in order to emphasize the point even further.

  Caution: すら and さえ are relatively similar in terms of strength. However, すら is more formal and cannot be used in the さえ～ば construction. すら also tends to be the most extreme example from within a large group, while さえ places more emphasis on a specific individual.

  **Fun Fact**: は, も, さえ, and すら are all adverbial particles that share a linear relationship in regards to the way that they are used. This relationship refers to the intensity of how (A) fits into a group. This can be imagined as follows:

  *  (A) は - (A) is as expected, and there is nothing surprising about it.
  *  (A) も - (A) also fits the category of the main topic (は), but may or may not be surprising.
  *  (A) さえ - (A) also fits the category of the main topic (は), but is quite surprising when examined individually.
  *  (A) すら - (A) also fits the category of the main topic (は), but is the most extreme example possible, thus implying that anything below that level also applies.
