writeup: |-
  When the う-verb 抜く "to extract" is connected to the ます-stem of another verb, it often indicates that the action of that verb has happened **completely**. This nuance of "extracting" implies that something has been **overcome** or **seen through to the bitter end**. You can think of the literal meaning of 抜く as being similar to the English expression "to pull through"; for example, "despite difficulties, I pulled through in the end".

  Alternatively, 抜く can be used when an action is performed to a very **deep** or **substantial degree**. This is closer to the English "thoroughly" or "deeply". This usage is often seen with verbs that don't have a clear endpoint, such as 知る "to know", implying knowing every single little detail.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  On most occasions, ぬく is used when there is some hardship or adversity associated with the action.
  *  Unlike 切る, ぬく is almost always used in relation to human actions. 切る, on the other hand, can be used for both human actions and other events.

false_friends:
  - term: 上がる・上げる
    meaning: Something is finished, To finish something, Something has come to an end, To do something
      completely, To do something through
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 抜く, 上がる/上げる doesn't inherently carry the nuance of overcoming hardship or seeing something
      through to the bitter end. It simply indicates completion.
  - term: 切る
    meaning: To do something completely to the end, Utterly, Resolutely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 切る can also mean doing something completely, it doesn't always imply the same level
      of sustained effort or overcoming adversity as 抜く. 切る is also more widely applicable to non-human
      actions.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 抜く with 上がる/上げる and 切る, remember that 抜く often emphasizes
  the aspect of persevering through difficulty or deeply understanding something. 上がる/上げる simply denote
  completion, while 切る indicates a resolute finish but is more broadly applicable than 抜く.
