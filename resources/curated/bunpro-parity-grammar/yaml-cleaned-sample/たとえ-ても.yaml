writeup: '**たとえ** (tatoe), deriving from the verb **例える** (tatoeru) meaning "to speak figuratively," is
  a Japanese word frequently paired with **ても** (temo) or **でも** (demo) to introduce possibilities or
  suppositions. Typically positioned at the start of a sentence, **たとえ** precedes a potential scenario,
  comparison, or assumption. The core function of **たとえ** is to present situations where, "even if (A)
  were true, (B) might still happen or not happen." This signifies a **contrastive** relationship between
  the clauses. In contrast, **もし** (moshi) is generally used when (A) directly leads to (B), establishing
  a **resultative** relationship.'
