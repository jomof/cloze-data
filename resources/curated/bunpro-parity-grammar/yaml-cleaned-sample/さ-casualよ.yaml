  **さ** is an interjection (**感動詞**) in Japanese with several uses. We'll focus on its function at the end of a sentence, where it's similar to **よ**, emphasizing a statement with a nuance of confidence or assertiveness. Think of it as saying, "I'm pretty sure about this," or sometimes, depending on tone, a more forceful assertion like, "Believe me!" or even a slightly exasperated, "Seriously!" While similar to **よ**, **さ** often carries a stronger feeling of certainty or insistence.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Gender:** While men commonly use this **さ**, it's less frequent for women. Women might use **わよ** instead for a similar effect.
  *  **Intonation:** The meaning and feeling behind **さ** can change significantly depending on the speaker's tone of voice. It can range from a simple confident statement to an angry declaration or even a lighthearted remark.
  *  **Casual Setting:** This grammar point is strictly for casual speech (**タメ語**).

  Essentially, **さ** at the end of a sentence adds a layer of conviction or insistence to what's being said, making it a more emphatic version of **よ** in informal contexts.

  used. The sentence-ending **さ** will always be at the very end of a sentence, unlike the other uses
  of **さ**.
