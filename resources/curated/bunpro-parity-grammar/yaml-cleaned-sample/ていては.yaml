  ていては is a structure often seen with verbs that expresses "if one continues with (A), (B)". In most cases, this indicates a **negative outcome**. ていては is a combination of the て-form of a verb, 居る "to be" in its て-form, and は. The final ては is often considered its own conjunctive structure that may exhibit hypothetical situations or repetitive actions. In this case, it's a mix of both, depending on the verb it's attached to.

  **Important Note:** Apart from the inclusion of ている to the base verb to show continuation, the ては in ていては is the same ては that appears with other set patterns such as てはいけない, てはならない, and てはだめ when expressing something negative.

  - term: ては
    meaning: If, With, Since, Because
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ていては, ては does not necessarily imply a continuing action over time. It can describe
      a single instance or a more general condition.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between ていては and ては, remember that ていては specifically emphasizes
  the **continuation** of an action leading to a consequence, often negative. ては has a broader usage,
  including single instances or general conditional statements.
