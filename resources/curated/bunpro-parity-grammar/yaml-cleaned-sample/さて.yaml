  Acting as a conjunction, **さて** is used when you want to change the topic of conversation or move on to a new point. It's commonly translated as "well" or "well then." **さて** appears at the beginning of a sentence, signaling the introduction of a new topic or action.

  **Fun Fact:** Although **さて** is very rarely written in kanji, you might occasionally see 扨 or 偖. Both of these kanji carry the meaning of "now," indicating the start of something new.
