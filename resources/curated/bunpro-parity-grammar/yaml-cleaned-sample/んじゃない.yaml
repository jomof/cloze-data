writeup: |-
  **んじゃない** is a slightly slang informal grammar pattern used with verbs to prohibit or strongly advise against something. It translates to "don't do (A)" or "you mustn't (A)". The speaker is often in a higher position or feels strongly about the action.

  It's a combination of the case-marking particle **の** (often shortened to ん) and the informal negative copula **じゃない**, which is an abbreviation of **ではない**. It directly connects to the dictionary form of verbs.

  A slightly more formal version, **んじゃありません**, exists but is less common. This version can be used when the speaker wants to forbid something without sounding angry, like an adult speaking to a child.

  The literal translation of Verb + んじゃない could be interpreted as "it's not (verb)", conveying a sense of disapproval or prohibition.

  The **ている** form is often abbreviated to **てる** or **てん** before じゃない, like in 「話してんじゃない」 or 「話してんじゃない」.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  When used in the past tense as **んじゃなかった**, it indicates that something "should not have been done" and carries a nuance of regret or disappointment.
  *  When **んじゃない** comes at the end of a sentence, pay attention to intonation. A rising intonation indicates a question (an abbreviation of んじゃないか), while a falling intonation signals an order or prohibition. The context usually makes the distinction clear.

    english: Don't say something like that to your parents!
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「親におうかって」 implies a direct address to parents, and 「言うんじゃない」 is a strong prohibition typically
      used by someone in a position of authority, like an older sibling or parent. The masculine tone
      comes from the directness of the command.
