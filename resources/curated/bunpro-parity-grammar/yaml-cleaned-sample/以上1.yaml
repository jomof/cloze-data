  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
writeup: To indicate that an amount is equal to or greater than a certain number (A), you can use 以上.
  This term combines the kanji 以, meaning "by means of," and 上, meaning "above." It can be translated
  as "greater than (A)" or "exceeding (A)". Attach 以上 directly to the quantity that represents the minimum.
  Beyond its quantitative usage, 以上 is also commonly used to signify the end of a statement or list, similar
  to saying "that's it" or "the end." While "the end" might sound abrupt in English, it's a perfectly
  natural way to conclude in Japanese, literally meaning "the above (mentioned items) are all."
