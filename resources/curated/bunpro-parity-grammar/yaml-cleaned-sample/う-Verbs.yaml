  う-Verbs include all of the verbs in Japanese that end in う sounds (including some of the verbs that end in る). These verbs are called Godan (五段) "five-level" verbs in Japanese, due to their conjugations using all 5 of the different sounds in the same column (段) that their base form comes from.

  As we can see here, the 「く」 in 「聞く」 changes to 「き」 when conjugated to the polite form 「聞きます」. All of the other sounds in the K-column will be used with 「聞く」, depending on the conjugation. This is the same for all of the う-Verbs.

  「聞（か）ない」, 「聞（き）たい」, 「聞（く）」, 「聞（け）る」, 「聞（こ）う」

  Here we can see the う-Verb 「聞く」 using all of the different K-column sounds in various conjugations.

  **Caution:** Just like with る-Verbs, the base form of the verb may be called "plain form", "casual form", or "short form", depending on the source/book.

post_example_writeup: This grammar point focuses on the dictionary form of う-verbs, also known as Godan
  verbs. Understanding the dictionary form is crucial as it's the base for many other conjugations. The
  examples demonstrate the dictionary form and several common conjugations like the polite form (～ます),
  negative form (～ない, ～ません), past form (～た, ～ました), te-form (～て), conditional forms (～ば, ～たら), volitional
  forms (～う, ～ましょう), imperative form (～ろ, ～てください), potential form (～える), passive form (～られる), and causative
  form (～せる).
false_friends:
  - term: る-Verb (Dictionary)
    meaning: る + ます (Ichidan Verbs)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike う-verbs, る-verbs have a different conjugation pattern. For example, 「食べる」 (taberu -
      to eat) becomes 「食べます」, 「食べない」, 「食べた」, etc.
  - term: る-Verb (Negative)
    meaning: Will/Does/Do (not)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: This refers to the negative form of る-verbs (e.g., 「食べない」), which looks similar to the negative
      plain form of う-verbs but has a different conjugation process.
  - term: う-Verb (Past)
    meaning: う - Verbs (Past tense)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: This refers to the past tense conjugation of う-verbs (e.g., 「聞いた」), which builds upon the
      dictionary form but signifies a completed action.
  - term: Verb + て
    meaning: And, Then (Linking events)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: The te-form of verbs (e.g., 「聞いて」) is used to link actions or describe a sequence of events,
      and while derived from the verb, it serves a different grammatical function than the dictionary
      form itself.
post_false_friends_writeup: It's important to distinguish the dictionary form of う-verbs from other verb
  forms and the conjugation patterns of る-verbs. While the dictionary form is the base, understanding
  its unique conjugation rules will help you avoid confusion with similar-looking forms like the negative
  or past tense. Pay close attention to the different ways う-verbs and る-verbs change when conjugating.
