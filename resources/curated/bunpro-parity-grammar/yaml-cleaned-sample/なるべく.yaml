  Combining 成る (to become), and 可く (to be permissible), なるべく is an expression that literally means "as each opportunity becomes permissible/presents itself." This is often simply translated as "as much as possible" or "whenever possible." なるべく (usually written in hiragana) is regularly used before an entire phrase to express that (A) should happen as much as possible.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Due to なるべく expressing the "possibility" or "having the opportunity" to do something, it will sound considerably softer and more polite than **できるだけ**.
  *  **できるだけ** is a similar expression which more directly states that something will be done "to the full extent possible."

post_example_writeup: While both なるべく and できるだけ express doing something to the best of one's ability,
  なるべく carries a nuance of considering feasibility and opportunity, making it sound less forceful than
  できるだけ. Consider the context and the level of assertiveness you wish to convey when choosing between
  the two.
false_friends:
  - term: できれば・できたら
    meaning: If possible
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike なるべく, できれば/できたら focuses solely on possibility as a condition, without the nuance of
      trying one's best within those possibilities.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing なるべく with できれば or できたら, remember that なるべく emphasizes the
  effort to do something as much as circumstances allow, whereas できれば/できたら simply states a preference
  or condition without implying the same degree of effort.
