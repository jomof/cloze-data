writeup: The grammar pattern ～たまでだ expresses that an action was performed simply or merely, without any
  significant additional intent or consequence. It conveys a sense of modesty or downplaying the significance
  of the action. It's often used to politely deflect praise or to explain a situation with minimal emphasis
  on the actor's role. A close variation is ～たまでのことだ, which carries a similar meaning and can often be
  used interchangeably, though it might slightly emphasize the nature of the event itself rather than
  the action. It's **important** to remember that this structure is used only to describe one's own actions
  or the actions of a group to which the speaker belongs. Using it for others can sound condescending
  or unnatural.

  - term: ～るまでだ
    meaning: Just, Merely, Simply, Only
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both ～たまでだ and ～るまでだ can translate to 'just' or 'merely', ～るまでだ focuses on the idea
      that the action is the only option or resolution, whereas ～たまでだ emphasizes the simplicity or lack
      of significance of a completed action.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing ～たまでだ with ～るまでだ, remember that ～たまでだ describes something
  that *has been done* and emphasizes its simplicity. ～るまでだ, on the other hand, often suggests a future
  action as the only remaining option or a present action as the only extent of something.
