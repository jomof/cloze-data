writeup: The grammar point ほど～ない uses the noun ほど, meaning "extent," followed by a negative verb or adjective.
  It expresses that something is **not to the extent of** the preceding noun or verb. It often translates
  to "not as... as" in English and is used for comparisons. The part before ほど sets a **limit or example**,
  and the part after indicates that the subject does not reach that limit. While frequently used for direct
  comparisons, it can also express that something is less significant or intense than expected.

false_friends:
  - term: より～のほうが
    meaning: To be more ~ than ~
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ほど～ない, より～のほうが directly states that one thing is more than another, rather than implying
      it through negation.
  - term: より
    meaning: More than, Over
    kind: synonym

      reaching a certain extent'.
  - term: ほど
    meaning: The more, About, To the extent that, So much… that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While ほど is part of ほど～ない, when used alone it expresses different meanings, such as degree
      or approximation, not a comparison of inequality.
  - term: まで
    meaning: Even, To even, To the extent of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ほど～ない, まで indicates reaching a certain point or extent, often implying surprise or
      emphasis, not a comparison of inequality.
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions might seem similar because they deal with comparisons
  or degrees, it's important to remember that ほど～ない specifically indicates that something does *not* reach
  a certain level. より directly states that something *is* more than something else. ほど by itself has different
  functions. まで emphasizes reaching a point, not the lack of reaching it. Pay attention to the context
  to choose the most appropriate expression.
