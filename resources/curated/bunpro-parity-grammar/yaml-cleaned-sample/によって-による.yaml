  **によって**, **による**, and **により** are variations of the same grammar point, essentially meaning "according to (A)" or "depending on (A)". This grammar point uses the verb **よる** (to depend on), similar to what you see in the grammar pattern **によると**.

  Here's a breakdown of their typical usage:

  *  **によって**: Often used before a comma, acting as a separator between the cause/condition (A) and the result (B). It's formed by the particle **に** and the て-form of **よる**.
  *  **による**: Commonly found at the end of a sentence, emphasizing that the preceding statement is contingent upon (A). It can also precede a noun, functioning as a modifier indicating that the noun resulted from (A).
  *  **により**: Almost always placed before a comma, separating the condition (A) and the outcome (B). It uses the conjunctive form of **よる**.

  To use these forms, attach them to a noun representing the factor something depends on or is caused by.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While **よる** is usually written in hiragana, it has several kanji forms with similar meanings. You can learn more about this in the explanation for **によると**.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **によって/による** have a wider range of meanings
  than **ために** or **によると**. While they can all express cause or source in some contexts, **によって/による**
  can also mean "by means of" or "depending on." **次第** is distinct as it refers to timing. When using
  the pattern "〜かは〜によって違う", focus on the nuance of something changing based on a factor, which is a specific
  application of **によって**.
