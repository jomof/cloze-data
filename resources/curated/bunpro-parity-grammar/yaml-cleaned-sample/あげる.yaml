etymology: The verb 「あげる」 originally meant "to raise" or "to lift". The sense of "giving" developed from
  the idea of offering something upwards or outwards to another person.
writeup: |-
  「あげる」 is a verb that primarily means **"to give"** something to someone else. Think of it as offering or presenting something. The giver is the subject of the sentence and is usually marked with は or が. The recipient of the gift is marked with the particle に. The object being given is marked with を.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The order of the giver, recipient, and object can be flexible, as long as the correct particles are used.
  *  While 「あげる」 is generally considered polite, it's important to note that it's the most natural and common way to say "to give" in Japanese.
  *  Do **not** use 「あげる」 when giving something to someone of higher status (like your boss or teacher). In those situations, use more honorific language.
  *  The casual equivalent of 「あげる」 is 「やる」. However, 「やる」 can sound a bit rough or even condescending, especially when used towards people. Therefore, 「あげる」 is generally the safer and more polite choice in most situations.

    nuance: 「特別に（とくべつに）」 emphasizes that the action is special. 「あーん」 is the sound for opening your mouth
      to be fed, making the situation playful and flirty.
    etymology: 「チョコレート」 is a loanword from English. 「はい」 is used here to encourage the listener.
post_example_writeup: Remember that the particle に marks the recipient of the action of giving. While
  the basic meaning of 「あげる」 is 'to give', the nuance can change slightly depending on the context and
  the relationship between the speaker and listener.
false_friends:
  - term: もらう
    meaning: To receive, to get, to obtain
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「あげる」, 「もらう」 focuses on the **receiving** end of the action. The subject of the sentence
      is the one receiving, and the giver is marked with から or に.
  - term: てあげる
    meaning: To do something for someone, as a favor for
    kind: grammatical form
    nuance: Unlike 「あげる」, 「てあげる」 describes doing an action **for someone's benefit**, not just the act
      of giving a physical object.
  - term: くれる
    meaning: To give (me), to be given
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「あげる」, 「くれる」 is used when someone gives something **to the speaker** (or someone close
      to the speaker). The giver is the subject, marked with は or が, and the receiver (speaker or someone
      close) is marked with に.
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse 「あげる」 with 「もらう」 and 「くれる」. Focus on who is performing
  the action and who is receiving it. 「あげる」 is about you giving, 「もらう」 is about you receiving, and 「くれる」
  is about someone giving to you. 「てあげる」 is a separate grammatical structure indicating a favor done for
  someone.
