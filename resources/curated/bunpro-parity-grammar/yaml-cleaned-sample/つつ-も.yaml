writeup: |-
  In addition to the base meaning of つつ "while doing (A)" when used by itself, the addition of も simply adds the nuance of "even". This is often translated as "even while doing (A), (B)", or "although doing (A), (B)". (B) will almost always be something that is somehow contradictory to (A).

  Like つつ, つつも will appear after the ます-stem of a verb that describes the original ongoing action.

  **Caution**: Like つつ, つつも will usually include a non-physical action in (A), such as reading, listening, looking, thinking, etc. (B) may be either physical or non-physical.

  Also, in the same way as つつ is similar to ながら, つつも is similar to ながらも.

  Despite the similarities, it will be **important** to remember that つつ only appears with verbs, while ながら can be used after almost any type of word.

  - term: ものの
    meaning: Although, But, Even Though
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike つつも, ものの can attach to verbs in the past tense (た-form), い-adjectives, and nouns with
      の.
  - term: くせに
    meaning: Even though, And yet, Despite
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike つつも, くせに often carries a nuance of blame or resentment and is typically used when the
      speaker feels that the other person's actions are unreasonable or unfair. It can attach to verbs
      in dictionary form or ta-form, い-adjectives, and nouns with の.
  - term: ながらも
    meaning: But, Even while, Even though, Despite, Although
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to つつも, ながらも can also attach to nouns and na-adjectives with である, whereas つつも
      is strictly for verbs.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up つつも with these similar expressions, remember that つつも is
  exclusively used with the ます-stem of verbs and often describes a situation where someone knows something
  but acts contrary to that knowledge. ものの is more versatile in the types of words it can connect, and
  くせに often carries a negative emotional connotation. ながらも is also versatile but doesn't necessarily imply
  a negative feeling like くせに.
