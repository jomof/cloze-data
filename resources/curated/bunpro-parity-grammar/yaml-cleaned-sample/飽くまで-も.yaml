  **飽くまで (akumade)** is an adverb that means "just," "only," "merely," or "strictly." The word 飽く (**aku**) is an older form of the verb 飽きる (**akiru**), which means "to tire of" or "to get sick of." When combined with the particle まで (**made**), meaning "until," 飽くまで (**akumade**) implies continuing something to the point of getting tired of it, which gives it the nuance of something being limited or not deviating from a certain state.

  It often appears at the beginning of a phrase and functions adverbially. The particle も (**mo**), meaning "even," can be added for emphasis as 飽くまでも (**akumademo**), but it's optional.

  飽くまで is often used in polite sentences when expressing a personal opinion. In such cases, it conveys the nuance of "this is merely my opinion," acknowledging that there may be other viewpoints. This way of softening statements is often used with conjunctions like けど (**kedo**) or が (**ga**) before offering a suggestion or thought.
