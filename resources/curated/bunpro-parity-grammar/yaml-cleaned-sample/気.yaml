  When used after verbs, **気** often indicates either the will or desire to do that particular action. This use of **気** is often interpreted as "to feel like doing (A)" in English. More literally, **気** may be translated as "mind", as is similar to the way phrases like "to have half a mind to (A)" in English, indicating that something is either positively or negatively drawing the speaker's attention toward doing (or avoiding) the action of (A).

  As **気** itself is a noun expressing the "mind" or "intention" to do (A), it may be followed by a variety of different verbs indicating an array of slightly unique nuances. Common patterns are **気がある** "to have the feeling of (A)", **気がない** "to not have the feeling of (A)", **気がする** "to feel like (A)", **気がしない** "to not feel like (A)", **気が出る** "for the feeling of (A) to come about", and **気が出ない** "for the feeling of (A) to not come about".

  - term: ような気がする
    meaning: Have a feeling that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both **気** and **ような気がする** express a feeling, **ような気がする** often conveys a more vague
      or intuitive feeling, whereas **気** can sometimes imply a stronger sense of will or motivation,
      especially in phrases like やる気.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up **気** and **ような気がする**, consider the nuance you want to
  convey. If you want to express a general feeling or intuition, **ような気がする** is often appropriate. If
  you're talking about motivation, desire, or a stronger sense of something being true, **気** is more
  suitable. For example, saying 「今日は雨が降る気だ」 sounds a bit strange; 「今日は雨が降るような気がする」 is more natural because
  it expresses an intuitive feeling about the weather.
