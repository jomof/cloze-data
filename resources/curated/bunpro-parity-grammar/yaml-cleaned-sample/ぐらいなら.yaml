writeup: |-
  The grammar point **ぐらいなら** expresses a preference for one option over another. It conveys the idea that the first option is so undesirable that the speaker would choose the second option instead. It's often translated as "would rather (B) than (A)" or "better off (B) than (A)." **ぐらいなら** directly follows a verb in its dictionary form. The second part of the sentence typically presents a more desirable alternative, often using expressions like **ほうがいい** ("it's better to"), **ほうがましだ** ("it's less bad"), or **なさい** (a command, often suggesting a preferable action).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While **ぐらいなら** always follows a dictionary form verb, the context can sometimes imply that the undesirable action (A) has already occurred. In these cases, the nuance shifts to expressing regret and what the speaker *would* have done differently. The translation then becomes closer to "if I had known that (A), then I would have (B)."
