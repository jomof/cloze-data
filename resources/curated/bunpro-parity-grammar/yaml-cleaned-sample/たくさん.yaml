writeup: In Japanese, nouns can often function adverbially, particularly when describing quantity. **たくさん**,
  or 沢山 (often written with kanji), is one such word. It signifies "a lot" or "many." You can use **たくさん**
  before a verb or adjective phrase. When modifying a noun directly, you can use **たくさんの + noun**. While
  it's grammatically correct to place **たくさん** directly before a noun without の, doing so emphasizes the
  entire phrase rather than solely the noun. Using **の** brings more focus to the noun itself. For example,
  「あの店の前にたくさん人が集まっている」 focuses on the gathering at the store, while 「あの店の前に沢山の人が集まっている」 emphasizes the
  sheer number of people.
