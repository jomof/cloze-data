  だらけ is a suffix that is used in Japanese to express when one thing is "covered in" or "filled with" another thing. だらけ is attached to the end of nouns and can optionally be followed by the case-marking particle の and another noun. The second noun is often omitted if the thing that is "covered in" something is obvious from the context.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  だらけ is typically used to describe things that exist in a **scattered** or **undesirable** state (like stars in the sky, or litter on the ground). Therefore, it might sound unnatural when describing something covered in a uniform layer of something else.
  *  While often negative, it can be used neutrally or even positively when the scattered nature is the key aspect (like a sky full of stars).
  *  Be mindful of the nuance. Using だらけ for something intended to be fully covered might sound like it's messy or incomplete.
examples:
  - japanese: パンケーキの裏側が穴だらけで気持ち悪い。

      unintentionally messy application of paint, hence the feeling of unnaturalness, despite being understandable.

      and casual.

post_example_writeup: As noted in the writeup, using だらけ implies a scattered or undesirable quality. While
  the example of painting a wall "ペンキだらけ" is understandable, a more natural phrasing for wanting a wall
  fully painted would be something like 「壁一面にペンキを塗ってください」(Please paint the entire wall) or 「壁をペンキで塗りつぶしてください」(Please
  paint over the wall with paint).
false_friends:
  - term: にほかならない
    meaning: Nothing but, None other than, Simply
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike だらけ which describes something being covered in something else, にほかならない emphasizes that
      something is precisely what it is stated to be.
  - term: しか～ない
    meaning: There's only, Nothing but
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While しか～ない indicates a limitation or restriction, だらけ describes a state of being filled with
      something, often in a scattered way.
  - term: 塗れ
    meaning: Stained, Covered in, Smeared, Dirty with, Soaked in
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 塗れ (まみれ) also means 'covered in', but it often implies a more direct and sometimes unpleasant
      coating, whereas だらけ has a nuance of being filled with many instances of something.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up だらけ with these similar expressions, remember that だらけ emphasizes
  the abundance and often scattered nature of something covering something else. にほかならない is for identification,
  しか～ない is for limitation, and 塗れ often implies a more direct and potentially messy coating.
