writeup: |-
  The auxiliary verbs **せる** and **させる** are used to express that someone was "made to do" or "let do" something. This meaning is called **使役** (causative) in Japanese.

  It's important to understand that **せる** and **させる** are auxiliary verbs with their own meaning, similar to **たい**, **ない**, **だ**, **です**, etc.

  **Conjugation Rules:**

  *  **る-Verbs:** Remove the **る** and add **させる**. (Example: 食べる → 食べさせる)
  *  **う-Verbs:** Change the last kana to the あ-sound kana in the same column (except for う, which becomes わ) and add **せる**. (Examples: 書く → 書かせる, 読む → 読ませる, 会う → 会わせる)
  *  **Special Cases:**
  *  する becomes させる.
  *  来る becomes 来させる.

  **Marking the Doer:**

  With the causative form, the person performing the action is marked with either **に** or **を**. The choice of particle affects the nuance:

  *  **に**: Usually implies that someone was **let** do something.
  *  **を**: Implies that someone was **made** to do something.

  **Literal Meaning:**

  The literal translation of sentences using **せる** and **させる** can highlight the roles of the particles **に** (location) and **を** (target):

  *  **(A) が (B) に 楽しませる**: For (A) to cause fun **in** (B).
  *  **(A) が (B) を 楽しませる**: For (A) to cause fun **through** (B).

  - term: Verb［れる・られる］
    meaning: 'Passive voice: to be done by someone; or, potential form: can do'
    kind: grammatical form
    nuance: Unlike Verb［せる・させる］ which indicates causing an action, Verb［れる・られる］ indicates either receiving
      an action (passive) or the ability to perform an action (potential).
  - term: Causative-Passive (Verb ＋ させられる / される)
    meaning: To be made to do something against one's will
    kind: grammatical form
    nuance: While both express being made to do something, Causative-Passive emphasizes that the action
      is forced and against the subject's will, which is a nuance not always present in the basic causative
      form Verb［せる・させる］.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that the basic causative form (せる/させる) focuses
  on the act of making or letting someone do something. The passive form (れる/られる) focuses on receiving
  an action. The causative-passive form (させられる/される) specifically highlights the feeling of being forced
  to do something.
