writeup: |-
  **恐らく (osoraku)** is an adverb that originally comes from the conjugation of the classical Japanese verb **恐る (osoru)**, meaning "to fear". In most modern contexts, **恐らく** serves as a formal way to express "probably" or "perhaps". It's frequently used with other expressions of conjecture, such as **だろう (darou)** or **かもしれない (kamoshirenai)**.

  As an adverb, **恐らく** typically appears at the beginning of a sentence, preceding the statement of conjecture. While **恐らく** can convey the sense of "I fear that (A)", it's not limited to negative situations. In this usage, the nuance of "I fear that (A)" reflects the speaker's modesty, acknowledging that their assumption might be correct based on the available information.

  **Important Consideration:** While rooted in a verb meaning "to fear", the primary function of **恐らく** in modern Japanese is to express probability in a formal manner.

  **Fun fact:** The verb **恐る** was a *yodan dou shi* (四段動詞) in classical Japanese, a verb conjugation type largely replaced by *godan dou shi* (五段動詞 or う-verbs) in modern Japanese.

  to some other expressions.

  - term: かもしれない
    meaning: Might, Maybe, Probably
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **おそらく**, **かもしれない** is less formal and implies a slightly higher degree of uncertainty.
      It can be used in a wider range of situations.
  - term: もしかしたら
    meaning: Perhaps, Maybe, Possibly
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Compared to **おそらく**, **もしかしたら** expresses a more tentative possibility and is generally considered
      less formal. It often suggests a lower probability than **おそらく**.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing **おそらく** with **かもしれない** and **もしかしたら**, remember that
  **おそらく** carries a formal nuance. While all three express uncertainty, **おそらく** is often used in more
  formal settings or when presenting a more considered opinion. **かもしれない** is a general expression of
  possibility, and **もしかしたら** indicates a weaker possibility.
