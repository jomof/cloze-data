writeup: かのようだ is a set phrase in Japanese indicating that something "appears to be (A)", but the speaker
  is not certain. It translates to "as if (A)" or "just like (A)". This is a combination of the adverbial
  particle か, the possessive particle の, and the auxiliary verb 様だ meaning "appearing to be". The literal
  nuance is akin to asking "isn't it like (A)?", highlighting the speaker's uncertainty. かのようだ can follow
  verbs and い-Adjectives directly. For な-Adjectives and nouns, である is required before かのようだ. When 様だ modifies
  a noun or verb later in the sentence, ように or ような are used. This grammatical structure often appears
  with expressions like まるで (entirely, just as if), which intensifies the speaker's assumption, similar
  to the difference between "it's as if (A)" and "it's just as if (A)" in English.
