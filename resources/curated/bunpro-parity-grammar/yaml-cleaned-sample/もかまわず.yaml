writeup: も構わず is an expression that combines も, the u-Verb 構う "to mind", or "to care", and the literary
  auxiliary verb ず, which connects to verbs in the same way and has the same meaning as ない. Common translations
  for this pattern include "without worrying about (A), (B)" and "without minding (A), (B)". This structure
  is seen with verbs, い-Adjectives, and な-Adjectives followed by の, but may also follow nouns without
  the addition of の. Occasionally, にも may be used instead of も for further emphasis. も構わず is used most
  frequently to express that (A) is something that is either being ignored or that the speaker is not
  worried about. The (B) part of the statement will regularly highlight something that is being done without
  any consideration for (A). This comes from the standard "to brace" or "to give pause" meaning of 構う.
