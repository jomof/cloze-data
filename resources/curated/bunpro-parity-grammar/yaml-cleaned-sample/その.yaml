writeup: 「その」 is a **pre-noun adjectival** (連体詞 - *rentaishi*). This means it always comes before a noun
  to modify it. Unlike adjectives, pre-noun adjectivals do not conjugate, so 「その」 always stays the same.
  It indicates something close to the listener but away from the speaker. Think of it as pointing to something
  within the listener's immediate vicinity.

      agreement from the listener.
  - japanese: すみません、そのペンを取ってください。
