  **たった** is a common adverb in Japanese that originates from an emphasized alteration of 唯 "only", "merely". **たった** keeps the same meaning of **ただ** in that it expresses that something is "only (A)", "just (A)", or "no more than (A)". This nuance is usually used when the actual number of (A) is exceptionally low compared to the speaker's expectation or anticipation.

  **たった** will often appear at the beginning of sentences and can modify the whole sentence or a specific number when followed by **の** and then that number.

  As **たった** is an adverb that is usually used for emphasis, it often accompanies other similar grammar patterns like **だけ**, **しか**, etc.

  **Fun Fact**: The common expression **ただいま** "now", or "I'm home" may occasionally be seen in the emphasized form **たったいま**. This is primarily when the meaning is "now", or "just now" (right at this present moment), rather than "I'm home".

  - term: 僅かに
    meaning: Only, Slightly, A little, Barely, Merely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **たった(の)** which often emphasizes a surprisingly small quantity, **僅かに** can also express
      a small degree or margin, not just quantity.
post_false_friends_writeup: Both **たった(の)** and **僅かに** can mean 'only', but **たった(の)** typically highlights
  a surprisingly or unexpectedly small number. **僅かに** can refer to a small amount or degree in a broader
  sense. For example, you might use **僅かに** to say something is 'slightly different', but **たった(の)** wouldn't
  fit there.
