  とうとう is an adverb that expresses that something **finally** happens. In Japanese, there are several ways to convey this, but とうとう is a common one. It comes from the kanji 到頭, literally meaning 到 (to arrive at) and 頭 (the head/crux of something). This origin gives it the nuance of something concluding after a period of time or effort. Therefore, "finally" and "after all" are the two main English translations. Like many Japanese adverbs, とうとう often appears at the beginning of a sentence or phrase.

  While とうとう is frequently written in hiragana, understanding the kanji helps grasp its inherent meaning: something has **ended**, usually after a long process or significant effort. This adverb can describe both positive and negative outcomes, as its focus is on the time taken to achieve the result, not whether the result is desirable.

  **Important Consideration:**

  Avoid using とうとう when discussing something expected to happen or begin naturally, without any preceding effort. For instance, while you might feel like saying "Finally, it's summer!", this isn't something anyone worked towards; it occurs naturally. In such cases, いよいよ is more appropriate, carrying the nuance of "finally" or "at last" specifically related to something starting or happening.

false_friends:
  - term: いよいよ
    meaning: At last, Finally, More and more
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike とうとう, いよいよ emphasizes anticipation or the growing sense that something is about to
      happen or begin. It often relates to events that occur naturally or are expected.
  - term: 遂に
    meaning: Finally, At last
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to とうとう, 遂に (ついに) indicates that something has finally happened after some time or
      effort. However, 遂に often carries a stronger sense of triumph or accomplishment, especially after
      overcoming difficulties.
post_false_friends_writeup: While とうとう, いよいよ, and 遂に can all be translated as "finally", it's important
  to understand their nuances to use them correctly. とうとう emphasizes the conclusion of something after
  a period of time, without necessarily highlighting difficulty or anticipation. いよいよ focuses on the anticipation
  and imminence of an event, often one that occurs naturally. 遂に, on the other hand, often suggests a
  final resolution after challenges or a long wait.
