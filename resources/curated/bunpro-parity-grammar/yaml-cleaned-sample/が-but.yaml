etymology: The particle が originally served as a subject marker in classical Japanese. Its current function
  as a conjunction expressing contrast evolved over time, stemming from its role in highlighting a preceding
  statement before introducing a potentially contrasting or additional point.
writeup: |-
  The particle が serves as a conjunction, similar to "but" or "however" in English. Its core function is to **highlight the first part of the sentence while introducing a contrast or additional information in the second part.** It's a fundamental way to connect clauses, showing a relationship where the second part might qualify or add to the first.

  *  が is placed directly after the clause it modifies.
  *  It can connect clauses with verbs, い-adjectives, or nouns and な-adjectives (which require a form of だ or です before が).
  *  While similar to other conjunctions meaning "but," が often carries a slightly more **formal and direct nuance**.

  **Important Consideration:** Sometimes a sentence ends with が. In this case, the speaker implies that there is more to say but leaves it unsaid, often because it's obvious or implied by the context.

post_example_writeup: Pay attention to the nuance that が provides. It acknowledges the first part of the
  sentence before introducing the second part, which often presents a contrast, reservation, or additional
  thought. The formality of が is generally higher compared to けど.
