  When the adverb 陸に (roku ni) appears in negative sentences (～ない), it indicates that something is not done **satisfactorily**, **enough**, or **properly**. This grammar pattern typically appears at the beginning of a clause. The latter part of the sentence will include a negative form (ない), often with a verb in its potential form. While 「ろくに」 is often written in kanji, it is also very common to see it in hiragana. The variation 「碌に」 is also possible, but the kanji 「碌」 is *ateji* (kanji used for their phonetic value rather than their meaning). This grammar point often carries the nuance of insufficient effort or something being half-baked.

  **Fun Fact:** The kanji 陸 (riku), meaning 'land', is used here with the reading 'roku' to convey the nuance of flatness, correctness, or seriousness.

  - term: めったに〜ない
    meaning: Hardly, Rarely, Seldom
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both 「陸に～ない」 and 「めったに～ない」 indicate something doesn't happen often or well, 「陸に～ない」
      emphasizes the *quality* or *sufficiency* of the action, whereas 「めったに～ない」 focuses on the *frequency*
      or rarity of the action.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「陸に～ない」 and 「めったに～ない」, remember that 「陸に～ない」 focuses on
  the *how* or *how well* something is done, while 「めったに～ない」 focuses on *how often* something is done.
  For example, you might say 「ろくに寝られなかった」 (I couldn't sleep well) or 「めったに寝坊しない」 (I rarely oversleep).
