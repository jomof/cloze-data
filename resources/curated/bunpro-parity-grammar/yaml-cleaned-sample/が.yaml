  **が** is a fundamental particle in Japanese, primarily functioning as a **subject marker**. This means it identifies the person or thing performing an action. Think of it as highlighting **who or what** is doing something or possessing a certain quality. It also serves as an **identification particle**, singling out a specific entity or characteristic, often in response to a question or when introducing new information.

  A key distinction is the nuance compared to **は**. While both can mark topics, **が** emphasizes the element preceding it, drawing attention to the subject itself. Conversely, **は** emphasizes the information following it. **が** often indicates something happening or existing as a distinct event or attribute, separate from other possibilities.

  For example, 「カレーが辛い」 (Kare-ga karai) focuses on the curry *being* spicy, as opposed to something else. It answers an implicit question of "What is spicy?".

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **New Information:** が is frequently used when introducing new information or answering a question.
  *  **Description of Specific Instances:** It's suitable for describing a particular instance or state of something.
  *  **Contrast:** が can highlight a contrast or distinction between items.
  *  **Not Typically for Self (General Statements):** Generally, when making general statements about yourself, は is more common. However, が can be used for self-reference when comparing yourself to others.

false_friends:
  - term: は
    meaning: As for... (Highlights sentence topic)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike が, は marks the topic of the sentence, indicating what the sentence is *about*, whereas
      が identifies the subject performing the action or possessing a quality.
  - term: を
    meaning: Object marking particle
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike が which marks the subject, を marks the direct object of a transitive verb (the thing
      being acted upon).
post_false_friends_writeup: It's crucial to distinguish between が, は, and を. While they are all particles,
  they serve different grammatical functions. Think of が as answering "who or what is doing something?",
  は as indicating "what are we talking about?", and を as showing "what is being acted upon?". Understanding
  these distinctions is fundamental to constructing grammatically correct and natural-sounding Japanese
  sentences.
