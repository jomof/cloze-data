etymology: みたい is derived from the more formal phrase 「を見たような (o mita yō na)」, literally meaning "like
  having seen it". This origin highlights its function in expressing resemblance based on direct or seemingly
  direct information.
writeup: |-
  The な-adjective **みたい** is used to express that something is "like" or "similar to" something else. It conveys a sense of resemblance based on what the speaker perceives, often through visual information or direct observation. It's a versatile grammar point that can follow nouns, verbs in their dictionary form, い-adjectives, and other grammatical elements that typically precede な-adjectives.

  **Key Points:**

  *  When **みたい** is at the end of a sentence, it's often followed by **だ** or **です**, although this is frequently omitted in casual speech.
  *  When modifying a noun, **みたい** becomes **みたいな**.
  *  **みたい** is generally used in conversational settings and is less formal than **ようだ**.
  *  It's important not to confuse **みたい** with the verb **見たい (mitai)**, which means "want to see."

  - term: にみえる
    meaning: To look, To seem, To appear
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「みたい」, 「に見える」 often emphasizes a visual impression and can also describe something
      that appears a certain way despite the reality.
  - term: ようだ
    meaning: It seems that, It appears that, It looks like
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ようだ」 is more formal and can be based on less direct information or reasoning, whereas 「みたい」
      is typically based on direct observation.
  - term: そう
    meaning: Look like, Appear, Seem, Have a feeling that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: When using 「そう」 to mean 'it seems like', it often expresses a more subjective feeling or inference
      based on the situation, while 「みたい」 relies more on tangible evidence.
  - term: みたいに・みたいな
    meaning: Like, Similar to, Resembling
    kind: synonym
    nuance: These forms function similarly to 「みたい」 but are used adverbially (みたいに) or to directly modify
      nouns (みたいな).
  - term: そうに・そうな
    meaning: Seem, Look like, Sound
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「そうに」 describes the manner in which something seems, while 「そうな」 modifies a noun to indicate
      that it has the appearance of being a certain way. This differs from 「みたい」 which directly states
      a resemblance.
  - term: ように・ような
    meaning: As・like, Just like
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ように」 and 「ような」 often express a comparison to an established standard or a way of doing something,
      whereas 「みたい」 focuses on a visual or direct resemblance.
  - term: らしい ①
    meaning: Seems like, Apparently, I heard
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「らしい」 indicates information obtained from an external source or hearsay, unlike 「みたい」 which
      is based on the speaker's own observation.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「みたい」 is best used when you have some direct
  evidence or visual confirmation for the resemblance. 「ようだ」 is suitable for more formal situations or
  when the conclusion is based on reasoning or indirect information. 「そう」 often involves a more subjective
  feeling or inference, while 「らしい」 relies on reported information. The forms 「みたいに・みたいな」 and 「ように・ような」
  have specific grammatical roles in modifying verbs and nouns respectively. Pay attention to the source
  of your information and the formality of the context when choosing between these similar expressions.
