  The grammar point **てもいい** expresses that something is permissible or acceptable. It translates to "it's okay even if...", "can I...?", or "...is also okay".

  *  It follows a noun, い-adjective, or な-adjective.
  *  For nouns, simply add **でもいい**.
  *  For い-adjectives, change the final い to **く** and add **てもいい**.
  *  For な-adjectives, add **でもいい**.

  While **てもいい** can be used on its own, omitting the **も** makes the statement more direct and casual. It's generally advisable to keep the **も** when speaking with people you don't know well.

  Similar to the verb + **てもいい** structure, this form can also be used as a question to ask for permission or confirmation. To form a question, simply add **ですか** (formal) or **の** (casual) to the end.

false_friends:
  - term: Verb + てもいい
    meaning: It's okay to, It's alright to, Can/may
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both express permission, 「Verb + てもいい」 specifically applies to actions, indicating that
      performing the verb is allowed. 「てもいい」 without a preceding verb applies to states or conditions.
  - term: てもかまわない
    meaning: It doesn't matter if, I don't mind
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「てもかまわない」 is similar but has a stronger nuance of indifference or lack of objection. 「てもいい」
      implies permission or acceptance, while 「てもかまわない」 suggests that something doesn't pose a problem
      to the speaker.
  - term: ても
    meaning: Even if, Even though
    kind: related
    nuance: 「ても」 expresses a concession, indicating that something is true despite another factor. 「てもいい」
      builds upon this by saying that even if that condition is true, it's still okay.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that while 「Verb + てもいい」 and 「てもいい」 both indicate
  permission, the former relates to actions, and the latter to states or conditions. 「てもかまわない」 expresses
  a lack of concern, which is a slightly different nuance than the simple permission of 「てもいい」. 「ても」 simply
  introduces a concessional clause, whereas 「てもいい」 uses that clause to express permissibility.
