writeup: '上に is a grammar pattern that functions as a slightly formal way of saying "and" in Japanese.
  It indicates that something is ''in addition to (A)'', ''as well as (A)'', or ''besides (A)''. Literally,
  it conveys the idea of ''(B) on top of (A)''. 上に can be used after the plain form of verbs and い-adjectives,
  な-adjectives followed by な, and nouns followed by の. It''s also common to see である上に used with な-adjectives
  and nouns. **Important Consideration**: 上に is used to connect elements that have a similar positive
  or negative connotation. You would use it to link two good things or two bad things.'

post_example_writeup: Remember that 上に is used to add similar qualities. Avoid using it to connect a positive
  attribute with a negative one, as this can sound unnatural. For instance, while 「彼はハンサムな上に優しい」 sounds
  natural, 「彼はハンサムな上に失礼だ」 feels off. For such contrasting ideas, other conjunctions are more suitable.
