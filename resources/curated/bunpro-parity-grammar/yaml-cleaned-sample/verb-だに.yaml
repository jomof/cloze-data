  As mentioned in our だに + しない grammar point, だに is an adverbial particle that shares a similar meaning to さえ and すら "even", but is more commonly found in classical literature. It presents (A) as 'minimum' or 'light' examples, and therefore implies that anything greater than (A) would be more than can be handled, imagined, etc. In this use, it is often translated as "just (A)", or "merely (A)". だに will appear directly following verbs in their dictionary form. This is a formal structure and will be seen far more often in literature than it will be spoken. Despite this, it is actually quite common in anime and manga when characters are being dramatic.

  As (A) presents a 'minimum', it will often be a word that expresses something that depicts the difference between reality and fantasy. For example, if (A) was 想像するだに "even in my imagination". The 'minimum' is the imagination, for which the opposite end of the spectrum would be 'in reality'.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While the dictionary form is the most common, the past tense (た-form) can occasionally be used to emphasize a past experience that is still vivid in one's mind. The negative form is quite rare.
examples:
  - japanese: あんな地獄みたいな職場にまた明日も行かないと考えるだに気が重くなる。

      me feel depressed.
    conjugation: dictionary form

      feelings in a casual setting.
  - japanese: 彼のことを思い出すだに、胸が締め付けられる。
    english: Just remembering him makes my heart ache.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: semi-formal
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「思い出すだに、胸が締め付けられる」 uses slightly more formal phrasing with 「締め付けられる」 compared to a purely
      casual expression.
  - japanese: 部長からもらった仕事の量を見るだに、やる気が失せる。
    english: I lose all motivation by merely looking at the amount of work my boss gave me.
    conjugation: dictionary form

      「失せる」 is slightly more formal than saying 「なくなる」.

    english: 'Article: ''For a human being, even just thinking about eating ticks is repulsive.'''
    conjugation: dictionary form

      sense of disgust.
  - japanese: 小説:「クトゥルフは見るだに正気を失ってしまうほどたいへん恐ろしい化物であるらしい。」
    english: 'Novel: ''It is said that Cthulhu is a monster so awfully scary that one goes mad just by

      article.
  - japanese: 小説:「ただ、その事故の話を聞いただに古傷が疼く。」
    english: 'Novel: ''Just hearing a conversation about that accident makes my old wound throb with pain.'''
    conjugation: past (plain)
    register: formal
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: 「聞いたダニ古傷が疼く」 uses the past tense of the verb to emphasize the single act of hearing about
      the accident that triggers the pain. This is more literary.
    etymology: 「古傷（ふるきず）」 means an old wound, both literally and figuratively, referring to a past trauma.
  - japanese: 記事:「太陽の中心の温度は想像するだに恐ろしい。」
    english: 'Article: ''Even just imagining the temperature at the center of the sun is terrifying.'''

      the unimaginable nature of the sun's core temperature.
post_example_writeup: The examples demonstrate how 「だに」 emphasizes the minimum action or thought required
  to evoke a significant reaction. Notice the variety of emotional responses, from depression and sadness
  to lack of motivation and fear. The register is consistently formal or semi-formal, reflecting the grammar
  point's nature.
