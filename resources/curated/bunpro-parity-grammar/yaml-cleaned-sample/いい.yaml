  **いい** is an い-adjective that means "good" in Japanese. It's a very common and fundamental word. What makes **いい** a bit special is its conjugation. Unlike most other い-adjectives, the first 「い」 in **いい** changes to 「よ」 in many conjugated forms. For example, the polite form is **いいです**, but the past tense is **よかったです**.

  You might also see **いい** written as **良い**. Technically, they mean the same thing, but **良い** (pronounced *yoi*) often sounds more formal or traditional. In everyday conversation, **いい** is much more common.

  **Important Consideration:** Be careful not to confuse **よく** (meaning "often", "frequently", or "well") with conjugated forms of **いい**. **よく** is a completely different word and can even be written with different kanji (e.g., 良く, 能く).

post_example_writeup: Remember that the kanji 良い is also read as *yoi*. While it carries the same meaning
  as いい, it's generally considered more formal or literary. In most everyday situations, using the hiragana
  いい is perfectly acceptable and more common.

  - term: い-Adjectives
    meaning: Adjectives ending in い
    kind: grammatical term
    nuance: While いい is an い-adjective, it conjugates irregularly compared to most other い-adjectives.
post_false_friends_writeup: When conjugating い-adjectives, remember the unique behavior of いい. Most い-adjectives
  simply drop the い and add く for the adverbial form or かった for the past tense (e.g., 高い -> 高く, 高かった).
  However, いい changes to よく and よかった. Pay close attention to this difference to avoid grammatical errors.
