writeup: |-
  The verb くれる in Japanese is very similar to 与える (to bestow). The primary difference is that くれる (primarily written in hiragana) means to "bestow to the speaker" (or someone in the speaker's inner circle). In this way, てくれる is the opposite of てあげる, which conveys that someone (usually the speaker) gives (an action) to another person that is outside of their inner circle. てくれる is commonly translated as "would you do (A) for me", as a question, or "someone did (A) for me", as a statement.

  When asking for a favor, てくれる can be shortened to てくれ. However, this is very casual and should not be used with strangers or anyone you don't know well. As an English equivalent, てくれ sounds similar to phrases like "would ya do (A)" or "could ya do (A)?"

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  てくれる expresses that the action is done for the speaker's benefit.
  *  てくれ is a very casual imperative form.
  *  てくれる is one of the more casual ways to ask for a favor, with てもらう being slightly more polite.
  *  ていただく (the humble speech variation of てくれる) is even more polite than either of these!

post_false_friends_writeup: It's important to distinguish between grammar points that express giving versus
  receiving actions. 「てあげる」 is about giving a favor, while 「てくれる」 and 「てもらう」 are about receiving one.
  The level of politeness also varies significantly. 「てくれる」 is relatively casual, 「てもらう」 is more polite,
  and 「ていただく」 is even more formal. When making requests, 「ないでください」 is for asking someone not to do something,
  the opposite of 「てくれる」.
