details:
  Register: Casual
  使用域: タメ語
etymology: Although たって is widely considered a casual form of ても, it originally stems from たとて, which
  is a combination of the auxiliary verb た, and the particle とて, which itself is thought to be an old-fashioned
  abbreviation of と言っても. In this way, the modern abbreviation of たって still reflects the original extended
  nuance of たと言っても 'even if (A) is said, (B)'.
writeup: |-
  たって is a casual structure that carries the same meaning as 'ても' or 'でも', and can be used with a wide variety of words. Common translations include "even if (A)", "even though (A)", or "no matter how (A)".

  **Conjugation:**
  - For verbs, たって conjugates in the standard way that the た past-tense form usually would.
  - For い-Adjectives, たって attaches to the conjugative く-form.
  - For nouns and な-Adjectives, た will change to だ, and だって will then be used with the stem noun or adjective.

  or determination. だって has additional meanings, so context is crucial. For more formal situations, use
  たとえ〜ても or にしても.
