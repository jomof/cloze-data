writeup: を限りに (**o kagiri ni**) follows a noun to indicate a specific time or event that marks the end
  of something. It conveys the sense that something will cease or no longer continue after that point.
  It can be translated as "ending with," "as of," or "after (this specific time/event)." This structure
  is often used for making announcements, declarations, or conveying a final decision regarding a period
  of activity. It has a slightly more formal tone compared to expressions like 限りで (**kagiri de**). A
  unique idiomatic expression using this grammar is 声を限りに (**koe wo kagiri ni**), meaning "at the top
  of one's lungs" or "as loudly as one can."

  shows its broader capability to signify the limit of an action or ability. Remember that を限りに often
  implies a definitive end to a continuing action or state.
