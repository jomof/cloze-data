writeup: ただ～のみ is an expression that conveys the idea that **only** a certain action or state remains
  or is necessary. It combines ただ, meaning "merely" or "only," and the adverbial particle のみ, which also
  means "just" or "only" but carries a more formal tone than だけ. The construction emphasizes that all
  other possibilities have been exhausted or are irrelevant, leaving a single course of action or a single
  prevailing condition. Often, the element preceding ただ～のみ is a verb implying movement, continuation,
  or hope, underscoring the sense that everything else has been done, and now one can only wait or continue
  on a single path. While する verbs are common, in more literary contexts, ある can replace する, shifting
  the focus from the action itself to its mere existence.
