  **といえば**, **と言うと**, and **と言ったら** are all expressions that are translated quite closely to "speaking of (A)", or "if it were the case that (A)". Each of these structures has a slightly different nuance, but they are largely used in the same situations.

  *  **といえば** - More hypothetical, "were it (A)".
  *  **と言うと** - More concrete, "if it's (A)".
  *  **と言ったら** - More situational, "when it's (A)".

  These constructions are most commonly used after nouns, in response to something that has already been mentioned in the conversation (usually by someone else). The thing that has already been said is quite often the 'trigger' for someone remembering something, causing them to interject with と言えば.

  **Important Consideration:** Although these phrases are used in response to something that has already been mentioned, their purpose is to change the topic of the conversation somehow (or to add new information), rather than continuing along with the same subject.

  important to note their subtle differences. **といえば** specifically connects the new topic to something
  previously mentioned, acting as a bridge. **そういえば** is more of a sudden realization or recollection.
  **ところで** signifies a clearer shift to an unrelated subject. **は** and **って** are primarily topic markers
  without the same connective nuance as **といえば**.
