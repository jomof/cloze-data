  それにしても is an expression used in Japanese, building upon にしても ("even though" or "even if"). It translates to "nevertheless" or "even so," highlighting that despite acknowledging a previous statement, the speaker's primary opinion or observation follows. Essentially, it indicates that while the speaker accepts the preceding point, there's more to consider. それにしても typically appears at the beginning of a sentence or immediately after a comma.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  It often introduces a statement that goes beyond or challenges expectations set by the previous context.
  *  It conveys a sense of mild surprise, emphasis, or a shift in focus.

  a mild sense of surprise or focuses on a point that goes beyond the initial statement, acknowledging
  the preceding context without necessarily contradicting it.
