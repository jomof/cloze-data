  「誰 (だれ)」 is a pronoun used to ask about or refer to an unknown person. It's a fundamental word in Japanese for questions like "Who is it?" or "Who did that?". The meaning can subtly change depending on the particle that follows it. For example:

  *  「誰が (だれが)」: **Who** (as the subject)
  *  「誰と (だれと)」: **With whom**
  *  「誰に (だれに)」: **To whom**
  *  「誰を (だれを)」: **Whom** (as the direct object)
  *  「誰の (だれの)」: **Whose**
  *  「誰か (だれか)」: **Someone**, **somebody**
  *  「誰も (だれも)」 followed by a negative verb: **Nobody**, **no one**

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Politeness: In polite or formal situations, you'll use 「どなた」 instead of 「誰」. For extremely polite situations, such as when answering the phone or greeting a visitor you don't recognize, 「どちら様 (どちらさま)」 is used.
