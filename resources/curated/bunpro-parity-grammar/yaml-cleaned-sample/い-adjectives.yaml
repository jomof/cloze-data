  In Japanese, い-Adjectives (い形容詞, *i-keiyoushi*) are a category of adjectives that always end with the hiragana い (*i*) in their dictionary form. They directly modify nouns and can also function as predicates. A key characteristic of い-Adjectives is their ability to conjugate, allowing them to express different tenses and polarities.

  **Important Characteristics:**

  *  **Dictionary Form:** Always ends in い (e.g., 高(たか)い - *takai* - expensive).
  *  **Direct Modification:** い-Adjectives precede the noun they modify (e.g., 高(たか)い山(やま) - *takai yama* - a tall mountain).
  *  **Predicate Use:** They can function as the predicate of a sentence (e.g., 山(やま)が高(たか)いです - *Yama ga takai desu* - The mountain is tall).
  *  **Conjugation:** い-Adjectives conjugate to express different meanings, such as past tense, negative, and te-form.

  **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

  Be careful not to confuse い-Adjectives with nouns or な-Adjectives that happen to end in い. For example, きれい (*kirei* - beautiful) is a な-Adjective, not an い-Adjective, even though it ends in い.

  **Politeness:**

  To make い-Adjectives polite, you simply add です (*desu*) at the end of the sentence when used as a predicate (e.g., 楽(たの)しいです - *tanoshii desu* - It is fun). It's important to note that while adding です is common and considered natural, grammatically speaking, い-Adjectives can stand alone as polite predicates without it.

false_friends:
  - term: きれい
    meaning: Beautiful, clean
    kind: similar sounding
    nuance: Unlike い-Adjectives, 「きれい」 is a な-Adjective and requires な when modifying nouns and だ/です to
      function as a predicate.
  - term: 嫌(きら)い
    meaning: Dislike
    kind: similar sounding
    nuance: Unlike い-Adjectives, 「嫌い」 is a な-Adjective and conjugates like one.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, always remember that true い-Adjectives have the い as a
  separate hiragana character at the end, not as part of the kanji itself (if kanji is used). Pay attention
  to how these words behave grammatically; な-Adjectives require a な before nouns and take だ/です as a copula,
  whereas い-Adjectives don't need な and can be directly followed by です for politeness.
