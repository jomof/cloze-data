writeup: The grammar point **といわず** is used to express that something applies not just to A or B, but
  to everything within a particular category or scope. It emphasizes the comprehensiveness of an action
  or state. You can think of it as saying "without needing to mention A and without needing to mention
  B, it applies to everything". The structure is **noun A といわず noun B といわず**, followed by a statement
  about the broader group they belong to. Both noun A and noun B should be representative examples of
  that larger group. This grammar is quite formal and often found in written language or more formal spoken
  contexts.
