  The negative form of the verb 兼(か)ねる, 「かねない」, is a grammar pattern that indicates a **possibility** of something happening, especially when it's something the speaker can't control. It often translates to "might (A)," "could be (A)," or "(A) is possible." This structure connects to the ます-stem of verbs or follows nouns with に. Both kanji (兼ねない) and hiragana (かねない) forms are used. It's common to see 「かねない」 after conditional phrases like と, ば, たら, or でも, indicating that "if (A) happens, (B) might also occur."

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While often used for negative outcomes, 「かねない」 can also express a sarcastic wish or observation.
  *  The verb 兼(か)ねる means "to do two things at once" or "to combine." The negative 「かねない」 can be thought of as something being "not out of the realm of possibility."

post_example_writeup: While 「かねない」 often implies a negative consequence, context is crucial. Sometimes,
  it can express a surprising positive possibility, often with a hint of sarcasm or disbelief, like in
  the example about passing the test. The speaker is implying that passing is *possible* if they study,
  but it might be a surprising outcome given their usual study habits.

    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to 「かねない」 in expressing possibility, 「恐れがある」 emphasizes the speaker's worry
      or fear about a potential negative outcome. 「かねない」 is more neutral regarding the speaker's emotional
      state.
  - term: なくはない
    meaning: It's not that…, Kind of, might, Slightly, Somewhat, In some respects
    kind: synonym

      impossible* but not necessarily likely, whereas 「かねない」 implies a more significant potential.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up these similar expressions, remember that 兼(か)ねる focuses
  on the **inability** to do something. 「恐れがある」 emphasizes the **fear or risk** associated with a possibility.
  「なくはない」 denotes a **weak possibility** or something being *not entirely untrue*. 「かねない」 on the other
  hand, speaks to a more **tangible possibility**, often of something undesirable, but not always.
