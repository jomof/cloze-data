writeup: 「へいく」 is a common construction used when describing a place that someone or something is "heading"
  towards. The particles 「に」 and 「へ」 are mostly interchangeable, but there is a slight difference in nuance.
  「に」 has the nuance of "going to", while 「へ」 emphasizes the direction or the journey. While the example
  sentences might seem the same at first glance, 「へ」 focuses more on the journey, whereas 「に」 puts more
  emphasis on the destination. This distinction holds true for other uses of 「に」 and 「へ」 as well. 「に」
  will always place more emphasis on the destination of an action, while 「へ」 will highlight the distance
  traveled or the path between the origin and destination.

false_friends:
  - term: ていく
    meaning: To ~ and go, To go on, To start
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「へいく」 which focuses on the direction, 「ていく」 indicates a movement away from the speaker
      or a continuation of an action into the future.
  - term: Verb + にいく
    meaning: To go to ~ (to do something)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both involve going somewhere, 「Verb + にいく」 specifically implies going for a particular
      purpose, which isn't necessarily the focus of 「へいく」.
  - term: へ
    meaning: To, Toward
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「へ」 is the particle indicating direction, while 「へいく」 is the verb phrase meaning 'to go to'.
  - term: くる
    meaning: To come
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「くる」 means 'to come' towards the speaker, the opposite direction of 「へいく」.
  - term: いらっしゃる
    meaning: To be (Honorific), To come (Honorific), To go (Honorific)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「いらっしゃる」 is the honorific equivalent of both 'to come' and 'to go', used when speaking about
      someone of higher status. 「へいく」 is neutral.
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions are related to movement, it's important to understand
  their specific nuances. 「ていく」 indicates movement away or continuation, 「Verb + にいく」 specifies a purpose
  for going, 「へ」 is just the directional particle, 「くる」 is the opposite of going, and 「いらっしゃる」 is a respectful
  way of saying 'to go' or 'to come'.
