writeup: |-
  The expression **と考えられる** is used to present an objective opinion or possibility. It combines the particle **と** (which often marks a quote or thought), and the passive potential form of the verb **考える (かんがえる)**, which means "to think". The passive potential form **考えられる (かんがえられる)** can be translated as "can be thought of" or "is conceivable". Therefore, **と考えられる** essentially means "it can be considered that..." or "it is thought that...".

  Since it starts with **と**, this structure often comes at the end of a phrase, effectively quoting the thought or consideration. It's important to note that **と考えられる** leans towards expressing a judgment or possibility based on available information. When you want to express a more subjective opinion or personal feeling, **と思われる (おもわれる)** is a better choice.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Objectivity vs. Subjectivity:** **と考えられる** emphasizes an objective viewpoint, relying more on observable facts or logical deductions. **と思われる** highlights a personal opinion or feeling.
  *  **Comparison to 考えられている:** While both translate to something like "is considered", **考えられている** typically refers to widely accepted or established opinions, while **と考えられる** focuses more on judgments or conceivable possibilities.
