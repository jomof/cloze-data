writeup: |-
  **あわよくば** combines the archaic い-adjective **あわよい** (convenient, timely) with the conditional particle **ば** (if). It translates to phrases like "if luck is on my side," "if the time is right," "if possible," or "all going well." Despite its historical roots, **あわよくば** functions as a single adverb in modern Japanese, typically preceding a phrase that expresses a desired outcome.

  **Fun Fact:** The **ば** in **あわよくば** attaches to the **く** form of the い-adjective **あわよい** rather than the modern **ければ** form. This reflects older Japanese conjugation rules for い-adjectives in conditional clauses.
