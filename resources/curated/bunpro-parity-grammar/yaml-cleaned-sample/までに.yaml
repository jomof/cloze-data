writeup: までに is a combination of the adverbial particle まで and the case-marking particle に. Think of まで
  as indicating the endpoint or limit, and に as marking the target or destination. Therefore, までに indicates
  a **deadline** or a point in time by which an action must be completed. It emphasizes the **latest possible
  time** for something to happen. It's attached to nouns indicating time or verbs in their dictionary
  form, indicating "by the time that" something happens. The key difference between まで and までに is that
  まで indicates a duration up to a certain point (something continues until that point), while までに indicates
  a deadline for completion.

  - term: Noun + まで
    meaning: Until, Till, To (but no further than)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike までに, 「まで」 focuses on the duration of time leading up to a point, not necessarily a
      deadline for completing an action.
  - term: Verb + まで
    meaning: Until (something) happens
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to noun + まで, verb + まで indicates the continuation of a state or action up to a certain
      point, without the implication of a deadline for a separate action.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, think of まで as indicating "up to" a certain point in time
  or event, while までに specifies a point in time before which something needs to be done. If the emphasis
  is on the duration, use まで. If the emphasis is on the deadline for an action, use までに.
