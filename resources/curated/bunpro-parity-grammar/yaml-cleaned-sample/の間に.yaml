  間に is an expression that can be used with almost any type of word to indicate that event **(B)** happens or exists within the time or space of **(A)**. It can also denote a period or space *until* something happens or exists. It combines the noun 間 (interval, space) and the case-marking particle に.

  When used with verbs or い-adjectives, 間に follows directly. However, の is required after nouns, and な is required after な-adjectives.

  When 間に expresses the period *until* something happens, it's often paired with まで.

  Crucially, with 間に, the **(B)** action or location usually occurs at a specific point *during* **(A)** and doesn't necessarily span the entire duration of **(A)**. Think of it as "in the span of (A)", highlighting the interval.

  at a specific point within the larger timeframe. For instance, in "I told you before not to make me
  laugh while I'm yawning!", the laughing happens *during* the yawn, not throughout the entire duration
  of the yawn.
