writeup: なり is a somewhat formal Japanese particle that expresses the idea of something happening **immediately**
  after something else. It translates to "as soon as," "the moment," or "when." It attaches directly to
  the **dictionary form of a verb**. The second part of the sentence often describes a surprising event
  or a reaction driven by strong emotion or will. It's important to note that なり is typically used when
  talking about **other people's actions**, not your own. Think of it like describing a scene unfolding
  quickly.
