  たりとも is a grammar pattern that is most often used in negative sentences to emphasize that **nothing**, not even a single instance, is an exception. It follows either number words or nouns. Possible translations include "not even one (A)" and "not a single (A)". Literally, たりとも can be broken down into the auxiliary verb たり, which means "presenting examples," and the conjunction particle とも, which means "presenting approximate limitations." Thus, a literal interpretation could be "even limited to (A) as an example, not (B)," with "not (B)" indicated by the negative structure in the sentence's latter part.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  This is a very **formal** expression and is rarely used in everyday conversation.
  *  The set phrase **何人(なんびと)たりとも** ("no matter who it is, no exceptions") is a common usage and might be encountered more frequently than other applications of this pattern.
