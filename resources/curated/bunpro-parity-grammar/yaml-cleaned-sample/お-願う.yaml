writeup: 'お～願う is a **humble speech** expression in Japanese used for making requests, similar to お～ください
  "please do (A)". As with many other polite structures, the prefix お is generally used with words of
  Japanese origin, while ご is used for most Chinese-origin kanji compounds. 願う itself is a う-verb meaning
  "to petition". The literal translation is akin to "I petition that you do (A) for me," which might sound
  overly formal in English but conveys the sense that someone is doing a favor. Due to its polite nature,
  お～願う almost always appears in its ます-form, お～願います. Interestingly, words of Western origin, like katakana
  loanwords, often omit both お and ご, appearing simply with 願う attached to the end. **Important Consideration**:
  As お～願う is a more polite way of saying お～ください, or even just てください, it''s primarily used in formal settings
  like announcements or business communications. Using it in everyday conversation might sound overly
  formal or even sarcastic.'

  more formal and humble end of the politeness spectrum when making requests. 「お～ください」 is also polite

  instructions. 「ないでください」 is for making negative requests, asking someone not to do something.
