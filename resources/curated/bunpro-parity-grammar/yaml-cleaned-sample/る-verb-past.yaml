  To express the past tense for る-verbs in Japanese, the final 「る」 is removed, and either 「た」 (casual) or 「ました」 (polite) is added. It's interesting to note that 「ました」 is actually a combination of 「ます」 and 「た」. This means 「た」 is the core element indicating the past tense, while 「ます」 functions to maintain politeness. When 「た」 is used, it can convey a few different but related meanings:

  *  **Past:** Indicates an action that occurred at some point in the past (e.g., "did," "was").
  *  **Completion:** Suggests an action that has been fully finished (e.g., "done").
  *  **Continuation (Resultant State):** Describes a present state that is a result of a past action (e.g., "has been done").
