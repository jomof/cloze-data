writeup: |-
  To express "except (A)" or "besides (A)," the grammar point 以外 (いがい) is used. The kanji combination is composed of 以 (い), meaning "by means of," and 外 (がい), meaning "outside." Therefore, a literal interpretation could be "everything outside of (A)." It effectively highlights what is **not** included in a certain group or category. Think of it as drawing a circle around everything *except* what you specify.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  以外 is attached directly to the noun or noun phrase that you are excluding.
  *  While 以外 can sometimes express surprise (意外), the kanji are different, and the context will usually make the intended meaning clear. 意外 means "unexpected" or "surprising."

    etymology: Here, 意外 is used, not 以外, to express surprise. The kanji 意 (mind) and 外 (outside) imply
      something unexpected.

  on the context. It can be used for simple exclusions, expressing preferences, or even highlighting something

    meaning: Other, Another, Any other, Anything else, As well as, Besides, In addition

      exclusion. For instance, 「他に何かありますか」 (Is there anything else?) focuses on adding more.
  - term: はともかく

      to focus on another point. For example, 「値段はともかく、質がいい」 (Setting aside the price, the quality is
      good).
  - term: を除いて
    meaning: Except, With the exception of, Unless
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 除いて is a more formal and direct way of saying "except." While similar to 以外, it often carries
      a slightly stronger sense of removal or exclusion. For example, 「彼を除いて全員賛成した」 (Everyone except him
      agreed).

    meaning: No...but, Nothing else but, None other than
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 以外, をおいてほかに〜ない emphasizes the uniqueness or only possibility of something. It has a
      stronger nuance of exclusivity. For example, 「彼をおいてほかに適任者はいない」 (There is no one more suitable than
      him).
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 以外 focuses on what is *outside* a specific
  group. ほかに considers other possibilities, はともかく sets something aside, 除いて is a more formal "except,"
  and をおいてほかに〜ない highlights something as the only option.
