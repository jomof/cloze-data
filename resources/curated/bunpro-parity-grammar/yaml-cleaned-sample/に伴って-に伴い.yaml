writeup: 「に伴って」 and 「に伴い」 both translate to phrases like "as," "due to," "along with," or "resulting in."
  The core meaning comes from the verb **伴う (tomonau)**, which means "to accompany." Think of it like
  two things happening together or one thing following another closely. While it doesn't always mean (A)
  *directly causes* (B), it strongly implies that (A) has a significant influence on the change in (B).
  You'll see 「に伴う」 modifying nouns directly. 「に伴って」 can describe gradual, simultaneous changes or sudden
  events where one follows the other. It emphasizes the idea of things occurring in conjunction.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up these expressions, consider the specific nuance you want
  to convey. If you want to emphasize a close, simultaneous relationship or a consequence, 「に伴って・に伴い」
  is suitable. If you want to highlight doing something together, use 「と共に」. For a specific trigger or
  opportunity, 「を契機に」 is better. If you're making a comparison, use 「と並んで」. For proportional changes,
  「につれて」 works well. 「きっかけ」 is for the initial cause, 「にしたがって」 for following instructions, and 「に沿って」
  for adhering to a path or plan.
