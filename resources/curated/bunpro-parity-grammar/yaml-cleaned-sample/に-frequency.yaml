writeup: The particle に can indicate the **frequency** of an action or event. In this usage, it follows
  a time period (e.g., 一ヶ月 "one month," 一週間 "one week," 一年 "one year") and precedes a number indicating
  how many times something occurs within that period. Think of に here as marking the 'destination' or
  boundary within which the counted events take place.
