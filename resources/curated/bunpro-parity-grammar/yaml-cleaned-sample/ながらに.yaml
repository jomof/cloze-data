  The grammar point 「ながらに」 combines the suffix 「ながら」 meaning "while" with the case-marking particle 「に」. It indicates that something (B) occurs or exists in a state that remains unchanged from a previous state (A). It can often be translated as "while being (A), (B)" or "(A) as always, (B)". 「ながらに」 typically follows nouns or the stem form of verbs. Adding 「して」 to the end, forming 「ながらにして」, does not alter the meaning.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  「ながらに」 emphasizes that the state of (A) persists during (B).
  *  It's used with a relatively limited set of words, so it's best to observe common pairings rather than trying to use it freely.
