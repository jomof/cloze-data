writeup: '## 1. あげる is used as an auxiliary verb with the て form of verbs. The meaning of Verb-てあげる is
  ''do something for someone'' or ''do someone a favour by doing something''. The restriction which applies
  to あげる1 also applies to あげる2. Namely, sentences with Verb-てあげる are descriptions from the viewpoint of
  the benefactor (i.e., the person in subject position); therefore, the indirect object must not be the
  first person or a person the speaker empathizes with. (⇨ ㊦ あげる (1)1, Note 1) Thus, (1a) and (1b) are
  ungrammatical.'
formation: "## \n\n- Vて\n- あげる\n- 話してあげる\n- talk for someone’s sake\n- 食べてあげる\n- eat for someone’s sake"
