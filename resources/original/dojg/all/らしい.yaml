writeup: '## 1. らしい is generally used when the speaker makes a conjecture based on some information which
  he has heard, read or seen. What he has heard is especially important. Unlike そうだ2, which expresses
  a simple guess based on what the speaker sees, らしい is used when the conjecture is based on more reliable
  information. (⇨ そうだ2) (For a comprehensive comparison of conjecture expressions, see (⇨ ようだ, Related
  Expressions.)'
