writeup: '## 1. もらう, which is one of a set of giving and receiving verbs, means ''get''. Unlike the English
  get, however, もらう is used only when the receiver is the first person or someone with whom the speaker
  empathizes (usually a member of the speaker''s in-group). Thus, (1) is unacceptable.'
