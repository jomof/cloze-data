writeup: '## 1. が2, like ''but'' in English, combines two sentences which express contrastive ideas. However,
  が is much weaker than ''but'' in that it is sometimes used simply to combine two sentences for stylistic
  reasons even if those two sentences do not represent contrastive ideas. For example, the が in (1) is
  used simply as a transition word to connect two sentences.'
