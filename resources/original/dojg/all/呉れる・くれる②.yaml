writeup: '## 1. くれる is used as an auxiliary verb with Verbて. The meaning of Verbてくれる is "someone does
  the first person (or someone with whom the speaker empathizes) a favor by doing something". Like sentences
  with くれる as a main verb, sentences with Verbてくれる are stated from the viewpoint of the person who receives
  the favor and the receiver must be the first person or someone the speaker empathizes with (usually
  a member of the speaker''s in-group〉. Thus, (1a) is grammatical, but (1b) is not.'
