writeup: '## 1. "Sentenceはず" expresses the speakers expectation, not in the sense of hoping or looking
  forward to something, but in the sense that the proposition expressed by Sentence should be true or
  come true. Thus, when the speaker uses はず he is not merely guessing, but stating a proposition based
  on reliable information or knowledge.'
