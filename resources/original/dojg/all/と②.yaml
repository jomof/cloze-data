writeup: '## 1. When Y is the subject of a clause, X to indicates that X and Y have a reciprocal relationship.
  For example, in Example (a), the fact that Tom often plays tennis with John necessarily means that John
  often plays tennis with Tom; in other words, it means that they have a reciprocal relationship. Thus,
  と often corresponds to the English ''with'', as in ''in the company of''. と also appears with such reciprocal
  verbs and adjectives as 結婚する ''marry'', 喧嘩する ''quarrel'', 話し合う ''discuss with'', 似る ''resemble'', 違う
  ''differ'' and 同じだ ''be the same''. (See Examples (b), (c) and (d).)'
