writeup: '## 1. いる is used as an auxiliary verb with Verb-て and expresses the continuation of an action
  or state. In general, if Verb-て expresses an action which can continue or be repeated, Verb-て expresses
  the continuation of the action. If Verb-て is a verb indicating a momentary action which cannot be repeated,
  Verb-て expresses the idea that something happened to X and X maintains the state which was created by
  that event. Key Sentence and Example (a) are examples of the first usage and Examples (b), (c) and (d)
  are examples of the second usage. Note in Example (d) that 知る the dictionary form of 知って, means ''to
  get to know'' and 知っている expresses the continuation of the state after the speaker got to know Miss Suzuki,
  which is expressed by know in English. It is also noted, however, that ''not to know'' is not 知っていない
  but 知らない.'
