writeup: '## 1. あげる is one of a set of giving and receiving verbs; the meaning is ''give''. However, あげる
  cannot be used when the indirect object is the first person (i.e., I or we) or a person with whom the
  speaker empathizes (usually a member of the speaker''s in-group). Thus, (1a) and (1b) are ungrammatical.'
