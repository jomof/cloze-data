writeup: '## 1. {Verbます/Adjective(い/な)stem} そうだ expresses the speaker''s conjecture based on visual information.
  Thus, this expression can be used only when the speaker directly observes something. The speaker''s
  conjecture concerns an event which might take place in the future or the present state of someone or
  something. In other words, そうだ2 cannot be used to express the speaker''s conjecture concerning a past
  event or state.'
