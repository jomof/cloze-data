writeup: |-
  ## 1. The meaning of Sentence1たらSentence2 varies depending on the contents of Sentence1 and Sentence2 and also on the situation in which this construction is used. However, Sentence always represents an antecedent and Sentence2 a subsequence. For example, in Key Sentence, Mr. Yamada's coming precedes the speaker's returning home. Likewise, in Example (a), the speaker's asking his teacher precedes his understanding something. If this relation does not hold, this construction cannot be used. For example, (1) cannot be expressed by the たら construction because the event of Sentence1, the speaker's going to Chicago, does not precede the event of Sentence2, his going there by car.
