writeup: '## 1. In ordinary circumstances, おVerbますになる is used when the speaker describes someone''s action
  or state with respect. However, if a social norm requires the speaker to talk in honorific speech, the
  honorific form is used, even if the speaker does not respect the person he talks about. Politeness is
  expressed in this form by two elements: first by the polite prefix お, and second by the verb なる which
  describes someone''s action or state indirectly. This indirectness is a common strategy in polite expressions.'
formation: "## \n\n- おVます\n- になる\n- お話しになる\n- Someone (will) talk\n- お教えになる\n- Someone (will) teach"
