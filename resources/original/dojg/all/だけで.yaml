writeup: '## The choice of the tense of the verb before だけ depends on (1) whether or not the action expressed
  by the verb (Action 1) was taken in the past, and (2) whether or not the action/event expressed by the
  verb (Action 1) precedes the action/event expressed by the main verbal (Action 2). If A1 precedes A2
  and A1 is a past action, the verb must be in the past tense (example, Key Sentence (B) and Example (e)).
  If A1 precedes A2 and A1 is not a past action, the verb is commonly in the nonpast tense, although the
  past tense is also acceptable (example, Examples (f) - (h)). If A1 does not precede A2 and A1 is a past
  action, the verb is commonly in the nonpast, although the past tense is also acceptable (example, Example
  (d)). If A1 does not precede A2 and A1 is not a past action, the verb must be in the nonpast (example,
  Key Sentence (A) and Examples(a) - (c)).'
