writeup: '## 1. が marks the subject of a sentence when the information expressed by the subject is first
  introduced in a discourse. When the subject is presented as the topic (that is, the information has
  already been introduced into the discourse), however, the topic marker は replaces が. (⇨ は1) Consider
  the following discourse, a typical opening in folktales, which illustrates the different uses of が and
  は.'
