  When 方 is attached to the ます stem of a verb, it conveys the meaning of the "way of doing (A)". This is the same as 方's standard meaning of "way" or "direction." When used with する verbs, you'll sometimes see the construction 仕方. This has the exact same meaning as 方 without kanji and can be thought of as meaning "way of dealing/attending to (A)," since 仕 originally means "to attend to (A)." In these cases, the する verb is followed by の, and then 仕方.

  **Important Note:** After attaching 方 to a verb, the entire expression functions as a noun phrase. This means it can be followed by particles such as は, を, and others to create longer sentences.
