writeup: |-
  から言うと (appearing with or without kanji) is a phrase in Japanese used to express a particular viewpoint or standpoint from which an evaluation, conclusion, or opinion can be drawn. The と here indicates an assumption, similar to saying "if I were to speak from the perspective of...". Therefore, から言えば may also be used with essentially the same meaning. Sometimes, the particles と or ば are omitted, resulting in から言って. This phrase always follows a noun (or noun phrase). The latter part of the sentence describes the evaluation, opinion, etc. This structure is similar to "speaking in terms of (A), (B)" or "what can be drawn from (A) is that (B)".

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  You generally cannot use "Name + から言うと" because a person isn't typically considered a 'situation' in this context. However, phrases like "Name の立場から言うと" are acceptable, as they specify the situation or position of the person.
  *  Because から言うと often highlights an overall situation, it's usually not used for momentary or purely visual observations. While grammatically correct, it can sound unnatural. For visual assessments, から見ると is a more appropriate choice.

post_false_friends_writeup: While all these phrases express a similar idea of considering something from
  a certain perspective, there are subtle nuances. 「で言うと」 is often used to specify a category. 「上」 can
  be broader and also means "in terms of". 「にしたら」 often relates to personal feelings. 「から見ると」 is suitable
  for visual or observational judgments. 「ことから」 highlights a factual basis, and 「からすると/すれば」 emphasizes
  inference. Pay attention to the specific context to choose the most natural phrasing.
