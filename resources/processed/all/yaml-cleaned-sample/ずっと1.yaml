  はい、皆さん！Let's learn about ずっと (zutto)! This adverb is super useful and has a couple of main meanings, but today we're focusing on its use to describe something that keeps going without stopping. Think of it like things are "constantly" or "always" happening.

  You can put ずっと at the beginning of a phrase to emphasize that the action or state continues for an extended period. It really brings home the idea that something is ongoing.

  Also, you can use ずっと after から (kara, "from") to say "ever since" a certain point in time. It highlights the duration from that starting point up until now.

  **Important Point:** The literal meaning of ずっと is something like "unwavering" or "unfaltering." Because of this nuance, when you use ずっと, it often implies a significant or maximum amount of whatever you're describing. It adds extra emphasis!
