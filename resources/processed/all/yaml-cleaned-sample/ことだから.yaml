  **ことだから** is a set expression used to indicate that the speaker is fairly certain about (B), based specifically on their understanding or experience with (A). It often translates to "it is exactly because (A) that (B)" or "precisely because it is (A), (B)".

  The structure of **ことだから** combines the noun **こと** ("thing", "matter"), the copula **だ**, and the particle **から** ("from", "because"). A literal interpretation could be "because it is the thing of (A), also (B)". This implies that due to (A) being a known or characteristic trait, (B) can be confidently inferred.

  When used to make assumptions, **ことだから** typically follows verbs in their dictionary form or nouns followed by **の**. For example:

  *  *Dictionary form verb + ことだから*: 「いつも遅れてくる**ことだから**、今日も遅れてくるだろう。」 (Because he *always comes* late, he'll probably be late today.)
  *  *Noun + の + ことだから*: 「先生**のことだから**、きっといいアドバイスをくれるでしょう。」 (Because it's the *teacher*, she'll probably give good advice.)

  **ことだから** can also follow verbs in other standard forms when situation (A) is considered a good opportunity to do (B).

  *  *Past tense verb + ことだから*: 「撮影が無事終わった**ことだから**、打ち上げでもしましょう！」 (Because the filming *finished* successfully, let's have a wrap party!)

  In some cases, **ことだから** simply emphasizes that (A) is the strong reason for (B). Again, verbs in various standard forms or nouns with **の** can precede it. The specific nuance often becomes clear from the context of the (B) part of the sentence.

  Essentially, **ことだから** conveys a sense of certainty based on established knowledge or typical behavior. You can often think of it as meaning, "given what we know about (A), it's a sure thing that (B)".

  emphasizes a particular reason. **ことから** focuses on the factual basis for a conclusion.
