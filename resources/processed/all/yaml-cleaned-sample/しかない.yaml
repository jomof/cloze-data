  **しかない** is a commonly used expression in Japanese that combines the adverbial particle **しか** with the い-adjective **ない**. It expresses the idea that there is no other option or choice available. This structure can be translated as "to have no choice but (A)" or "there is only (A)". **しかない** strongly emphasizes that nothing apart from the mentioned action is possible.

  To use **しかない**, simply attach it directly to the dictionary form (plain non-past) of the verb indicating the only possible action.

  Unlike **だけ**, which implies a choice was made from several options, **しかない** suggests that the described action is the sole remaining possibility due to specific circumstances. This often implies a sense of resignation or inevitability.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The casual abbreviation **っきゃない** is sometimes seen in manga, anime, and informal speech. While understandable, it's less common in everyday conversation.
  *  The nuance of **しかない** is stronger than **だけ**, highlighting the lack of alternatives.
