writeup: The conjunction **それに** is used to add more information to a previous statement. Think of it
  as adding a point that aligns with the previous one in terms of its overall feeling or context. While
  often translated as "and", "besides", "moreover", or "in addition", it's crucial to understand the nuance
  of **adding similar information**. It connects two pieces of information that share a positive or negative
  sentiment. Therefore, you would use **それに** to add a positive point to a previous positive point, or
  a negative point to a previous negative point. Mixing positive and negative statements with **それに**
  sounds unnatural.
