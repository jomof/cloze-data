  「の至り」 is a set, formal expression used to highlight that (A) is the highest level of something. It's often used positively, but not exclusively. It combines the case-marking particle 「の」 and the noun 「至り」, meaning "pinnacle" or "climax". Common translations include "the utmost (A)" or "the extreme of (A)". To use this structure, attach it to the end of a noun, where that noun represents the **limit** of what's being expressed. (A) is usually an emotion experienced intensely in certain situations, such as 「光栄」 "honor", 「赤面」 "embarrassment", 「感謝」 "gratefulness", or 「恐縮」 "obligation".

  **Important Note:** The set expression 「若気の至り」 is used to describe a blunder made due to youthful impulsiveness and lack of careful consideration. 「若気」 roughly translates to "youthful impetuousness".
