  「すぎる」 is a verb meaning "to exceed" or "to go past." When attached to other words, it conveys the idea of "too much." It can be connected to:

  *  The ます-stem of verbs (remove ます).
  *  The stem form of い-adjectives (remove い).
  *  The stem form of な-adjectives (remove な).

  The trailing 「る」 in 「すぎる」 is often omitted in casual speech, becoming just 「すぎ」. This shortened form maintains the same meaning and is commonly heard.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  When 「すぎる」 follows 「ない」, the 「い」 changes to 「さ」, forming 「なさすぎる」. This translates to "too much not (A)" or more naturally, "not enough (A)."
  *  Remember to use 「では」 or 「じゃ」 after な-adjectives before 「なさすぎる」.
  *  While omitting the 「さ」 in 「なさすぎる」 is grammatically incorrect, it's prevalent among younger speakers.
  *  When using 「すぎる」 with 「いい」 (good), the stem form is 「よ」, not 「い」. Therefore, "too good" is 「よすぎる」, not 「いすぎる」.

  **Pay attention to negation:** 「すぎる」 itself is a verb and can be negated. The placement of 「ない」 and the number of negations can significantly alter the meaning. Be mindful when interpreting sentences with multiple negations involving 「すぎる」.
examples:
  - japanese: 学校に**行かなさすぎる**から成績が落ちた。
    english: Because I don't go to school enough, my grades have dropped. (Literally, I don't go too much)

    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The 「かなさすぎる」 form indicates a state of not doing something excessively, resulting in 'not
      enough'.

      embarrassment or playful admission. The context and the use of 「ねえ」 makes it flirty.
  - japanese: アイスクリームを**食べすぎた**からお腹が痛い。
    english: My stomach hurts because I ate too much ice cream.

    conjugation: past (plain)
    register: casual

    nuance: 「面白く」 is the adverbial form of the い-adjective 「面白い」. 「なさすぎた」 emphasizes the extreme lack
      of funniness. The 「ね」 seeks agreement.

    english: I always sleep too much on the weekends.
    conjugation: polite (non-past)

    setting: casual

post_example_writeup: Remember that while the shortened form 「すぎ」 is very common in casual conversation,
  it's generally better to use the full 「すぎる」 in more formal settings. Also, be mindful of the nuances
  that arise when 「すぎる」 interacts with negative forms, as the meaning can shift significantly depending
  on the construction.
false_friends:
  - term: あまり
    meaning: So much...that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「すぎる」, 「あまり」 often implies a consequence or result due to the excess. It can also mean
      "not very" when used with a negative.
  - term: あまりに
    meaning: So much...that, (Way) too...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「あまり」, 「あまりに」 emphasizes the degree of excess, often leading to a particular outcome.
      It can be more emphatic than 「すぎる」.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「あまり」 and 「あまりに」 can sometimes be used in place of 「すぎる」 to express
  excess, they often carry a stronger sense of consequence or result. 「すぎる」 is a more direct way to state
  that something is "too much." Pay attention to the context to choose the most appropriate expression.
  「あまり」 also has the distinct usage of meaning "not very" with negatives, which 「すぎる」 does not share.
