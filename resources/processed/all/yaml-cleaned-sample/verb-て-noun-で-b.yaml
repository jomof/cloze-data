writeup: The conjunctive particle **て** (te), or the case marking particle **で** (de) are often used to
  highlight when something is being 'used'. The thing being used does not necessarily need to indicate
  a tool, but can also indicate a circumstance or situation. In these cases, '(A)で(B)' translates as "with/by
  means of (A), (B)". With **て** and **で**, the nuance is quite often that (A) allowed or led to (B).
  This may be a simple sequence of events or may be through the direct use of a tool or situation. The
  specific nuance being highlighted will always depend on the (B) phrase. Due to this, it is **important**
  to always read the (B) clause before deciding what the speaker is trying to convey.

false_friends:
  - term: で (at)
    meaning: At (a location); In (a place); On (a platform)
    kind: particle
    nuance: Unlike Verb[て]・Noun[で] + B, the particle で (de) indicating location specifies *where* an action
      occurs, not *by what means* it is performed.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that when で indicates location, it directly follows
  the place where the action happens. When で or て indicates means or manner, it describes *how* something
  is done or *what* is used to do it.
