writeup: 「とか」 is a particle used to list examples in a non-exhaustive way, similar to saying "such as"
  or "among other things" in English. When listing multiple items, 「とか」 is placed after each item except
  sometimes the last one. It can be used with nouns and verb phrases. **Importantly**, using 「とか」 implies
  that there are other unmentioned items in the same category. Think of it as giving a few representative
  examples rather than a complete list. For example, saying 「りんごとかみかんとか」 suggests that apples and oranges
  are just a couple of fruits you have in mind, and there might be others.

  context to understand the full range of possibilities implied by the use of 「とか」.
false_friends:
  - term: やら～やら
    meaning: Whether or, Things like, And … so on
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「とか～とか」, 「やら～やら」 lists non-exhaustive examples, but often implies a sense of disorder
      or abundance, sometimes with a nuance of being overwhelmed by the variety.
  - term: たり～たりする
    meaning: Things like ~ and ~
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「たり～たりする」 is used for listing actions, often implying a sequence or alternation of activities,
      whereas 「とか～とか」 can list nouns or actions without this sequential implication.
  - term: や
    meaning: Things like, And the like
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Like 「とか」, 「や」 lists examples, but it's generally used for nouns only and can sometimes sound
      less formal than 「とか」. Unlike 「とか」, 「や」 cannot directly connect verb phrases.
  - term: など
    meaning: Such as, Things like, Etc., And so on
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「など」 is often placed at the end of a list of nouns to indicate "etc." or "and so on". While
      similar in meaning to 「とか」, it's usually placed after the listed items, not between them.
  - term: といった
    meaning: Such as, Like, So much as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「といった」 is a more formal way of saying "such as" and is often used to provide examples in a
      more structured manner, often followed by a noun or phrase summarizing the category.
  - term: たとえば
    meaning: For example
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「たとえば」 explicitly means "for example" and introduces a specific instance. While it serves
      a similar purpose to 「とか」 in providing an example, it doesn't inherently imply a non-exhaustive
      list in the same way.
  - term: し～し
    meaning: And, Giving reasons
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「し～し」 is used to list reasons or facts, connecting clauses. While it can introduce examples,
      its primary function is to provide multiple reasons, unlike 「とか～とか」 which focuses on listing examples
      within a category.
  - term: なんか・なんて
    meaning: Such as, Things like, Emphasis
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「なんか」 and 「なんて」 can be used to list examples informally, often with a self-deprecating or
      casual tone. They can also add emphasis or express surprise, which 「とか」 doesn't usually do.
  - term: ～なり～なり
    meaning: Or, Either or
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「～なり～なり」 presents two or more options for the listener to choose from, implying exclusivity
      between the options. 「とか～とか」, on the other hand, lists examples within a category without the sense
      of choosing between them.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「とか～とか」 is your go-to for listing non-exhaustive
  examples of things or actions. If you want to emphasize a sense of being overwhelmed, 「やら～やら」 might
  be more fitting. For listing a sequence of actions, use 「たり～たりする」. If you're listing nouns and want
  a less formal feel, 「や」 works. For a more formal approach to introducing examples, consider 「といった」.
  「たとえば」 is a direct way to say "for example." If you're providing reasons, 「し～し」 is appropriate. For
  informal examples with a touch of emphasis, 「なんか」 or 「なんて」 could work. Finally, when presenting a choice,
  use 「～なり～なり」.
