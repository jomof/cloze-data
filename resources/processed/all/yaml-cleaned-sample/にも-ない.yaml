writeup: |-
  When combined with the auxiliary verbs of volition, **う** or **よう**, **にも～ない** conveys that "despite wanting to (A), it can't be done". There are usually some circumstances as to why (A) cannot be done that are beyond the control of the speaker. The same verb will be repeated in both the volitional form and the negated potential form. This means that the literal meaning of this grammar pattern is "Even if I went to (A), I can't (A)". This "went to" implies the "attempt" or "will" on behalf of the speaker.

  **Caution:** As opposed to the similar **に～ない** grammar point that pairs with verbs in dictionary form, **ようにも～ない** tends to refer more to physical reasons for why something cannot be done. **に～ない** on the other hand is often used to illustrate mental limitations.

post_example_writeup: The grammar point にも～ない highlights a situation where one's will or attempt to do
  something is thwarted by external circumstances or limitations. It emphasizes the speaker's desire or
  effort, even though the action is ultimately impossible.
false_friends:
  - term: どんなに〜ても
    meaning: No matter how
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike にも～ない, どんなに〜ても focuses on the degree of effort or extent of something, rather than
      the inability to perform an action despite wanting to. While both can express limitations, どんなに〜ても
      emphasizes the intensity of the attempt, whereas にも～ない emphasizes the impossibility of the outcome.
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To avoid confusion, remember that にも～ない specifically indicates the inability
  to perform an action despite one''s will, often due to external factors. どんなに〜ても, on the other hand,
  emphasizes the extent or degree, suggesting that even with significant effort, the outcome might still
  be unsatisfactory or unchanged. The core difference lies in the focus: impossibility of action versus
  intensity of effort.'
