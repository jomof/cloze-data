  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
writeup: While 中に highlights that something is in the process of happening when referring to events or
  actions, **最中に emphasizes being right in the middle of that process**. The kanji 最 (sai) means "utmost,"
  so literally, it means "utmost middle." This is similar to English phrases like "at the height of" or
  "in the midst of." When using 最中に, the (B) part of the sentence typically describes something that interrupts
  or disturbs the ongoing action (A). 最中に attaches to the ている form of a verb or a noun followed by の.
  While less common, 最中 can sometimes be used with adjectives to indicate being at the pinnacle of a feeling
  or emotion.

  same emphasis on being in the thick of it. の間に and うに focus on a broader timeframe or a period before
  a change, respectively.
