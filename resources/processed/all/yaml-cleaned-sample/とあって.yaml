writeup: とあって is a formal grammar expression that combines the case marking particle と with the て-form
  of ある "to be". It is used to present an unusual or noteworthy situation (A) from which an obvious or
  natural result (B) will or has occurred. It is often translated as "since (A), it is no wonder that
  (B)", or "because of (A), it's natural that (B)". とあって is usually seen following nouns, verbs, and i-adjectives
  in their standard plain forms. な-Adjectives require a だ between them and とあって. This construction is
  similar in nuance to ので or から, but carries a stronger sense of natural consequence due to the special
  circumstance described by A. It can be thought of as similar to として "as", but focuses more on 'what
  (A) is or is viewed as', emphasized through ある, rather than 'how (A) conducts itself or is conducted',
  emphasized through する. **Important Consideration:** とあって is used to state objective facts and will not
  refer to the speaker or writer's own circumstances or feelings.
