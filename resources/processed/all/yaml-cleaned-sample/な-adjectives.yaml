  In Japanese, **な-Adjectives** (形容動詞 - *keiyō dōshi*) function as both adjectives and nouns. Their dictionary form ends in だ. The particle な is used to connect them to a noun they modify. For example, 綺麗だ (*kirei da*) means "is pretty" or "beautiful," while 綺麗な花 (*kirei na hana*) means "a pretty flower."

  **Key characteristics of な-Adjectives:**

  *  They act like nouns when they are the subject or object of a sentence.
  *  They act like adjectives when modifying nouns, using な between the adjective and the noun.
  *  They conjugate with です (*desu*) and other polite forms like nouns.
  *  Many な-Adjectives have origins in Chinese or other foreign languages.

  **Identifying な-Adjectives:**

  A helpful tip for learners, especially since some な-Adjectives end in い (like 綺麗 - *kirei*), is to use the adverb **とても** (*totemo* - very). If a word sounds natural with *totemo*, it's likely a な-Adjective. For example, 「とても綺麗」 (*totemo kirei* - very pretty) sounds natural. However, 「とても外」 (*totemo soto* - very outside) sounds unnatural because 外 (*soto*) is a regular noun.

  - term: い-Adjectives
    meaning: Adjectives ending in い
    kind: similar
    nuance: Unlike な-Adjectives, い-Adjectives conjugate by changing the い ending. They don't require な
      to modify a noun (e.g., 高い山 - *takai yama* - a tall mountain).
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that な-Adjectives connect to nouns with な, while
  い-Adjectives connect directly to nouns. Also, their conjugation patterns are distinct. な-Adjectives
  use forms of だ/です, whereas い-Adjectives change their い ending.
