  **すると** is a conjunction that indicates a natural consequence or a discovery following a certain action or situation. Think of it as meaning "and then," "upon doing that," or "if that's the case, then." It often appears at the beginning of a new sentence, connecting it to the preceding statement.

  **Key Points:**

  *  It signifies that event B happens immediately or naturally after event A.
  *  The result indicated by **すると** is often something outside of the speaker's direct control or a logical deduction based on the prior statement.
  *  When used to respond to someone else's statement, it can express a confirmation or deduction, similar to saying "So you mean...?" or "If that's the case...?"

    meaning: If, When, Whenever, And, [Conditional]
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While **と** can also indicate a sequence of events, it often carries a stronger sense of conditionality

      a more natural or consequential outcome without explicitly stating the reason.'
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion with similar expressions, remember that **すると** highlights
  a natural or consequential follow-up. It's about what happens *as a result* or *upon* something else,
  often with an element of surprise or discovery. Expressions like **そこで** involve more intentional actions,
  while **それに** is for adding information. Think of **すると** as bridging a situation to its immediate or
  natural outcome.
