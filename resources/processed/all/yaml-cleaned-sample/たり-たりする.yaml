  The 「たり」 form is used to list non-exhaustive actions or states, indicating "things like" or "among other things." It connects verbs in the past tense plain form. The final verb in the sequence is often 「する」 (or its conjugations like 「した」 for the past tense). This grammar point suggests that the listed actions are just a few examples, and the order in which they are mentioned is not necessarily the order in which they occur. Sometimes, 「たり」 can become 「だり」 after verbs that form their past tense with 「だ」 (e.g., 読む→読んだり). This is a phonetic change and doesn't alter the meaning.

  **Key Difference from て-form:** While the て-form can also list actions, it often implies a sequence or a cause-and-effect relationship. 「たり～たりする」, on the other hand, emphasizes a variety of actions without a specific order or consequence.

  **Usage with Single Verb:** It's common to use 「たりする」 with only one verb, implying that the speaker does "things like" that verb, without specifying other examples.

  **Important Consideration:** When the last verb in a 「たり」 sequence is a する verb, the 「たり」 is often omitted.
