  「**まえに**」 is used to indicate something that is either **before something else in time** or **located in front of something else**.

  *  When indicating a time **before** an action, use the **dictionary form of a verb** directly before 「まえに」.
  *  When indicating a location **in front of** something, use a **noun followed by 「の」** and then 「まえに」.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Be careful not to confuse 「まえに」 with 「てまえに」. While both can mean "in front of," 「てまえに」 is used to describe something **directly in front of oneself or someone/something else** in a physical sense. 「まえに」 has a broader usage for things in front of a location generally.
  *  Remember that 「まえに」 can also mean "ago" when used with a time duration (e.g., ３年前に - three years ago). This grammar point focuses on its use as "before" or "in front of."

  location. When used with verbs to indicate time, the verb should be in its dictionary form.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「あとで」 is the direct opposite of 「まえに」 in
  terms of time. 「手前」 is more specific to the immediate space in front of something or someone. 「ないうちに」
  has a nuance of urgency or opportunity before a change occurs. 「前者」 and 「後者」 are used for comparing
  two previously mentioned items, where 「前者」 indicates the one that came first in the discussion, not
  necessarily in time or space in the same way as 「まえに」.
