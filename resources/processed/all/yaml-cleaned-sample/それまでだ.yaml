writeup: 「それまでだ」 is a phrase used to express that if a certain undesirable outcome occurs, then everything
  leading up to that point becomes meaningless or futile. It conveys a sense of **finality** and the **wasted
  effort** if a crucial condition isn't met. The structure is often used with a conditional clause using
  「ば」 form, indicating "if (this happens), then it's all over". While 「ば」 is the most common, 「たら」 can
  also be used, although less frequently. You'll often see it in sentences where the first part includes
  「ても」 or 「でも」, highlighting that even despite some effort or circumstance, a particular negative outcome
  renders it pointless. A set phrase to remember is 「と言われればそれまでだ」, which means something like "well, if
  you put it that way, then that's that," often used to concede a point or express a mild disagreement
  while acknowledging the validity of another's perspective.
examples:
  - japanese: このことが外部に漏れればそれまでだ。
    english: If this information gets leaked, then it's all in vain.
    register: standard
    setting: serious
    nuance: The sentence uses 「漏れれば」, the conditional ば-form of the verb 「漏れる」 (to leak), to express the
      condition that would make everything pointless.
  - japanese: やっとここまでたどり着いた。ここでミスを犯せばそれまでだ。
    english: We finally got to this point. If we make a mistake then it's all in vain.
    register: standard
    setting: cautious
    nuance: 「たどり着いた」 means 'reached', emphasizing the effort to get to this point. 「犯せば」 is the conditional
      ば-form of 「犯す」 (to commit), highlighting the fragility of their current position.
  - japanese: もう少し我慢をしろ！ここで見つかったらそれまでだ。
    english: Have a little more patience! If they find you here, that's it.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    nuance: 「しろ！」 is a casual imperative, showing a degree of urgency. 「見つかったら」 uses the たら-form, which
      is also acceptable but slightly less common than the ば-form here.
  - japanese: 彼らに訴えられたらそれまでだ。
    english: If they sue us, that's it.
    register: standard
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「訴えられたら」 is the passive conditional form of 「訴える」 (to sue), indicating the undesirable action
      being done to them.
  - japanese: 不可能だと言われればそれまでだ。せめて一回でもいいから試してみよう。
    english: If you say it's impossible, that's the end of the story. Let's at least give it a try, even
      if it's just once.
    register: standard
    setting: persuasive
    nuance: The first part, 「不可能だと言われればそれまでだ」, uses the set phrase to acknowledge the other person's stance.
      The second part, 「試してみよう」, is a suggestion, showing a desire to overcome the stated impossibility.
  - japanese: A:「毎日毎日勉強していてとても疲れてるんだ。。大学を中退したい。。。」B:「でも、もう３年生だよ！あきらめてしまったらそれまでだよ。」
    english: 'A: ''I''m studying every single day, I am so tired. I want to drop out of college...'' B:
      ''But you''re already in your third year! If you give up then it''s all in vain.'''
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Speaker B uses 「あきらめてしまったら」, the たら-form emphasizing the consequence of giving up after investing
      significant time (being a third-year student). The 「だよ」 at the end adds a gentle, emphatic tone.
  - japanese: どんなに大きな家でも、誰も住まなければそれまでだ。
    english: No matter how big the house is, if no one lives there then it's all in vain.
    register: standard
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The 「どんなに〜ても」 structure (no matter how~) sets up a contrast, highlighting that even with a
      positive attribute (a big house), a lack of a crucial element (someone living there) renders it
      meaningless. 「住まなければ」 is the negative conditional form of 「住む」 (to live).
  - japanese: この内定を受諾することに興味がないだけと言えばそれまでだが、もういちどよく考えて決めたほうがいいだろうな。こんなチャンスは二度とないよ。
    english: If you say that you are not interested in accepting this offer then there is no point (in
      discussing further), but I think you'd better think it over once again and then decide. You won't
      get a second chance like this.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: persuasive
    nuance: This sentence uses the 「と言えばそれまでだ」 construction to initially acknowledge the listener's potential
      disinterest. The use of 「〜たほうがいいだろうな」 conveys a strong suggestion. The phrase 「二度とないよ」 emphasizes
      the rarity of the opportunity.
  - japanese: ダイエットしている友達へ:「頑張って運動しても毎日食べ過ぎたらそれまでだよ。」
    english: 'To a friend who is dieting: ''Even if you do your best exercising, if you eat too much every
      day then it''s all in vain.'''
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「ても」 in 「頑張って運動しても」 highlights that even with effort, the subsequent action 「食べ過ぎたら」
      negates it. The 「だよ」 adds a friendly, slightly admonishing tone.
  - japanese: スパイ映画:「敵に発見されたらそれまでだ。」
    english: 'Spy movie: ''If we are discovered then it''s all in vain.'''
    register: standard
    setting: serious
    nuance: This is a classic scenario where discovery means the mission fails, making all prior efforts
      pointless. 「発見されたら」 is the passive conditional form of 「発見する」 (to discover).
