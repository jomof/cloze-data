writeup: The grammar point 「ために」 expresses **cause or reason**, similar to "because of" or "due to" in
  English. 「ため」 itself is a noun meaning "sake" or "purpose." When combined with the particle 「に」, it
  indicates the reason **why** something occurred. While it can also express purpose (as in "in order
  to"), when used with verbs in the past tense or with nouns describing a situation, 「ために」 typically emphasizes
  the **result** of a prior event or state. Think of it as highlighting the factor that **led to** a particular
  outcome. You can attach 「ために」 to the past tense of verbs, nouns followed by 「の」, or い-adjectives and
  な-adjectives in their attributive form.
