writeup: |-
  だけのことはある is a grammar structure used to express that something is **not surprising** or **as expected**. It implies that there's a good reason why something turned out the way it did. The structure combines the particle だけ (only; just), the possessive particle の, the noun こと (thing; matter), the topic marker は, and the verb ある (to be; to exist). Literally, it can be interpreted as "there is a matter of just that," suggesting that the preceding reason is sufficient to explain the outcome.

  This grammar point often appears with adverbs like さすが (as one would expect), やはり (as expected; after all), or やっぱり (as expected; sure enough), which further emphasize the feeling of inevitability or natural consequence.

  だけのことはある can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns. When used with な-adjectives, the な must be included. With nouns and な-adjectives, you might also see だっただけのことはある, emphasizing a past reason for the current, expected outcome.

  **Important Consideration:** Remember that だけのことはある is only used for **positive or expected outcomes**. It cannot be used to express surprise or a natural consequence for negative situations.

  it's important to consider the specific nuance each conveys. だけのことはある specifically highlights that a
  positive outcome or quality is not surprising due to preceding factors like effort, training, or inherent
  talent. When choosing between these expressions, consider whether the focus is on explaining the reason
  (わけだ), emphasizing a cause (だけあって), adding extra emphasis (だけに), or highlighting the expected positive
  result (だけのことはある).
