  **まま** (mama), written with the kanji **儘**, signifies a state of being "as it is" or "unchanged". It functions as a noun that describes something remaining in its original condition. This grammar point can be translated as "while remaining (A)", "as (A) is", or "left in the state of (A)". It attaches directly to nouns. When used with verbs, it typically follows the **た-form** (past tense), emphasizing that an action has been completed and its state remains. まま often implies that something is deliberately left alone or undisturbed, which is frequently seen with verbs in the **ない-form**.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The particle **に** following まま is often omitted but adds emphasis to the subsequent verb.
  *  The colloquial form **まんま** is used in casual speech and writing to mimic casual conversation.

      as is, which is not necessarily the case with 「ままに」.
  - term: きり
    meaning: Only, Just, Since
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「きり」 can sometimes describe a remaining state (e.g., 'that's all there is'), it primarily
      focuses on limitation or a point in time, unlike 「ままに」 which emphasizes the continuation of a state.
  - term: たなり・なり
    meaning: While... ~ing, Remaining, Not or ever since, Keep or leave

    meaning: Like, Similar to, As if, The same as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「如く・如き・如し」 are more formal and literary expressions for comparison, whereas 「ままに」 describes
      an unchanged state.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that ままに describes a state of being unchanged.
  While some expressions like てある and っぱなし might seem similar, they carry additional nuances related to
  intentionality or negligence. きり focuses on limitation, and the passive form with ままに relates to following
  instructions. 如く and its variations are for making comparisons, unlike ままに which focuses on the continuation
  of a state.
