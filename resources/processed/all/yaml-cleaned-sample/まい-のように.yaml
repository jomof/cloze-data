writeup: |-
  Similar to **ように**, まい～のように indicates that something happens “in the manner/way of (A).” **まい** (from the kanji **毎**) means "every" and is always followed by a word (A) expressing a unit of measurement, typically time. まい～のように is often translated as "almost every (A)," "nearly every (A)," or "on an (A) basis."

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While **よう** (from 様) usually describes the "manner" in which something exists or happens, this phrase literally emphasizes that something occurs "in the manner of every (A)." The nuance of "almost" or "nearly" is often implied but can depend on context.
  *  Although **みたいに** and **のように** are often interchangeable, this is **not** the case with まい～のように. **みたいだ** is an abbreviation of the more formal phrase **を見たような** and can sound unnatural when describing abstract concepts like time.

  of something happening frequently, close to 'every', while the other expressions have slightly different

  specifies intervals, and 「につき」 often indicates reason or per-unit cost. Using 「ように」 alone simply creates
  a comparison.
