etymology: 「てから」 is formed by combining the て-form of a verb with 「から」, which literally means 'from'.
  This combination signifies that the subsequent action begins or occurs after the completion of the initial
  action.
writeup: '「てから」 is used to indicate that one action follows another. It emphasizes the **sequential relationship**
  between two events, with the second action occurring only **after** the first is completed. Think of
  it as establishing a clear order: first A happens, *then* B happens. The basic structure is: **Verb
  (て-form) + から + Clause**. It''s often translated as "after doing..." or "once...is done". While 「から」
  on its own can mean "because", when attached to the て-form of a verb, it specifically denotes a temporal
  sequence.'

    english: After watching the movie, why don't we grab some tea or something?
    register: casual

      often used in flirting.

post_example_writeup: It's important to note that 「てから」 implies a **completed** action in the first clause
  before the second action can begin. This distinguishes it from other expressions that might simply indicate
  a sequence of events without this emphasis on completion.
false_friends:
  - term: あとで
    meaning: After, Later
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「てから」, 「あとで」 simply indicates a time difference without necessarily implying that the
      first action needs to be completed before the second can begin. It's a more general term for 'later'.
  - term: たら
    meaning: When, From when, Just when, If
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「てから」, 「たら」 has multiple meanings including 'when' or 'if', and doesn't specifically
      emphasize the completion of the first action. It focuses more on the timing or condition of the
      second action.
  - term: 上で
    meaning: After, Upon
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「てから」 which is a very common, basic grammar point, 「上で」 is more formal and suggests
      that the first action provides a basis or condition for the second action. It's often used in more
      formal or written contexts.
  - term: から (because)
    meaning: From
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「てから」 indicates a temporal sequence, 「から」 alone indicates a reason or cause. Be mindful
      of the verb form preceding 「から」 to distinguish between these meanings.
  - term: て初めて
    meaning: For the first time, Not until, Only after, Only when, Only because
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「てから」 which simply states a sequence, 「て初めて」 emphasizes that the second action happens
      *because* of the first action and often implies a realization or new understanding.
  - term: Verb + て
    meaning: And, Then (Linking events)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「Verb + て」 can link events sequentially, it doesn't carry the same emphasis on the completion
      of the first action as a prerequisite for the second action like 「てから」 does. 「Verb + て」 is a more
      general way to connect actions.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「てから」 clearly states that one thing needs
  to finish before the next one starts. If you want to simply say one thing happens after another in a
  general sense, or if the relationship is causal rather than strictly temporal, other expressions like
  「あとで」 or 「から」 might be more appropriate. Pay close attention to the nuance you want to convey.
