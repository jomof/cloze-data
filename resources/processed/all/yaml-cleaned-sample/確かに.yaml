writeup: |-
  **確かに (tashika ni)** functions as an adverb meaning "surely" or "certainly." It's derived from the な-adjective **確か (tashika)**, which means "certain" or "sure." You can use 確かに when you want to emphasize that something is definitely the case. It affirms the truth of a statement.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While 確かに translates to "certainly," be careful not to use it in situations where you are granting permission. In English, "certainly" can be used to say "yes" or give permission, but 確かに does not carry this nuance.
  *  Without the **に**, **確か (tashika)** is often used to express uncertainty or a reminder, similar to "if I remember correctly," "if I'm not mistaken," or "now that you mention it."
