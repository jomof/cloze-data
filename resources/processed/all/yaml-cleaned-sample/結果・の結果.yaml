  **結果 (kekka)** means "result" in Japanese. The grammar point **結果・の結果 (kekka no kekka)** translates to "as a result of." You'll often see it used in two main ways:

  *  **Verb (past tense) + 結果:** This pattern is used when the result is a direct consequence of an action. For example, 「飲酒運転をした結果、事故を起こした (inshu unten o shita kekka, jiko o okoshita)」 means "As a result of drinking and driving, I caused an accident."
  *  **Noun + の + 結果:** This pattern connects a noun with its resulting outcome. For example, 「話し合いの結果、合意に達しました (hanashiai no kekka, goui ni tasshimashita)」 means "As a result of the discussion, we reached an agreement."

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Unlike **あげく (ageku)**, which typically indicates a negative outcome, **結果 (kekka)** can be used for both positive and negative results.
  *  **その結果 (sono kekka)** is a similar expression that also means "as a result," but it often refers back to a previously mentioned event or situation.

    meaning: As a result

    nuance: While 「その結果」 also means "as a result," it often refers back to a previously mentioned situation
      or event. 「結果・の結果」 can be used more broadly to introduce a consequence.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「その結果」 usually follows a statement that
  provides context, whereas 「結果・の結果」 directly links a cause and effect. Also, be mindful of the connotation;
  if the outcome is negative, 「あげく」 might be more appropriate than 「結果・の結果」.
