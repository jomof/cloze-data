writeup: |-
  The combination of the particle て and は, forming ては, creates a structure used to express conditions or reasons, often with a sense of negative consequence or judgment. It can be interpreted as "if (A), then (B) is likely to happen (often something undesirable)", "because of (A), (B) happens", or "with (A), (B) is the result". When used to express a conditional "if", ては often implies a negative outcome or a critical assessment of the situation.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  When the preceding element is a noun or a な-adjective, or a verb that typically connects with で in the て-form, では is used instead of ては. For example, 静か**では**集中できない (If it is quiet, I cannot concentrate).
  *  Like other ては/では structures, it can be informally shortened to ちゃ or じゃ.

  their nuances differ. 「たって」 highlights the invariance of an outcome despite a condition. 「ようでは/ようじゃ」

  an action and its consequences. Understanding these subtle differences is key to using them correctly.
