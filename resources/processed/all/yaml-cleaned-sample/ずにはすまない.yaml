writeup: |-
  「ずにはすまない」 is used to indicate that one **has no choice but to (A)**, or **won't get away without doing (A)**. It is a **formal** expression. It combines the negative classical auxiliary verb, 「ず」, the case-marking particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the standard negated form of the う-verb 「済む」 meaning “to come to pass” or “to finish”. A more literal, though less natural, translation is “it will not come to pass that (A) is not done”. The more natural English interpretations convey the same feeling of obligation or inevitability.

  As indicated by 「ず」, this grammar point follows verbs. Similar to other instances where 「ず」 is used with 「する」, the correct conjugation will be 「ぜず」.

  The standard negative form of a verb (ない-form) may also be followed by 「ではすまない」. This has the same meaning as 「ずにはすまない」.

  **Important Considerations:**

  This construction can sound unnatural when the speaker's feeling of necessity is solely based on personal feelings. Typically, (A) represents an action that would be expected by anyone in the situation.
