writeup: 「でしかない」 is a grammatical construction used to express that something is **no more than** or **merely**
  what is stated. It combines the conjunctive form of だ (で), the particle しか, and the い-adjective ない.
  It emphasizes the limited or insignificant nature of the preceding noun. While it can have a neutral
  tone, it often carries a slightly **negative connotation**, suggesting that something lacks value or
  is disappointing because it's 'just' something.
