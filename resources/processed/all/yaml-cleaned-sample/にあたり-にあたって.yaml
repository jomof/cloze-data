  にあたり or にあたって is a formal grammar pattern in Japanese used to convey the meaning of "at the time of (A)," "when doing (A)," or "on the occasion of (A)." Similar to に際して "on the occasion of (A)," it is often used when preparing for future events. This structure combines に with the u-verb 当たる "to hit" or "to come into contact," appearing either in its formal-conjunctive form (にあたり) or its て-form (にあたって). にあたり follows verbs in their dictionary form or nouns. There are two primary nuances for this structure:

  *  When (A) is a **special occasion or condition** preceding action (B).
  *  When (A) is a **goal or target**, and (B) represents the means or measures taken in response.

  **Important Consideration:** Unlike に際して, which can be used for both positive and negative situations, にあたり is primarily used for positive or neutral situations.
