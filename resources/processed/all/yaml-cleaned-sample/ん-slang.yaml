  Being the shortest sound in the Japanese language, ん is often used for abbreviation, especially in casual speech. Abbreviation with ん occurs primarily to make part (A) and part (B) of a statement flow together more smoothly.

  In general, ん will only replace sounds that require rolling of the tongue, which are the ら, り, る, れ, ろ sounds.

  **Common Uses:**

  *  **Replacing the ら negative stem:** Used with verbs where る changes to ら in the negative form (e.g., 分からない → 分かんない). This also applies to other words ending in らない, like the い-adjective つまらない (つまんない).
  *  **Replacing the entire いる in the ている form:** Used to shorten the progressive form of verbs (e.g., 走っている → 走ってる → 走んない - less common for this particular verb but structurally possible).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The abbreviation with ん is always followed by another part of the sentence. It doesn't typically end a sentence when used in this abbreviating way. The purpose is to connect two parts of a statement.

  **Fun Fact:**

  If a sentence ends in ん and the negative stem hasn't been removed, it's usually an abbreviation of the classical auxiliary verb ぬ, which functions similarly to modern ない. This usage of ん often conveys a forceful tone, like saying "won't (A)" or "don't (A)."

  Remember that する changes to せん, not しん, when using the classical ぬ form.
etymology: The use of ん as an abbreviation stems from the simplification of sounds, particularly replacing
  the 'r' sounds in the negative forms. It's a natural evolution in casual speech for easier pronunciation
  and flow.
examples:
  - japanese: 俺は何も知らん。
    english: I wouldn't have a clue.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「俺」 is a masculine pronoun, indicating the speaker is male. The use of 「〜ん」 instead of 「〜らない」
      is very casual and common in male speech.
  - japanese: もう一生走らん。
    english: I will never run again.

    english: That guy doesn't understand Japanese.

      tone. The speaker is feigning disappointment in a flirtatious way.
post_example_writeup: Remember that while ん can replace the 'r' sounds in negative verb endings and words
  ending in らない, it doesn't apply to all negative forms. For example, you wouldn't say *食べん for 食べない.
