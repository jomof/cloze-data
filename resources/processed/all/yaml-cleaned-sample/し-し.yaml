  Like て, し is a conjunction particle. This means that it is used for linking the (A) and (B) parts of a sentence, describing that link as 'reasons'. It's often translated simply as "and." し can be connected to the end of almost any word, but requires だ before it when following nouns or な-adjectives. し follows each 'reason' listed in a sentence. The final し can be replaced with から or ので before stating the 'result'. Using し implies that each listed 'reason' has equal weight or importance. Therefore, it's not appropriate when one reason significantly outweighs others.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  All reasons connected by し should be of comparable significance within the context.
  *  While the final し can be replaced by から or ので, this subtly shifts the focus towards a more explicit cause-and-effect relationship for the final reason.

post_example_writeup: Remember that while the last し can be replaced with から or ので, doing so emphasizes
  the causal relationship of that final reason more strongly than when using し. Using し throughout implies
  a more equal weighting of the listed reasons.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「し～し」 is best used when listing multiple
  reasons of roughly equal importance. If you want to emphasize a cause-and-effect relationship, especially
  for the final reason, consider using から or ので. 「とか～とか」 is useful for providing examples, while 「上に」
  often adds a supplementary point. The て-form conjunctions usually link actions or states with their
  direct consequences.
