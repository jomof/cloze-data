writeup: |-
  だす, or 出す in its kanji form, is a verb that is regularly attached to the conjunctive form (masu-stem) of other verbs. When connected this way, it means "to suddenly do (A)" or "to burst into (A)." To use this construction, simply add だす to the ます-stem of the verb you want to emphasize as happening 'suddenly.'

  **Important Consideration:**

  Unlike はじめる, another common structure meaning "to begin," だす often implies an unintentional action or something the subject can't control. On the other hand, はじめる expresses the subject's direct intention to do (A).

  the nuance of suddenness or spontaneity, often implying a lack of prior intention or control. はじめる,
  on the other hand, generally implies a planned or intentional start.
false_friends:

  - term: はじめる
    meaning: To start, To begin to

    nuance: While both indicate starting, はじめる generally implies intention, whereas だす emphasizes suddenness
      or lack of control.
  - term: いきなり
    meaning: For no reason, Suddenly, All of a sudden
    kind: adverb
    nuance: いきなり is an adverb describing the suddenness of an action, while だす is a verb suffix indicating
      the sudden start of an action.
  - term: かけ
    meaning: Half-, Not yet finished, About to, Begin to
    kind: suffix
    nuance: ～かけ implies an action has started but is not yet complete or is about to begin, whereas ～だす
      specifically emphasizes the sudden commencement of an action.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that だす is always attached to a verb and indicates
  the sudden start of that specific action. いきなり can be used independently to describe the suddenness
  of any event. はじめる focuses on the initiation of an action, often with intention, and ～かけ indicates an
  action in progress or about to start.
