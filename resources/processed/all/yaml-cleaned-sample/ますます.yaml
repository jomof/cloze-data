writeup: |-
  The adverb ますます means "increasingly," "more and more," or "to keep (A)ing." It emphasizes a continuous trend and is often placed at the beginning of a sentence. Sometimes, you might see it written in kanji as 益々, but the meaning remains exactly the same. The kanji 益 simply means "gain."

  **Fun Fact:** Although sometimes written as 益々, the origin of this expression lies in the stacking of the verb 増す (masu), a う-verb meaning "to increase." Because of this origin, ますます is most commonly used with verbs that indicate change or with adjectives that can increase in intensity.

  **Important Considerations:** While ますます is sometimes translated as "less and less," this usage still conveys the idea of something *increasing* in its negative aspect (i.e., increasingly negative).

    meaning: Even more or further, Again, More and more

      state, whereas ますます emphasizes a continuous progression.

      suggested by ますます.
  - term: ば〜ほど
    meaning: The more…the more

    kind: synonym
    nuance: 一方だ emphasizes that the change is happening in one direction without any signs of stopping

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that ますます emphasizes a continuous trend of increase
  or decrease. While other words express similar ideas, they often have subtle differences in nuance.
  更に suggests an addition, どんどん implies rapid change, 「ば〜ほど」 shows a proportional relationship, and 一方だ
  highlights an unstoppable, one-directional change.
