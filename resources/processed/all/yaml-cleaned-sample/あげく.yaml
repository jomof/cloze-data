writeup: |-
  **挙句 (ageku)**, meaning "in the end," is a noun used to express a negative or undesirable outcome that occurs after a considerable amount of time, effort, or a series of actions. It emphasizes that despite the preceding events, the final result was unfavorable. Think of it as the culmination of a process, often with a sigh of disappointment or frustration.

  あげく typically follows the past tense form of a verb or a noun followed by の. It highlights the contrast between the effort or events leading up to the conclusion and the often disappointing final result.

  You'll often see あげく written in hiragana, though the kanji forms 挙句 and 挙げ句 are also commonly used.

  **Etymology**: Interestingly, 挙句 originally referred to the final line of a **連歌 (renga)**, a form of early Japanese collaborative poetry. It literally means "the concluding phrase" or "the tying up phrase."
