  **はもちろん** (wa mochiron), or occasionally **は勿論**, is a Japanese grammar point used to express that something is a given or obvious, and then to introduce another related point. Think of it as saying "of course X is true, and also Y is true."

  The structure is quite straightforward: **Noun A + はもちろん + [related information about B, often with も]**.

  Here's a breakdown:

  *  **(Noun A) は**: The particle **は** marks **Noun A** as the topic. This is the thing that is considered obvious or a given.
  *  **もちろん**: This adverb means "of course," "naturally," or "needless to say." It emphasizes the obviousness of **Noun A**.
  *  **(B, often with も)**: This part introduces the additional information or point **B**, which is often emphasized with the particle **も** (also).

  **Key Usage Points:**

  *  **Highlighting Similarities:** Often, **B** shares a similar characteristic with **A**, even if **A** is considered more basic or expected.
  *  **Emphasis:** While **A** is presented as obvious, the focus of the sentence is often on **B**, highlighting its relevance or importance.
  *  **Formality:** While generally standard, **はもちろん** can sound slightly more formal than expressions like **だけでなく**. In casual conversation, it can add a tone of emphasis.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While similar to **だけでなく**, **はもちろん** places more emphasis on the obviousness of the first item.
  *  The particle **も** is frequently used after the second item to emphasize the "also" aspect.
  *  Avoid overusing it in casual conversations as it can sound a bit stiff.

  of information. However, the subtle differences in nuance dictate which expression is most appropriate.
  To avoid confusion, remember that **はもちろん** specifically highlights the obviousness or given nature
  of the first item before introducing the second. Expressions like **だけでなく** and **ばかりでなく** focus more
  on simply adding information without this emphasis. Expressions like **に加えて** explicitly indicate an
  addition. Paying attention to this subtle difference in emphasis will help you choose the right phrase
  for your intended meaning.'
