writeup: ながらも is a combination of the conjunction particle ながら, and the adverbial particle も. Coming from
  the kanji 乍ら, with the meaning of "while", ながら almost always keeps this nuance. Because of this, ながらも
  can be translated as "even while (A), (B)", or "although (A), also (B)". ながらも usually expresses surprise
  at the coexistence of (A) and (B), and may be used after い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, nouns with 「である」
  implied, or the conjunctive form (連用形) of verbs. ながらも is used to highlight a thing that comes after
  the existing state of (A) "そのままで後に続く事". Due to this, ながらも may only be used with verbs that highlight
  states of existence (like feelings), rather than ongoing actions.
