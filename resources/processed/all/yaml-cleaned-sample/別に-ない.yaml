  When paired with ない (either the い-Adjective or the auxiliary verb), the adverb 別に 'separately' shifts slightly in meaning to that of 特に 'especially'. Consider these examples to grasp the nuance. This 'especially' aspect of 別に arises from negating 'separately'. The literal sense of 別に～ない is akin to '(A) cannot be separated/differentiated'. This conveys a feeling of 'maybe it is a little (A), maybe a lot (A), but in any case, it cannot definitively be said that it IS (A)'.

  **Important Consideration:** 別に is often used with わけではない, as both express a degree of uncertainty. However, it's crucial to note that it should not be paired with わけがない, as this would combine an expression of uncertainty with one of certainty, creating a contradictory statement.
examples:
  - japanese: 私は別に構わないけど、お父さんはそういうの気にするから、お父さんの前ではそういう事言わないでね。
    english: I don't really mind, but my dad cares a lot about things like that, so please don't say such
      things in front of him.

    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female

    english: It's not really painful. It just stings a little.
    conjugation: plain non-past

      suitable for casual conversation.
  - japanese: あなたの事は別に嫌いではないよ。ただあなたと何について話せばいいか分からないだけ。
    english: It's not that I don't like you at all. It's just that I don't know what to talk about with

    conjugation: plain non-past
    register: casual

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker is being indirect and somewhat shy, a common trait in early romantic interactions.

      explains the reason for the perceived distance.
  - japanese: パーティーってみんな言っているけど、別にそんなに大したものではないよ。
    english: Everyone is calling it a party, but it's not really that big of a deal.
    conjugation: plain non-past
    register: casual

      frame the statement in a casual, explanatory tone.

    english: It's not that I dislike cakes. I just don't want one right now.
    conjugation: plain non-past
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of 「～というわけではない」 along with 「別に」 emphasizes the nuance of 'not particularly' rather
      than a strong negation. The 「～だけ」 provides a simple explanation.

    english: I'm not really saying that Tom is bad.
    conjugation: plain non-past

      Tom is at fault. The 「～よ」 adds a touch of assertion.

    english: Even if the music is that loud, I don't particularly care.
    conjugation: plain non-past
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「気にしない」 is a straightforward way of saying 'I don't mind'. The speaker's gender is implied
      by the slightly more direct phrasing.
  - japanese: 別に自分が汗だらけになってもかまわないが、他の人の汗は嫌です。
    english: I don't particularly mind being drenched in sweat myself, but I don't like other people's
      sweat.
    conjugation: plain non-past
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    nuance: The contrast between not minding one's own sweat but disliking others' adds a touch of humor.
      「～が」 acts as a conjunction, highlighting the contrasting opinions.

    english: It's not that I don't really have a dream.
    conjugation: plain non-past
    register: casual
    setting: reflective

      a dream, even if it's not clearly defined or pursued. The 「～よ」 adds a touch of personal affirmation.
  - japanese: 別に楽しくないわけではない。少し疲れているだけだ。
    english: It's not like I'm not particularly having fun. I'm just a bit tired.
    conjugation: plain non-past
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker uses a double negative 「楽しくないわけではない」, softened by 「別に」, to convey that she is
      enjoying herself to some extent, reassuring the listener. The 「～だけだ」 at the end offers a simple
      explanation for her slightly subdued demeanor. This could be said by a girlfriend to her boyfriend
      to avoid hurting his feelings.
post_example_writeup: Remember that 別に～ない softens a negative statement. It's not a strong negation but
  rather implies a lack of particularity or a lower degree of something.

  - term: なかなか～ない

    kind: synonym
    nuance: なかなか～ない suggests that something is difficult or not easily achieved, whereas 別に～ない indicates

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, consider what you want to emphasize. If you want to say
  something isn't frequent or of large quantity, use あまり～ない. If you want to convey that you don't have
  a strong opinion or feeling about something, 別に～ない is more appropriate. なかなか～ない is best used when describing
  the difficulty of an action or situation.
