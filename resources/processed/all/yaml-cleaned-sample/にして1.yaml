writeup: |-
  When the case-marking particle に is combined with the て-form of する, it often carries the meaning of "at (A)," "over (A)," or "only when (A)." This nuance is used when (A) is something that is a fairly high level, or some point that would be considered a prime example for any given topic. にして may appear following counters or standard nouns.

  While にして marks (A) as some particular exemplar, what follows may either be something that is or is not considered befitting of that example. In this way, (B) generally describes something that either does or does not fulfill the expectations of (A), and perhaps why.

  It is common to see にして followed by grammar patterns such as ようやく "finally" or 初めて "only when." These function to emphasize にして even further as being a point from which something is achieved or attained.

  **Fun Fact:** Just like other structures that make use of the various conjugations of にする, にして indicates something that has been decided upon or is being accepted as a fact from which a new condition will arise or has arisen.
