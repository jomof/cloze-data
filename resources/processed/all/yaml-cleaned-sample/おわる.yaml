writeup: |-
  To express that actions are beginning or ending in Japanese, the verbs 始める (hajimeru - to commence) or 終わる (owaru - to end) are used. This lesson focuses on actions that are "ending." To say that (A) is ending/finishing, attach おわる to the ます-stem of almost any verb. Whether you use the hiragana form or the kanji form does not change the nuance.

  Because おわる is a verb itself, its tense can be changed to show that something will end, is ending, or has ended.

  **Important Consideration:**
  Unlike 始める, which uses the transitive form, 終わる typically uses the intransitive form of its transitive/intransitive pair. This is because most actions in Japanese are considered to "come to an end" naturally (intransitive) rather than forcefully (transitive). However, there are exceptions, and 終える (oeru - the transitive version) may also be used as an auxiliary verb.

  - term: はじめる
    meaning: To start, To begin to
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「おわる」 which signifies the completion of an action, 「はじめる」 indicates the start of an
      action.
  - term: だす
    meaning: To suddenly begin, To start doing
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While 「おわる」 means to finish, 「だす」 implies a sudden commencement of an action.
  - term: 込む ②
    meaning: Remain, To do thoroughly, Deeply, Intensely
    kind: grammatical element
    nuance: Unlike 「おわる」 which indicates completion, 「込む」 (as a suffix) suggests doing something thoroughly
      or deeply until the end, but doesn't necessarily mean 'to finish' in the same way.
  - term: てしまう・ちゃう
    meaning: To do something by accident, To finish completely・totally, Unfortunately
    kind: grammatical element
    nuance: While 「てしまう/ちゃう」 can indicate finishing something completely, it often carries a nuance of
      regret or completion beyond intention, unlike the neutral completion indicated by 「おわる」.
  - term: 上がる・上げる
    meaning: Something is finished, To finish something, Something has come to an end, To do something
      completely, To do something through
    kind: grammatical element
    nuance: 「上がる/上げる」 can mean 'to finish' in certain contexts, but it often implies a sense of completion
      to a certain standard or degree, or that something has concluded. 「おわる」 is a more general term for
      ending.
  - term: 切る
    meaning: To do something completely to the end, Utterly, Resolutely
    kind: grammatical element
    nuance: 「切る」 used as a suffix implies a resolute and complete finishing of something, often with a
      stronger emphasis than the simple 'to finish' of 「おわる」.
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 「てしまう」, 「上がる」, and 「切る」 can sometimes convey the sense
  of finishing an action, they often carry additional nuances. 「てしまう」 often implies regret or doing something
  unintentionally until the end. 「上がる」 can suggest completion to a certain standard or the natural conclusion
  of something. 「切る」 emphasizes a resolute or thorough completion. It's important to consider these additional
  nuances when choosing between these expressions and the more straightforward 「おわる」.
