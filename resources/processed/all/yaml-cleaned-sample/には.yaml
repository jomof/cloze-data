  regarding a specific topic. The に indicates a target or purpose, while は emphasizes that what follows
  is specifically about that topic. Common translations include "in order to," "in regard to," or "for."
  It follows verbs in their dictionary form or nouns. Think of に as highlighting the 'target' and は showing
  that the subsequent statement is specific to that target, differentiating it from other possibilities.
