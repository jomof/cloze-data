writeup: |-
  The construction **にして** connects two nouns or na-adjectives, indicating that something possesses both qualities or fulfills both roles. It conveys the idea of "not only A, but also B" or "being A as well as B". This grammar point is considered formal and is often used in written language or more formal speech.

  *  It emphasizes that both conditions or roles are true simultaneously.
  *  Often used with set phrases like **幸いにして** (saiyai ni shite - fortunately) and **不幸にして** (fukō ni shite - unfortunately).
  *  Be mindful that while にして can mean "both A and B", it tends to be used with specific pairings that are commonly accepted. It's best to stick to patterns you've encountered before to avoid sounding unnatural.
  *  The tense of the sentence-ending verb influences the overall meaning, but the core function of にして remains emphasizing the combination of the preceding elements.
