writeup: |-
  In contrast to **に至っては**, which presents the most extreme examples **within** a specific category, **に至っても** presents an extreme point or situation from which a particular outcome **does not** occur. This difference stems from the adverbial particle **も** "even" replacing **は**. **に至っても** can be translated as "even if it came to (A), (B)" or "even when (A), (B)". Clause (B) often expresses a negative result, highlighting that even the extreme situation (A) couldn't change (B).

  This grammar point combines the case-marking particle **に**, the te-form of the る-verb **至る** "to reach", "to arrive at", or "to come to", and the adverbial particle **も**. **に至っても** follows nouns or verbs in their dictionary form.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  **Lament or Regret:** **に至っても** is frequently used when the speaker expresses disappointment or regret that despite reaching a significant or extreme point (A), the desired outcome (B) still hasn't happened or won't happen.
  *  **Determination:** Occasionally, **に至っても** can be used positively, especially when expressing strong resolve, implying that even if things reach a difficult point, the speaker will not give up.
