writeup: |-
  聞こえる is a verb that is often used to describe things that **can be heard**, or the **way in which something is heard**. Because of this, the most common translations of this verb are "to be audible", or "to sound like (A)". 聞こえる is an intransitive verb and literally means "to give off sound". When using 聞こえる, (A), the **source of the sound**, will always be followed by が. However, the **manner** in which something sounds will be marked adverbially. This means that an い-Adjective will be changed to its く form, and な-Adjectives/nouns will be followed by に.

  **Important Considerations**
  The primary difference between 聞こえる and 聞ける (the potential form of 聞く) is that 聞こえる is used to identify things that do not require the active concentration of the listener to be heard. In other words, **ambient noise**. However, 聞ける is used when the speaker is trying to concentrate on some specific sound and refers to their **ability** to hear it.

post_example_writeup: Remember that while both 聞こえる and 聞ける relate to hearing, 聞こえる describes sounds that
  naturally reach your ears without effort, whereas 聞ける implies the ability to actively listen and discern
  sounds.

  - term: れる・られる (Potential)
    meaning: To be able to do something, can do
    kind: grammatical suffix
    nuance: While both indicate the ability to perceive sound, 聞こえる focuses on the sound being audible,
      whereas the potential form of 聞く (聞ける) focuses on the ability to actively listen.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 聞こえる is about the inherent audibility of
  a sound, while 聞ける is about someone's capability to hear something through focused listening. If the
  sound comes to you without effort, use 聞こえる. If you are actively trying to hear something, use 聞ける.
