writeup: |-
  ぜ is an emphatic sentence-ending particle in Japanese, similar to よ. It adds emphasis to the speaker's statement but is generally considered less forceful than particles like ぞ. ぜ is used at the end of a sentence after the plain form of verbs and adjectives. When used with nouns and na-adjectives, it follows the auxiliary verb だ. This particle is typically used when speaking to someone the speaker is familiar with or has a close relationship with. While it often carries a friendly nuance, ぜ can also be used in conversations with rivals or individuals in similar competitive dynamics. Unlike ぞ, which can be used more broadly, ぜ is almost exclusively used by men.

  **Fun Fact:** The particle ぜ actually originated from the combination of ぞ and え, where え is an alternative form of the sentence-ending particle い (found in forms like だい and かい). Because い is primarily used in a friendly or familiar way, ぜ retains this nuance. Essentially, ぞえ evolved into ぜ, which over time became its own distinct particle.
