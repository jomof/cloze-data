writeup: 「と」 is a particle that is often thought of as meaning "and" in English, which is usually how
  it can be translated. Essentially, 「と」 connects nouns, indicating a relationship of compilation between
  them. This relationship generally signifies that the items exist together. You need to place 「と」 after
  each noun you are grouping. However, it's very common to omit the final 「と」 when listing several items.
  For example, saying 「りんごとみかん**と**バナナ」 (apple, orange, and banana) is grammatically correct, but in everyday
  conversation, you'll often hear 「りんごとみかんバナナ」, with the last 「と」 left out.

post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse 「と」 with similar particles. 「も」 adds to existing
  information, 「や」 provides examples, 「と共に」 emphasizes joint action or occurrence, 「につれて」 indicates a
  parallel change, and 「および」 is a formal 'and'. Understanding these nuances will help you choose the correct
  particle for your intended meaning.
