writeup: |-
  The grammar point **ようにいのる** combines **ように**, which expresses a wish or goal, with the verb **いのる (祈る)**, meaning "to pray" or "to beg." It conveys the idea of praying or hoping for a specific outcome. While it can be used in the context of actual prayer, it's more commonly used to express a strong hope or wish.

  Similar to other **ように** structures, you can use **ないようにいのる** to express praying for something *not* to happen.

  **Important Consideration:**

  Unlike other **ように** structures, **ように** can sometimes stand alone after **ます** to mean "to hope for." Be careful not to confuse this with other **ように** grammar points like **ようにする** or **ようになる**.

  **Etymology:**

  *  **よう (様)**: Originally meaning "manner" or "way of doing," it evolved to express a desired state or goal.
  *  **に**: In this context, it functions as a particle connecting **よう** to the verb **いのる**.
  *  **いのる (祈る)**: A verb meaning "to pray," "to wish," or "to beg."

    setting: humorous
    speaker_gender: female

    nuance: Maru-chan's use of 「ワシ」 (a somewhat old-fashioned and masculine first-person pronoun) and
      「〜のだ」 (a declarative sentence ending particle often used by older men or in dramatic contexts) creates
      a humorous and childlike tone. The te-form 「祈っている」 emphasizes the present action of praying.
post_example_writeup: As shown in the examples, the verb **いのる** can be omitted, especially when using
  the **ように** structure at the end of a sentence. This shortened form still conveys the meaning of hoping
  or wishing for something.
false_friends:
  - term: ように
    meaning: So that, In order to, In such a way that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **ようにいのる**, which specifically expresses a prayer or hope, **ように** by itself often
      indicates purpose or manner. For example, 「間に合うように早く出かけよう」 (Let's go out early so that we can be
      on time).
post_false_friends_writeup: While both **ようにいのる** and **ように** can express a desired outcome, **ようにいのる**
  carries the specific nuance of prayer or hope. When you simply want to state the purpose or manner of
  an action, use **ように** without **いのる**.
