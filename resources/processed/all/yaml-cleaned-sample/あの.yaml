writeup: '**あの** is classified as a "pre-noun adjectival" in Japanese. These are a special type of word
  that do not conjugate. This means that they will always appear in the same form. **あの** comes from the
  same family of words as **あれ** and **あそこ**, and is used to identify a "thing" that is away from both
  the listener and the speaker. It is usually translated as "that" (thing over there). As the name "pre-noun
  adjectival" suggests, these words will always appear **before a noun**, and describe that noun in some
  way.'

  - japanese: あの人はトムです。
    english: That person over there is Tom.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up **あの** with similar words, remember the relative distance
  each word implies. **この** refers to something near the speaker, **その** near the listener, and **あの**
  far from both. **あれ** and **あそこ** also refer to things/places far from both, but don't directly modify
  a noun like **あの** does. **どれ** is used for asking "which one?" while **あの** is used for stating "that
  one over there."
