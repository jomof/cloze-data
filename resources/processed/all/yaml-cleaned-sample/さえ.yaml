  さえ is an adverbial particle in Japanese that is used to place emphasis on something existing in a certain state. It is often translated as "even". さえ has three primary meanings:

  *  **Analogical Reasoning (類推):** (A) is an outstanding example of something.
  *  **Limit (限定):** (A) is all that is needed for something.
  *  **Addition (添加):** (A) compounds something that is pre-existing.

  さえ is regularly paired with other particles and is often followed by verbs in the negative form. The overall meaning is usually determined by what part (B) of the sentence is conveying. In each case, さえ shows that (A) is an extreme example.

  **Fun Fact:** は, も, でも, and さえ are all adverbial particles that can be thought of as having a relationship toward and away from what is "expected" in any given situation. This relationship can be visualized as:

  *  (A) は - (A) is completely expected; there is nothing unusual.
  *  (A) も - (A) will be included as part of what is expected but can be unusual.
  *  (A) でも - (A) may or may not be included as part of what is expected and can be unusual.
  *  (A) さえ - (A) is separated completely from what is expected and is unusual.

  Due to this unexpected and unusual situation that さえ always presents, it is regularly translated as "let alone (A)" or "not to mention (A)".

  nuances. まで often suggests an extension or limit, 割に implies a surprising contrast, and ても expresses
  a hypothetical situation. さえ specifically emphasizes an extreme or unexpected case. さえ〜ば always indicates
  a conditional "if only" or "as long as", which is distinct from the standalone さえ.
