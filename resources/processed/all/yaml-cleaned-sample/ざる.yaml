etymology: ざる is the attributive form of the classical negative auxiliary verb ず. ず itself originates
  from the combination of the negative particle 'ず' and the verb 'あり' (to be), which contracted over time.
writeup: |-
  ～**ざる** is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb **ず**, meaning "not". It functions similarly to **ない** in negating verbs but carries a more formal, literary, or archaic nuance. Think of it as a more emphatic or old-fashioned way to say "not". Because it's an attributive form, it directly modifies nouns that follow it. You'll often see ～ざる translating to "un-" in English.

  **Key Points:**

  *  **Attributive Function:** ～ざる always comes before a noun, modifying it.
  *  **Negative Meaning:** It conveys a negative meaning, equivalent to "not".
  *  **Formal or Literary Tone:** Its use lends a more formal or literary feel to the sentence.
  *  **Common in Fixed Expressions:** While it can replace ない, it's more frequently encountered in set phrases and idioms, such as **～ざるを得ない** (have no choice but to).
  *  **Conjugation of する:** Be aware that with the verb する, ～ざる attaches to the **せ** stem (せず) rather than the modern し stem (し).

  **Important Considerations:**

  While ～ざる expresses negation, its usage is more restricted than ない in modern Japanese. It's crucial to recognize its formal and often literary flavor. Using ～ざる casually might sound stiff or unnatural.

  ～ざる and simply using the negative form with ない. ～ざる adds a layer of formality or a literary touch.
