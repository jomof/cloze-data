writeup: |-
  Often seen after the potential form of verbs is the conjunction particle **ものなら**. This grammar pattern expresses that while (A) is not thought to be possible, if it were possible, (B). Common translations include "if (A), (B)", "if one could (A), (B)", and "if (A) were possible, (B)".

  As **ものなら** is just a combination of **もの** and the hypothetical form of **だ** (**なら**), **ものなら** simply states that if (A) were a "thing", then (B).

  Due to **ものなら** regularly expressing a desired outcome in the (B) part of sentences, this grammar structure will usually be accompanied by **てみる** or **てみたい**. Additionally, **もし** may also appear at the beginning of the sentence to further increase the nuance of "if".

  **てみる** is often used for criticism, suggesting that if someone thinks that (A) were possible, then perhaps they should try it. **てみたい** on the other hand is more commonly seen when (A) is wished for, and the speaker would like to do it if possible.

  While not a strict rule, the verb in both the (A) and (B) parts of **ものなら** sentences is frequently the same, especially when expressing a desire to do (A).

  - term: できれば・できたら
    meaning: If possible
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ものなら①」, 「できれば・できたら」 is a more direct expression of possibility and does not necessarily
      imply a sense of difficulty or unlikelihood. It's a simpler way to say 'if possible'.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「できれば」 and 「できたら」 both translate to "if possible," they are generally
  used in situations where the possibility is more open. 「ものなら①」 carries a stronger nuance of "if it were
  possible (but it likely isn't)". To avoid mixing them up, consider whether the situation is simply conditional
  or if there's an underlying sense of improbability or strong desire for something that might not be
  feasible.
