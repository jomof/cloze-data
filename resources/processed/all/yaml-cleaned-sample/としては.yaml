grammar_point: としては
jlpt: N2
meaning: As a, For a, As for
details:
  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
writeup: Similar to として, which means "as," the grammar point としては adds the particle は to emphasize the
  subject (A) as a distinct entity before making a comparison or assuming a result (B) from (A)'s perspective.
  としては can be translated as "as (A)" or "for an (A)." When (A) refers to a person or organization, it
  often highlights the speaker's assumption from that standpoint. This structure follows nouns and combines
  と (the te-form of する) and は. A literal translation might be something like, "regarding (A) being (A),
  (B)." When the noun connected to としては isn't a person or organization, the translation often becomes
  simply "as for." In these cases, としては introduces the broad topic (A) before the speaker shares their
  thoughts. Unlike にしては, としては is generally used for broader judgments considering all aspects of (A) and
  what is typically expected of it, rather than for expressing personal opinions.
