  When linked to a noun, をもとに is an expression that indicates that something is "based on (A)," "from (A)," or "according to (A)." This is a combination of を, the noun 元 'origin', and に. The literal meaning is similar to "with (A) as the origin, (B)," and is used primarily to reference a source from which something is created or started. Most of the time, をもとに will be written without kanji, but it is also possible to see it as を元に.

  As this grammar pattern is mainly used to highlight an origin of creation, it will often be seen in sentences that use verbs like 書く "to write", できる "to be able", and 作る "to make".

  **Important Consideration:** をもとに "based on" differs from に基づいて "based on," in that に基づいて indicates a foundation from which the judgment or conclusion of (B) is made, while をもとに focuses more on being a source of inspiration for (B), or enabling (B).

post_example_writeup: It's important to note the subtle difference between using 「をもとに」 and 「に基づいて」. While
  both translate to "based on," 「をもとに」 often implies creation or inspiration from a source, whereas 「に基づいて」
  suggests a more formal foundation for a judgment or action.

    nuance: While similar, 「に基づいて」 typically indicates a more formal and solid foundation, such as laws
      or evidence, for making decisions or judgments, contrasting with the potentially broader and more

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up these similar expressions, remember that 「をもとに」 often implies
  a starting point for creating something new, while the others emphasize adherence to a rule, dependence
  on a situation, or citing a source of information. 「に基づいて」 is closer in meaning but carries a more formal
  connotation of relying on a solid foundation for a decision or action.
