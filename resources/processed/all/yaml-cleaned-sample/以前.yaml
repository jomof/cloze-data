writeup: When used as a suffix, the noun 以前 (*izen*, “before”) indicates that a topic is being brought
  forward as not even fulfilling the minimum requirements of something else. It suggests that the subsequent
  point is so basic or fundamental that the current topic should be addressed first. This often translates
  to "before even (A)" in English and carries a nuance of criticism or highlighting a more crucial underlying
  issue. 以前 attaches directly to nouns, the dictionary form of verbs, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives. It's
  typically followed by the case-marking particle に or の, depending on whether it modifies a verb or noun,
  respectively. While 以前 shares the meaning of "before" with 前 (*mae*), 以前 emphasizes a greater distance
  in time or importance, making it an emphatic form of 前. This emphasis often creates the critical tone,
  implying "way before (A), (B)" or "long before you even think of (A), (B)."
