  「果たして」, being the て-form of the う-Verb「果たす」 "to fulfill", or "to come to fruition", is an expression that is used adverbially to strengthen phrases of speculation. It may be translated as "I wonder if (A)", "how actually (A)", or "how really (A)". 「果たして」 will often be seen paired with other structures that indicate speculation, such as 「だろうか」, 「でしょうか」, 「かな」, or 「かしら」; and can be thought of as just emphasizing them further. As this grammar point will be used adverbially, it will primarily appear at the beginning of sentences.

  In sentences that do not include other speculative grammar patterns such as 「だろうか」, 「果たして」 will regularly be translated as "sure enough", or "as expected".

  **Fun fact**: Coming from the base meaning of 「果たす」 "to come to fruition", 「果たして」 can be thought of as similar to "in the end" in almost all cases, as it merely expresses the speaker's thought process about "what will" or "what has" happened "in the end". If using this translation to memorize 「果たして」, it should also be noted that the nuance of what happens "in the end" is almost always something that the speaker either expected or assumed would happen in the first place.

  - term: さすが
    meaning: as one would expect, only natural, that is just like..., even
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「果たして」, 「さすが」 expresses admiration or recognition of someone's ability or a natural
      outcome, not just a wondering or expected result.
  - term: かな
    meaning: I wonder
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both can express wondering, 「果たして」 adds a stronger sense of doubt or emphasizes the
      question, whereas 「かな」 is a simpler expression of uncertainty.
  - term: ～のだろうか
    meaning: I wonder...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「かな」, 「～のだろうか」 expresses a question or doubt, but 「果たして」 placed before it enhances
      the feeling of uncertainty or the anticipation of a particular outcome.
post_false_friends_writeup: 「さすが」 is used when something turns out as expected because of someone's skill
  or a natural course of events. 「かな」 and 「～のだろうか」 are direct ways of saying "I wonder," while 「果たして」
  adds an extra layer of questioning or emphasizes the uncertainty of the outcome. Think of 「果たして」 as
  amplifying the "wonder" aspect of these other expressions or highlighting that something happened as
  one thought it would.
