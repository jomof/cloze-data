writeup: ね is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese, sometimes pronounced as ねえ. It's used when the speaker
  is seeking agreement or confirmation from the listener. Think of it as adding a soft "right?" or "isn't
  it?" to the end of a statement. You can attach ね to pretty much any sentence. Interestingly, ね can be
  considered the counterpart to the sentence-ending particle な. While ね expresses a feeling of shared
  understanding or an assumption of agreement, な emphasizes the speaker's own thoughts and feelings. You'll
  often hear よ and ね combined as よね. This combination strongly implies that the speaker expects the listener
  to agree. **Important Consideration:** ね is generally milder than でしょう or だろう. Sometimes, it's used
  almost habitually without a strong sense of seeking confirmation.

false_friends:
  - term: でしょう
    meaning: Right?, Probably, Isn't it?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ね, でしょう often expresses more uncertainty or is used when the speaker is making a judgment
      or prediction.
  - term: だろう
    meaning: Right?, Probably, Isn't it?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to でしょう, だろう implies a degree of conjecture or a less direct way of seeking agreement
      compared to the more straightforward ね.
  - term: じゃないか
    meaning: Isn't it?, Is it not?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Compared to ね, じゃないか is more assertive and can sometimes sound like a rhetorical question
      or a stronger affirmation.
post_false_friends_writeup: While でしょう, だろう, and じゃないか can sometimes be translated similarly to ね, they
  carry different nuances. でしょう and だろう often involve an element of the speaker's own judgment or prediction.
  じゃないか is more forceful and can express a stronger sense of agreement or a challenge.
