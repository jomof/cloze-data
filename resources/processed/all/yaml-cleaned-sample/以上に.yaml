  Similar to other grammar structures incorporating 「以上」, 「以上に」 indicates that something goes beyond a specific limit or extent. The particle 「に」 marks the word 「以上に」 attaches to, indicating an amount or degree. Therefore, 「以上に」 can be translated as "more than (A)" or "even more than (A)," where (A) represents that benchmark. 「以上に」 can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns in their plain forms.

  Occasionally, 「に」 might be replaced by 「の」 when emphasizing a specific amount or quantity using a subsequent noun. While this following noun might not always seem like a typical 'amount', it represents something the speaker uses as a basis for comparison or measurement in relation to (A).
