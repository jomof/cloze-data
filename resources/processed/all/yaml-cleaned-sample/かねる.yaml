writeup: |-
  兼ねる, a る-Verb meaning "to spread across" (usually 2 different activities or thought processes), often follows the ます-stem of other verbs in order to highlight that "(A) is not possible". However, 兼ねる often indicates that the speaker would actually like to do (A), but cannot due to some external circumstances such as difficulty, already being busy, being hesitant, etc. This particular grammar pattern will most frequently be seen in its non-kanji form, although both are possible. 兼ねる is somewhat formal, and may be used in cases where a phrase like できない would be considered too strong, so the speaker wants to lightly imply that (A) cannot be done.

  Fun fact - As 兼ねる means "to spread across", this expression can be thought of as similar to "to be a stretch" in English. It just indicates that doing the action of (A) would be a stretch of the speaker's ability or capacity.

      from the meaning of inability expressed by 「かねる」.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「かねる」 focuses on the inability or hesitation
  to do something. 「かねない」 expresses possibility, the opposite meaning. 「〜得ない」 is a stronger, more direct
  form of 'cannot'. 「わけにはいかない」 emphasizes the impossibility due to external factors or obligations. 「切れない」
  refers to an inability to finish something. Finally, 「を兼ねて」 is about doing two things at once, not about
  inability.
