writeup: '**もしかしたら** is an adverbial phrase used to express possibility or uncertainty. It translates
  to "perhaps," "maybe," or "possibly." It''s often used at the beginning of a sentence to introduce a
  hypothetical situation. The phrase itself is a combination of **もし** (if), **か** (a question particle),
  and **したら** (the past conditional form of する, to do). Literally, it could be interpreted as "if something
  happens to be the case." It frequently appears alongside **かもしれない**, further emphasizing the uncertainty
  of the statement, though **かもしれない** is not strictly required. Other similar expressions include **もしかすると**
  and **もしかして**.'

  in many situations. The choice often comes down to personal preference or subtle nuances in tone.
false_friends:
  - term: おそらく
    meaning: Probably, Perhaps, (Most) likely, (I) fear that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **もしかしたら**, **おそらく** suggests a higher degree of probability. While both express uncertainty,
      **おそらく** leans more towards a likely outcome.
  - term: かもしれない
    meaning: Might, Maybe, Probably
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While often used together with **もしかしたら**, **かもしれない** is a sentence ending that expresses
      possibility directly. **もしかしたら** is an adverb that sets up the possibility.
  - term: あるいは
    meaning: Or, Possibly, Maybe, Perhaps, Or possibly
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **もしかしたら**, **あるいは** can also function as a conjunction to present alternatives. When
      expressing possibility, it often suggests a slightly lower probability than **もしかしたら**.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **もしかしたら** functions as an adverb at the
  beginning of a sentence to introduce a possibility. **おそらく** implies a higher likelihood, **かもしれない**
  is a sentence ending expressing possibility, and **あるいは** can present alternatives or a slightly less
  probable possibility.
