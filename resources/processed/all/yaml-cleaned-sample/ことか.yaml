writeup: |-
  **ことか** combines the noun **こと** (thing, matter) with the question particle **か**. It's used at the end of a sentence to express a strong feeling of surprise, wonder, or emotion about the extent or degree of something. It often translates to "How..." or "What..." and implies the speaker is emphasizing the intensity of the feeling, sometimes to the point where it's hard to put into words. Words indicating quantity or degree, like **どれだけ** (how much), **どんなに** (how), or **何度** (how many times), frequently appear before the phrase to highlight this emphasis.

  While literally a question, **ことか** is rhetorical and doesn't expect an answer. It's more of an exclamation.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While the literal translation might suggest a question, in practice, **ことか** functions as an emphatic statement.
  *  This grammar point is more common in written language and can sound a bit formal or dramatic in everyday conversation. Using it in speech can add a touch of poetic or theatrical flair.
  *  Avoid using it in situations requiring a neutral or factual tone.

    speaker_gender: male

  - term: ものか
    meaning: Definitely not, Absolutely not, Impossible, Do you really think~?
    kind: synonym

      or disbelief. It's used to emphatically state that something will not happen or that the speaker
      strongly doubts it.
  - term: 一体
    meaning: (What) the heck?, (Who) in the world?, (Where) on earth?, (How many) f*ing...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While **一体** can also express surprise or emphasis, it's often used at the beginning of a
      question to express confusion, irritation, or to seek clarification. It focuses more on the uncertainty
      or the speaker's perplexity than the sheer magnitude of something like **ことか**.
post_false_friends_writeup: While **ものか** and **一体** share a similar function of adding emphasis or expressing
  strong feelings, their core meanings and typical usage differ from **ことか**. **ものか** is about negation
  or disbelief, **一体** is about questioning with strong emotion, while **ことか** is about exclaiming the
  intensity or degree of something.
