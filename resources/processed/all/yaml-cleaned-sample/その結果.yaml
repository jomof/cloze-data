writeup: '**その結果 (sono kekka)** is a conjunction in Japanese that signifies a consequence or outcome of
  a previously stated action or situation. The noun **結果 (kekka)** itself means "result." Therefore, **その結果**
  literally translates to "that result" and is used to introduce a sentence explaining what happened because
  of something else. It''s similar to saying "as a result of that" or simply "as a result." You''ll find
  **その結果** at the beginning of a sentence, connecting a cause in the previous sentence to its effect in
  the current one. It can be used for both positive and negative outcomes, but the focus is generally
  on the new state or condition that arose from the preceding event.'

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **その結果** always starts a new sentence to
  clearly present the consequence of a preceding event. While **ために** and **そのため(に)** also indicate cause
  and effect, they are used within the same sentence to explain the reason *for* something. **そこで** often
  suggests a more immediate reaction or action taken as a result. **したがって** is a more formal equivalent
  of "therefore." Paying attention to sentence structure and the level of formality will help differentiate
  these similar expressions.
