  Although のに is often thought of as a simple combination of the particles の and に, it is actually its own particle, with the meaning of "despite", or "in order to". In this lesson, we will focus primarily on the "despite" nuance. Due to のに being a conjunction particle, it can be linked to almost any word type to show that "despite (A), (B)". As with many conjunction particles, な will be required after a noun/な-Adjective, but before のに. It is also possible to see だのに, instead of なのに, but this is something that is only seen in certain dialects and would be considered incorrect by the vast majority of native speakers.

  **Fun Fact:**
  Regardless of having two quite different translations ("despite" and "in order to"), のに always functions in the same way.
  In the situation of "(A)のに, (B)", (B) is/will be the result.
  The only difference between how the nuance will be read is whether the (B) statement is a logical conclusion or an illogical one. When logical, the meaning is usually "in order to"; when illogical, the meaning is usually "despite".

post_false_friends_writeup: 'While these expressions share the commonality of expressing contrast or unexpectedness,
  they each carry subtle nuances. To avoid mixing them up, focus on the specific feeling you want to convey:
  blame or resentment (くせに), simultaneous actions (ながらも), a direct link to a previous statement (それなのに),
  or a decision made despite circumstances (それでも). のに is a more general way to express surprise or contrast
  without these additional connotations.'
