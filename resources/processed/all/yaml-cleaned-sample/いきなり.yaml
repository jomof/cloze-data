    **いきなり** is an adverb, typically written in hiragana, that means "suddenly," "all of a sudden," or "for no reason." It describes actions or events that happen abruptly and without any prior indication. Think of it as something coming completely out of the blue.

    As an adverb, **いきなり** usually appears at the beginning of a sentence or immediately before the verb it modifies.

    Interestingly, **いきなり** originates from the word **行き成り** (いきなり), though the kanji form is rarely used nowadays. The original meaning related to how a situation unfolds or develops. Because of this historical context, while often translated simply as "suddenly," it can also carry a nuance similar to "a sudden turn of events," emphasizing the unexpected nature of the change.
