writeup: With 途中 meaning "on the way", the addition of either the case marking particle に or で will indicate
  that something is either being done "on the way to (A)", "partway through (A)" or "in the middle of
  (A)". 途中 may be seen after verbs in their dictionary form, or nouns followed by の. As always, に will
  put more emphasis on the time or duration of (A), while で will put further emphasis on the process of
  (A) being the cause of (B), or being used as an opportunity to do (B). Let's take a look at both. The
  meanings of で and に in regard to this particular grammar point can overlap quite often, so it may be
  necessary to see many examples before the slight difference in nuance becomes apparent.
