writeup: |-
  In Japanese, the **連用形 (ren'yōkei)**, often referred to as the "masu-stem" or "conjunctive form," is a verb form used to connect clauses in a more formal manner than the common て-form. For verbs, this is the ます-stem (e.g., 食べます becomes 食べ). For い-adjectives, it's the form ending in く (e.g., 楽しい becomes 楽しく). The term "formal conjunctive" highlights its primary use in formal writing. Instead of using the conjunction particle て to link clauses, the 連用形 followed by a comma (読点) achieves the same effect. This creates a more structured and often more literary feel.

  Think of it as a way to say "and" or "then" in a more elevated style. While the て-form is ubiquitous in everyday conversation, the 連用形 in this conjunctive role is mostly encountered in written materials, formal speeches, or when aiming for a more sophisticated tone.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  A comma (読点) is typically placed after the verb or adjective in the 連用形 to clearly separate the clauses.
  *  This usage is far less common in spoken Japanese compared to the て-form.

post_example_writeup: While the examples show the 連用形 connecting clauses with a comma, remember its other
  uses, such as forming compound verbs (e.g., 読み始める - to begin reading) and acting as a noun (名詞的用法).
  This grammar point focuses specifically on its conjunctive function in formal contexts.
false_friends:
  - term: ではなくて・じゃなくて
    meaning: Not A but B, Conjunctive
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 連用形, 「ではなくて」 and 「じゃなくて」 explicitly negate the first clause and introduce a contrasting
      second clause. 連用形 simply connects two related ideas without explicit negation.
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse the formal conjunctive use of 連用形 with expressions
  like 「ではなくて」 or 「じゃなくて」. While both can connect clauses, 「ではなくて」 and 「じゃなくて」 have a distinct meaning
  of 'not A but B', whereas the 連用形 simply links ideas sequentially or as related descriptions.
