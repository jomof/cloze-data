writeup: The auxiliary verb **まい** expresses negative intention or strong presumption against something
  happening. It attaches directly to the **base form** of verbs. It conveys meanings like "won't (do something)",
  "intend not to (do something)", or "probably not (something)". Think of it as a more formal way of saying
  ～ないだろう. It's important to note the variations when used with the verbs **する (to do)** and **来る (to come)**.
