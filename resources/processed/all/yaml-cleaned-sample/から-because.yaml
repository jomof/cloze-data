writeup: から is a particle that indicates a reason or cause. It translates to "because" or "since" in English.
  The basic structure is **[Reason] から, [Result]**. It directly follows the noun, verb, or adjective that
  expresses the reason. When connecting a noun or na-adjective, it requires だ before から. Thinking of the
  core meaning, から inherently carries the nuance of "from." So, you can understand it as "From [reason],
  [result]", which evolves into "Because of [reason], [result]". It's one of the fundamental case marking
  particles in Japanese, showing the relationship between the reason and the outcome.
etymology: The particle から originally meant "from." This core meaning extends to expressing reasons, as
  the reason is the starting point or origin of the resulting action or state.
