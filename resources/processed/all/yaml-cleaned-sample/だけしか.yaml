  「だけしか」 is a combination of two adverbial particles, 「だけ」 meaning "only", and 「しか」 meaning "nothing but". This structure primarily follows nouns, and the latter part of the sentence will have a corresponding negative word. Although other combinations are possible, 「だけしか～ない」 is the most common structure, appearing far more frequently with negative verbs than other patterns.

  It might seem like 「だけしか」 is saying "only" twice, but each particle has its own distinct nuance:

  *  **「だけ」**: Narrows down from a group, presenting one item as the **sole** thing meeting a specific criterion.
  *  **「しか」**: Highlights an item existing in isolation, emphasizing the **lack** of alternatives.

  Combined, 「だけ」 says "just this", while 「しか」 adds "and *only* this!". Reversing the order to 「しかだけ」 would be illogical because the selection process requires identifying a singular item first before emphasizing the absence of others.

      「だけしか」 highlights Takeshi as the sole exception to the group's skill level.

      small quantity left, combined with the question marker 「の?」 to seek confirmation. The phrase 「全部食べちゃったんだ…」
      adds a touch of regret or self-blame, common for female speech.
post_example_writeup: Remember that while 「だけしか」 is often translated as "only," the inclusion of 「しか」
  adds a nuance of limitation or exclusivity, often implying that the speaker wishes there were more options
  or a larger quantity.
false_friends:
  - term: だけ
    meaning: Only, Just
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「だけしか」, 「だけ」 doesn't inherently carry the same strong sense of limitation or the implication
      that something is insufficient. It simply states that something is the only thing.
  - term: ばかり
    meaning: Just, Only, Nothing but
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ばかり」 often implies repetition or that something consists entirely of one thing, whereas 「だけしか」
      specifically emphasizes the singleness and potential scarcity.
  - term: しか～ない
    meaning: There's only, Nothing but
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「しか～ない」 has a very similar meaning to 「だけしか」, but 「だけしか」 can sometimes add a stronger sense
      of emphasis on the 'only' aspect.
  - term: きり
    meaning: Only, Just, Since
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「きり」 can also mean 'since' (referring to time), which 「だけしか」 cannot. When used as 'only',
      「きり」 often implies that something is the final or last one, while 「だけしか」 emphasizes exclusivity.
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share the idea of 'only', pay attention to the subtle
  differences in nuance. 「だけ」 is the most neutral, simply stating a fact. 「ばかり」 often describes a state
  of being composed entirely of one thing. 「しか～ない」 is very close to 「だけしか」 but might lack the added emphasis.
  「きり」 can also refer to a point in time. Understanding these subtle differences will help you choose
  the most appropriate expression.
