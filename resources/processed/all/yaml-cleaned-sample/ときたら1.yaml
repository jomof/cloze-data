The literal sense is "when it comes to (A)". It directly follows a noun. This grammar point is almost always written in kana.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While often used for expressing frustration, ときたら can also highlight an expected or natural characteristic of (A). The context of the sentence will make the intended nuance clear.
  *  Think of ときたら as generally meaning "when it comes to (A)", and the subsequent part of the sentence (B) will indicate whether the sentiment is negative (frustration) or positive (expected/natural).
