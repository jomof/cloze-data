  に比べて is a set expression in Japanese, used when comparing one thing to another. It is often simply translated as "(A) compared to (B)", or "when comparing (A) to (B)". 比べる is a る-verb that means "to compare", or "to contrast". に比べて is attached directly after a noun, and the following part of the sentence will explain the comparison being made. Occasionally, the case marking particle と will be used instead of に. に and と are largely interchangeable in this expression, with に focusing slightly more on the changes or differences between similar features of (A) and (B). Alternatively, と often mutually contrasts (A) and (B), discussing their individual and unique characteristics.

  **Important Considerations:**

  The way that 比べる is conjugated is flexible as long as the meaning of "if" or "when" is conveyed. Due to this, に比べたら, に比べれば, and に比べると are all possible and commonly used.

post_false_friends_writeup: While 割に and にしては can sometimes be used in similar contexts to に比べて, it's
  important to note their specific nuances. 割に often implies an element of surprise or unexpectedness,
  whereas にしては sets a certain expectation before presenting a contrasting fact. に比べて is a more direct
  and neutral way to compare two things without necessarily implying surprise or unmet expectations.
