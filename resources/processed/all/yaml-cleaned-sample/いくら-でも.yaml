writeup: |-
  Similar to どんなに～ても, いくら～でも generally translates to "no matter how (A), (B)". However, while どんな is a contraction of どのような, いくら is a noun derived from the kanji 幾ら, meaning "how much". When used with ても (for verbs and い-adjectives) or でも (for nouns and な-adjectives), the literal sense is "however much (A), (B)".

  With いくら～でも, the (B) part of the sentence often highlights something being negated, giving the phrase its "no matter how much" nuance. This is commonly seen with negative endings like ～ない or ～ません.

  Despite this tendency to appear in negative sentences, いくら～でも can also be used in positive contexts. In these cases, the (B) part will express something surprising or unexpected due to its extent or amount.

  **Important Distinction:**
  *  いくら emphasizes the **amount** or **quantity** of something.
  *  どんなに emphasizes the **type** or **manner** of something.

  Therefore, いくら is a better fit when focusing on the *volume* of something, while どんなに sounds more natural when discussing the *state* or *condition*. Despite this distinction, they are often used interchangeably.

  - term: どんなに〜ても
    meaning: No matter how

    kind: similar expression
    nuance: どうしても carries a stronger sense of determination or inevitability, whereas いくら〜でも focuses on
      the extent or amount despite effort.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing いくら〜でも with similar expressions, remember that いくら focuses
  on the quantity or degree. When you want to emphasize that something doesn't change *regardless of the
  amount* of effort, time, or extent, いくら is the appropriate choice. どんなに is more about the *manner* or
  *state*, and どうしても implies a stronger sense of will or inevitability.
