writeup: The suffix **ぶり (振り)**, when voiced as **ぶり**, indicates a lapse of time since the last occurrence
  of an event or action. It translates to "for the first time in (a period of time)" or "haven't done
  (something) for (a period of time)". As a suffix, **ぶりに** is attached directly to a noun representing
  the time period. The particle **に** follows **ぶり** to indicate the time elapsed before the current event.
  You can also use **ぶりの** to directly modify a noun, indicating something related to that duration, like
  「十年ぶりの再会」(a reunion after ten years). **Important Considerations:** While grammatically correct, using
  **ぶりに** for very short durations (minutes, seconds, hours) might sound unnatural. It's generally used
  for more significant time intervals.

  might sound unnatural in everyday conversation. For instance, saying 「51分ぶり」 feels a bit odd. It's best
  to use 「ぶり」 for more significant periods of time.
