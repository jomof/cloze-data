  The grammar point 「に足る」 (nitariru) expresses the idea of something being **worthy of**, **enough for**, or **sufficient for** a particular purpose or feeling. It's a fairly formal expression, often found in written materials, speeches, or more serious conversations. The verb 「足る」 (tariru) means "to be sufficient." When combined with 「に」, it creates this sense of worthiness or sufficiency.

  Here's how it's structured:

  *  **Verb (dictionary form) + に足る:** This indicates that the action described by the verb is worthy of something.
  *  **Noun + に足る:** This indicates that the noun is worthy of something.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Since 「足る」 is always in its dictionary form in this construction, any tense or negation is applied to the noun or verb it modifies.
  *  When expressing that something is **not** worthy of something, you negate the following noun or verb, not 「足る」 itself. You would not say 「に足りない」 in this context.

post_example_writeup: Notice how in the negative example, we negate the noun 「人物」 (person) rather than
  the verb 「足る」. This is the standard way to express something being 'not worthy of'.

    nuance: Unlike 「に足る」 which focuses on worthiness or sufficiency, 「たる」 indicates a role, position,
      or suitability. For example, 「医者たる者」 (isha tarumono) means "as a doctor".
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「に足る」 and 「たる」 are formal, they have distinct meanings. 「に足る」 is
  about something being deserving or adequate, whereas 「たる」 defines a state of being or qualification.
