  **つもりで** is a grammatical structure that combines the noun **つもり** (intention) with the case-marking particle **で** (with). Its meaning varies depending on the form of the word preceding it.

  *  When used with verbs, な-adjectives, or nouns in their plain form, **つもりで** indicates that action (B) is performed with the intention of doing (A). Remember that when connecting nouns to **つもりで**, you need the particle **の**, and for な-adjectives, use **な**.

  *  When used with verbs in the past tense, **つもりで** implies acting as if (A) is true, pretending that (A) is the case, or being convinced of (A), even if it isn't actually true. This usage arises from the disconnect between the intended state and the actual reality.

  - term: よていだ
    meaning: Plan to, Intend to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **つもりで**, **よていだ** (予定だ) directly expresses a future plan or intention. It doesn't
      carry the nuance of acting as if something is the case when used with past tense verbs.
  - term: つもりだ
    meaning: To plan to, To intend to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to **よていだ**, **つもりだ** directly states an intention or plan. It doesn't have the same
      range of uses as **つもりで**, especially the 'acting as if' meaning.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both **よていだ** and **つもりだ** express intention, they are more direct statements
  of future plans. **つもりで** has a broader range of application, including describing the purpose behind
  an action and, crucially, conveying the idea of acting or believing something to be true. Be mindful
  of the context to choose the most appropriate expression. When you want to say someone *is* planning
  something, use **つもりだ** or **よていだ**. When you want to say someone did something *with the intention
  of* something, or *acted as if*, use **つもりで**.
