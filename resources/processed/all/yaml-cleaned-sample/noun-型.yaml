  型 (kata) or 形 (katachi) are two kanji that are often used as a suffix to indicate that something is 'shaped' or 'sized' according to the preceding noun. The primary reading of both kanji is かた, but it becomes がた (gata) due to 連濁 (rendaku, sequential voicing) when directly attached to a noun.

  型 can be attached directly to the end of nouns or い-adjectives. Occasionally, 型 will follow the case-marking particle の. In these instances, because it's connected to の and not directly to the noun, it's read as かた (kata), not がた (gata).

  While both kanji can be used, 型 is far more common than 形. This is mainly due to their core meanings:

  *  **型 (kata):** Form (referring to design, pattern, type, or model).
  *  **形 (katachi):** Shape (referring to physical shapes only, like square, rectangle, triangle).

  Therefore, 型 is used when describing abstract forms or patterns, whereas 形 is primarily for basic, visible shapes.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Sometimes, 型 might be read as けい (kei), the *on'yomi* (Chinese reading). This usually happens when it's part of a compound word using *on'yomi* or when it's not used as a suffix but as part of a fixed expression.

    etymology: 星形 (hoshi-gata) combines 星 (hoshi, star) and 形 (kata, shape). In this case, 形 is used because
      it refers to a physical shape.

post_example_writeup: Notice the difference in kanji used for 'shape' in the first and sixth examples
  (星形 and ハート形). When referring to basic geometrical shapes, 形 is preferred. However, when referring to
  a model or type, 型 is used more frequently, as seen in other examples like 犬型ロボット and 新しい型の自転車.
