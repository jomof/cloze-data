writeup: The expression 「～と言っても」 combines 「と言う」 (to say/quote) and 「ても」 (even if/though). It translates
  to "even if I say (A)" or "although I say (A)". The speaker uses this structure to present a statement
  (A), often something that might seem significant or be a common perception, and then immediately qualifies
  or contrasts it with another point (B). The purpose is to draw the listener's attention to (B) for clarification
  or a more nuanced understanding. Because 「と」 acts as a quotation marker, 「～と言っても」 can follow almost
  any word in various tenses. Nouns and な-adjectives are sometimes followed by 「だ」 before 「と」, though
  this is often omitted. Interestingly, because 「言う」 focuses on the act of saying rather than a specific
  speaker, if no speaker is explicitly mentioned (using 「が」), 「と言っても」 can also imply "although some might
  say (A)" or "even though it is said that (A)".
