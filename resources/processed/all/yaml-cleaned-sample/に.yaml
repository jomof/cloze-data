  The particle に is a fundamental particle in Japanese with several core meanings, often translated as "in," "at," "to," "for," or "on." Think of に as marking the **endpoint** or **target** of an action or state. This can be a physical location, a point in time, or the recipient of an action.

  *  **Location:** に indicates a place where something exists or an action occurs. For example, 「ここにいます」 (I am here).
  *  **Direction/Destination:** に marks the destination of movement. For example, 「駅に行きます」 (I go to the station).
  *  **Time:** に specifies a specific point in time. For example, 「三時に会います」 (I will meet at three o'clock).
  *  **Indirect Object:** に indicates the recipient of an action. For example, 「友達にプレゼントをあげます」 (I will give a present to my friend).
  *  **Purpose/Goal:** When used with verbs of motion, に can indicate the purpose of going somewhere. For example, 「買い物に行きます」 (I will go shopping).

  While English uses different prepositions, thinking of に as an endpoint will help you understand its various uses.

post_example_writeup: Remember that the specific meaning of に depends on the verb and the context of the
  sentence. Paying attention to the action and the noun に is attached to will help you understand its
  function.

  - term: で (at)
    meaning: At, In
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both に and で can indicate location, で marks the **location where an action takes place**,
      whereas に indicates the **location of existence or arrival**. For example, 「公園で遊びます」 (I will play
      in the park - action takes place there) vs. 「公園にいます」 (I am in the park - location of existence).
  - term: にて
    meaning: In, At, With, Using, By
    kind: synonym
    nuance: にて is a more formal equivalent of で and sometimes に, often used in written Japanese or formal
      announcements. It can also mean "by means of" or "using," which に does not. For example, 「会議は本社にて行われます」
      (The meeting will be held at the head office).
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, focus on the nuance of the verb. If the verb describes
  an action happening *at* a place, で is usually more appropriate. If the verb describes existence or
  movement *to* a place, に is generally used. にて is a formal alternative that sometimes overlaps with
  these uses, especially in official contexts.
