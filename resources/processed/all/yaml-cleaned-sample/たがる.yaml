writeup: As we explored in our lesson about がる, this verb can be used with adjectives to express how people
  are acting or feeling. Similarly, when combined with the auxiliary verb たい, it forms たがる. This grammar
  construction expresses that a **third person** acts as if they "want" to do something. To use this structure,
  attach たい to the ます-stem form of a verb, then replace the い in たい with がる. **Important Considerations:**
  たがる contrasts with てほしい, which means "to want someone to do (A)". These have different nuances and should
  be practiced carefully. It also differs from the い-adjective 欲しい "to want (A)". To describe that someone
  seems like they want something (rather than wanting to *do* something), がる is paired with this adjective.

post_example_writeup: Remember that 「たがる」 is used to describe what a third person *appears* to want. It's
  about their behavior suggesting a desire, not a direct expression of their own will. Pay close attention
  to the difference between 「たがる」 and 「てほしい」. The former is about observing someone's inclination, while
  the latter is about your own desire for someone else's action.

    meaning: Want to do (First person)

  - term: がほしい
    meaning: To want something, to be in need of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「たがる」, 「がほしい」 refers to wanting a noun or an object, not wanting to perform an action.
      When used with がる, it describes someone acting like they want something.
  - term: てほしい
    meaning: I want you to (do something)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「たがる」, 「てほしい」 expresses the speaker's desire for someone else's action. 「たがる」 describes
      a third person's apparent desire.
  - term: がる
    meaning: To feel, to think, to act as if, to want, to desire
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「がる」 on its own is used with adjectives to describe someone exhibiting a certain feeling or
      acting a certain way (e.g., 寒がる - to act like one is cold). 「たがる」 specifically describes acting
      as if one wants to do something.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember the core function of each grammar point. 「たい」
  is for your own desires, 「がほしい」 is for wanting things, 「てほしい」 is for wanting others to act, and 「たがる」
  is for describing a third person's apparent desire to do something. Practice identifying the speaker's
  perspective and the type of desire being expressed.
