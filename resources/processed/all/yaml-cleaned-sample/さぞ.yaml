writeup: |-
  **さぞ** is a fairly formal adverb in Japanese used emphatically to express the speaker's strong assumption or empathy towards the listener's feelings or situation. It conveys a sense of "I can only imagine how much..." or "You must be very...". It often expresses sympathy or understanding for a difficult or significant experience the listener might be going through.

  Think of it as the speaker trying to put themselves in the listener's shoes and drawing a likely conclusion about their state.

  *  さぞ typically appears at the beginning of a sentence.
  *  The sentence often ends with **だろう** or **でしょう**, indicating the speaker's surmise.
  *  While the meaning is similar, **さぞかし** is more commonly used and adds a slightly stronger emphasis than さぞ.

  **Etymology:** さぞ comes from the kanji **嘸**, which can also be read as **さぞや** or **さぞかし**. These alternative readings function as even more emphasized versions of さぞ, though さぞかし is the most frequently encountered of the three.

      a common casual way to express conjecture.

    register: formal
    setting: formal
    listener_age: older
    nuance: This example demonstrates さぞ in highly formal written Japanese. 「御子息様」 (ごしそくさま) is an extremely
      polite way to refer to someone's son, and 「～と思います」 (～とおもいます) is a standard polite expression.
    etymology: 「御子息様」 is a very respectful term for 'your son'.
  - japanese: 家族が一生懸命働いているのに、あなただけ毎日遊んでいるだけ、さぞ楽しいでしょうね！
    english: '''Even though your family is working so hard, you are just having fun every day, how fun
      it must be!'''
    register: sarcastic
    setting: sarcastic
    nuance: The tone here is clearly sarcastic. While さぞ implies the speaker understands the situation,
      the addition of 「～でしょうね！」 (～でしょうね！) with the rising intonation conveys the opposite - the speaker
      believes the listener's enjoyment is inappropriate given the circumstances. The 「！」 adds to the
      emphasis.
    etymology: 「一生懸命」 (いっしょうけんめい) means 'with all one's might' or 'very hard'.
post_example_writeup: While さぞ often expresses sympathy, it can also be used in other contexts, such as
  when expressing an assumption about a positive situation or even in a sarcastic manner, as seen in the
  last example. The key is that the speaker is conveying a strong belief or understanding about the listener's
  state.
