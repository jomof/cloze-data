  As mentioned in the わ grammar point, わ is an adverbial particle that is commonly used in cases of stress or emphasis in Japanese. When used after verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns in their standard forms, it generally implies that (A) and (B) are negative factors that have led to (C), where (C) is either a negative outcome or a negative opinion. It will often be translated simply as "with (A) and (B), (C)". To use this structure, simply place わ after a word and then repeat it after a second (different) word. In the case of な-Adjectives or nouns, だわ will be used. The case-marking particle で will then follow the second わ, indicating "with" or "as a consequence of."

  **わ～わで**, like わ, primarily emphasizes the speaker's surprise regarding the words that appear before it. However, unlike わ, where the same verb is repeated to highlight an excessive extent, わ～わで simply indicates surprise in terms of irritation or frustration. This structure is predominantly used by men, but women may also sometimes use it. However, there are several different variations of わ depending on where they appear in sentences, each with gender usage tendencies that need to be learned.

  In essence, わ is used similarly to し～し, where the words they are attached to are just being listed as reasons. Additionally, the で may occasionally be omitted.

  **Fun Fact:** わ is simply an emphatic version of the usual は adverbial particle and originates from は being changed to わ. Due to this, the literal meaning can be thought of as a stronger version of the standard "as for (A)" meaning of は.

  **Caution:** While this grammar pattern is used almost exclusively with a negative nuance, it may, in rare cases, have a positive nuance.
