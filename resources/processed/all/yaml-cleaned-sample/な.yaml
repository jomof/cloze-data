writeup: 「な」 is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese used to express a strong prohibition or command
  **not** to do something. It's attached directly to the dictionary form of a verb. This particle carries
  a forceful nuance, making it suitable for situations where clear and direct commands are necessary.
examples:
  - japanese: 行くな。
    english: Don't go.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    nuance: The directness of 「行くな」 is characteristic of casual commands.
  - japanese: 危ないから、そんな所に登るな。
    english: It's dangerous, so don't climb up to a place like that.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    nuance: 「登るな」 combined with 「危ないから」 creates a warning.
  - japanese: ねえ、そんなにじっと見つめるなよ。
    english: Hey, don't stare at me so intently.
    register: shitashii kuchō
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The 「～よ」 softens the directness of 「見つめるな」 slightly, creating a playful, intimate tone typical
      of male speech. The intent is flirty rather than genuinely commanding.
  - japanese: まだ早いから、帰るなって。
    english: It's still early, so don't go home, okay?
    register: casual
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「帰るな」 is a direct way to say 'don't go home', and the 「って」 is used to convey what was said,
      implying a plea or suggestion rather than a strict command in this context. It fits a casual, early-romantic
      setting.
  - japanese: 人に迷惑をかけるようなことは絶対にするな。
    english: Absolutely do not do things that would trouble other people.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The addition of 「絶対に」 (absolutely) emphasizes the prohibition of 「するな」, making it a strong
      and serious statement.
post_example_writeup: While 「な」 is a direct way to express prohibition, it's generally considered less
  polite than other forms like 「ないでください」. The tone can range from a friendly warning to a stern command,
  depending on the context and the relationship between the speakers.
false_friends:
  - term: てください
    meaning: Please do (Polite request)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「な」 which prohibits an action, 「てください」 politely requests an action.
  - term: てごらん
    meaning: (Please) try to, (Please) look
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike the prohibitive nature of 「な」, 「てごらん」 encourages someone to attempt something or to
      look at something.
  - term: なさい
    meaning: Command to do
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While both express commands, 「なさい」 is a command to *do* something, whereas 「な」 is a command
      *not* to do something. 「なさい」 is also often used by those in a position of authority, like parents
      to children.
  - term: たまえ
    meaning: (Please) do!, Ask to, Beg to, (Order somebody to do something)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Similar to 「なさい」, 「たまえ」 commands action, the opposite of 「な」's prohibition. 「たまえ」 is also
      considered quite formal and often used by men to those of lower status.
  - term: ないでください
    meaning: Please don't (Polite request)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Both 「な」 and 「ないでください」 express prohibition, but 「ないでください」 is a more polite and softer way
      of saying 'please don't'.
  - term: ないで
    meaning: Without doing, Not ~ and ~
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「ないで」 can express 'without doing', similar to the prohibitive nuance of 「な」, it doesn't
      carry the same strong commanding feeling. It focuses on the state of *not* doing something.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「な」 is a direct and somewhat forceful way
  to say 'don't do X'. If you want to be polite, use 「ないでください」. Forms like 「てください」, 「てごらん」, 「なさい」, and
  「たまえ」 are used to tell someone *to do* something, the opposite of 「な」.
