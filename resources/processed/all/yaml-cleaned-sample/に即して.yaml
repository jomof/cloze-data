  「に即して」 is a formal grammar structure used to express that something is being done to handle a matter in the best way possible. It combines 「に」 with the する-verb 「即する」 (sokusuru), meaning "to conform to," "to be based on," in its て-form. Occasionally, 「に則して」 (nishitagatte) is used as a synonym, meaning "following" or "in accordance with." This structure typically precedes nouns, or when one noun directly modifies another, 「に即した」 is used instead of 「に即して」.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  「に即して」 is generally used when actions are based on existing circumstances or situations.
  *  「に則して」 tends to be used when actions are based on established rules, laws, policies, or standards.
  *  While there are semantic differences, 「に即して」 is often used in place of 「に則して」 in contemporary Japanese, as there are situations where using 「に則して」 would be incorrect.
