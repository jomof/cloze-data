  **どうしても (doushitemo)** is a Japanese adverb that conveys a strong sense of inevitability, determination, or desire. It's often translated as "no matter what," "regardless of," or "by all means."

  Originally, it comes from the combination of **どう (dou)** meaning "how" and the **ても (temo)** form of **する (suru)**, which is **しても (shitemo)** meaning "even if (one) does." So, literally, it could be understood as "even if (it's done) how."

  There are two main ways **どうしても** is used:

  *  **At the beginning of a sentence:** In this case, it emphasizes the speaker's strong feeling that something is inevitably true or that they are absolutely determined to do something.
  *  **After a verb followed by the particle と (to):** This construction expresses the idea that if the first action occurs, the second action is unavoidable or a natural consequence.

  **Etymology:** The etymology highlights the idea that even considering all possible ways or circumstances (**どう**), the outcome remains the same or the desire persists (**ても**). This underscores the sense of inevitability or strong will associated with **どうしても**.

  When you want to emphasize your strong feeling or the inevitability of something, **どうしても** is often
  the most suitable choice.
