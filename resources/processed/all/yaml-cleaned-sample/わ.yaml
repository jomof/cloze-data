  The sentence-ending particle **わ** is primarily used by women to add emphasis to a statement or to seek agreement or understanding from the listener. It can convey a sense of confirmation-seeking, mild exclamation, or simply adding a feminine touch to speech. It's similar to adding "you know?" or "right?" in English, but often with a slightly softer and more expressive feeling. It can also express surprise or admiration, similar to "oh!" or "wow!".

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Gender:** While traditionally considered a feminine particle, men can also use **わ**, but the nuance differs. For men, it often expresses surprise, light exasperation, or a feeling of resignation about something unavoidable. The intonation is also different; women typically use a rising intonation, while men use a falling intonation.
  *  **Formality:** **わ** is generally considered informal and is not appropriate in very formal or business settings.
  *  **Attachment:** **わ** is attached to the plain form of verbs, i-adjectives, and na-adjectives (including だ and です).
