writeup: |-
  The expression **折には (おりには)** uses the noun **折 (おり)**, meaning "fold," "break," or "opportunity," combined with the particle **に**. It signifies a specific time or occasion that presents an opportunity to do something. It's a more formal way of saying **時に (ときに)**, "when," and often carries a nuance of politeness or indicating a favorable moment.

  Think of it as highlighting a "window of opportunity". It's frequently used in formal contexts, such as business correspondence or polite invitations.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Formality:** **折には** is more formal than **時に**. Use it in appropriate settings.
  *  **Opportunity:** It emphasizes the idea of a specific chance or occasion.
  *  **Common Expressions:** Be aware of similar expressions like **折に触れて (おりにふれて)**, meaning "on every occasion," **折があれば (おりがあれば)**, meaning "if there's a chance," **折を見て (おりをみて)**, meaning "waiting for the right moment," and **折も折 (おりもおり)**, meaning "at that very moment."
