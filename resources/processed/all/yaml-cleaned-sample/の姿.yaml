  When the noun 姿 "figure" is used as a suffix, it describes the outward appearance of someone. This may be in relation to what the person is wearing, their overall shape, body type, or style. 姿 is often translated as "(A) looking", "wearing (A)", "clad in (A)", or "performing (A)". 姿 may be used after verbs in their attributive form, or after nouns followed by the case marking particle の. 姿 is a word that focuses primarily on the way that someone appears to an observer. Therefore, it is also often used to describe the observer's impression of who they are looking at, in regard to their presence, or lack thereof.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  After nouns, の will sometimes be omitted, but this is not always the case. In general, の may be dropped after kanji compounds, but not after simple words like 人, 時, 元, etc.
