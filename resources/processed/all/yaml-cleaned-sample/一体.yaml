writeup: |-
  To express surprise, disbelief, or exasperation, the adverb **一体 (いったい)** is used in Japanese. It conveys a sense of "what the heck," "who in the world," "where on earth," or similar strong questioning. 一体 is frequently written in hiragana (いったい) but can also appear in kanji. It typically appears at the beginning of a sentence, often before a question word like 何 (nani - what), 誰 (dare - who), どこ (doko - where), or どうして (doushite - why). It emphasizes the speaker's difficulty in understanding a situation or their strong emotional reaction to it.

  The literal meaning of 一体 is "one body" or "one form." When used in questions, you can think of it as asking "in a way that can be understood, what is...?" or "in a way that makes sense, why is...?"

  **Important Consideration:** While less common now, 一体 can also mean "generally" or "in general" when used as 一体に (いったいに). However, its primary usage today is to express surprise or shock.

      The speaker's gender is inferred from the generally softer tone, though not strictly exclusive to
      females.

    english: What in the world will become of us in the future... huh?

    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The 「僕たち」 (bokutachi - we) implies a close relationship. 「～んだろう」 expresses a wondering aloud,
      and the 「ね」 seeks agreement or empathy from the listener. This is a common way for a male speaker
      to express vulnerability to a female in an intimate setting.

      flirty contexts by male speakers.

    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Starting with 「初めて会った時から気になってたんだけど」 (hajimete atta toki kara ki ni nattetan dakedo - I've
      been curious since we first met) sets a romantic tone. Using 「一体」 adds a touch of playful inquisitiveness.
      This is a natural way to express interest on a first date.
false_friends:
  - term: ことか
    meaning: How…, What..., God knows...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「一体」, 「ことか」 is typically used at the end of a sentence to express a strong emotional
      feeling, often regret or admiration. It doesn't directly translate to the questioning nuance of
      「一体」.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「一体」 and 「ことか」 can express strong emotions, they function differently
  in a sentence. 「一体」 usually starts a question to convey surprise or disbelief. On the other hand, 「ことか」
  concludes a statement, emphasizing the degree of a feeling, often of wonder or difficulty. To avoid
  confusion, remember that 「一体」 prompts a question born from surprise, while 「ことか」 expresses a strong
  emotional realization.
