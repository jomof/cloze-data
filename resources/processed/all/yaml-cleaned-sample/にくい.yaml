  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
etymology: にくい comes from the い-adjective 難(くる)い, which shares the same kanji as 難しい (むずかしい - difficult).
  This connection highlights the nuance of difficulty in terms of skill or inherent challenge.
writeup: Similar to 易い, **にくい** is an い-adjective that attaches to the ます stem of verbs. However, unlike
  易い which means "easy to do", **にくい** means "difficult to do" or "hard to do". The verb preceding **にくい**
  is the action that is considered difficult. The core nuance of **にくい** is that the difficulty arises
  from the nature of the task itself, perhaps due to the required skill, complexity, or inherent obstacles.
  This contrasts with づらい, which suggests difficulty stemming from discomfort, emotional resistance, or
  unpleasantness.

  - term: やすい
    meaning: Easy to, Likely to
    kind: antonym

      happen.
  - term: がたい
    meaning: Hard to, Difficult to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both express difficulty, がたい often implies that something is emotionally or morally
      difficult, or that it's something one can't bring oneself to do, whereas にくい focuses on inherent
      difficulty or skill.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **にくい** relates to the inherent difficulty
  or complexity of an action, while **やすい** signifies ease or likelihood. **がたい** expresses a deeper sense
  of difficulty, often tied to emotions or morality, making it something one struggles to do on a personal
  level.
