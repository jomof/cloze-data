writeup: |-
  The suffix ずくめ indicates that something is comprised entirely of the preceding noun. It conveys the idea of "completely (noun)", "all in (noun)", or "nothing but (noun)". The term originally came from the suffix 尽(つく) meaning "completely" or "using solely," combined with め. While the older form づくめ exists, the modern standard is ずくめ. When ずくめ directly modifies another noun, the particle の is inserted between them (e.g., 黒ずくめの男). While it can be used in both positive and negative contexts, it's often found in set expressions, so familiarity with common collocations is beneficial.

  **Important Consideration:** Be aware of the similar-sounding 尽(づく)し(づくし), which means "all sorts/kinds of (A)". While ずくめ implies homogeneity, 尽くし implies variety.
