  The grammar point **Verb + てもいい** expresses permission or allowance. It translates to "it's okay to do...", "it's alright to do...", or can be used as a question asking "can I do...?" or "may I do...?"

  This structure is formed by taking the **て-form** of a verb and adding **もいい** (も良い). While **てもいい** is the standard form, removing the **も** to form **ていい** is common in casual speech among people who know each other well.

  **Important Consideration:** Remember the rules for forming the て-form. While most verbs simply add て, some verbs will change their ending and add either **で** or **いて**.

    english: I'm tired, so is it okay if I take a short break?
    conjugation: polite

      in an academic setting.
    etymology: 「もう一度」 means 'one more time'.

  reserved for casual conversations with people you are close to. Using 「てもいい」 is always a safe and polite
  option.
false_friends:
  - term: てもいい
    meaning: It is alright/fine/okay even if, Can/may, ~ is also okay
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar in appearance, when used with different intonation or context, 「てもいい」 can express
      that something is acceptable even in a certain condition, or it can emphasize that something *is
      also* acceptable.
  - term: ても
    meaning: Even if, Even though
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「Verb + てもいい」 which asks or grants permission, 「Verb + ても」 expresses a concession or
      condition, like "even if I do...".
  - term: てもかまわない
    meaning: It doesn't matter if, I don't mind
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「てもかまわない」 also expresses acceptance, it carries a nuance of indifference or not minding,
      whereas 「てもいい」 is more direct permission.
  - term: Verb + て
    meaning: And, Then (Linking events)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「Verb + て」 is used to connect actions or events sequentially, not to ask or grant permission
      like 「Verb + てもいい」.
  - term: といってもいい
    meaning: You could say, You might say
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「といってもいい」 expresses a possibility or way of describing something, not permission. For example,
      「天才だといってもいい」 (You could say he's a genius).
  - term: でよければ
    meaning: If it is alright, If you don't mind, If you would like, If possible
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「でよければ」 is used to offer something with a condition of it being acceptable to the other person,
      not directly asking for or giving permission like 「てもいい」.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「てもいい」 directly addresses the permissibility
  of an action. Expressions like 「ても」 focus on conditional circumstances, 「てもかまわない」 on indifference, 「Verb
  + て」 on sequencing, 「といってもいい」 on alternative descriptions, and 「でよければ」 on conditional offerings.
