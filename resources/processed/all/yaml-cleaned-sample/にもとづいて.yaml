  The grammar point **にもとづいて** (ni motozuite) is used to express that something is based on or in accordance with something else. It combines the particle **に** (ni), the verb **基づく** (motozuku) meaning "to be based on", and the **て**-form of the verb. This structure indicates that a judgment, action, or creation is derived from a particular source or foundation.

  You can also use the past tense form **に基づいた** (ni motozuita) directly before a noun to describe something that is based on that noun. For example, 「事実に基づいた話」 (jijitsu ni motozuita hanashi) means "a story based on facts".

  **Key takeaway:** にもとづいて highlights the origin or foundation of something.
