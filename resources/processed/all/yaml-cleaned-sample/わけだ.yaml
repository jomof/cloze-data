writeup: One of the most misunderstood words in Japanese is 訳 (wake). Of the many ways it can be translated,
  the most common are "reason", "cause", "meaning", or "conclusion". Despite this, it may be beneficial
  to consider it almost identical to the versatile English word "so". In all of its uses, わけ (wake) simply
  highlights the plain existence or determination of something, similar to how "so" functions in English.
  This is evident in its most basic form, わけだ (wake da). This combines わけ (wake) and the auxiliary verb
  だ (da). わけだ (wake da) is used at the end of sentences and is sometimes preceded by という (to iu). This
  usage is often translated as "for the reason of (A)", "no wonder it's (A)", or "it's (A), as you'd expect".
  Realistically, though, it simply means "it is so that it's (A)", or "so it's (A)". Because わけ (wake)
  is a noun, it needs to follow the attributive form of the word preceding it. The nuances of "so" and
  わけ (wake) have very close parallels, ranging from "because" to simple emphasis, like with "naturally"
  and "as you'd expect". わけ (wake) can also be used in questions, implying the speaker is trying to confirm
  something they've heard. わけだね (wake da ne) "so it's (A), right?" and わけですか (wake desu ka) "so is it
  that (A)?" illustrate this.
