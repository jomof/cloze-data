grammar_point: なお①
jlpt: N2
meaning: Still, Even, Yet
details:
  Register: Formal
  使用域: 硬い
writeup: The adverb **なお** (nao), when used at the beginning of a statement, conveys the meaning of "still",
  "even", or "yet". It often appears after a previous statement that ends in **も** (mo), emphasizing that
  something remains true **even after** the condition mentioned in the first statement. This structure
  highlights a surprising or unexpected continuation despite a prior circumstance. Frequently, the second
  part of the sentence containing **なお** will also include **も** to reinforce the idea of "in addition
  to" the first point. The phrase **今もなお** (ima mo nao - still now) is a common fixed expression. While
  **今もなお** is widely used, **なお** by itself maintains a formal tone.

false_friends:
  - term: なお②
    meaning: In addition, Incidentally, Furthermore, Moreover
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「なお①」 which signifies continuation despite a previous state, 「なお②」 introduces additional,
      related information. It acts more like "by the way" or "furthermore".
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between the two meanings of 「なお」, pay attention to the
  context. 「なお①」 often appears with **も** and emphasizes a surprising continuation, while 「なお②」 typically
  introduces new but related information without this sense of continuation.
