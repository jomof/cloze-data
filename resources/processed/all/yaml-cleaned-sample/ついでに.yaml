  **ついでに** is an adverb in Japanese similar to "while you're at it" or "on the occasion of (A)" in English. The noun **ついで (序)** means "precedence," suggesting that action A comes before and enables action B. Therefore, the literal nuance of **ついでに** is like, "with (A) as the initial action, (B) as well."

  **ついでに** is generally used with verbs or nouns. When used with a noun, it needs to be preceded by the particle **の**.

  **Important Consideration:** Just like "precedence" in English, **ついでに** implies that the first action (A) is the primary reason or opportunity for the second action (B). This makes it useful for indicating something is not a primary goal but a convenient addition.

  **Caution:** While **ついでに** can describe regular occurrences, it leans towards describing "one-off" actions, making it more formal than words like **間に** or **時に**. However, it can still be used for regular actions, especially in formal or polite speech, such as when talking to a senior (senpai).

  of an event without necessarily implying the convenient addition of a secondary action.
