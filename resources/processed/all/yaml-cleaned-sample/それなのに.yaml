writeup: |-
  それなのに combines the demonstrative pronoun それ (that), the linking particle な, and the concessive particle のに (although/despite). Functioning as a conjunction, それなのに connects two sentences where the second sentence presents a situation that is unexpected or contradictory to the first. It conveys the nuance of "even though that is the case" or "despite what was just said."

  Think of it as highlighting a surprising contrast. Sentence (A) sets up an expectation, and それなのに introduces sentence (B), which defies that expectation. This often implies a sense of wonder, confusion, or even frustration at the unexpected turn of events.
examples:
  - japanese: 妻は今、風邪をひいて寝込んでいる。それなのに、いきなり動物園に行きたいと言ってきた。
    english: My wife is currently in bed with a cold. And yet, she suddenly said she wants to go to the
      zoo.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「～て寝込んでいる」 indicates a current state of illness. The sudden request 「動物園に行きたい」
      is unexpected given her condition, hence the use of 「それなのに」.
  - japanese: 私は毎日３時間日本語の勉強をしている。それなのに全然上達している感じがしない。
    english: I study Japanese for three hours every day. And yet, I don't feel like I'm improving at all.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「毎日３時間日本語の勉強をしている」 implies a significant effort, making the lack of perceived improvement
      「全然上達している感じがしない」contrary to expectation, hence 「それなのに」.
  - japanese: 私は努力していると思う。それなのに、どうしてうまくいかないのかな。
    english: I think I am putting in effort. And yet, I wonder why things aren't going well.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The speaker believes they are making an effort 「努力していると思う」, but the negative outcome 「うまくいかない」
      is contrary to what they expect, prompting the use of 「それなのに」 and the questioning 「どうして～かな」.
  - japanese: 新品を買った。それなのにもう壊れた。
    english: I bought it brand new. Despite this, it's already broken.
    register: casual
    setting: annoyed
    nuance: Buying something brand new 「新品を買った」 sets the expectation of it being in good working order.
      Its immediate breakage 「もう壊れた」 is unexpected and frustrating, hence 「それなのに」.
  - japanese: 早起きするために早く寝た。それなのに寝坊しちゃった。
    english: I went to bed early to wake up early. And yet, I overslept.
    register: casual
    setting: slightly apologetic
    nuance: Going to bed early 「早く寝た」 is a deliberate action to ensure waking up early. Oversleeping 「寝坊しちゃった」
      defeats this purpose and is an unexpected outcome, hence 「それなのに」 and the use of 「～ちゃった」 which can
      express regret or surprise.
  - japanese: アンテナを新しくしたんです。それなのにテレビの映りが悪いんですよ。
    english: I got a new antenna. Despite this, the TV picture quality is bad.
    register: polite
    setting: informative
    nuance: Replacing the antenna with a new one 「アンテナを新しくしたんです」 should ideally improve the TV picture
      quality. The poor picture quality 「テレビの映りが悪いんですよ」 is contrary to this expectation, thus 「それなのに」.
      The 「～んです」 and 「～んですよ」 add a touch of explanation or seeking understanding.
  - japanese: 一生懸命育児をしている。それなのに夫は全然手伝ってくれない。
    english: I'm giving it my all raising our child. And yet, my husband doesn't help at all.
    register: casual
    setting: frustrated
    nuance: The phrase 「一生懸命育児をしている」 highlights the speaker's significant effort in childcare. The husband's
      lack of help 「夫は全然手伝ってくれない」 is a frustrating contrast, hence 「それなのに」.
  - japanese: 昨日、散々デートに誘ったじゃない。それなのに、今日の待ち合わせ場所に来ないなんて、ひどいよ。
    english: I asked you out on a date countless times yesterday, didn't I? And yet, not showing up at
      our meeting spot today is just awful.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker emphasizes his repeated attempts to arrange the date 「散々デートに誘ったじゃない」, creating
      an expectation for the meeting to happen. The listener's absence 「今日の待ち合わせ場所に来ない」 is a direct contradiction,
      highlighted by 「それなのに」 and the reproachful 「ひどいよ」.
  - japanese: 君のこと、すごく気に入ったんだ。それなのに、連絡先を教えてくれないの? ちょっと寂しいな。
    english: I really like you. And yet, you won't give me your contact information? That's a little sad.
    register: casual
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Expressing strong positive feelings 「すごく気に入ったんだ」 typically leads to an expectation of wanting
      to connect further. Refusal to exchange contact information 「連絡先を教えてくれないの?」 goes against this, prompting
      「それなのに」 and the slightly disappointed 「ちょっと寂しいな」.
false_friends:
  - term: もっとも
    meaning: Although, But, However, For all that, Provided that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While もっとも can also express a contrast, it often introduces a qualification or exception to
      the previous statement, rather than a direct contradiction like それなのに.
  - term: それにしても
    meaning: Nevertheless, Even so
    kind: synonym
    nuance: それにしても expresses surprise or a sense of going against expectations, similar to それなのに, but
      it often carries a stronger emotional weight or a sense of resignation.
  - term: しかしながら
    meaning: However, Nevertheless, But
    kind: synonym
    nuance: However, ながら is more formal than それなのに and often used in writing or more serious contexts
      to indicate a contrast.
  - term: のに (in order to)
    meaning: Despite, Although, Even though
    kind: synonym
    nuance: The particle のに expresses regret, blame, or surprise about an outcome that is contrary to
      what was expected or intended. それなのに focuses more on the contrast between two facts.
  - term: それでも
    meaning: But still, And yet, Even so, Nevertheless
    kind: synonym
    nuance: それでも emphasizes persistence despite the previous circumstance. While similar to それなのに, it
      often implies an action taken despite the contrary situation.
  - term: ながらも
    meaning: But, Even while, Even though, Despite, Although
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ながらも implies doing one thing while another contrasting situation exists. It's more about simultaneous
      actions or states, whereas それなのに focuses on a sequence where the second contradicts the first.
  - term: くせに
    meaning: Even though, And yet, Despite
    kind: synonym
    nuance: くせに often carries a negative connotation, expressing resentment or disapproval towards the
      situation or someone's behavior. それなのに is more neutral in tone.
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like もっとも, それにしても, しかしながら, のに, それでも, ながらも, and くせに can also
  indicate contrast, it's important to note the subtle nuances that differentiate them from それなのに. それなのに
  specifically highlights a surprising or unexpected contradiction between two statements. Pay attention
  to the specific context and the emotional tone you want to convey when choosing between these similar
  expressions.
