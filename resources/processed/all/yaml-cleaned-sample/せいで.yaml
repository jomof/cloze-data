  **せいで** (所為) is used to express that a negative result occurred due to a specific reason. It carries a nuance of blame or fault. While written almost exclusively in hiragana, the kanji 所為 (shoi) literally means "doings" or "act," which helps to understand its blaming nature. You can think of it as pointing to something or someone as the cause of an undesirable outcome. Since **せい** is a noun, it follows the attributive form of verbs and adjectives. The particle **で** often follows **せい**, indicating that the negative consequence (B) happened because of the preceding cause (A).

  Etymologically, the use of "doings" to assign blame is similar to English expressions like "it was the weather's doings" or "the missing cookies were your doings!".
