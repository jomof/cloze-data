  **大体 (daitai)** is an adverb with several related meanings, all centered around the idea of something being 'general' or 'essential'. It can mean **most or mostly**, indicating the majority of something. It can also mean **adequately or generally**, implying a sufficient or typical state. When used to describe quantity or time, it translates to **roughly or approximately**. Finally, similar to そもそも, it can express **in the first place**, often used when questioning a situation that shouldn't be happening.

  Think of 大体 as capturing the core or essential aspect of something.

  **Etymology Fun Fact:** A common synonym for 大体 is **根本 (konpon)**, a noun meaning 'the source' or 'the origin'. This connection highlights how 大体 focuses on the underlying or fundamental state of something, before any specific modifications or deviations.
