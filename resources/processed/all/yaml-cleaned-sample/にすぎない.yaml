grammar_point: にすぎない
jlpt: N2
meaning: No more than, Just, Merely
details:
  Register: Formal
  使用域: 硬い
writeup: The grammar point **にすぎない** is used to express that something is **no more than** or **merely**
  a certain thing. It emphasizes the limited or insignificant nature of something. The structure is formed
  by combining the particle **に** with the negative form of the verb **過ぎる (すぎる)**, which means "to exceed"
  or "to go too far". Therefore, **にすぎない** literally means "does not exceed (that)". While considered
  somewhat formal (**硬い**), it's still frequently heard in everyday conversation. It can follow nouns,
  verbs in their dictionary form, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives. When used with a な-adjective, the な
  is typically dropped. Sometimes, **にすぎない** is used with adverbs like **ただ** (just, only) or **だけ** (only),
  which further emphasize the limited nature. When used with **だけ**, it comes between the noun/adjective/verb
  and **にすぎない**.
