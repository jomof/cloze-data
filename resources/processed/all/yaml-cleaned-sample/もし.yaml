writeup: '**もし** is an adverb that emphasizes the sense of "if," often used with conditional expressions
  like **と**, **ば**, **なら**, **たら**, and **ても**. It adds a nuance of **uncertainty** or **low probability**
  to the condition. Think of it as adding a bit of "on the off-chance" to your "if." While often written
  in hiragana, the kanji form **若し** exists, sharing a root with **若い** (young). This kanji hints at the
  core meaning of **もし**—something with a lower probability, quantity, age, or experience. To use **もし**,
  simply place it at the beginning of a clause containing one of the conditional forms mentioned above.'
etymology: The adverb もし can be written as **若し**, a kanji meaning 'low in (A)'. This is also seen in
  the word **若い** (wakai - young). The meaning of **もし** stems from this kanji, suggesting 'while low
  in (probability, number, age, experience)'.

  want to emphasize the hypothetical nature even further, consider using **もしも**. For concessions, opt
  for **ても** or the stronger **たとえ～ても**.
