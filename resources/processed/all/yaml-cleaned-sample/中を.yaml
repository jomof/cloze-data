  The grammar point **中を (なかを)** combines the noun **中 (なか)** meaning "inside" with the particle **を**, which here indicates the location where an action takes place. This structure translates to actions performed "in," "on," "into," or "inside of" a specified location. The noun preceding **中を** denotes the place, while the verb following it describes the action occurring there.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While **中を** literally means "inside of," the action doesn't always require physical presence within the noun. For instance, with verbs like **覗く (のぞく)** "to peer," the action is directed *into* the space.
  *  This grammar point is versatile and can cover various scenarios where an action takes place within a defined area.
