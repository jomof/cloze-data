writeup: '**ぬ** is the attributive form of **ず**, a classical auxiliary verb that is used for negation,
  similar to **ない**, and connects to verbs in the same way. As **ぬ** is the attributive form of **ず**,
  it may be seen modifying nouns that directly follow it. However, this use is not common in modern times,
  and in many cases it will be used as part of **set expressions** that have not changed since **ない**
  became the far more widely used structure for negation. Alternatively, it may just be used for artistic
  expression, or to make a character seem "classical". When negating the verb **いる**, the old-fashioned
  **おる** will be modified to **おらぬ** instead. Similarly, **する** will be negated as **せぬ**, and **くる**
  will be negated as **こぬ**. This is consistent with the standard conjugation patterns seen with the use
  of **ず**.'
