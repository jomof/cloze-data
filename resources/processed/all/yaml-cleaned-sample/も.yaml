writeup: も can mean "too/also", "even", or "neither/either", depending on whether the sentence is affirmative
  or negative. Multiple meanings like this are quite common for Japanese particles, as there is no need
  to use different words simply to agree with other statements in the sentence (unlike English). As you
  can see here, English requires "either/neither (when negative)", or "too/also", but Japanese only requires
  も. You can think of it as simply meaning "Whatever is true for (A), is also true for (B)". も is part
  of many other compound grammar structures in which it keeps its original meaning but shifts the nuance
  a little bit. Some of these include でも, にも～ない, and とも. As we can see, it is frequently paired with other
  particles! Here, も can be seen pairing with で. This suggests that "With (A), (B) also". This is regularly
  translated simply as "but" in English, despite the nuance being closer to "and also".

  'A and B', whereas 「も」 adds something about a previously mentioned subject, meaning 'also' or 'too'.
