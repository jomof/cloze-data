writeup: |-
  といった is a fairly casual expression which indicates examples, similar to structures like などの or のような. It comes from と and the past tense of the verb 言う (iu), so it literally means "something like said". といった is often translated as "(B) such as (A)" or "(B) like (A)". It's always followed by a noun representing a broader category (A), of which the preceding noun (B) is an example. The literal sense is akin to "(B), which can be described as (A)". Both (A) and (B) will be nouns.

  *  When listing multiple examples (B), you can use particles like や or とか, as demonstrated in some examples.

post_false_friends_writeup: While 「なんか・なんて」, 「とか～とか」, and 「など」 all serve similar purposes to 「といった」 in
  listing examples, 「なんか・なんて」 can have an additional nuance of emphasis or downplaying something. 「とか～とか」
  is specifically for listing multiple non-exhaustive examples. 「など」 is a more formal way to indicate
  'and so on'. When choosing between them, consider the formality of the situation and whether you want
  to imply that the list is not complete.
