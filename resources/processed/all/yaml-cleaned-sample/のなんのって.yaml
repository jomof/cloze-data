  **のなんのって** is a casual phrase used in spoken Japanese to emphasize the degree of something. It indicates that the word or phrase preceding it is "excessively (A)" or "extremely (A)". This structure combines the case marking particle **の**, the pre-noun adjectival **何の** (what kind of), and **って**, which is an abbreviation of **という** (to say). The literal nuance of "and to say it's (A) or something" highlights that the characteristic is so strong that the speaker struggles to describe it otherwise.

  This grammar point commonly follows:
  *  い-Adjectives
  *  な-Adjectives + **な**
  *  Verbs (dictionary form)

  **のなんのって** is a more concise version of **～の～ないのって**, which carries the same meaning. The longer form literally means "to say it's (A) or not (A), (B)", where (B) usually explains the extent of (A). Sometimes, (B) is omitted, as **～の～ないのって** itself strongly implies "extremely (A)".
