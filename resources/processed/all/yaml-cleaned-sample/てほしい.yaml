  Remember how we learned to express wanting something for yourself using 「がほしい」? Well, 「ほしい」 can also act like an auxiliary adjective. This means it needs to attach to something else to make sense. When it follows the 「て」-form of a verb, it becomes 「てほしい」, and it expresses what the speaker **wants someone else to do**. So, if you want to say "I want you to do something," you take the verb you want them to do, change it to its 「て」-form, and then add 「ほしい」.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  「てほしい」 can also be used to ask questions about what someone wants you to do, or to explain what someone else wants another person to do. Pay close attention to the context to understand who wants whom to do what.

post_example_writeup: Remember that the politeness level of 「てほしい」 can be adjusted by adding 「です」 to the
  end, making it 「てほしいです」. This makes the request sound more polite and is generally recommended when
  speaking to people you aren't close to or when in more formal situations.

      own desire to do something. For example, 「私は映画を見たい」 (I want to watch a movie).
  - term: がほしい
    meaning: To want something, To be in need of
    kind: synonym

  - term: たがる
    meaning: To want to (Third person)
    kind: synonym

    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「がる」 is used to describe someone else's feelings or desires, often observable through their
      actions or expressions. It's more nuanced than a direct statement of wanting. For example, 「怖がる」
      (to be afraid).
  - term: ように～てほしい
    meaning: Want ~ to ~ like ~, Want ~ to be able to ~, Want ~ to ~ in the way of ~
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ように～てほしい」 adds a nuance of expectation or manner to the request. It specifies *how* you want
      someone to do something. For example, 「もっと丁寧に説明してほしい」 (I want you to explain more carefully).
post_false_friends_writeup: The key difference to remember is that 「てほしい」 is specifically for expressing
  your desire for someone else to perform an action. 「たい」 and 「がほしい」 are for your own desires (actions
  and things, respectively), while 「たがる」 and 「がる」 describe the desires of others. 「ように～てほしい」 adds a specific
  manner to your request.
