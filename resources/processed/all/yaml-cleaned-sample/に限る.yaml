writeup: |-
  「に限る」 combines the case-marking particle 「に」 (marking a location or situation) and the verb 「限る」 (to limit). This expression conveys the idea that "there's nothing better than A" or "there's nothing like A." 「に限る」 can be used with verbs in their dictionary form or with nouns.

  It can also appear with verbs negated using the auxiliary verb 「ない」. In such cases, it expresses that "there is nothing better than *not* doing A."

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  When used with a verb, it typically suggests the **best way** to handle a situation or what brings the most satisfaction.
  *  When used with a noun, it often implies that **only** that particular thing is suitable or allowed in a certain context.

  **Etymology:**

  The literal meaning of 「限る」 is 「境を付ける」 (sakai o tsukeru), meaning "to set a boundary." The 「に」 marks the location or situation within which the speaker identifies something as being "the boundary"—the best option or the only acceptable one. This is why translations like "to be bound to" or "to be limited to" are also possible for 「に限る」.
