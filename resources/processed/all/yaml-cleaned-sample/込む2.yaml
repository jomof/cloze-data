writeup: The verb suffix 「込む (こむ)」, written with the kanji for "to be crowded," attaches to the conjunctive
  form (連用形) of other verbs. It conveys the idea of doing something **thoroughly, deeply, or intensely**,
  or remaining in a certain state. Think of it as "jamming into" an action or state, making it more profound
  or prolonged. It implies an action that is not easily entered, nor easily escaped from. This lesson
  focuses on the meanings of **remaining in a state** or doing something **thoroughly/deeply/intensely**.

false_friends:
  - term: 切る
    meaning: To do something completely to the end, Utterly, Resolutely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「込む」, 「切る」 emphasizes the completion or finality of an action, often with a sense of
      decisiveness, rather than the depth or intensity of it.
  - term: 込む ①
    meaning: To go into, To put into
    kind: homonym
    nuance: This is the basic meaning of 「込む」 as a standalone verb, indicating physical entry. The suffix
      「込む」 in this lesson adds a nuance of depth or intensity.
  - term: おわる
    meaning: To finish, To end
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While some actions done 'thoroughly' might lead to their end, 「おわる」 simply focuses on the
      completion of the action without emphasizing the depth or intensity involved as 「込む」 does.
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse the suffix 「込む」 with the standalone verb 「込む」 meaning
  'to enter'. Also, while 「切る」 and 「おわる」 might describe the result of an action done intensely, they don't
  capture the feeling of being deeply involved in the action itself that 「込む」 provides.
