  When following the **past-tense form of a verb**, the conjunction particle なり indicates something existing in an ongoing state, similar to **まま**. This can be translated as "while (A)", or "remaining (A)". Because ～たなり sentences usually describe something happening *while* in the state of (A), they are often followed directly by a comma, or by the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb だ, で. The (B) phrase then describes what is happening during (A). ～たなり is primarily used to express an **undesirable state** continuing despite (A) having happened, although this is not a strict rule.

  Since ～たなり indicates that (A) is something that continues to stay in the same state, it often carries the nuance of "ever since (A)" in situations where a significant amount of time has passed.

  **Important Consideration:** This なり derives from the noun 形 "shape" in its hiragana form, and is different from the なり that is used as the classic copula.

  a certain action. It can carry a sense of something being left as it is, sometimes with a negative or
  undesirable implication.
false_friends:
  - term: ままに (as desired)
    meaning: As is, While remaining, Left in a state
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「たなり・なり」, 「ままに」 often implies doing something as one pleases or according to a certain
      condition. It doesn't necessarily carry the same nuance of something being left in a particular
      state since a past action.
  - term: きり
    meaning: Only, Just, Since
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「きり」 can also mean "since" when used with a past tense verb, it focuses more on the
      point in time when something started and the absence of further occurrences. 「たなり・なり」 emphasizes
      the continuation of a state *resulting* from that past action.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing these grammar points, remember that 「たなり・なり」 specifically
  describes a state of affairs *after* a past action, implying that things have remained unchanged since
  then. 「ままに」 emphasizes doing something as one wants or something being in a certain condition, and 「きり」
  focuses on a singular event or a starting point in time.
