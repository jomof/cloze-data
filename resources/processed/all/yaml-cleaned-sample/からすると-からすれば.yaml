  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
writeup: 「からすると」is an expression that combines the particle 「から」 meaning "from", the verb 「する」 "to do",
  and the conditional particle 「と」. 「からすれば」 is a similar construction using the conditional 「ば」 instead
  of 「と」. Both translate to "judging from (A), (B)" or "considering (A), (B)". The 「する」 in this context
  acts similarly to "going off" in English, indicating that the preceding noun or clause (A) is the basis
  for the speaker's subsequent judgment or assessment (B). You'll find 「からすると」 or 「からすれば」 immediately
  after the subject being evaluated. It's interesting to note that when 「する」 is combined with conditional
  forms like 「と」, 「ば」, or 「たら」, it often implies that the speaker is proceeding with the assumption that
  (A) is true.
