  The grammar point 「ゆえに」 is a formal way to express a reason or cause, similar to "because of," "due to," or "therefore." It often emphasizes the logical consequence of a situation. The noun 「故 (ゆえ)」 meaning "reason" or "cause" is combined with the case-marking particle 「に」.

  Here are some key points:

  *  When 「ゆえに」 follows a noun directly, it requires the particle 「の」 between the noun and 「ゆえに」 (e.g., 「女性のゆえに」).
  *  In other cases, 「ゆえに」 attaches directly to the standard form of a word (e.g., a verb in its dictionary form or a noun directly).
  *  「ゆえに」 can also start a new sentence, functioning like "therefore" or "as a result." In this case, it refers back to the entire preceding sentence.
  *  **Important Consideration:** 「ゆえに」 is predominantly used for negative reasons or consequences, similar to how "as a consequence of" is often used in English.
