writeup: |-
  まじき is the attributive form of まじ, a classical auxiliary verb that has been replaced almost entirely by まい "must not", "should not" in modern Japanese. まじ itself has this same meaning of "must not", and will only be seen in a very limited number of formal expressions. Although slightly different in nuance, まじき is often translated simply as "not proper for (A)", or "unbecoming of (A)" in each case. The most common pattern that まじき will be seen in is (A)にあるまじき(B), where the case-marking particle に follows a noun, then is linked to the う-Verb ある, before まじき will connect to a second noun. Occasionally, に will be replaced by として "as", with the rest of the structure remaining the same. **Important patterns to note:**

  *  **(A)にあるまじき(B)**: "(B) unbecoming of (A)"
  *  **(A)としてあるまじき(B)**: "(B) unbecoming of (A) as a/an (A)"
  *  **許すまじき**: "must not be forgiven", or simply "unforgivable".
