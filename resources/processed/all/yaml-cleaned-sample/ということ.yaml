writeup: One of the ways to perform nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun) in Japanese is through
  the use of the expression こと. Adding 「という」 before 「こと」 further clarifies the content being nominalized.
  This grammar point is a combination of と (the particle), 言う (the verb, meaning "to say"), and こと (the
  noun, meaning "thing" or "matter"). Together, the literal sense is close to "the thing that is said".
  However, in practice, it functions to express the **result, conclusion, or interpretation of something**.
  To use 「ということ」, attach it to the end of any **plain form** phrase (without です or ます). In most cases,
  it will be written using hiragana. In conversation, 「という」 is regularly shortened to simply 「って」. This
  form will be heard/seen much more frequently in casual conversation and manga. 「ということ」 is also frequently
  used when clarifying what someone else has said. In these cases, it translates very similarly to "you
  mean that (A)?", or "you mean to say that (A)?"
examples:
  - japanese: 宇宙人はいるということですか?
    english: Does that mean aliens exist?
    register: semi-formal
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: The 「か」 at the end of the sentence makes it a question.
  - japanese: 一緒に住んでいるけど付き合ってはいないの?ルームメイトだということだよね?
    english: You are living together, but not dating? So that means they're your roommate, right?

  - japanese: これが正しいってことですか?
    english: Does that mean that this is correct?

      it a question.

    english: Your car broke? Does that mean you are coming by train? Please don't be late.

      come".

    english: You mean that this is man-made? Wow, I had no idea.

    speaker_gender: male

    nuance: The phrase 「こうして一緒にいられる」 expresses the current situation. 「かもしれないね」 softens the statement,
      making it less assertive and more suitable for a first-date setting.

  The shortened form 「ってこと」 is very common in everyday conversation. Pay attention to the context to determine
  the nuance - whether it's a confirmation, a deduction, or a restatement.
