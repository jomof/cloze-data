writeup: |-
  ませんか (pronounced "masen ka") is a polite sentence-ending expression used after verbs to make an invitation. It translates to phrases like "Won't you do... (with me)?" or "Why don't we do...?" It's a direct way of inviting someone to do something together.

  While similar to ましょうか (mashou ka), which suggests "Shall we do...?", ませんか is more directly inviting. Imagine you're asking, "Wouldn't you mind doing (A) with me?" This inherent politeness makes ませんか a preferable choice when inviting someone, especially if you're not very close to them.

  Using ないか (nai ka) instead is possible but considered very casual and not grammatically standard. It's best to stick with ませんか for politeness.

  To further emphasize the idea of doing something 'together', it's common to add expressions like 一緒に (issho ni), meaning "together".

false_friends:
  - term: たらどう
    meaning: Why don't you...?, What if you did...?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ませんか, たらどう is used to offer suggestions or ask for opinions about someone else's actions,
      not to invite them to do something with you.
  - term: ましょう
    meaning: Let's, Shall we (Polite volitional)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ませんか, ましょう expresses the speaker's intention to do something, often including the listener,
      but it's more of a suggestion or declaration than a direct invitation.
  - term: ～ましょうか
    meaning: Shall we, Shall I
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ませんか, ましょうか is used to offer help or make a suggestion, often phrasing it as a question
      of whether the listener wants to do something or wants the speaker to do something.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that ませんか is specifically for inviting someone
  to do something together. たらどう focuses on suggestions for others. ましょう is about stating intent or making
  a general suggestion. ましょうか is for offering help or suggesting an action, often seeking confirmation
  or agreement.
