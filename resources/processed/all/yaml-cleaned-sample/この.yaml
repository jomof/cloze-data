writeup: この is classified as a "pre-noun adjectival" in Japanese, also known as a 連体詞 (rentaishi). These
  words **always precede a noun** and directly modify it, indicating that the noun is close to the speaker.
  Think of it as pointing to something within your immediate vicinity. It belongs to the same group of
  demonstrative words as これ (this one), ここ (here), それ (that one, near you), そこ (there, near you), あれ (that
  one over there), and あそこ (over there). Unlike adjectives (い-adjectives and な-adjectives), 連体詞 do not
  conjugate; they retain their form regardless of the tense or politeness level of the sentence.

  but refer to things further away from the speaker. どの is used for asking questions.
