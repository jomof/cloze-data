  使用域: 一般
writeup: にしてみれば, usually written completely in hiragana, is an expression used when the speaker is making
  a hypothetical statement about how something may appear from the point of view of another. It will often
  be translated as "from the point of view of (A), (B)", "in the case of (A), (B)", or simply "for (A),
  (B)". Literally, the meaning is "assuming that I was (A) and then looking from there, (B)". にしてみれば will
  appear after nouns that represent a person, or organizations representative of people. It is a combination
  of the case-marking particle に, the て-form of する, and the hypothetical form of 見る, 見れば. As にしてみれば will
  exclusively follow words that indicate a person or a group of people, the (B) part of the phrase will
  usually discuss how the speaker assumes that they would feel given the situation. Because of this assumption,
  these sentences often finish with だろう, でしょう, かもしれない, and other similar structures.
