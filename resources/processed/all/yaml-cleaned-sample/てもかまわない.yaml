  「てもかまわない」 is often used to express that something "doesn't matter", or that the speaker "doesn't mind". This structure combines the 「て」-form of a verb or an い-adjective, or 「で」 with nouns and な-adjectives, with the negative conjugation of the う-verb 「構う」, which means "to care" or "to mind". Literally, this expression can be thought of as being similar to "not caring" or "not being concerned". It is almost always used to convey that there is no issue with something. 「てもかまわない」 may be used with any type of word that appears in its 「て」-form or 「で」 form.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  「構う」 usually translates as "to care", "to mind", or "to be concerned".
  *  The kanji 「構」 often has the nuance of "to take a posture" or "to prepare oneself", sometimes implying a defensive stance. In the 「ても構わない」 grammar structure, this translates to (A) simply being something that will not cause the speaker to "take a stance" or be bothered by it.

false_friends:
  - term: Verb + てもいい
    meaning: It's okay to, It's alright to, Can/may
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both 「てもかまわない」 and 「てもいい」 express permission or lack of objection, 「てもいい」 focuses more
      on giving permission or stating that something is acceptable, whereas 「てもかまわない」 emphasizes that
      the speaker personally doesn't mind.
  - term: てもいい
    meaning: It is alright/fine/okay even if, Can/may, ~ is also okay
    kind: synonym
    nuance: In the sense of "even if", 「てもいい」 can sometimes be interchangeable with 「てもかまわない」, but 「てもかまわない」
      more directly expresses the speaker's lack of concern. For instance, 「雨が降ってもいいです」 means "It's okay
      if it rains," implying acceptance, while 「雨が降っても構いません」 means "I don't mind if it rains," focusing
      on the speaker's personal feeling.
  - term: でよければ
    meaning: If it is alright, If you don't mind, If you would like, If possible
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「でよければ」 is used when offering something or suggesting an option, implying a willingness to
      accommodate the listener's preferences. It translates to "if it's okay with you" or "if you're alright
      with it." Unlike 「てもかまわない」, it's more about seeking confirmation or offering a potentially less-than-ideal
      option politely. For example, 「私のでよければ、貸しますよ」 means "If mine is okay with you, I'll lend it to you."
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「てもかまわない」 with similar expressions, remember that 「てもいい」
  often focuses on permission or general acceptability, while 「てもかまわない」 specifically highlights the speaker's
  lack of objection or concern. 「でよければ」 is used when offering something or suggesting an option while
  being considerate of the listener's preferences. Pay attention to the nuance of whether you are granting
  permission, expressing your own feelings, or offering something conditionally.
