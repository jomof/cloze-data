  In Japanese, to describe a noun with a **な-adjective**, you simply place the な-adjective followed by the particle 「な」 directly before the noun. Think of it as saying the adjective **is** a quality of the noun. For example, if you want to say "a quiet town", 「静かな」 (shizuka na - quiet) describes the quality of 「街」 (machi - town), resulting in 「静かな街」.

  **Important Considerations:**

  While な-adjectives use 「な」 before nouns, **の-adjectives** (also known as adjectival nouns) use 「の」. Understanding the difference is key. Generally:

  *  **な (na):** Emphasizes a quality or characteristic of the noun.
  *  **の (no):** Often indicates possession, belonging, or categorization.

  Consider these contrasting examples:

  *  「**きれいな** 花」 (kirei **na** hana): A **beautiful** flower. (Focus is on the quality of being beautiful.)
  *  「**木**の 花」 (ki **no** hana): A flower **of a tree**. (Indicates the type or origin of the flower.)

  Being mindful of this distinction will help you use な-adjectives correctly to describe nouns.
