etymology: そういえば is derived from そう ("that way", "like that") and 言えば (the conditional ば-form of the verb
  言う "to say"). Literally, it means "if one says that".
writeup: |-
  **そういえば** is used to introduce a topic that the speaker has just thought of, often prompted by something mentioned earlier in the conversation or a sudden realization. It translates to phrases like "speaking of which," "by the way," or "come to think of it."

  Key points about **そういえば**:

  *  It acts as a discourse marker, signaling a shift to a related but often new, remembered topic.
  *  It often implies a connection, however slight, to the preceding conversation. It's not generally used to abruptly switch to a completely unrelated subject like the English phrase "by the way" can be.
  *  It consists of **そう** (like that) and **言えば** (if you say). So the literal meaning hints at the idea of "if you mention that...".
  *  It's similar in function to **といえば**, where **そう** replaces a direct quote. Both phrases indicate a connection to a previous topic.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While it shares some overlap with "by the way" in English, be mindful that **そういえば** usually has a clearer link to the preceding context than a typical "by the way" might.
  *  Think of it as a gentle pivot, acknowledging the current flow of conversation while introducing something newly recalled.

false_friends:
  - term: ところで
    meaning: By the way, Incidentally
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「そういえば」, 「ところで」 can be used to introduce a completely new and unrelated topic, offering
      a more abrupt shift in conversation.
  - term: といえば
    meaning: Speaking of, If it were the case that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「といえば」 is closer to "speaking of" and directly references the previously mentioned topic.
      「そういえば」 implies more of a spontaneous recollection or a thought triggered by the previous topic,
      rather than a direct reference to it.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「ところで」 is your go-to for changing the subject
  entirely. 「といえば」 is for directly referencing something just said. 「そういえば」 falls in between, suggesting
  a connection but introducing a slightly new thought prompted by the earlier conversation.
