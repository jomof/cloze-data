  **思うように (omou you ni)** is a common Japanese expression that describes situations where things happen or don't happen according to one's expectations or desires. It literally translates to "like one thinks/hopes." This grammar point is formed by combining the verb **思う (omou)**, meaning "to think" or "to feel," with **ように (you ni)**, which indicates "in a way that" or "like."

  The basic structure is often:

  **(A) Expectation/Intention + 思うように + (B) Outcome**

  Part (A) sets up the desired or anticipated scenario, and part (B) describes the actual result. The outcome in (B) can either match the expectation, or, more commonly, it does not. Therefore, you'll often see 思うように used with negative verb forms in the (B) part of the sentence.

  * **Positive Usage:** When the outcome matches expectations.
  * **Negative Usage:** When the outcome doesn't match expectations (this is more frequent).

  When the outcome (B) is a noun, you'll use **思うような (omou you na)** instead of 思うように.
