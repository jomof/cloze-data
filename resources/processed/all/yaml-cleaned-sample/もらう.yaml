writeup: |-
  **もらう** is the third verb that is regularly taught together with **くれる** and **あげる**. It's used to indicate that someone **receives** something. However, unlike **くれる** and **あげる** (which highlight that something is **given**), **もらう** uses the particles **に** (or **から**) to mark the giver, not the receiver.

  The receiver is typically marked with **は** or **が**, as they are the subject performing the action of receiving. The direct object being received is marked with **を**.

  Sometimes, the receiver or the giver can be omitted if the context is clear. For instance, in the example 「明後日給料をもらいます。」, the receiver (**I**) is implied. Similarly, the giver might be omitted when the focus is on the received object.

  For simple sentences with obvious context, both the giver and receiver might be omitted, focusing solely on the act of receiving the object.

  - term: てもらう
    meaning: To get someone to do, To have someone do
    kind: grammatical structure
    nuance: Unlike 「もらう」 which focuses on receiving an object, 「てもらう」 focuses on receiving an action.
      For example, 「友達に手伝ってもらった」 (I had my friend help me).
  - term: くれる
    meaning: To give (me), To be given
    kind: verb
    nuance: Unlike 「もらう」 where the speaker is the receiver, 「くれる」 indicates someone gives something to
      the speaker or someone close to the speaker. The giver is the subject.
  - term: あげる
    meaning: To give (away), To present, To provide
    kind: verb
    nuance: Unlike 「もらう」, 「あげる」 indicates the speaker or someone close to the speaker is the giver. The
      giver is the subject, and the receiver is marked by 「に」.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up these similar expressions, remember that **もらう** focuses
  on the action of receiving from someone, with the receiver as the subject and the giver marked by **に**
  or **から**. **くれる** focuses on someone giving something *to you* or someone close to you. **あげる** focuses
  on *you* giving something to someone else.
