  たら最後 and たが最後 are grammar structures that both convey the idea of "once (A), definitely (B)". The (B) part of the sentence typically describes a negative consequence that is considered inevitable once the action in (A) occurs. These expressions can be translated as "once (A), (B)", "now that (A), (B)", or "as soon as (A), (B)".

  Both たら and が function as conjunction particles here. たら carries its usual meaning of "if" or "when", while が has a meaning closer to "once (something happens)" in this context. So, たが最後 implies "(A) happens, and as a result, inevitably (B) will follow", while たら最後 means "when (A) happens, (B) will inevitably follow". Despite this slight nuance, they are often used interchangeably.

  The word 最後 (saigo - the end, the last) logically connects to the (B) part of the sentence, emphasizing that the described negative outcome is the "final state" or inevitable conclusion.

  **Important Consideration:** Sometimes, the (B) part of the sentence might be omitted if the negative consequence is quite obvious from the context.
