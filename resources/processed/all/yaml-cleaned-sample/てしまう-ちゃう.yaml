writeup: |-
  By combining the conjunction particle て, with the verb しまう (sometimes written as 終う), you are able to express that something was done "by accident", "completely", or "unfortunately". These meanings may seem quite different, but they share a core nuance of **finality or completion**, often with a sense of no turning back. Let's look at a few examples of てしまう first.

  As we can see, verbs that usually take で instead of て will be no different when using てしまう. Sometimes, てしまう or でしまう will be shortened to more casual forms, often used in speech. These forms are as follows:

  *  てしまう will become ちゃう
  *  でしまう will become じゃう

  **Fun Fact:** While て終う is most frequently written in hiragana, て仕舞う may also be seen. There is a slight nuance difference between these two kanji structures, but the primary meaning of しまう will always be that "something has come to the point where ending/ending up in a specific state cannot be avoided". This "no turning back point" may be temporary (likely to be written as 仕舞う), or it may be permanent (likely to be written as 終う).

  Due to this "cannot be avoided" nuance, しまう often comes across as "totally", as in "ah… I totally left the chicken in the oven for too long". In these cases, it is simply expressing the speaker's exasperation that something is "too late" to change. However, despite regularly being used negatively, てしまう can also be used positively. In these cases, it still has the nuance of "no turning back", indicating a firm decision or completion.

false_friends:
  - term: はじめる
    meaning: To start, To begin to
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「てしまう・ちゃう」, 「はじめる」 indicates the commencement of an action, not its completion or an
      accidental outcome.
  - term: 切れない
    meaning: Being unable to finish or complete
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「てしまう・ちゃう」, 「切れない」 expresses the inability to finish something, the opposite of completion.
  - term: おわる
    meaning: To finish, To end
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「てしまう・ちゃう」 in its "to finish" meaning, but 「おわる」 is a more straightforward expression
      of completion without the added nuance of accident or regret.
  - term: 切る
    meaning: To do something completely to the end, Utterly, Resolutely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「切る」 can also mean doing something completely, it often carries a stronger sense of
      intention or resoluteness, unlike the accidental or regrettable nuances of 「てしまう・ちゃう」.
  - term: 上がる・上げる
    meaning: Something is finished, To finish something, Something has come to an end, To do something
      completely, To do something through
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「てしまう・ちゃう」 in the sense of completion, but 「上がる・上げる」 often implies a more deliberate
      action of finishing something, lacking the accidental or unfortunate nuance.
  - term: つい
    meaning: Accidentally, Unconsciously, Against one's better judgement
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Like one use of 「てしまう・ちゃう」, 「つい」 expresses doing something accidentally. However, 「つい」 is
      an adverb that directly modifies the verb, while 「てしまう」 is a verb compound.
post_false_friends_writeup: While some of these expressions share a similar meaning of completion or accident
  with 「てしまう・ちゃう」, it's important to note the subtle differences. 「おわる」 and 「上がる・上げる」 are generally more
  straightforward ways to say something finished. 「切る」 implies a deliberate and resolute completion. 「はじめる」
  and 「切れない」 represent the opposite - starting or not being able to finish. 「つい」 focuses specifically
  on the accidental nature of an action but is used differently grammatically.
