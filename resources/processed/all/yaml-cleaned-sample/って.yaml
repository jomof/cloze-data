writeup: って is a casual variation of the particle と that is used for quoting something. This use is called
  引用 (in'you) in Japanese, which basically translates to "reference" or "citation". って is almost exclusively
  used after direct quotations and is followed by a verb indicating the type of communication, such as
  言う (iu - to say), 思う (omou - to think), or 聞く (kiku - to hear/ask). Just like with と, the verb that
  comes after って is frequently omitted, which is even more common with って due to the nature of casual
  language where many elements are implied. **Important Consideration:** While often heard, because って
  is very casual, it can sound unnatural in sentences using the polite です or ます forms. However, in a formal
  but friendly conversation, like between a senior (senpai) and junior (kouhai), using って is generally
  considered normal.

      and can have a flirtatious undertone depending on the context.
  - japanese: 彼は「晩ごはん、もう食べた」って。
    english: He's like, "I already ate dinner."
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The omission of the verb 「言った」 is very common with 「って」 in casual speech, creating a very
      informal and almost conversational feeling, like summarizing what someone said.
post_example_writeup: Notice how the verbs of saying (like 言う and 聞く) are often omitted after って in very
  casual conversation. This makes the sentence feel more concise and informal.
false_friends:
  - term: と (quotation)
    meaning: Quotation
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike って, と is a more neutral quotation marker and can be used in both casual and formal
      speech.
  - term: といってもいい
    meaning: You could say, You might say
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike って, which directly quotes, といってもいい introduces a statement that is a possible interpretation
      or way of describing something.
  - term: んだって
    meaning: I heard that, He or She said that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike って, which directly quotes, んだって conveys information that the speaker heard indirectly,
      adding a nuance of hearsay.
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse the direct quotation marker って with expressions
  like といってもいい and んだって. While they might seem similar, といってもいい is used for suggesting a way of putting
  something, and んだって indicates that information was received indirectly.
