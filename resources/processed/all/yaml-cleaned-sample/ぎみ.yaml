writeup: Coming from the noun **気味 (きみ)** meaning "sensation," **ぎみ** is a suffix that conveys weak signs
  or a tendency towards something. It's attached to nouns or the ます-stem of verbs. Think of it as adding
  a nuance of "a touch of," "feeling a little," or "slightly." For example, if you say 「疲れ気味 (つかれぎみ)」,
  it means you're "feeling a little tired." **Important Considerations:** **ぎみ** refers to the subjective
  feeling or appearance perceived by the speaker. It often softens a statement, making it less definitive.
  Be careful not to confuse it with the noun **気味 (きみ)**; the suffix always uses the voiced sound **ぎ**.

post_false_friends_writeup: While 「的」, 「ような気がする」, 「っぽい」, and 「げ」 can sometimes express similar ideas to
  「ぎみ」, it's important to understand their nuances. 「ぎみ」 specifically indicates a slight or weak state
  or feeling, often subjective. The others have broader uses, focusing on characteristics, stronger feelings,
  or outward appearances.
