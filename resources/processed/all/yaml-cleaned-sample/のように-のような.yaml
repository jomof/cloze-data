  The auxiliary verb **ようだ** is used for making observations. It states that something is "in the manner/way of (A)". Like the auxiliary verb **そうだ**, **ようだ** may be used in a similar way to な-Adjectives (can be followed by な when acting as an adjective, or に when acting as an adverb). **の** is required before these constructions when it is describing a noun.

  Because **よう** (coming from the kanji 様) usually expresses the "manner" in which something is existing/happening, it is regularly used when the speaker has direct personal experience from which they are drawing a comparison. This means that **よう** will sound far more confident than **みたい**, or **そう**.

  **Fun Fact:** When **ようだ** is describing another word (in its ような, or ように form), this is known as "presenting an example" (例示 in Japanese), and means that "(A) is an example of (B)".

  is used for making direct comparisons based on perceived similarities or the manner of something, often
  drawn from personal experience. Expressions like 「そう」 and 「にみえる」 focus more on appearances or impressions,
  while 「みたい」 is more casual. 「ふうに」 emphasizes the style or manner.
