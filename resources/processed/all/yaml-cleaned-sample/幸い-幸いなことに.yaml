  - term: ことに
    meaning: Extremely, Especially, To my ...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While **幸いなことに** includes **ことに**, the standalone **ことに** has a broader range of meanings,
      expressing strong emotion (positive or negative) about something. Unlike **幸い・幸いなことに**, which specifically
      focuses on a lucky outcome, **ことに** can introduce surprising, delightful, or even regrettable facts,
      as seen in examples like 「嬉しいことに」(to my delight) or 「悲しいことに」(sadly).
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that while **幸いなことに** incorporates the element
  of strong feeling from **ことに**, it is specifically limited to expressing a positive, fortunate outcome.
  If you want to express other strong emotions, such as sadness or joy, without focusing on luck, use
  **ことに** with appropriate adjectives like **嬉しい (ureshii)** or **悲しい (kanashii)**.
