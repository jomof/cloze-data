writeup: |-
  **ことになる** is an expression that combines the nominalizing use of **こと** (creating a noun-phrase), with the case marking particle **に**, and the う-Verb **なる** "to become". This expression can be translated as "to become (A)", but has the nuance that someone/thing caused (A) to become that way. Due to this, it may also be translated as "it has been decided that (A)", or "it will end up being (A)". **ことになる** is primarily used with verbs and い-Adjectives in their attributive form. It may also be used with な-Adjectives followed by な. The "it has been decided that (A)" meaning only applies to verbs, as only verbs will be enacted by someone/thing.

  **Fun Fact:**
  This structure is a good example of why **なる** is often viewed as the intransitive form of **する**. **する** conveys that someone is performing an action (transitive), while **なる** implies that something is the result of an action (intransitive). This is why the (A) phrase in **ことになる** is usually determined to have been decided/performed by someone else, while still focusing on exactly "what" (A) became.
