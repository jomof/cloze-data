writeup: 「それとも」 is a conjunction in Japanese that translates to "or", "or else", or "rather". It is used
  to present alternative options or choices between two specific things, (A) or (B). The structure implies
  that the selection is limited to these two possibilities. 「それとも」 is formed by combining 「それ」 (that),
  the particle 「と」 (and), and the particle 「も」 (also/too). This grammar point typically appears after
  a comma or at the beginning of a new sentence presenting the second option. While the options presented
  by 「それとも」 are often opposites, this is not a strict requirement.

  - japanese: 今日は文法の勉強をしますか、それとも漢字の勉強をしますか。
    english: Will you study grammar today, or will you study kanji?

      the second choice.

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「ねえ」 signals a familiar and slightly suggestive tone. The ellipsis and “もっと面白いこと、する?” 「motto

      a movie. 「それとも」 sets up the alternative, leaving room for imagination.
false_friends:
  - term: か (question)
    meaning: Or
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「か」 can also mean "or" when listing options in a question, it is used at the end of
      each option, whereas 「それとも」 connects the two distinct options.
  - term: むしろ
    meaning: Rather, Instead, Over
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「むしろ」 also means "rather", but it implies a stronger preference for the second option over
      the first, whereas 「それとも」 presents the options more neutrally for selection.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「か」 is used to list potential options within
  a question, while 「それとも」 specifically connects two mutually exclusive choices. 「むしろ」 expresses a preference,
  making it distinct from the neutral presentation of 「それとも」.
