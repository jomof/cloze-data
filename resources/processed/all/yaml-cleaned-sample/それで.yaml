  Like それに, それで is another conjunction that is regularly considered to be one word in Japanese, but is more correctly just a combination of the pronoun それ, and the case marking particle で. The thing that それ is 'substituting' for is the entire clause/sentence that came before it, while で highlights that 'with that', or 'by means of that'. In this way, it translates to 'therefore', 'because of that', or 'with that' where 'that' is the previous information. それで is frequently used at the beginning of a second sentence, to highlight the information from the first.

  **Important Considerations**
  You may also see それでは. で in this case is the conjunctive form of だ (the auxiliary verb). Due to this, the meaning is closer to 'well then', 'in that case', or 'if so'. This では is also frequently shortened to じゃ.

  - term: そのため(に)
    meaning: For that reason, Because of that, To that end
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both それで and そのため(に) indicate a causal relationship, そのため(に) tends to emphasize the
      reason more strongly than それで. そのため(に) often implies a more direct and significant consequence.

  If you want to simply connect two related events, それで is a natural choice. If you want to highlight
  the direct reason or purpose behind something, そのため(に) might be more appropriate.
