  Being an unofficial helper verb, かけ is what is known as a 造語 (neologism) and carries a specific meaning when used in conjunction with other words. This is similar to 向け. かけ comes from the verb 掛ける "to suspend" and may be attached to the conjunctive form (masu-stem) of verbs to convey that the action is "unfinished". Usually, this translates as "half (A)", "about to (A)", or "not yet finished (A)". かけ behaves like a noun, so it may be followed by the case-marking particle の when attached directly to another noun, or by だ when at the end of a sentence. Occasionally, the verb 掛ける itself may be used instead of the noun form, かけ.

  **Fun Fact:**
  As the literal meaning of 掛ける is "to suspend", it expresses that something is stuck somewhere in the process of happening. This is similar to taking a photo of someone who is jumping. In the photo, it will look like they are "suspended", but that is only because one particular moment has been captured, somewhere between the start and the finish. かけ conveys exactly the same meaning and therefore may be interpreted differently depending on the verb it is paired with.

  With verbs that express a momentary action (something that cannot be "half" done), かけ will convey that the action was "on the verge of" happening.

  However, with verbs that are ongoing actions, かけ will simply imply that they are "in the process" of being done.

post_example_writeup: かけ is a versatile construction that provides nuance about the state of an action.
  Pay attention to the context to determine whether it means "half-", "about to", or "in the process of".
  It's often used in casual conversation.
false_friends:
  - term: たて
    meaning: Freshly ~ed, Just ~ed
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「かけ」, 「たて」 indicates an action has just been completed. For example, 「炊きたてのご飯」 means
      freshly cooked rice, the opposite of something like 「食べかけのご飯」 (half-eaten rice).
  - term: るところだ
    meaning: About to, On the verge of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「るところだ」 also means "about to", it focuses more on the immediate future and the point
      right before an action happens. 「かけ」 has a broader sense of something being in progress or not yet
      complete.
  - term: はじめる
    meaning: To start, To begin to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「はじめる」 means to start an action, while 「かけ」 implies the action has started but is not yet
      finished or is close to starting. They both relate to the beginning of an action, but 「かけ」 emphasizes
      the incomplete nature.
  - term: だす
    meaning: To suddenly begin, To start doing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「だす」 indicates a sudden start of an action. 「かけ」 doesn't necessarily imply suddenness but
      rather focuses on the unfinished state or the near beginning of an action.
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「かけ」 and similar expressions, consider the specific
  nuance you want to convey. 「たて」 emphasizes completion, 「るところだ」 focuses on the immediate future, and
  「はじめる/だす」 highlight the starting point. 「かけ」 uniquely expresses the state of being in the middle of
  an action or very near its beginning.
