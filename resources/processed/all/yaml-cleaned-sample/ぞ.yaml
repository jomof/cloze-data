writeup: はい、こんにちは！ Today we're going to learn about the particle ぞ. Think of ぞ as adding a punch to your
  sentences! It's like saying something with a lot of conviction or excitement. It's similar to よ, but
  much stronger and more often used by men. While よ can be a simple statement of fact, ぞ really emphasizes
  your point. You can often translate it with an exclamation point for emphasis. You can put ぞ at the
  end of any sentence, but remember it needs to follow something that can be conjugated, like a verb or
  an adjective. Sometimes, the speaker uses ぞ to motivate themselves or to express strong determination,
  not necessarily directed at someone else. **Important Consideration:** While less common, ぞ can also
  act like the particle は, drawing extra attention to the topic. It can even follow question words for
  emphasis.
