writeup: |-
  **次第 (shidai)** is a noun that functions as a suffix, often translated as "as soon as". It follows the dictionary form of verbs or the stem of する verbs. The core meaning of 次第 is about **determining sequence**. The action described before 次第 dictates when the following action will occur.

  Key points to remember:

  *  **Verb (dictionary form) + 次第**: This indicates that the second action will happen immediately after the first action is completed. The completion of the first verb triggers the second.
  *  **Noun (stem of する verb) + 次第**: Similar to the verb construction, the completion of the nominalized action triggers the subsequent action.
  *  The register is generally **formal**, often used in polite speech (敬語).

  The nuance implies that the second action is a direct consequence of the completion of the first.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 次第 primarily focuses on the temporal sequence
  when used with verbs. While some of the listed expressions share the "as soon as" meaning, they often
  carry slightly different nuances regarding the immediacy or spontaneity of the action. When 次第 means
  "depending on", focus on the idea that something will be determined by a preceding factor. Expressions
  like 「にかかわる」 and 「によって」 also indicate dependence but can have broader applications.
