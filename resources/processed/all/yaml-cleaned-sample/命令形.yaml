writeup: |-
  In Japanese, there are numerous ways to express an order, command, or instruction. The most direct, abrasive, and therefore least used method is the **imperative form** (命令形), which is one of the basic conjugations of verbs. Without particles following it, the imperative form is fairly uncommon in daily life, but will often be seen on traffic signs, posters, or banners. In addition, it can be heard shouted at demonstrations, when cheering at sports events, or in urgent situations, such as an officer yelling at a suspect to stop.

  Verbs are conjugated into the imperative form in the following way:

  *  For **う-verbs**, simply replace the last kana of any verb with the equivalent え sound kana from the same row. For example, 飲む (nomu - to drink) becomes 飲め (nome - drink!).
  *  For **る-verbs**, replace る with either ろ or よ. For example, 食べる (taberu - to eat) becomes 食べろ (tabero - eat!). The use of よ is becoming less common and is considered a more formal or written variant.
  *  For the irregular verb **する (suru - to do)**, the imperative is しろ (shiro - do!).
  *  For the irregular verb **くる (kuru - to come)**, the imperative is こい (koi - come!).

  The imperative form may sometimes be softened with the particle よ. This is a pattern mostly used by men who are familiar with each other to offer advice or encouragement. Women tend to use the more polite て-form of verbs instead.

  Any verb except for ある and いる may be conjugated to the imperative form, due to their meanings being based on existence and nothing more.

  **Important Considerations**:

  *  The polite imperative なさい, which comes from なさる, is mostly used by teachers and parents talking to their children. It is also often used in instructions on test papers.
  *  When speaking to animals, the polite prefix お plus the ます-stem will also occasionally be used, for example, お座り (osuwari - sit!).
