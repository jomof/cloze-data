  **ようでは** combines the auxiliary verb **よう** (meaning "manner" or "seeming") with **では**, which functions as a conjunction often abbreviating **それなら** ("if that's the case"). Consequently, **ようでは** conveys the meaning of "if," with an added nuance that the preceding statement (A) is something uncertain or based on the speaker's observation or assumption. It can be translated as "if it is the case that (A)" or "if what seems to be (A) is true."

  Most commonly, **ようでは** is used to express a negative evaluation: if (A) is true, a particular undesirable outcome will follow. It typically follows verbs in their plain forms. **ようでは** emphasizes the appearance or condition of (A) based on the speaker's perception. It often reflects the speaker's subjective, negative opinion about what they believe to be the situation.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **ようじゃ** is a more casual alternative to **ようでは**.
  *  The nuance of **ようでは** suggests the speaker is making a judgment based on how things appear.
  *  The outcome described after **ようでは** is usually negative.

  - term: ては
    meaning: If, With, Since, Because
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ようでは」, 「ては」 doesn't inherently carry the nuance of the speaker's subjective observation
      or judgment. It's a more direct way of expressing a conditional relationship.
  - term: ようだ
    meaning: It seems that, It appears that, It looks like
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「ようだ」 expresses seeming or appearance, 「ようでは」 builds upon this by adding the conditional
      「では」, creating the "if it seems that..." meaning with an implication of a negative consequence.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ては」 and 「ようだ」 share some semantic overlap with 「ようでは」, it's important
  to recognize the specific nuance that 「ようでは」 brings. 「ては」 is a more general conditional marker. 「ようだ」
  simply states an observation or assumption. 「ようでは」 combines these elements to express a conditional
  based on an observed or assumed state, often with a negative evaluation of that state and its likely
  consequences.
