writeup: |-
  Used in almost exactly the same way as "the former" and "the latter" in English, **前者** and **後者** are two nouns that appear frequently in Japanese. The adverbial particle **は** will appear after these words to express contrast between the two. **前者** will be used for "the former", while **後者** will represent "the latter". Both **前者** and **後者** appear at the beginning of their own statements, with a specific comment about each being made after **は**.

  **Important Consideration:** Statements made that use **前者** and **後者** require some sort of relationship in what is being compared. Usually, this will be obvious within the context of the sentence, but is something that you will need to be careful of when making your own sentences.

  **Etymology:**
  *  **前 (ぜん)** means "front" or "previous".
  *  **者 (しゃ)** means "person" or "thing" (in this context, referring to one of the items being discussed).
  *  **後 (こう)** means "back" or "later".
examples:
  - japanese: どの大学に行くか迷っています。前者は家に近いが学費が高い、後者は家から遠いが学費が半分ぐらい安い。
    english: I'm trying to decide which university to go to. The former is close to home, but the tuition
      is high. The latter is far from home, but the tuition is about half the price.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: This sentence uses 「が」 to contrast the characteristics of the former and latter options, a
      common way to use 前者 and 後者.
  - japanese: 地下鉄と新幹線、前者は地下をゆっくりと走り、後者は速いスピードで地上を走る。
    english: 'Subways and bullet trains: the former runs slowly underground, and the latter runs above
      ground at high speed.'

    setting: informative
    nuance: The sentence structure is straightforward, clearly stating a feature of each. The use of 「と」
      to list the two items being compared is natural.
  - japanese: こっちのケーキとそっちのケーキ、どっちが好き?前者は甘くて、後者はちょっと大人の味。

      a slightly more adult flavor.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「どっちが好き?」 is a casual way to ask 'which do you prefer?'. 「ちょっと大人の味」 implies a flavor that
      might not appeal to children, adding a bit of sophistication.

    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male

      'report submission method'.
post_example_writeup: Remember that when using **前者は・後者は**, the two items being compared should have a
  logical connection or be part of the same category. Avoid comparing completely unrelated things, as
  illustrated in the unnatural example in the input data.

  and **まえに** (before). **前者は** and **後者は** are used to refer to specific items in a comparison, while
  **あとで** and **まえに** indicate temporal order.
