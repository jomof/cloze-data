  ごとに is a combination of the noun ごと and the particle に. Together, they function adverbially, indicating that something happens "every (A)" or "at intervals of (A)." It typically follows a noun or a phrase ending with a noun. While it can follow verbs, its most common usage is with nouns or noun phrases.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  ごとは the *kun'yomi* (Japanese reading) of the kanji 毎, which means "every." This is crucial for understanding the difference between ごとに and おきに, another grammar point meaning "every" but emphasizing the **interval** or **gap** between occurrences.
  *  **Difference between ごとに and おきに:**
  *  (A)ごとに = During every (A), (B). (Emphasizes each instance)
  *  (A)おきに = After every space of (A), (B). (Emphasizes the interval)
  For example:
  *  一週間ごとに (isshūkan ごとに): Every week (each week without exception).
  *  一週間おきに (isshūkan oki ni): Every other week (with a one-week interval).

  *  **Common Mistake:** It's worth noting that many native speakers, particularly younger generations, sometimes use ごとに and おきに interchangeably, despite their slightly different nuances.

  "each" or "every." Consider whether you want to emphasize the individual instances (ごとに), the interval
  between them (おきに), the near-constant repetition (まい～のように), the triggering of a response (たびに, につけ),
  or the frequency within a period (に).
