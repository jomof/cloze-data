  Similar to つまり, 即ち is used to rephrase or explain something previously stated, offering an equivalent expression. It can be translated as "in other words," "namely," or "that is to say." While 即ち functions as an adverb, it often acts as a conjunction, linking two clauses by providing clarification or a different perspective on the first clause.

  **Important Consideration:** The kanji for 即ち (即) carries a nuance of "conformance" or "agreement." This suggests that 即ち introduces an explanation that closely aligns with or corresponds to the initial statement. In contrast, つまり focuses more on summarizing or condensing information.

false_friends:
  - term: つまり
    meaning: In short, To sum up, In other words
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both can mean "in other words," つまり emphasizes summarizing or concluding, while 即ち focuses
      on providing an equivalent or clarifying expression.
  - term: ということは
    meaning: That means, That is to say
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ということは often implies a deduction or consequence based on the preceding statement, whereas
      即ち offers a direct rephrasing.
  - term: 要するに
    meaning: To sum up, In summary, In short
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 要するに is used to provide a concise summary or the main point, similar to つまり, but with a stronger
      emphasis on getting to the essence of the matter. 即ち is less about summarizing and more about restating
      for clarity.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 即ち introduces a restatement or clarification
  that closely corresponds to the previous statement. つまり and 要するに are better suited for summarizing or
  reaching a conclusion. ということは indicates a logical consequence or implication.
