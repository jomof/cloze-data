  `で言うと` is an expression in Japanese that is commonly used to ask questions, or to give information about how one thing corresponds with another. It is a combination of the case marking particle で meaning "with", and 言うと meaning "if said", or "if we say". This structure appears after nouns and can be translated as "if said with (A), (B)". `で言うと` is often seen in sentences with `に当たる` ("to be equivalent to"), another common grammar structure used for drawing connections between things. **Important Note:** `で言うと` functions as a set phrase and does not conjugate.

  **Fun Fact:** 一言で言うと is a set expression that means "to put it in a word", "in short", or "to sum up".
