  Similar to ～ようと思う meaning "I think I will do (A)," ～ようとしない combines the volitional form of a verb (よう) with the particle と and the verb する. ～ようとしない typically translates to "will not do (A)," with an added emphasis on a **lack of effort or willingness**. It suggests that someone is consciously choosing not to do something.

  **Important Consideration:** Because ～ようとしない implies a deliberate lack of effort, it often carries a **negative connotation**. It is generally used to describe other people's actions rather than the speaker's own. Using ～ようとしない to refer to yourself can sound abrupt or even rude, as if you are making a strong declaration of refusal. When speaking about your own intentions, ようと思わない, meaning "I don't think I will do (A)," is a more appropriate and softer alternative.
