writeup: まで is a particle that roughly means "as far as". When used with nouns indicating a time or endpoint,
  it often translates to "until" or "till". For locations, まで indicates movement "to" a specific place,
  implying that the journey doesn't extend beyond that point. It can also be used with past time references,
  similar to using "up until" in English.

    meaning: Until (something) happens
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to Noun + まで for time, using a verb emphasizes the action that continues until
      another action occurs, rather than just a point in time.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that when まで follows a noun indicating time or
  place, it signifies 'until' or 'to'. までに always indicates a deadline. When you see まで after a verb or
  used in a surprising context, it likely means 'even'.
