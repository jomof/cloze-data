writeup: |-
  Coming from the same kanji as 難しい "difficult", 難い is a suffix that also means "difficult". However, in the case of がたい, it will be attached to the **conjunctive form (masu-stem)** of verbs and conveys that "(A) is difficult to do". がたい is almost always written without kanji in this meaning.

  Compared to にくい, which can simply imply that something is "uncomfortable" to do, がたい refers almost exclusively to 困難であること "things that involve a high degree of difficulty, distress, or infeasibility". Due to this, がたい will come across as far stronger than にくい and may imply that a certain task is almost impossible.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Strength of Difficulty:** がたい implies a higher degree of difficulty than にくい.
  *  **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity:** にくい often reflects the speaker's personal feeling or ability, while がたい emphasizes the inherent difficulty of the task.
  *  **Usage:** がたい is used for things that are inherently hard to do or believe, often due to the nature of the action itself.

false_friends:
  - term: ようがない・ようもない
    meaning: There's no way to, It's impossible to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both express impossibility, ようがない/ようもない often emphasizes the lack of means or methods,
      whereas がたい focuses on the inherent difficulty of the action itself.
  - term: にくい
    meaning: Difficult to, Hard to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike がたい, にくい often reflects a subjective feeling or personal experience of difficulty.
      がたい implies a more objective, inherent challenge.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up がたい with similar expressions, focus on the nuance of inherent
  difficulty. If the difficulty stems from the nature of the action itself, がたい is more appropriate. If
  it's about a lack of means or a personal feeling of difficulty, consider ようがない/ようもない or にくい, respectively.
