writeup: The grammar points **としたら**, **とすれば**, and **とすると** are used to express hypothetical situations
  or assumptions. They all essentially mean "if we assume that" or "if it were the case that." The particle
  **と** marks the preceding clause as a content of thought or assumption. The variations **したら**, **すれば**,
  and **すると** are conjugations of the verb **する** (to do), indicating different conditional forms. While
  subtle nuances exist, in everyday conversation, they are often used interchangeably to introduce a hypothetical
  scenario and its potential consequence. You can attach these forms to the end of a verb, い-adjective,
  or a noun/な-adjective followed by **だ**.
