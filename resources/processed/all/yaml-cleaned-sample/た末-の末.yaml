  Appearing with verbs in their past form, or grouped with nouns after の is 末, a word meaning "end tip". に will follow 末, marking the "tip" as the point from which something will result.

  While this grammar pattern is usually translated as "after (A), (B)", or "as a result of (A), (B)", the nuance is on various things having happened along the way, and then finally reaching the **conclusion** of (A). 末に may highlight either positive or negative results, but will suggest that some long-lasting effort or struggle eventually resulted in (B).
