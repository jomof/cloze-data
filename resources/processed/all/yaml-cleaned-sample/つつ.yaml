writeup: つつ is a particle in Japanese that appears after the ます-stem form of verbs. It indicates that
  action (B) is happening at the same time as action (A). This usually translates as "while (A), (B)".
  つつ is a formal grammar structure, more common in writing than in speech. **Important Consideration:**
  Unlike ながら, つつ is more often used when action (A) is an ongoing state rather than a physical action
  involving movement. ながら can be used for both physical motions and states. However, action (B) in つつ
  sentences can be either physical movements or ongoing states.

    english: While knowing it's bad for the environment, I continue to use plastic bags.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: ます-stem
    nuance: The phrase 「知りつつ」 combines the verb 「知る」 (to know) in its ます-stem form 「知り」 with 「つつ」 to express
      the ongoing state of knowing.

false_friends:
  - term: ながら
    meaning: While ~ing, During, As
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike つつ, ながら can be used more broadly for both ongoing states and physical actions happening
      simultaneously. ながら is also less formal than つつ.
  - term: ついでに
    meaning: While you are at it, On the occasion
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike つつ, ついでに indicates doing something as an additional action when you are already doing
      something else. It implies convenience or taking advantage of an opportunity, not necessarily simultaneous
      occurrence.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that つつ emphasizes the simultaneous occurrence
  of two actions, especially when the first action is an ongoing state. ながら is more flexible, and ついでに
  focuses on the idea of doing something additionally or conveniently.
