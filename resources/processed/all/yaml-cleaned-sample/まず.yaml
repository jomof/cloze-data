  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
writeup: Like many other adverbs in Japanese, **まず** can be used to modify a whole phrase or sentence.
  This means it will regularly appear at the beginning of a statement. **まず** is associated with the kanji
  先 and therefore carries the meaning of "first" or "starting with." **まず** is regularly used when you
  want to convey that something **should** be done before anything else or discussed first, and not when
  something is first in rank. In sentences discussing rank, it would be far more natural to use expressions
  like 一番 (いちばん), 最初 (さいしょ), or 一位 (いちい).
