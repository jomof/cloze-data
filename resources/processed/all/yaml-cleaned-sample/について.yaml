grammar_point: について
jlpt: N3
meaning: Concerning, About, Regarding
details:
  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
writeup: について combines the case-marking particle に, the verb 就(つ)く "to assume a position", and the conjunction
  particle て. It generally translates to "about (A)" or "concerning (A)". A more literal interpretation
  might be "taking the position of (A)" or "assuming the topic of (A)". You'll find について used after nouns
  or noun phrases (like those using こと or の). It can also precede の + noun, meaning "(A) that is about
  (B)". Although it comes from the verb 就く, the kanji is rarely used, and について is usually treated as a
  single compound word.
