writeup: |-
  **こととて** is a formal expression indicating a reason or cause, similar to saying "due to," "since," or "because of." It combines the noun **こと** (thing, matter) with the adverbial particle **とて**, which presents a reason. This grammar point is considered somewhat old-fashioned and is primarily found in written Japanese.

  To use **こととて**, attach it to the end of a verb or a noun followed by the particle **の**. It's often used when seeking understanding or forgiveness for a situation. Therefore, when used with verbs, they are often in the past tense or negated with **ない** or **ぬ**, emphasizing something done (or not done) that led to a particular outcome.

  Frequently, the reason given with **こととて** is one where the negative consequence is obvious or expected.

  **Etymology:**

  The particle **とて** is thought to be either a combination of the case-marking particle **と** and the conjunctive particle **て**, or the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb **たり** combined with **と** and **て**. Due to its unclear origin, it's best to learn **こととて** as a distinct structure with its own specific meaning.
