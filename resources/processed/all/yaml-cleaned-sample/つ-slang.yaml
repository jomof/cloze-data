  **つ** is a slang grammar pattern that originates from **という**, meaning "called (A)," "that (A) that was said," or "known as (A)." Essentially, it quotes something that was previously said. You might also see it as **っつ** or **つう**.

  Remember that **という** is a combination of the quotation particle **と** and the verb **言う** (いう), meaning "to say." Since **と** is the quotation particle, **つ** can follow almost any statement or word type.

  Although **つ** is strong slang, it's very common. You'll often hear native speakers abbreviate **という** in various ways, with **つ** being the shortest.

  The slight pause in **っつ** might suggest the speaker is annoyed or impatient, but this isn't always the case.

  **Important Consideration:**

  Even though **言う** disappears when using **つ**, the standard conjugation rules still apply. To indicate past tense ("was said") or progressive form ("is being said"), use forms like **つった** or **つってん**. The change of **ている** to **てん** is further explained in the slang lesson for **ん**.

post_example_writeup: Remember that while "tsu" is a very common slang term, it's important to be mindful
  of your audience and the formality of the situation. While it's perfectly acceptable among friends and
  in casual settings, it would be inappropriate in formal or professional contexts.
