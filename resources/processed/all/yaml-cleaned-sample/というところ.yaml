  というところ is a grammar expression that is used when highlighting an approximate number or degree for something. It is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the う-Verb 言う "to say", and the noun ところ "place", which often marks situations. Common translations include "I would say about (A)", "I guess about (A)". A more literal translation is "To be at the point where saying (A) is accurate".

  It is most common for this structure to appear following either verbs or nouns, but may also occasionally follow adjectives. Coming primarily at the end of sentences, というところ will often be followed immediately by the auxiliary verb だ or です.

  Occasionally, という will be replaced by the past-tense form, といった. However, the meaning does not change at all in these cases.

  **Important Consideration:**
  というところ has a tendency to be used when the number being given is the theoretical maximum for something, rather than the theoretical minimum. Due to this, it may sound unnatural when wanting to present an approximate minimum.
