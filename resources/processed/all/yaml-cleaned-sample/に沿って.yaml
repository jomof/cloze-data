  The grammar point **に沿って (にそって)** expresses the idea of following a guideline, path, or principle. It literally means "along (something)" and is used to indicate that an action or decision is being made in accordance with something else. This "something else" is often a rule, law, plan, wish, or physical path. The nuance is that the first noun acts as a guide or standard that the second part of the sentence adheres to.

  You can think of it like staying within the boundaries or parameters set by the first noun. For example, following a dotted line to cut something, or adhering to company rules when performing a task.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The particle **に** is crucial here, indicating the direction or the standard being followed.
  *  The verb **沿う (そう)** means "to run alongside," "to follow," or "to go along with."
