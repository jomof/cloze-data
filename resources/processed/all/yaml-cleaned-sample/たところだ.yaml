writeup: |-
  Similar to how **ところ** (sometimes shortened to **とこ**) means "about to (A)" or "on the verge of (A)" when following the dictionary form of a verb, when following the auxiliary verb **た**, **ところ** means "just did (A)". To use this structure, conjugate a verb to its past tense, and then add **ところだ**. This expresses "just did (A)". **ていたところだ** can be used when you want to express that you "were just doing (A)".

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  When the kanji form of **所** is used, it often refers to an actual physical location rather than a situation or standpoint. However, native speakers sometimes make this mistake. Therefore, both the kanji form and the hiragana form are relatively common.

  is future-oriented, 「たばかり」 emphasizes recency, and 「たとたんに」 highlights the near-simultaneous occurrence
  of events. 「たて」 often applies to freshly made things.
