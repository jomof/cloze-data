  使用域: 一般
writeup: 「ことだし」 is a combination of the noun 「こと」 "thing", the auxiliary verb 「だ」, and the conjunction
  particle 「し」, used for listing reasons. The whole structure often translates simply as "because (A)",
  or "since (A)", but places extra emphasis on there being other reasons besides what the speaker has
  specified. This structure may appear after any word in its attributive form, or after a noun that has
  been followed by 「の」. Just like with its standard use in creating lists, 「し」 is being used in this grammar
  point to show that (A) is not the only reason. The nuance is that "while there are other reasons, (A)
  is good enough to (B)". (B) is usually some suggestion, invitation, or expression of determination.
