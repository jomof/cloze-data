  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
writeup: The particle 「と」 functions as a conditional conjunction, similar to "if" in English, but with
  a nuance of inevitability or a natural consequence. It indicates that whenever condition A occurs, result
  B will *always* follow. This makes it stronger and more direct than 「ば」、「なら」、or 「たら」, which express
  hypothetical outcomes. Think of 「と」 as emphasizing the inherent connection between the two events, almost
  like saying "when A happens, *naturally* B happens". It highlights a predictable or established relationship.
  Because of this inherent connection, the (B) part of the sentence using 「と」 will always occur when (A)
  happens. It cannot be used when the (B) result is just a possibility; it must be definite or highly
  likely. Essentially, while translated as "if", the core meaning of 「と」 in this context is closer to
  "and", implying a consistent pairing of events.

post_false_friends_writeup: While all these grammar points can express conditional relationships, it's
  important to remember the specific nuance of 「と」. Use 「と」 when the result is a natural, predictable,
  or inevitable consequence of the condition. If you're talking about a hypothetical situation or a possibility,
  「ば」、「たら」、or 「なら」 are more appropriate. 「すると」 and 「そうすると」 are useful for describing sequences of events,
  but 「と」 emphasizes the inherent connection between the condition and the result.
