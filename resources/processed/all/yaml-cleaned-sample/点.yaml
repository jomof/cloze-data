  **点 (てん)** literally means 'point' or 'dot'. Grammatically, it's used to specify a particular **aspect**, **respect**, or **point of view**. Think of it as highlighting a specific area of focus. You can translate it as "in terms of," "from the viewpoint of," "with respect to," or "in that."

  To use 点, attach it to:

  *  The **attributive form** of an adjective or verb (plain form + noun).
  *  A **noun + の**.
  *  A **phrase + という**.

  点 is almost always followed by the particle **で**. Sometimes, **で** is replaced by other expressions like **について** (regarding) or **からいうと** (speaking from). These alternatives emphasize the specific viewpoint being presented.
