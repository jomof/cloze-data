  さ is a suffix in Japanese that can be attached to the stem form of い-Adjectives and な-Adjectives. When this happens, it transforms the target adjective into a noun that illustrates the "amount" or "degree" of that particular adjective. This commonly translates as '-ness' in English (sweetness, tallness, spiciness, etc.).

  **Fun Fact:** It is thought that this suffix originally stemmed from the kanji 差 (meaning 'distinction'), and was used for highlighting things that were distinctive features of something. In this way, さ is also sometimes used after the dictionary form of verbs, to highlight a distinct point in time that something happens. However, this use of the suffix is far less common in modern Japanese, and is known as 'poetic language'. It was primarily used during Japan's 'middle ages', which spanned from (around) 1100 until close to the end of the 1500s.

post_example_writeup: As shown in the examples, さ can attach to both い-adjectives (like 「長い」 becoming
  「長さ」) and な-adjectives (like 「大切」 becoming 「大切さ」). The meaning shifts from describing a quality to representing
  the degree or extent of that quality as a noun. The usage with verbs is rare in modern conversation
  but understanding it provides insight into the suffix's historical roots.
false_friends:
  - term: み
    meaning: ~ness, Used to indicate conditions or nature
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike さ which focuses on the degree or amount, み tends to describe a general condition or
      nature. For example, 「深さ (fukasa - depth)」 refers to the measurement of depth, while 「深み (fukami
      - depth/profoundness)」 suggests a deeper, more nuanced quality.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both さ and み can translate to '-ness', remember that さ focuses on the
  measurable degree or amount of a quality, whereas み often describes a more inherent nature or condition.
  Paying attention to the specific nuance you want to convey will help you choose the right suffix.
