  っぱなし is a suffix that originally comes from the う-verb 放す (hanasu) meaning "to let loose". When attached to the conjunctive form (連用形 - ren'yōkei, or verb stem) of verbs, it indicates that something has been "left" in a certain state. **Important Note:** っぱなし is almost exclusively used with a negative connotation, implying that the state should have been changed or stopped. Think of it as something being "left undone" or "continuing unchecked".

  **Fun Fact:** Although 放す means "to let loose", っぱなし conveys a feeling closer to "being unchecked". This means っぱなし can express two main ideas:

  *  The action described by the verb continues without stopping or anyone to stop it.
  *  The state resulting from the action continues without being changed or addressed.

  the context.

  - term: ままに (as desired)
    meaning: As is, While remaining, Left in a state
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike っぱなし, ままに doesn't necessarily carry a negative connotation. It simply describes a state
      being maintained. For example, 「自然のままに」 (shizen no mama ni) means "in a natural state" and is not
      negative.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both っぱなし and ままに can describe something being left in a certain state,
  the key difference lies in the implication. Use っぱなし when you want to convey a sense of something being
  left undone or continuing unchecked, often with negative consequences or inconvenience. Use ままに when
  you want to describe a state being maintained without necessarily implying a negative judgment.
