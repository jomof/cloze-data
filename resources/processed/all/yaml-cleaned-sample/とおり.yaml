writeup: |-
  The noun **とおり** often means "in that way" or "just like that." Written as 通り in kanji, it literally translates to "street" or "way." However, when used as a suffix, it frequently indicates the degree of similarity between two things.

  **とおり** (or **どおり**) can follow verbs or nouns. When used with verbs, it commonly follows both the plain form and the simple past tense. Both **どおり** and **のとおり** can be used directly after nouns. However, **とおり** is only used with the case-marking particle **の** between the noun and **とおり**. While both structures are often interchangeable, **どおり** is more frequent, especially in spoken Japanese.

  **Important Note:** Constructions like **言った通り** and **その通り** are very common and serve as polite ways to agree with someone. In these instances, they translate to phrases like "that's exactly right" or "that's it!"
