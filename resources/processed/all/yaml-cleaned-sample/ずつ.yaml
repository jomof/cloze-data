writeup: ずつ, or 宛 in its kanji form, is a **suffix** in Japanese that is used to highlight things that
  occur or exist in specific amounts. It is often translated simply as "each", "per", or "at a time".
  Some sources consider ずつ to be an adverbial particle, but this doesn't change its usage. ずつ is used
  **directly after the number or amount** of something, indicating that amount is the grouping done "at
  a time".
