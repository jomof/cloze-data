writeup: |-
  **である** (or **であります**) is a construction in Japanese that is considered to be the formal equivalent of **だ**. This should not be confused with the polite speech word **です**, as **である** is simply a combination of the conjunctive form of **だ**, and the う-Verb, **ある**. **である** may be used in any place that **だ** would usually be used, but is most likely to be found at the end of sentences or statements.

  **Fun Fact:** Because the **な** that is used with な-Adjectives is simply the attributive form of **だ**, **である** may replace **な** or **の** when connecting one noun to another. The attributive form just means the form of a word that can be directly linked to a noun. As **ある**'s attributive form is just **ある**, it does not need to be modified at all. However, although this is grammatically correct, it would sound quite stiff in many circumstances and should be avoided in standard speech.

  **Caution:** **であります** (as opposed to **である**) is very formal and will almost exclusively be used by people within jobs that absolutely require this level of formality (politics, police force, military, etc.). Due to this, its use within regular conversation will sound stiff, or perhaps even like the speaker is jokingly being over polite.

    kind: synonym
    nuance: While **である** is the formal equivalent of **だ**, **だ** is used in casual speech and with close
      friends and family. "これは私の本だ" (This is my book) uses the more casual **だ**.
  - term: です
    meaning: To be, Is
    kind: synonym
    nuance: '**です** is the polite form of **だ** and is used in most everyday situations when speaking
      to someone you aren''t very close with or someone of higher status. "これは私の本です" (This is my book)
      is polite and appropriate for most situations.'

    kind: synonym
    nuance: While sometimes interchangeable in very formal contexts, **たる** specifically indicates someone's
      role or position. For example, "親たる者" (as a parent) highlights the role of being a parent, whereas
      **である** simply states a fact.
post_false_friends_writeup: While **である**, **だ**, and **です** all function as copulas (linking verbs),
  their usage depends heavily on the context and your relationship with the listener. **である** is reserved
  for formal and literary settings. **だ** is casual, and **です** is polite. **がある** describes existence,
  not definition. **たる** indicates a position or role. Be mindful of the nuance each carries to choose
  the appropriate form.
