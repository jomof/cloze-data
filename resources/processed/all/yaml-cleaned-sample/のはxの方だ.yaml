  「のは〜の方だ」 is an expression used to indicate that (A) is (B), often implying a contrast or highlighting a specific individual or thing, sometimes against expectations. It can be translated as "the one that (A), is (B)" or "it is (B) who (A)".

  This phrase is constructed with:

  *  **のは:** This nominalizes the preceding clause, turning it into a noun phrase. If the clause ends with a noun, 「なのは」 is used instead.
  *  **は:** This particle marks the topic and often implies a contrast.
  *  **の方:** This noun means "side" or "direction." Using 「方」 softens the statement, making it less direct than simply saying 「のはXだ」.
  *  **だ (or です):** This is the copula, meaning "is."

  The literal sense is something like, "regarding that which is (A), it's on the side of (B)." This indirect phrasing can make the statement sound more gentle, especially when assigning responsibility or blame.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  This grammar point is frequently used in situations where someone feels they are primarily responsible for something, often in an apologetic context.
