writeup: |-
  The pattern あまり + Verb/い-adjective (ない form) or な-adjective (ではない form) expresses the idea of something not being very much, or hardly being the case. It conveys a sense of **lesser extent** or **lower frequency**. The casual form of あまり is あんまり. Place あまり directly before the negative form of the verb or adjective.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While often translated as "not very," the literal sense of あまり comes from the kanji 余り, meaning "excess" or "to be in excess." Thus, あまり implies "not excessively," which subtly shifts the nuance to suggest a lack of something reaching a certain degree rather than a complete absence.
  *  The nuance of あまり can change slightly depending on whether the sentence is positive or negative, but when used with the negative form (～ない), it consistently indicates a low degree or frequency.
