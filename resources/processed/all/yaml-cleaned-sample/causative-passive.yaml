writeup: |-
  The causative-passive form in Japanese combines the causative auxiliary verb せる (for う-verbs) or させる (for る-verbs and する verbs) with the passive auxiliary verb られる. This form expresses that the subject was made or forced to do something, often against their will. The nuance is generally negative, reflecting the speaker's feeling of being compelled to act.

  To form the causative-passive, first conjugate the verb into its causative form. For う-verbs, change the final vowel to the corresponding あ-vowel and add せる. For る-verbs, simply add させる. する becomes させる, and 来る (くる) becomes 来させる (こさせる).

  Next, take the causative form and treat it like a る-verb. Remove the final る and add られる. For example:

  *  飲む (nomu, to drink) → 飲ませる (nomaseru, to make/let drink) → 飲ませられる (nomase rareru, to be made to drink)
  *  食べる (taberu, to eat) → 食べさせる (tabe saseru, to make/let eat) → 食べさせられる (tabe sase rareru, to be made to eat)
  *  する (suru, to do) → させる (saseru, to make/let do) → させられる (sase rareru, to be made to do)
  *  来る (kuru, to come) → 来させる (kosaseru, to make/let come) → 来させられる (kosa serareru, to be made to come)

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The person *doing* the forcing is marked with the particle に.
  *  The person being forced (the subject of the sentence) is marked with は or が.
  *  The causative-passive form inherently carries a passive meaning, so using just れる or られる is not sufficient to express this specific nuance of being *made* to do something.
examples:
  - japanese: おばあちゃんの家に行くとお腹がいっぱいでもいっぱい食べさせられる。

false_friends:
  - term: Verb［れる・られる］
    meaning: To be done to ~ by ~, Done without consent, Done to one's dismay
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「Causative-Passive」, 「Verb［れる・られる］」 simply indicates a passive voice where an action
      is done to the subject. It doesn't necessarily imply force or obligation. For example, 「雨に降られた」(ame
      ni furareta - I was rained on) uses the passive form without the causative nuance.
  - term: Verb［せる・させる］
    meaning: To make/let/have (somebody do something)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「Causative-Passive」, 「Verb［せる・させる］」 expresses the causative voice where the subject
      *causes* someone else to do something. It doesn't convey the feeling of being the recipient of the
      forced action. For example, 「子供に宿題をさせる」(kodomo ni shukudai o saseru - I make my child do homework)
      focuses on the action of causing, not being forced.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that the causative-passive form emphasizes the
  recipient being compelled to act. The simple passive (れる/られる) focuses on receiving an action, and the
  causative (せる/させる) focuses on causing an action. The combination of both forms creates the specific
  nuance of being made to do something.
