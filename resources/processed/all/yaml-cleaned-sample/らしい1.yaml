writeup: The auxiliary verb **らしい** expresses that the speaker has heard or has some information leading
  them to believe something is true, but they are not stating it as a definite fact. It conveys a sense
  of "it seems like" or "apparently". It's often used when relaying information or making a somewhat confident
  assumption based on evidence. **らしい** attaches directly to the plain form of verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives
  (without な), and nouns. It's important to distinguish this usage from the other **らしい** which means
  "typical of".
