writeup: |-
  びる, similar to めく, is a verb suffix. It functions as a る-Verb and translates to "(A) looking," "(A) seeming," or "behaving like (A)." びる is quite **formal** and follows a limited set of expressions. It attaches to nouns or, occasionally, the stem form of い-Adjectives. びる indicates that the speaker perceives something as **giving off the sense of (A)**, based on visual information. As a descriptive verb, びる changes to **びた** when directly modifying a noun.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Both びる and めく share a similarity with さ, the suffix that creates nouns indicating an extent from adjectives. When びる or めく attach to a word, they transform that word into a verb expressing "having the feeling of (A)" or, in the past tense, "having gained the feeling of (A)."
