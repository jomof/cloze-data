  や is a particle that has several different roles in Japanese, with the most common being as a **listing particle**. It's used similarly to と as "and", but instead of creating an exhaustive list, や indicates a **non-exhaustive** list, meaning "things like (A), (B), and so on." Think of it as saying there are other items in the category you're mentioning, even if you don't list them all.

  や is always used to connect **nouns**. It simply comes directly after each noun in the list.

  To understand the difference between と and や, imagine you're talking about what you bought at the store. If you say 「りんごとみかんを買った」 (I bought apples and oranges), it implies you only bought those two items. This is because と creates a complete list. However, if you say 「りんごやみかんを買った」 (I bought things like apples and oranges), it suggests you might have bought other things as well, like bananas or grapes.

  **Important Consideration:** Remember, や can only be used with nouns. To list actions or states, you would use grammar points like たり～たりする or とか.
examples:
  - japanese: コンビニでお水やおかしを買った。
    english: I bought things like water and snacks at the convenience store.
    register: casual
    setting: casual
    nuance: 「お水」and「おかし」are connected with 「や」, indicating that these are examples of what was bought,
      and there might have been other items.
    etymology: 「お水」 is a polite way to say 'water'.
  - japanese: 日本語にはひらがなやカタカナや漢字があります。
    english: In Japanese, there are things like Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji.
    register: informative
    setting: informative
    nuance: Listing 「ひらがな」、「カタカナ」、and 「漢字」 as examples of Japanese scripts, with the implication that
      there might be other writing systems or aspects of the language.
  - japanese: 今度、京都や東京や大阪みたいな場所に旅行に行きたいな。
    english: Next time, I want to travel to places like Kyoto, Tokyo, or Osaka.
    register: casual
    setting: dreamy
    nuance: 「京都」、「東京」、and 「大阪」are listed as desirable travel destinations, but the speaker uses 「みたいな」
      to further emphasize the 'like' aspect, suggesting they are open to similar cities.

    english: What kind of men are your type? I guess I like kind people or funny people, you know?
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    nuance: 「優しい人」 and 「面白い人」 are examples of the speaker's preferences, using 「かな」 to soften the statement
      and seek confirmation or agreement. The trailing 「かな」 adds a touch of coyness.

      suggesting there might have been other stylish items.

post_example_writeup: Remember that while や can list multiple items, it doesn't necessarily need to list
  more than two. Even with two items, it still carries the nuance of 'among other things'.

    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to や in that it lists examples, but とか can be used with both **nouns and verbs**,
      whereas や is restricted to nouns. とか often carries a more casual or slightly less definite nuance
      than や.

    meaning: Whether or, Things like, And … so on
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to や in listing examples, but やら～やら often conveys a sense of **disorder or being overwhelmed**
      by a list of things. It can also express 'whether A or B'.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember the core function of each particle. Use や for
  listing examples of nouns. Use と for complete lists of nouns. Use たり～たりする for listing a sequence of
  actions. Use とか for listing examples of nouns or verbs, often with a less formal tone. And use やら～やら
  when you want to express a sense of being overwhelmed or listing alternatives.
