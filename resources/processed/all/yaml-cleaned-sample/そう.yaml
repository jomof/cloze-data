  そうだ is one of the primary auxiliary verbs in Japanese and has multiple uses. This explanation focuses on the usage where そう indicates that something **looks** or **appears** to be a certain way, based on visual observation. It conveys a sense of 'seems like', 'looks like', or 'appears as though'. This form of そう is attached to the stem form (連用形) of verbs and adjectives.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **い-Adjectives:** When used with negative い-adjectives (ない), the い is dropped, and さ is inserted between な and そう, resulting in なさそう. For example, 汚い (kitanai - messy) becomes 汚くなさそう (kitanakunasasō - doesn't seem messy).
  *  **Verbs:** When used with the negative form of verbs (ない), simply remove the い from ない and attach そう directly. For example, 帰る (kaeru - to return) becomes 帰らない (kaeranai - not to return), and then 帰らなそう (kaeranasō - doesn't seem like returning).
  *  **Basis of Judgment:** This そう is used for making predictions or guesses based on **visual information**. It implies a lower degree of certainty compared to みたい. Avoid using it for obvious situations where the outcome is clear.
  *  **Comparison with みたい:** While both そう and みたい can express 'seems like', みたい generally suggests a higher degree of confidence or is used when drawing comparisons. そう relies more on immediate visual impressions.
