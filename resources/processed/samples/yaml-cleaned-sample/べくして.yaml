writeup: べくして is a formal expression indicating that something happened as a natural consequence or as
  was expected. It combines the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb べし (**should**, **ought
  to**), which becomes べく, and the conjunctive particle して. The nuance is that the outcome was almost
  inevitable given the circumstances. It often conveys a sense of **logical conclusion** or **predestination**.
  You'll often see the same verb repeated before and implied after べくして.
