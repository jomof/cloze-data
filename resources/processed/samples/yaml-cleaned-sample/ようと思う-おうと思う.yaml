writeup: |-
  The expression **〜ようと思う** (or **〜おうと思う**) is formed by combining the volitional form of a verb (う/よう form) with the verb 思う. This construction conveys the speaker's intention or decision to do something. It's similar to saying "I think I will..." or "I'm going to..." in English.

  Remember that the volitional form (う/よう) itself expresses intention, but adding 思う adds a nuance of consideration or having made a decision. It indicates that the speaker has thought about doing something and has arrived at the point of intending to do it.

  You'll also often see this expression with 思っている (**〜ようと思っている**). This emphasizes that the intention is something the speaker has been thinking about for some time or considers regularly. When describing someone else's intentions, you can use 思っている as discussed in the 思う grammar point lesson.

  **Important Consideration:** Be careful not to confuse the auxiliary verb よう with the similar-sounding ようだ. They have different meanings and grammatical functions.

    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「〜ようかと思ってるんだけど…」 is a softer way of suggesting something, often used in intimate
      or early romantic contexts. The trailing off 「…」 invites a response. The use of 「でも」 makes it sound
      less like a firm plan and more like a suggestion. This is something a male speaker might say to
      a female he is interested in.
    etymology: The 「か」 at the end of 「食べようか」 turns the volitional form into a question/suggestion.

    meaning: To try to
    kind: synonym

      happens, rather than a firm intention.
  - term: Verb[よう]
    meaning: Let's, I shall (Casual volitional)
    kind: synonym

      compared to the more considered intention of 〜ようと思う.
  - term: とおもう
    meaning: I think
    kind: synonym
    nuance: とおもう simply means "I think" and expresses an opinion or belief, whereas 〜ようと思う specifically

    meaning: To plan to, To intend to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: つもりだ also expresses intention, but it often implies a more concrete plan or determination
      than the slightly more tentative nuance of 〜ようと思う.

  the action and formed an intention. てみる focuses on the act of trying, Verb[よう] is a direct expression
  of will, とおもう expresses thought or opinion, and つもりだ suggests a more solid plan. Pay attention to the
  context to choose the most appropriate expression.
