writeup: |-
  **際に (sai ni)** is a formal expression that translates to "when," "at the time of," "in case of," or "on the occasion of." The noun **際 (sai)** itself means "verge" or "edge," implying a significant moment or event.

  It is used to describe a specific time or situation when an action takes place. You'll find it following verbs in their dictionary or past tense form, and nouns are followed by **の**.

  Think of 際に as highlighting a more **formal** or **important** occasion compared to the more casual **時 (toki)**. It's often used for rules, procedures, or when discussing potential events that might require specific actions.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While 際に and 時に can overlap, 際に is generally used for more significant or potentially impactful events. Using 際に for everyday, unchanging routines can sound unnatural.
  *  際に often implies a need for a specific action or procedure to be followed.
  *  The event described by 際に is often temporary or a one-off event, although it can be used for regularly occurring events if the reaction to that event might change based on circumstances.
