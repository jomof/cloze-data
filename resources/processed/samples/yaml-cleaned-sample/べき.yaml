  The auxiliary verb **べき**, being the attributive form of **べし**, is a structure in Japanese that is often paired with verbs to express that something "ought to be done". It implies some sort of moral obligation, or that (A) is the only reasonable course of action. This comes from the kanji **可き**, which carries the meaning of being something "permissible" (indicating that any other action would not be acceptable). **べき** will be paired with the plain (non-past) form of a verb, before being followed by either **だ**, or another noun.

  **べき** is also sometimes translated as "must do (A)", or "should do (A)" but it is important to remember that it will always have the nuance of being the only "permissible" choice, and is therefore very strong.

  **Caution:** It is important to note that the verb appearing with **べき** cannot be in past tense, and you will need to use **だった** or **でした** after **べき**, if you would like to say that something "ought to have been done" in the past.

  **Fun Fact:** In modern Japanese, there are only 18 auxiliary verbs, of which **べき** is not one. **べし** (the standard form) is considered to be a classical auxiliary verb. Due to this, **べき** (and **べし**) are often referred to as classical auxiliary verbs.

  **Fun Fact:** The combination of **する** and **べき** is a rare grammatical exception in Japanese, in which two forms are both considered equally correct. Due to this, either **するべき**, or **すべき** may be used.
