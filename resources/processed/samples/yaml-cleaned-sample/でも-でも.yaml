writeup: The grammar point 「〜でも〜でも」 expresses the idea of selecting from multiple possibilities or stating
  that something applies regardless of the options. It translates to "whether it is (A) or (B)" or "neither
  (A) nor (B)" depending on the sentence's overall meaning. The particle 「でも」 is used twice to list these
  options. When the sentence has a positive outcome, it implies that either option is acceptable. When
  the sentence has a negative outcome, it implies that neither option is acceptable or will be done.

  the overall context of the sentence (positive or negative outcome) to understand whether it means "whether...or"
  or "neither...nor".

    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「〜でも〜でも」, 「かどうか」 is used to ask or express uncertainty about whether a single event
      or situation is true or will happen. It doesn't present multiple distinct options in the same way.
  - term: にしても～にしても
    meaning: Regardless of whether
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar in meaning to 「〜でも〜でも」, 「にしても〜にしても」 often carries a nuance of acknowledging

      the outcome is the same in either case.
  - term: ～ても～なくても
    meaning: Whether ~ or not
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「～ても～なくても」 specifically focuses on whether an action is done or not done. It's generally used
      with verbs and highlights the contrast between doing something and not doing it.
  - term: にしろ～にしろ
    meaning: Whether… or
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「にしても～にしても」, 「にしろ～にしろ」 presents alternatives, but it can sometimes carry a slightly
      more formal tone than 「〜でも〜でも」.
post_false_friends_writeup: While these grammar points share the idea of presenting alternatives, their
  specific nuances and usage contexts differ. 「かどうか」 is about a single condition, while 「〜でも〜でも」, 「にしても〜にしても」,
  and 「にしろ〜にしろ」 present multiple distinct options. 「～ても～なくても」 specifically focuses on the presence or
  absence of an action.
