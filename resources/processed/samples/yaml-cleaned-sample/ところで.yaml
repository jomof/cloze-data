  **ところで (tokorode)** is a conjunction particle that acts like the English phrases "by the way" or "incidentally." It's used to smoothly introduce a completely new topic into a conversation. Think of it as a way to signal a shift in focus. It's constructed from the noun **ところ (tokoro)**, meaning "place," and the particle **で (de)**, indicating location or means, but in this context, the combination creates a conjunction. The nuance is that the previous topic has reminded the speaker of something else entirely.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **New Topic Introduction:** The key function of ところで is to bring up something unrelated to the current discussion. Don't use it to continue a point you were already making.
  *  **Sentence Initial:** ところで usually appears at the very beginning of a sentence.
  *  **Contrast with たところで:** Be careful not to confuse ところで with **たところで**, which has a completely different meaning indicating that something is not the case despite a prior action or condition. This is a more advanced grammar point.

false_friends:
  - term: そういえば
    meaning: Speaking of which, By the way, Come to think of it
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ところで, そういえば is often used to bring up a related thought or something that was just
      remembered based on the previous conversation. It's not always a completely new topic.
  - term: といえば
    meaning: Speaking of, If it were the case that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ところで, といえば is used to introduce a topic that is directly related to something previously
      mentioned or as a conditional phrase.
post_false_friends_writeup: While ところで, そういえば, and といえば can all sometimes translate to "by the way," their
  underlying nuances differ. Use ところで when you want to introduce a completely new and unrelated topic.
  Use そういえば when a previous point reminds you of something else. Use といえば when you're elaborating on a
  previously mentioned topic or setting up a conditional statement.
