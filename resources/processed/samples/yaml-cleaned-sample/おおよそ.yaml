writeup: |-
  「おおよそ」 is an adverb that means "approximately," "roughly," or "about." It can be written as およそ or 大凡, and less commonly as 凡そ. While interchangeable with other similar words, 「おおよそ」 often carries a slightly more formal nuance and is frequently used in announcements or situations where a precise number isn't necessary or available.

  **Key characteristics of 「おおよそ」:**

  *  It's an **adverb**, so it modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
  *  It's often placed at the **beginning of a sentence** or directly before the quantity or time it modifies.
  *  It implies an **estimation** or a general idea rather than an exact figure.

  **Etymology:** The kanji 大 (おお) means "big" or "great," and 凡 (よそ) means "common" or "ordinary." Combining them suggests a general or broad estimation.

  - japanese: この物件から最寄りの駅までは徒歩で{およそ|大凡}１０分かかります。
    english: It takes approximately 10 minutes to walk to the nearest train station from this property.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The speaker is providing an estimate of the travel time. 「徒歩で」 specifies the mode of transportation.
    etymology: 物件 (ぶっけん) literally means 'thing' + 'item', referring to a property.
  - japanese: 私は{おおよそ|大凡}理解したけど、周りの子達はポカーンとした表情で先生を見ていた。
    english: I understood most of it, but the people around me were looking at the teacher with a blank
      stare.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: 「ポカーンとした」 is onomatopoeia describing a state of being dumbfounded. The use of 「けど」 implies
      a contrast between the speaker's understanding and others' confusion.
