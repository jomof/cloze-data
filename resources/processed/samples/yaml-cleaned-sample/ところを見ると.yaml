  \u3068\u3053\u308d\u3092\u898b\u308b\u3068 is a fixed expression used to express a subjective judgment based on observation. It literally means something akin to "looking at the aspect of X," where X is the preceding clause. The speaker uses this structure to introduce their opinion or deduction after observing a particular situation or action.

  This grammar point directly follows a verb in its dictionary, past, present progressive, or ない form. Because it signals a subjective assessment based on an observation, the concluding part of the sentence often includes expressions like \u3060\u308d\u3046 (it seems), \u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044 (maybe), \u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046 (it's likely), or \u306d (isn't it?). These additions emphasize that the statement is the speaker's personal interpretation rather than a definitive fact.
