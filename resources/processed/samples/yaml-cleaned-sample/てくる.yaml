  The grammar point 「てくる」 combines the conjunctive particle 「て」 with the verb 「来る」(くる - to come). The basic meaning is that something happens and then "comes" to the present. This can describe a physical movement towards the speaker, a change over time, or a continuous action that started in the past and extends to the present.

  When used for physical movement, like 「帰ってくる」(kaette kuru - to return and come), it indicates returning to the speaker's location or a designated point. For changes over time, 「てくる」 signifies a gradual shift or development. For instance, 「寒くなってきた」(samuku natte kita - it has become cold) shows the process of getting colder.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The tense of 「くる」 determines the timing. Present tense 「てくる」 often implies an action happening now or in the near future, while past tense 「てきた」 indicates something that has already occurred.
  *  「てくる」 is the opposite of 「ていく」, which indicates movement away from the speaker or a progression into the future.
  *  While 「来る」 can be written in kanji (来る), in the 「てくる」 construction, it's often written in hiragana.
