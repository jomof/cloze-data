writeup: |-
  One of the more indirect ways that "to be concerning (A)" is conveyed in Japanese is through the pairing of a noun with the case marking particle を and the う-Verb 巡る "to go around" in its て-form, or standard form when paired with a second noun. This grammar point can be translated as "concerning (A)", "in regard to (A)", or "about (A)". However, following the most natural translation, we can see that "to go around the topic of (A)", or "encompassing (A)" are also acceptable.

  **Important Considerations**:

  *  This grammar point is quite formal.
  *  「を巡って」 keeps the "around the topic of (A)" nuance that comes from the stem verb. This implies considering many different viewpoints, and it's frequently used when there is a disagreement or dispute about (A).
  *  Because of this nuance, it can sound quite unnatural to use 「を巡って」 if the topic of (A) is simply a personal opinion.
