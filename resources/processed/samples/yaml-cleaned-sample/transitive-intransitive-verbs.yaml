  The two most fundamental divisions that can be made with Japanese verbs are **transitive verbs** - the subject is moving/acting upon something else, and **intransitive verbs** - the subject themself is moving/acting. Sometimes these terms are simplified even further to "other-move" (transitive), and "self-move" (intransitive).

  Basically, this is the difference between verbs that require an object marked with を (transitive verbs), and those that only require が, to show that the subject itself is moving (intransitive).

  In Japanese, there are many transitive/intransitive pairs of verbs, and these will need to be memorized.

  **Fun Fact**
  In Japanese, the two ways in which all verbs can be described are an act/motion (動作), and an act/motion upon something (作用).

  **Fun Fact**
  Although they are not traditionally grouped this way, する and なる may also be thought of as a transitive/intransitive pair. This is due to する always implying that something is being controlled (acted upon), while なる always implies that something happens on its own, or cannot be controlled.

post_example_writeup: Understanding the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs is crucial
  for constructing grammatically correct and natural-sounding Japanese sentences. Pay attention to the
  particle used to mark the subject or object of the verb, as this is a key indicator of whether a verb
  is transitive or intransitive.
