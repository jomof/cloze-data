writeup: 「とっくに」, which is the more common rendering of 「疾っくに」, is an adverb roughly translating to "long
  ago" or "already (a long time ago)". It's an emphatic form of 「とうに」 or the more literary 「疾うに」, though
  「疾うに」 is rarely used in modern conversation. 「とっくに」 functions as a sentence adverb, typically appearing
  at the beginning of a sentence or immediately before the verb it modifies. It emphasizes that an action
  or state happened or began significantly earlier than the present moment or a specific reference point.
  Compared to words like 「すでに」 and 「もう」, 「とっくに」 implies a more distant past or is used for dramatic emphasis.
  It's interesting to note that because the root meaning of 「疾し」 (hayashi) in older Japanese conveys the
  idea of "far earlier," using 「とっくに」 with a precise time marker is somewhat redundant, although not strictly
  incorrect, and less common.
