writeup: Although a combination of いつ "when", の, 間 "interval", に, and か; いつの間にか is a set expression that
  is used as a stand-alone adverb to mean "suddenly", or "without noticing". Literally, it just highlights
  an unknown interval within which something occurred, as seen by the question marking particle, か. **Important
  point:** Coming mainly from the inclusion of か, this grammar pattern often carries the nuance of surprise.
  When you want to convey the same feeling without the nuance of surprise, あっという間に may be used instead.
  This is a similar expression which literally means "in the blink of an eye" (or "in the time it takes
  to say あっ").
