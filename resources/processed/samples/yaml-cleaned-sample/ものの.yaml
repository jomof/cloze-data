writeup: ものの is a formal conjunction-particle used to indicate a contrast between two statements. It conveys
  that while the first statement (A) is true, the second statement (B) presents a situation that is contrary
  to what might be expected, is a different outcome, or cannot be directly inferred from (A). It emphasizes
  a sense of surprise or unexpectedness regarding the second part of the sentence. ものの can follow verbs
  in their plain form, い-adjectives, nouns followed by である, or な-adjectives followed by な. **Important:**
  The subject of both clauses connected by ものの must be the same.
