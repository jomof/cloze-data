writeup: |-
  さすが, which can also be written as 流石 in kanji, is an adverb used to express the speaker's impression that something has lived up to its reputation or expectations. It conveys a sense of agreement or admiration. In English, this is often translated as "as expected of (A)" or "that's just like (A)". As an adverb, さすが can appear at the beginning of a clause, sometimes with に, or directly before a noun using の.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While typically positive, さすが can occasionally have a negative nuance, similar to the English word "even". In such cases, it implies that even someone or something of high regard could not overcome a particular situation or difficulty.
  *  **Etymology**: The kanji for 流石 (ryūseki) is an example of 借字 (shakuji), meaning 'borrowed characters'. This indicates that the kanji were chosen for their phonetic sound (ryū and seki) and not for their inherent meaning. The connection between the kanji and the meaning of 「さすが」 is historical and not directly related to the characters' individual meanings.

false_friends:
  - term: はたして
    meaning: Wonder if ~ (really)?, Wonder how ~ (actually)?, Sure enough, As expected
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike さすが, はたして often carries a stronger sense of initial doubt or questioning before the
      expected outcome occurs or is confirmed.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both さすが and はたして can express that something turned out as expected,
  はたして often implies a period of uncertainty or questioning beforehand. さすが, on the other hand, expresses
  a more immediate recognition or confirmation of something's inherent quality or reputation.
