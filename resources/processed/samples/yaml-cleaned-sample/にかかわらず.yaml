  The expression **にかかわらず** is used to convey the meaning of "regardless of (A)", "no matter if (A)", or "with or without (A)". It indicates that something (B) happens or is true irrespective of a certain condition or factor (A). The literal construction breaks down as: **に** (particle), **かかわる** (u-verb meaning "to be affected" or "to be influenced"), and **ず** (literary auxiliary verb equivalent to ない). The core idea is "without being influenced by A, B occurs".

  にかかわらず can be used with:

  *  Verbs in dictionary form or negative plain form.
  *  Adjectives in dictionary form or negative plain form.
  *  Nouns directly.

  Often, the same word or phrase is repeated in both its positive and negative forms (e.g., 雨が降るか降らないか) or used with **かどうか** to emphasize the "whether or not" nuance. This grammar point emphasizes that (B) will occur or is true independently of (A). It can also imply that all types of (A) will lead to the same outcome (B).
