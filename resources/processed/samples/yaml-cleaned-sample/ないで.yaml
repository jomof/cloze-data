writeup: The grammar point ないで expresses that an action is performed **without** another action taking
  place. It connects two clauses where the first action (in the negative form + で) does not occur, and
  then the second action occurs. Think of it as saying "(B) happened without (A) happening first." It's
  formed by taking the negative plain form of a verb (ない-form) and adding で. This emphasizes that the
  second action was done in the absence of the first. For example, 「朝ご飯を食べないで学校へ行った」 means "I went to
  school without eating breakfast." The key is that the 'going to school' happened without the 'eating
  breakfast' preceding it. This is distinct from なくて, which often implies a reason or cause.
examples:
  - japanese: 晩ご飯を食べないで寝ちゃった。
    english: I went to sleep without eating dinner.
    conjugation: plain negative te-form
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker uses the 「ちゃった」 form, a contraction of 「てしまった」, which conveys a sense of completion
      or sometimes regret, common in casual speech.
  - japanese: 昨日はシャワーを浴びないで寝た。
    english: Yesterday, I went to bed without taking a shower.

    speaker_gender: male

  - japanese: 何も言わないで彼女は部屋を出て行った。
    english: Without saying anything, she left the room.

    conjugation: plain negative te-form

      of not eating breakfast.

    english: Um, it feels lonely to say goodbye without exchanging contact information.
    conjugation: plain negative te-form

      This might be said between close female friends.
post_example_writeup: Remember that the emphasis with ないで is on the second action occurring in the absence
  of the first. While similar in meaning to なくて, ないで focuses more on the sequence of actions rather than
  the causal relationship.
false_friends:
  - term: てください

    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike ないで which means "without doing," てください is a request to perform an action.
  - term: なさい
    meaning: Command to do
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike ないで, which indicates the absence of an action, なさい is a command or instruction to perform
      an action.
  - term: ないでください
    meaning: Please don't (Polite request)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While ないで indicates doing something without doing something else, ないでください is a polite request
      to refrain from doing something.
  - term: な
    meaning: Do not, Don't (Prohibitive)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to ないでください, な is a prohibitive form meaning "don't do," whereas ないで describes an action
      done in the absence of another.
  - term: ずに
    meaning: Without doing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ずに is a more formal synonym of ないで, both indicating an action done without another.
  - term: なくて (not)
    meaning: To not ~ and ~, Not ~ and ~ (Conjugations)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Both なくて and ないで can mean "without doing," but なくて often carries a stronger sense of reason
      or cause, while ないで emphasizes the sequence of actions.
  - term: Verb[ないで]
    meaning: (Please) do not (for me), Casual request
    kind: synonym
    nuance: This usage of Verb[ないで] as a casual request to not do something is different from the standard
      ないで indicating 'without doing'.
  - term: なくて (not)
    meaning: Not ~ and, Not so, Because not (Examples)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: In some examples, なくて can function similarly to ないで in describing a lack of something, but
      it frequently implies a stronger causal relationship.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between ないで and similar expressions, remember that ないで
  specifically describes an action being performed in the absence of another. For requests not to do something,
  use ないでください or な. For expressing a reason or cause, なくて is often more appropriate. While ずに is a synonym,
  it's generally more formal than ないで.
