  やら is an adverbial particle in Japanese which expresses a lack of determination or limitation regarding the items it connects. It's similar to structures like など, often translating to "(A) and so on" or "(A) and the like." やら can follow verbs in their dictionary form, nouns, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives.

  When repeated as (A)やら(B)やら, both (A) and (B) are often the same word type, though this isn't strictly necessary, especially when expressing various feelings.

  Compared to とか, やら emphasizes the broad scope of things within the mentioned category. It suggests that (A) and (B) are just a small sample from a larger, more complex set of emotions, actions, etc.

  **Important Consideration:** When used as のやら～のやら, it highlights the speaker's uncertainty between the two options. In these cases, (A) and (B) are often antonyms or opposites, but not always.
