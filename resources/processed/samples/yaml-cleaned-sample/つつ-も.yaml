writeup: |-
  **つつ(も)** builds upon the base meaning of **つつ**, which indicates performing action B while action A is ongoing. Adding **も** introduces the nuance of "even though" or "despite". Therefore, the structure implies a sense of contradiction or unexpectedness between the two actions.

  Action A, marked by the ます-stem of a verb followed by **つつも**, is the ongoing action. Action B is the resulting event, which is often contrary to what one might expect given action A.

  Like **つつ**, **つつも** typically describes a non-physical or mental action in the A clause (e.g., knowing, thinking, listening, reading). The B clause can describe either a physical or non-physical action.

  It's worth noting the similarity between **つつも** and **ながらも**. While both express a sense of doing something despite another action, **つつも** exclusively connects to verbs, whereas **ながらも** can follow a wider range of word types.

post_example_writeup: As illustrated in the examples, **つつも** highlights the contrast between expectation
  and reality. The action in the first clause might logically lead to a certain outcome, but the second
  clause presents a different, often surprising, result. For instance, knowing something is dangerous
  would typically deter someone, yet the first example shows the person entering the cave anyway. This
  inherent tension is a key characteristic of **つつも**.

post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  While **つつも**, **ものの**, **くせに**, and **ながらも** all convey a sense of doing something despite a certain condition, there are subtle differences in their usage.

  **つつも** is relatively formal and specifically attaches to the ます-stem of verbs, typically describing a background state or action that contrasts with the main action. **ものの** is more versatile and can connect clauses with a broader range of relationships, not just direct contradiction. It often emphasizes a sense of acknowledgement or recognition of the first clause. **くせに** carries a nuance of reproach or blame, often implying that the second action is unreasonable given the circumstances described in the first clause. Finally, **ながらも** is less formal than **つつも** and can follow nouns and adjectives in addition to verbs, offering a broader applicability.

  To avoid confusion, consider the formality and the specific nuance you want to express. If you need a formal expression tied to a verb describing a contradictory situation, **つつも** is a suitable choice. If the situation calls for a less formal tone or involves non-verbs, **ながらも** might be more appropriate. If there's an element of surprise or negativity, **くせに** could be considered, and if you want to emphasize acknowledgement, **ものの** is a good option.
