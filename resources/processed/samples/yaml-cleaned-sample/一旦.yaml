writeup: '**一旦** (ittan) functions as an adverb, signifying a brief pause or a point of no easy return.
  It often translates to "once," implying that upon the completion of the first action, the subsequent
  state is somewhat fixed or difficult to reverse, at least for a while. When used with conditional forms
  like ～ば, ～と, or ～たら, it emphasizes the hypothetical scenario and often suggests a negative consequence
  or difficulty in reverting to the previous condition. It can also mean "for the time being" or "for
  now," indicating a temporary measure. Interestingly, **一旦** originates from the noun **一旦** meaning
  "one morning" or "one brief period." The kanji **旦** (tan) itself signifies "daybreak" or "dawn," offering
  a helpful mnemonic - think of **一旦** as the dawning of a new, somewhat irreversible phase.'
