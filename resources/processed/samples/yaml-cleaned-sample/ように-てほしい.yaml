writeup: |-
  The grammar point **ように～てほしい** combines the auxiliary verb **ようだ** (meaning "like", "similar to") in its adverbial form **ように**, with the **てほしい** structure. **てほしい** expresses a desire for someone else to do something. Therefore, **ように～てほしい** indicates that you (or someone else) want someone to perform an action *in a certain way* or *so that a certain condition is met*.

  * **ようだ (you da)** becomes **ように (you ni)** when modifying a verb.
  * When **ように** follows a noun, the particle **の (no)** is required (e.g., スポーツ選手のように).
  * The person you want to do something is usually marked with **に (ni)**. However, **が (ga)** may sometimes be used, especially when referring to events or objects, or to avoid repetition of **に** in the sentence.

  **Important Considerations:**

  * This grammar point focuses on the *manner* or *desired outcome* of an action.
  * The nuance is that the speaker has a specific way they want something done or a specific result they hope for.
