writeup: As explained in the grammar point for 「そんな」, the こそあど言葉（ことば） may occasionally be seen in the
  forms 「こんな」, 「そんな」, 「あんな」, or 「どんな」. 「どんな」 itself is an abbreviation of 「どのような」, meaning "in what way"
  or "what kind of". When partnered with 「に」 (creating an adverb), and 「ても」, 「どんなに〜ても」 is used to express
  an extent of something that is insufficient. It can be translated as "no matter how (A), (B)". 「どんなに」
  may be attached to any type of word, so long as that word is then followed by 「でも」 (in the case of nouns
  or な-adjectives) or 「ても」 (in the case of い-adjectives or verbs). 「どんなに〜ても」 can literally be translated
  as "even if (A) is in however/whatever (way), (B)".
