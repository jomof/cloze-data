  「と思いきや」 is an expression used in Japanese to indicate that something turned out to be different from what one initially thought. It conveys a sense of surprise or unexpectedness. A common translation is "despite having thought (A), (B)" or "when I thought that (A), it was actually (B)".

  Literally, 「と思いきや」 combines the quotative particle 「と」, the conjunctive form of the verb 「思う」 (omou - to think), the classical auxiliary verb 「き」 (ki), which indicates past tense or a perfective aspect, and the classical binding particle 「や」 (ya), similar to 「か」 (ka) and marking a question (rhetorical in this case).

  However, in modern Japanese, 「と思いきや」 is primarily understood as an emphatic structure that highlights the speaker's surprise at a situation being contrary to their expectation. It can follow a word in its plain form.

  The particle 「か」 may precede 「と思いきや」 (e.g., 「かと思いきや」), further emphasizing the rhetorical question and surprise.

  **Important Consideration:** The clause following 「と思いきや」 always describes the actual situation, which is different from the initial thought or expectation, and is therefore typically in the past tense.

    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「と思いきや」 which focuses on the contrast between an expectation and reality, 「かと思ったら」
      and 「かと思うと」 describe a quick change of state or action immediately following an initial thought
      or observation.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「かと思ったら」 and 「かと思うと」 share the element of surprise with 「と思いきや」, they
  emphasize a more immediate shift or a sequence of events rather than a discrepancy between expectation
  and reality. When using 「と思いきや」, the focus is on the speaker's incorrect initial assumption. With 「かと思ったら」/「かと思うと」,
  the focus is on the rapid transition or change that occurs.
