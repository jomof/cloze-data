writeup: |-
  When combined with the adverbial particle は, 以上 is frequently translated as "since (A), (B)", "now that (A), (B)", or "as long as (A), (B)". This is a formal structure that is rarely found in daily speech. This construction may be used with verbs and い-Adjectives in their standard forms, and な-Adjectives or nouns followed by である以上は. As with many other grammar points, the particle は is often dropped, leaving 以上 by itself.

  Due to である以上は often presenting something which is being acted upon, the (B) part of sentences that include this grammar structure will frequently include the resolutions or intentions of the speaker, and can be thought of as either obvious or necessary once considering (A). This usually appears in the form of べきだ, つもりだ, はずだ, たい, ほうがいい, and similar patterns.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The literal meaning of "above and beyond (A), (B)" is also a good way to remember this grammar pattern, as it basically highlights that anything 'past', 'beyond', or 'above' (A) is what needs to be considered.
