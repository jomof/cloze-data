etymology: This grammar point combines の (a nominalizer), も (particle indicating 'also' or 'even'), and
  最も (mottomo), a な-adjective meaning 'most reasonable' or 'justifiable,' plus the copula だ. The の turns
  the preceding clause into a noun-like phrase, which then becomes the subject being deemed 'reasonable.'
writeup: |-
  のももっともだ is a combination of の, も, the な-Adjective もっとも, meaning "reasonable" or "plausible", and the auxiliary verb だ. In many cases, the interpretation will be "it may well be (A)", "it's only natural that (A)", or "there's no wonder that (A)". However, もっとも itself is simply an adjective that affirms that the speaker understands the thought process behind (A), and that it is logical to them, regardless of whether or not they actually agree with it themselves. Due to this, "it may well be (A)" in English is actually a very close translation of the feeling behind the expression. のももっともだ will appear with verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, and nouns. In the case of nouns, the の will often be dropped, as the noun itself will become the expression being marked as the focus.

  Because のももっともだ is used when the speaker is expressing that they understand the underlying reasons behind something, phrases used for explanation such as から or ので will often be seen in the same sentence.
