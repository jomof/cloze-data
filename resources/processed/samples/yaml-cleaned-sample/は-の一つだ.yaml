  - term: ～のうち(で)
    meaning: Of the, Among(st)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「～は～の一つだ」 which focuses on identifying one item within a larger group, 「～のうちで」 emphasizes
      the selection or comparison *within* that group. For example, 「多くの候補者のうちで、彼が一番良い」 (Among the many
      candidates, he is the best) highlights a comparison, whereas 「彼は候補者の一人だ」 (He is one of the candidates)
      simply states his membership in the group.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「～は～の一つだ」 and 「～のうちで」 deal with groups, the former is used to identify
  an item's membership in a category, and the latter is used to make comparisons or selections *within*
  that category. Avoid using 「～のうちで」 when you simply want to state that something is one of many.
