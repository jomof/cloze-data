writeup: |-
  「やがて」 is an adverb that appears at the beginning of sentences to indicate that a certain state, which does not exist at the moment, will happen within an unspecified (usually short) amount of time. It can be translated as "before long," "in the end," or "eventually." It often carries a nuance of something happening naturally or as expected over time.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  「やがて」 is typically written in hiragana.
  *  When 「やがて」 is used with a specific time duration, it can mean "nearly." For example, 「やがて２年」 means "nearly two years."
  *  Originally, 「やがて」 expressed something that had not yet occurred and had broader meanings such as "namely" or "immediately," implying something expected or known was about to happen.

  **Usage nuances:**

  *  When used to mean "before long" or "eventually," it suggests a natural progression of time.
  *  When used to mean "all too soon," it often carries a subtle feeling of time passing quickly, sometimes with a hint of regret or inevitability.

      making the encounter feel more significant as a milestone approaches.
