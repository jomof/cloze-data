  どうにも is an expression that indicates a sense of helplessness or resignation. It's often paired with negative verb forms or expressions indicating impossibility, such as できない ("cannot"), ならない ("won't happen"), or ようがない ("there's no way"). Think of it as meaning "no matter what, it's impossible" or "there's nothing one can do about it."

  **Key points:**
  *  It emphasizes the lack of control or ability to change a situation.
  *  It often expresses the speaker's frustration or resignation.
  *  It can appear at the beginning or end of a sentence, setting the tone for the impossibility of something.
  *  The intensified form **どうにもこうにも** further emphasizes the feeling of being stuck or unable to do anything.
  *  While often about the speaker's inability, it can also describe a general impossibility or someone else's inability due to external factors.
