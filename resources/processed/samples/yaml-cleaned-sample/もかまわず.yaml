  **も構わず** combines the particle **も** with the **う-verb** 構う (kamau), meaning "to mind" or "to care", and the literary auxiliary verb **ず**, which functions similarly to **ない** and conveys the same meaning. It expresses the idea of performing an action in disregard of or without concern for something.

  The basic structure is: **Xも構わず、Y**. Here, **X** represents the thing being disregarded, and **Y** is the action taken without considering **X**. This structure can follow:

  *  Verbs (often in their dictionary form or past tense)
  *  い-adjectives
  *  な-adjectives + な
  *  Nouns (sometimes with the addition of **の**)

  The particle **に** can replace **も** for added emphasis.

post_example_writeup: '**も構わず** emphasizes a lack of consideration or concern. The action described in
  the **Y** part of the sentence proceeds despite the potential obstacle or negative consequence mentioned
  in the **X** part. The nuance is often one of deliberate disregard or a sense of urgency that overrides
  normal considerations.'

  While **も構わず** expresses a lack of worry or consideration, **をものともせず** indicates overcoming a significant difficulty or obstacle. The focus of **をものともせず** is on successfully acting despite a challenge. For example, "多くの困難をものともせず、彼は夢を叶えた" (Despite many difficulties, he achieved his dream).

  **をよそに** means ignoring something happening around you, often something that would typically be of concern or interest. The emphasis is on deliberately turning a blind eye to the surrounding situation. An example would be, "周りの騒ぎをよそに、彼は本を読んでいた" (Ignoring the commotion around him, he was reading a book).
