writeup: '～というのは事実だ is a phrase used to strongly assert that something (preceding 「というのは」) is a **factual
  truth** or something about which there is **no doubt**. The literal breakdown of this phrase is: 「という」
  (that which is said) + 「の」 (nominalizer) + 「は」 (topic marker) + 「事実だ」 (is a fact). Essentially, it means
  "the thing that is said is a fact." It''s also common to omit 「というのは」, making the statement slightly
  less emphatic but still conveying the same core meaning.'
