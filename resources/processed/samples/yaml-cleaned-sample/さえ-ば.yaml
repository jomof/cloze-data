writeup: |-
  The set expression **さえ～ば** combines the adverbial particle **さえ** and the conjunction particle **ば**. It's used to emphasize a necessary condition for something else to happen. Think of it as highlighting the *minimum* requirement. The structure translates to "if only (A), then (B)", "as long as (A), (B)", or "the only thing needed for (B) is (A)".

  **さえ** can attach to various parts of speech. When it follows a verb, the verb must be in the **conditional form (ば-form)**. It can also follow other particles to create more nuanced meanings.

  The **ば** particle itself indicates a hypothetical situation. So, **さえ～ば** presents a scenario where **only** a specific condition being met is enough for the desired outcome.
