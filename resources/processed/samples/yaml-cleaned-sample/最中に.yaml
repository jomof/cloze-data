  While 中に highlights that something is in the process of happening (when used in relation to events/actions), 最中に strengthens that meaning further, to show that something is "right in the middle of happening." As the kanji 最 means "utmost", we can see that the literal meaning is "utmost middle." This can be translated similarly to phrases like "at the height of (A)" or "in the midst of (A)" in English.

  When using 最中に, the (B) part of the sentence will usually highlight something else that happened during (A), somehow interrupting or disturbing it.

  To use 最中に, attach it to the end of the ている form of a verb or a noun followed by の.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  最中 may occasionally be used with adjectives, but this is uncommon. In these cases, the meaning is to be at the "pinnacle" of whatever the adjective is describing (usually a feeling/emotion).

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 最中に with similar expressions, remember that 最中に emphasizes
  being **right in the middle** of an action or state, often with an implication of interruption. Other
  expressions like ～ところに, 途中に, or とき might indicate a general time or location within an event, but they
  don't carry the same nuance of being deeply immersed in the process. Think of 最中に as highlighting the
  peak or most active phase of an event when something else occurs.
