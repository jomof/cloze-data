  The grammar point 最中に (さいちゅうに) emphasizes that something occurs **right in the middle of an action or event**. While 中に (ちゅうに) also means "in the middle of," 最中に adds a stronger sense of being at the **peak or height** of the ongoing activity when something else happens, often unexpectedly or interruptively. The kanji 最 (さい) meaning "utmost" reinforces this idea of being at the most intense point. Think of it like the English phrases "in the midst of" or "at the height of".

  最中に is attached to:

  *  The **ている form of a verb**: \[Verb (て form)] + いる + 最中に
  *  A **noun followed by の**: \[Noun] + の + 最中に

  It's important to note that while occasionally used with adjectives to describe being at the peak of a feeling, this usage is less common.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 最中に carries a stronger nuance of being **right
  in the middle of something important or intense** when an interruption occurs. While the other expressions
  can indicate something happening during a certain time, 最中に specifically highlights the **interruption
  at the peak** of the action. For instance, if you want to emphasize that the phone rang while you were
  deeply engrossed in reading, 最中に would be more appropriate than simply saying 読んでいるとき (when I was reading).
