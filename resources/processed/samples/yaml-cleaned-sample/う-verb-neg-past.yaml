writeup: To form the negative past tense of う-verbs, you'll modify the verb's ending. For the casual form,
  change the final う-sound kana to the corresponding あ-sound kana (or わ if the kana is う), and then add
  **なかった**. For the polite form, change the final う-sound kana to the corresponding い-sound kana and add
  **ませんでした**. This form indicates that something "did not happen" or "was not." A common semi-polite form
  is created by adding **です** to the casual **なかった**, although grammatically it's a bit informal. An exception
  is the verb **ある**, where the casual negative past is simply **なかった**, not あらなかった. However, the polite
  form is the expected **ありませんでした**.
