writeup: '**いきなり** is an adverb that means "suddenly," "all of a sudden," or "for no reason." It describes
  actions or events that happen abruptly and without any prior warning. While rarely written in kanji
  (行き成り), the origin of the word hints at a sudden unfolding of a situation. Therefore, beyond simply
  meaning "suddenly," it can sometimes carry the nuance of an unexpected turn of events.'

  unnoticed, and たちまち emphasizes speed or immediacy.'
