  そこで (very rarely seen as 其処で) is a conjunction that combines そこ "there" and the case-marking particle で. It indicates a logical consequence or a decision made based on a preceding situation. Think of it as the English equivalents "accordingly", "therefore", or "to that end." Literally, it means "at that place" or "in that situation," with で implying the means or context for the following action or decision.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Causality:** そこで links a cause or situation in the first clause to a resulting action or decision in the second clause.
  *  **Volition:** The action described after そこで is usually something that can be controlled or decided upon. It's less common to use そこで when describing purely natural or uncontrollable consequences.
  *  **Similar to 'as such':** You can often think of そこで as working similarly to the English phrase "as such," where a situation is stated, and then a resulting action or conclusion is presented.

      him mine.
    register: semi-formal

    etymology: The etymology of 「そこで」, combining 「そこ」 and 「で」, highlights the idea of taking action 'at
      that place/situation'.

post_example_writeup: While そこで indicates a logical connection, it's important to ensure the action following
  そこで is a deliberate decision or action taken *because* of the preceding situation. The example "信号が赤になったのでブレーキをかけた。そこで、後ろの車に私の車をぶつけられた"
  is marked as unnatural because getting hit by another car is not a controllable action resulting from
  braking; it's an external event. Phrases like その結果 (as a result) or すると (and then) might be more appropriate
  in such cases.
false_friends:
  - term: その結果
    meaning: As a result
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike そこで, その結果 focuses more directly on the outcome or consequence, even if it's not a deliberate
      action.
  - term: すると
    meaning: Having done..., If...is done..., (And/just) then, Thereupon, If so
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike そこで, すると often describes a sequence of events or a natural consequence, not necessarily
      a deliberate decision.
  - term: そのため(に)
    meaning: For that reason, Because of that, To that end
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to そこで, ため(に) indicates a reason, but it can sometimes feel more explicitly causal
      than そこで.
  - term: したがって
    meaning: Therefore, Thus, As a result
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike そこで, したがって is more formal and often used in written or more formal spoken contexts
      to present a logical conclusion.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that そこで emphasizes the speaker's deliberate
  action or decision in response to a situation. While the other expressions also indicate consequence,
  they may focus more on the natural outcome (その結果, すると), the reason itself (そのため(に)), or present a more
  formal logical conclusion (したがって). Consider whether the second clause describes a conscious choice or
  a natural, perhaps uncontrollable, event.
