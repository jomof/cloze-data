writeup: にて is a formal case-marking particle often considered a standalone particle, although it originates
  from the combination of に and the conjunctive particle て. It functions similarly to で, conveying meanings
  like "with (A)," "by (A)," "at (A)," or "using (A)." にて typically follows nouns indicating a means,
  method, time, location, reason, or origin that the speaker wishes to emphasize. Due to its formality,
  にて is more common in writing and formal announcements. で is the more natural choice in casual conversation.

post_example_writeup: にて provides a more formal alternative to で. It's important to recognize its formal
  nuance and use it in appropriate contexts, such as formal announcements, written communication, or situations
  requiring a heightened level of politeness. While で is suitable for most everyday situations, にて adds
  a touch of formality and is often preferred in professional settings or when addressing a wider audience.
false_friends:
  - term: で (at)
    meaning: At, In
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike にて, で is used in both formal and casual contexts. It's the more versatile and common
      particle for indicating location or means.
  - term: に
    meaning: In, At, To, For, On
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While に can also indicate location and time, it doesn't inherently carry the same sense of
      "by means of" that にて does. に has a wider range of uses, including indicating direction and purpose.
  - term: において・における
    meaning: In, On, At, Regarding, In terms of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike にて, において/における specifically indicates a place, time, or situation in which something
      occurs or is considered. It often carries a more academic or analytical nuance than にて.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that で is the general-purpose particle for 'at,'
  'in,' 'with,' or 'by.' Use にて when you want to sound more formal, particularly in written communication
  or announcements. において and における are even more formal and are best suited for academic or official contexts
  where you want to specify the setting or scope of a topic.
