  **向き (muki)** is a noun that often functions as a suffix, derived from the intransitive verb **向く (muku)**, meaning "to face". When attached to another noun, **向き** indicates that something is naturally facing towards or is suitable for that noun. It suggests an inherent compatibility or direction, rather than something being specifically designed for it.

  A key point of comparison is with **向け (muke)**, which comes from the transitive verb **向ける (mukeru)**, meaning "to turn towards" or "to direct". **向け** more strongly implies that something has been specifically designed or intended for a particular purpose or audience.

  Think of it this way: **向き** is about inherent suitability or natural orientation, while **向け** is about intentional design or direction. For example, a room might be 南向き (minami muki - south-facing) due to its natural orientation. A product, however, would be 子供向け (kodomo muke - intended for children) because it was designed with children in mind.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Intransitive vs. Transitive:** Remember that **向き** comes from an intransitive verb, emphasizing a natural state or direction.
  *  **Suitability vs. Intent:** **向き** suggests something is appropriate or fitting, while **向け** implies something is specifically targeted.
  *  **Context is Key:** Pay attention to the context to discern whether **向き** or **向け** is the more appropriate choice.

  *matched*, use **に合わせて** or **に合った**.
