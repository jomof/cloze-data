  `に応えて` is a construction formed from `に` and the て-form of the る-Verb `応える` (kotaeru). It's often translated as "to meet (A)" or "in response to (A)." Similar to `に応じて` ("in accordance with"), `に応えて` indicates that action (B) is taken because it is considered necessary, suitable, or appropriate based on the specific circumstances of (A).

  `に応えて` often appears in hiragana and attaches to the end of nouns, marking them as the (A) that the action is responding to. Alternatively, `に応える` is used when connecting directly to another noun. In many cases, (A) indicates a request, wish, or expectation.

  - term: に応じて
    meaning: Depending or based on, According to, In response to, Suitable for or to,
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike `に応えて`, `に応じて` emphasizes that something varies or is adjusted based on the circumstances.
      While both can mean 'in response to', `に応じて` highlights a correlation or adaptation, whereas `に応えて`
      focuses on directly meeting a specific need or request.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both `に応えて` and `に応じて` can translate to 'in response to', remember that
  `に応じて` implies a broader sense of 'depending on' or 'in accordance with', suggesting a more general
  adaptation. `に応えて` is more specific, indicating a direct reaction to fulfill a particular request or
  expectation.
