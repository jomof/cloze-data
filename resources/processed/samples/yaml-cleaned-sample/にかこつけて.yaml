writeup: '**にかこつけて** is used when someone uses a stated reason (often a legitimate one) as a cover for

  The basic structure is **Noun + にかこつけて** or **[Verb in dictionary form]の + にかこつけて**. The nuance is often
  critical, suggesting that the stated reason is not the primary or genuine motivation. Think of it as
