  The grammar point **ているあいだに** combines the **ている** form of a verb with **間に** to indicate that an action or event (B) occurs within the duration of another ongoing action or state (A). Think of it as saying "during the time that (A) is happening, (B) happens." The two events don't necessarily need to be related. The emphasis is on the timing of (B) falling within the timeframe of (A).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The action in the **ている** clause (A) is ongoing.
  *  The action in the **間に** clause (B) happens at some point within the duration of (A).
  *  The action in (B) can sometimes be something that happens beyond the speaker's control, but this isn't a strict rule.

post_false_friends_writeup: While many of these expressions share a similar meaning of 'while' or 'during',
  it's important to pay attention to the nuances. 「ながら」 requires simultaneous actions by the same person.
  「うちに」 often carries a sense of a limited time frame or opportunity. 「とき」 is a general 'when'. 「～ところに」
  and 「～ところへ」 often emphasize the timing of an unexpected event. Understanding these subtle differences
  will help you choose the most appropriate expression.
