writeup: The grammar point 「だけでなく(て)～も」 is used to express that not only is the first thing true or the
  case, but the second thing is also true or the case. It's similar to saying "not only A, but also B"
  in English. The 「だけでなく」 part indicates that something else is also included in addition to the first
  item. Adding the particle 「も」 to the second part of the sentence emphasizes that the second item is
  also significant or relevant in the same way as the first. While 「て」 is optional, its inclusion often
  makes the sentence flow more naturally, particularly in spoken Japanese. You can also use 「じゃなく(て)」
  as a more colloquial alternative to 「でなく(て)」.

post_false_friends_writeup: While many of these expressions share the core meaning of "not only... but
  also," they often differ in nuance and formality. 「はもとより」 and 「はもちろん」 can imply that the second item
  is obvious or to be expected. 「のみならず」 and 「ばかりでなく」 are more formal synonyms. 「ばかり」 has the opposite
  meaning, indicating exclusivity. 「をはじめ」 is used when introducing a list of examples. Pay attention to
  the specific context to choose the most appropriate expression.
