writeup: |-
  **相まって** is used to express that two or more factors work together to produce a certain result. It indicates a synergistic effect where the combined influence is greater than the sum of the individual parts. Essentially, it highlights how things mutually influence each other to bring about a particular outcome. The structure is typically **[A]と[B]が相まって[C]**, where A and B are the contributing factors, and C is the resulting situation or outcome. It can also be phrased as **[A]に[B]が相まって[C]**.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  This grammar point carries a formal tone.
  *  It emphasizes the combined effect, often suggesting that neither factor alone would be as impactful.
  *  While the kanji 俟つ (matsu, "to wait on") is part of the etymology, the expression is often written in hiragana due to the rarity of the verb in modern usage.

  **Etymology:**
  The term combines the kanji **相** (ai), meaning "mutual" or "reciprocal," with the て-form of the verb **俟つ** (matsu), meaning "to wait on" or "to depend on." The etymology suggests a sense of mutual dependence or waiting for each other to produce the final result.
