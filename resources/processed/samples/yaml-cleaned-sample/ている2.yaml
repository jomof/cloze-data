writeup: |-
  As mentioned in our first ている lesson, this construction is used to convey that someone or something is existing in a constant state of "doing" the verb that comes before て. Here we will take a closer look at several of the verbs that will be used with ている, to express "existing in a state of (A) having been done". All of these verbs would appear as the past form in English, after the initial thing has "started", "come", "died", or "gotten angry". However, this is not the case in Japanese. In Japanese, once something is angry, it exists in the state of being angry, once something has started, it exists in the state of being ongoing, once something dies, it exists in the state of being dead, and so on.

  **Fun Fact:** One of the easiest ways that you can tell whether a verb will use the ている form, or the past form, is to think about whether it can happen twice. Something cannot "start" twice, so it will use ている. Something cannot die twice, so it will use ている, etc. This does not work with every verb, but will help with over 90% of the verbs that require this form.

  Something has fallen and is already on the ground, so it cannot fall again. ている will be used.

  - japanese: ピアノが落ちている。
    english: The piano has fallen. (Existing in the state of having fallen)

false_friends:
  - term: ている①
    meaning: Is, Am, Are (~ing)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ている②」 which focuses on the resultant state of an action, 「ている①」 describes an ongoing
      action in the present moment.
  - term: ている③
    meaning: Has/have done, Is ~ing (Repetition)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ている③」 also describes a completed action, similar to 「ている②」, but it can also indicate repeated
      actions or habits, which 「ている②」 does not emphasize.
  - term: Verb + て
    meaning: And, Then (Linking events)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ている②」 which describes a state, "Verb + て" is used to link actions or events sequentially.
  - term: つづける
    meaning: To continue
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「ている②」 indicates a current state resulting from a past action, 「つづける」 explicitly means
      to continue an action, focusing on the continuation rather than the result.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「ている②」 emphasizes the **current state**
  as a result of a past action. If you want to describe an action that is **currently happening**, use
  「ている①」. If you want to **link actions**, use "Verb + て". If you want to say that an action **continues**,
  use 「つづける」.
