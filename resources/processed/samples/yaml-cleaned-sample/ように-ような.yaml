  The structure **ように** (youni) and **ような** (youna) expresses that something resembles or is in the manner of something else.

  **ように** is used to modify verbs and adverbs, indicating that an action is performed in a certain way or manner. It often translates to "like," "as if," or "in a way that."

  **ような** is used to modify nouns, describing something that has the characteristics of something else. It also translates to "like" or "as if" when describing a noun.

  Sometimes this structure expresses the speaker's uncertainty about the comparison being made. In such cases, it can be translated as "as if" or "as though."

post_example_writeup: Notice how **ように** connects to verbs (歩く - aruku) and the verb phrase (雨が降っている -
  ame ga futteiru), describing the manner of the action. In contrast, **ような** connects directly to nouns
  (亀 - kame, 工場 - koujou, 鬼 - oni, 目 - me, 顔 - kao, 10代 - juudai, 夢物語 - yumemonogatari) to describe their
  characteristics or nature.

post_false_friends_writeup: While several grammar points express similarity, **ように** and **ような** have
  a specific function in describing the manner of an action or the characteristics of a noun. Points like
  **そう** and **に見える** focus on visual impressions. **ようだ** expresses a judgment or deduction. **みたい**
  is a more casual equivalent. **とおり** emphasizes exactness rather than resemblance. When you want to
  say something is *like* something else in terms of its actions or attributes, **ように** and **ような** are
  often the most appropriate choices.
