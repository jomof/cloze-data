writeup: |-
  The structure **ように** (when modifying verbs or clauses) and **ような** (when modifying nouns) expresses similarity or resemblance. It indicates that something is being done or exists in a manner that is comparable to something else.

  Sometimes, this structure expresses the speaker's uncertainty about whether the comparison is accurate. In these cases, **ように** or **ような** can be translated as "as if" or "as though".

  **ように** connects to verbs and clauses. The verb or clause usually precedes **ように**.

  **ような** connects directly to nouns.
examples:
  - japanese: 彼は亀のように歩く。
    english: He walks like a turtle.
  - japanese: バケツをひっくり返したように雨が降っている。
    english: It's raining as if a bucket was flipped over. (It's pouring rain)
  - japanese: 彼の車は工場のような臭いがする。
    english: His car smells like a factory.
  - japanese: 田中先生は鬼のような怒り方をする。
    english: The way Mr. Tanaka gets angry is like a demon.
  - japanese: 彼は今、人を殺すような目をしている。
    english: Right now, his eyes look as if he is about to kill someone.
  - japanese: 彼女は食べすぎたような顔をしている。
    english: She looks like she ate too much.
  - japanese: あなたが言ったように、事故が起こった。
    english: An accident happened just like you said.
  - japanese: 10代に戻ったように楽しかった。
    english: It was fun, just like being in my teens again.
  - japanese: 君が言うように綺麗ですね。
    english: It is beautiful, just like you say.
  - japanese: 想像できないようなアイデアが沢山ありました。
    english: I had ideas like you couldn't imagine.
  - japanese: まるで時間が止まったかのようだ。
    english: It's as if time has stopped.
  - japanese: 彼女の声は鈴のような音だ。
    english: Her voice is like the sound of a bell.
post_example_writeup: Notice how **ように** follows verbs (歩く, 降っている, 言った) and clauses (１０代に戻った). In contrast,
  **ような** directly modifies nouns (臭い, 怒り方, 目, 顔, アイデア, 音). When expressing a complete hypothetical situation,
  the structure often includes **まるで** (just like, as if), as seen in the example "まるで時間が止まったかのようだ".

post_false_friends_writeup: While several grammar points express similarity, there are subtle differences
  in nuance. **のように** and **のような** tend to express a more direct comparison. **そうに** and **そうな** focus
  on conveying sensory information, what something looks or sounds like. **みたいに** and **みたいな** are more
  casual ways to express similarity, often with a sense of approximation. **ようだ** indicates a judgment
  or inference based on available information. **とおり** signifies exact correspondence, while **ふうに** can
  imply a particular style or manner. **かのようだ** specifically emphasizes the hypothetical nature of the
  comparison. Pay attention to the formality and the specific type of comparison being made to choose
  the most appropriate expression.
