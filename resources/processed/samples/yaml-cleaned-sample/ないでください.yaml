writeup: 「ないでください」 is a polite expression used to ask someone **not** to do something. It combines the
  plain negative form of a verb (ない-form) with 「で」 and 「ください」. 「ください」 is the polite conjunctive form of
  the honorific verb 「くださる」, which is the honorific equivalent of 「くれる」 (to give). While 「ください」 itself
  is a polite form, when attached to the negative 「ないで」 form of a verb, it softens the request, making
  it a polite way to say "please don't." In more casual conversations, 「ください」 can be dropped, and the
  「ないで」 form alone can function as a very casual way of saying "please don't."
