writeup: 'The grammar point **～を～に任せる** is used when you want to express that you are leaving something
  "up to" someone or "entrusting" it to them. The structure is straightforward: **(A) を (B) に任せる**. Here,
  **(A)** is the task or thing being entrusted, and **(B)** is the person or entity to whom it is being
  entrusted. The verb **任せる (まかせる)** itself means "to entrust". Interestingly, this grammar point isn''t
  limited to people; you can also use it to say you''re leaving something up to chance, fate, or even
  a higher power.'
