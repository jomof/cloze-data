writeup: Originating from the verb 責める (semeru), meaning "to blame" or "to press someone to do something",
  せめて (semete) functions as an adverb indicating the minimum acceptable condition or action required to
  achieve a desired outcome. It conveys the idea that while the ideal situation may not be attainable,
  **at least** some minimal effort or result is expected or desired. Think of it as setting a lower bound
  for expectations. せめて often appears at the beginning of a sentence or clause and modifies the entire
  phrase. Because of its origin, it often carries a sense of obligation, responsibility, or a feeling
  that the minimum action should be performed.
