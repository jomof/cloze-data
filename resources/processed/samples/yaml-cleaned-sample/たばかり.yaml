writeup: The grammar point **たばかり** indicates that an action has just been completed. It conveys the feeling
  that not much time has passed since the action occurred. Think of it as highlighting the **recency**
  of an event. It attaches directly to the past tense form of a verb (た-form). While similar to other
  grammar points indicating recent actions, **たばかり** emphasizes the immediacy and freshness of the completed
  action.

false_friends:
  - term: たところだ
    meaning: Just finished doing, Was just doing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both **たばかり** and **たところだ** indicate a recently completed action, **たところだ** can sometimes
      emphasize the process leading up to the completion, whereas **たばかり** focuses purely on the recency.
  - term: たとたんに
    meaning: The instant or moment, As soon as, Just as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **たばかり** which describes an action that has just finished, **たとたんに** emphasizes the
      immediacy of something happening *right after* another action. It focuses on the sequence of events
      rather than the completion of the first action.
  - term: たて
    meaning: Freshly ~ed, Just ~ed
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While **たて** also indicates something recently done, it often carries a nuance of being newly
      made or fresh, particularly with food or recently completed tasks. **たばかり** is more general and
      can apply to a wider range of actions.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing these grammar points, remember that **たばかり** emphasizes
  how little time has passed since an action finished. **たところだ** can have a slightly broader sense of
  recent completion and sometimes includes the preceding process. **たとたんに** focuses on the immediate consequence
  of an action, and **たて** often implies a sense of 'newness' or 'freshness'. Pay attention to the specific
  context to choose the most appropriate expression.
