  **はずがない** expresses a strong sense of improbability or denial. It literally means something is "not bound to be true." It indicates that the speaker believes something is highly unlikely, not the only possibility, or even impossible based on their knowledge or reasoning.

  The nuance is weaker than stating something is definitely not true. Instead, it suggests that the conditions for something to be true are absent. Because **はずがない** (a combination of the noun \u7b48, the case-marking particle \u304c, and the *i*-adjective \u306a\u3044) begins with a noun, it can follow any word that typically modifies a noun.

  Notice the difference in nuance between 「\u5f7cの\u8ecaは\u9ad8くないはずだ。」 and 「\u5f7cの\u8ecaは\u9ad8いはずがない。」. The first, using **はずだ**, suggests a reasoned expectation that the car is not expensive. The second, using **はずがない**, expresses a stronger sense of disbelief or impossibility regarding the car being expensive.

  **はずがない** is not used for expressing personal desires or intentions. It focuses on objective likelihood based on available information or general knowledge.

  While several expressions share a sense of low probability with **はずがない**, it's important to understand their subtle differences.

  **はずだ** indicates a reasonable expectation, the opposite of **はずがない**'s improbability.

  Expressions like **わけだ** indicate a logical conclusion or reason, whereas **はずがない** focuses on the lack of conditions for something to be true.

  **ないことはない** suggests possibility, contrasting with the strong improbability of **はずがない**.

  **ことはない** expresses a lack of necessity, and while sometimes the lack of necessity implies improbability, it's not the core meaning.

  **わけではない** denies a direct connection, and **わけがない** expresses impossibility, which is a stronger sentiment than the typical usage of **はずがない**.

  **ようがない** focuses on the impossibility of an action, whereas **はずがない** relates to the improbability of a state or event.

  Finally, **まさか** is a stronger expression of disbelief, often used rhetorically, and **そうもない** suggests a lower degree of probability based on current observation.
