  **はずがない** expresses a strong sense of improbability or impossibility. It suggests that something is "not bound" to be true, implying that the possibility is very low. While often translated as "hardly possible" or "unlikely," it conveys a slightly weaker nuance, closer to "(A) is not the only possibility."

  Because **はずがない** starts with a noun derived from the kanji 算 (meaning calculation or chance), it can follow any word that typically connects with a noun.

  **Caution:**

  Be mindful of the subtle difference between **ないはずだ** and **はずがない**. **ないはずだ** ("bound not to") strongly negates a statement, indicating the speaker's belief that it's almost certainly false. Conversely, **はずがない** ("not bound to") simply suggests that the possibility of something being 100% true is not the case.

post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in the examples, **はずがない** doesn't express absolute certainty but
  rather a very strong conviction based on available information or general knowledge. For instance, stating
  「夏に雪が降るはずがない」 implies a belief rooted in the common understanding of weather patterns. The nuance is
  that while theoretically possible, it's so improbable as to be dismissed.

post_false_friends_writeup: While several expressions share a similar sense of impossibility or improbability
  with **はずがない**, there are subtle distinctions. **わけがない** is perhaps the closest synonym, also conveying
  a strong sense of impossibility based on reason or logic. However, **はずがない** often carries a slightly
  stronger subjective feeling of conviction. Expressions like **ことはない** and **わけではない** focus on negating
  assumptions or necessity, while **ようがない** emphasizes the lack of means. Understanding these nuances
  will allow for more precise communication. Pay attention to whether the impossibility stems from a logical
  deduction (**わけがない**), a strong personal conviction (**はずがない**), or a lack of necessity (**ことはない**).
