etymology: The grammar point 「ておく」 combines the 「て」-form of a verb with the verb 「置く」 (おく), which means
  "to put" or "to place". The 「て」-form indicates a sequence of actions, and 「置く」 adds the nuance of doing
  something now and leaving it for later.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point **ておく (te oku)** expresses the idea of doing something in advance, often for a specific purpose or future event. Think of it as performing an action now so that you're prepared for something later, or to prevent a future inconvenience.

  The verb **置く (oku)** itself means "to place" or "to put". When attached to the て-form of another verb, it gains this preparatory nuance. You can imagine it as "doing something and leaving it as is until later".

  Here are some common uses of ておく:

  *  **Preparation for a future event:** Doing something now to get ready for what's coming.
  *  **Preventing something undesirable:** Taking action now to avoid a negative outcome later.
  *  **Completing a necessary action:** Doing something that needs to be done at some point, so you might as well do it now.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The contracted forms **とく (toku)** and **どく (doku)** (for verbs ending in 「む」、「ぶ」、「ぬ」) are common in informal speech, especially in media like dramas and manga. For example, 「読んどく」 instead of 「読んでおく」.
  *  The nuance implies a degree of intentionality in preparing for the future.

false_friends:
  - term: てある
    meaning: Something is done, Has been done, Remaining state
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ておく」, which focuses on the action done in advance by someone, 「てある」 describes the
      resulting state of something being done, often without a specific actor. 「窓が開けてある」 (The window has
      been opened) emphasizes the open state of the window, while 「窓を開けておく」 (I'll open the window beforehand)
      emphasizes the act of opening it.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「ておく」 and 「てある」 relate to actions being done, the key difference
  lies in focus. 「ておく」 emphasizes the *action* of preparing for the future, whereas 「てある」 emphasizes the
  *state* that results from an action. Think of 「ておく」 as "doing something now for later" and 「てある」 as
  "something has been done and is in that state now."
