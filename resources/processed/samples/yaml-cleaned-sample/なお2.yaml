meaning: In addition, Incidentally, Furthermore, Moreover
details:
  Register: Formal
  使用域: 硬い
writeup: When used at the beginning of a sentence, the adverb 尚 (usually written as なお) will often carry
  the meaning of "in addition", "furthermore", "even more", or "moreover". This usage is frequently seen
  when the preceding sentence or clause has presented a foundational fact or situation, and the second
  sentence builds upon it. It's particularly common when the information in the second part of the sentence
  is somewhat unexpected or noteworthy. As なお is a formal structure, it is typically found in written
  materials like letters, posters, and formal announcements. Interestingly, in all its uses, なお suggests
  that taking the preceding information (A) into consideration, the statement (B) is true, even though
  it might not be immediately apparent or expected. This can be used in both positive and negative contexts,
  emphasizing the surprising nature of (B).

      else.

    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「それに」 is a more versatile conjunction that can connect ideas more loosely than the formal

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing なお② with similar expressions, remember that なお② is particularly
  used in formal contexts to add a related but sometimes unexpected piece of information after a base
  statement. While しかも emphasizes the added information, その上 is slightly less formal, and それに is a more
  general connector. The nuance of なお② lies in its formal tone and the way it highlights the additional
  point as something noteworthy given the preceding context.
