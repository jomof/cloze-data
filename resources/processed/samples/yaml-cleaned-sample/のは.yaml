writeup: The grammar point 「のは」 acts as a **nominalizer**, turning a verb or clause into a noun phrase.
  It essentially means "the one who..." or "that which..." in English. Think of it like pointing out a
  specific action or state and making it the subject of the sentence. You can attach 「のは」 directly to
  the plain form of a verb (dictionary form, past tense, negative, etc.). However, you cannot attach it
  directly to polite forms ending in 「ます」 or 「ません」. Be careful not to confuse 「のは」 with 「こと」, which also
  nominalizes verbs but has different usage contexts, especially in set phrases. Also, 「のは」 cannot be
  directly followed by 「だ」、「である」, or 「です」. In those cases, you would use 「のです」 or 「んです」.
examples:
  - japanese: 私がお弁当を作った**の**は昨日です。
    english: The time I made the lunchbox was yesterday.
    register: standard
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「のは」nominalizes the clause 「私がお弁当を作った」, making it the subject of the sentence.
  - japanese: 彼女が好きな**の**は甘いものです。
    english: What she likes are sweet things.
    register: standard
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「のは」 highlights 「彼女が好きな」 and turns it into the subject. The use of 「もの」 adds a sense of generality
      to "sweet things".
  - japanese: 君と初めて会った**の**は、このカフェだったね。
    english: The place we first met was this cafe, wasn't it?
    register: casual
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The 「ね」 at the end adds a touch of seeking confirmation and shared memory, fitting a first-date
      setting. 「のは」 emphasizes the act of meeting for the first time.
  - japanese: 僕が一番大切にしている**の**は、君だよ。
    english: What I treasure most is you.
    register: intimate
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「のは」 focuses on 「僕が一番大切にしている」, making it the core of the romantic confession. 「だよ」 is a masculine
      casual sentence ending, expressing directness and intimacy.
  - japanese: 山田さんが発表する**の**は、明日の午後です。
    english: When Mr. Yamada will present is tomorrow afternoon.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: Using 「さん」 makes it formal. 「のは」 clarifies the timing of the presentation.
false_friends:
  - term: の (possession)
    meaning: Indicates possession
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「のは」 which nominalizes verbs/clauses, the possessive 「の」 connects nouns, indicating
      ownership or association (e.g., 「私の本」 - my book).
  - term: は
    meaning: As for... (Highlights sentence topic)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「は」 marks the topic of the sentence, 「のは」 specifically turns a verb or clause into a
      noun phrase that can act as the topic or subject.
  - term: こと
    meaning: Converting a verb into a noun
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both nominalize verbs, 「こと」 is often used for more abstract concepts or when stating
      facts, and it appears in set expressions like 「ことができる」. 「のは」 often emphasizes the action or the
      person performing the action.
  - term: Adjective + の(は)
    meaning: The 'one' that... (Indefinite pronoun, Adjective nominalization)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: When used with an adjective, 「の」 acts as a pronoun meaning 'the one' (e.g., 「赤いのはどれですか?」 -
      Which is the red one?). 「のは」 focuses on a verbal action or state.
  - term: Particle + の
    meaning: Combined particles
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Sometimes 「の」 follows other particles, creating different meanings (e.g., 「のため」 - because
      of). 「のは」 specifically nominalizes verbs or clauses.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「のは」 always follows a verb in its plain
  form (or a clause ending in a plain-form verb) and turns that whole action into a noun-like subject.
  The other uses of 「の」 have different functions within a sentence. Pay attention to what comes before
  「の」 to understand its role.
