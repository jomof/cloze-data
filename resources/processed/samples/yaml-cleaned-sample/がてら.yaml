  がてら is a modern Japanese particle, functioning similarly to an adverbial particle. It connects to the conjunctive form of verbs and to nouns. It shares a similar meaning with ながら, often translating to "while (A), (B)," "during (A), (B)," or "on the occasion of (A)." When used with a noun (A), it typically refers to a noun signifying physical movement.

  Unlike ながら, がてら emphasizes that (A) presents a convenient opportunity to accomplish (B). The nuance suggests taking advantage of doing something while already doing something else.

  **Fun Fact:** がてら is derived from a vocal change of がてり, which originates from an abbreviation of the conjunctive form of 糅つ (katsu), meaning "to mix together," and あり (ari). So, かてあり (kateari) was shortened to かてり (kateri), and subsequently underwent sound changes to がてり (gateri) and がてら (gatera). The original sense of "being mixed together" subtly persists in the modern nuance, implying that the two actions are combined.

    meaning: While you are at it, On the occasion
    kind: synonym

      of activities.

    kind: synonym

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that がてら suggests the first action enables or
  provides an opportunity for the second. ついでに is more about convenience, and ながら simply means 'while
  doing'. Consider the intention behind combining the actions when choosing between these expressions.
