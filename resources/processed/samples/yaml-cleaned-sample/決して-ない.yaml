  **決して (kesshite)** by itself is the te-form of the verb **決する (kessuru)**, meaning "to decide". However, **決して** functions primarily as an adverb. As an adverb, it carries the meaning of "decidedly" or "assuredly" and is **always used with a negative verb form** (ない) to convey the meaning of "never", "under no circumstances", or "by no means".

  Like many adverbs in Japanese, **決して** can appear at the beginning of a sentence or directly before the word it modifies (the negative verb). While the English translation is often "never", the literal sense of **決して** is closer to "decidedly not" or "assuredly not", emphasizing the negative aspect of the sentence.

  **Important Consideration:**

  *  Be aware that **決して** can also be paired with structures that are not explicitly negative, most notably **ものか**. **ものか** strongly confirms a statement as being something that does not exist or will not be done. This usage reinforces a strong sense of negation or denial.

    setting: serious
    listener_gender: female

      a younger female with this level of politeness is standard in a potentially dangerous situation.

    conjugation: negative (plain)

    conjugation: dictionary form

    setting: humorous
    speaker_gender: male

      context.

      he's lazy. 「～なだけだ」 provides a simple explanation.

    english: No matter how many times my friends pressure me to go, I will never go.
    conjugation: negative (plain)

      casual refusal.

    english: I will never forgive you if you lie to me.
    conjugation: negative (plain)
    register: casual
    setting: serious

    listener_gender: male

      could say this, a female speaker might use a slightly softer tone overall, though the severity of
      the statement remains.

  - term: ことはない
    meaning: There is no need to, Never happens
    kind: synonym

      a firm "never". For example, 「行くことはない」 means "there's no need to go", not "I will never go".

    meaning: Not even a little, Not at all, Not in the least, Never

      of knowledge.
  - term: 全く～ない
    meaning: Not~at all
    kind: synonym

      "I can't understand at all", emphasizing the totality of the lack of understanding.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **決して** specifically emphasizes the decisiveness
  of the negation. **ことはない** focuses on necessity or frequency, while **少しも** and **全く** highlight the
  extent or completeness of the negation. Pay attention to the nuance each word brings to the sentence.
