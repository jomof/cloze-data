  **決して (kesshite)** functions as an adverb meaning "definitely," "absolutely," or "by no means." It is **always used with a negative verb form** (〜ない) to express a strong negation, similar to "never" or "under no circumstances." Think of 決して as emphasizing the negative. While it often translates to "never," its literal sense is closer to "decidedly not."

  Like many Japanese adverbs, 決して can appear at the **beginning of a sentence** for emphasis or **directly before the negative verb** it modifies.

  **Important Consideration:** While primarily used with negative verb forms, 決して can occasionally be paired with structures that express a strong denial or improbability, such as **ものか**. This intensifies the feeling of impossibility or strong rejection.

  - term: ことはない
    meaning: There is no need to, Never happens
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 決して〜ない, ことはない indicates a lack of necessity or that something doesn't usually happen.
      It doesn't carry the same strong emphasis on absolute negation.
  - term: すこしも～ない
    meaning: Not even a little, Not at all, Not in the least, Never
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While すこしも〜ない also means "not at all," it focuses on the lack of even a small amount or degree.
      決して〜ない implies a stronger, more absolute negation.
  - term: 全く～ない
    meaning: Not~at all
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 全く〜ない is similar in meaning to 決して〜ない, both expressing a complete lack of something. However,
      決して often carries a stronger sense of determination or finality, while 全く is a more general way
      to say "not at all."
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 決して emphasizes the absolute negativity of
  a statement. ことはない focuses on the absence of need or typical occurrence. すこしも～ない highlights the lack
  of even a small amount, and 全く is a general way to express "not at all" without the same level of emphasis
  as 決して.
