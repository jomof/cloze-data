writeup: |-
  ずに済む is a grammar construction used in Japanese to indicate that one can "get away without doing (A)", or "it's no problem without (A)". This structure combines ず, a literary auxiliary verb that attaches to verbs similarly to ない (and carries the same negative meaning), with に, and 済む, a う-verb meaning "to come to pass" or "to end up". Literally, it can be thought of as meaning "it will work out without (A)". As mentioned, ず connects to verbs in the same way as ない, so this structure will appear after the verbs being negated. Because the core meaning is derived from 済む, other similar constructions such as ないですむ or なしですむ may also be used. 無しで functions as a suffix, allowing it to follow nouns directly, unlike ないで and ずに.

  In most cases, (A) will be something considered unpleasant or bothersome, highlighting the speaker's relief at avoiding it.

  - term: ずに
    meaning: Without doing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ずに済む, ずに simply indicates the absence of an action without necessarily implying a fortunate
      outcome or relief. It focuses on the lack of the action itself.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that ずに focuses on the action *not* being done,
  while ずに済む emphasizes the positive outcome of *not* having to do something that was potentially expected
  or undesirable. For instance, saying 「朝ご飯を食べずに会社に行った」 (I went to work without eating breakfast) simply
  states a fact. Saying 「朝ご飯を食べずに済んだ」 would imply that there was a reason the speaker was glad they didn't
  have to eat breakfast, perhaps they were in a rush or weren't hungry.
