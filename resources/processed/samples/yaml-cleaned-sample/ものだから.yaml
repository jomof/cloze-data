writeup: 「ものだから」 is a strong phrase used when explaining something or giving an excuse for one's reasoning.
  Think of it as an extension of 「から」 "because," where the noun 「もの」 "thing" emphasizes the preceding
  statement. Common English translations include "because (A)" and "the reason is (A)." 「ものだから」 directly
  follows verbs and い-adjectives in their plain form. For な-adjectives and nouns, it's 「〜なものだから」. Occasionally,
  「ものだから」 is abbreviated to 「もので」 or 「もんで」 without changing the meaning. The 「だ」 changing to its conjunctive
  form 「で」 suggests something follows, though this can be omitted if it's obvious. **Important Note:**
  「ものだから」 is often used to explain one's actions, emphasizing that situation (A) specifically led to the
  speaker doing (B).
