details:
  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
writeup: 「って」 is a slang form of the topic marker 「は」. It's primarily used in **spoken language** to indicate
  the topic of a sentence in a casual manner. Think of it as a more relaxed and informal way of saying
  「は」. You can directly attach it to a noun or pronoun that you want to highlight as the topic of the
  discussion.
examples:
  - japanese: 私って、もしかして皆に嫌われているの?
    english: Speaking of me, am I perhaps disliked by everyone?
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The use of 「って」 instead of 「は」 makes the question sound more informal and conversational.
      The 「の」 at the end indicates a question, and 「もしかして」 adds a touch of uncertainty.
  - japanese: ねえ、トマトって野菜なの?それともフルーツなの?
    english: Hey, as for tomatoes, are they vegetables? Or are they fruits?
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「ねえ」 at the beginning makes it a friendly and casual inquiry. 「って」 marks 「トマト」 as the topic
      being questioned. 「それとも」 is used to present an alternative.
  - japanese: このパスタって、すごく美味しいよね。
    english: Speaking of this pasta, it's really delicious, isn't it?
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「って」 casually introduces 「このパスタ」 as the topic of shared enjoyment. 「よね」 is a common tag question
      seeking agreement.
  - japanese: すみません、あの人ってどなたですか?
    english: Excuse me, as for that person, who are they?
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Even in a slightly more polite context using 「すみません」 and 「どなた」, 「って」 can still be used for
      the topic marker, though 「は」 would be more standard. It retains a slightly softer feel.
  - japanese: 先生って、いつもお洒落で優しいね。
    english: Speaking of the teacher, she's always fashionable and kind, isn't she?
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「先生って」 makes the comment about the teacher feel like a casual observation among peers or students.
      「ね」 at the end seeks confirmation or agreement.
  - japanese: 日本語の勉強って、本当に難しいなあ。
    english: As for studying Japanese, it's really difficult, huh?
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「って」 marks 「日本語の勉強」 as the topic of the speaker's lament. 「なあ」 at the end expresses a feeling
      of difficulty or frustration.
  - japanese: 冬って、確かに寒いけど、雪景色は本当に綺麗だよね。
    english: Speaking of winter, it's certainly cold, but the snowy scenery is really beautiful, isn't
      it?
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「冬って」 establishes winter as the topic. 「確かに」 acknowledges the coldness, while 「けど」 introduces
      a contrasting thought about the beauty of the snow. 「よね」 seeks agreement.
  - japanese: 君って、目が綺麗だね。見つめられるとドキドキしちゃうよ。
    english: Speaking of you, your eyes are beautiful. When I'm stared at, my heart races.
    register: flirty
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「君って」 directly addresses the listener and brings them up as the topic of the compliment. 「目が綺麗だね」
      is a direct compliment, and 「ドキドキしちゃうよ」 expresses the speaker's feelings in a charming way. The
      casual 「～ちゃう」 adds to the informal and slightly vulnerable tone.
  - japanese: あのさ、今度の日曜日って、もしよかったら映画でも見に行かない?
    english: Hey, speaking of next Sunday, if you're free, how about we go see a movie or something?
    register: casual
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「あのさ」 starts the sentence casually. 「今度の日曜日って」 introduces the topic of the upcoming Sunday
      when suggesting the outing. 「もしよかったら」 is a common polite phrase for making a suggestion, and 「映画でも見に行かない?」
      is an inviting question.
post_example_writeup: While 「って」 is generally interchangeable with 「は」 in casual speech, it can sometimes
  carry a slightly different nuance. It can feel more direct or emphatic than 「は」 in some contexts, though
  this is subtle. It's best to get a feel for its usage through listening to natural Japanese conversations.

  - term: なんか・なんて
    meaning: Such as, Things like, Emphasis
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「って」 which primarily marks the topic, 「なんか」 and 「なんて」 are used to give examples or
      add emphasis, and often carry a sense of downplaying or being casual about something. For example,
      「なんか疲れた」 (I'm kind of tired) uses 「なんか」 to express a vague feeling, while 「宿題なんて簡単だよ」 (Homework
      is easy, and things like that) uses 「なんて」 for emphasis and providing an example.
  - term: は
    meaning: As for... (Highlights sentence topic)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「って」 is a casual version of 「は」, 「は」 is the standard topic marker and is appropriate
      in a wider range of registers, including formal situations. 「は」 generally sounds more neutral and
      less colloquial than 「って」.
  - term: といえば
    meaning: Speaking of, If it were the case that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「って」 which simply marks the topic, 「といえば」 explicitly indicates that the current statement
      is being made because the preceding topic was mentioned, or it can introduce a hypothetical situation.
      For example, 「日本の夏といえば、祭りだね」 (Speaking of Japanese summer, it's festivals, isn't it?) shows a direct
      connection to the previously mentioned topic of Japanese summer.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「って」 with similar expressions, remember that 「って」 is the
  most casual and is primarily a topic marker. 「は」 is the standard version for broader use. 「なんか」 and
  「なんて」 often introduce examples or emphasis, while 「といえば」 signals a connection to a previous topic or
  a hypothetical situation.
