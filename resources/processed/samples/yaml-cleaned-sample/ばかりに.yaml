writeup: The grammar point **ばかりに** expresses the idea of "simply because" or "just because" something
  happened, it led to a particular result. It literally implies that "even with just (A), (B) was able
  to occur." This pattern frequently appears with verbs in the past tense, highlighting that a completed
  action resulted in something else. To use **ばかりに**, attach it to the end of a word in its attributive
  form (the form used before nouns). While **ばかりに** often accompanies negative outcomes, it can also express
  strong desire or enthusiasm when used with expressions like **たい** (want to) or **ほしい** (want).
