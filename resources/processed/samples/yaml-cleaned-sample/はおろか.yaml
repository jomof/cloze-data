writeup: は疎か is an expression similar to はもちろん, meaning "of course A, but B". While 疎か itself as a な-adjective
  means "negligent" or "alienation", it's rarely used in isolation in modern Japanese. Instead, it primarily
  appears in set expressions like はおろか. Despite the infrequent independent usage of 疎か, the nuance of
  "alienation" or "completely removed from" is present in はおろか. It essentially means "completely putting
  aside (A), (B)". Common English translations include "let alone (A), (B)" and "it's needless to say
  that (A), when (B)". Typically, (A) and (B) belong to the same category, with (B) being the more obvious
  or expected of the two. Due to this obviousness, (B) is frequently followed by the adverbial particle
  さえ, emphasizing (B) as the minimum extent. Other adverbial particles like も, すら, or まで can also be used
  in place of さえ. Generally, sentences using はおろか tend to carry a negative connotation.
