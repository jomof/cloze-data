writeup: To create the past tense of い-Adjectives, you remove the final い and add **かった**. This is the
  plain past form, equivalent to "was" or "were" in English. For the polite past form, you add **です**
  to the plain past form, making it **かったです**. The negative past plain form is created by changing the
  い to く and adding **なかった**, and the polite negative past form is **くなかったです**.
