writeup: '**たとたんに** (written as **た途端に** in kanji) expresses that something happens immediately after
  something else. Think of it as "**the instant**" or "**the moment**" something occurs. It''s formed
  by combining the past tense auxiliary verb **た** with the noun **途端** (totan), meaning "the moment,"
  and the particle **に** (ni), indicating adverbial usage. The structure **(A)た途端に(B)** indicates that
  **(B)** happens immediately following **(A)**. Importantly, **(B)** often describes an event that is
  unexpected, surprising, or beyond the speaker''s control. The literal meaning of **途端** being "on the
  tip of" emphasizes the immediacy and near simultaneity of the two events.'

      of events following 「たとたんに」.
post_false_friends_writeup: While several expressions share the nuance of something happening shortly
  after something else, it's important to distinguish their specific connotations. 「なり」 can suggest a
  more deliberate sequence, 「と同時に」 emphasizes simultaneity, and 「かと思ったら・かと思うと」 highlights surprise or
  contrast. 「たところだ」 and 「たばかり」 focus on the completion or recency of an action, whereas 「たとたんに」 emphasizes
  the immediate consequence. 「直ちに」 is a straightforward adverb of time, and 「次第」 often implies a planned
  sequence. To avoid confusion, consider whether you want to emphasize the immediacy of the consequence
  (たとたんに), the simultaneity (と同時に), the recency of the first action (たばかり), or a planned sequence (次第).
