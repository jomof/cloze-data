  **ていては** expresses the idea that "if a certain state or action continues, a particular (often negative) consequence will follow."

  It is formed by combining the **て-form** of a verb, the **て-form** of いる (to be), and the particle **は**. The **ては** construction itself often indicates a hypothetical situation or a repeated action. In this grammar point, it blends both aspects depending on the verb it's attached to.

  Think of it as setting up a conditional scenario where the continuation of X leads to Y. Y is usually something undesirable.

  Interestingly, the **ては** in **ていては** is the same **ては** found in other negative consequence patterns like "てはいけない" (must not), "てはならない" (must not), and "てはだめ" (must not). This shared element highlights the negative implication often associated with **ていては**.

post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, **ていては** often emphasizes the continuous nature of the
  action or state leading to the negative outcome. The consequence isn't necessarily immediate but is
  presented as a likely result of the ongoing situation. Notice how the English translations often use
  phrases like "keep doing" to capture this sense of continuation.

  - term: ては
    meaning: If, With, Since, Because
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Expresses a conditional or consequential relationship, but doesn't necessarily emphasize the
      continuous nature of the action or state like ていては.
post_false_friends_writeup: While **ては** and **ていては** both express conditionality, **ていては** specifically
  highlights the ongoing nature of the action or state in the 'if' clause. Think of **ては** as a more general
  "if this happens" whereas **ていては** is more like "if this *continues* to happen". The presence of いる
  (to be) in its **て-form** within **ていては** is the key differentiator, adding that sense of continuity.
