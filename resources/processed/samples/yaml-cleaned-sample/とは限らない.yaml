writeup: '**とは限らない (to wa kagiranai)** is used to express that something is not necessarily true or that
  there is no guarantee of a particular outcome. It conveys a sense of uncertainty or possibility of exceptions.
  The structure is fairly rigid: [clause] + とは限らない. The preceding clause can be a verb in its dictionary
  form, an い-adjective, a な-adjective followed by だ, or a noun followed by だ. The core meaning comes from
  限る (kagiru), which means "to limit." The negative form 限らない implies the opposite: "not limited" or "not
  confined to one possibility."'
