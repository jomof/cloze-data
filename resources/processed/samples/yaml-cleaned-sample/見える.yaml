writeup: |-
  Similar to how 聞こえる describes things that are "audible," 見える describes things that are "visible." 見える is an **intransitive verb**, so the object that is visible is marked with が. When using 見える in this way, the visible thing (A) is followed by が (Aが見える). How something appears can be described adverbially. For an い-adjective, change it to its く form. For な-adjectives or nouns, follow them with に. This usage of 見える, meaning "to seem," will be covered in more detail in a separate lesson.

  **Important Considerations:**

  The main difference between 見える and 見られる (the potential form of 見る) is that 見える is used for things that don't require active concentration to see. If you're looking in the right direction, seeing it is unavoidable. On the other hand, 見られる is used when the observer is actively trying to focus on something, referring to their ability to see it.

  Also, 見える can sometimes describe the sense of sight itself, referring to whether anything is visible to the speaker.
