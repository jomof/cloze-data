writeup: |-
  **ものを** expresses a sense of disappointment or regret that a desired outcome (A) did not happen, and instead an undesirable result (B) occurred. It conveys the feeling that (A) should have happened under normal circumstances.

  It functions similarly to **のに** in expressing a contrast between expectation and reality, but with a stronger emphasis on the speaker's dissatisfaction. Think of it as "(A) is what should have happened, but (B) is what actually happened, and I'm not happy about it."

  **ものを** typically follows verbs and い-adjectives in their dictionary form, or な-adjectives followed by な. It is often, but not always, preceded by hypothetical constructions using **ば** or **たら**.

  It's common to see **ものを** at the end of a sentence, with the latter part left unsaid. In these cases, the intended meaning is clear from the first part of the sentence, which describes the desired but unrealized situation. The speaker's frustration is implied.

  The particle **を** here indicates an ideal or goal that was not achieved, with the action to achieve it being omitted. **ものを** can be interpreted as "regarding that which was (A)," with the frustrated sentiment left unexpressed.

  **ものを** often implies a sense of blame, either towards oneself or someone else, for the undesirable outcome. The speaker feels that the situation could have been avoided if the desired action (A) had been taken.

  Consider the nuance difference between using **のに** and **ものを**. While both express a contrast, **ものを** carries a stronger emotional weight, emphasizing regret or frustration. **のに** is more neutral in comparison, simply stating a contradiction between expectation and reality.
