writeup: ものを expresses the speaker's feeling of regret, disappointment, or dissatisfaction that a desired
  outcome didn't happen. It conveys a sense that the desired outcome **should have happened** under different
  circumstances. It's similar to のに but often carries a stronger nuance of wishing things were different.
  You can think of it as saying, "If only (A) had been the case, then (B) wouldn't have happened." or
  "(A) should have happened, but instead (B) happened." ものを typically follows a verb or い-adjective in
  its plain form or a な-adjective followed by な. It's frequently seen at the end of a sentence, with the
  undesirable consequence left unsaid but implied from the context.
etymology: ものを is formed from the noun 物 (mono), meaning "thing," and the adverbial particle を (o). The
  particle を here indicates an object or goal, but in this construction, the specific action is omitted.
  Essentially, ものを can be understood as referring to "that thing which would have been…" implying the
  desired or expected situation.
