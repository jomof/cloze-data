  **確かに (tashika ni)** is used as an adverb and translates to "surely" or "certainly" in English. It emphasizes the speaker's agreement or acknowledgment of a fact. It's derived from the な-adjective **確か (tashika)**, meaning "certain" or "sure." Think of **確かに** as a way to say, "Yes, without a doubt."

  Important Considerations:

  *  While **確かに** can mean "certainly," be cautious when translating it directly to mean granting permission. In English, "certainly" can be used to give permission (e.g., "Can I go?" "Certainly."). **確かに** doesn't carry this nuance.
  *  Without the **に**, **確か (tashika)** often takes on a slightly different meaning, closer to "if I remember correctly" or "if I'm not mistaken." It indicates a degree of uncertainty or recalling information.

    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Using the intimate 「ねえ」, the speaker seeks agreement, then uses 「確かに」 to emphasize the excellent

post_example_writeup: Remember that while 「確かに」 expresses certainty, it doesn't function as a way to grant
  permission like "certainly" can in English. In the example sentence that translates to "Certainly! You
  may play video games if you finish your homework," 「確かに！」 sounds unnatural in Japanese as a standalone
  permission. A more natural way to express permission would be using phrases like 「いいよ」 or 「もちろん」.
