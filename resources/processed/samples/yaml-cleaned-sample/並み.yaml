  並み is the noun form of the classical verb 並む, which has the same meaning as 並ぶ, ‘to line up', or ‘to be in line'. It is used following nouns and can be interpreted as being “on par with (A)”, “worthy of (A)”, or “as standard for (A)”. The literal sense of “in line with (A)” also fits well in many contexts.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Although 並み can sometimes mean “as standard for (A)” when used as a suffix, the sense of “average” or “ordinary” usually applies when 並み is a standalone noun. In these cases, it's typically written as 並 and followed by the case-marking particle の, and then another noun specifying what the average is.
  *  並み is only used when (A) has a well-recognized or easily identifiable standard or norm. It sounds unnatural when the “norm” is subjective or based on personal opinion rather than an objective standard.
