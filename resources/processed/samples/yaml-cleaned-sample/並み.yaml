writeup: |-
  **並み** is the noun form of the classical verb 並む, which has the same meaning as 並ぶ, ‘to line up', or ‘to be in line'. It is used following nouns and can be interpreted as ‘on par with (A)', ‘worthy of (A)', or ‘as standard for (A)'. The literal translation of ‘in line with (A)' also works well in many cases.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While **並み** may occasionally mean ‘as standard for (A)' as a suffix, the ‘average' or ‘ordinary' meaning is often reserved for when **並み** is used by itself as a noun. In these cases, it is usually written as 並 and followed by the case-marking particle の, and then a second noun indicating what the average is.
  *  **並み** can only be used in sentences where (A) has a standard or norm that is well recognized or easily identifiable. Using it when the ‘norm' is subjective will sound unnatural.
