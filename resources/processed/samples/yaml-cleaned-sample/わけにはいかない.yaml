  わけにはいかない is a grammatical structure used to express that something is **impossible** or that one **cannot afford** to do something due to moral obligation, social pressure, or circumstances. It combines わけ (wake), meaning 'reason' or 'circumstance,' the particle に, the topic marker は, and the negative form of the verb 行く (iku), meaning 'to go'. Literally, it translates closer to "it cannot be that [something happens/you do something]".

  It's typically used immediately after the **dictionary form of a verb**, emphasizing the action that is impossible or cannot be done. The nuance often implies a sense of **obligation** or that there are **strong reasons** preventing the action.

  While primarily used for undesirable actions that cannot be avoided, it can also describe a desirable action that is impossible to achieve due to external factors. The interpretation often depends on context and tone.

  hand, describes an irresistible urge.
