  「わけにはいかない」 combines 「わけ」 meaning "reason" or "cause", the case marking particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negative form of the verb 行く (iku), 「いかない」, meaning "cannot go". The literal sense is closer to "it cannot be so that (A)", implying that a certain action is either impossible due to circumstances or that the speaker feels strongly obligated against doing it. It's used directly after the dictionary form of a verb.

  While primarily expressing something undesirable or against one's principles, it can also indicate something desirable but unattainable. The nuance often conveys a sense of obligation, duty, or being in a situation where there's no choice. Sometimes, it carries a sense of resignation, similar to "I guess it's just not meant to be so" in English.
