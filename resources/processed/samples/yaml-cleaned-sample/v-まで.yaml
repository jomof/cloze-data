writeup: The particle **まで (made)** indicates a time limit or endpoint for an action or state. It translates
  to "until" when used with verbs, signifying that a certain state or action continues up to the point
  when the verb's action occurs. It's crucial to remember that the verb preceding まで is typically in the
  **non-past form** (dictionary form). The tense of the sentence is usually conveyed by other verbs within
  the sentence or by the overall context. While in English we might naturally use the past tense after
  "until", in Japanese, the focus is on the endpoint, which is yet to be reached when the initial action
  or state begins.

    meaning: Until, Till, To (but no further than)
    kind: synonym

      limit. For example, 「明日まで」 (until tomorrow) or 「駅まで」(to the station).
  - term: までに
    meaning: By ~, By the time that ~, Before ~

      The action must be completed by that point. For example, 「明日までに宿題を出してください」 (Please submit the homework
      by tomorrow).

    meaning: Even, To even, To the extent of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike "Verb + まで", when used to mean "even", the particle まで indicates an extreme case or

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that "Verb + まで" focuses on the duration of an
  action or state up to a certain point. 「までに」 sets a deadline, and when まで means "even", it highlights
  an extreme case. Pay attention to the context to differentiate between these usages.
