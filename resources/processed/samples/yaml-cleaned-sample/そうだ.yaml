writeup: |-
  The auxiliary verb **そうだ** has two primary functions in Japanese. It can convey one of the following things:

  **Hearsay: 伝聞** - Highlighting things that have been heard from other people.
  **Appearance: 様態** - Highlighting the way that things "appear", or "seem".

  The appearance nuance is covered in another lesson, so we will focus on **hearsay** in this grammar point. When used to repeat statements that have been heard from other people/sources, **そうだ** (or **そうです**) will be paired with the plain form of a verb or い-Adjective, or a noun/な-Adjective followed by **だ**. **そうだ** always implies that the speaker is not 100% certain about the validity of the information that they are conveying. Due to this, it does not sound as confident as other expressions, like **ようだ**.

  **Caution**
  In order to avoid confusion between the **そうだ** that is used for repeating information, and the **そうだ** that is used for making observations, the following differences will need to be memorized:

  **Verbs**
  - 降るそうだ - Unaltered verb, **そうだ** that is repeating information.
  - 降りそうだ - conjunctive form, **そうだ** that is used for making observations.

  **い-Adjectives**
  - 寒いそうだ - Unaltered adjective, **そうだ** that is repeating information.
  - 寒そうだ - い removed, **そうだ** that is used for making observations.

  **Nouns and な-Adjectives**
  - 綺麗だそうだ - **だ** is used before **そうだ**. This is repeating information.
  - 綺麗そうだ - No **だ** between the な-Adjective and **そうだ**. This is making an observation.
