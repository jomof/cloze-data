  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
etymology: もっとも originally comes from the noun 尤も (mottomo), meaning 'reason,' 'right,' or 'plausibility.'
  As a conjunction, it retains a nuance of acknowledging one point but introducing a qualification or
  contrasting element that is also reasonable or important.
writeup: もっとも is a conjunction used to introduce a qualification or contrasting point to a previous statement.
  While often translated as "although," it can also convey nuances of "for all that" or "with that said,"
  depending on the context. It indicates that while the initial statement (A) is true, it's not the complete
  picture and requires further clarification. The subsequent statement (B) often ends with が, けど, けれども,
  or similar expressions indicating contrast. Think of it as saying "(A) is true, *however*, (B) is also
  important to consider." As a noun, 尤も means 'to stand to reason,' and this nuance remains when used
  as a conjunction.
