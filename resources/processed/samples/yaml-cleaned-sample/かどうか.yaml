writeup: かどうか is a grammatical structure used to express **uncertainty or a question about two possibilities**.
  It translates to "whether or not" in English. You can attach かどうか directly to the end of a clause to
  indicate that you are considering if that clause is true or not. Think of it as combining a statement
  with a question. For example, instead of saying "Is it A?" separately, you incorporate the uncertainty
  directly into a larger sentence.

false_friends:
  - term: か何か
    meaning: Or something, Or something like that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike かどうか, か何か implies a non-specific alternative, not a definite 'yes' or 'no' choice.
      For example, 「コーヒーか何か飲みませんか」 means 'Would you like to drink coffee or something?'
  - term: Question-phrase + か
    meaning: Including questions within sentences
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both can embed questions, Question-phrase + か directly asks a 'wh-' question within
      a sentence. For example, 「どこに行くか教えてください」 means 'Please tell me where you are going.', focusing on
      the 'where'.
  - term: 〜でも 〜でも
    meaning: Whether ~ or, Neither ~ or
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 〜でも 〜でも presents two explicit options, while かどうか focuses on the uncertainty of a single situation.
      For instance, 「雨でも雪でも行きます」 means 'I will go whether it rains or snows'.
  - term: ～ても～なくても
    meaning: Whether ~ or not
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ～ても～なくても specifically highlights the presence or absence of an action or state, whereas かどうか
      is more general. 「行っても行かなくても連絡します」 means 'I will contact you whether I go or not'.
  - term: にしても～にしても
    meaning: Regardless of whether
    kind: synonym
    nuance: にしても～にしても emphasizes that the outcome is the same despite different conditions. For example,
      「賛成にしても反対にしても、意見を言ってください」 means 'Regardless of whether you agree or disagree, please state your
      opinion'.
  - term: にしても
    meaning: Even though, Even if, Even when, Also
    kind: synonym
    nuance: にしても has multiple meanings, often expressing concession or addition, unlike the binary uncertainty
      of かどうか. 「高いにしても、買います」 means 'Even though it's expensive, I will buy it'.
  - term: にしろ～にしろ
    meaning: Whether… or
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 〜でも 〜でも, にしろ～にしろ presents two explicit options, while かどうか expresses uncertainty
      about one. 「好きにしろ嫌いにしろ、やらなければなりません」 means 'Whether you like it or dislike it, you have to do it'.
  - term: か否か
    meaning: Whether or not
    kind: synonym
    nuance: か否か is a more formal and literary equivalent of かどうか. While the meaning is the same, かどうか
      is more common in everyday conversation.
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share a sense of alternatives or uncertainty, remember
  that かどうか specifically focuses on whether a single situation is true or not. The other expressions often
  involve explicitly stated alternatives or slightly different nuances of uncertainty or conditionality.
  Choosing the right one depends on the specific nuance you want to convey.
