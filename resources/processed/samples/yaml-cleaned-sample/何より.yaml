writeup: '**何より** (naniyori), sometimes emphasized as **何よりも** (naniyori mo), is a common Japanese expression
  used to convey feelings of gladness or relief, or to emphasize that something is the most important
  or best thing. It literally translates to "more than anything." This phrase is used to express positive
  emotions, particularly when a situation could have been worse, but a specific positive outcome or aspect
  is paramount. **何より** and **何よりも** primarily function as adverbs, often appearing at the beginning of
  a sentence or immediately before the word they modify. They can also precede a noun when followed by
  the particle **の**. The addition of **も** generally intensifies the phrase without altering its fundamental
  meaning.'
