  **そんな (sonna)**, **こんな (konna)**, **あんな (anna)**, and **どんな (donna)** are commonly used to indicate "such a," "this kind of," "that kind of," and "what kind of," respectively. They act as pre-noun adjectivals (連体詞 - *rentaishi*).

  Think of them like pointing:

  *  **こんな (konna)** refers to something close to the speaker, like 「これ」 (this). Imagine the speaker gesturing towards something nearby.
  *  **そんな (sonna)** refers to something close to the listener, like 「それ」 (that). Imagine the speaker gesturing towards something near the person they are talking to.
  *  **あんな (anna)** refers to something far from both the speaker and the listener, like 「あれ」 (that over there). Imagine the speaker pointing to something in the distance.
  *  **どんな (donna)** is used when asking about the kind of something, similar to 「どれ」 (which).

  These words are informal abbreviations of the more formal forms:

  *  **こんな (konna)** comes from **このような (konoyouna)**
  *  **そんな (sonna)** comes from **そのような (sonoyouna)**
  *  **あんな (anna)** comes from **あのような (anoyouna)**
  *  **どんな (donna)** comes from **どのような (donoyouna)**

  You can use the longer, more formal versions (**そのような**, **このような**, **あのような**, **どのような**) when you want to sound more polite or in more formal settings. Simply place these words directly before the noun they modify.

  kind of over there" (far from both). **どんな** is for asking "what kind of?"
false_friends:
  - term: そういう
    meaning: Like that, Kind of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike そんな, which specifically refers to something related to the listener, 「そういう」 is a more
      general way to say "like that" or "that kind of" without necessarily implying proximity to the listener.
      It focuses more on the content or nature of the thing being described.
  - term: そんなに
    meaning: So (much), That much, Like that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「そんなに」 can sometimes overlap in meaning with そんな when indicating a degree or extent,
      it functions more as an adverb meaning "so much" or "to that extent." For example, 「そんなに食べないで」 (don't
      eat so much) uses 「そんなに」 to modify the verb "eat," whereas そんな modifies a noun.
  - term: いかなる
    meaning: What kind of, No matter what kind of, No … (with a negative verb), Any... (with a negative
      verb)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「いかなる」 is a more formal and stronger way of saying "what kind of" or "any kind of." It often
      appears in more serious or legal contexts. While どんな asks a general question about the type, 「いかなる」
      can emphasize that no matter what the type is, a certain condition applies.
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse these similar expressions. 「そういう」 is a more general
  "like that," 「そんなに」 often modifies verbs to mean "so much," and 「いかなる」 is a formal way of asking "what
  kind of" with a sense of emphasis on all possibilities.
