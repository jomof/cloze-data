writeup: '**をいいことに** is an expression in Japanese that translates to "to take advantage of (A)." It generally
  describes someone using a particular situation or circumstance (A) as an opportune moment to do something,
  often with a negative connotation, implying the action is somewhat immoral, selfish, or irresponsible.
  The structure combines the particle **を**, the い-adjective **良い** (ii - good), the noun **こと** (koto
  - thing/matter), and the particle **に**. A more literal interpretation could be "making good use of
  (A), (B)," but the implied meaning is clearly about leveraging a situation for personal gain, potentially
  at the expense of others or general propriety. **をいいことに** follows nouns, verbs in their plain form +
  **の**, い-adjectives + **の**, and な-adjectives + **なの**. It''s also common to see **～をして** added to the
  end as **をいいことにして**, without a significant change in meaning.'

    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **をいいことに**, **を契機に** generally has a more neutral or positive connotation, focusing

  of taking advantage, often with a negative judgment. Use **を契機に** when the focus is on something being
  the trigger or a positive opportunity for a change or new action.
