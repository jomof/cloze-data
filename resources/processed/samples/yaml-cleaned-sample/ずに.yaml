writeup: |-
  The grammar point **ずに** means "without doing." It's a more formal way of saying **ないで**. Think of **ず** as the classical negative auxiliary verb, similar to **ない**. Adding the particle **に** creates the adverbial form, indicating the manner in which something is done (or not done). You attach **ずに** to the **plain form** of the verb, the same form you'd use before **ない**.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  **Formality:** **ずに** is considered more formal and stiff compared to **ないで**.
  *  **する verbs:** When used with a **する** verb, it becomes **せずに**, not **しずに**. Both **せ** and **し** are indeterminate forms of **する**, but **せ** is the standard form used with **ず**.
