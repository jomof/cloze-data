  When learning じゃない and ではない, we briefly mentioned that these constructions are regularly partnered with the particle か to form a (usually casual) question. This lesson further explores this usage. Unlike じゃない and ではない (which need to come after a noun or な-Adjective), じゃないか can be attached to the end of almost any phrase to indicate a question, similar to finishing a sentence with "isn't it?" in English.

  When じゃないか is too casual, ではないか is used instead. Despite being more formal, ではないか can sometimes sound a bit stiff, so it's best used when politeness is expected.

post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like でしょう, だろう, and ね also function as tag questions, they
  carry different nuances in politeness and assertiveness compared to じゃないか. Expressions like かもしれない and
  ～のだろうか express uncertainty or wonder, whereas じゃないか seeks agreement or confirmation. Remember that じゃない
  is a simple negative and doesn't inherently function as a question like じゃないか does.
