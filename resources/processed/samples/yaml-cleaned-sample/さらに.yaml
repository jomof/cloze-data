  更に is a word that is often used adverbially in Japanese to convey the meaning of "more and more", "even more than (A)", or "again". This usage extends from the core meaning of the kanji 更, which indicates "approaching change". Therefore, the statement following 更に will always describe something that has progressed beyond the initial statement, whether in terms of time, quantity, or intensity. Taking this into account, "in addition to (A)" can also serve as a suitable translation.

  As 更に is used adverbially, it typically appears at the beginning of the latter part (B) of a sentence, after the initial, foundational information has been established.

  **Important Consideration:** The meaning of 更 as "approaching change" suggests that the initial state (A) has reached a point of "fullness" or being "enough". What follows in (B), introduced by 更に, pushes that thing beyond a certain threshold. This progression can be either positive or negative, depending on the context of the sentence.
