  **ともなく** and **ともなしに** are structures used to indicate that action (A) was being done absentmindedly when event (B) happened. It translates as "unconsciously (A) when (B)" or "without paying attention to (A), (B)". This pattern combines the case-marking particle **と**, the adverbial particle **も**, and the conjunctive form of the *i*-adjective **ない**. It follows the dictionary form of verbs. Think of it as meaning something like "even while not intending to (B), while (A), (B)".

  **ともなしに** is similar, but pairs the noun **なし** "without" with **に**, instead of using the conjunctive form of **ない**.

  Both **ともなく** and **ともなしに** often appear in sentences with **たら**. This emphasizes the specific time something happened while another action was being performed absentmindedly.

  **Important Consideration:** While the translation suggests a lack of intention, the action preceding **ともなく** is usually intentional. However, the *result* of that action is not what the person intended or was aiming for.
