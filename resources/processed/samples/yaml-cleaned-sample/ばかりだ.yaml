writeup: The adverbial particle ばかり is combined with verbs in their dictionary form to indicate that something
  is **only** happening, is happening **more and more**, or that something **keeps on** happening. This
  construction emphasizes the continuous nature of an action or change. The phrase utilizes ばかり's basic
  meaning of "only" and combines it with the auxiliary verb だ (or です). This usage of ばかり is frequently
  paired with verbs that describe a change or progression (e.g., increasing/decreasing, strengthening/weakening,
  improving/worsening, speeding up/slowing down). To add further information in the second part of the
  sentence, だ is changed to its conjunctive form で.

  - term: つづける
    meaning: To continue
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ばかりだ」, 「つづける」 simply means 'to continue' without the nuance of 'only' or 'more and
      more'.
  - term: ばかり
    meaning: Just, Only, Nothing but
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「ばかり」 is part of 「ばかりだ」, when used alone it focuses on restricting options rather than
      emphasizing continuous change.
  - term: てくる
    meaning: To come to, To become, To continue, To be starting to, Has been ~ing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「てくる」 indicates a change that has been happening over time and continues into the present,
      similar to 「ばかりだ」, but it doesn't necessarily carry the 'only' or 'more and more' nuance as strongly.
  - term: 一方だ
    meaning: More and more, Continue to, Keep on, -er and -er
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「ばかりだ」, 「一方だ」 emphasizes a continuous trend. However, 「一方だ」 often carries a stronger
      sense of a single direction or inevitability.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「ばかりだ」 specifically highlights the continuous
  nature of a single action or change, often implying that nothing else is happening or that the change
  is intensifying. While the other expressions convey continuation, they may lack the specific emphasis
  on exclusivity or increasing intensity that 「ばかりだ」 provides.
