  **ばかりだ** combines the adverbial particle **ばかり** (only) with the auxiliary verb **だ** (or **です**). It indicates that only one thing is happening, and often implies a sense of continuous change or a trend. This construction is frequently used with verbs describing changes like increasing/decreasing, strengthening/weakening, or improving/worsening. When further information is added to the sentence, **だ** changes to its conjunctive form **で**.

  While commonly used with negative trends, it's important to note that **ばかりだ** can also describe positive trends.

post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, **ばかりだ** emphasizes the continuous nature of an action
  or change. The nuance is that this is the *only* thing happening or the dominant trend. Notice how the
  verbs paired with **ばかりだ** often describe transitions or shifts in state.

false_friends:
  - term: 続ける
    meaning: To continue
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Focuses on the continuation of an action without necessarily implying it's the *only* thing
      happening or a trend.
  - term: ばかり
    meaning: Just, Only, Nothing but
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Indicates exclusivity but doesn't inherently carry the sense of continuous change or a developing
      trend that **ばかりだ** does.
  - term: てくる
    meaning: To come to, To become, To continue, To be starting to, Has been ~ing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Indicates a change or a continuing action from the past leading to the present, but doesn't
      emphasize the exclusivity like **ばかりだ**.
  - term: 一方だ
    meaning: More and more, Continue to, Keep on, -er and -er
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to **ばかりだ** in expressing a continuous trend, but **一方だ** often emphasizes a stronger,
      more unidirectional progression without the explicit "only" meaning.
post_false_friends_writeup: While **続ける (tsuzukeru)** simply means "to continue," **ばかりだ** implies that
  something *only* continues in a certain direction, often suggesting a lack of other changes. **ばかり (bakari)**
  alone means "only" or "nothing but," but when combined with **だ**, it specifically highlights the ongoing
  nature of that exclusive action or state. **てくる (-te kuru)** also indicates a continuing action or change
  over time, but it focuses on the progression *towards* the present, whereas **ばかりだ** emphasizes the
  ongoing nature of the current trend. **一方だ (ippou da)** is very close in meaning to **ばかりだ**, both expressing
  a continuous trend. However, **一方だ** often suggests a more forceful and unwavering progression, while
  **ばかりだ** carries a more direct sense of "only doing this."
