writeup: |-
  「いずれも」 is a formal adverb that essentially means "all," "both," or "any," depending on the context. The base word 「いずれ」 itself is a polite way to say "what," "how," or "where." When you add the particle 「も」, it emphasizes the inclusiveness. Think of it as saying something like, "in any case, even…" or "no matter which one, even…".

  **Key uses of いずれも:**

  *  **Referring to multiple items positively:** It can mean "all of them" or "both of them" when talking about a set of things.
  *  **Referring to multiple items negatively:** It can mean "none of them" when used in a negative sentence or context.
  *  **Indicating alternatives:** It can mean "either one" or "whatever" when presented with choices.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  「いずれも」 is generally considered more formal than simply saying 「全部 (ぜんぶ)」 for "all" or 「両方 (りょうほう)」 for "both."
  *  Pay close attention to the context to understand whether it means "all," "both," or "any." The surrounding words and the overall situation will give you clues.
  *  The phrases 「いずれにしても」、「いずれにせよ」、and 「いずれにしろ」 are common and mean "in any case," "anyway," or "at any rate." They are useful for transitioning to a main point or concluding a discussion.
