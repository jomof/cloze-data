writeup: 「～のが下手（へた）」 means "to be bad at," "poor at," or "unskillful" in something. It describes a lack
  of ability or proficiency in a particular activity. The particle 「の」 nominalizes the preceding verb,
  turning the verb phrase into a noun. The particle 「が」 follows this nominalized phrase because 「下手」 is
  an adjectival noun (形容動詞 - *keiyō dōshi*) and often takes 「が」 to mark the subject it describes. This
  grammar point is very similar to 「のが上手（じょうず）」, which means "to be good at." The verb before 「のが」 is
  always in its **dictionary form** (plain form). If you want to talk about being bad at something in
  the past, only 「下手」 changes to its past tense form, 「下手だった」.

    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「君って」 is an intimate way to address someone, and 「下手くそ」 is a more colloquial and slightly
      stronger way of saying 「下手」, adding a playful, flirty tone. The question form with 「もしかして」 suggests
      playful doubt. 「僕を」 is used by male speakers.

post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse 「のが下手」 with 「のが好き」 or 「のが上手」. Remember that 「下手」
  indicates a lack of skill, 「好き」 indicates liking something, and 「上手」 indicates being skilled. The key
  difference lies in the adjectival noun used at the end of the phrase.
