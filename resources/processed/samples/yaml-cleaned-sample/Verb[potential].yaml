writeup: |-
  The auxiliary verbs **れる** and **られる** are used to express the potential form, meaning "to be able to" or "can". For **る-verbs** (verbs ending in る preceded by an 'i' or 'e' sound, and a few exceptions), attach **られる** to the verb's base form (remove the final る). A common but grammatically informal variation is to drop the ら, using just **れる**. Be aware that this 「ラ抜き言葉」 can sometimes cause ambiguity, especially with passive, respectful, or spontaneous uses of れる/られる. For **う-verbs** (verbs ending in う, く, す, etc.), the final vowel sound changes to the corresponding 'e' sound before adding **る** (e.g., 書く becomes 書ける, 話す becomes 話せる). For **する verbs**, the potential form is expressed using **できる**. While both **ことができる** and the potential form (られる for る-verbs, 〜える for う-verbs) convey the same core meaning, many consider **ことができる** slightly more polite.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  When using the potential form, you can mark the object with either **を** or **が**. However, **できる** can only use **が**.

post_example_writeup: Notice how both the potential form (like 「食べられる」) and 「ことができる」 can express the same
  idea of ability. The choice often depends on the desired level of politeness and the specific verb.
false_friends:
  - term: 得る・得る
    meaning: Is able to, Can, Possible
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 得る also expresses ability, it often implies acquiring or gaining something, whereas
      れる/られる focuses on the inherent capability.
  - term: Verb［れる・られる］
    meaning: Was done to ~ by ~, Done without consent, Done to one's dismay
    kind: homograph
    nuance: The same れる/られる ending can indicate the passive voice. Context is crucial to distinguish between
      potential (being able to do) and passive (something being done to).
  - term: ことができる
    meaning: Can, Be able to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ことができます is a more formal way to express the same potential meaning as れる/られる. It is the standard
      way to express potential for する verbs.
  - term: 聞こえる
    meaning: To be audible, To sound (like), (Can) hear, To be heard
    kind: similar meaning
    nuance: 聞こえる specifically refers to the ability to hear something, often due to external factors rather
      than personal effort. It's a natural potential.
  - term: 見える
    meaning: To be visible, To seem, To be in sight
    kind: similar meaning
    nuance: 見える specifically refers to the ability to see something, often due to external factors rather
      than personal effort. It's a natural potential.
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between the potential form and its similar expressions, pay
  attention to the nuance you want to convey. For inherent ability, れる/られる is direct. For a slightly more
  polite or formal tone, or when using する verbs, opt for ことができる. Distinguish the potential from the passive
  by considering whether the focus is on the ability to perform an action or on being the recipient of
  an action. Finally, remember that 見える and 聞こえる are specific to sight and hearing, often describing things
  that naturally come into view or earshot.
