  「というのは」 combines the particle 「と」, the verb 「言う」 (to say), and the nominalizing particle 「のは」. It's used to introduce a definition, explanation, or reason for something previously mentioned. Essentially, it turns a phrase into a noun, which you then elaborate on. Think of it as saying "(A), and what I mean by (A) is (B)" or "(A), and the reason for that is (B)".

  To use 「というのは」, attach it to the end of the phrase you want to explain (A), and then follow it with your definition or reason (B).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Emphasis on Fact or Discussion:** 「というのは」 often presents information as a fact or highlights a point for discussion.
  *  **Contrast with 「というのも」:** While similar, 「というのも」 primarily focuses on giving a reason or cause. 「というのは」 can be used for definition or reason.
  *  **Abbreviation:** 「というのは」 is often shortened to 「とは」 or 「って」 in casual conversation. Although the form changes, the core function of explaining (A) with (B) remains the same.
  *  **Starting a Sentence:** 「というのは」 can also begin a sentence to add extra information or clarification about something already discussed. In this case, it's similar to saying, "What I mean to say is..." or "Because of that..."

  - term: ことなの
    meaning: (A) is (Description of A), (A) means that (Description of A)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「というのは」, but 「ことなの」 often emphasizes the essence or nature of something. For example,
      「問題は時間がないことなの」 (The problem is that we don't have time).
  - term: ということは
    meaning: That means, That is to say
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ということは」 is used to draw a logical conclusion or inference from a previous statement. For
      example, 「雨が降っているということは、ピクニックは中止だ」 (It's raining, so that means the picnic is canceled).
  - term: ということ
    meaning: ~ing, The ~ that ~ (Nominalization)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ということ」 nominalizes a phrase, turning it into a noun. While it can sometimes be used in a
      similar context to 「というのは」, it doesn't inherently carry the meaning of explanation or definition.
      For example, 「宿題が終わったということを先生に報告した」 (I reported to the teacher that I had finished my homework).
  - term: という (each)
    meaning: Called, Named, Known as, As much as
    kind: synonym

      or 'named'. For example, 「山田さんという人が来た」 (A person named Mr. Yamada came).
  - term: いわゆる
    meaning: What is called, So-called, Generally known
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「いわゆる」 is used to refer to something that is generally known or commonly understood. For example,
      「これは、いわゆる名作だ」 (This is what you would call a masterpiece).
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share some overlap with 「というのは」 in that they involve
  explaining or referring to something, it's important to consider the specific nuance of each. 「ことなの」
  emphasizes the essence, 「ということは」 draws a conclusion, 「ということ」 nominalizes, 「という」 names or describes directly,
  and 「いわゆる」 refers to something commonly known. Understanding these subtle differences will help you
  choose the most appropriate expression.
