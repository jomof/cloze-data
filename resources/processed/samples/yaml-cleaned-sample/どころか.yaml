writeup: どころか is a construction used to strongly negate a preceding statement (A) while emphasizing a
  more extreme or contrasting reality (B). It conveys the idea that not only is A not true, but the actual
  situation is quite the opposite or much more significant. Think of it as saying "not just A, but even
  B" or "far from A, it's actually B". The literal sense involves the noun 所 (tokoro) meaning "place"
  or "point," combined with the question particle か. This can suggest a rhetorical question like, "Is
  it even at that level/point?" The change to どころ often signals a negative or dismissive connotation.
  It can connect to nouns, verbs in their dictionary form, い-adjectives, and the stem of な-adjectives.

      used rhetorically, sometimes as a question to oneself or others.
  - term: どころではない
    meaning: This is not the time for…, Far from, Out of the question
    kind: synonym

post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ものか」, 「どころか」, and 「どころではない」 all express negation, they have slightly
  different nuances. 「ものか」 is often more emphatic and rhetorical, expressing strong denial. 「どころか」 emphasizes
  a contrast between what is said and what is actually the case. 「どころではない」 indicates that something is
  completely out of the question due to the current circumstances. Pay attention to the specific context
  to choose the most appropriate expression.
