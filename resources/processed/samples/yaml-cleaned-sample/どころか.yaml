etymology: 「どころか」 is derived from 「所 (tokoro)」 meaning 'place' or 'situation', combined with the particle
  「か (ka)」, which indicates a question or doubt. The 「ど (do)」 is an alteration of 「と (to)」 that often
  occurs when 「所」 is used negatively. The literal sense is something like, 「Is this even the place/situation
  for that?」, implying that the actual situation is far from what was suggested.
writeup: |-
  「どころか」 combines the noun 「所 (tokoro)」, meaning "place," with the sentence-ending particle 「か」. The change from 「ところ」 to 「どころ」 is a common sound change observed in sentences that use 「所」 negatively.

  「どころか」 can be translated as "far from," "let alone," or "anything but." It strongly negates the statement preceding it while emphasizing what follows. Think of it as saying, "Not only is 'A' not true, but 'B' is the real situation, and it's often the opposite or much more significant than 'A'."

  「どころか」 can be paired with the attributive form (dictionary form for verbs and い-adjectives, stem form for な-adjectives, and plain form for nouns) of the word it modifies. However, it can also be used with the stem form of な-adjectives or directly attached to nouns.

  Sentences using 「どころか」 must always have a second part (B) that emphasizes more important information from the speaker's perspective.

  As 「か」 transforms 「どころ」 into a question or a statement of doubt, the literal translation of 「どころか」 is akin to saying, "It's not even remotely (A)" as a statement, or "Do you honestly think it's (A)?!" as a question.
