writeup: |-
  Although not used much in modern Japanese, the suffix 掛け 'support', or 'hanger' followed by に may occasionally appear after the ます-stem of verbs. When used this way, 掛けに simply means "on the way", "as you go", or "while doing (A)". (B) may just be considered as something done while doing (A), or as being done specifically because (A) is a good opportunity to do it.

  This structure may be used either with or without kanji, so it will be important to remember both.

  **Fun fact**: 掛ける is one of the more difficult verbs in Japanese, as it does not have an exact counterpart in English. However, in most cases it just means to lay, extend, or place something across either a physical or metaphorical surface or span. In this way, it may help to remember (A) as the span from which (B) will occur.

    meaning: On the way, Partway, In the middle of

    kind: synonym

      of the opportunity, whereas 「がけに」 focuses more on the timing of the action during the journey.

  「途中に・途中で」 is a broader term for "on the way" or "in the middle of". 「ついでに」 implies doing something as
  a convenient side action, rather than strictly during a journey.
