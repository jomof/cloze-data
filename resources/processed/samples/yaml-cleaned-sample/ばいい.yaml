  In contrast to **ばよかった**, which expresses regret about a missed opportunity, **ばいい** indicates the speaker's hope for a desired outcome that hasn't occurred yet. It translates to "It'd be good if (X)".

  To form **ばいい**, attach the conjunction particle **ば** to the end of a verb and then add the *i*-adjective **いい**. While literally meaning "if (X), it's good", **ばいい** can also offer gentle advice, similar to "should (X)".

  **Caution**: **ばいい** can also express that the speaker believes something is impossible, often paired with **のに**. This conveys the nuance of "despite it being good if it were (X)", indicating the speaker recognizes that X is desirable but unattainable.
