writeup: The structure **の極み (no kiwami)** combines a noun with the particle の and the noun 極み (kiwami),
  meaning "extremity" or "limit." It expresses the **highest degree** or **peak** of something. You can
  translate it as "the ultimate (A)," "the extreme (A)," or "the epitome of (A)." It can be used for both
  positive and negative situations and feelings. Because 極み itself is a noun, it's often followed by だ
  or です in its plain and polite forms respectively. When connecting to a subsequent clause explaining
  the result of this extreme state, it will take the conjunctive form で.
