writeup: The grammar point **の極み (のきわみ)**, where 極み means "extremity" or "height," is used to express
  the highest degree or extreme of a particular state, feeling, or quality. It translates to "the ultimate,"
  "the extreme," "the utter," "the epitome of," or "the peak of." It's a **formal expression** often found
  in writing or more serious speech. It attaches to a noun using the particle の. This structure can be
  used for both positive and negative situations. Because 極み itself is a noun, it is often followed by
  だ or です, or the conjunctive form で when describing a consequence of the extreme state.
