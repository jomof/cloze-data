writeup: |-
  The pairs **誰か (dareka)** and **どこか (dokoka)** are used to express "someone" or "somewhere" in **positive sentences or questions**. Conversely, **誰も (daremo)** and **どこも (dokomo)** mean "not anyone" or "not anywhere" and are used with **negative verbs**.

  *  **誰か (dareka)**: "someone"
  *  **どこか (dokoka)**: "somewhere"
  *  **誰も (daremo)**: "not anyone", "nobody"
  *  **どこも (dokomo)**: "not anywhere", "nowhere"

  Similar to the grammar point for 誰, these words can also be combined with other particles like **へ (e)**, **に (ni)**, or **と (to)** to add more specific nuance.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  In positive sentences, **か (ka)** attaches directly to the noun (誰 or どこ), modifying its meaning.
  *  In negative sentences, **も (mo)** typically follows other particles, indicating that the negative applies to the entire phrase, not just the noun.
  *  However, **も (mo)** is not exclusive to negative sentences and can appear in affirmative contexts with a different meaning (as seen in the last example).
