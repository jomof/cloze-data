writeup: |-
  The grammar point **ところを** combines the noun **ところ** meaning "place" or "situation" with the particle **を**. It primarily expresses two meanings:

  *  **In spite of / Regardless of (the circumstances):** This usage conveys politeness and apology for interrupting someone or imposing on them in their current situation. It often appears when asking for a favor or expressing gratitude for someone's actions despite their busyness or other circumstances. **ところを** follows nouns with **の**, な-adjectives with **な**, い-adjectives in their dictionary form, and verbs in their dictionary form.
  *  **When / While (an action is in progress):** This usage emphasizes that an action was interrupted by another. It can have both positive and negative connotations depending on the context. **ところを** in this sense exclusively follows verbs in their dictionary form.

  The particle **を** can sometimes be omitted, but the meaning remains the same. While some resources may treat these two usages as separate grammar points, it's helpful to understand them as variations of the same concept: acknowledging or utilizing a specific situation.
