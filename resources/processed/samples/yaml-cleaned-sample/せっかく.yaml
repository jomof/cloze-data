  折角（せっかく) is an idiomatic adverb that is often used to express doing something "with trouble", "at great pains", or to refer to something being a "rare" or "long-awaited occasion". As an adverb that often modifies the meaning of a whole sentence, it commonly appears at the beginning of a statement. When 折角 is used to indicate an event is long-awaited, it appears directly before the event, often separated only by the case-marking particle の.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  折角 implies that some effort, time, or planning was involved. It often carries a slight nuance of disappointment or regret if the effort was in vain.
  *  When used with the nuance of "might as well...", it suggests taking advantage of a situation where some effort has already been made.
  *  The phrase 折角の can be used to emphasize the special nature of an event or opportunity.
