  Although originally a combination of the auxiliary verb だ, and the case-marking particle の, だの is considered to be a standalone adverbial particle in modern Japanese that is used in the same way as structures like など and とか in presenting examples. Due to this, it will often be translated as "and things like (A)", or "(A) and whatnot". だの will only be used when at least two examples are given, with each of those examples being followed by だの. Usually, these two things are either opposites of each other, or two things that share the same negative trait.

  だの may appear after verbs, い-Adjectives, nouns, or quotations.

  **Caution:** In situations where the words that だの is attached to are opposites, it will be exhibiting a large range to which the same rule applies. However when the words are similar, it is usually expressing things within that specific category as being undesirable. Because of this, regardless of what the words are, the overall statement itself aims to emphasize the speaker's feelings of frustration or boredom in relation to things that fall under that category, or that scope.
