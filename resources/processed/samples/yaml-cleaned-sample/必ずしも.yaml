writeup: '**必ずしも** (kanarazushimo) expresses that something is not always the case or not entirely true.
  It combines the adverb **必ず** (kanarazu), meaning "certainly" or "invariably," with the adverbial particles
  **し** (shi) and **も** (mo). The combination of **し** and **も** often emphasizes the word preceding them,
  potentially leading to a literal interpretation close to "absolutely certainly." However, **必ずしも** is
  exclusively used in negative sentences. Therefore, while it might seem to imply strong certainty, it
  functions to negate that certainty, conveying meanings like "not always (A)," "not entirely (A)," or
  "not necessarily (A)." It''s frequently placed at the beginning of a clause to introduce a statement
  that presents a qualified or non-absolute perspective.'

post_example_writeup: Notice how **必ずしも** appears at the beginning of the sentence or clause, setting
  the stage for a statement that qualifies a general assumption. The following negative verb or negative
  expression is crucial for conveying the intended meaning of "not always," "not entirely," or "not necessarily."

  - term: とは限らない
    meaning: Not necessarily so, Is not always true, There is no guarantee that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Expresses a lack of guarantee or certainty about something being true in all cases.
  - term: というものでもない
    meaning: There is no guarantee that…, Not necessarily
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Indicates that something is not the only possibility or not true in every instance.
post_false_friends_writeup: While **とは限らない** and **というものでもない** share a similar meaning with **必ずしも**,
  there are subtle differences. **とは限らない** directly states that something isn't always the case or guaranteed.
  **というものでもない** suggests that something is not the *only* possibility or a universal truth. To avoid confusion,
  focus on whether you want to emphasize the lack of absolute certainty (**必ずしも**), the absence of a guarantee
  (**とは限らない**), or the existence of other possibilities (**というものでもない**).
