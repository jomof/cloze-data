  **必ずしも (kanarazushimo)** expresses that something is not always true, not entirely the case, or not a necessity. It's crucial to remember that **必ずしも** is used exclusively with negative verb endings or negative polarity items.

  While often considered a single adverb, **必ずしも** is formed from the adverb **必ず (kanarazu)** meaning "invariably" or "certainly," combined with the adverbial particles **し (shi)** and **も (mo)**. The combination of **し** and **も** often strengthens the preceding word's meaning, giving a sense of "absolutely certainly."

  However, because it's only used in negative contexts, the overall meaning becomes the opposite: "not absolutely certainly." This is why it translates to phrases like "not always," "not entirely," or "not necessarily." **必ずしも** often appears at the beginning of a clause, setting the stage for a statement that isn't 100% absolute.

  - japanese: 男の人は必ずしも強いわけではない。
    english: Men are not always strong.
  - japanese: 刑務所にいる人たちは必ずしも犯罪を犯したとは限らない。
    english: People in prison are not necessarily there because they committed a crime.
  - japanese: 女の人は必ずしも買い物が好きだとは言えない。
    english: Women don't always love shopping.

    english: You won't necessarily become more proficient.
  - japanese: 先生だけど、必ずしも良い人とは限りません。
    english: Even though he's a teacher, it doesn't necessarily mean he's a good person.
  - japanese: 失敗は必ずしも悪いわけではない。
    english: Failure is not always a bad thing.

post_example_writeup: Notice in the examples how **必ずしも** is paired with a negative verb ending like **ではない**,
  **とは限らない**, or a negative polarity item like **わけではない**. This is a fundamental characteristic of this
  grammar point. You'll often see patterns like "**必ずしも** X というわけではない (kanarazushimo X to iu wake dewa
  nai)" meaning "it's not necessarily the case that X" or "**必ずしも** X とは限らない (kanarazushimo X to wa kagiranai)"
  which also conveys "not necessarily X".

post_false_friends_writeup: While **とは限らない (to wa kagiranai)** and **というものでもない (to iu mono de mo nai)**
  share a similar meaning with **必ずしも**, there are slight nuances. **とは限らない** focuses on the idea that
  there's no guarantee or absolute certainty. For instance, saying 「努力すれば必ず成功するとは限らない (doryoku sureba
  kanarazu seikou suru to wa kagiranai)」 emphasizes that effort doesn't guarantee success. **というものでもない**
  is a bit broader and can suggest that something isn't the *only* possibility or that there are other
  valid cases. For example, 「高い料理が必ずしも美味しいというものでもない (takai ryouri ga kanarazushimo oishii to iu mono de
  mo nai)」 suggests that expensive food isn't the only type of delicious food; other less expensive options
  can be delicious too. While these differences are subtle, paying attention to the specific context can
  help you choose the most appropriate expression.
