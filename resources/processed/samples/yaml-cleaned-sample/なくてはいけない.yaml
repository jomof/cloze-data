  Much like てはいけない, なくてはいけない states that something "must not" be done. However, this is where the similarities end. なくてはいけない is an example of a double negative in Japanese, and actually has the meaning "(A) must be done", or "must do (A)". While this grammar point is usually translated as "must do", the literal translation is "must not, not do (A)". This double 'not' is where many learners have difficulties. いけない simply means "cannot go", and comes from the negative potential form of 行く. To use this structure, simply create the negative form of a verb, and then convert ない to なく (the conjunctive form of an い-Adjective), followed by て. After this, は is added, and then finally いけない. いけない is considered to be the most common structure used with the "must", and "must not" grammar points, and is natural in both speech, and written Japanese. Alternatively, ならない may be used in formal speech, but is much better suited to writing. だめ is also acceptable, but much more casual than either いけない or ならない.

  **Caution:**
  The ては in なくては is often converted to ちゃ, as this is easier to say. なくちゃ may then be followed by いけない, or いけない may be omitted, without changing the meaning. These casual structures are very similar to words like 'gotta' in English.
examples:
  - japanese: 明日、君の家に行かなくちゃ。
    english: Tomorrow, I gotta go to your house.
    conjugation: very casual
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「なくちゃ」 instead of 「なくてはいけない」 makes the sentence sound more casual and friendly,
      suitable for speaking to a friend. The speaker's gender is implied by the slightly more direct tone.
  - japanese: もう遅いから、帰らなくちゃいけない。
    english: It's late already, so I have to go home.
    conjugation: casual
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「帰らなくちゃいけない」 is a common way to express obligation in a relatively polite but not overly formal
      way. While not explicitly marked for gender, this phrasing is natural for female speakers.
  - japanese: すみません、この書類を今日中に提出しなくてはいけません。
    english: Excuse me, I have to submit these documents by the end of the day.
    conjugation: plain
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of the full form 「なくてはいけません」 with 「すみません」 indicates a polite and formal register appropriate
      for a professional setting.
  - japanese: 週末は、君に会いにいかなくちゃな。
    english: On the weekend, I've gotta go see you.
    conjugation: very casual
    register: shitashii kuchō
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The 「～なくちゃな」 ending, combined with the context of wanting to see the listener, adds a slightly
      more masculine and assertive, yet still casual and flirty tone. 「な」 is a sentence-ending particle
      often used by males in informal speech.
  - japanese: 明日初めて君と会うから、ちゃんとした服を着なくちゃ。
    english: Since I'm meeting you for the first time tomorrow, I have to wear proper clothes.
    conjugation: very casual
    register: casual
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Using 「～なくちゃ」 shows a casual and slightly excited tone appropriate for preparing for a first
      meeting. The speaker is likely trying to make a good impression.
  - japanese: 昔の恋人のことを忘れなくちゃいけなかった。
    english: I had to forget about my former lover.
    conjugation: past casual
    register: reflective
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: The past tense 「～なくちゃいけなかった」 indicates a past obligation or necessity, fitting the reflective
      and melancholic tone of reminiscing about a past relationship.
  - japanese: あなたのためなら、どんな無理難題でも聞かなくちゃいけない気がする。
    english: For you, I feel like I have to listen to any unreasonable demands.
    conjugation: plain
    register: semi-formal
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「聞かなくちゃいけない気がする」 expresses a feeling of obligation, and in this context, it's used flirtatiously
      to exaggerate the speaker's willingness to do anything for the listener. The phrase 「気がする」 softens
      the directness.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, the level of formality can be adjusted by choosing different
  forms of the grammar point. 「なくてはいけません」 is the most formal, while 「なくちゃ」 is the most casual. The choice
  depends on the relationship between the speaker and listener, and the context of the conversation.

post_false_friends_writeup: While many of these expressions share the core meaning of 'must do', the level
  of formality and nuance can differ. Pay attention to the context and your relationship with the listener
  to choose the most appropriate expression. For expressing prohibition, use 「てはいけない」, and for expressing
  lack of obligation, use 「なくてもいい」. The other synonyms like 「なければならない」 and 「ねばならない」 tend to be more formal
  than 「なくてはいけない」, while 「なくちゃ」 and 「ないと」 are more casual.
