  In Japanese, to describe a noun with an action, you use a relative clause. This involves placing the verb **directly before** the noun it modifies. The verb will usually be in the **past tense (た-form)** or the **continuous tense (ている-form)**.

  Think of it like this: instead of saying "Takashi-san is a man. He lives in Tokyo," you combine the information into "Takashi-san is a man who lives in Tokyo." In Japanese, you achieve this by putting the verb 「住んでいる」 right before the noun 「男」, creating 「東京に住んでいる男」.

  *  The **た-form** indicates an action that has been completed in the past relative to the noun. For example, 「友達から借りたペン」 (a pen borrowed from a friend) means the borrowing happened before the present moment.
  *  The **ている-form** indicates an ongoing action or a state resulting from a past action. For instance, 「日本に住んでいる外国人」 (a foreigner living in Japan) describes someone currently in the state of living in Japan.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The polite ます-form of verbs **cannot** be used directly before a noun in a relative clause.

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female

      common in informal speech. 「似合ってるよ」 is a direct compliment, made more casual with the 「よ」.
    etymology: The contraction of 「～ている」 to 「～てる」 is a common phonetic change in casual Japanese.

    nuance: 「ご注文になった」 is the honorific form of 「注文した」, used to show respect to the customer. 「～になります」
      is a polite way of saying 「～です」 in a service setting.
post_example_writeup: Remember that the verb always comes before the noun it modifies. This might be different
  from how you form relative clauses in English, so practice getting comfortable with this word order.
