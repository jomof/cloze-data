writeup: 反面 (hanmen) is a noun meaning "the opposing side." Grammatically, it connects two phrases to
  highlight contrasting or opposite aspects of a single subject. Think of it as saying, "While (one thing
  is true), the opposite is also true." It often translates to "while (A), (B)", "although (A), also (B)",
  or "on the other hand, (B), given (A)." Because 反面 is a noun, it follows words that modify nouns, such
  as verbs and adjectives. You can use it after verbs and い-adjectives in their dictionary form. For な-adjectives
  and nouns, you'll use the である form (or plain form だ in casual speech). **Important Consideration:**
  反面 emphasizes a contrast, usually between a positive and a negative aspect. It's generally not used
  to describe two positive or two negative points.

      contradictory aspects of the same subject, or even two separate but related situations. 反面 usually
      has a stronger sense of opposition.
post_false_friends_writeup: When deciding between 反面, に対して, and 一方で, consider whether you are highlighting
  contrasting characteristics of one thing (反面), contrasting two distinct things (に対して), or presenting
  two different but potentially related aspects (一方で). 反面 specifically emphasizes a somewhat opposing
  nature, often between a positive and negative trait.
