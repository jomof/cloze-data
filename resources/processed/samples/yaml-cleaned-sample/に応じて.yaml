writeup: |-
  に応じて is a combination of に, and the て-form of the る-Verb 応じる "to apply to". This grammar structure is often translated as "depending on (A), (B)", or "in response to (A), (B)". However, in almost all cases, it simply indicates that (B) is something that is done in a way that is 'applicable' to what is necessary for (A).

  に応じて will appear after nouns, or as に応じた when directly modifying a second noun.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  応じる usually indicates the way something "responds to" or "answers" an issue on a case-by-case basis. Due to this, what happens in (B) will frequently indicate something that changes depending on the intensity or severity of (A).
  *  Think of it as tailoring your actions or decisions to fit the specific situation or conditions presented by (A).
