  たちまち is an adverb that conveys the feeling of something happening **suddenly** or **in a flash**. A key nuance of たちまち compared to similar words is that it suggests the event occurred **spontaneously** and was difficult to control. Often, たちまち indicates the transition into a new, ongoing state or the completion of something. It usually appears directly before the verb phrase describing this new state.

  **Etymology:** Interestingly, たちまち originally comes from the kanji structure 忽ち, where the kanji itself means "without thought." This sense of immediacy and lack of premeditation is still present in the meaning of たちまち. However, the kanji form is rarely used in modern writing.
