writeup: もさることながら is a construction in Japanese that is often translated as "it goes without saying that
  (A), but (B)", or "not only (A), but (B) too". This expression is a combination of the adverbial particle
  も, the pre-noun adjectival さる meaning "particular" or "certain", the noun 事 meaning "thing", and the
  conjunction particle ながら meaning "while". Due to this, a more literal understanding is "while (A) is
  also of particular merit, (B)". This helps to remember that もさることながら always presents (A) as important,
  but (B) as even more important. もさることながら is attached to the end of nouns and noun phrases. As (B) is
  being emphasized, it is common to see other expressions of emphasis combined with もさることながら, such as
  さらに ("additionally"), なにより ("more than anything"), and 以上 ("above that").

  - term: ～というのは事実だ
    meaning: It is a fact that ~, There is no doubt that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「もさることながら」, 「～というのは事実だ」 simply states a fact without necessarily implying a comparison
      or an 'even more so' nuance. It's a more direct affirmation.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「～というのは事実だ」 and 「もさることながら」 both acknowledge a fact, 「もさることながら」 goes
  a step further by introducing a second, often more emphasized, point. If you want to simply state a
  fact, use 「～というのは事実だ」. If you want to say 'it's true that A, but B is even more...', then use 「もさることながら」.
