writeup: |-
  いらっしゃる is another of the common **honorific language** expressions in Japanese. This means that it elevates the status of another person, in order to pay them respect. It will **never** be used when referring to the speaker themselves, or their own actions.

  いらっしゃる can be used to replace 居る "to be", 来る "to come", or 行く "to go". This is due to the unique perspective that honorific language places the speaker in, in relation to the person that is being respected. This is a slightly advanced concept that we will discuss more later.

  To use いらっしゃる, simply replace いる, くる, or いく with いらっしゃる. Alternatively, いらっしゃる may also be used to replace いる, くる, or いく when they are attached to the て-form of another verb.

  **Fun Fact:** おいでになる is another expression which can replace いる, くる, or いく. This was briefly examined previously in our お～になる grammar point. おいでになる and いらっしゃる are almost completely interchangeable.

  - term: くる
    meaning: To come
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike いらっしゃる, 「くる」 is the plain form of "to come" and doesn't show respect to the person

post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between いらっしゃる and these other verbs, consider the level of
  respect you need to convey. Use いらっしゃる when speaking about the being, arrival, or departure of someone
  you want to show respect to. Use the other forms for yourself or when formality isn't required.
