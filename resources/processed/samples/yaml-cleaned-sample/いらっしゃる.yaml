  **いらっしゃる** is a common honorific expression in Japanese. It elevates the status of the person being spoken about as a sign of respect. It is never used to refer to the speaker or their own actions.

  **いらっしゃる** can replace the verbs **いる** (to be), **来る** (to come), and **行く** (to go). This replacement reflects the perspective inherent in honorific language, where the speaker positions themselves lower than the person being respected. This concept will be explored in more detail later.

  To use **いらっしゃる**, simply substitute **いる**, **来る**, or **行く** with **いらっしゃる**.

  Alternatively, **いらっしゃる** can also replace **いる**, **来る**, or **行く** when they are attached to the **て-form** of another verb.

  **Fun Fact:** **おいでになる** is another expression that can replace **いる**, **来る**, or **行く**. This was covered in the **お～になる** grammar point. **おいでになる** and **いらっしゃる** are almost completely interchangeable.

post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, **いらっしゃる** can be used in various situations. Notice how
  it replaces **いる** in the first example to politely ask about someone's wife. In other examples, it
  replaces **来る** and **行く** to talk about superiors or customers in a respectful way. The phrase "いらっしゃいませ！"
  is a fixed expression used to welcome customers, highlighting the honorific nature of the verb.

post_false_friends_writeup: While **お～になる** also expresses respect, it's used to elevate actions, not
  existence or movement. For instance, you would use **お読みになる** (to read honorifically) to talk about
  someone reading. On the other hand, **いる**, **来る**, and **へ行く** are their non-honorific counterparts.
  They are used for neutral statements about being, coming, and going without any added politeness. To
  avoid confusion, remember that **いらっしゃる** specifically replaces these basic verbs when speaking respectfully
  about someone else's presence or movement.
