writeup: |-
  When paired with まま, meaning "in the state of", and the case marking particle に, the auxiliary verbs れる and られる indicate something being done "as one is told", or "as ordered". Because of this, れる and られる will almost always be paired with verbs that indicate some kind of communication. As these structures are in the passive, the literal translation is close to "to do (B) in the state that (A) was done to me". The (B) part will come directly after ままに and simply states how someone is going to react in compliance with (A). The conjunction particle が may appear between られる and ままに, but this is not common in modern Japanese. Although it does carry the meaning of "but", the focus is more on expressing that the (A) is not being resisted or argued with when doing (B).

  **Important Consideration:** In this grammar pattern, られる will **never** appear in the past-tense form.
