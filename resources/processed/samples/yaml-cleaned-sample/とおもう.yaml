writeup: |-
  To express that **you** "think" something in Japanese, the common expression `と思う` is regularly used. As you can probably guess, this is just a combination of the particle `と`, plus the u-Verb `思う`. `とおもう` can be used after any verb, い-Adjective, な-Adjective, or noun, but will require `だ` after a noun or な-Adjective. Although this structure usually requires `だ` after nouns and な-Adjectives, it is often omitted in casual speech.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  If you want to express what **somebody else** is thinking, `と思っている` will be used. This is due to `思う` having a sense of "permanence", and thus not something that the speaker could directly know about another person's internal state.
  *  `と思っている` can also be used to express **your own thoughts** when they are currently happening or are more of an ongoing state of mind.

    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The male speaker uses 「君」, a familiar term for 'you', and the 「〜よ」 adds a soft emphasis. The
      direct invitation 「着てデートに行かない?」 makes the intent clear.
    etymology: デート is a loanword from English.
post_example_writeup: Remember that while 「と思う」 is used for expressing your own thoughts, 「と思っている」 is
  crucial for talking about what someone else thinks or for emphasizing the ongoing nature of your own
  thoughts.

  - term: 〜ようと思う・〜おうと思う
    meaning: I think I will, I think I shall, Going to, Gonna (Volitional + と思う)

    nuance: Unlike 「とおもう」 which expresses a general thought or opinion, 「〜ようと思う」 expresses an intention
      or decision. It indicates a plan you've made.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「とおもう」 is about what you *believe* or *consider*
  to be true, while 「〜ようと思う」 is about what you *plan* to do. The former is a statement of thought, the
  latter is a statement of intent.
