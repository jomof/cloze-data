writeup: をものともせず combines the accusative particle を, the noun 物 (mono) meaning "thing", the particle とも
  which here emphasizes "even", and the negative auxiliary verb ず (ず, classical negative form of する).
  The overall meaning conveys the idea of **not making something a problem or obstacle**, acting as if
  it doesn't matter. It suggests a **strong will or determination** in the face of adversity. It's crucial
  to remember that をものともせず is used to describe **someone else's actions**, not the speaker's own.
