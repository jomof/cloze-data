  「がち」 is a suffix in Japanese that attaches to **nouns** or the **conjunctive form (masu-stem)** of verbs. It conveys that something is "apt to (A)", "tends to (A)", or "is prone to (A)". While not exclusively negative, 「がち」 is most frequently used to describe undesirable tendencies or outcomes.

  **Etymology:** Interestingly, 「がち」 originates from the word 「勝ち(かち)」, meaning "a win". This connection can help understand the nuance of 「がち」. Think of it as something "winning out" as the more likely scenario. Even though other possibilities exist, the action or state described by the word it's attached to is what frequently "wins". This tendency can stem from habit, circumstance, or inherent qualities.
