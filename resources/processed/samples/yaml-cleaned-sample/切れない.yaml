  The grammar point **切れない (kirenai)** is formed by attaching the negative potential form of 切る (kiru), which is 切れない, to the conjunctive form (masu-stem) of another verb. It expresses the idea that a particular action is **impossible to complete**. While 切る can mean to do something to the point of exhaustion or running out, 切れない often implies the opposite: there's **too much** of something to finish it, or the task is impossible to bring to a satisfactory conclusion.

  Consider these key aspects:

  *  **Inability due to quantity:** Often, 切れない indicates that there's an overwhelming amount, making completion infeasible (e.g., "too many stars to count").
  *  **Inability due to degree:** It can also express the impossibility of reaching a desired level of completion or satisfaction (e.g., "cannot express my feelings enough").

  limitations (like not being able to eat a large portion) or emotional ones (like being unable to express
  feelings fully). The context usually makes it clear whether the inability is due to sheer quantity or
  the impossibility of reaching a satisfactory end.

  - term: かねる
    meaning: Cannot, Be unable to, Hard to, Hesitant to

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 切れない specifically means something cannot
  be *finished*. While other expressions like かねる and 〜得ない also indicate inability, they might imply different
  nuances, such as difficulty or formality. Conversely, expressions like てしまう, 上がる, and 切る (when used
  to mean 'completely') emphasize completion, making them direct opposites of 切れない.
