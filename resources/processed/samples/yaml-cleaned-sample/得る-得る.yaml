writeup: |-
  **得る** is a る-verb that means "to gain" or "to acquire." When attached to the conjunctive form (ます-stem) of verbs, it adds the nuance of "for (A) to be possible" or "to be able to (A)." Compared to **できる**, which indicates the potential to do something, **得る** suggests something closer to "there is a possibility that (A) can be done" or "the possibility to do (A) has been gained."

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Pronunciation:** 得る can be read as either **える** or **うる**. While **うる** is an older form less common in everyday speech, it tends to be preferred when the preceding kana is え, such as 教える becoming 教えうる rather than 教ええる.
  *  **Formality:** 得る is generally more formal and bookish than できる. However, certain set phrases using this grammar point are very common in daily conversation, such as **あり得る** ("possible") and **あり得ない** ("impossible").

  - term: 〜得ない
    meaning: Unable to, Cannot
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 得る which indicates possibility, 〜得ない directly expresses impossibility. For example,
      「信じ得る」 means 'can believe', while 「信じ得ない」 means 'cannot believe'.
  - term: れる・られる (Potential)
    meaning: To be able, Can (Potential)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both express ability, れる/られる (potential form) often focuses on inherent capability or
      general possibility, whereas 得る emphasizes the possibility of something happening or being done
      in a particular context. For example, 「日本語を話せる」 means 'can speak Japanese' (general ability), while
      「この状況で成功し得る」 means 'it is possible to succeed in this situation'.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 得る with 〜得ない and れる/られる, remember that 得る focuses on the
  possibility of an action or event. 〜得ない directly negates this possibility. The potential form (れる/られる)
  often refers to a general ability, whereas 得る is more context-dependent, highlighting whether something
  can occur in a given situation.
