false_friends:
  - term: からこそ
    meaning: Emphasized because, Precisely because
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「～てこそ」 indicates a necessary condition, 「からこそ」 emphasizes the *reason* something is
      the way it is. 「苦労したからこそ、今の私がある」 (Because I went through hardship, that's why I am who I am now)
      focuses on the cause, while 「苦労してこそ、今の私がある」 focuses on the necessity of the hardship.
  - term: こそ
    meaning: For sure, For certain, Even more so, Underlined or bolded text
    kind: related
    nuance: 「こそ」 by itself emphasizes a preceding noun or pronoun. 「あなたこそ私の全てです」 (You are indeed my everything)
      highlights 'you'. 「～てこそ」 attaches to a verb in the te-form to create a conditional meaning.
  - term: ～ばこそ
    meaning: Precisely because, Only because, Because, Due to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「～ばこそ」 is a more literary or archaic equivalent of 「からこそ」, also emphasizing the reason or
      cause. It's not as commonly used in everyday conversation as 「～てこそ」 or 「からこそ」.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「～てこそ」 highlights the necessity of a condition
  for a subsequent outcome. 「からこそ」 emphasizes the reason or cause of something. 「こそ」 acts as an intensifier
  for nouns, and 「～ばこそ」 is a more formal way of expressing 'because'.
