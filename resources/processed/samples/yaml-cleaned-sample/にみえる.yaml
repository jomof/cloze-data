writeup: |-
  「にみえる」 (primarily written only in hiragana) is a phrase that combines the case-marking particle 「に」 with the る-verb 「見える」 meaning "to appear" or "to be visible." This construction is regularly used with nouns to show that something "appears to be (A)." It can also be partnered with the adverbial forms of the auxiliary verbs 「ようだ」 or 「そうだ」 (「ように」 and 「そうに」 respectively) to add a level of uncertainty, making it sound closer to "to seem to be (A)" in English. Similar to other 「ようだ」 structures, 「みたい」 can be used instead, creating the expression 「みたいにみえる」, which reinforces the speaker's guess and means "to look like something that could be (A).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  In grammar constructions like this, kanji will very rarely be used for 「にみえる」. This is primarily because it can change the way a native speaker perceives the meaning. Many grammar structures are written purely in hiragana to emphasize that they are a **set construction**. Adding kanji can lead a reader to assume that the writer is highlighting the kanji's literal meaning of 見える, rather than the more common grammatical meaning of appearing or seeming.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「にみえる」 specifically relates to visual appearances.
  While other similar expressions can indicate seeming or appearing, they often involve different senses
  or methods of inference. Pay attention to the particle 「に」 which often links a noun or noun-like phrase
  to the appearance. Also, be mindful of the level of certainty each expression conveys; 「にみえる」 often
  implies a direct visual impression, sometimes with a slight degree of subjective interpretation.
