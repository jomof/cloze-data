writeup: The grammar point **てならない** combines the て-form of a verb or adjective (or で for な-adjectives)
  with the negative form of the verb なる (**ならない**). It expresses a feeling or state that is very strong
  or unavoidable, often translating to "very (adjective)" or "can't help but feel (emotion)". It's important
  to note that the feeling or state described is usually something that arises naturally and continues
  over time, rather than a momentary sensation. A more literal nuance might be "to be unable to escape
  the feeling of...", emphasizing the intensity and persistence of the emotion or state.

post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share a similar sense of intensity or unavoidability,
  it's important to consider the specific nuance each one conveys. 「ざるを得ない」 and 「ないわけにはいかない」 highlight
  obligation, 「てたまらない」 emphasizes desire, 「てしょうがない」 can imply resignation, 「ことに」 focuses on a particular
  aspect, 「ずにはいられない」 denotes irresistible urges, and 「Adj限りだ」 signifies reaching the peak of a feeling.
  Choosing the right expression depends on the specific context and the shade of meaning you want to convey.
