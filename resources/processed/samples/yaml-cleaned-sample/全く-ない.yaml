writeup: 全く～ない is an expression that combines the adverb 全く with a word in its ない form. It translates
  to "not at all (A)". The kanji 全 literally means "whole" or "entire", so 全く can be understood as "completely
  not (A)" or "entirely not (A)". Like many adverbs, 全く can be placed at the beginning of a sentence or
  directly before the element it modifies. Both the kanji 全く and the hiragana まったく are commonly used.
  It's important to note the similarity with 全然, another grammar point used to express a complete lack
  of something. However, 全く often carries a slightly more formal and serious tone compared to 全然, which
  is more prevalent in casual conversation.

  wish to convey.
