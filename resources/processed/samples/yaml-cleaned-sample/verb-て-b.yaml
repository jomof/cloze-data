writeup: The **て form** of a verb, followed by another verb phrase, indicates a sequence of actions. It's
  often translated as "and then" or "after that." Think of it as a way to list things you do in order.
  **Important Consideration:** This grammar point emphasizes the chronological order of events. If the
  order isn't significant, or if you want to list actions in no particular order, you'd use a different
  structure like **たり～たりする**.

post_example_writeup: The て-form is a fundamental building block for expressing sequences of actions in
  Japanese. Pay attention to the order of the verbs as it reflects the order in which the events occurred.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[て] + B①
    meaning: Non-sequence, And, But (Contrast), Parallel action/state
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「Verb + て + B」 which focuses on sequential actions, 「Verb[て] + B①」 can express simultaneous
      actions or contrasting situations. For example, 「彼は歌を歌って、彼女は踊った。」 (He sang a song, and she danced.)
      describes simultaneous actions, not necessarily one after the other.
  - term: Verb + て
    meaning: And, Then (Linking events)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While superficially similar, 「Verb + て」 at the end of a sentence can act as a conjunction,
      but it doesn't necessarily imply a direct subsequent action like 「Verb + て + B」. It often leaves
      the sentence incomplete, inviting continuation or implying a reason.
  - term: Adjective + て・Noun + で
    meaning: And... (Conjunctive)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「Adjective + て」 and 「Noun + で」 link descriptive states or nouns, not actions. For instance,
      「静かで美しい場所です。」 (It's a quiet and beautiful place.) describes simultaneous qualities, not sequential
      events.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「Verb + て + B」 specifically indicates a
  sequence of actions performed by the same subject. If you want to describe simultaneous actions, contrasting
  situations, or link descriptions rather than actions, you'll need to use the other forms mentioned.
