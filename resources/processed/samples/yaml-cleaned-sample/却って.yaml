details:
  Register: Formal
  使用域: 硬い
writeup: The adverb **却って (かえって)** is used to express that a result is the opposite of what was expected
  or intended. It conveys a sense of something turning out contrary to expectations, often with a negative
  or undesirable outcome. Think of it as "instead" in the sense of "rather than that, this happened".
  The nuance is that the speaker is stepping back from the initial action or expectation to highlight
  the actual, often undesirable, outcome. It is generally considered a more formal or stiff (**硬い**) expression.
examples:
  - japanese: 手伝ってくれてるのはありがたいけど、却って邪魔になってるからあっちに行ってくれる?ごめんね。
    english: I appreciate you trying to help, but on the contrary, you're actually in the way, so could
      you go over there? Sorry.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The speaker uses the casual 「～くれる?」 and 「ごめんね」, appropriate for a friendly setting. The use
      of 「却って邪魔になってる」 emphasizes that the help is having the opposite of the intended effect.
  - japanese: お母さんを元気にさせるつもりだったけど、却って怒らせてしまった。
    english: I intended to cheer my mom up, but instead I ended up making her angry.

      highlights the contrast between the intention and the result.

    english: When someone tells me "Do your homework!", on the contrary, it makes me not want to do it
      at all.
    register: casual slang
    setting: humorous
    nuance: The use of 「～んだよね」 adds a casual, almost complaining tone. The slangy nature fits the humorous
      setting. 「却ってやりたくなくなる」 emphasizes the counterintuitive reaction to being told what to do.
  - japanese: 遅く走った方が安全だと思うかもしれないけど却って危ないから、高速道路ではスピードを落とさないで。

      slow down on the highway.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative

      or advice.

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female

      casual male speech. 「却って泣かせちゃった」 clearly indicates the opposite of the intended outcome.

    english: While I appreciate you trying to help, on the contrary, you are being a nuisance.

      the ironic and contrary outcome.

      B: That's right. Because on the contrary, there are cases where surgery can actually worsen the condition.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: sympathetic
    nuance: The phrase 「～ちゃったよ」 in A's statement is casual. B's response uses 「～ますからね」, which is a semi-formal
      way of providing an explanation or reassurance, showing sympathy. 「却って悪化する場合もあります」 offers a contrasting
      possibility to the initial worry.
  - japanese: 言い訳をすればするほど、却って悪い印象を与えることになりますよ。

  surprise, or preference.
