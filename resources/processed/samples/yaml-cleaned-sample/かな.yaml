writeup: The sentence-ending particle **かな** expresses a sense of **wonder**, **doubt**, or **questioning**
  something to oneself. It's like thinking aloud, "I wonder if...?" or "Could it be that...?" It combines
  the questioning nuance of **か** and the self-directed thought of **な**. While historically considered
  more feminine, **かな** is now commonly used by both men and women in everyday conversation.

  「はたして」 often implies a stronger degree of doubt or can have other meanings depending on context.
