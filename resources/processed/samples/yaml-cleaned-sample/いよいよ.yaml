  **いよいよ** is an adverb primarily written in hiragana. It conveys a sense of something reaching its final stage or climax, often after a period of anticipation or build-up. It can express that something has **finally happened** after a long wait or that a situation is **increasing or intensifying**.

  - When used to mean **"finally"** or **"at last,"** it suggests that a long-awaited event is about to occur or has just occurred. This usage often implies a sense of excitement, anticipation, or even relief.
  - When used to mean **"more and more,"** it indicates that a situation is progressively intensifying or becoming more pronounced.

  While **いよいよ** is generally considered casual, its precise nuance depends heavily on the context. Compared to similar expressions like **ついに**, **いよいよ** often carries a stronger sense of anticipation or building momentum.

    english: Tomorrow is finally our graduation, huh...

      in casual speech.

      contraction of 「〜なければならない」.

      to the typhoon's approach.

      more elevated feel.

  a process (**finally**) and the intensification of a state (**more and more**). Pay close attention
  to the context to discern the intended meaning.
false_friends:
  - term: 一方だ
    meaning: More and more, Continue to, Keep on, -er and -er
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **いよいよ**, **一方だ** focuses solely on the continuous progression of a situation, without
      necessarily implying a final stage or climax. For example, 「物価は上がる一方だ」 (Prices keep going up) describes
      a continuous trend.
  - term: とうとう
    meaning: Finally, At last
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to **いよいよ** in its "finally" meaning, **とうとう** often carries a sense of inevitability
      or resignation, sometimes after a period of difficulty or struggle. It can also imply a result that
      was expected, even if undesirable. For example, 「とうとう壊れてしまった」 (It finally broke).
  - term: 遂に
    meaning: Finally, At last
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Like **とうとう**, **遂に** also means "finally" or "at last," but it often emphasizes the achievement
      of something after overcoming obstacles or putting in significant effort. It carries a stronger
      sense of accomplishment than **いよいよ**. For example, 「遂に夢が叶った」 (My dream finally came true).
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **いよいよ** often highlights the anticipation
  or building momentum leading up to an event or a state. **一方だ** emphasizes continuous progression, **とうとう**
  suggests inevitability (sometimes negative), and **遂に** stresses achievement after effort.
