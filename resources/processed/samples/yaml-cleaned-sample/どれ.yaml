  **どれ** is part of the こそあど family of words, along with **これ** (this), **それ** (that), and **あれ** (that over there). These words are essential for pointing out or asking about things. However, unlike これ, それ, and あれ, which refer to specific items, words starting with **ど** are used for inquiry.

  Think of **どれ** as the "which one?" of a group of three or more. It helps you ask for clarification when you have multiple options.

  It's interesting to note that the particle **が** often comes after **どれ**, especially at the beginning of questions, like 「どれがいいですか。」(Which is good?). However, when **どれ** comes *after* a noun, the particle **は** is used.

  A common point of confusion is when to use **どれ** versus **どちら** or **どっち**. While originally these words might have had slightly different nuances, in modern Japanese, the general rule is: use **どちら** (more formal) or **どっち** (more casual) when there are only **two** options. If there are three or more, you'll use **どれ**.

post_example_writeup: Notice how 「どれ」 is often followed by the particle 「が」 when it's the subject of the
  sentence or when asking a question directly about which item is being referred to. When 「どれ」 follows
  a noun, like in 「この中でどれが…」, the particle 「の」 is often used to connect them.

      or previously mentioned.

  - term: どの
    meaning: Which (of three or more), What (kind)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「どれ」 which stands alone as a pronoun, 「どの」 acts as a determiner and must be followed
      by a noun (e.g., どの本 - which book).
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「どれ」 and the other こそあど words, remember that 「どれ」 is specifically
  for asking 'which one?' out of multiple options. The key difference between 「どれ」 and 「どの」 is that 「どれ」
  is a pronoun and stands alone, while 「どの」 is an adnominal adjective (連体詞) and needs to be followed by
  a noun.
