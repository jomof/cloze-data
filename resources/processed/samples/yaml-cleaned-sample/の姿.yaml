  When the noun 姿 ("figure") is used as a suffix, it describes the outward appearance of someone. This may relate to what the person is wearing, their overall shape, body type, or style. 姿 is often translated as "(A) looking", "wearing (A)", "clad in (A)", or "performing (A)". 姿 focuses primarily on how someone appears to an observer. Therefore, it's also often used to describe the observer's impression of who they are looking at, regarding their presence or absence.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  姿 can follow verbs in their attributive form (辞書形). For example, 「働く姿」 (the figure of someone working).
  *  It can also follow nouns, usually with the particle の. For example, 「花嫁の姿」 (the figure of a bride).
  *  After kanji compounds, the の is sometimes omitted, but this is not always the case. Generally, の may be dropped after kanji compounds but not after simple words like 人, 時, 元, etc.
