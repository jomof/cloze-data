  あれ, just like これ and それ, is one of several "pronoun-like" words in Japanese (substitute nouns). あれ translates roughly to "that" in English. However, unlike それ, あれ is used to highlight things that are away from **both** the speaker and the listener. Due to this, it is also often translated as "that over there".

  **Caution:** Be careful not to mix up あれ with the common spoken expression あれ, which means "huh?" or "oh?". These are not the same words. The difference will usually be clear from context within a sentence, and the way the word is said. あれ as "huh?" has a rising tone and sounds like a question.
examples:
  - japanese: あれは何?
    english: What is that over there?
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「何」 and the question mark indicates a casual and direct inquiry.
  - japanese: あれはコンビニです。
    english: That over there is a convenience store.
    register: standard
    setting: informative
    nuance: The polite 「です」 makes this a standard, informative statement.
  - japanese: あれは素敵なカフェですね。今度一緒に行きませんか?
    english: That's a lovely cafe over there, isn't it? Would you like to go together sometime?
    register: polite
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「素敵ですね」 is a polite way to compliment, and 「行きませんか」 is a soft invitation, suitable for a first
      date. The speaker's gender is implied by the context of initiating a date.
  - japanese: あれ、君の新しい車?かっこいいね！
    english: Oh, is that your new car? It's cool!
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The initial 「あれ」 indicates surprise or noticing something. 「かっこいいね！」 is a casual way for a
      male to compliment another male on something cool.
    etymology: The initial 「あれ」 here is the interjection meaning 'oh' or 'huh?', distinct from the pronoun.
  - japanese: ねえ、あそこの赤い花、あれすごく綺麗じゃない?君みたいだ。
    english: Hey, that red flower over there, isn't it really beautiful? Just like you.
    register: shitashii kuchō
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「ねえ」 is an intimate way to start a conversation. Comparing the flower to the listener 「君みたいだ」
      is a direct and flirty compliment.
    etymology: 「みたいだ」 literally means 'like', used here to draw a comparison.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion with similar words, remember that あれ refers to something
  distant from both the speaker and the listener. Words like これ and そこ indicate proximity to either the
  speaker or the listener. Additionally, be mindful of the distinction between the pronoun あれ and the
  interjection あれ, which depends on context and intonation.
