writeup: '**また** (written as 又 in kanji) functions as a conjunction meaning "again", "additionally", "also",
  or "moreover". It signifies a repetition or addition of something. Think of it as a way to say that
  the same action is happening again, or a different but related action is also happening. It can introduce
  a sentence or phrase that adds to a previous statement. Essentially, **また** indicates a recurrence or
  the presence of something extra. When something happens **また**, it can be the same thing happening once
  more ("again"), or something else happening in addition to the first thing ("also", "moreover").'

      intimate.
false_friends:
  - term: 再び
    meaning: Again, Once more, A second time
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **また**, 「再び」 emphasizes the repetition of the exact same action. It focuses more on
      the 're-doing' aspect.
  - term: 更に
    meaning: Even more or further, Again, More and more
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While **また** can mean 'moreover', 「更に」 emphasizes an increase in degree or extent. It suggests
      something is becoming more or greater.
  - term: 上に
    meaning: As well, Besides, In addition to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to **また**'s meaning of 'also', 「上に」 explicitly adds another point, often implying
      a sense of building upon the previous statement. It feels slightly more formal than **また** in some
      contexts.
  - term: それに
    meaning: And, Besides, Moreover, In addition
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Like **また**, 「それに」 adds information, but it often feels like a stronger addition, more like
      'furthermore' or 'in addition to that'. It connects ideas more directly than **また** sometimes does.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing **また** with these similar expressions, remember that **また**
  is a versatile word that can mean both 'again' (referring to the same action) and 'also/moreover' (referring
  to a different but related action or piece of information). 「再び」 focuses solely on the repetition of
  the *same* action. 「更に」 implies an increase or something *more* than before. 「上に」 and 「それに」 are stronger
  ways to *add* information, often feeling more emphatic than **また** when used in that sense.
