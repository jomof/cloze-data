  **なんか** is a Japanese expression often used with the adverbial particle **など**. They share similar meanings in many situations, and **なんか** itself can be considered an adverbial particle. **なんて** is an extension of this, potentially an abbreviation of **などという**, meaning "to say something like".

  Both **なんか** and **なんて** function similarly to **など**, translating to English as "such as" or "things like". A key difference lies in usage: **なんて** is more common after **用言** (conjugatable words like verbs, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives), while **なんか** is primarily used after **体言** (unconjugatable words, i.e., nouns). However, native speakers often use either **なんか** or **なんて** regardless of the word type without considering it incorrect.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Both **なんか** and **なんて** can convey a low evaluation of the preceding word. This can express humility when referring to oneself or be insulting when directed at others.
  *  Despite this nuance, many native speakers use **なんか** and **なんて** simply as filler words in casual conversation.
