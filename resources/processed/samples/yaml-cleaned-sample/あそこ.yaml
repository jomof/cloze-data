writeup: |-
  Like 「ここ」 and 「そこ」, 「あそこ」 is a word used to identify a place in Japanese. It refers to a location distant from both the speaker and the listener. In English, it translates roughly to "that place over there." 「あそこ」 can refer to both physical and emotional locations.

  Similar to how 「あれ」 can refer back to something previously mentioned, 「あそこ」 can refer back to a previously mentioned place. However, unlike 「それ」 or 「そこ」, 「あれ」 and 「あそこ」 are used this way only when both the speaker and listener have intimate knowledge of the topic.

  **Important Considerations:**

  「あそこ」 should not be confused with 「あっち」, a similar word that is also sometimes translated as "over there." 「あっち」 focuses more on the direction one is/is going, while 「あそこ」 focuses purely on "that place."
