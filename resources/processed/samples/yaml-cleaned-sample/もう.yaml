  **\u3082\u3046** is a versatile word often translated as "already" in positive contexts and "anymore" in negative contexts. This is because its core meaning revolves around something reaching an unexpected conclusion.

  Consider these interpretations:

  *  **(Past/Positive):** Something that wasn't expected to be finished is now done. This leads to the translation "already".
  *  **(Negative):** Something that was expected to continue has stopped. This results in the translation "anymore".

  This is the opposite of **まだ** (mada), which signifies that something is unexpectedly still in progress.

  **\u3082\u3046** can also be used in questions to confirm if something might have ended, reflecting a speaker's anticipation of that ending.

  Beyond its core meanings, **\u3082\u3046** is frequently used to express frustration or resignation, indicating that one has reached their limit and doesn't want to continue further.

post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in the examples, the nuance of **\u3082\u3046** shifts depending
  on the sentence's context. In positive sentences, like "\u3082\u3046\u5e30\u3063\u305f" (They've already
  gone home), it highlights the completion of an action. Conversely, in negative sentences, such as "\u3082\u3046\u6泣\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3067"
  (Don't cry anymore), it signifies the cessation of an ongoing state. The question form, as in "\u3082\u3046\u5b66\u6821\u306b\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304b",
  expresses an inquiry about a potential completion.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both **\u3082\u3046** and **すでに** (sude ni) can translate to "already",
  **すでに** often carries a stronger sense of "too late" or "it's a done deal". **まだ** (mada), on the other
  hand, expresses the opposite of **\u3082\u3046**. When **\u3082\u3046** signifies that something has
  ended, **まだ** indicates that it is still ongoing or hasn't happened yet. To avoid confusion, consider
  the expected state of the action or situation. If the focus is on the unexpected completion or cessation,
  **\u3082\u3046** is appropriate. If the emphasis is on the continuation or lack of completion, use **まだ**.
  If there's a nuance of something being a foregone conclusion, **すでに** might be a better fit.
