  In our first らしい lesson, we discussed the auxiliary verb use of らしい. In this lesson we will focus on the 形容詞の一部 (auxiliary adjective) usage. An auxiliary adjective is a type of adjective that must be attached to another word for it to have any meaning. To use らしい in this way, it must be attached to the end of a noun, and will imply that something is "typical of (A)", where (A) is the noun that comes before it. As this らしい behaves like an い-Adjective, it may also be conjugated to らしく, before a (B) phrase will explain more about 'what' is/was typical of (A). The primary use of this らしい is to express that (A) has some feature or trait that is expected of itself. It can be used for people, "studying all night is so typical of Tanaka", or it can be used for things like seasons "this heat is so typical of the Japanese Summer". Other common translations are "to be befitting of (A)", or "to be appropriate for (A)". However, it may also be used negatively, to show that something is (often surprisingly) "uncharacteristic of (A)".

  **Fun Fact:** When the noun that appears in (A) and (B) are the same, it will imply that (A) is the "prime example of (B)", or "the most (A), (B)".

false_friends:
  - term: っぽい
    meaning: -ish, -like, Characteristic of, Typical of, Tendency to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both 「らしい」 and 「っぽい」 can mean '-ish' or 'like', 「っぽい」 often implies a superficial resemblance
      or a strong tendency, whereas 「らしい」 suggests a more inherent or expected characteristic. For example,
      「子供っぽい」 means 'childish' in a way that seems immature, but 「子供らしい」 means 'childlike' in a way that
      is natural and expected of a child.
  - term: らしい ①
    meaning: Seems like, Apparently, I heard
    kind: homonym
    nuance: This is the auxiliary verb use of 「らしい」, which expresses hearsay or indirect information.
      It translates to 'it seems like' or 'I heard that'. It's different from the adjectival 「らしい」 which
      describes something as typical or befitting.
  - term: みたいに・みたいな
    meaning: Like, Similar to, Resembling
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「みたいに」 and 「みたいな」 are used to express similarity or resemblance. They are more about outward
      appearances or comparisons. 「らしい」 focuses more on inherent characteristics or what is typical or
      befitting.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「らしい ②」 with similar expressions, remember that 「らしい」 (as
  an auxiliary adjective) emphasizes what is inherently typical, befitting, or characteristic of something.
  「っぽい」 suggests a strong resemblance or tendency, 「らしい ①」 (as an auxiliary verb) indicates hearsay, and
  「みたいに/みたいな」 focuses on similarity or resemblance.
