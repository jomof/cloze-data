  When a speaker is making a determination about something in Japanese, the adverb **むしろ** is often used to express a more accurate depiction of what has already been said. This is regularly translated as "rather", or "instead". **むしろ** will mostly appear at the beginning of new sentences, or the beginning of a second clause within a sentence, before information about (A) will be clarified.

  As **むしろ** seeks to give a more accurate description about something, it will often be paired with grammar patterns such as **より**, to show where the comparison is being made.

  **Fun Fact:** **むしろ** comes from the kanji 寧ろ, literally meaning "preferable". This is the same kanji that appears in the word 丁寧, meaning "polite" (sometimes also translated as "careful"). The grammar structure **むしろ** itself may even be translated as "preferably", simply expressing that careful consideration has been given to describing something accurately.
