writeup: The suffix ～代 is used for several different things. One of the most common uses is for highlighting
  someone's decade of age. Similar to how English uses "teens," "twenties," and "thirties." To use this,
  simply add 代 after the age (in tens) in Japanese. In addition to someone's decade of age, ～代 can be
  used to express a chronological decade, such as the 1960s, 70s, or 80s. In these cases, 年代 will often
  be used after the decade. It's interesting to note that 代 is also regularly used when marking eras of
  time or generations of people within a specific family or political position.
