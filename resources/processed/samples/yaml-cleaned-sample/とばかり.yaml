writeup: |-
  とばかり is a construction often used to indicate that something is being done **as if to say** a particular thought or feeling, or **seeming that** something is the case. It combines the case-marking particle と, used here for quotation, and the adverbial particle ばかり, which emphasizes that something is very much as described. Therefore, とばかり implies that while something strongly suggests a certain interpretation, it's not explicitly stated.

  とばかり can follow almost any word because the と acts as a quoting mechanism. The particle に frequently follows ばかり when the sentence continues to describe the actual situation or the consequence of the implied meaning.

  とばかりに is a shortened form of と言わんばかりに, which means "to only just not be at the point where (A) is said." The longer form, と言わんばかりに, is also quite common. 言わん is a contraction of 言わぬ, employing the classical auxiliary verb ぬ for negation.

  **Important Consideration:**
  Because とばかりに describes how something "looks like it's about to say" something, it's generally not used to describe the speaker's own actions or thoughts. However, it might appear when referring to the speaker in the third person.
