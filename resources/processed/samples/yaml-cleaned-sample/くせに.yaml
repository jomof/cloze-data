writeup: |-
  **くせに** (usually written without kanji) expresses a feeling of reproach, blame, or dissatisfaction towards someone's actions or a situation, considering their capabilities, status, or a previous statement. It's similar to saying "despite," "even though," or "and yet" in English, but with a nuance of criticism.

  The term **くせ** itself is a noun meaning "habit" or "tendency," often with a negative connotation, like a "vice." The addition of the case-marking particle **に** creates this adversative conjunction.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Criticism:** くせに always carries a negative feeling or judgment. It's used when the speaker feels that something is not as it should be.
  *  **Contrast:** It highlights a contradiction or unexpected situation.
  *  **Informal:** While generally considered standard register, it's less formal than expressions like のに or にもかかわらず.
  *  **Subject usually someone else:** While you can use it about yourself, it's more common when talking about others.
  *  **Origin of くせ:** Originally, くせ indicated a preference or inclination. Over time, it developed a negative connotation. Thus, くせに highlights a discrepancy between an expected positive attribute or situation and a less desirable outcome or behavior.
