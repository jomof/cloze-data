  使用域: 一般
writeup: Like として, にして highlights an aspect of something from which another thing happens. The core difference
  is that と implies that (B) results from (A), while に suggests that (B) happens or exists simultaneously
  with (A). This reflects the case-marking particle に's use as a marker of location. The adverbial particle
  は presents the entire (A) phrase as something that will be compared. にしては is generally translated as
  "considering (A), (B)" or "even for (A), (B)" and can be used with both nouns and verbs. Similar to
  として, にして is often considered a stand-alone adverbial particle, despite its composite structure. Despite
  the "considering (A), (B)" translation, にしては is semantically closer to "while (A), (B)". This conveys
  that (A) and (B) share a simultaneous relationship, but also acknowledges that (B) isn't necessarily
  a direct result of (A).

post_false_friends_writeup: While にしては shares the idea of 'considering' with other grammar points, it
  often carries a nuance of unexpectedness or a slight deviation from what might be anticipated given
  the circumstances. Be mindful of the subtle differences in emphasis when choosing between these similar
  expressions. For instance, 割に highlights the surprising aspect more strongly, while としては focuses more
  on the role or category. に比べて is a more straightforward comparison without the same sense of unexpectedness.
