  The grammar point 「ていく」 combines the て-form of a verb with the verb 「いく」(to go). The core meaning is that an action happens and then moves away, either literally in space or figuratively in time. Think of it as an action 'going on' or 'progressing'.

  **Key Nuances:**

  *  **Spatial Movement:** Often describes someone or something moving away after performing an action. The kanji for 「行く」 (行) is likely to be used in this context.
  *  **Temporal Progression:** Indicates that an action starts and continues into the future. This can also imply a gradual change or development over time. Hiragana for 「いく」 (いく) is more common here, though not a strict rule.
  *  **Starting an Action:** Can express the beginning of a new action or state that will continue. This is similar to "to start ~ing."

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  「ていく」 focuses on the progression and continuation of an action away from the speaker or a present point in time.
  *  Its counterpart, 「てくる」, emphasizes the arrival or culmination of an action towards the speaker or the present.
  *  The tense of 「いく」 determines whether the action is happening now/in the future (ていく/ていきます) or happened in the past (ていった/ていきました).

false_friends:
  - term: へいく
    meaning: To go to, To head toward
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ていく」, 「へいく」 simply indicates direction or destination. It doesn't imply the continuation
      of a previous action.
  - term: Verb + にいく
    meaning: To go to do, To go in order to ~
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar, 「Verb + にいく」 focuses on the purpose of going somewhere. 「ていく」 emphasizes the
      continuation of an action.
  - term: はじめる
    meaning: To start, To begin to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「はじめる」 specifically means 'to start' something. While 「ていく」 can imply starting, it also encompasses
      the idea of continuing or moving away after an action.
  - term: てくる
    meaning: To come to, To become, To continue, To be starting to, Has been ~ing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「てくる」 is the opposite of 「ていく」. It indicates movement towards the speaker or the present,
      or the culmination of an action.
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse 「ていく」 with similar expressions. 「へいく」 is about destination,
  「Verb + にいく」 is about purpose, 「はじめる」 is about initiation, and 「てくる」 is about coming towards or reaching
  a state.
