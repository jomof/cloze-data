etymology: The particle で is thought to have originated as a contraction of にて.
writeup: で is a particle that has several different uses in Japanese. In the context of indicating location,
  it marks the **place where an action occurs**. Think of it as saying the action *happens at* this location.
  This is different from the particle に, which often indicates a destination or a point in time. Essentially,
  で highlights that the place is **essential** or **required** for the action to take place. For example,
  if you say 「公園でピクニックをします」 (I will have a picnic at the park), the park is where the picnicking activity
  will happen.
examples:
  - japanese: 私はここでサッカーをする。
    english: I play soccer here.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「ここ」 is a basic word for 'here'. The sentence is straightforward and conveys information.
  - japanese: そこで待ち合わせするのはどう?
    english: How about we meet up there?
    register: casual
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「待ち合わせする」 means 'to meet up'. The phrase 「どう?」 is a casual way to suggest or ask an opinion,
      suitable for a first-date setting.
    etymology: 「待ち合わせ」 combines the verb 「待つ」(to wait) and 「合わせる」(to combine/bring together).
  - japanese: 教室で寝るのは良くないですよ。
    english: Sleeping in the classroom is not good, you know.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_age: older
    listener_age: younger
    nuance: 「良くないですよ」 is a gentle way of saying something is not good. The 「よ」 adds a touch of emphasis,
      often used by someone in a slightly superior or advising position.
    etymology: 「教室」 literally means 'teaching room'.
  - japanese: 今夜、うちで映画を見ない?
    english: Wanna watch a movie at my place tonight?
    register: shitashii kuchō
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「うち」 is a casual way to say 'my place'. 「見ない?」 is an informal and inviting way to ask 'Don't
      you want to watch?'. This kind of phrasing, omitting the subject and using a negative question,
      is common in intimate settings.
  - japanese: 会議は３階の会議室で行われます。
    english: The meeting will be held in the conference room on the third floor.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「行われます」 is the passive form of 「行う」 (to hold/conduct), making the sentence sound more formal
      and objective, appropriate for a professional setting.
    etymology: 「会議室」 literally means 'meeting room'.
post_example_writeup: Remember that the key function of で in this context is to specify the location where
  the action takes place. It highlights the place as the setting for the activity.
false_friends:
  - term: に
    meaning: In, At, To, For, On
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike で, に often indicates a destination or a point in time. For example, 「学校に行く」 (go to
      school) uses に because the school is the destination.
  - term: にて
    meaning: In, At, With, Using, By
    kind: synonym
    nuance: にて is a more formal version of で. While both can indicate location, にて is more common in written
      or very formal speech.
  - term: で (at)
    meaning: With, By (using)
    kind: homonym
    nuance: This is the same particle で but with a different meaning, indicating the means or method of
      doing something, for example, 「車で行く」 (go by car).
  - term: において・における
    meaning: In, On, At, Regarding, In terms of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: において and における are much more formal ways of saying 'in' or 'at', often used in academic or
      official contexts. They carry a stronger sense of 'in the context of'.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, focus on the nuance of で highlighting the place where
  an action *occurs*. While に might indicate the location of existence or a destination, で specifies the
  setting of the action. にて is simply a more formal alternative to で. Be mindful of the other meaning
  of で, which indicates means or method. Finally, において and における are significantly more formal and indicate
  'in the context of' rather than simply 'at' or 'in'.
