grammar_point: なん + counter + か
jlpt: N4
meaning: Some, Several, A few
details:
  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
etymology: 「なん」 is the informal reading of the kanji 何, meaning "what". 「か」 is a particle indicating uncertainty
  or a question (though not a direct question in this context). So, literally it suggests an unknown quantity.
writeup: |-
  はい、皆さん！ Today we're learning about how to say "some" or "a few" when counting things. We use the pattern **なん + counter + か**. Think of it like saying you have "what-number-I-wonder" of something. It shows you're not sure of the exact number, but it's definitely more than one!

  For example, if you have a few books, you could say 「何冊か」 (nan-satsu-ka). The **counter** changes depending on what you're counting - remember to use the correct counter for things like people (人 - nin), books (冊 - satsu), times (回 - kai), etc.

  You might also see **いく + counter + か**. いく uses the kanji 幾, which also means "how many/much". Both なん and いく are used, but なん is generally more common when you're counting specific items. いく is often found in set phrases like 「幾ら」 (ikura - how much) or 「幾つ」 (ikutsu - how many/old).

  **Important Consideration:** Be careful! The kanji 何 can also be read as 「なに」. When you see 「なに」, it's usually asking "what is it?" or identifying something, not counting. So, when counting, remember it's almost always 「なん」.

post_example_writeup: Remember that the choice between using 「なん」 or 「いく」 with the counter often depends
  on the specific counter and context. While both indicate an indefinite small quantity, 「いく」 is more
  often used in broader questions about quantity or value.
