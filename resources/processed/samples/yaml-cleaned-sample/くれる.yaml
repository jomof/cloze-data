writeup: |-
  くれる is generally taught as part of a set of 3 verbs that are regularly used for giving and receiving in Japanese: くれる, あげる, and もらう. くれる means "to give" to you, or someone that is part of your '**in**' group. With くれる and あげる, both function as expected regarding particles: が always marks the giver (the person performing the action), and に marks the recipient (the person who is the 'destination' of the thing given). を is used to mark the 'object' that is given, as usual.

  The giver and/or recipient are often omitted from sentences with くれる, as one or both are usually obvious from context, or the sentence might focus on the object. The nuance remains even when elements are omitted.

  **Fun Fact:** What someone considers their 'in' group varies but usually includes family members, club members, or similar groups you're part of.

  **Caution:** To say that you (or someone else) gave something to someone **not** in your 'in' group, use あげる instead.

false_friends:
  - term: もらう
    meaning: To receive, To get, To obtain
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike くれる, もらう focuses on receiving something, and the subject is the receiver. The giver
      is marked with に or から.
  - term: あげる
    meaning: To give (away), To present, To provide
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike くれる, あげる is used when the speaker or someone in their 'in-group' gives something to
      someone outside that group.
  - term: てくれる
    meaning: To do something for someone (usually you)
    kind: grammatical structure
    nuance: Unlike くれる which is about giving a physical object, てくれる describes someone doing an action
      as a favor for you or someone in your 'in-group'.
  - term: てくれてありがとう
    meaning: Thank you for ~ ing
    kind: grammatical structure
    nuance: Unlike くれる, which is the act of giving, てくれてありがとう is an expression of gratitude for a favor
      done.
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse くれる with other verbs of giving and receiving. The
  key difference with くれる lies in the direction of giving—from outside to inside the speaker's social
  circle. When thanking someone for doing something, use the ～てくれて form.
