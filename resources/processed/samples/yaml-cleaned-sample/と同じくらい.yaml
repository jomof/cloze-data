  「と同じぐらい」 is a combination of the case-marking particle 「と」, the noun 「同じ」 meaning "the same", and the adverbial particle 「くらい」 (also written as 「ぐらい」) which indicates an approximate amount or degree. Together, 「と同じくらい」 is used to express that something is **roughly equivalent** or **comparable** to something else.

  To use 「と同じくらい」, attach it to a noun that serves as the **point of comparison**. The item being compared to the reference point usually comes after 「と同じくらい」, often connected with the particle 「の」 or 「に」.

  *  When comparing nouns directly, use 「A**と**同じくらいのB」 or 「BはA**と**同じくらいだ」.
  *  When comparing actions or states, you can use 「A**と**同じくらい**に** + verb/adjective」 to indicate that something is done or experienced in a similar way or to a similar extent.

  It's a versatile expression for indicating similarity in size, quantity, intensity, or any other measurable quality.
