  To describe what something or some place is famous for, the common expression **～は～で有名** is used. This structure consists of the topic particle **は**, the particle **で** indicating reason or means, and **有名 (ゆうめい)**, a *na*-adjective meaning "famous" or "well-known."

  The basic translation of **～は～で有名** is "(A) is famous for (B)." Literally, it can be understood as "With (B), (A) is famous/renowned." The structure can be broken down as follows:

  *  **(A) は**: Indicates that (A) is the topic of the sentence.
  *  **(B) で**: Here, **で** signifies the reason or cause for the fame, similar to its use meaning "with" or "because of."
  *  **有名だ**: Means "is famous."

  It's common to see **こと** (or **の**) preceding **で有名** when the famous aspect is an entire phrase rather than a single noun. This emphasizes the action or state that (A) is known for.

  **Important Consideration:**

  If **有名** is used as a *na*-adjective modifying a noun, it comes directly before the noun it describes. For example, you would say 「有名な観光地 (ゆうめいなかんこうち - famous tourist spot)」. The grammar point **～は～で有名** focuses on *why* something is famous, while the *na*-adjective form describes something that *is* famous.
