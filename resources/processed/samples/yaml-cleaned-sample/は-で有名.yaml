  To express what something or someplace is famous for, the pattern **XはYで有名** is commonly used. This structure indicates that X is renowned due to Y.

  Let's break down the components:

  *  **X は**: Marks X as the topic of the sentence.
  *  **Y で**: Indicates the reason or characteristic for which X is famous. The particle で functions here to mean "because of" or "due to".
  *  **有名 (yūmei)**: Means "famous" or "well-known". It can function as both a noun and a な-adjective.

  Sometimes, you might see **こと** or **の** placed before で有名. This often occurs when Y is a phrase or clause rather than a single noun, specifying the action or state that X is famous for.

  **Caution:** When 有名 is used as a な-adjective, it directly precedes the noun it modifies, like in the example "有名な観光地" (a famous tourist spot). This emphasizes the fame of the noun itself.

  - grammar_point: ～として知られている
    nuance: Emphasizes wider recognition or establishment of a fact.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both ～は～で有名 and ～として知られている express that something is known, they have
  slightly different nuances. ～は～で有名 focuses on the specific reason **why** something is famous. On the
  other hand, ～として知られている emphasizes the general fact of something being known or recognized, often in
  a broader or more established context. You might use ～として知られている when stating a well-known fact or when
  the reason for the fame isn't the primary focus.
