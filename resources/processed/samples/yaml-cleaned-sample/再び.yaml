  **再び (futatabi)** is an adverb that signifies repetition, translating to "again", "once more", or "a second time". It typically appears at the beginning of a sentence, preceding a statement or request about something that is being repeated. A key nuance of **再び** is that it implies something is happening for the **second time**. Therefore, it's generally not used for actions that need to be repeated multiple times.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Formality:** Unlike **また (mata)**, which commonly means "again", **再び** is considerably more formal. You'll encounter it more often in written materials like books and articles rather than in everyday conversation.
  *  **Second Time:** Remember that **再び** strongly implies a second occurrence. Avoid using it when referring to something happening for the third time or more.

  **Caution:** While both **再び** and **また** can mean "again", **再び** carries a stronger sense of formality and specifically refers to a second occurrence.

post_example_writeup: While 「再び」 literally means 'again', its nuance of 'for the second time' is important
  to remember. It's not appropriate for situations where something is repeated many times. Also, be mindful
  of its formality; in everyday conversation, 「また」 is generally more suitable.
