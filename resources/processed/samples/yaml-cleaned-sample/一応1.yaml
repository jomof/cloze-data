  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
writeup: The adverb 一応 (ichioo) conveys the idea of doing something as a precaution, just to be safe,
  or to meet the minimum requirement. It suggests that while something might not be strictly necessary,
  it's a good idea to do it to prevent a potential issue. Think of it as covering your bases. It implies
  that the speaker believes the negative outcome is unlikely, but the action is a sensible precaution.
  While 一応 can also mean "more or less" or "for the time being," this particular usage emphasizes the
  "just in case" aspect.

false_friends:
  - term: 一応 ②
    meaning: more or less, for the time being, tentatively・roughly
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 一応 ① which emphasizes "just in case," 一応 ② indicates an approximate state or a temporary
      measure. It suggests something is not yet finalized or perfect.
  - term: 万が一
    meaning: Just in case, In the worst-case scenario, In the unlikely event, By any chance
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both 一応 ① and 万が一 translate to "just in case," 万が一 emphasizes a rarer or more serious
      potential event. 一応 ① is used for more general, everyday precautions.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 一応 has two main meanings. When you want
  to express a precautionary measure against a generally possible (though perhaps unlikely) situation,
  use 一応 ①. When you want to express something that is approximate or temporary, or when talking about
  a truly unlikely or worst-case scenario, use 一応 ② or 万が一 respectively.
