  The adverbial particle まで is used similarly to other adverbial particles, highlighting the importance of the statement that follows. Unlike the "until" usage of まで, this form carries the nuance of **"even"** or **"to the extent of"**. It can follow both verbs and nouns.

  While the "even" meaning of まで might seem distinct from "until," they share a common core concept. まで always implies a structure of **'(A)まで, (B)'**, where (A) represents the **limit or extent**, and (B) is the **noteworthy factor**. This noteworthy factor is typically a descriptive element like a verb, adjective, or explanation.

  **Fun Fact:** The particle も is often used with まで, creating the meaning of **"even"**. This combination emphasizes the surprising nature of the event or the satisfying outcome.

post_example_writeup: It's important to recognize that the "until" and "even" meanings of まで are fundamentally
  about defining a limit or extent. Context usually makes the intended meaning clear. When used with verbs,
  it often indicates a point in time or a stage in a process. When used with nouns, it frequently highlights
  something unexpected or surprising.

    kind: synonym
    nuance: くらい emphasizes the degree or level of something, often used to indicate a rough estimate or

      or approximate nature of the situation.
  - term: ほど～ない
    meaning: Is not as…as, Isn't... like..., Not to the extent of...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: This is the negative form of ほど and is used for comparisons, stating that something doesn't
      reach a certain degree or extent. It's used for comparing levels or quantities, unlike the "even"
      meaning of まで.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that まで as "even" highlights something unexpected
  or surprising within a given situation. The other uses of まで focus on temporal or spatial boundaries.
  Expressions like ほど and くらい, while sometimes similar in meaning, often involve comparisons or estimations
  of degree, whereas まで in its "even" form emphasizes the inclusion of something unexpected or extreme.
