  The non-past form of Japanese verbs is the same as the dictionary form. Unlike English, this single form can express several meanings. It can describe:

  *  **General truths** or facts.
  *  **Habits** or regularly occurring actions.
  *  **Future events**.

  In English, these meanings often require different verb conjugations (e.g., "eats", "will eat", "eat"). Because the non-past form covers multiple tenses and aspects, time expressions are often used in the sentence to clarify the intended meaning. If no time expression is present, the sentence usually expresses a general truth that is true at any time.

  In narrative contexts like books, the non-past form can also describe actions happening "in the moment". The context usually makes this meaning clear.

  - japanese: 私は９時にバナナを食べる。
    english: I will eat a banana at 9 o'clock.
  - japanese: ヴァンパイアは血を飲む。
    english: Vampires drink blood.
