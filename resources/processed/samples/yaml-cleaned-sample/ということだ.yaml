writeup: |-
  Similar to ということ, an expression used for nominalizing a phrase like "the ~ that ~," **ということだ** utilizes the auxiliary verb だ (or です) to emphasize that the nominalized phrase "is" the case. This phrase is often translated as "I heard that" or "it is said that," but literally, it's closer to "it is that it's ~." The だ lends a sense of certainty, implying the speaker has heard the statement elsewhere and believes it to be valid.

  **Key Usage Points:**

  *  **Reporting Information:** **ということだ** is used to relay information heard from another source. It can be added to the end of any phrase the speaker wants to highlight as known information.
  *  **Source Markers:** It frequently appears with expressions indicating the source of information, such as によると or によれば.
  *  **Hearsay vs. Fact:** When used for hearsay (unproven statements), it can be rephrased as とのことだ. The subtle difference is:
  *  **ということだ:** Emphasizes the information itself ("It can be explained that (A) is ~").
  *  **とのことだ:** Emphasizes the source of the information ("The statement of (A) has been applied to ~").

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Formality:** **ということだ** is generally considered more formal than そうだ when reporting information, as it suggests a higher degree of certainty.

    meaning: ~ing, The ~ that ~ (Nominalization)

  - term: そうだ
    meaning: I heard that, It is said that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Both express hearsay, but 「ということだ」 generally carries a slightly more formal tone and implies
      a higher degree of certainty compared to 「そうだ」.
  - term: らしい ①
    meaning: Seems like, Apparently, I heard
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「らしい」 expresses a more subjective sense of hearing something or making a judgment based on
      indirect evidence, whereas 「ということだ」 is more directly reporting information heard.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「ということだ」 with similar expressions, remember that 「ということだ」
  specifically emphasizes the act of relaying information that has been heard, often with a sense of certainty.
  Expressions like 「そうだ」 and 「らしい」 can also convey hearsay but have slightly different nuances in terms
  of formality and the speaker's level of certainty. 「ことなの」 often seeks confirmation, 「だって」 has broader
  uses, and 「とか」 implies uncertainty or listing. Focusing on the direct reporting aspect will help distinguish
  「ということだ」.
