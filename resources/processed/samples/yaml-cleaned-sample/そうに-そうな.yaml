writeup: |-
  そうだ is one of the 18 auxiliary verbs in Japanese and behaves similarly to な-adjectives. It can be followed by な when acting as an adjective (連体形) or に when acting as an adverb (連用形). This characteristic is shared with ようだ but not all auxiliary verbs. Both そうに and ような convey the meaning of "seeming like (A)" or "looking like (A)".

  **Important Consideration:** Be cautious when attaching そう to the negative forms of い-adjectives (ない). There's a specific conjugation rule: remove the final い from ない and insert さ before adding そう, resulting in なさそう. This insertion of さ does **not** occur with negative verbs. This difference arises because the ない used with negative verbs is an auxiliary verb, not an い-adjective. For negative verbs, simply remove the い from ない and add そう directly to the verb stem.
