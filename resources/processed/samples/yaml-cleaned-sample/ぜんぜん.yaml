writeup: はい、皆さん！ Let's talk about 全然 (ぜんぜん). This is a super useful word that means "not at all" when
  used with negative verb endings like ない or ません。 Think of it as emphasizing the "not." For example, if
  you say 全然知らない (ぜんぜんしらない), it means "I don't know at all." You can write it as 全然 in kanji, or just
  ぜんぜん in hiragana - both are common. It's more casual and friendly than 全く (まったく), which also means "not
  at all" but can sound a bit more formal or even negative depending on the context and tone. Imagine
  someone asks if you're upset, and you say 「全く！」 - it can sound like you're really not happy! However,
  全然 has become really popular, especially with younger people, to mean "totally" or "completely" even
  with positive sentences. So, someone might say 全然大丈夫 (ぜんぜんだいじょうぶ) to mean "I'm totally fine!" While
  some might say this isn't grammatically correct in the strictest sense, it's so common now that most
  people accept it. Just be aware of the nuance!

  it with positive meanings might be more acceptable with friends than with your boss! Also, pay attention
  to the tone of voice when someone uses 全く. It can really change the feeling of the sentence.

  - term: とても～ない
    meaning: Not ~ at all, Cannot ~ at all
    kind: synonym

      of 'totally' with positive statements.

    meaning: Not even a little, Not at all, Not in the least, Never
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 全然, 「少しも～ない」 focuses on a small degree or amount and doesn't have the recent usage

  - term: 全く～ない
    meaning: Not~at all
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to 全然 in its negative usage, 「全く～ない」 generally has a more formal or stronger
      negative nuance and doesn't usually mean 'totally' in positive sentences.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 全然 with these similar expressions, remember that 全然 is
  becoming increasingly common with positive meanings to mean 'totally.' 「とても～ない」 and 「少しも～ない」 are generally
  used only in negative contexts. 「全く～ない」 is similar to 全然 in negative sentences but often carries a slightly
  more formal or negative feeling and is less likely to be used in positive sentences to mean 'totally'.
