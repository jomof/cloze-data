  までだ, and までのことだ are structures that are usually translated as "merely (B)", or "simply (B)". However, they are almost always used in somewhat hypothetical sentences, and translate much closer to "one can only but (B)". This nuance indicates a sense of resignation, or understanding on the part of the speaker that they personally have no options beyond (B).

  This grammar pattern will be used following verbs in their **dictionary form**, and will often come at the end of a sentence that uses なら in the first clause. In this way, it will mean "if (A), then (B) is all that can be done". (A) will almost always be a negative situation.

  Examining the standard meaning of the particle まで as signifying an extent, it can be seen that this meaning is kept in までだ, with the speaker expressing that (B) is the extent of what is possible given the negative circumstances brought about by (A).

      in a slightly less resigned way, framing the suggestion as a simple option, but the context and

      the invitation.

    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「もし気が向いたら」 is a polite and non-committal way to suggest an activity. 「お茶でも飲みに行くまでですが…」 uses
      「までだ」 with the trailing 「が」 and ellipsis 「…」 to create a tentative and suggestive tone, suitable
      for an early romantic context. This phrasing makes the invitation feel less forceful and gives the
      listener an easy out.

  - term: ～たまでだ
    meaning: Just, Merely, Simply, Only
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「～るまでだ」 which implies a sense of resignation or 'that's all that can be done', 「～たまでだ」
      often describes a simple action that was completed, or a state that exists as a result of a simple
      action. It doesn't necessarily carry the same nuance of limited options or resignation.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both ～るまでだ and ～たまでだ can translate to "just" or "simply", it's important
  to pay attention to the underlying nuance. ～るまでだ often appears in hypothetical situations, suggesting
  a limited course of action due to circumstances. On the other hand, ～たまでだ usually describes a completed
  action or a state resulting from a simple action, without necessarily implying a lack of other options.
