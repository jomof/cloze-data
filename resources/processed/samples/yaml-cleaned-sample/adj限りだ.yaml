writeup: '限りだ is a structure that follows **adjectives** to express an extreme degree of a feeling or
  state. It conveys the idea that something is "extremely (A)" or "as (A) as can be," where (A) is the
  adjective. This grammar pattern combines the noun 限り (kagiri), meaning "limit," with the auxiliary verb
  だ (da), or です (desu) for polite speech. The literal sense is that something is "the limit of (A)." 限りだ
  is generally considered a **formal** expression, often used in more serious or official contexts to
  emphasize the intensity of the speaker''s emotion or perception. Because it expresses the speaker''s
  feeling, the adjective used with 限りだ is typically one that describes an internal state or emotion rather
  than an objective quality. Examples include: 嬉しい (ureshii - happy), 頼もしい (tanomoshii - reliable), 羨ましい
  (urayamashii - envious), 寂しい (sabishii - lonely), 恥ずかしい (hazukashii - embarrassed), and 心強い (kokorozuyoi
  - reassuring). The strength of the emotion is subjective and reflects the speaker''s personal experience.'

      and it can be used with verbs and nouns as well as adjectives. It implies a degree of excess that
      leads to a certain outcome.

      Adj限りだ emphasizes the sheer intensity.
  - term: てたまらない
    meaning: Can't help but want to, Very, Extremely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: てたまらない often expresses an irresistible urge or desire, or a feeling that is so strong it's

post_false_friends_writeup: While あまり, てならない, and てたまらない can express strong feelings like Adj限りだ, they
  have slightly different nuances. あまり often implies a consequence of excess, てならない suggests an uncontrollable
  emotion, and てたまらない indicates a strong desire or unbearable feeling. When choosing between these, consider
  whether you want to emphasize the intensity of the feeling (限りだ), the consequence of excess (あまり), the
  uncontrollable nature of the feeling (てならない), or a strong desire or discomfort (てたまらない).
