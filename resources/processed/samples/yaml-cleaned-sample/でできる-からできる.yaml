  **でできる** and **からできる** are two grammatical structures that indicate the material something is made from. Both translate to "made of" or "made from" in English, but there are subtle nuances.

  **からできる** - This literally means "prepared from." It's often used when the original material is transformed significantly and isn't easily recognizable in the final product. It can also emphasize the initial materials before any alteration.

  **でできる** - This literally means "prepared with." It's more commonly used when the material is still recognizable or when the focus is on the materials used in the process. Modern usage tends to favor **でできる** in many situations, making the distinction less rigid.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While there's a slight difference in nuance, **でできる** and **からできる** are largely interchangeable in contemporary Japanese.
  *  There's also a subtle difference between **できる** and **できている**. **できる** is used more generally, like when talking about the nature of something (e.g., "Paper is made from wood"). **できている** is more specific, referring to a particular item (e.g., "This paper is made from wood"). However, like the で/から distinction, this is often blurred in everyday speech.

  native speakers use them to develop a more intuitive understanding.
