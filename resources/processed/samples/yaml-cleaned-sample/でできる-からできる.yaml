  「でできる」 and 「からできる」 are two grammatical structures that have very similar meanings. Essentially, they both translate to "(B) was made from/out of (A)." These constructions emphasize the 'ingredients' or 'materials' used to create something.

  **Key Differences:**

  *  **から (kara):** Literally "prepared from." It tends to be used when the original material is transformed and not immediately obvious in the final product. It can also focus on the state of the materials before any alteration. Think of it as emphasizing the *source*.
  *  **で (de):** Literally "prepared with." It's often used when the material is recognizable in the final product. It emphasizes the *means* or *method*.

  However, it's important to note that **modern Japanese speakers often use 「で」 in most situations**, regardless of whether the material is visibly apparent or not. As a result, 「でできる」 and 「からできる」 are often nearly interchangeable in contemporary language.

  **Caution regarding できる vs. できている:**

  *  **できる (dekiru):** Generally used when discussing something broadly, like "everything in category (B) is made from (A)."
  *  **できている (dekiteiru):** More frequently used when referring to a specific item, like "this particular (B) is made from (A)."

  Similar to the 「で」 and 「から」 distinction, the difference between 「できる」 and 「できている」 is subtle and they are often used interchangeably.

  of which one you choose. Focus on getting comfortable using these structures to express what something
  is made from.
