writeup: '**ならまだしも** is a combination of **なら** "if", **まだ** "still", and the adverbial particle **しも**,
  which has the primary purpose of strengthening the word that comes before it. When used, this structure
  will often be translated as "(A) is fine, but not (B)", or "(A) is fine, but it''s different when it''s
  (B)". **ならまだしも** is a phrase that usually separates the first and second half of sentences, so will
  be attached to the end of the (A) phrase, marking the statement that is acceptable. Due to the way that
  **しも** alters **まだ**, a more literal translation of this grammar point can be thought of as "if it''s
  (A), then of course there''s still that, but as for (B)".'
etymology: The particle **しも** is a classical particle that is not frequently used in modern times outside
  of set phrases or expressions like **ならまだしも**, **今しも** "right this moment", and **だれしも** "absolutely
  anybody". In all cases, it merely strengthens the word directly before it.
