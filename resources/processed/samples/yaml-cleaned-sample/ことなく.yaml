  Like ないで "without", ことなく is an expression used in Japanese following verbs that expresses (B) being done "without (A)". However, ことなく is used in more formal situations and when there is some contrast between (A) and (B). This contrast can manifest in two primary ways:

  *  **(A) is negative, and (B) is a preventative measure or an action taken while avoiding (A).** This highlights the successful avoidance of something undesirable.
  *  **(A) is something desired or expected, but (B) occurred without it being realized.** This emphasizes a lack or absence of something hoped for.

  ことなく is formed by combining こと (koto, 'thing' or 'event') and なく (naku, the adverbial form of ない, 'not'). It directly follows the dictionary form of a verb.
etymology: The grammar point 「ことなく」 is derived from the noun 「こと」 (koto), meaning 'thing' or 'event',
  followed by the adverbial form 「なく」 (naku) of the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 (nai). So literally,
  it means 'without the thing/event of doing'.

post_example_writeup: Using 「ことなく」 often implies a certain level of formality or seriousness compared
  to using 「ないで」. It's suitable for reports, news articles, or situations where a more objective or slightly
  elevated tone is desired. It highlights a situation where an action happened despite the absence of
  another, often expected or potentially problematic, action.

  - term: ずに
    meaning: Without doing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ことなく」, 「ずに」 is generally less formal and more commonly used in everyday conversation.
      While both express 'without doing', 「ことなく」 carries a heavier, more formal nuance, often emphasizing
      the significance of the absence.
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「ことなく」 and 「ずに」, consider the level of formality required
  for the situation. If you're writing a report or speaking in a formal setting, 「ことなく」 is generally more
  appropriate. For casual conversations, 「ずに」 will sound more natural. 「ことなく」 often highlights a contrast
  or unexpected outcome due to the absence of the action, while 「ずに」 is a simpler statement of 'without
  doing'.
