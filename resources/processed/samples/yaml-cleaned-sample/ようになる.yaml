writeup: |-
  The grammar point **ようになる** expresses a change that has occurred, reaching a state where a certain action can now be done, or a certain situation has come to be. It's often translated as "to reach the point that," "to come to be that," or "to turn into." It is attached to the dictionary form of a potential verb. For verbs that don't have a potential form naturally (like する), the potential form できる is used.

  **Key Points:**

  *  **Focus on Change:** It emphasizes the transition to a new state or ability.
  *  **Potential Form:** It always follows the potential form of a verb (or できる for する verbs).
  *  **Negative Usage:** It can also be used with the negative potential form (e.g., 食べられないようになる), indicating reaching a state where something *cannot* be done.
  *  **Not a Volitional Form:** It's important not to confuse this with expressing intention (e.g., ようとする). ようにする means "to make an effort to do something."
