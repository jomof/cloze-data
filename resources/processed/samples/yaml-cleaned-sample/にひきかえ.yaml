  「にひきかえ」 is a grammar pattern used to make **stark contrasts** between two things. It translates to "in comparison to (A), (B)" or "in stark contrast to (A), (B)". The literal sense hints at "pulling back and switching away from (A) to (B)", emphasizing the significant difference. You can think of it as highlighting how different B is when compared to A.

  It follows nouns, verbs, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives. Remember to use 「の」 after verbs and い-adjectives, and 「なの」 after な-adjectives.

  The two items being compared, (A) and (B), are usually presented as **opposite ends of a spectrum**, often with a subjective judgment where one is viewed favorably and the other unfavorably by the speaker.

  You can also start a sentence with 「それにひきかえ」 when comparing to something mentioned previously.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Both (A) and (B) must be **observable facts**. You cannot use 「にひきかえ」 for assumptions or guesses.
