  さえ is an adverbial particle in Japanese that is used to place emphasis on something existing in a certain state. It is often translated as "even". さえ has three primary meanings:

  *  **Analogical Reasoning (類推):** Implies that if something extreme is true, then a less extreme version is also likely true. Often used to highlight an example.
  *  **Limit (限定):** Indicates the minimum requirement or condition for something to happen. In this case, only the mentioned item is necessary.
  *  **Addition (添加):** Adds another item or situation to an existing one, often emphasizing its surprising or unexpected nature.

  さえ is frequently paired with other particles and is often followed by verbs in the negative form, with the overall meaning usually determined by the context of the sentence.

  **Fun Fact:** は, も, でも, and さえ are all adverbial particles that can be thought of as having a spectrum of likelihood or expectation:

  *  **は:** The subject is the topic, and the information is generally expected or neutral.
  *  **も:** The subject is in addition to something else, implying it's also true (and might be slightly unexpected).
  *  **でも:** Even the subject, implying it's somewhat unexpected or surprising.
  *  **さえ:** Even the subject, suggesting it's highly unexpected or extreme.

  Due to the unexpected and unusual nuance that さえ often conveys, it can also be translated as "let alone (A)" or "not to mention (A)".

false_friends:
  - term: まで
    meaning: Even, To even, To the extent of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both さえ and まで can mean "even," まで often implies a progression or extent, while さえ emphasizes
      the unexpectedness or extremity of the situation. まで can also mean "until."
  - term: 割に
    meaning: Although, Despite, Rather...for, Unexpectedly, Comparatively, Considering
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike さえ, which emphasizes the unexpected nature of something, 割に highlights a contrast between
      expectation and reality. It implies something is better or more than expected.
  - term: ても
    meaning: Even if, Even though
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ても expresses a conditional or concessive meaning ("even if [something happens]"), whereas
      さえ focuses on the surprising existence of something.
  - term: さえ〜ば
    meaning: If only…then, As long as..., Provided..., Only thing ... needs for ... is ...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: さえ〜ば creates a conditional clause, meaning "if only [this condition is met], then [this will
      happen]." While it involves "even," its primary function is to set a condition, unlike さえ which
      focuses on emphasis.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion with similar expressions, remember that さえ specifically
  emphasizes the unexpected or extreme nature of something. While まで can also mean "even," it often carries
  a sense of progression or extent. 割に highlights a contrast with expectations, and ても creates a conditional
  statement. さえ〜ば is a conditional grammar point, focusing on the necessary condition for something to
  occur.
