writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern **ときたら** is used to express "when it comes to (A)" or "concerning (A)". It's formed by combining the case-marking particle **と** with the verb **来る (くる)** in its past conditional form **来たら (きたら)**. It's important not to confuse this usage with the critical meaning of **ときたら** which translates to "that damned (A)".

  **ときたら** attaches to the end of a phrase, marking the topic of the conversation. The phrase preceding **ときたら** introduces the topic (A), and the following phrase (B) expresses the speaker's immediate thoughts or feelings about that topic. Often, (A) strongly reminds the speaker of (B). Alternatively, the connection between (A) and (B) might be something the speaker considers obvious or goes without saying. Because of this implied obviousness, the (B) phrase frequently starts with **やっぱり** or **やはり**, meaning "sure enough" or "as expected".
