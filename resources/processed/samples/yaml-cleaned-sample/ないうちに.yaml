writeup: In contrast to うちに, which often expresses the **optimal** or **best** time for something to occur,
  ないうちに expresses a timeframe where something **does not** happen, often leading to or preventing a negative
  outcome. It translates to "before (A) happens, (B)" or "without (A) happening, (B)." ないうちに is used with
  verbs in their ない (negative) form. The (B) phrase often highlights an action taken to prevent (A) or
  describes an unfortunate event that occurred while (A) was not happening. It's worth noting that 前に
  and ないうちに are used in similar situations, but ないうちに emphasizes the unfavorable result or the action
  taken to avoid it.

    meaning: Before, In front of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ないうちに, 前に doesn't inherently emphasize an unfavorable result. It simply indicates a
      chronological order.

    meaning: While, During
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ないうちに, うちに often implies taking advantage of a limited time frame or a period where
      a certain condition exists, often with a positive connotation or without a focus on preventing a
      negative outcome.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that ないうちに specifically highlights the prevention
  of a negative outcome or something happening without one's awareness, often with an undesirable consequence.
  While 前に simply indicates 'before,' and うちに signifies 'while' or 'during' a certain state, ないうちに carries
  this extra layer of negative implication.
