writeup: |-
  The grammar point つつある combines the particle つつ, meaning "while doing," with the verb ある, meaning "to be." It indicates that an action or process is ongoing and in a state of gradual change. The verb preceding つつある will be in its ます-stem form. This structure is considered formal and emphasizes the **slow and steady progression** of the action, often suggesting a change in state, such as increase, decrease, expansion, or contraction.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  つつある generally describes changes that happen over time and are not necessarily immediately noticeable.
  *  It is less commonly used for actions involving significant physical movement compared to ている. Instead, it often describes developments or trends.
  *  Verbs with a clear endpoint are less natural with つつある, as it emphasizes the ongoing process rather than the completion of the action.

  ている is usually more natural.

  or two actions happening at once?
