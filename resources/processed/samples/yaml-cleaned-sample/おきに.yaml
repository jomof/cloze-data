  「おきに」 is a combination of 「置き」, a suffix meaning "opening" or "interval", and the case marking particle 「に」. Primarily written without kanji, it is an expression used to show that something happens "every (A)", or "at intervals of (A)". The difference between something being interpreted as "every", or "at intervals of" can be tricky, though, so we'll look at both.

  Due to 「おきに」 being a suffix, it will be attached to the end of numbers, counters, or any 'space' that it is highlighting as being an "opening" or "interval". Looking at these sentences, we can see that the "interval" is a bit difficult to understand even in English. However, the easier way to think of 「おきに」 in this sense is "leaving a space of (A), (B)". So if we say "leaving a space of two days, (B)", it becomes a bit clearer that something is happening during the third day.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  It is very common to get 「ごとに」 and 「おきに」 mixed up. The former literally means "every". However, the latter having the meaning of "at intervals" makes things confusing. 「おきに」 itself will only mean "every" sometimes.
  *  Let's look at some examples of when these two expressions overlap in meaning, and when they do not:
  *  **Large time frames or distances:** Only 「ごとに」 will be used to express "every". It makes sense to ask "at what point" during a day, a week, or a month. Due to this, only 「おきに」 will mean "after the interval of (A)", while 「ごとに」 means "every".
  *  **Small time frames or distances:** Both 「ごとに」 and 「おきに」 may be used to express "every". It doesn't make sense to care about "at what point" during seconds, minutes, or hours. Here, because 「おきに」 points at the interval, it will mean "every interval of one second" etc, because nobody is going to ask "when did (B) happen during the next second", so the space is just assumed to be "one second".

  In summary, 「おきに」 will mean "every (A)" for seconds, minutes, hours, millimeters, centimeters, and kilometers. But it will mean "with spaces of" for almost anything bigger than that. This is not an exception to the rule, it is just a change of focus as spaces get larger. We can just remember that 「おきに」 always has one job. It highlights that (B) occurs after or outside of (A). While 「ごとに」 highlights (B) happening within (A).

  *  「一秒おきに」 - The space is "one second", so if 「おきに」 points to the beginning of the next second, the space is still only "one second". Because 「おきに」 doesn't care about where (B) happens within that next second, we assume straight away.
  *  「五年おきに」 - The space is "five years", so if 「おきに」 points to the beginning of the next year, the space becomes "six years", because we are going to want to know where (B) happens within that next year. It would be strange to assume someone is waiting for New Year of the sixth year to do something instantly.

  **Fun Fact:** This is a topic that native speakers frequently get wrong themselves, so don't worry if it takes a while to understand! If you are unsure about which one to use, think of 「おきに」 as "leaving intervals of (A), (B)" for most purposes. 「一時間」 tends to be the upper limit of time that most people disagree about whether the meaning is "every hour", or "every second hour". This makes sense, as the time frame is short, but still sort of long, so whether someone takes it as the beginning of the hour or some point during that hour being the important information, their opinions may differ. Remember though, 「おきに」 itself only ever points to the beginning of the space after (A), it doesn't care when/where (B) happens afterward.

post_false_friends_writeup: While 「おきに」, 「ごとに」, 「に」 (frequency), 「まい～のように」, 「につけ」, and 「たびに」 all relate
  to the frequency or regularity of events, it's important to understand their specific nuances. 「おきに」
  specifically indicates actions occurring at intervals, sometimes meaning 'every other'. 「ごとに」 means
  'every' without skipping. 「に」 (frequency) counts occurrences within a period. 「まい～のように」 means 'almost
  every'. 「につけ」 and 「たびに」 mean 'whenever' a specific event happens, focusing on the trigger rather than
  a strict schedule.
