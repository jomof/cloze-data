writeup: |-
  **それぞれ** is a Japanese noun that functions similarly to "each" or "respectively" in English. It indicates that something applies individually to every member of a group. Like other nouns in Japanese that can also be used adverbially (such as **ほとんど**, **沢山**, and **かなり**), **それぞれ** often appears before an entire sentence or before a noun modified by the particle **の**.

  **Etymology**: Interestingly, **それぞれ** originates from the same kanji as **其** (**そ**), which points to something close to the listener (like "that" in English). The repetition in **それぞれ** (其々) implies "that and that," which can be interpreted as "everyone" or "each one."

  - term: 当たり
    meaning: Per~, A~, Apiece, Each
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **それぞれ**, **当たり** is often used to express a rate or cost per unit. For example, 「一人当たり千円」
      means "1000 yen per person." While both can translate to "each," **それぞれ** emphasizes individuality
      within a group, whereas **当たり** emphasizes a distribution or calculation.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between **それぞれ** and **当たり**, remember that **それぞれ** focuses
  on the distinctiveness of each member within a group, highlighting their individual actions or attributes.
  **当たり**, on the other hand, is used when you are specifying an amount, quantity, or rate that applies
  to each unit or member.
