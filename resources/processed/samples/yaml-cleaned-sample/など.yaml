writeup: 「など」 is an adverbial particle used to indicate that what you're mentioning is just one example
  out of several possibilities. Think of it like saying "such as" or "things like" in English. It implies
  there are other similar items you could mention, but you're just giving a few examples. You can use
  it after nouns to show that the noun is an example from a larger group. You can also follow it with
  「の」 to show that the preceding noun is one type within a broader category. It's commonly written in
  kanji as 「等」, which itself carries a similar meaning to "etc." in English. Interestingly, the kanji
  「等」 is also used in the plural suffix 「ら」, which reinforces its function of indicating something as
  part of a larger set. While 「など」 can sometimes be replaced by 「なんか」, remember that 「なんか」 is never written
  with the kanji 「等」.
