details:
  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
etymology: The word 「など」 originates from the kanji 「等」, which also means 'etcetera' or 'and so forth.'
  The kanji itself implies that the item being discussed is part of a larger group of similar items. The
  use of 「など」 mirrors this concept, signaling that the mentioned item is an example and that other, similar
  items exist.
writeup: |-
  「など」 is an adverbial particle that indicates something is presented as an example, implying other similar items exist. It's often translated as "such as," "things like," or "and so on." 「など」 can follow a noun, indicating that it's one example from a group. Alternatively, 「など」 can be followed by 「の」 to show that the preceding noun is one type from a broader category. 「など」 is frequently written in its kanji form: 「等」, which has a meaning similar to "etc." in English.

  Fun Fact: The kanji 「等」 is also used in the pluralizing suffix 「ら」. This reinforces its function of highlighting an item's membership in a larger group.

  In essence, 「など」 presents an item (A) as part of a larger group of similar things, similar to how 「ら」 functions.

  Important Note: 「など」 is sometimes written as 「なんか」, and they are often interchangeable. However, 「なんか」 is never written using the kanji form 「等」.
