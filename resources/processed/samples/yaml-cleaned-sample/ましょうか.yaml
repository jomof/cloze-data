  As covered in our ましょう lesson, ましょう is one of the conjugations of the auxiliary verb ます, and is a common (polite) way to suggest that something be done **together**. Adding the particle か to this expression simply changes the nuance from "let's" to "shall we?", making it more of a direct question than ましょう by itself. Like ましょう, this expression is added to the ます stem form of any verb.

  One important thing to note is that these examples are generally **suggestions**, not strong **invitations**. In Japanese, there's a slight difference between the two, similar to English. For a stronger invitation, ませんか is more natural. Think of ませんか as closer to "Won't you do (A)?", while ましょうか is closer to a softer "Shall we do (A)?"
examples:
  - japanese: 日本語で話しましょうか。
    english: Shall we speak in Japanese?

    nuance: Using 「ましょうか」 makes the sentence a polite suggestion or question about speaking in Japanese.
  - japanese: 明日、一緒に映画を見に行きましょうか。
    english: Shall we go to see a movie together tomorrow?
    conjugation: polite (non-past)
    register: polite
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「ましょうか」 softens the suggestion of going to see a movie, making it sound friendly and less
      like a demand.
  - japanese: 少し休憩しませんでしょうか。
    english: Shall we take a short break?
    conjugation: negative polite (non-past)
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The negative form 「ませんでしょうか」 is a more formal and indirect way of suggesting a break, suitable
      for professional settings.

    conjugation: polite (non-past)

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The male speaker uses 「ましょうか」 to politely offer a ride home, indicating consideration for
      the listener. The phrase 「よかったら」 adds a touch of politeness and avoids being pushy.
  - japanese: 疲れたでしょう?肩を揉みましょうか?
    english: You must be tired, right? Shall I massage your shoulders?
    conjugation: polite (non-past)
    register: shitashii kuchō
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The question 「疲れたでしょう?」 shows concern, and 「揉みましょうか?」 is a caring and slightly suggestive
      offer. The use of 「でしょう?」 is a softer way of confirming his assumption and is common in intimate
      conversations.
  - japanese: 新しいレストラン、予約しましょうか?
    english: Shall we make a reservation at the new restaurant?
    conjugation: polite (non-past)

      together. The initiative taken can be perceived as flirty in this context.
  - japanese: 資料はもう一度確認しましたでしょうか。
    english: Shall we have checked the documents one more time?
    conjugation: past polite
    register: business nihongo
    setting: professional
    nuance: The past tense 「ましたでしょうか」 makes this a very polite and slightly formal inquiry about the status
      of a task, suitable for a business context. It's a softer way of asking if the confirmation has
      been done.
post_example_writeup: Remember that while ましょうか is a polite way to make suggestions or ask if something
  should be done, it's generally less assertive than using ませんか for invitations.
