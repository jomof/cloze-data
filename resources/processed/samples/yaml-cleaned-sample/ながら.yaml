writeup: ながら is a conjunction particle in Japanese that indicates two actions happening simultaneously
  by the same subject. It is attached to the **ます-stem of a verb (A)**, followed by the clause describing
  the second action (B). The English translation is often "while". Grammatically, the **(B) action is
  usually considered the main focus**, while the (A) action provides the context or background. It's **important**
  to remember that both actions must be performed by the same subject. While there is another usage of
  ながら to express unexpected co-occurrence (often followed by も), this explanation focuses on the simultaneous
  action meaning.

post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share the general idea of something happening concurrently,
  they have distinct nuances. To avoid confusion, remember that ながら specifically requires the **same subject**
  performing **two actions simultaneously**. Expressions like 「ている間に」 or 「の間に」 are more flexible and can
  be used when the subjects differ or when emphasizing a change or period of time. Consider the specific
  context and the relationship between the actions and subjects when choosing the appropriate expression.
