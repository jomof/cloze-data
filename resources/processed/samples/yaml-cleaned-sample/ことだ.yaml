  使用域: 一般
etymology: The grammar point 「ことだ」 combines the noun 「事 (こと)」, meaning 'thing' or 'matter,' with the copula
  「だ」, which indicates a statement or assertion. The combination creates a nuance of stating something
  as a matter of fact or importance, thus conveying advice, a recommendation, or an order.
writeup: |-
  The 「ことだ」 grammar point is a sentence-ending expression that conveys advice, strong recommendations, or commands. It's formed by attaching 「ことだ」 to the dictionary form (or ない form for negative commands) of a verb. The nuance is that something *should* or *ought to* be done (or not done). Because 「ことだ」 carries a sense of authority, it is often seen on signs giving instructions or in situations where rules are being stated.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Avoid using 「ことだ」 when giving general advice, especially to someone of higher status, as it can sound condescending. Other grammar points like 「ほうがいい」 or 「べきだ」 are more suitable for general advice.
  *  「ことだ」 is often used when emphasizing the importance of adhering to rules, regulations, or instructions.

      simply saying 飯 「めし」, especially when speaking to someone of higher status or in formal setting.
