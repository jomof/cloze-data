writeup: To express wanting something in Japanese, you use the particle が in combination with the い-adjective
  **欲しい (ほしい)**, meaning "to want (A)" or "to desire (A)". This functions just like any other い-adjective
  modifying a noun. It's **important** to remember that 欲しい in this context is used specifically for wanting
  *things* (nouns). When you want to *do* something (verbs), you'll use the auxiliary verb **たい**. However,
  ほしい can be used with verbs to express wanting someone else to do something, using the **てほしい** construction.
  For more information on this, please refer to our てほしい lesson.

      often including a manner or condition. 「がほしい」 is simpler and focused on wanting a tangible item.
post_false_friends_writeup: It's important to distinguish between wanting a thing (がほしい) and wanting to
  do something (たい). Additionally, remember that 「がる」 and 「たがる」 are used to describe the desires of others,
  not your own. While 「てほしい」 also expresses a desire, it focuses on what you want someone else to do,
  rather than what you want to possess.
