writeup: |-
  んだけど is an expression that combines んだ (explaining/giving cause) with けど (but). Together they translate simply as "but...", although the nuance is actually closer to "but with (A) as the reason… (B)", while (B) is sometimes left unsaid. This implies that the speaker is looking for a reply or does not want to say the (B) part of the sentence out of politeness or awkwardness.

  There are several different forms of this construction that are mostly interchangeable with each other. From most casual to most formal, they are as follows:

  *  んだけど
  *  んだけれど
  *  んだけれども
  *  んだが
  *  んですが

  ん may be replaced with の in any of the above expressions. However, it will make it slightly more formal.

  **Caution:** んだが, or simply だが, is probably the "strongest" out of these possibilities and is considered quite masculine. If you are going to use this form, we recommend making sure that your tone is a bit softer so that it does not sound too authoritative.

  **Fun Fact:** ん (or の) may sometimes be omitted completely, but this is not so common in modern Japanese.
