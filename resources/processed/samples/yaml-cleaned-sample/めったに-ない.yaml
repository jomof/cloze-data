writeup: めったに～ない is an expression that translates to "hardly", "seldom", or "rarely". Originally, 滅多 is
  a な-Adjective that means "thoughtless" or "reckless". As an adverb, 滅多に literally means "thoughtlessly"
  or "recklessly". めったに～ない is typically paired with a verb in the negative form. It can also follow a
  noun with the adverbial particle は. It's more common to see めったに written in hiragana than with kanji,
  though both forms are used. The nuance of めったに in a negative statement is that something doesn't happen
  casually or without a specific reason. It implies a low frequency of occurrence.

  - term: 陸に～ない
    meaning: Not well or properly, Not much or enough, Barely, Hardly
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike めったに～ない, ろくに～ない often implies a deficiency or lack of quality or sufficiency, rather
      than just a low frequency.
  - term: あまり～ない
    meaning: Not very, Not much, Not really, Hardly
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both express low frequency, あまり～ない is a more general expression of degree and can be
      used in a wider range of contexts. めったに～ない specifically emphasizes rarity.
  - term: ほとんど
    meaning: Almost all, Most, Hardly any, Few (Adverbial noun)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ほとんど can mean 'almost all' or 'mostly', which is the opposite of めったに～ない. When used with a
      negative, ほとんど～ない means 'almost never', which is similar but can sometimes imply a higher degree
      of infrequency than めったに～ない.
  - term: なかなか～ない
    meaning: Not really, Hardly, Not easily or readily, By no means, Far from
    kind: synonym
    nuance: なかなか～ない suggests difficulty or that something doesn't happen easily. めったに～ない focuses purely
      on the rarity of the event, without necessarily implying difficulty.
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions indicate low frequency, it's important to note
  the subtle differences. When you want to emphasize that something is rare and doesn't happen often,
  use めったに～ない. If you want to express that something isn't done well or sufficiently, use ろくに～ない. For
  a general expression of 'not very much', あまり～ない is suitable. Be mindful that ほとんど can also mean 'almost
  all'. Finally, なかなか～ない highlights the difficulty or improbability of something happening.
