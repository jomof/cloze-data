writeup: |-
  The grammar structure **てはかなわない** expresses that something is undesirable or unbearable. It combines the conjunction particle **て**, the adverbial particle **は**, and the negative form of the う-verb **叶う (kanau)**, meaning “to grant (a wish)” or “to realize (a goal).” The literal nuance is something like “it's not a dream come true for (A).” When used with verbs, the verb preceding **てはかなわない** is often in the passive form, indicating the speaker dislikes being the target of the action. However, active verb forms are also possible.

  This structure can also follow the conjunctive form of い-adjectives, or appear as **ではかなわない** after な-adjectives.

  **Important Consideration:** Be careful not to confuse **叶う (kanau)** ‘to grant' with **敵う (kanau)** ‘to be a match for'. While both are read as "kanau", their grammatical usage and meanings are distinct.

    nuance: Unlike 「てはかなわない」 which expresses something is unbearable, 「にはかなわない」 indicates a lack of ability
      to compete with something or someone.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「てはかなわない」 with 「にはかなわない」, remember that the former expresses
  a feeling of being overwhelmed by an undesirable situation, while the latter describes a situation of
  being outmatched or unable to compete. The presence of a verb in て-form before 「はかなわない」 is a key differentiator.
