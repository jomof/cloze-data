writeup: 「を兼ねて」 is a grammar pattern that uses the standard meaning of the る-Verb 「兼ねる」, which means "to
  stretch across to" or "to do concurrently." The adverbial particle 「を」 marks a noun that is considered
  the secondary event or state. 「兼ねて」 is then followed by the primary event or state that will be done
  concurrently with the first noun. This pattern is often translated as "to (A) at the same time as (B),"
  "to double as (A)," or "to (A) also partly for the purpose of (B)." 「を兼ねて」 often highlights the part
  after 「兼ねて」 as the **primary goal**, while the part before 「を兼ねて」 acts to support it, makes sense to
  be done together, or provides a reason for doing the primary goal. To help remember that the part before
  「を兼ねて」 is the secondary aspect, you can think of it literally as "while extending across to (A), (B)."
  When there are multiple secondary goals, the case-marking particle 「と」 is used to list the nouns before
  「を兼ねて」.

  - term: かねる
    meaning: Cannot, Be unable to, Hard to, Hesitant to

post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse 「を兼ねて」 with the verb 「かねる」. While both share the
  kanji 「兼」, their meanings and usage are quite different. 「を兼ねて」 indicates doing something for multiple
  purposes, whereas 「かねる」 means 'cannot' or 'is difficult to do'.
