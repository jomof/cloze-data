writeup: |-
  同士 (**どうし**) is a noun that functions similarly to a suffix. It indicates a mutual relationship or shared characteristic between the nouns it connects. Think of it as expressing "fellow," "mutual," or "together."

  You attach 同士 directly to another noun. The basic structure is **noun + 同士**. You can also use **noun + 同士 + の + noun** to express that the second noun is a group of the first noun.

  There are two primary ways 同士 expresses mutuality:

  *  **種類 (shurui) - Type:** Indicating things or people are of the same kind or category.
  *  **関係 (kankei) - Relationship:** Highlighting a shared relationship between individuals or entities.

  **Important Consideration:** While 同士 is mainly used with people or living things, occasionally it can refer to inanimate objects, though this is less common. The kanji 士 (shi) meaning "gentleman" hints at its primary use with people.
