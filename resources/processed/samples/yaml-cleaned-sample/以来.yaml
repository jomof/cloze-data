  The noun 「以来 (いらい)」, meaning "ever since", is used with the て-form of verbs or with nouns to indicate that something (B) has continued or will continue uninterrupted from a point in time (A). It conveys the sense of "since (A)", "henceforth", or "ever since (A)". The crucial aspect of 「以来」 is that it emphasizes an **ongoing state** that persists or will persist unless an external factor causes a change.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While 「以来」 primarily denotes a continuous state, it can also describe a total number of occurrences of (B) since (A). In this case, it highlights the accumulated amount of (B) as being noteworthy or surprising compared to a simple 「から」.
  *  Be mindful that 「以来」 is generally **not used for very recent events**. It typically refers to a period of some duration.
