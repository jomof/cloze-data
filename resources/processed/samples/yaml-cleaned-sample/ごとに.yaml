  **ごとに** combines the noun **ごと** (matter, thing) and the particle **に**. It functions adverbially to indicate that something occurs "every (A)" or "at intervals of (A)". It typically follows a noun or a verb in its non-past form. While it can be used with verbs, it's more commonly seen with nouns or phrases ending in nouns.

  **Important Consideration:** The kanji 毎 (mai), meaning "every," shares the same meaning as **ごと** (when read as **ごと**). This is helpful when distinguishing **ごとに** from **おきに**, another expression for "every" that emphasizes the *interval* or *gap* between occurrences.

  Think of it this way:

  *  **(A)ごとに**: During each and every instance of (A), (B) happens.
  *  **(A)おきに**: After an interval of (A), (B) happens.

  For example:

  *  **一週間ごとに** (isshūkan goto ni): Every week (each week without skipping).
  *  **一週間おきに** (isshūkan oki ni): Every other week (with a one-week interval).

  While some native speakers, especially younger ones, may use these interchangeably, understanding the nuance is crucial for accurate comprehension and expression.

  say 'each' or 'every'. Use 「おきに」 when you specifically want to emphasize the interval or gap between
  occurrences. The other expressions, while similar in meaning, carry slightly different nuances related
  to frequency, contingency, or approximation.
