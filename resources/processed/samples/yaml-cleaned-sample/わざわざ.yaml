writeup: |-
  わざわざ is an adverb used to express that someone has gone out of their way to do something. It conveys the idea of taking extra effort or making a special trip. It can be translated as "expressly," "especially," or "to go out of one's way to (do something)." わざわざ is typically placed at the beginning of a sentence, preceding the statement about the intentional action. While often used in positive contexts to express gratitude for someone's effort, it can also be used in negative contexts to express surprise or disapproval at unnecessary effort.

  **Fun Fact:** Although rarely used, the kanji form 態態 can be seen. The kanji 態 signifies "purpose" or "intent," highlighting the speaker's strong will or goal behind the action. The translation of わざわざ depends on the outcome:

  *  **Positive result:** Expressing appreciation for the effort made.
  *  **Negative result:** Expressing that the effort was unnecessary or even unwelcome.
  *  **Undecided result:** Focusing on the intention behind the action.

  **Caution:** Be careful not to confuse わざわざ with わざと. While both share the kanji 態, わざと specifically means "on purpose" and lacks the nuances of extra effort or going out of one's way that わざわざ carries.
etymology: The kanji 態 (tai) in 態態 signifies 'purpose', 'intent', or 'attitude', emphasizing the deliberate
  nature of the action.

  - term: わざと
    meaning: Intentionally, on purpose
    kind: similar meaning
    nuance: Unlike わざわざ, わざと simply means 'on purpose' and doesn't necessarily imply extra effort or going
      out of one's way.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing わざわざ and わざと, remember that わざわざ emphasizes the effort
  taken, while わざと focuses solely on the intention behind the action. If you want to highlight that someone
  went to extra trouble, use わざわざ. If you simply want to say something was done intentionally, use わざと.
