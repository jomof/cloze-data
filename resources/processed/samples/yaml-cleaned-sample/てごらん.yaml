writeup: |-
  「てごらん」 is an honorific language expression in Japanese, similar to 「なさい」. It's usually translated as "please try to (A)," where (A) is the verb connected to 「ごらん」 using the 「て」 conjunction. While translated as "please try to (A)," the literal meaning of 「覧 (らん)」 is "to look" or "to peruse" (to look at one's leisure, without rushing). Therefore, 「てごらん」 can be seen as similar to 「てみる」 ("to try") but with an emphasis on "try as you like, when it suits you."

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  As 「ご覧」 is honorific, you can't use it for your own actions or things you will "try." It's used to suggest actions to others.
  *  Sometimes 「ごらん」 and 「なさい」 are paired as 「ごらんなさい」. This slightly strengthens the suggestion and can be perceived as a very light command. Because of this, 「ごらんなさい」 is mainly used by superiors or elders when asking a subordinate or younger person to try something.

false_friends:
  - term: な
    meaning: Do not, Don't (Prohibitive)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「てごらん」 which suggests trying something, 「な」 is used to prohibit an action. For example,
      「触るな」 means "Don't touch."
  - term: ないでください
    meaning: Please don't (Polite request)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike the suggestive nature of 「てごらん」, 「ないでください」 is a polite request to refrain from doing
      something. For example, 「ここに入らないでください」 means "Please don't enter here."
  - term: てください
    meaning: Please do (Polite request)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both express a request, 「てください」 is a more direct and polite request, whereas 「てごらん」
      carries a nuance of suggesting or encouraging someone to try something. 「読んでください」 is a polite request
      to "Please read," while 「読んでごらん」 is a suggestion to "Try reading."
  - term: なさい
    meaning: Command to do
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Both 「てごらん」 and 「なさい」 can express a command, but 「なさい」 is generally more direct and can sound
      authoritative, especially when used by superiors. 「食べなさい」 is a direct command to "Eat," while 「食べてごらん」
      is a gentler suggestion to "Try eating."
  - term: てみる
    meaning: To try to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「てみる」 expresses one's own intention to try something, while 「てごらん」 is used to suggest someone
      else try something. 「食べてみる」 means "I will try to eat," whereas 「食べてごらん」 means "Try eating."
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「てごらん」 with these similar expressions, remember that 「てごらん」
  is specifically used to suggest or encourage someone else to do something, often with a nuance of trying
  it out. 「な」 and 「ないでください」 are about prohibition, while 「てください」 is a more direct polite request. 「なさい」
  is a more direct command. 「てみる」 refers to one's own actions of trying something.
