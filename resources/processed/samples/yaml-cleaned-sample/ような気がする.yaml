writeup: ような気がする is a phrase that takes the base meaning of 気がする "to have a feeling that (A)" or "to give
  off a vibe that (A)," and adds an extra layer of uncertainty through the use of the auxiliary verb よう.
  This can be understood as meaning "to have a funny feeling that (A)" or "to kinda have a feeling that
  (A)." As always, よう must be attached to the attributive form of any word that comes before it. **Important
  Consideration:** 気がする is quite a bit stronger than ような気がする, so the latter will often be used when the
  speaker is not 100% sure about something and doesn't want to sound rude.
examples:
  - japanese: あの技はなんか簡単そう。俺でも出来るような気がする。
    english: That technique looks kind of easy. I have a feeling that even I could do it.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: casual
    setting: confident
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker uses 「俺」, a masculine pronoun, indicating a casual tone. The phrase 「なんか簡単そう」
      adds to the casual feeling.
  - japanese: そこへ一人で行くのは危ないような気がする。ガイドと一緒に行った方がいいと思う。

  observation.
