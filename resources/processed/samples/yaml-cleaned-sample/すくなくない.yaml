writeup: The expression **すくなくない** (skunaku nai) literally means "not few." It's formed by negating the
  い-adjective **少ない** (sukunai), which means "few" or "little." Therefore, **すくなくない** translates to "quite
  a few," "quite a lot," or simply "many." It emphasizes that the quantity is more than just a small number.
  You can use it to describe a noticeable amount of something. To use this grammar point, place a noun
  followed by the particle は, が, or も, and then follow it with すくなくない or its polite form, すくなくありません. It's
  **important** to remember that the ない in 少ない is part of the word itself and not the negative い-adjective
  ない.
