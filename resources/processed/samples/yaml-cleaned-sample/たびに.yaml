writeup: 「たびに」 is used to express that something happens **every time** a particular event occurs. It's
  the adverbial form of the noun 「度」(ど), meaning "time" (as in "at the time of"). 「たびに」 is typically used
  with verbs or nouns. When used with a noun, the particle 「の」 is required before 「たびに」. Think of it like
  saying "every time (something happens)". Similar to 「ごとに」, 「たびに」 means "every", but 「たびに」 often emphasizes
  the **repeated occurrence of an action or event** rather than simply marking intervals of time. Therefore,
  you'll usually see 「たびに」 used to highlight something actively taking place.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「たびに」 emphasizes the **repetition of an

  every time, the other options might be more suitable. Think about whether you want to highlight the
  direct connection between the two events - if so, 「たびに」 is a good choice.
