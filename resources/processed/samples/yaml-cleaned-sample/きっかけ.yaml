  「きっかけ」 (**kikkake**) means "trigger," "start," "cue," or "opportunity." It describes the **initial event or reason** that led to a subsequent action or change. You can think of it as the domino that starts a chain reaction.

  The most common patterns are:

  *  **(A)をきっかけに(B)**: "With A as the trigger, B happened." or "Taking A as an opportunity, B happened."
  *  **(A)がきっかけで(B)**: "A was the trigger, and because of that, B happened."

  Both patterns express that A was the **starting point** or **catalyst** for B. You'll often see 「きっかけ」 used with verbs in the past tense, or with nouns. When used with verbs, it's common to see a nominalizer like 「の」 or 「こと」.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  「きっかけ」 implies that the connection between A and B might not have been immediately obvious or inevitable. It suggests an element of chance or a deliberate choice made because of the opportunity presented by A.
  *  It's generally not used when the cause-and-effect relationship is very direct or expected.
