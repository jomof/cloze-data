  Similar to みたい, **ようだ** is used when making observations in Japanese. This auxiliary verb expresses three main ideas:

  *  **たとえ (Example):** Using (A) as an example to highlight how (B) looks or acts.
  *  **推定 (Assumption):** Using (A) as a reason for an assumption about (B).
  *  **例示 (Illustration):** Presenting (A) as an example of what (B) is.

  **ようだ** typically relies on direct information or experience, indicating the speaker's high confidence. It often appears in its kanji form, **様だ**. It can be used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (requiring な), and nouns (requiring の).

  While **ようだ** and **そうだ** share similar usage, **そうだ** suggests less confidence. Thus, **ようだ** is preferable for stating obvious or observable facts.

  **Important Consideration:** **ようだ** is significantly more formal than **みたい**, making it less common in casual conversation.
