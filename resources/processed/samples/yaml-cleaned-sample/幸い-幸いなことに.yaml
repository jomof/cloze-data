  **幸いなことに** or simply **幸い** is a set phrase in Japanese that means "luckily" or "fortunately." It indicates that a positive outcome occurred, often despite potential negative circumstances. This usage directly reflects the meaning of the *na*-adjective **幸い** as "blessedness" or "luck."

  In most cases, **幸いなことに** will appear at the beginning of sentences, introducing the fortunate event that followed.

  It's interesting to note the connection to **ことに**. This is a combination of **こと** ("thing" or "matter") and the particle **に**. Literally, it conveys a sense of "to that matter/thing." **ことに** is generally used to emphasize a strong emotional reaction (positive or negative) to the situation being described. **幸いなことに** then specifically highlights the fortunate aspect of the situation.
