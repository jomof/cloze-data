  が早いか is a Japanese grammatical structure used to describe an action that is immediately followed by another action, often unexpectedly. It combines the particle が, the i-adjective 早い (hayai - early, fast), and the adverbial particle か. The literal sense hints at the immediacy: "(A happens), or possibly even sooner than that, (B happens)." This emphasizes how quickly (B) follows (A), to the point where (A) might not even be fully completed before (B) begins.

  **Key points:**

  *  **Formality:** This pattern is considered formal and is typically found in written language or more formal speech.
  *  **Verb Conjugation:** It connects directly to verbs in their dictionary form or past tense form. While both are possible, the **dictionary form is more common**.
  *  **(B) Clause:** The verb in the clause following が早いか will always be in the past tense.
  *  **Nature of (A):** The action described by the verb before が早いか tends to be something that happens quickly or has a clear endpoint. To emphasize the completion of an action that doesn't naturally have a defined end, you'll often see the verb's stem form combined with 終わる (owaru - to finish).
  *  **Nature of (B):** The action in the (B) clause is often unexpected but also usually volitional, meaning it's done intentionally.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Past Tense Focus:** が早いか inherently describes events that have already occurred, so it cannot be used to express future wishes or intentions.
  *  **Speaker's Actions:** This grammar point is generally not used to describe the speaker's own actions.
