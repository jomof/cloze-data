writeup: |-
  **そのため(に)** is a conjunction in Japanese, frequently used to indicate a consequence or purpose stemming from a preceding statement. It literally translates to "for that reason" or "to that end." You'll find **そのため(に)** at the beginning of a sentence, connecting it logically to the previous one. The particle に is optional and often left out.

  While **ため** can also mean "sake" or "benefit," when used in **そのため(に)**, it primarily focuses on the **reason or purpose**. Although primarily used for logical consequences or intentional actions, it can occasionally highlight an unfortunate result.

  **Fun Fact:** The kanji **為** is versatile and can be read as *tame*, *suru*, *naru*, *nasu*, and *tsukuru*, each carrying a nuance related to putting something to use and achieving a result.
