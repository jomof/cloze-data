writeup: |-
  The noun 以前 (izen), meaning "preceding" or "prior to," is used as a suffix to indicate that something fails to meet even the minimum requirements of another thing. Think of it as expressing "before even (A), (B)" in English. This often carries a nuance of criticism, implying something is thoughtless or irresponsible.

  以前 directly follows nouns, the dictionary form of verbs, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives. It's typically followed by the case-marking particle に or の, depending on whether it modifies a verb or a noun.

  While similar to 前 (mae), 以前 emphasizes a greater distance in the past or a more fundamental difference. It's like an emphatic version of 前, often leading to the critical tone by stating something like "way before (A), (B)" or "long before you even think of (A), (B)."
