writeup: |-
  The particle **きり** indicates that something happened for the **first and last time**, or that there is a **limit** to something. It comes from the verb **切る (きる)** meaning "to cut," suggesting a clean break or end.

  When used with verbs, typically in the past tense, **きり** signifies that an action occurred once, and nothing else has happened since. This often implies a lasting consequence or a change in situation.

  When used with nouns or counters, **きり** emphasizes the limit or extent of something, meaning "nothing more, nothing less." It specifies that only the mentioned item or quantity is involved.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Casual form:** **っきり** is a more casual variant of **きり**. There's no significant difference in meaning.
  *  **Emphasis on finality:** きり often carries a nuance of finality or completion, especially when used with verbs.

  - term: だけしか
    meaning: To emphasize '~only', Nothing but
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「きり」, 「だけしか」 strongly emphasizes the exclusivity and often implies a feeling of limitation
      or dissatisfaction. For example, 「これだけしかありません」 (This is all I have) sounds more restrictive than
      if 「きり」 were used.
  - term: しか～ない
    meaning: There's only, Nothing but
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「だけしか」, 「しか～ない」 emphasizes that there are no other options or possibilities. 「一つしかない」
      (There's only one) highlights the lack of alternatives more directly than 「一つきり」.
  - term: だけ
    meaning: Only, Just
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「だけ」 simply indicates a limit or restriction, similar to the noun/counter usage of 「きり」. However,
      「きり」 often carries a stronger sense of finality or that something has been concluded, especially
      with verbs. 「私だけです」 (It's just me) is a simple statement, whereas 「私きりです」 can imply there's no one
      else and that's the end of the matter.
  - term: ままに (as desired)
    meaning: As is, While remaining, Left in a state
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both can sometimes appear in similar contexts, 「ままに」 focuses on maintaining a certain
      state or condition. 「ドアを開けたままにした」 (I left the door open) describes the state of the door, whereas
      「ドアを開けたきりになっている」 emphasizes that opening the door was the last action taken and it remains open
      since then.
  - term: たなり・なり
    meaning: While... ~ing, Remaining, Not or ever since, Keep or leave
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「たなり・なり」 emphasizes a continued state after an action, often with a sense of neglect or lack
      of further action. 「本を読んだなりで寝てしまった」 (I fell asleep while still reading the book) focuses on the
      continuous state of reading leading to sleep, while 「本を読んだきり寝てしまった」 focuses on the action of reading
      being the last thing done before sleeping.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「だけしか」 and 「しか～ない」 are similar to 「きり」 in expressing exclusivity, they
  often carry a stronger sense of limitation or a lack of alternatives. 「だけ」 is a more general term for
  "only" or "just," while 「きり」 often implies a sense of finality or that something happened once and no
  more. 「ままに」 and 「たなり・なり」 focus on a continued state after an action, whereas 「きり」 emphasizes the single
  instance of an action and what followed since then. To avoid confusion, consider whether you want to
  emphasize the limit, the lack of alternatives, or the single occurrence of an event with subsequent
  consequences.
