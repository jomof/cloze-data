  万が一, or sometimes simply 万一, literally means "one in ten thousand." It functions similarly to English phrases like "in the unlikely event of (A)" or "just in case (A)." It usually precedes a clause outlining a precaution against a potential negative situation or the consequence of such a situation. 万が一 is primarily used adverbially and often appears at the beginning of a sentence.

  **Important Note:** While both 万が一 and 万一 express the same idea, 万が一 is more common in everyday speech due to its ease of pronunciation.

    meaning: Just in case, Just to be sure

      expecting something negative to happen, whereas 万が一 often implies preparing for an unlikely but
      potentially negative situation.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 万が一 with similar expressions, remember that 万が一 emphasizes
  the unlikelihood or the worst-case aspect of a situation. 「ばあいは」 is more neutral and general, while
  「一応」 focuses on the precautionary aspect without the same emphasis on unlikelihood or negativity.
