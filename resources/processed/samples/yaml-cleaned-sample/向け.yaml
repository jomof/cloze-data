  向け (muke) is a noun that means "intended for," "aimed at," or "oriented toward." It's derived from the transitive verb 向ける (mukeru), meaning "to turn something towards" or "to direct something at." Think of it as something being specifically **designed or targeted** for a particular group or purpose.

  *  It often attaches directly to nouns to specify the target audience or intended use.
  *  You'll commonly see it followed by the particle に when followed by a phrase, like 「子供向けに」 (kodomo muke ni - for children).
  *  It can also be followed by the particle の when linked with another noun, such as in 「オフィス向けのパソコン」 (ofisu muke no pasokon - a computer intended for office use).

  **Important Consideration:** While 向け indicates a specific intention, it doesn't necessarily mean the item is exclusively for that group. For instance, a book written 「子供向けに」 can still be enjoyed by adults.

  **Caution:** Be mindful of the subtle difference between 向け and 向き (muki). While both can express suitability, 向け, stemming from the transitive verb 向ける, emphasizes the **intentional design or targeting**. On the other hand, 向き, originating from the intransitive verb 向く (muku - to face), suggests something is **suitable or naturally inclined** towards a certain direction or group, but not necessarily intentionally made for them.

post_example_writeup: Notice how 「向け」 clearly indicates the intended recipient or purpose. While 「向き」
  can sometimes be interchangeable, 「向け」 carries a stronger sense of deliberate design or targeting. Pay
  attention to the context to understand the subtle difference.

    meaning: Towards, To face, To head to
    kind: synonym

      recipient or purpose.
  - term: 向き
    meaning: Suitable for, Facing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to 「向け」, 「向き」 emphasizes suitability or natural inclination rather than a specific
      intention in design or targeting. It can also mean 'facing a certain direction'.
  - term: に合わせて・に合った
    meaning: In accordance with, Matching, Fitting, Suitable for, Adjust or tune to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「向け」, 「に合わせて・に合った」 emphasize conformity, matching, or adjustment to something. They
      suggest something is made to fit or be in harmony with something else, not necessarily specifically
      intended for it.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「向け」 with similar expressions, remember that 「向け」 always
  implies a specific intention or target. 「に向かって」 and 「に向けて」 are about physical direction. 「向き」 is about
  general suitability or physical orientation. 「に合わせて」 and 「に合った」 are about matching or being in accordance
  with something else.
