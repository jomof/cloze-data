  Being the adverbial form of 余る "to remain; to be in excess; to be too much", あまりに is a grammar structure used to express an **excessive** degree of something that leads to a particular outcome. It often conveys a sense of surprise or shock regarding the extent of the first part of the sentence. You can think of it as emphasizing that something is "way too..." or "so much...that".

  あまりに is typically followed by a verb or adjective that describes the excessive quality. When modifying a noun, use あまりの + noun. Occasionally, にも is used instead of に to further emphasize the excessiveness.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  あんまり is a colloquial form of あまり and is frequently used in casual conversation. However, it's best to avoid あんまり in formal or official writing.

post_example_writeup: Notice how 「あまりに」 often precedes adjectives describing the degree of something,
  like 「楽すぎる」 (too easy), 「遅く」 (late), 「つまらない」 (boring), 「大きい」 (big), 「赤い」 (red), 「眩しい」 (dazzling), 「可愛い」
  (cute), and 「素晴らしい」 (wonderful). It sets the stage for the consequence or feeling described in the latter
  part of the sentence.

  - term: すぎる
    meaning: Too much, Very
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「あまりに」, 「すぎる」 is a verb suffix directly attached to verbs or i-adjectives to indicate
      excessiveness without necessarily implying a surprising result. For example, 「飲みすぎる」 (to drink too
      much).
  - term: なかなか
    meaning: Very, Quite, Considerably
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「あまりに」, which emphasizes excess leading to a consequence, 「なかなか」 expresses a higher-than-expected
      degree, often with a positive connotation. For example, 「なかなか美味しい」 (quite delicious).
  - term: あまり
    meaning: So much...that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While semantically similar, 「あまり」 used adverbially often appears with a following noun using
      the structure 「あまりのNに」. 「あまりに」 directly modifies adjectives and verbs.
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To avoid confusion, remember that 「あまりに」 highlights the **extent** of something
  that causes a certain outcome, often with a hint of surprise. 「すぎる」 simply means "too much." 「なかなか」
  implies a positive degree. Pay attention to the grammatical structure: 「あまりに + adjective/verb」 versus
  「あまりの + noun + に」.'
