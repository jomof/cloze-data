  使用域: 一般
writeup: As the adverbial form of 余る "to be in excess," あまりに is used to express that something is excessive,
  leading to a certain result. It often conveys a sense of surprise or shock regarding the degree of the
  first part of the sentence (A). 「あまりに」 is typically translated as "so much (A) that (B)" or "way too
  much (A)." For instance, you might say, "あまりに疲れていたので、すぐに寝てしまった" (I was so tired that I fell asleep immediately).
  When followed by a noun, あまりに becomes あまりの, as in 「あまりの暑さに、外に出るのをやめた」 (It was so hot that I stopped
  going outside). Sometimes, にも is used instead of に for further emphasis on the excessiveness of (A).
  Thinking of あまりに as meaning "excessively" can be helpful; in many cases, "it is excessively (A), so
  (B)" will capture the intended nuance. **Important Consideration:** あんまり is a colloquial variant of
  あまり and is commonly spoken. However, it should be avoided in formal or official writing.

post_example_writeup: Notice the subtle difference between あまりに and あんまり. While both indicate excess,
  あんまり carries a more casual tone and is frequently used in informal conversation. In writing, stick to
  あまりに for a more standard expression.
false_friends:
  - term: すぎる
    meaning: Too much, Very
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike あまりに, ～すぎる is a verb ending attached directly to verbs or i-adjectives, and it focuses
      on the action or state being excessive rather than the surprising result of that excess. For example,
      「食べすぎる」 (to eat too much).
  - term: なかなか
    meaning: Very, Quite, Considerably
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike あまりに, なかなか expresses a high degree or quality, often with a positive connotation, or
      to acknowledge something is surprisingly good or difficult. It doesn't inherently convey the negative
      or surprising result that あまりに does. For example, 「なかなか美味しい」 (quite delicious).
  - term: あまり
    meaning: So much...that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While あまり can also mean "so much that," あまりに functions specifically as an adverb, often emphasizing
      the surprising or excessive nature more strongly than just あまり alone. 「あまりの」 is the adjectival form,
      used before nouns, similar to how あまりに modifies verbs or adjectives.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up these expressions, remember that すぎる directly modifies
  verbs and i-adjectives to indicate doing something too much. なかなか expresses a considerable degree, often
  positive, without the sense of a surprising consequence. あまり serves as a more general expression of
  excess, while あまりに specifically functions adverbially to emphasize the extent of something leading to
  a result, often with a hint of surprise.
