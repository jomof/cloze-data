writeup: The grammar point **いか (以下)** is used to indicate that something is equal to or less than a specified
  amount or level. It literally means "below" or "under" and is formed with the kanji **以 (い)**, meaning
  "by means of," and **下 (か)**, meaning "below." You attach **いか** directly to the noun or number representing
  the upper limit. It can be translated as "less than or equal to," "under," "below," or "not exceeding."
  **Important Considerations:** Just like **以上 (いじょう)**, **以下** can also be used to refer to "the following"
  or "the rest" when discussing items in a list or document.
