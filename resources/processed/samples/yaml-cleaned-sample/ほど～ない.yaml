  The grammar point ほど～ない uses the noun ほど, meaning "extent," to express that something does not reach a certain degree or level. The basic structure is **[A]ほど[B]ない**, where (A) represents the extent or comparison point, and (B) is something that does not reach that extent. This can be literally translated as "(B) is not to the extent of (A)." It's commonly used for two main purposes:

  *  **Expressing a lack of intensity:** Stating that something isn't as intense or significant as expected or imagined. For example, 「思ったほど難しくない」 (omotta hodo muzukashikunai) means "It's not as difficult as I thought."
  *  **Making comparisons:** Indicating that something is inferior or different in degree compared to something else. For example, 「犬は猫ほど大きくない」 (inu wa neko hodo ookikunai) means "Dogs are not as big as cats."
examples:
  - japanese: 今日は思ったほど暑くなかった。
    english: Today wasn't as hot as I expected.
    conjugation: past tense

      not reach the expected level of heat.

    english: It is nothing to worry about so much. (This is not as serious as you think it is)

    nuance: 「悩む」 is the dictionary form of the verb "to worry," suggesting the level of concern is not
      warranted. The phrase 「～じゃない」 is a casual way to say "it isn't."

      and cars. The use of 「～けど」 creates a contrast.

      stay with them.

  or extent. It's a versatile construction for expressing comparisons and managing expectations.
false_friends:
  - term: より～のほうが
    meaning: To be more ~ than ~
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ほど～ない which states something *isn't as* something else, より～のほうが directly states something
      *is more* than something else, making a positive comparison.
  - term: より
    meaning: More than, Over
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both are used for comparisons, より simply indicates "more than" without the negation
      of ほど～ない. It doesn't inherently imply that the first item is not as good as the second.
  - term: ほど
    meaning: The more, About, To the extent that, So much… that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While ほど is part of the grammar point, when used alone or in other constructions like ～ほど～,
      it expresses the degree or extent itself, or indicates a proportional relationship, not a negation
      of that extent.
  - term: まで
    meaning: Even, To even, To the extent of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: まで indicates a limit or extent, often emphasizing surprise or extremity. It doesn't negate
      a comparison in the same way ほど～ない does; instead, it highlights reaching a certain point.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that ほど～ない focuses on stating that something
  *doesn't reach* a certain level, while the other expressions emphasize a direct comparison (より), the
  extent itself (ほど alone), or reaching a certain limit (まで).
