  When used at the end of sentences, 「んだって」 often expresses information the speaker has heard from someone else. It's a casual way of conveying hearsay. 「んだって」 is a combination of 「ん」 (or 「なん」), the auxiliary verb 「だ」, and the colloquial quoting particle 「って」.

  *  「ん」 or 「なん」 functions to provide an explanation or reason.
  *  「だ」 asserts something as being true.
  *  「って」 is a contraction of 「と言って」 (is said) or 「と思って」 (is thought).

  Therefore, the nuance is similar to "it is that (A) was said/thought." In practice, it translates to phrases like "I heard that (A)" or "it's thought that (A)."

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  「んだって」 is quite **casual** and is primarily used in conversations with close friends and family. Avoid using it in formal situations or with people you don't know well.
  *  The 「ん」 often nasalizes the preceding vowel sound, which is a characteristic of casual speech.

    nuance: 「～ね」 is a common tag question in casual conversation to seek agreement or confirmation. The

  - japanese: トム、また元カノと付き合っているんだって。
    english: I heard Tom is dating his ex-girlfriend again.

    setting: flirty
    nuance: 「もしよかったら、一緒に行かない?」 is a casual and inviting way to suggest going together. The use of 「～ない?」

      suitable for flirting.

      the speaker's frustration.

      a slightly childlike or emphatic tone.
    speaker_gender: female
post_example_writeup: Remember that 「んだって」 is a very casual expression. While it's useful for understanding
  casual conversations and media, be mindful of the context and your relationship with the listener before
  using it.
false_friends:
  - term: ときいた
    meaning: I heard that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「んだって」, 「と聞いた」 is a more formal and direct way of saying "I heard that." It's appropriate
      for a wider range of situations.
  - term: って (quotation)
    meaning: Casual quotation
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「んだって」 includes the quoting particle 「って」, simply using 「って」 after a direct quote is
      used to report speech casually. 「んだって」 specifically implies hearsay.
  - term: とか
    meaning: I heard that… something like, They said ... or something
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「とか」 indicates an example or a non-exhaustive list. While it can sometimes imply hearing something,
      it has a broader usage than just conveying hearsay like 「んだって」.
  - term: らしい ①
    meaning: Seems like, Apparently, I heard
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Both 「らしい」 and 「んだって」 can convey hearsay, but 「らしい」 often suggests the speaker is drawing
      a conclusion based on indirect evidence or a general impression, whereas 「んだって」 is a more direct
      report of something heard.
  - term: そうだ
    meaning: I heard that, It is said that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「そうだ」 is a more standard and versatile way to express "I heard that." It's less casual than
      「んだって」 and suitable for a broader range of contexts.
  - term: だって
    meaning: I heard/was said, Because, But, Even or also, Even if or even though
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「だって」 can mean "I heard/was said" (functioning similarly to 「んだって」), it has many other
      meanings related to reasons, contrasts, and emphasis. The 「ん」 in 「んだって」 specifically narrows it
      down to the hearsay meaning.
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse 「んだって」 with other similar-sounding grammar points
  or uses of 「って」 and 「だって」. 「そうだ」 and 「と聞いた」 are safer alternatives in situations where you're unsure
  about the level of formality. Remember that 「んだって」 specifically conveys that the information was heard
  from someone else in a casual setting.
