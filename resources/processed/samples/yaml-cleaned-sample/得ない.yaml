writeup: '得る is a る-verb meaning "to gain" or "to acquire". When attached to the conjunctive form (連用形)
  of verbs, it takes on the nuance of "for (A) to be possible" or "able to (A)". When combined with ない,
  this meaning shifts to "unable to (A)" or "cannot (A)". Compared to できない, which means the potential
  to do something does not exist, 得ない suggests "there is no possibility that (A) can be done" or "the
  possibility to do (A) has not been gained". **Important consideration**: 得る can be read as either *eru*
  or *uru*. While *uru* is an older form mainly found in literature and rarely spoken, it''s crucial to
  note that *uru* is never used in the negative form with ない. It''s also worth noting that 得る is significantly
  more formal and bookish than できる. However, certain set phrases using this grammar point, such as あり得る
  ("possible") and あり得ない ("impossible"), are very common in everyday speech.'
