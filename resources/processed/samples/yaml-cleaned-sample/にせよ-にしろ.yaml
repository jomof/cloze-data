writeup: にせよ and にしろ are two phrases that are often translated as "even if (A)", or "no matter if (A)".
  This structure is a combination of に, and either of the imperative forms of する; せよ, or しろ. **せよ tends
  to be more common in written material, while しろ is more common in speech.** Despite the English translations,
  this particular use of the imperative form of する translates more accurately to something like "so it's
  (A), who cares!", as the speaker is strongly stating that the actual condition of (A) is unimportant
  in relation to what they want to say. にせよ and にしろ can appear following verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives
  or nouns in their plain forms. As this structure is fairly direct, it's generally used to emphasize
  that regardless of what the case is for (A), (B) is still true, or is the more important matter to consider.
