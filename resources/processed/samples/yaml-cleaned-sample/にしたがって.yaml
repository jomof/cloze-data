writeup: The grammar point 「にしたがって」 combines the particle 「に」 with the te-form of the verb 「従う（したがう）」,

  with it. It signifies that (B) occurs as a natural consequence or in proportion to (A). This structure
  is quite **formal**, often used in situations involving rules, instructions, or general trends. 「にしたがって」
