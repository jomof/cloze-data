writeup: |-
  **なさい** is the polite imperative form of the honorific verb **なさる**, which specifically highlights and respects the actions of another person (never the speaker). Despite being respectful, the fact that this is a command means that it would never be used toward a superior. Due to this, **なさい** is most frequently used toward peers or people of lower status, like children. To use **なさい**, simply connect it to the ます-stem of a verb. **なさい** may be shortened further to **な**, which becomes an even more casual form that is used most frequently toward peers.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Be careful not to confuse **な** (the particle) and **な** (the shortened form of **なさい**). **な** (meaning "don't") will always be used with the dictionary form of a verb, while **な** (meaning "please do") will always be used with the ます-stem of a verb.
