writeup: |-
  「であれ〜であれ」 is used to express that **regardless of two possibilities**, the outcome or situation remains the same. It essentially means "whether A or B". Think of it like saying "no matter if it's this or that, the result is still the same".

  *  **であれ** is the imperative form of である (the polite form of the copula だ). Here, the imperative doesn't carry a command meaning, but rather a sense of acceptance or concession.
  *  Using it twice emphasizes the **invariance** despite the different options.

  It often appears in more formal contexts and with nouns. The two options presented by 「〜であれ〜であれ」 typically belong to the same broad category to maintain logical coherence. For instance, you might compare two types of art or two different statuses of a person.
examples:
  - japanese: 子供であれ大人であれ、入場料は4000円です。
    english: Whether you're a child or an adult, the entrance fee is 4000 yen.

    nuance: The sentence uses 「であれ」 twice to present two distinct categories, 「子供」 and 「大人」, emphasizing
      that the 「入場料」 remains constant regardless of age.

      due to the 「同じ機械」.
