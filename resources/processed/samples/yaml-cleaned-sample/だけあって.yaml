writeup: |-
  Like **だけに**, `だけあって` is a phrase that is used to show that something is "only natural for (A)", or "as might be expected of (A)". This structure includes the particle `だけ` "just", or "only", and the て-form of the う-Verb `ある` "to be". In this way, the more literal meaning may be interpreted as "just being (A), (B)", and implies that the innate trait or traits of (A) led to the expected positive result of (B). `だけあって` will only be used when the expected result is something that is positive in relation to (A).

  Like most other grammar patterns that begin with `だけ`, this structure may be used with verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives followed by `な`, or nouns.

  **Caution** - As `だけあって` emphasizes an innate or constant quality of (A), it will not be used for things that are not obvious, or have not yet happened. This means that `だけあって` will not appear in sentences discussing things that may happen in the future, and will also not often be utilized with phrases such as `だろう`, `でしょう`, `かもしれない`, or similar structures that express uncertainty.

    kind: synonym

  - term: だけに
    meaning: As might be expected, Because, All the more because, It's only natural
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「だけに」 is very similar to 「だけあって」 but can sometimes carry a stronger nuance of "all the more
      because" and can be used in a wider range of contexts, though not with negative results.
  - term: だけのことはある
    meaning: No wonder, Not surprising that, As expected
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「だけのことはある」 is used after experiencing something and realizing it lives up to its reputation.
      It has a stronger sense of confirmation after the fact compared to the anticipation implied by 「だけあって」.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「だけで」、「だけに」、and 「だけのことはある」 share similarities with 「だけあって」, they have
  distinct nuances. 「だけで」 focuses on the means or condition. 「だけに」 is broader and can express "all the
  more because". 「だけのことはある」 is used after the fact to express that something lived up to expectations.
  Pay attention to these subtle differences to use the most appropriate expression.
