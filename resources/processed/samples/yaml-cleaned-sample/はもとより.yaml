  は元より, commonly seen purely in hiragana, is a grammar pattern that indicates "not only (A), but also (B) ", or "let alone (A), (B)". This construction is just a combination of は, the noun 元 'origin', and より. In this way, it is highlighting that "even compared to the original fact of (A), (B)". Often, (A) will be something that is considered obvious, or the most well known information in regard to the topic.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  はもとより may appear after nouns, or verb phrases that have been nominalized with の or こと.
  *  Alternatively, はもとより may be used in structures where it is simply showing that (A) is the base from which (B) is also a fact. Although this may sound similar to the previous meaning, it translates closer to "from the start, (A) is (B)", or "by nature, (A) is (B)". Which meaning is being used will usually be clear in the context of the overall sentence.

post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share the core meaning of 'not only... but also',
  there are subtle differences in nuance and formality. 「はもとより」 tends to be more formal and emphasizes
  that the first point is a given or obvious. 「はもちろん」 is similar but can be slightly less formal. 「だけでなく(て)～も」
  and 「ばかりでなく」 are more versatile and can be used in a wider range of situations. 「のみならず」 is also formal
  but sometimes emphasizes the added information more strongly. 「に限らず」 highlights that something is not
  limited to a specific case.
