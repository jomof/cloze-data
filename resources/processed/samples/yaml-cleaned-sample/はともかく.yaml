writeup: 'はともかく is an expression which makes use of the adverbial-particle は, and the adverb 兎も角 meaning
  "to set aside", or "at any rate". This structure is used when the speaker wants to shift the focus from
  topic (A) to topic (B), or to introduce (B) as an additional point. はともかく generally follows nouns in
  their dictionary forms. Often, (A) is something the speaker considers less important or not worth dwelling
  on compared to (B). An interesting tidbit: the adverb 兎も角 is believed to originate from the Buddhist
  phrase 兎角亀毛 (とかくきもう), meaning "horns on rabbits, fur on turtles," referring to nonexistent things. While
  the direct connection to the modern meaning of 兎も角 is debated, a parallel can be drawn to English phrases
  like "(A) is neither here nor there," implying something is insignificant or irrelevant.'

  differs. 「はともかく」 tends to downplay the importance of the first topic relative to the second. 「は別として」
  suggests a more distinct separation. 「はさておき」 is often used to smoothly transition to a new topic. 「以外」
  and 「を除いて」 focus on excluding something, whereas 「はともかく」 includes the initial element but emphasizes
  another. Pay attention to the context to choose the most appropriate expression.
