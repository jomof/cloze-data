  The grammar point **ところだった** combined with the dictionary form of a verb indicates that someone **almost did something** or **was in the process of doing something** when an unexpected event occurred.

  It conveys the idea that a certain outcome was narrowly avoided or that an action was interrupted. Often, it implies a sense of relief at averting a negative consequence or regret at not being able to complete the intended action.

  Since **ところだった** combines **ところ** (place) and the past tense of **だ** (to be), **だった**, it emphasizes being in the situation or at the point of doing something before a change occurred.

  When expressing that a positive outcome was nearly missed, **のに** often follows **ところだった**, translating to "even though I was just about to... (something good), (something else happened)".

post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, **ところだった** highlights the immediacy and near-completion
  of an action before something else happened. The nuance of narrowly avoiding a negative outcome is particularly
  evident when paired with adverbs like **危うく** (almost) or phrases like **〜ば** (if...). Conversely, it
  can also express being interrupted mid-action, as in the example about adjusting the hot water temperature.

  - term: ところだった ①
    meaning: Almost, Nearly, About to, On the verge of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Focuses on the imminence of an event, often without the implication of interruption or narrowly
      avoiding something.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both **ところだった ①** and **ところだった ②** indicate being close to doing something,
  the second form often carries a stronger sense of something else happening that prevented the action
  or interrupted it. **ところだった ①** is a more general expression of being on the verge of something, whereas
  **ところだった ②** frequently implies a sense of 'but then...'. Think of **ところだった ②** as emphasizing the shift
  from the brink of an action to a different reality due to an intervening event.
