etymology: The noun 「甲斐(かい)」 originally referred to the result or effect of an action, particularly in
  the context of difficult or challenging tasks. The verb 「ある(aru)」 means "to exist" or "to be." Thus,
  「甲斐がある」 literally means "the result/effect exists," implying that the effort was meaningful and productive.
writeup: |-
  「甲斐(かい)がある」, where 「甲斐」 is a noun meaning "worth" or "effect," is used to express that something was or will be worth doing. It indicates that the effort put into something will yield a positive and meaningful result. This grammar point is often written in hiragana as 「かい」 or 「がい」, depending on the conjugation with the preceding word.

  The basic meaning is that the "worth of (A) exists." When following verbs, 「がい」 is often used after the ます-stem, while 「かい」 can follow any standard form. The subtle difference lies in emphasis: 「かい」 often highlights the tense of the verb, while 「がい」 has a nuance of something being perpetually worthwhile.

  When paired with nouns, 「の」 is required before 「甲斐がある」. The opposite, 「甲斐がない」, signifies that something is *not* worth doing. This expression is commonly used when the speaker wants to convey that a positive outcome will result from something difficult or unpleasant.
