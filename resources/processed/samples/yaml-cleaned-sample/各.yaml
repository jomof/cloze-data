  The prefix **各 (kaku)** is used to indicate "each" or "every" in a slightly more formal way. While there isn't a strict rule, it's most commonly used with words of Chinese origin (kanji compounds) or katakana words. It signifies that something applies to every item in a group or category.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While 各 means "each," it's generally **not used** with units of time like days, weeks, or months. For time units, expressions like 毎日 (mainichi - every day) or 毎週 (maishuu - every week) are more natural.
  *  The most common use of 各 is to identify things that are part of a sequence or collection, such as:
  *  Each stop on a train line
  *  Each page in a book
  *  Each floor in a building
  *  Each house on a street

  **Fun Fact:** The kanji 各 is also used in the word **各々 (onoono)**, which also means "each" or "respectively," but primarily refers to individual people.
