writeup: |-
  「ので」 is a Japanese conjunctive particle. It connects two parts of a sentence logically, indicating a reason or cause. Similar to 「から」, it often translates to "because" or "since." When attaching to な-adjectives or nouns, you must use 「な」 before 「ので」. When used as "since," 「ので」 emphasizes the overall situation or the resulting effects and presents the reasons objectively (based on facts rather than personal feelings). 「から」 tends to be more subjective and can sound weaker or more vague when used as "because." 「から」's basic meaning is "from," which makes it less directly causal than 「ので」.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  「ので」 can sometimes be heard as the more casual 「んで」.
  *  Unlike many other particles connecting to verbs, 「ので」 can be used with the ます-form. This is a distinctive feature of conjunctive particles.

post_example_writeup: Remember that 「ので」 is generally considered more polite and objective than 「から」.
  It's often used when giving reasons in a more formal or less assertive way. It's also used when the
  speaker wants to provide an explanation without sounding like they are making excuses.

      whereas 「ので」 is generally not used for those.
  - term: なぜなら〜から
    meaning: Because, The reason is, That is because
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「なぜなら〜から」 is a more formal way of explicitly stating the reason. It's stronger and more emphatic
      than 「ので」.
  - term: ものだから
    meaning: Because, The reason is
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ものだから」 often carries a nuance of making an excuse or providing a justification for something,
      which is slightly different from the more neutral 「ので」.
  - term: ものですから・もので
    meaning: Because, My excuse is, My explanation is
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「ものだから」, 「ものですから」 and 「もので」 are used when offering an explanation that may sound

  - term: もの・もん
    meaning: Because, Cause

    nuance: 「もの」 and 「もん」 are very casual ways to express "because." They are often used in informal speech
      and can sound a bit childish or self-justifying compared to 「ので」.
  - term: し～し
    meaning: And, Giving reasons

    nuance: 「し～し」 is used to list multiple reasons. While it expresses causality, it's different from
      「ので」 which focuses on a single primary reason.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「ので」 is a relatively neutral way to state
  a reason, often implying a natural consequence. 「から」 is more direct and can be used in a wider range
  of situations, including giving commands. The various forms of 「もの」 emphasize explanation or excuse.
  「なぜなら〜から」 is for explicitly stating a reason. 「し～し」 lists multiple reasons rather than focusing on one.
  Pay attention to the formality and nuance you want to convey when choosing between these expressions.
