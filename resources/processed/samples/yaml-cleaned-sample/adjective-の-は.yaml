writeup: 'The particle の can function as a nominalizer, turning an adjective into a noun. It essentially
  means "the one that is [adjective]". When used with な-adjectives, remember to include な before の. Following
  の, you''ll often see particles like は, が, or も, depending on the sentence''s focus. **Important**: の
  can appear multiple times in a sentence referring to the same noun.'

  - term: の (possession)
    meaning: Possessive particle

    nuance: Unlike 「Adjective + の(は)」 which nominalizes an adjective, the possessive particle 「の」 indicates
      ownership or affiliation, like 「私の本」(my book).
  - term: Particle + の
    meaning: Explanatory 「の」
    kind: grammatical particle
    nuance: This 「の」 is used at the end of sentences to seek explanation or express a reason, unlike 「Adjective
      + の(は)」 which functions as a nominalizer. For example, 「暑いので、窓を開けてください」(It's hot, so please open
      the window).
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse the nominalizing の with the possessive particle
  の or the explanatory の at the end of sentences. The nominalizing の turns an adjective into a noun phrase,
  while the possessive の shows ownership, and the sentence-ending の seeks explanation or states a reason.
