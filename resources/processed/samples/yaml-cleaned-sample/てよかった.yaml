writeup: The grammar point 「てよかった」 expresses a feeling of relief or satisfaction about a past event. It
  translates to "I'm glad that..." or "It's a good thing that...". It is formed by attaching 「よかった」, the
  past tense of the い-adjective 「いい」 (good), to the て-form of a verb. The negative form can be expressed
  as 「なくてよかった」 or the more casual 「ないでよかった」, meaning "I'm glad that I didn't..." or "It's a good thing
  I didn't...". While both negative forms convey the same meaning, **「ないでよかった」 is more commonly used in
  everyday conversation**, whereas **「なくてよかった」 often appears in writing or more formal settings** and
  can sound a bit old-fashioned.
