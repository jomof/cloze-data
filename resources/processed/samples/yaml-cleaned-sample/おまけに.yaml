writeup: 「おまけに」 is used to add another point that reinforces the previous statement. It's similar to saying
  "in addition" or "on top of that" in English. The key nuance is that the second point, introduced by
  「おまけに」, is often seen as an extra, almost like a bonus (or a negative bonus, when things are bad). Think
  of 「おまけ」 as an extra item you get when you buy something. 「おまけに」 extends this idea to conversation,
  indicating that the second point is an 'extra' on top of the first. Importantly, both the initial statement
  and the point introduced by 「おまけに」 will generally share the same positive or negative sentiment. You
  wouldn't use 「おまけに」 to connect a good thing with a bad thing.

      and to make it worse, I upset one of our clients.
    register: casual

  - term: その上
    meaning: Besides, In addition, Furthermore

    kind: synonym

    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「上に」 often implies a hierarchical addition, where the second point builds upon the first.

post_false_friends_writeup: While 「おまけに」, 「しかも」, 「その上」, 「それに」, and 「上に」 can all be used to add information,
  the subtle differences in nuance are important. 「おまけに」 carries the specific feeling of the second point
  being an extra, like a bonus. 「しかも」 is a straightforward addition. 「その上」 is more formal. 「それに」 is a
  general additive conjunction. 「上に」 suggests a building upon the previous point.
