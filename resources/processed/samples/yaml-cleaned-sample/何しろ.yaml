writeup: Although a combination of the substitute noun 何 and the imperative form of する, しろ, 何しろ is often
  considered to be a singular adverb that carries the meaning of "no wonder" or "after all." A more literal
  interpretation might be "whatever the case, (A)," expressing that under any circumstance, only one conclusion
  can be accurately drawn regarding (A). 何しろ frequently appears at the beginning of a sentence or the
  start of the second clause. It is often paired with statements including words like から or ので to emphasize
  an explanation or reason for why (A) is the way it is.
