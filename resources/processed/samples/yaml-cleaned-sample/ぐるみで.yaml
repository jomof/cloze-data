writeup: The suffix ぐるみ, when attached to a noun, signifies "including all of," "all over," or "-wide."
  It expresses that something encompasses absolutely the entirety of the preceding noun. The term ぐるみ
  stems from the verb 包む (tsutsumu), meaning "to wrap" or "to encompass." Frequently, the particle で follows
  ぐるみ, indicating "with," but の can also be used before another noun. ぐるみ is commonly used with words
  denoting a whole group or span, where the sentence's topic is a part of that whole. This could refer
  to a family member, a house in a neighborhood, a student in a school, or other elements sharing a clear
  connection. The core nuance is that the entire group shares a common characteristic, rather than emphasizing
  individual components.
