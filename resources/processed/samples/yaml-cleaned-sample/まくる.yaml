writeup: 「まくる」 is a verb suffix that attaches to the conjunctive form (ます-stem) of other verbs to indicate
  that an action is performed repeatedly, excessively, or with great enthusiasm. It conveys a sense of
  doing something "like crazy," "non-stop," or "without thinking." The nuance often implies a lack of
  restraint or consideration for consequences. The origin of 「まくる」 comes from the verb 「捲る」(めくる), meaning
  "to roll up" or "to turn over," suggesting a repetitive or cyclical action. **Important Considerations:**
  The verb to which 「まくる」 is attached must be volitional, meaning it's an action the subject can consciously
  control.
