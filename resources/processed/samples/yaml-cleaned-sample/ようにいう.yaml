writeup: ようにいう is an expression that combines the auxiliary verb ようだ with the verb 言う. The particle に
  converts ようだ into its adverbial form, ように. This grammar point indicates that something is being said
  in a manner that aims to instigate a particular action or state. Therefore, ようにいう is generally translated
  as "to tell (someone to do something)", "to request", or "to order". When the nuance is closer to a
  request, the verb 頼む (to request) can be used in place of 言う. Similarly, for a stronger sense of command,
  命じる (to order) can be substituted. However, 言う itself is versatile and, depending on the speaker's tone
  and the context, can imply either a request or an order.

      can be flirty. The phrase 「淹れるように言われた」 is used playfully, creating a lighthearted and inviting atmosphere
      on a first date. The passive voice here softens the implied intention of wanting the listener closer
      for a more intimate setting.
  - japanese: あの、もしよかったら、連絡先を教えていただけないでしょうか?またお会いするように言われた気がしたので。
    english: Um, if you don't mind, could I get your contact information? I felt like I was told (by fate)
      that we should meet again.
    conjugation: passive
    register: polite
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「あの」 and 「～いただけないでしょうか」 makes the request very polite. 「またお会いするように言われた気がした」 is

false_friends:
  - term: ように～てほしい
    meaning: Want ~ to ~ like ~, Want ~ to be able to ~, Want ~ to ~ in the way of ~
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both 「ようにいう」 and 「ように～てほしい」 express a desired action, 「ようにいう」 focuses on the act of
      telling, requesting, or ordering, whereas 「ように～てほしい」 expresses the speaker's desire for someone
      else to perform the action.
  - term: ように
    meaning: So that, In order to, In such a way that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ように」 on its own expresses purpose or manner. 「ようにいう」 specifically adds the component of verbal
      communication to convey the desired manner or outcome.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「ようにいう」 always involves someone instructing
  or requesting another person to do something. 「ように」 on its own is broader and can describe the manner
  of an action or express a purpose. 「ように～てほしい」 focuses on the speaker's desire, not necessarily the act
  of communicating that desire to someone else.
