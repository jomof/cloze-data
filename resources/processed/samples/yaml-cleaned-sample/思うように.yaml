  「思うように」 is a common sentence pattern in Japanese used to describe situations that either do or do not go as planned or expected. It can be translated as "as one hopes," "as desired," or "as one thought."

  Etymologically, 「思うように」 is a combination of the verb 「思う (omou)」 (to think or feel) and the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb 「ようだ (you da)」, which expresses resemblance or similarity. The 「ように (you ni)」 form functions adverbially, modifying the verb and indicating the manner in which something occurs.

  Typically, sentences using this pattern follow a structure where an initial phrase (A) sets up an expectation, followed by 「思うように」, and then a final phrase (B) indicates the actual outcome. If (B) is a simple noun, 「ような (you na)」 is used instead. The (B) part of the sentence reveals whether the expectation from (A) was met, exceeded, or not met at all, allowing for both positive and negative expressions.
etymology: 「思うように」 consists of 「思う(omou)」, meaning 'to think' or 'to feel,' and 「ように(you ni)」, the conjunctive
  form of the auxiliary verb 「ようだ(you da)」, which signifies 'like' or 'similar to.' Together, they create
  an adverbial phrase indicating that something happens in a way that is similar to what one thinks or
  desires.
