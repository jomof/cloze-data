  「始末だ」 is used to describe a negative final result or outcome, often after a series of undesirable events. The noun 始末 (しまつ) means "settlement" or "end result." This grammar point emphasizes the unfortunate or undesirable nature of the conclusion. It's often translated as "to wind up as (A)," "to end up as (A)," or "to come about that (A)." It is typically used after verbs in their dictionary form.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  「始末だ」 frequently appears with adverbs like とうとう (finally), 挙げ句 (after a long process), or 結局 (in the end). While seemingly redundant, these adverbs strengthen the emphasis on the progression towards the negative outcome. 「始末だ」 highlights the culmination of events leading to the negative result, making it more emphatic than just stating the final outcome.
examples:
  - japanese: あんだけダブルチェックをするように言ったのに、この始末だ。
    english: Despite telling him so many times to double-check, this is the result.
    register: casual
    setting: frustrated
    nuance: The use of 「あんだけ」 implies a significant amount of repetition and frustration from the speaker.
      「この始末だ」 directly points to the undesirable outcome.
  - japanese: みんなで祭りに行くつもりだったのに、みんながドタキャンするから、結局一人で行く始末だ。
    english: We were supposed to go to the festival together, but because everyone canceled suddenly,
      I ended up going alone in the end.
    register: casual
    setting: disappointed
    nuance: 「みんながドタキャンするから」 explains the reason for the negative outcome. 「結局」 reinforces the sense of
      finality and disappointment leading to 「一人で行く始末だ」.
  - japanese: その客は店中をぐちゃぐちゃにしたあげく、何も買わないで帰る始末だ。
    english: After messing up the whole store, that customer ended up leaving without buying anything.
    register: casual

    nuance: 「店中をぐちゃぐちゃにしたあげく」 describes the lengthy and undesirable process leading to the final negative
      outcome expressed by 「何も買わないで帰る始末だ」.
  - japanese: 武田さんは小さな声で職場でハラスメントを受けたことを伝えてきて、しまいに大きな声で泣き出す始末だ。

    register: semi-formal
    setting: sympathetic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「小さな声で...伝えてきて」 contrasts with 「しまいに大きな声で泣き出す始末だ」, highlighting the worsening situation. 「しまいに」
      emphasizes the final, unfortunate result.
    etymology: 「始末」 here signifies the culmination of a distressing situation.
  - japanese: あいつは、自分が起こしたミスなのに、謝るどころか私のせいにする始末だ。
    english: Even though it was a mistake that he had made, far from apologizing, he ended up blaming
      me!
    register: casual
    setting: indignant
    nuance: 「謝るどころか」 emphasizes the unexpected and negative action taken instead of an apology, leading
      to the unacceptable outcome described by 「私のせいにする始末だ」.
  - japanese: せっかく友達と海へ行く計画を立てたのに、田中は大事な用があって行けないとか、武田もシフトが入ってたとかで、結局私一人だけで行く始末だ。
    english: Even though I went out of my way to plan this trip to the beach with friends, Tanaka said
      that he had something important to do and couldn't go, while Takeda said that he had a shift. So
      I ended up going all by myself.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: The phrase 「せっかく...のに」 expresses disappointment that the carefully made plans fell apart,
      culminating in the speaker having to go alone, described by 「私一人だけで行く始末だ」.
  - japanese: 武田「山田さん、顔色が悪いですけど・・・」山田「夜遅くまでゲームをしていたので、おかげでこの始末だ。」
    english: 'Takeda: "Yamada-san, you don''t look so good..." Yamada: "I was playing video games until
      late at night, so this is the result, thanks to that."'
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Yamada's response 「夜遅くまでゲームをしていたので、おかげでこの始末だ」 directly links his late-night gaming to his
      current poor condition, using 「始末だ」 to point out the negative consequence.
    etymology: 「おかげで」 is used sarcastically here, highlighting the self-inflicted nature of the negative
      outcome.
  - japanese: 田中には二度と仕事は頼まないぞ。納期は守らないし仕上がりも悪かったのに、言い訳ばかりならべて。最後には追加の料金を払えと言い出す始末だ。
    english: I'll never ask Tanaka to work for me again. He can't meet deadlines, his workmanship is poor,
      and he does nothing but make excuses. In the end, he even demanded I pay an additional fee.
    register: casual
    setting: angry
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The sentence lists a series of negative actions by Tanaka, culminating in the particularly
      egregious demand for extra payment, expressed with 「追加の料金を払えと言い出す始末だ」. 「～ぞ」 is a masculine sentence
      ending expressing strong feeling.
post_example_writeup: 「始末だ」 inherently carries a negative connotation. It's used when the final outcome
  is undesirable or problematic, often due to a series of preceding negative events or poor choices. Think
  of it as the unfortunate bottom line of a bad situation.
