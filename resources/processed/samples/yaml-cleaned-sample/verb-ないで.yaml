writeup: '**ないで** is a casual way to say "please don''t do (something)". It''s less formal than **ないでください**.
  You can use it when talking to people you are close to, like family or friends. Think of it as a softer
  command or a gentle request. It directly attaches to the negative stem of a verb. The sentence often
  ends with **ないで** itself, emphasizing the request not to perform the action.'

  - term: ないで
    meaning: Without doing, Not ~ and ~

    nuance: Unlike the request form of **ないで**, which stands alone, the 'without doing' form connects
      two parts of a sentence, describing an action done without another action.

  sentence or a direct request, it usually means 'please don't'. If it connects two clauses, it likely
  means 'without doing'.
