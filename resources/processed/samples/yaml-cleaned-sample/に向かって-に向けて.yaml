  「に向かって」 and 「に向けて」 both indicate movement or direction **towards** a specific point or goal. They are often interchangeable, but there are subtle differences.

  **に向かって** generally emphasizes the physical direction or orientation. It literally means "facing towards" and is used when something is physically directed at something else. Think of pointing, shouting, or moving in the direction of something.

  **に向けて** tends to emphasize the **purpose** or **goal** of an action. It suggests that efforts are being made in preparation for something or are directed at achieving a specific outcome. This can be a future event, a target audience, or a desired state.

  * **Interchangeability:** In many cases, you can use either 「に向かって」 or 「に向けて」 without a significant change in meaning, especially when referring to physical direction.
  * **Focus on Physical Direction (に向かって):** This emphasizes the act of facing or moving in a specific direction.
  * **Focus on Purpose or Goal (に向けて):** This highlights the aim or target of an action or effort.
  * **向ける (transitive verb):** This verb form implies intentionally directing something towards a target, often with the aim of making it suitable for that target.

  - term: へ
    meaning: To, Toward
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「に向かって・に向けて」, 「へ」 is a basic directional particle that doesn't carry the same nuance
      of facing or aiming. It simply indicates movement in a certain direction.
  - term: 向け
    meaning: Intended for, Aimed at
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to 「に向けて」, 「向け」 is often used as a suffix attached to nouns to indicate something
      is specifically designed or intended for a particular group or purpose (e.g., 子供向け - for children).
  - term: 向き
    meaning: Suitable for, Facing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「向き」 can mean 'suitable for' or 'facing'. When it means 'facing', it describes a state of
      being positioned in a direction, not necessarily an action directed towards it like 「に向かって」.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「へ」 is the most general directional particle.
  「向け」 is often used as a suffix to describe suitability or intended audience. 「向き」 can describe a state
  of being positioned or its suitability. 「に向かって」 and 「に向けて」 both imply a directed action or intention,
  with 「に向かって」 emphasizing the physical direction and 「に向けて」 the purpose or goal.
