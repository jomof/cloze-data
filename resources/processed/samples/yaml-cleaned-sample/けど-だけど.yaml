  **けど** is a conjunctive particle in Japanese, similar to **が**, used to connect two parts of a sentence, often indicating contrast or a slight reservation. It conveys the idea of 'while thinking about A, B'. In English, it's often translated as "but" or "however."

  Just like with other grammatical elements, when **けど** follows a な-adjective or a noun, the copula **だ** is usually required, resulting in **だけど**.

  **けど** is the casual form of **けれども**. Here's a spectrum from casual to formal:

  Casual: けど
  Less Casual: けども
  Slightly Formal: けれど
  Formal: けれども
  More Formal: が
  Most Formal: Formal Conjunctions (e.g., しかし)

  **Important Consideration:**
  Sometimes, the phrase following **けど** is omitted if it's obvious from the context or if the speaker chooses not to state it explicitly.
examples:
  - japanese: パソコンはないけど、大丈夫?
    english: I don't have a computer, but is that okay?
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The speaker is stating a fact 「パソコンはない」 and then asking for confirmation or understanding
      「大丈夫?」 in a casual manner, suitable for friends.

      The use of 「かな」 adds a touch of uncertainty or self-reflection.
