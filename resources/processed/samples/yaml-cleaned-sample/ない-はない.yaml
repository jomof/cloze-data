writeup: ～ない～はない is a grammatical construction in Japanese that uses a **double negative** to create an
  affirmative meaning. It literally translates to "there is no ~ that is not/does not." This pattern emphasizes
  that something is **universally true** or that there are **no exceptions**. The first 「ない」 negates the
  noun or concept preceding it, while the second 「ない」 negates the verb or adjective that follows. Think
  of it as eliminating the possibility of something *not* being the case. For example, 「彼には弾けない曲はない (kare
  ni wa hikenai kyoku wa nai)」 literally means "There is no song that he cannot play," which implies he
  can play all songs. Be careful not to confuse this with similar patterns like 「なくはない (naku wa nai)」
  which expresses a weaker affirmation.
