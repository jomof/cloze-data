writeup: 「に代わって」 is used to indicate that someone or something is doing something **in place of** another
  person or thing, or **on behalf of** them. It can also mean that something is **succeeding** or **replacing**
  something else. It attaches directly to nouns. 「に」 functions as a location marker here, indicating a
  shift in position, and 「代わる」 means "to substitute". Therefore, 「に代わって」 literally means "having substituted
  [something/someone] at the location [of another something/someone]". The form 「に代わり」 can also be used
  as a more formal conjunctive.

  - term: 代わりに
    meaning: Instead of, In place of, In exchange for
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「に代わって」 and 「代わりに」 are often interchangeable, 「代わりに」 can also imply an exchange or compensation,
      whereas 「に代わって」 focuses more on the substitution of a role or function.
post_false_friends_writeup: Both 「に代わって」 and 「代わりに」 can mean 'instead of' or 'in place of'. However, 「代わりに」
  can also carry the nuance of 'in exchange for' or 'as a substitute'. If the focus is purely on one person
  or thing taking over the role or function of another, 「に代わって」 is often more appropriate. When there's
  an implied exchange or giving something in return, 「代わりに」 might be a better fit. For many everyday situations,
  either can be used.
