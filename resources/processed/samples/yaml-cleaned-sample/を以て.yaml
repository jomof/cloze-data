writeup: |-
  をもって is a formal grammar pattern stemming from the meaning of its kanji counterpart 以て "by means of". It functions similarly to the case-marking particle で, translating to "with (A)", "by (A)", "via (A)", or "by means of (A)". As this structure is preceded by the particle を, it directly follows nouns or noun phrases.

  While semantically similar to で, **をもって is generally not used for simple methods**, such as "traveling by train." The translation "by means of" is often the most fitting, as it emphasizes the means, especially in formal contexts. It's also **more commonly used with abstract concepts** like "with sincerity" or "with compassion" rather than concrete objects like a fork or hammer.

  **Fun Fact:** The pattern もってすれば is a common idiom, translating to "assuming it were with (A)" or "given (A)".
