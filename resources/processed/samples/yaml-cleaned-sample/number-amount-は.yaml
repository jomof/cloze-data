  The は particle has two primary functions. The first is to mark the topic of a sentence, as learned very early in our Japanese language journey. However, the second common usage of は is to highlight **contrast** (making a comparison). When は is used after a number/counter, it regularly has this comparison meaning. This can be translated as "or so", or "at least". Before は, the counter is regularly followed by くらい (or ぐらい). This just softens the statement, and further highlights the "or so" meaning.

  Despite being translated as "at least", the comparative meaning of は itself is what creates the nuance of this grammar structure. The thing before は is being highlighted as an amount, while also implying that there are other amounts. This implication of another amount makes は sound as if it could mean "as opposed to (B)". So in essence, this grammar structure sounds like "As for (A), as opposed to (B)", where (B) is not usually mentioned.

false_friends:
  - term: は
    meaning: As for... (Highlights sentence topic)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「Number/Amount + は」, which implies a comparison and translates to 'at least' or 'or
      so', the topic marking は simply indicates the subject being discussed. For example, 「私は学生です。」 (As
      for me, I am a student.) focuses on the speaker as the topic, without any comparative nuance about
      the number of students.
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse the contrastive 「は」 used with numbers/amounts with
  the topic-marking 「は」. While both are pronounced "wa", the context will usually make it clear which
  one is being used. If 「は」 follows a number or counter, it's highly likely it's being used in its contrastive
  sense, meaning "at least" or "or so".
