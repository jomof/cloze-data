etymology: The phrase より (yori) means "than" when comparing two items. の (no) is a possessive particle,
  and ほうが (hou ga) translates to "the side of," "the direction of," or, in this context, "the one that
  is more." Thus, the entire phrase より～のほうが literally means "the side of ~ is more ~ than."
writeup: |-
  より～のほうが can be thought of as similar to たほうがいい and ないほうがいい, in that it expresses that one thing is the "better (A)" or "more (A)." However, unlike ほうがいい-based expressions, any pair of adjectives, verbs, or nouns may be compared in this construction, so long as のほうが is followed by an adjective.

  より translates roughly to "than" or "rather than" in this phrase.

  From the examples, we can see that より will always appear after the word that has the lesser extent of (A) when used together with のほうが.

  **Important Considerations**

  When より is used by itself, or when it is not linked directly to the previous word, it can seem like it has the opposite meaning. However, in these cases, のほうが just remains unsaid.

  For example, because the より is after が, not before これ, it is easy to assume that これ is the thing that is lesser. However, this が behaves in the same way as のほうが, meaning that これ itself is the more expensive thing, with より just being used like "relatively" (compared to many other things).

  Although の方が is the most common construction, the particle を may sometimes replace が. This is especially true when used with markers of desire such as たい and ほしい. The primary difference between these two is that が emphasizes what a person wants or wants to do (the whole statement), while を emphasizes the item or action itself (regardless of the rest of the statement). With たい, both を and が will sound completely natural. However, with ほしい, が will be more natural, while を is accepted.

  This use of ほしい only applies to wanting items, as opposed to たい, which indicates the desire to 'do' something.
