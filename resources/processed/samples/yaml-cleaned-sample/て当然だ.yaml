writeup: 「て当然だ」 is a commonly used expression which indicates that "(A) is natural", or "(A) is a matter
  of course". This is a combination of the て-form of either verbs or い-Adjectives (using 「で」 when used
  with nouns), the noun 「当然」 ("naturally"), and 「だ」. 「て当然だ」 is a fairly strong phrase and is often used
  when pointing out things that the speaker considers to be obvious facts.

  or na-adjectives, 「で」 precedes 「当然だ」. The level of formality can be adjusted by changing 「だ」 to 「です」.

  - term: のも当然だ
    meaning: It is only natural that, It is no wonder
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「て当然だ」 states something is a matter of course, 「のも当然だ」 often implies a sense of acceptance
      or acknowledgment of a natural outcome. Both are very similar in meaning, but 「のも当然だ」 can sometimes
      feel slightly more nuanced in expressing acceptance of a consequence.

    meaning: May well, Have or has good reason for, No wonder, … Is only natural
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「のも当然だ」, 「のももっともだ」 expresses that something is natural, but it often carries a
      stronger sense of justification or reason. It implies that there are valid grounds for the situation
      being the way it is.
post_false_friends_writeup: 「て当然だ」、「のも当然だ」、and 「のももっともだ」 are all used to express that something is natural
  or to be expected. While they are often interchangeable, 「のももっともだ」 tends to emphasize the reasons behind
  why something is natural, and 「のも当然だ」 can sometimes carry a slightly stronger nuance of acceptance.
  「て当然だ」 is a more direct and straightforward expression of something being a matter of course.
