writeup: '**そんなに** is a common adverbial expression used to indicate a degree or extent that is similar
  to something already mentioned or understood in the context. It conveys the idea of "so much", "that
  much", or "like that". Think of it as highlighting the *degree* to which something is true. Because
  **そんなに** is part of the *kosoado* series (こそあど言葉), you can also use **こんなに** (this much), **あんなに** (that
  much over there), and **どんなに** (how much). However, **そんなに** is particularly frequent in everyday conversation,
  often functioning almost as a set phrase. It modifies verbs, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives, appearing
  directly before them. A literal interpretation could be "to an extent like that", where **に** indicates
  the target or extent.'
