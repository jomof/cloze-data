  **お～ください** is an honorific language expression in Japanese, used similarly to **なさい**. It's the imperative form of **くださる**, which is the honorific equivalent of **くれる**. It conveys the meaning of "please do (A) for me." **お～ください** is more polite than **なさい** and can be used when making requests to almost anyone, regardless of their status relative to the speaker.

  **Important Consideration:** **ご～ください** is only used as part of humble speech expressions like **ご～する** (or **お～する**). In those cases, it becomes **ご～してください**.
