writeup: お～ください is an **honorific language** expression in Japanese, used similarly to なさい. It's the **imperative
  form** of くださる, the honorific equivalent of くれる. It conveys "please do (A) for me." お～ください is **more
  polite** than なさい and can be used to make requests to almost anyone, regardless of their status relative
  to yours. Be aware that ご～ください is typically used as part of the **humble speech** expression ご～する (or
  お～する). In these cases, it becomes ご～してください.
