  The grammar point **を契機に (o keiki ni)** is a formal expression used to indicate that a particular event or situation serves as a **trigger**, **turning point**, or **opportunity** for something else to happen. It can be translated as "lead to," "as a good opportunity to," "as a result of," or "as a trigger." The noun before を契機に is typically a significant event, either positive or negative, that has broad implications. This could be a major life event or a significant historical or current event.

  **Key points:**

  *  It follows nouns or nominalized verbs (using の or こと).
  *  Similar expressions like **にして** or **として** can replace に without changing the meaning.
  *  It emphasizes a **significant turning point** or **critical juncture**, making it less suitable for trivial events.

  **Important Consideration:**

  *  Be careful not to confuse を契機に with をきっかけに. While both indicate a trigger, **を契機に** emphasizes a more significant and impactful event, often marking a turning point. Using を契機に for minor events can sound unnatural.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up を契機に with similar expressions, focus on the **significance
  of the trigger event**. If the event is a major turning point or has substantial consequences, を契機に
  is likely appropriate. For less significant triggers, をきっかけに might be a better fit. Remember that をいいことに
  has a negative nuance of exploitation, and に伴って/に伴い indicates a closer, often simultaneous, relationship
  between events.
