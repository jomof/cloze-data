writeup: |-
  To make an い-adjective negative, you change the final い to く and add ない. So, for example, 暑い (atsui - hot) becomes 暑くない (atsuku nai - not hot). It's **important** to remember that the resulting くない acts like another い-adjective. This means it can be conjugated further. For the polite negative non-past, you add です, making it くないです. For the past negative, it becomes くなかった (plain) or くなかったです (polite).

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  The ない used here is different from the ない used to negate verbs. With い-adjectives, ない itself behaves like an い-adjective.
  *  You cannot use だ directly after an い-adjective, whether it's positive or negative. While です can be used for a semi-polite form in spoken language, be mindful of the context.
examples:
  - japanese: 高くないよ。
    english: It's not expensive, you know.
    conjugation: negative (plain, non-past)
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The 「よ」 at the end adds a sense of casual emphasis, often used in friendly conversation. A
      male speaker might use this with a female listener to sound more approachable.
  - japanese: このケーキ、甘くないね。
    english: This cake isn't sweet, is it?
    conjugation: negative (plain, non-past)
    register: casual
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The 「ね」 at the end seeks confirmation or agreement, creating a light and conversational tone
      appropriate for a first date. A female speaker might use this to engage with the male listener.
  - japanese: 昨日の映画は面白くなかったです。
    english: Yesterday's movie wasn't interesting.
    conjugation: negative past (polite)
    register: polite
    setting: informative
    nuance: The 「です」 makes the sentence polite and suitable for general conversation.
  - japanese: もし暇じゃなければ、また今度誘うよ。
    english: If you're not free, I'll ask you again next time.
    conjugation: negative conditional (ba-form)
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「暇じゃない」 is the negative form of the い-adjective 「暇」 (free). The conditional 「なければ」 creates
      a casual, slightly suggestive tone, implying a future opportunity if the listener is currently busy.
      The 「誘うよ」 is a casual way of saying "I'll invite you" and is typically used by males.
  - japanese: この部屋は全然広くないですね。
    english: This room isn't spacious at all, is it?
    conjugation: negative (plain, non-past)
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「全然」 emphasizes the negative meaning, and 「ですね」 seeks agreement in a slightly more formal
      way than 「ね」.
post_example_writeup: Remember that when using the negative form of い-adjectives, the resulting くない acts
  just like any other い-adjective and can be conjugated further into past, conditional forms, and so on.
