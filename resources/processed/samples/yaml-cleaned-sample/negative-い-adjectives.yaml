writeup: |-
  To make an い-adjective negative, you change the final い to く and add ない. Think of it like this: you're taking the い off the end and sticking on a くない. For example, 暑い (atsui - hot) becomes 暑くない (atsukunai - not hot).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The ない here is actually an い-adjective itself! This means it can be conjugated just like any other い-adjective. So you can have polite forms like くないです, past forms like くなかった, and so on.
  *  Remember that い-adjectives, whether they're positive or negative, cannot be followed by だ. You can use です for a slightly more polite tone in spoken language, but だ is a no-go.

    speaker_gender: female

      focusing solely on their looks.
