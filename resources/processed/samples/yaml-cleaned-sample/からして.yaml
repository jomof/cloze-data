writeup: からして is a combination of the conjunction particle から "from", and the て-form of the verb する "to
  do". It's used when the speaker is forming an opinion or making a judgment based on a specific piece
  of information. Think of it as saying, "going from this particular point, we can conclude...". It often
  carries the nuance of "even this single aspect suggests the larger picture". からして appears directly after
  the noun that serves as the basis for the judgment. Because it relies on a limited piece of information,
  it implies that the conclusion isn't necessarily definitive, but rather a strong inference. You can
  often translate it as "judging from", "based on", or even "even... suggests".
