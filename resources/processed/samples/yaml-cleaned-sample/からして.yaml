  \u304b\u3089\u3057\u3066 combines the particle \u304b\u3089 (from) with the \u3066-form of \u3059\u308b (to do). It indicates that the speaker is making an assessment or forming an opinion (B) based on a particular piece of information or method (A). This often translates to "judging from (A)" or "based on (A)." The underlying sense is that "going from (A), (B)" is a reasonable conclusion. This highlights that (A) serves as the available evidence or the means by which a judgment can be reached. Therefore, the implication is, "using this information, we can say (B)" or "using this method, we can conclude (B)."

  Because \u304b\u3089\u3057\u3066 suggests a degree of objectivity, it implies the speaker might not possess complete information and is making an informed guess. The nuance is often that "from the limited information about (A), (B) appears to be the likely situation."

post_example_writeup: While \u304b\u3089\u3057\u3066 implies a reasoned judgment, it's important to remember
  that the conclusion is based on available information, which might be incomplete. Therefore, the speaker
  is presenting a likely scenario rather than a definitive fact. The scope of information (A) directly
  influences the strength of the conclusion (B). For instance, saying "judging from the price" suggests
  a potentially reliable indicator of quality, whereas "judging from the name" might be a more superficial
  basis for an opinion.
