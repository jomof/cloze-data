  **からして** combines the particle **から** ("from") with the て-form of the verb **する**. It indicates that the speaker is forming an opinion or making a judgment (B) based on a specific piece of information or observation (A). The nuance is that (A) serves as the primary or perhaps only basis for the conclusion.

  The literal sense is "starting from (A), (B)". This highlights that (A) is the available information or method used to make the assessment. Therefore, it conveys the meaning of "going from that information, (B) can be said," or "using that method, (B) can be said."

  Because **からして** relies on limited information, the resulting judgment often carries a sense of probability or likelihood. It suggests that "based on what we know about (A), (B) seems to be the case." This implies that the speaker might not have complete information and is making an informed guess based on the available evidence.

post_false_friends_writeup: While many phrases express the idea of making a judgment based on something,
  **からして** specifically emphasizes the initial piece of information or starting point for that judgment.
  Phrases like **から見ると** or **にしたら** focus more on perspective. **ことから** emphasizes a specific fact as
  the reason. **に応じて** suggests a relationship of dependence or adaptation. **にしては** introduces an element
  of surprise. **からすると** and **ところを見ると** are quite similar, but **からして** often highlights the immediately
  apparent information. Finally, **にもとづいて** implies a more formal or systematic basis for the judgment,
  unlike the more observational nature of **からして**.
