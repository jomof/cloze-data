writeup: だけましだ is a set phrase indicating that "at least (A)," or that "one should feel grateful for (A)."
  This expression is often used in cases where the overall situation is negative, but it is still better
  than the alternative. This structure combines the particle だけ, meaning "only," and the な-Adjective 増し,
  meaning "better" or "preferable." Originally, まし is the conjunctive form of the う-Verb 増す, meaning "to
  grow" or "increase" (like 増える). Therefore, the literal meaning is "even just (A) is a plus, compared
  to what could have occurred." だけましだ is primarily used after verbs, い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives followed
  by な. In most cases, まし is written in hiragana or even katakana as マシ. The katakana version often further
  emphasizes that one should be grateful for (A). **Important Note:** Although less common, you might
  also see だけまだましだ. The addition of まだ, meaning "still," further emphasizes the point.
