writeup: 「ばかりでなく」 means "not only... but also" or "as well as". It's used to indicate that something is
  true in addition to something else. Think of it as adding more information or emphasizing multiple aspects.
  It combines 「ばかり」, which means "just" or "only", with the negative form of the auxiliary verb 「だ」. You'll
  often see variations like 「ばかりでなくて」, 「ばかりじゃなく」, or 「ばかりじゃなくて」, which all have the same core meaning.
  Just remember that 「ばかりでなく」 is generally considered a bit more formal than 「だけでなく」.
