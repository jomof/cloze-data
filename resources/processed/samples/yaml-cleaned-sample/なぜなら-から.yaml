  When combined with the conjunction particle から, なぜなら (or なぜならば) forms a set pattern that can be translated as "why (A), that is because (B)". Essentially, it is a way to highlight that a 'because' is coming at the end of the sentence, drawing attention to it. なぜなら itself is a conjunction that is a combination of the adverb, なぜ "why", and the hypothetical form of だ, なら. Literally, なぜなら～から is similar to "why is (A) so, (B) is the cause". This sounds quite dramatic in English but is a perfectly natural way of emphasizing a statement or fact in Japanese.

  To use なぜなら～から, state the fact or important piece of information as (A). Then, at the beginning of a new sentence, なぜなら will be followed by the reason or cause, with から finishing the sentence.

  The primary function of なぜなら in Japanese (as opposed to simply using から or ので by itself) is to gain the attention of the listener and inform them that important information is coming.
