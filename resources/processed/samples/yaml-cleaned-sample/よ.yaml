writeup: '「よ」 is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese. Its primary function is to convey **new information**
  to the listener or to add a touch of **emphasis**. It''s generally used when the speaker believes the
  listener is unaware of the information being shared. You simply add 「よ」 to the end of a sentence. While
  typically used for new information, 「よ」 is also frequently paired with 「ね」 (as in 「～だよ ね」) to seek confirmation
  or agreement, similar to saying "right?!" or "you know?" Be mindful of adjective and noun conjugation
  before adding 「よ」: nouns and な-adjectives require 「だ」 before 「よ」 in the plain form (e.g., 「ケーキだよ」),
  while い-adjectives do not (e.g., 「楽しいよ」). Using 「です よ」 after adjectives or nouns is also perfectly acceptable
  and adds politeness.'
