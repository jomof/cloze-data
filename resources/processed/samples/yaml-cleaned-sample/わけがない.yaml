  The grammar point **わけがない** expresses a strong sense of impossibility or denial. It literally means "there is no reason/way," emphasizing that something is absolutely not going to happen or is absolutely not true. Think of it as a forceful way of saying "it's impossible" or "there's no way." **わけ** functions similarly to "reason" or "circumstance," and when combined with **がない** (there isn't), it creates this strong negative meaning. It's used after the dictionary form of verbs or i-adjectives, and after na-adjectives or nouns with な.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Strength:** Compared to other expressions like 「はずがない」, 「わけがない」 conveys a stronger sense of certainty and impossibility.
  *  **Emphasis:** It highlights the lack of any logical reason or possibility for something to occur.
  *  **Contrast with わけではない:** Be careful not to confuse it with 「わけではない」, which means "it's not that" or "it doesn't mean that." 「わけがない」 is about something being impossible, while 「わけではない」 is about clarifying a misunderstanding or limitation.

post_false_friends_writeup: 'To avoid mixing up 「わけがない」 with similar expressions, remember that 「わけがない」
  is the strongest way to say something is impossible or that there''s absolutely no reason for something
  to be true. Consider the nuances: 「ことはない」 is about necessity, 「はずがない」 is about expectations, 「わけではない」
  is about clarifying a point, 「ようがない」 is about methods, and 「そうもない」 is about likelihood. Focusing on
  the core meaning of absolute impossibility will help you use 「わけがない」 correctly.'
