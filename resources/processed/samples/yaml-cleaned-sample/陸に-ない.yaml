writeup: |-
  When the adverb 陸に (pronounced "roku ni") meaning "satisfactorily" appears in a negative (～ない) sentence, it indicates that the action or state described is **not satisfactory**, **not enough**, or **not being done properly**. This grammar pattern appears at the beginning of phrases, before the main part of the sentence, which will include a negative word, often a verb in its potential negative form (e.g., 話せない - cannot speak). While 「ろくに」 will often appear in hiragana, it can also be written as 「陸に」 in kanji. Alternatively, 「碌に」 may also sometimes be seen, but this particular kanji is *ateji* (a kanji used purely for its pronunciation, not its meaning). This grammar point often carries the nuance of something being done without sufficient effort or being half-baked.

  **Fun fact**: 陸 (roku) comes from the kanji meaning "land," and is used with the reading of 「ろく」 when the nuance is flatness, correctness, or seriousness.

false_friends:
  - term: めったに〜ない
    meaning: Hardly, Rarely, Seldom
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both 「ろくに～ない」 and 「めったに～ない」 indicate infrequency, 「ろくに～ない」 emphasizes the *quality*
      or *sufficiency* of the action, whereas 「めったに～ない」 emphasizes the *frequency*.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「ろくに～ない」 and 「めったに～ない」, remember that 「ろくに～ない」 focuses
  on whether something was done *well enough* or *sufficiently*, not just how often it happens. If you
  want to say something doesn't happen often, use 「めったに～ない」. If you want to say something wasn't done
  properly, use 「ろくに～ない」.
