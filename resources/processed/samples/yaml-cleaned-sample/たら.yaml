  The conjunction particle **たら** is used as a kind of "halfway point" between "if" and "when" in Japanese. It expresses the completion of an (A) action, and then a (B) action that is considered to be the result of (A). It may be hypothetical, or it may be presenting a one-time result of something that happened in the past.

  To use **たら**, attach it to the past form of verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. For verbs and い-adjectives, this involves changing the ます-form ending to the past tense (e.g., 食べます → 食べた → 食べたら, 寒いです → 寒かった → 寒かったら). For な-adjectives and nouns, add "だ" in the past tense (だった) before adding たら (e.g., 好きです → 好きだった → 好きだったら, 明日です → 明日だった → 明日だったら).

  **Caution:** Despite appearing to be the past form of the word it's attached to, **たら** itself doesn't actually carry the nuance of "past". Other words in the sentence will need to be examined to see whether **たら** is truly highlighting something from the past, or simply the completion of something (which may or may not happen in the future).

  **Fun Fact:** Although **たら** is regularly used to mean "if", it almost always has a nuance of "when". This is due to **たら** specifically highlighting the following situations:

  *  **Completion**: 完了 - Completion of (A).
  *  **Materialization**: 成立 - Coming to fruition of (A).

  These meanings are opposed to other "if" structures like **ば**, and **なら**, which focus far more strongly on the hypothetical "if" meaning.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion with similar expressions, remember that **たら** inherently
  implies a sequence where the completion of the first part is a prerequisite for the second. While other
  expressions like **ば** and **なら** focus more on the hypothetical, and **てから** emphasizes the order of
  events, **たら** bridges the gap between a conditional and a temporal clause. Pay attention to the context
  to determine if the speaker is highlighting a sequence of events or a conditional scenario.
