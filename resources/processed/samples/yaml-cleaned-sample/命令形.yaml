writeup: |-
  The imperative form (命令形, *meireikei*) is a way to express a direct command or instruction. It's the most direct and forceful way to tell someone to do something. Because of this, it can often sound rude or threatening, so it's **not commonly used in everyday conversation**.

  You'll see it more often on signs (like traffic signs), posters, or banners, especially in public spaces. It's also used in situations where there's an immediate need to give a command, like in emergencies or when cheering at sporting events.

  **How to form it:**

  *  **う-Verbs:** Change the last kana of the verb to the え-sound kana in the same row. For example, 「書く」 (*kaku*, to write) becomes 「書け」 (*kake*!, write!).
  *  **る-Verbs:** Replace the 「る」 with 「ろ」 or 「よ」. For example, 「食べる」 (*taberu*, to eat) becomes 「食べろ」 (*tabero*!, eat!) or 「食べよ」 (*tabeyo*!, eat!). Using 「よ」 is considered more formal and literary now. 「ろ」 is more common in modern speech.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Register:** This form is very informal and can sound aggressive, so use it with caution!
  *  **Softening the Tone:** Men may sometimes use the particle 「よ」 to soften the command and offer friendly advice or encouragement, but this is typically between close male friends. Women usually opt for the more polite て-form.
  *  **Exceptions:** The verbs 「ある」 and 「いる」 don't usually have an imperative form because they express existence rather than an action.
  *  **Polite Imperative:** The 「〜なさい」 form is a softer, more polite imperative often used by teachers or parents when speaking to children or giving instructions. You'll often see it on tests and assignments.
  *  **To Animals**: Polite prefix お plus the ます-stem will also occasionally be used to give polite commands to animals.
