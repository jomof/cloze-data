writeup: The grammar point なりに expresses that someone or something is doing the best they can within their
  given limitations or circumstances. It implies a sense of acknowledging one's own level or capacity
  and acting accordingly. It can be translated as "in one's own way," "for someone of their type/level,"
  or "as much as one can." It often carries a nuance that the effort might not be perfect or fully satisfactory,
  but it's the best that can be done under the circumstances. なり can be thought of as meaning "characteristic
  of" or "belonging to," so なり can be understood as acting in a way that is characteristic of oneself
  or one's situation. なりに can follow nouns or plain forms of verbs and adjectives.
