writeup: 予定だ is an expression that functions very similarly to つもりだ "to intend to do." The primary difference
  is that 予定 refers to a **plan**, rather than just an intention. Because of this, 予定 is used much more
  often for things that you have formal plans to do (like meeting a friend for lunch or attending a scheduled
  meeting). To use 予定だ, simply attach it to the dictionary form of a verb, or to a noun (after inserting
  の). **Important Consideration:** If だ or です is not added after 予定, it will imply that 予定 is simply modifying
  the verb or noun that comes before it, rather than being a standalone statement of a plan. This is similar
  to the difference between saying "I have plans to eat with a friend" (natural), versus "I have an eating
  with a friend plan" (unnatural).
