writeup: '「予定だ」 is an expression that functions very similarly to 「つもりだ」 "to intend to do". The primary
  difference is that 「予定」 refers to a **plan**, rather than a simple **intention**. Because of this, 「予定」
  is used far more frequently for things that you have formal plans to do (like meeting a friend for lunch).
  To use 「予定」, simply attach it to the dictionary form of a verb, or to a noun (after inserting 「の」).
  **Important Consideration**: If 「だ」 or 「です」 is not added after 「予定」, it will imply that 「予定」 is simply
  modifying the verb or noun that comes before it, rather than being a standalone "plan". This is similar
  to the difference between saying something like "I have plans to eat with a friend" (natural), versus
  "I have an eating with a friend plan" (unnatural).'

  Japanese.
false_friends:
  - term: つもりだ
    meaning: To plan to, to intend to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both 「予定だ」 and 「つもりだ」 express intention, 「予定だ」 emphasizes a **firm plan**, whereas 「つもりだ」
      focuses more on **personal intention** or resolve. 「つもりだ」 can be used for more spontaneous decisions
      or personal feelings, while 「予定だ」 is better for scheduled events.
  - term: つもりで
    meaning: With the intention of doing, instead of..., act as if or pretend, believing that..., thinking
      that...
    kind: related
    nuance: Unlike 「予定だ」 which focuses on future plans, 「つもりで」 has a wider range of meanings, including
      expressing intention for an action, acting as a substitute, or a state of belief. It does not directly
      translate to having a scheduled plan.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「予定だ」 is best used when discussing concrete,
  scheduled plans. 「つもりだ」 is more versatile and can be used for broader intentions, even those not yet
  firmly scheduled. 「つもりで」 has distinct usages related to intention, substitution, or belief, which are
  different from expressing a future plan.
