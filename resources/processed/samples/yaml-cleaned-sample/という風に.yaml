writeup: 'Similar to 「ふうに」, the grammar point 「という風に」 indicates that something is being done ''in the
  way of (A)''. It uses the suffix 風 (ふう), meaning ''wind'' or ''air'', to express that something is being
  done ''as if to say (A)'', ''as if to suggest (A)'', or ''in such a way that (A)''. As this construction
  is a combination of 「という」 ''to say'' and 「ふうに」 ''in a manner'', the literal meaning is akin to ''in
  a way that would say that (A)''. This emphasizes the speaker''s uncertainty about the actual situation,
  commenting primarily on appearances or impressions. 「という風に」 can follow verbs directly or nouns describing
  the manner of an action. The (B) part of the phrase clarifies what is being done ''in a way as if to
  say (A)''. **Important Consideration**: 「という」 often quotes the preceding statement entirely, so understanding
  what 「という風に」 emphasizes is crucial.'
