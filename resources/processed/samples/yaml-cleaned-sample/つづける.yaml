writeup: The grammar point 「つづける」 (続ける), meaning "to continue," is used to express the continuation of
  an action. It is attached to the **conjunctive form (連用形)** of another verb. This structure signifies
  that the action of the first verb is being maintained or prolonged. It's **important** to note the difference
  in nuance between using the conjunctive form + 「つづける」 and using the て-form + 「つづける」. While both express
  continuation, the conjunctive form emphasizes that the first action is being done *in a manner of* continuing
  something, whereas the て-form simply states that one action is followed by a continuation.

post_example_writeup: Notice how 「続ける」 attaches to the stem of the preceding verb. For example, 「走る」 (hashiru
  - to run) becomes 「走り」 (hashiri), 「書く」 (kaku - to write) becomes 「書き」 (kaki), and so on. The tense of
  the continuation is indicated by the conjugation of 「続ける」 itself.
false_friends:
  - term: ばかりだ
    meaning: (Only) continue to, Keep on -ing, More and more
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「つづける」, 「ばかりだ」 often carries a nuance of repetition or that nothing else is happening
      besides the continued action, sometimes with a negative connotation.
  - term: 一方だ
    meaning: More and more, Continue to, Keep on, -er and -er
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「つづける」, 「一方だ」 emphasizes a progressive change or a trend that is continuously advancing
      in one direction.
  - term: てくる
    meaning: To come to, To become, To continue, To be starting to, Has been ~ing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「てくる」 can indicate continuation, it often implies a change or a process over time, whereas
      「つづける」 focuses on the simple act of continuing.
  - term: ている②
    meaning: State of being, Has (have) done
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ている」 indicates a state resulting from an action or an ongoing action. While it can express
      continuation, it doesn't have the explicit focus on the act of 'continuing' like 「つづける」.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion with similar expressions, remember that 「つづける」 specifically
  means to maintain an action. 「ばかりだ」 often implies repetition, 「一方だ」 suggests a trend, 「てくる」 suggests
  a process or change over time, and 「ている」 indicates a state. Focus on the core meaning of actively 'continuing'
  when using 「つづける」.
