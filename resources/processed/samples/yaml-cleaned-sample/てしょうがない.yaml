  「てしょうがない」 is a common colloquial expression used when something "cannot be helped" or is "extremely" something. This structure is an abbreviated version of 仕様がない (shiyou ga nai), a phrase meaning "there's no way" or "it can't be helped." しょう is an easier-to-say version of しよう (shiyou). Literally, the meaning is close to "it's (A), and nothing can be done about it." Generally, this implies that the extent of (A) is so high that it cannot be overlooked or avoided.

  This structure follows the て-form of verbs, い-adjectives (drop the い and add くて), or the で-form of な-adjectives (drop the な and add で).

  Alternatively, 仕方がない (shikata ga nai) may be used, but there's a slight nuance. While both mean "it can't be helped," 仕方がない is generally perceived as slightly more formal and is more common in written language or more polite speech.

      laugh), focusing on the action of laughing.

    meaning: Very, Extremely, Can't help but feel
    kind: synonym

      instance, while 「てしょうがない」 describes a general state.
