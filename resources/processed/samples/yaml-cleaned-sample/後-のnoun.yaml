writeup: 'One common use of the noun 後 (ato), meaning "behind" or "after," is to indicate a remainder,
  or everything following a specific point. This can be translated as "what''s left of (A)," "the rest
  of (A)," "what''s remaining of (A)," or even "other than (A)." The 後 is typically followed by the case-marking
  particle の when modifying a noun. It can also come directly before numbers or be used at the beginning
  of a phrase. While its English translations can vary, the core meaning of 後 remains consistent: identifying
  a sequence and referring to what comes ''after'' or ''behind'' a particular point in that sequence.'
