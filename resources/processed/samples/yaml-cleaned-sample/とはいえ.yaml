writeup: The grammar point **とはいえ** (to wa ie) expresses a concession or acknowledgment of a certain fact
  or situation, followed by a statement that counters or limits the implications of that fact. It can
  be translated as "though," "although (I admit that)," "be that as it may," or "nonetheless." The structure
  literally means something along the lines of "even if you say that," indicating that the speaker acknowledges
  the preceding statement but wants to emphasize the point that follows. It is a relatively formal expression
  often used in written Japanese or more serious conversations. The part before **とはいえ** often presents
  a fact or a commonly held belief, while the part after introduces a reservation, a different perspective,
  or an exception.

    conjugation: とはいえ
    speaker_gender: male

    nuance: Using 「光栄」 (kouei - honor) is a formal way to express respect and admiration. 「～ちゃうな」 is a
      casual contraction of 「～てしまうな」, indicating a feeling that is happening despite one's intentions.
      The contrast between the formal 「光栄」 and casual 「～ちゃうな」 adds a touch of endearing nervousness, which
      can be flirty.

post_false_friends_writeup: While 「にせよ・にしろ」, 「であれ」, and their respective paired forms can sometimes be
  used in similar contexts to express concession, they often carry slightly different nuances. 「にせよ・にしろ」
  frequently deals with hypothetical situations or choices, while 「であれ」 emphasizes the universality or
  inevitability of a situation. To avoid confusion, focus on the core meaning of 「とはいえ」 as acknowledging
  a point before introducing a contrasting or limiting factor.
