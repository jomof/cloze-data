  使用域: 硬い
writeup: 'The grammar point **とはいえ** expresses a concession or acknowledgement of a fact, followed by
  a statement that contrasts or qualifies it. It often translates to "although," "though I admit," "be
  that as it may," or "nonetheless." Think of it as saying, "Yes, this is true, *however*...". It is considered
  a **formal** expression and is typically used in more serious or academic contexts. The structure is
  straightforward: a statement followed by **とはいえ**, then the contrasting or qualifying statement. The
  first part often presents something generally accepted or understood.'
examples:
  - japanese: この事件の犯人が分かったとはいえ、犯人はまだ捕まっていないからまだ油断はできない。
    english: Although the culprit in this case has been identified, we still can't let our guard down
      because they haven't been apprehended yet.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The use of 「とはいえ」 here, along with 「油断はできない」, creates a formal and cautious tone, appropriate
      for discussing a serious event like a crime. The phrase 「～とはいえ」 acknowledges the progress made but
      immediately emphasizes the remaining danger.
  - japanese: このパソコンは新しいとはいえ、今持っているパソコンより性能がいいと言うわけではない。
    english: Even though this computer is new, it doesn't necessarily mean it's better than the one I
      currently have.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「とはいえ」 is used to concede the fact that the computer is new, but then qualifies that with
      a contrasting point about its performance. The use of 「～と言うわけではない」 softens the statement, making
      it less assertive.
  - japanese: この国は安全だとはいえ、日本ではないので子供から目を離さないようにしてください。
    english: While it's true this country is safe, it's not Japan, so please don't take your eyes off
      your children.
    register: formal
    setting: cautious
    listener_gender: female
    listener_age: younger
    nuance: The speaker uses 「～てください」, a polite request form. 「とはいえ」 acknowledges the country's reputation
      for safety, but the following clause emphasizes the need for continued caution, especially concerning
      children. The formality is maintained throughout the sentence.
  - japanese: 日本人とはいえ、スペインで育ったから日本語があまり話せない。
    english: Even though I'm Japanese, I can't speak much Japanese because I grew up in Spain.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「とはいえ」 explains the unexpected situation where someone of Japanese nationality doesn't speak
      the language fluently. The statement is straightforward and informative.
  - japanese: 犯人は逮捕されたとは言え、有罪と宣告されるまで時間がかかるだろう。
    english: Although the suspect has been arrested, it will likely take some time before they are declared
      guilty.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The phrase 「とは言え」 acknowledges the arrest, but the speaker immediately introduces a contrasting
      point about the legal process, creating a formal and somewhat detached tone suitable for discussing
      legal matters. The use of 「～だろう」 suggests a reasoned prediction.
  - japanese: 馬は肉を食べることができる。とはいえ、普通は食べない。
    english: Horses are capable of eating meat. Nevertheless, they don't usually eat it.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Here, 「とはいえ」 connects two factual statements, highlighting a contrast between capability and
      common practice. The tone is objective and informative, fitting for a discussion about animal behavior.
  - japanese: 彼は社長とは言え名前ばかりだ。権限は取締役会にある。
    english: Although he's the president, it's just a title. The real power lies with the board of directors.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「とはいえ」 is used to downplay the significance of the president's title by contrasting it with
      the actual distribution of power within the company. The language is direct and suited for a professional
      context.
  - japanese: 論文:「この場合、「ようだ」と「ごとし」のどちらを使ってもよいということである。しかしながら、どちらも使えるとは言え、実際には意味合いが異なる。」
    english: 'Thesis: ''In this case, it means that one can use either ''ようだ'' or ''ごとし.'' However, while
      it''s true that both can be used, their meanings actually have different nuances.'''
    register: academic
    setting: academic
    nuance: The example is taken from an academic paper, indicated by 「論文」. 「とはいえ」 is used to introduce
      a nuance that qualifies the initial statement about the interchangeable use of grammar points. The
      use of 「～ということである」 and 「～が異なる」 are typical of academic writing.
  - japanese: 今では、パンデミックの進行状況は遅いとは言え、まだ安心するわけにはいかない。
    english: Even though the progress of the pandemic is slow now, we still can't afford to relax.
    register: formal

      the need for continued vigilance. The tone is cautious and serious.

  - term: にせよ・にしろ
    meaning: Even if, Even though, No matter, Whether… or
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「とはいえ」, 「にせよ」 and 「にしろ」 often introduce hypothetical situations or choices. They emphasize
      that a certain outcome remains the same regardless of the condition stated.
  - term: にしろ～にしろ
    meaning: Whether… or
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to the single form, 「にしろ～にしろ」 presents alternatives, indicating that the following
      statement holds true in either case, which is different from the concessive nature of 「とはいえ」.
  - term: であれ
    meaning: Even if, Even, No matter
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「であれ」 is closer to "even if" and often emphasizes that something holds true despite a specific
      condition. 「とはいえ」 focuses more on acknowledging a fact before introducing a contrasting point.
  - term: であれ〜であれ
    meaning: Whether or, Or, No matter which, In either case
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Like 「にしろ～にしろ」, 「であれ〜であれ」 presents alternatives, indicating that the outcome is the same regardless
      of the choice, which contrasts with the concessive function of 「とはいえ」.
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 「にせよ/にしろ」 and 「であれ」 share the nuance of acknowledging
  a condition or fact before making another statement, the key difference lies in their focus. 「とはいえ」
  specifically acknowledges a preceding statement as valid or true, and then introduces a contrasting
  or qualifying point. On the other hand, 「にせよ/にしろ」 and 「であれ」 often introduce hypothetical situations
  or emphasize that the subsequent statement holds true irrespective of the condition mentioned. Therefore,
  while they can sometimes be interchangeable, it's important to consider whether the primary function
  is to concede a point before contrasting it (**とはいえ**), or to state that a result remains the same under
  different conditions (**にせよ/にしろ, であれ**).
