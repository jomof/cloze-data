writeup: |-
  Partnered with the case marking particle に, the う-Verb 渡る "to cross" in its て-form highlights a span of something in regard to breadth, size, or time. This structure is often translated as either "across (A)", "throughout (A)", "extending through (A)", or "over the period of (A)". Like other verb structures that pair with nouns, the standard form may also be used when paired with a second noun, in order to modify that noun.

  Coming from the meaning of 渡る "to cross", this grammar pattern always expresses that something is either happening or exists "all across (A)", or "from the start to the finish". Additionally, にわたって is considered quite **formal**, so will often be seen in articles or on the news.

  **Important Consideration**: As 渡る indicates a span of something that is being crossed, the 'span' must always be indicated clearly.
