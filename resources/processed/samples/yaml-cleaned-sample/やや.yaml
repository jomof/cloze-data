writeup: やや is a Japanese adverb that means "a little bit", "marginally", or "slightly". It indicates
  that something is the case to a small extent, but it's still noticeable. Think of it as something being
  *somewhat* or *slightly* more than it was before. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence but
  can also be placed before the word it modifies.
