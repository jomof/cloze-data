  Similar to につき, につけ implies something is 'attached' to an event or occasion. Unlike に就き, this structure combines に with the conjunctive form of the る-Verb 付ける "to affix" or "to adhere". When using につけ, it often translates to "every (A)" or "whenever (A)". The second part of the sentence (B) usually expresses the speaker's thoughts or feelings in response to (A). Crucially, (B) is considered a natural consequence of (A). This structure can be used with verbs or nouns in their dictionary form. While you might see につけて, the abbreviated form につけ is much more common.
