writeup: |-
  Similar to に違いない, に相違ない is used to express strong certainty that something is true. It conveys the meaning of "without a doubt," "certainly," or "there's no mistaking it." You can use it to emphasize your own strong belief or to firmly agree with someone else's opinion.

  While 相違 can mean "difference" or "discrepancy" on its own, when combined with ない, に相違ない functions as a set **i-adjective**. Literally, it means "there is no discrepancy in (A)."

  に相違ない can follow verbs (in their plain form), い-adjectives (without い), な-adjectives (without な), and nouns (no particle needed before に相違ない).

  You'll often see に相違ない following から, highlighting that there is no doubt about the **cause** of something.

  **Important Consideration:** This grammar point is quite formal. In everyday conversation, に違いない is almost always preferred.
