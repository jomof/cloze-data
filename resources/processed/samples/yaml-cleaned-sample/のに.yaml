writeup: The particle 「のに」 functions as a conjunction to indicate purpose or necessity. It expresses that
  something is required or necessary to achieve a certain goal. Think of it as saying "in order to do
  X, Y is needed." 「のに」 is attached directly to the dictionary form of a verb. It's important to remember
  that 「のに」 also has another common meaning, expressing surprise or disappointment ('despite' or 'even
  though'), so context is **important** to distinguish the intended meaning. The 「の」 in 「のに」 nominalizes
  the preceding verb, turning it into a noun phrase, and 「に」 indicates the target or purpose.
