writeup: |-
  The verb やる (sometimes written as 遣る) primarily means “to do,” but it can also mean “to give” as the casual form of あげる. When attached to the て-form of another verb, it functions as a subsidiary verb. There are a couple of key ways to interpret ～てやる:

  *  **As a substitute for あげる (to give):** In this case, ～てやる often carries a nuance of the speaker doing something for someone they perceive as being in a lower position. It can sound patronizing, or imply that the speaker is doing something because the other person is incapable. This usage is often translated as “to do for.”
  *  **Expressing strong will or determination:** Here, ～てやる is similar to 見せる (“to show”) and indicates the speaker's strong resolve to perform an action. This is often translated as “I will do (A), just wait and see,” or “I'll definitely do (A).”

  Regardless of whether it's used in place of あげる or to express determination, the core meaning remains “to do,” with an added emphasis on the speaker's control and authority over the action and its outcome.
