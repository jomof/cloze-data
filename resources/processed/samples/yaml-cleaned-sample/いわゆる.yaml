grammar_point: いわゆる
jlpt: N2
meaning: What is called, So-called, Generally known
details:
  Register: Standard
  使用域: 一般
etymology: いわゆる is derived from 言(い)う (iu), meaning "to say", in its indeterminate form いわ (iwa), combined
  with ゆる (yuru), which is the classical literary equivalent of the auxiliary verb れる (reru), the passive
  or potential auxiliary verb, in its attributive form. Thus, the literal meaning is akin to "what is
  said to be."
writeup: いわゆる, sometimes written in kanji as 所謂, is used before a noun to indicate that something is "what
  is called (A)", "the so-called (A)", or "generally known as (A)". It essentially flags a term as being
  commonly used or understood in a particular way. You can think of it as drawing on a shared understanding
  or existing label for something. It's a useful way to introduce a term that might be familiar to the
  listener or reader, or to acknowledge a common way of referring to something.

  - term: というのは
    meaning: ~ Known as ~ is, ~ Called ~ is, ~ Means ~, Because
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike いわゆる, 「というのは」 is used to provide an explanation or definition of a preceding term or
      phrase. It often translates to "which means..." or "because..."
  - term: という (each)
    meaning: Called, Named, Known as, As much as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「という」 can mean "called" or "named", it's generally used to specify a name or title directly.
      いわゆる implies a more general or commonly accepted designation.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that いわゆる highlights a common or accepted name
  for something. 「というのは」 explains what something is, and 「という」 directly states a name or title.
