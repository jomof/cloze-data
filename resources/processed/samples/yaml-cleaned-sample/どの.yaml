  「どの」 is classified as a *rentaishi* (連体詞), often referred to as a pre-noun adjectival or determiner in English. These words don't conjugate, meaning 「どの」 always appears in the same form. It belongs to the same family of interrogative words as 「どれ」 (which one) and 「どこ」 (where). 「どの」 is used to ask about **which one** will be chosen from **three or more** options, or to inquire about **what kind** of thing is being referred to.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  「どの」 always **precedes a noun**. You can't say just 「どの?」; you need to specify 「どの本?」 (which book?).
  *  Be mindful of the number of options. Use 「どっち (の)」 or 「どちら (の)」 when there are only **two** choices.
  *  「どの」 can be used in questions, but it can also function similarly to "whatever" or "whichever" in English, indicating a selection from multiple possibilities.

      way to present his umbrella.

post_example_writeup: Remember that while 「どの」 asks "which one?" from a group of three or more, it also
  implies an element of choice or selection. It can also be used more broadly to ask "what kind of" when
  the options are numerous or unspecified.
false_friends:
  - term: あの
    meaning: That (over there)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「どの」, 「あの」 refers to a specific thing that is distant from both the speaker and the
      listener. It doesn't imply a choice.
  - term: どれ
    meaning: Which (of three or more)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「どの」, 「どれ」 stands alone or follows a noun. You would say 「どれが好きですか?」 (which do you
      like?) but 「どのケーキが好きですか?」 (which cake do you like?).
  - term: その
    meaning: That
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「どの」, 「その」 refers to a specific thing that is close to the listener. It doesn't involve
      a selection from multiple options.
  - term: この
    meaning: This
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「どの」, 「この」 refers to a specific thing that is close to the speaker. It doesn't imply
      a choice among multiple items.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「どの」 always precedes a noun and is used
  for asking about a selection from multiple options or the kind of something. The other words, 「この」、「その」、「あの」,
  point to specific items, while 「どれ」 stands alone or follows the noun when asking 'which one?'.
