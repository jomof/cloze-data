writeup: だけで is a combination of the adverbial particle だけ, and the case marking particle で. This expression
  is often understood as meaning "just by (A), (B)". However, a more literal understanding is closer to
  "with only (A), (B)". This reflects the で particle's standard usage of indicating a 'tool' or means
  used to achieve a certain result. To use だけで, simply attach it to the end of a verb's dictionary form
  (plain non-past) or a noun. **Important Consideration:** だけ highlights that there was potentially more
  than one option, but only one was chosen or used. In contrast, しか implies that there is only one possible
  option to begin with.

false_friends:
  - term: だけ
    meaning: Only, Just
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While だけ also means 'only' or 'just', it doesn't inherently carry the sense of the means or
      method like だけで does. だけ simply restricts the scope, whereas だけで specifies that something is achieved
      *by means of* something else.
  - term: だけあって
    meaning: Is only natural, …Being the case, Because, As might be expected
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike だけで, だけあって expresses a natural consequence or reason based on a preceding fact. It
      implies a stronger causal link and a sense of expectation, which だけで lacks.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing だけで with similar expressions, remember that だけで emphasizes
  the action or state that leads to a particular outcome. Think of it as highlighting the *method* or
  *means*. だけ simply limits the scope, and だけあって explains a natural consequence.
