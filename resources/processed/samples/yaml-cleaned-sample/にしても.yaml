writeup: |-
  Similar to にして, which highlights a point to consider or means "while", にしても emphasizes that the accompanying statement (B) is surprising or unexpected given the initial statement (A). Think of it as "even considering (A), (B)" or "even while (A), (B)". にしても can be used with any word in its plain form. It's also frequently used with WH-words like どこ, どの, だれ, なに, emphasizing that even with an undetermined aspect of (A) (like location, number, etc.), (B) still holds true.

  **Important Consideration:**
  Unlike としても, にしても can introduce completely new topics. This is because にしても suggests that (A) and (B) exist simultaneously, without (B) needing to directly result from (A). Conversely, としても always implies a causal link between (A) and (B).
