  The particle 「か」, typically used at the end of a sentence to indicate a question, can also be used within a sentence to embed a question. Think of it as transforming a direct question into a clause that acts like a noun. This embedded question often expresses uncertainty. The 「か」 in this usage is similar to the 「か」 in words like 「どこか」(somewhere). It highlights something indefinite or uncertain. This embedded question is usually followed by a verb or phrase that seeks information about this uncertainty, such as 「知っていますか」 (do you know?) or 「分かりますか」 (do you understand?). While you might also see the sentence-ending 「か」 at the end of the main clause, it's not strictly necessary because the internal 「か」 already signals the interrogative nature of the overall sentence.

  **Important Consideration:** Be careful not to use 「だ」 or 「です」 directly before this 「か」. This is why we say 「どこか」 and 「誰か」, not 「どこだか」 or 「誰だか」.

false_friends:
  - term: かどうか
    meaning: Whether or not, If...or not
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「かどうか」 also introduces uncertainty, it specifically emphasizes a binary choice - whether
      something is true or not. 「Question-phrase + か」 is more general and can embed questions with various
      question words like 何 (what), いつ (when), どこ (where), etc.
  - term: か (question)
    meaning: Or
    kind: synonym
    nuance: The particle 「か」 can also mean "or" when connecting options. For example, 「コーヒーか紅茶」 (coffee
      or tea). This is distinct from embedding questions; it presents alternatives.
  - term: か〜ないかのうちに
    meaning: Right after, As soon as, Just when, Barely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「か〜ないかのうちに」 is a grammar pattern indicating that something happens immediately after something
      else. It is not related to embedding questions but rather expresses temporal proximity.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that the 「Question-phrase + か」 structure functions
  to embed a question within a larger statement or question. 「かどうか」 focuses on 'whether or not', the standalone
  「か」 can mean 'or', and 「か〜ないかのうちに」 describes the timing of events. Pay attention to the context and
  the surrounding words to determine the correct meaning of 「か」.
