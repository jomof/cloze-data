etymology: The grammar point を限りに is derived from the particle を, indicating the object of an action;
  限り (kagiri), meaning 'limit' or 'end'; and に (ni), a particle indicating direction or time. Together,
  they create an expression that signifies setting a specific end or limit for an action or state.
writeup: |-
  を限りに is a structure that follows nouns to express a time when something that has been continuing will end. Common interpretations include “ending with (A), (B)” and “no longer than (A), (B)”. This grammar pattern uses the adverbial particle を, the noun 限り 'limit,' and the case-marking particle に. を限りに is primarily used for making proclamations or announcements and is more formal than similar structures like 限りで.

  **Important Considerations**

  Although を限りに almost always follows words indicating a specific time or place viewed temporally, the set expression 声を限りに, 'to the limit of one's voice,' breaks this usual rule.
