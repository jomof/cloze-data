writeup: を経て is a fairly formal grammar point used when highlighting a passage of time, or an event that
  took a certain amount of time. 経る itself is a る-verb that means "to elapse" or "to pass" in terms of
  time. The difference between it and 過ぎる "to pass time" is that 過ぎる focuses on having reached the end
  point, while 経る focuses on what was happening for the whole period leading up to that end point. Because
  of this, を経て can also be translated as "having undergone (A)", due to the emphasis being on the preceding
  action. を経て will directly follow nouns, and the rest of the sentence usually then goes on to describe
  the significance of that passage of time or experience, or what happened as a result. As it is a formal
  structure, を経て is often seen in biographies, introductions, and similar media.
