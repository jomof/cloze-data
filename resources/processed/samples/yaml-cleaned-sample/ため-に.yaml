  **ため** (or 為 in its kanji form) is a noun in Japanese that can be translated quite closely to "sake" in English. However, it is classified as a non-independent word in Japanese and must always be connected to another word which illustrates the "sake" that **ため** is highlighting. The case-marking particle **に** will often be added after **ため**, to show that (A) is a goal that something will be done to reach. Due to this, **ために** can be translated as "for the sake of (A)," or "in order to (A)." To use **ために**, attach it to the end of a verb in its dictionary form (plain non-past), or to a noun followed by **の**.

  Fun Fact: Despite mainly being used to highlight goals or things dictating an action, **ため** is also sometimes used to highlight events that have already taken place and their results. Due to this, a more accurate translation of **ため** (in all of its uses) is "in light of (A)." This simply highlights that (A) is the primary or major event/thing that resulted in (B) or will result in (B). When **ため** highlights past events, it is often translated simply as "due to" or "because of."
