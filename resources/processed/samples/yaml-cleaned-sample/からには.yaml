writeup: からには is an expression in Japanese that indicates something is either obvious or determined based
  on prior information. It translates to "as long as (A), (B)," "since (A), (B)," or "given that (A),
  (B)." It combines から, に, and は, literally meaning something like "from within (A), (B)." からには generally
  follows verbs and adjectives in their plain forms. It can also follow nouns or な-adjectives, often with
  である. The core nuance of からには is the speaker's strong sense that (A) is a foundational state (emphasized
  by には), and therefore, moving forward from that point (emphasized by から) makes the consequence in (B)
  unavoidable or the most logical course of action. The second part of the sentence expresses this determination,
  often reflecting a personal opinion or intended action. **Important Consideration:** While からは can appear
  independently, it's more formal and less common in everyday spoken Japanese.

post_false_friends_writeup: While these grammar points share a similar sense of 'since' or 'as long as,'
  pay attention to the specific nuances. 「限り」 often relates to limitations, 「さえ～ば」 to minimum conditions,
  「以上」 to declarations, and 「上は」 to formal commitments. 「ことにはならない」, conversely, denies a connection. Understanding
  these subtle differences will help you choose the most appropriate expression.
