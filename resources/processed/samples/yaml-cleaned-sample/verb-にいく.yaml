  **Verb + にいく** is used to express the purpose of going somewhere. It indicates that someone is going to a specific location with the intention of performing a certain action there.

  The verb that describes the action you intend to do (let's call this **X**) must be in its **ます-stem** form before adding にいく. This **に** particle indicates the goal or purpose of your movement.

  The general structure is: **[Location] へ/に X(stem) にいく**.

  For example, if you are going to a park to play, "play" (遊ぶ) becomes the ます-stem form (遊び), resulting in 遊びにいく.

  To express that you *went* somewhere for a purpose, use **X(stem) にきた** if you are currently at that location, or **X(stem) にいった** if you are no longer there.

  - japanese: ラーメンを食べにいく。
    english: I'm going to eat ramen.
  - japanese: サッカーをしにいく。
    english: I'm going to play soccer.
  - japanese: 図書館へ本を借りに行く。

  - japanese: 病院へ検査を受けに行きます。

post_example_writeup: Notice how the particle へ or に is often used before the location to specify where
  you are going. While both are acceptable in many cases, へ emphasizes the direction of movement, while
  に emphasizes the destination as a fixed point.

false_friends:
  - term: へいく
    meaning: To go to, To head toward
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Focuses on the direction or destination of travel without explicitly stating the purpose.
  - term: ていく
    meaning: To ~ and go, To go on, To start
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Indicates a continuous action or a movement away from the speaker, often with a sense of progression
      or ongoing change.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both へいく and ていく involve going somewhere, they don't necessarily imply
  a specific purpose for going. へいく simply states the destination, similar to "go to". ていく, on the other
  hand, often describes something that starts and continues over time, or a movement away from the speaker.
  To clearly express the reason for going somewhere, use **Verb + にいく**.
