writeup: 「**Verb + にいく**」 is a grammatical construction used to express going somewhere for a specific
  purpose. The verb preceding 「にいく」 is in its **stem form** (masu-stem), indicating the action that will
  be performed at the destination. Think of it as saying "to go in order to do [verb]". The particle 「に」
  here marks the purpose or goal of the movement. If you are already *at* the location and have come for
  a purpose, you would use 「Verb + に来た (きます)」.

false_friends:
  - term: へいく
    meaning: To go to, To head toward
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「Verb + にいく」, 「へいく」 simply indicates the destination without specifying the purpose
      of going there. For example, 「学校へ行く」 (to go to school) doesn't inherently imply what you will do
      at school.
  - term: ていく
    meaning: To ~ and go, To go on, To start
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ていく」 indicates a movement away from the speaker, often implying a continuation or a process
      starting. For example, 「歩いて行く」 means to go by walking, focusing on the method rather than the purpose.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「Verb + にいく」 always highlights the **purpose**
  of going somewhere. If you want to simply state the destination, use 「へいく」. If you want to describe
  the manner of going or a continuation, use 「ていく」.
