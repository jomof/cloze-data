writeup: The construction 「も又」 functions adverbially, indicating 'in addition to (A), (B)' or 'also with
  (A), (B)'. It follows nouns or noun-like phrases, emphasizing a significant point about the preceding
  element. Despite any contrasting opinions within the sentence, the noun or noun-phrase connected to
  「も又」 remains the primary focus. Written primarily in hiragana, 「も又」 can be considered a stronger version
  of 「も」.
