  **何か (nanika)** and **何も (nanimo)** are used to express "something," "anything," or "nothing." The crucial difference lies in their usage with positive or negative sentence structures.

  *  **何か (nanika)** is used in **positive** sentences and questions. It generally means "something" or "anything."
  *  **何も (nanimo)** is used in **negative** sentences. It means "nothing" or "not anything." It requires a negative verb ending (like ～ない or ～ません).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  In questions, **何か (nanika)** can imply that you expect or are offering something.
  *  **何も (nanimo)** paired with a negative verb creates a double negative, which affirms the "nothing" meaning.
  *  Casual forms like **なんか (nanka)** and **なんも (nanmo)** are common in spoken Japanese. **なんにか (nannika)** and **なんにも (nannimo)** are also used but less frequently than **なんか** and **なんも**.
