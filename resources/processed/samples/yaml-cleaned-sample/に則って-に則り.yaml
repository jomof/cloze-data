writeup: '`に則って` is a formal expression used when something is being done "according to (A)", or "in line
  with (A)". This is usually some basis, foundation, or standard which has a long-running history. The
  case-marking particle `に` is combined with the て-form of the う-Verb `則る` "to follow along with" in this
  grammar pattern. Based on this, the literal meaning is simply that (B) is something that follows along
  with (A). While several forms may be seen, the most common are a noun followed by `にのっとって`, or a noun
  followed by `にのっとった` which will then modify a second noun. Both the kanji form and the plain hiragana
  form are quite common, so it will be helpful to remember both. As (A) is generally considered to be
  something that has some kind of foundation, it will mostly represent a thing that has some kind of inception
  point from which point little, if anything, changed. Some examples are laws, traditions, standards,
  codes of conduct, etc.'
