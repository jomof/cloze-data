writeup: |-
  そうもない is an expression used with verbs in Japanese to indicate that a particular action is **very unlikely**. It combines the auxiliary verb そう (meaning "to appear") with the adverbial particle も (emphasizing the lack of possibility) and the negative い-adjective ない. Therefore, そうもない literally means "it doesn't even appear like (something will happen)".

  This structure is used after verbs in their **conjunctive form** (masu-stem).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Comparison with そうにない:** そうもない is **stronger** than そうにない. The addition of も emphasizes the unlikelihood, suggesting a higher degree of certainty that something will not occur.
  *  **Potential Verbs:** そうもない is frequently used with **potential verbs** to express that the possibility of something is practically non-existent. While it can be translated as "it doesn't appear as if (something) can be done", it often carries a stronger nuance, closer to "there's no chance of doing (something)".
