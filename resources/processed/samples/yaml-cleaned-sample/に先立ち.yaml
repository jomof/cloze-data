writeup: The grammar point **に先立ち (にさきだち)** combines the particle に with the noun form of the verb **先立つ
  (さきだつ)**, meaning "to precede" or "to take the lead." It connects to nouns and dictionary form verbs
  to indicate that something (B) happens before or in preparation for something else (A). You can think
  of it as "(B), before (A)" or "prior to (A), (B)." Because it comes from a verb, you might see **に先立つ**
  directly followed by a noun. The **に先立って** form is also very common, indicating the preliminary action
  more directly. Given its origin from the verb 先立つ, which implies a sense of importance or priority,
  this grammar point often emphasizes that the preceding action is a necessary step or occurs in anticipation
  of the following event. A common expression you'll encounter is **先立つ物 (さきだつもの)**, which literally means
  "things that precede" and refers to the necessary means (usually money) required to do something. This
  is often used in negative sentences.
etymology: The grammar point comes directly from the verb **先立つ (さきだつ)**, which combines the kanji **先
  (さき)** meaning "previous" or "ahead" and **立つ (たつ)** meaning "to stand." Thus, literally, it means "to
  stand before" or "to go ahead."
