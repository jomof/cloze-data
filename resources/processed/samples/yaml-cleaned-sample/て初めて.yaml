writeup: 「て初めて」 is used to express that a certain event or realization (B) happens **only after** a preceding
  action or experience (A). It emphasizes the dependency of B on A. The literal meaning of the components
  is 'having done (A), for the first time (B)'. It conveys a sense of discovery or new understanding that
  arises as a direct result of the initial action. It's **important** to note that the first verb does
  not necessarily have to be a truly 'first-time' event in the speaker's life, but rather the first instance
  where it led to the subsequent realization or event.

false_friends:
  - term: てからでないと
    meaning: (Not) unless ~ cannot, (Not) until ~ cannot
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「て初めて」, 「てからでないと」 usually implies a condition or necessity for the second action to
      be possible. It often carries a sense of 'unless the first action is done, the second cannot be
      done'.
  - term: てから
    meaning: Once...is done, After doing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「てから」 indicates a sequence of actions, it doesn't necessarily emphasize the 'for the
      first time' aspect or the realization that comes with 「て初めて」. It's a more neutral way of saying
      'after'.
  - term: 上で
    meaning: After, Upon
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「上で」 is often used for more formal or planned actions, emphasizing the preparation or basis
      provided by the first action for the second. It doesn't carry the same nuance of 'first realization'
      as 「て初めて」.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「てからでないと」、「てから」, and 「上で」 also indicate a temporal sequence, they don't
  precisely capture the nuance of a realization or understanding happening specifically **because of**
  and **for the first time after** the initial action, which is central to 「て初めて」. Be mindful of whether
  you want to emphasize the condition (てからでないと), the sequence (てから), the preparation (上で), or the realization
  (て初めて).
