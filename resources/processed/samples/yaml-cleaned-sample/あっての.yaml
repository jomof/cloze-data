  あっての is a pattern that emphasizes that (B) is something that only exists because of (A). It's often translated as "(B) owes everything to (A)" or "(B)'s existence is solely due to (A)." The structure is **Noun (A) + あっての + Noun (B)**. The noun preceding あっての is the reason or source (A), and the noun following it is the thing that exists due to that reason (B). あっての is typically used when (B) benefits positively from (A), and there's an implication of gratitude or acknowledgement towards (A).

  While the case-marking particle が can sometimes appear between noun (A) and あっての, it's frequently omitted.

  **Etymology**: あっての can be seen as evolving from the basic grammar structure がある ("to have"). The particle の marks (B) as the entity possessing or having a connection to (A), while the て-form of ある indicates a subsequent explanation or consequence. Because this additional information is important, (B) is almost always followed by structures like から or ので.
examples:
  - japanese: お客様あっての仕事だと思うのですが、理不尽なクレームを言われるとちょっとイラっときます。
    english: I believe my job exists only because of the customers, but I get a little annoyed when people
      make unreasonable complaints.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The speaker uses 「思うのですが」 which adds a touch of politeness to the statement while expressing
      a personal opinion. The use of 「イラっときます」 is a more casual way to express annoyance, creating a contrast
      with the initial polite phrasing.
  - japanese: 今回は皆様の努力あっての結果です。皆様本当にありがとうございました。
    english: This time, the results are due to everyone's efforts. Thank you all very much.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The phrase 「皆様の努力あっての結果です」 clearly attributes the success to the collective effort. The concluding
      「ありがとうございました」 expresses sincere gratitude in a formal setting.
  - japanese: 私はお金がなかったら愛もない、お金があっての幸せだと思います。
    english: I believe that love doesn't exist without money; happiness is only possible with money.
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker expresses a personal belief using the casual form 「～と思う」. The directness of the

      and happiness. 「～わ」 is often used by women in casual speech.
  - japanese: 「あなたあってのわたしです。あなたがいなければ私の人生は無意味ですよ。」

    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: intimate
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: This is a direct and romantic declaration. 「あなたあってのわたしです」 emphasizes the listener's importance
      in the speaker's life. 「～ですよ」 softens the statement slightly while still conveying strong emotion.
      The phrase 「あなたあってのわたし」 itself is a classic romantic expression.
  - japanese: 彼が大学をやめるのは、何か理由があってのことだろう。
    english: His dropping out of university must be because of some reason.

      that the reason is the sole cause for his decision.
  - japanese: 支配人、社員に:「ゲストあっての遊園地だということを忘れてはいけません。」
    english: 'The manager said to the employees: "You must not forget that the amusement park exists only
      because of the guests."'
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_age: older
    listener_age: younger
    nuance: The manager uses the formal imperative form 「～てはいけません」 to instruct the employees. 「ゲストあっての遊園地だということ」
      clearly establishes the guests as the fundamental reason for the amusement park's existence.
  - japanese: ベストセラー作者の演説:「 私の本は、家族の支えあってのものです。息子と夫がいなければここまでやってこれなかったと思います。」
    english: 'In her speech, the best-selling author said: "My books exist only because of the support
      from my family. I don''t think I could have come this far without my son and husband."'
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: formal
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: The author's speech uses formal language suitable for a public address. 「家族の支えあってのものです」 expresses
      deep gratitude. 「～と思います」 indicates a thoughtful reflection on her achievements.
  - japanese: 切手のコレクションが火事で全焼して悲しいのは分かっているけどさ、生きて逃げられたのは何よりだよ。「命あっての物種」だね。
    english: I understand that you are sad because your stamp collection was completely destroyed in the
      fire, but getting out alive is the most important thing. It's a case of "while there's life, there's
      hope,", you know?
    conjugation: dictionary form
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    nuance: The speaker expresses sympathy with 「悲しいのは分かっているけどさ」 but immediately shifts focus to the positive
      outcome using 「生きて逃げられたのは何よりだよ」. The proverb 「命あっての物種」 reinforces the idea that life is the foundation
      for everything else.
post_example_writeup: The examples demonstrate how あっての is used to express the idea that something's existence
  or success is entirely dependent on something else. It often carries a nuance of gratitude or recognition
  of the foundational element.
