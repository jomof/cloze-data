  あっての is a pattern which emphasizes that **(B) is something that only exists because of (A)**. It often translates to "(B) owes everything to (A)" or "(B)'s existence is solely due to (A)." The structure is **Noun (A) + あっての + Noun (B)**. Usually, the particle が between Noun (A) and あっての is omitted, though it can sometimes appear.

  This grammar point is primarily used when (B) benefits positively from (A), expressing or implying gratitude. The sentence often continues with から or ので to further explain the consequence of (A).

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  The focus is on dependence and often appreciation.
  *  Noun (A) is crucial for the existence of Noun (B).

      they make unreasonable complaints.
    register: semi-formal

      reflection.
