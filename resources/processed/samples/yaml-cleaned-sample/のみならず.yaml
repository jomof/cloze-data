writeup: のみならず is a formal expression that means "not only A but also B". It indicates that the statement
  is true for A, and even more so for B, often implying a degree of surprise or added emphasis on B. It
  is composed of のみ (only), なら (if it is), and ず (not), which literally translates to "if it is only (A),
  it doesn't end there". This structure connects to nouns, verbs in their dictionary form, い-adjectives,
  and な-adjectives. When connecting to a な-adjective, use 「な」 before のみならず. It can also be used at the
  beginning of a sentence as a conjunction, meaning "furthermore" or "moreover". **Important Considerations:**
  Due to its formal nature, you'll typically encounter のみならず in written materials, formal speeches, or
  business settings.

  formality and nuance can differ. のみならず is the most formal among them. Be mindful of the context and
  your intended level of politeness when choosing which expression to use. For casual conversation, だけでなく
  or ばかりでなく are generally safer choices. 限らず emphasizes the broader scope, and はもとより often implies a stronger
  sense of obviousness or 'let alone'.
