  the specific nuance each conveys. 「に伴って」 highlights consequence, 「と並んで」 emphasizes comparison, 「合う」
  suggests agreement, 「と」 simply lists, 「につれて」 indicates proportional change, and 「と同時に」 stresses precise
  timing. Understanding these subtle differences will help you choose the most appropriate expression.
