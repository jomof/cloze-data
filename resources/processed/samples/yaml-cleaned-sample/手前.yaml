  The nuance of **\u624b\u524d** changes slightly depending on the context. When used with a verb, it emphasizes the temporal proximity. Think of it as being right at the cusp of an action. For example, "\u6b7b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u307e\u3046\u4e00\u6b69\u624b\u524d\u3067\u52a9\u304b\u3063\u305f" highlights how close the speaker was to death.

  When used with a noun and \u306e, **\u624b\u524d** focuses on physical location or perspective. "\u5a18\u306e\u624b\u524d" simply means "in front of my daughter". The examples with "\u308f\u3051\u306b\u306f\u3044\u304b\u306a\u3044" demonstrate the "from one's standpoint" meaning, emphasizing the speaker's inability to act otherwise given the situation they are facing.

post_false_friends_writeup: While both **\u624b\u524d** and **\u307e\u3048\u306b** can mean "before" or
  "in front of", their usage differs in nuance. **\u624b\u524d** often implies a more immediate or personal
  sense of "before" or "in front of". It can relate to one's current situation or perspective. On the
  other hand, **\u307e\u3048\u306b** tends to be more formal and objective, often referring to a point
  in time before something else or a location that is simply ahead. To differentiate them, consider whether
  the focus is on the immediacy of the situation (**\u624b\u524d**) or a more general point in time or
  space (**\u307e\u3048\u306b**).
