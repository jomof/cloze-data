writeup: |-
  **\u624b\u524d** (te mae) functions as a noun meaning "in front of". It also carries nuances of time and perspective depending on the context.

  When used with a verb in its standard form, **\u624b\u524d** indicates a situation where (B) follows naturally or inevitably from (A). This often expresses a sense of moving forward from a completed or accidental event. It can be interpreted as "now that (A), (B)", emphasizing the lack of other options given the present circumstances.

  When **\u624b\u524d** is followed by the particle \u306e and a noun, it frequently indicates that what is "in front" of (A) is the reason for (B), or that (B) exists "in front of" (A).

  Despite these different uses, the core meaning of **\u624b\u524d** is something directly "facing" the noun or verb it modifies. Thinking of it as similar to "faced with (A), (B)" can be helpful to understand the sense of limited options or finality.

post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, **\u624b\u524d** can refer to a literal physical space,
  like "the thing that is in front of you." However, it also commonly expresses a situation just before
  something happens, like being helped "just before I would have died." The examples also illustrate the
  nuance of being in a situation where a certain action is almost obligatory, as in the examples using
  "there's no way I can..." This highlights the "from one's standpoint" aspect of the meaning.

  - term: \u307e\u3048\u306b
    meaning: Before, In front of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: More formal and typically refers to a point in time preceding an event.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both **\u624b\u524d** and **\u307e\u3048\u306b** can translate to "before"
  or "in front of," they are not always interchangeable. **\u307e\u3048\u306b** carries a more formal
  tone and often indicates a point in time prior to an event. For instance, you might say \u300c\u4f1a\u8b70\u306e\u524d\u306b\u8cc7\u6599\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3057\u307e\u3059\u300d
  (I will confirm the materials before the meeting). Here, **\u307e\u3048\u306b** clearly establishes
  a temporal sequence. While **\u624b\u524d** can also express this, it frequently emphasizes the immediate
  circumstances or the perspective of the subject, as in "faced with this situation." Choosing the appropriate
  term depends on whether you want to emphasize the time sequence or the immediate context and the speaker's
  position.
