  Coming from the word 少し (a little bit), すこしも～ない is an expression which translates almost exactly to "not even a little bit (A)" in English. Due to this, it indicates that there is "no (A)", "(A) never happens", or "not (A) at all", depending on whether a verb or an adjective is the word that is being negated.

  すこしも can come at the beginning of the sentence, or directly before the word/statement it is referring to.

  **Fun Fact**
  This construction is another example of how the も particle expresses that the word before it is surprising in some way, or unexpected. This was briefly discussed in the Number + も grammar point.

  Here we can see that も is highlighting 少し as being "surprising". This is where the "not even!" meaning comes from.

      doesn't have the same emphasis on "not even a little".
  - term: ぜんぜん
    meaning: (Not) at all
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ぜんぜん is very similar to すこしも～ない, but it can also be used in positive sentences when used alone
      (e.g., 「全然大丈夫！」 - Totally okay!). すこしも is always used with a negative.
  - term: 全く～ない
    meaning: Not~at all
    kind: synonym

    meaning: There is no need to, Never happens
    kind: synonym

    meaning: Not ~ at all, Cannot ~ at all

      common in everyday conversation.
post_false_friends_writeup: While several expressions share a similar meaning of negation, it's important
  to consider the nuances. すこしも～ない emphasizes the complete absence of something, "not even a little bit".
  Expressions like あまり～ない suggest a smaller quantity but not necessarily zero. ぜんぜん and 全く～ない are close
  synonyms, but ぜんぜん has some additional usages. Pay attention to the specific context to choose the most
  appropriate expression.
