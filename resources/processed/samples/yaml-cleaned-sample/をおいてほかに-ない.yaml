  を措いて is a grammar pattern that expresses something similar to "none other than (A)", or "nothing else but (A)". を措いて is a combination of the adverbial particle を, and the て-form of the う-Verb 措く 'to set aside'. In this way, the literal meaning is similar to English phrases like "setting aside (A), (B)", where (B) will be a broad statement about something that cannot be fulfilled by anything but (A). を措いて will follow nouns or noun phrases, and frequently have 他にない directly after it, emphasizing the point that "there is no other". を措いて tends to only be used when the speaker positively evaluates (A), and is giving it praise in saying that nothing else can compare to it.

  **Fun Fact**
  As this grammar point regularly appears in hiragana, it may be helpful to remember that this uses 措く 'to set aside', rather than 置く 'to place'. It may be easy to confuse these meanings, as they are very similar, and are classified as 同訓異字. These are words that have the same *kun-yomi* reading, and also have a similar meaning. There are hundreds of examples of these in the language, so memorizing words with the same readings will help in identifying the meaning of new kanji at a later stage.
