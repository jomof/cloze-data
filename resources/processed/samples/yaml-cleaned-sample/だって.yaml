  だって is a colloquial expression combining the auxiliary verb だ (a copula meaning 'is') and the adverbial particle とて. It functions in several ways, often expressing a reason, an excuse, or hearsay, and carries a casual tone.

  When placed at the **beginning of a sentence**, like でも, it signals a counterargument, excuse, or explanation for something previously stated or implied. This usage emphasizes the speaker's perspective, often to express displeasure or disagreement.

  At the **end of a sentence**, usually preceded by なん, なんだって functions similarly to "I heard that" or "it is said that," indicating hearsay or secondhand information. なんだって always follows a noun or a nominalized phrase (using の or こと).

  When used **directly after a noun**, without なん, だって emphasizes the preceding noun as a reason or premise, similar to the beginning-of-sentence usage and like でも.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  Because of its casual nature, using だって in formal situations is generally inappropriate.
  *  The childish/naive nuance often arises when used as an excuse, implying a lack of deeper reasoning.

  **Etymology:** The adverbial particle とて is a contraction of phrases like と言って (saying that) or と思って (thinking that). The fuller form, だとて, exists but is much less common than the more concise だって.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「だって」 often carries a nuance of justification
  or explanation, especially when used at the beginning of a sentence. Expressions like 「ということだ」 or 「ときいた」
  for hearsay are more neutral. When expressing contrast, 「それでも」 implies a stronger sense of overcoming
  an obstacle. For giving formal reasons, 「なぜなら〜から」 is more appropriate. When using "even if", 「たって」 emphasizes
  the condition, while 「だって」 in that sense emphasizes the reason behind the condition.
