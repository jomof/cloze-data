etymology: The suffix 「ら」 comes from the kanji 「等」 (とう), which means "etcetera" or "and so forth." This
  origin explains its function in indicating a group or plurality.
writeup: |-
  「ら」 is a suffix in Japanese that indicates plurality. It's attached to pronouns to refer to a group of people or things. It essentially means "and others" or "et cetera," implying there's more than one. You can attach 「ら」 to the end of pronouns like:

  *  **彼 (kare):** he → **彼ら (karera):** they (masculine leaning, or mixed group)
  *  **彼女 (kanojo):** she → **彼女ら (kanojora):** they (feminine leaning)
  *  **私 (watashi):** I → **私たち (watashitachi):** we
  *  **これ (kore):** this → **これら (korera):** these
  *  **それ (sore):** that → **それら (sorera):** those
  *  **君 (kimi):** you (casual) → **君ら (kimira):** you all (casual)
  *  **奴 (yatsu):** that guy/thing (derogatory) → **奴ら (yatsura):** those guys/things (derogatory)

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While 「ら」 functions as a pluralizer, it can sometimes carry a **casual** or even **slightly rude** nuance, particularly when used with pronouns referring to people other than yourself (like 「彼ら」 or 「君ら」). This is because the original meaning implies an "etc." which can sound dismissive.
  *  For people, 「達 (たち)」 is generally a more polite and neutral way to indicate plurality.
  *  Use 「ら」 cautiously when referring to people, especially in formal situations. It's safer to use 「達」 in most cases when referring to individuals.

      is used by a male speaker.

    register: intimate
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The 「～たいな」 expresses a soft desire, common in intimate and flirty contexts. 「私たち」 is a natural
      way for a female speaker to refer to herself and the listener.
post_example_writeup: Remember that while 「ら」 is a convenient way to indicate plurality, it's essential
  to be mindful of the social context and your relationship with the listener. In many situations, especially
  when referring to people, using 「達」 will be more appropriate.
