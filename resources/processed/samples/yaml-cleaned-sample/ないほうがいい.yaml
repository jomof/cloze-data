writeup: Similar to 「たほうがいい」, 「ないほうがいい」 is used in Japanese to give advice. However, this expression advises
  against doing something, suggesting it's better "not" to do it. This phrase is formed by combining the
  **negative plain form of a verb** with 「方 (ほう)」 (direction, way), the particle 「が」, and the *i*-adjective
  「いい」 (good). Think of 「方」 as suggesting a 'way' or 'direction,' making the expression imply that one
  specific choice—avoiding the action—is the better 'way' to go. This expression is quite direct and can
  subtly hint at potential negative consequences if the verb is performed.

  - japanese: これはお兄ちゃんが買ったピザだから、食べないほうがいいよ。
