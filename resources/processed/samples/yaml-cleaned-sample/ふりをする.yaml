  **ふりをする** is a Japanese expression that signifies pretending or acting as if something is the case. It combines the noun **ふり** (appearance, semblance) with the particle **を** and the verb **する** (to do). Essentially, it means "to make the appearance of" or "to give the impression of".

  Since **ふり** is a noun, it can be modified by the attributive form of other words to specify what someone is pretending to be or do. The core meaning of **ふり** in this context relates to showing a certain behavior or state outwardly, even if it doesn't reflect the internal reality. Therefore, while often translated as "to pretend," it carries a nuance of outwardly displaying something that may not be genuine.

post_example_writeup: The versatility of **ふりをする** allows it to describe a wide range of pretenses, from
  simple actions like pretending to sleep to more complex social situations like pretending to be happy
  or uninterested. It emphasizes the outward display or performance of a certain state, regardless of
  the true feelings or reality.

    nuance: Indicates resemblance or tendency rather than deliberate pretense.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both **ふりをする** and **っぽい** can describe something that is not entirely
  genuine, they function differently. **ふりをする** always implies a conscious act of pretending or making
  an outward show. On the other hand, **っぽい** describes something that has the characteristics of something
  else or tends towards a certain state, without necessarily implying intentional deception. For example,
  you might say 「彼は子供っぽい」(kare wa kodomo ppoi - he is childish/like a child), indicating a resemblance
  to a child, but you wouldn't use **ふりをする** in this context unless he was actively pretending to be a
  child.
