writeup: |-
  A fairly old-fashioned phrase, **上は** highlights that something is being done or considered as a result of (A). It may be interpreted as "once (A), (B)", "since (A), (B)", "now that (A), (B)", or "as long as (A), (B)". In these meanings, (B) will always be something that is deemed as either obvious or necessary.

  **上** in this phrase is a noun, and will be attached to the adverbial particle **は**. This creates a literal meaning that is similar to "over and above (A), (B)". This "over and above" has a similar nuance to "with that said", or "all things considered" in English, and just presents (A) as something that is finalized.

  This structure follows verbs in the standard form.

  Due to **上は** being quite old-fashioned, expressions like **からには** or **以上は** will be heard more frequently in modern-day Japanese, and will carry a similar meaning.

    kind: synonym

      old-fashioned 「上は」.

    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「からには」 is a more common and less formal alternative to 「上は」 in contemporary Japanese.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **上は** has a formal and somewhat old-fashioned
  feel. While **以上に** and **からには** share similar meanings of "since" or "now that", they are more frequently
  used in modern conversation. **上に** expresses addition, and **以来** refers to a point in time, so these
  have distinct usages from **上は**.
