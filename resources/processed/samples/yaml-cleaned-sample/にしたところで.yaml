  **\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067** and **\u3068\u3057\u305f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067** indicate that even if situation **X** is the case, result **Y** remains unchanged. This structure emphasizes a lack of control over the final outcome or that **X** doesn't make a significant difference. It conveys the meaning of "even in the case of X, Y" or "even for X, Y".

  This pattern combines either the case-marking particle **\u3068** or **\u306b** with the past tense of **\u3059\u308b** (**\u3057\u305f**), the noun **\u3068\u3053\u308d** (used to mark the situation), and the case-marking particle **\u3067**. It directly follows nouns or noun-modified phrases.

  You can think of this structure as combining **\u306b\u3059\u308b** ("going with X") or **\u3068\u3059\u308b** ("as X") with the **\u305f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067** grammar structure, which indicates negative outcomes ("even if X, not Y").

  In casual speech, **\u305f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067** is sometimes replaced with **\u305f\u3063\u3066**.

post_example_writeup: |-
  The nuance of **\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067** suggests that the speaker considers the situation **X** to be a notable or perhaps even an extreme case, making the lack of change in **Y** more significant. For instance, stating that even a highly skilled doctor can't cure every disease emphasizes the inherent difficulty of the task.

  Using **\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067** often implies a sense of resignation or acceptance of the inevitable outcome, regardless of the circumstances.

post_false_friends_writeup: While **\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067** highlights that even
  in a specific case the outcome remains the same, **\u3067\u3055\u3048** emphasizes the bare minimum.
  For example, "a child can do it" using **\u3067\u3055\u3048** suggests the task is very easy. **\u3067\u3059\u3089**
  indicates that if a certain condition is met, a specific result will follow, focusing on sufficiency
  rather than the unexpected lack of change. Finally, **\u306a\u3093\u304b** is used to give an example,
  often to soften a statement or make it less direct, and doesn't carry the same weight of inevitability
  as **\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067**.
