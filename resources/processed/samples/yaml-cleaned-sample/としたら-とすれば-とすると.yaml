  The grammar points **としたら**, **とすれば**, and **とすると** are used to express a hypothetical situation or assumption. They essentially mean "if it were the case that" or "assuming that." While there are subtle nuances, they are often used interchangeably in practice to present a condition and its likely consequence.

  *  **(A)としたら(B)**: Focuses on (A) as a hypothetical result, implying a condition leading to it, and then presents (B) as the subsequent action or consequence.
  *  **(A)とすれば(B)**: Similar to としたら, it highlights the hypothetical nature of (A) and introduces (B) as the outcome.
  *  **(A)とすると(B)**: Also indicates that (A) is a hypothetical situation and suggests (B) will follow from that assumption.

  To form these expressions, attach **と** followed by **したら**, **すれば**, or **すると** to:

  *  **Verbs:** Dictionary form
  *  **い-adjectives:** Dictionary form
  *  **な-adjectives/Nouns:** Followed by **だ**

  carries a slightly stronger sense of uncertainty or imagination, while **とすれば** and **とすると** might feel
  slightly more logical or based on a more concrete assumption. However, these are subtle nuances, and
  in many everyday situations, they are interchangeable.
