  **どうせ** is an adverb used in Japanese to express the idea that a particular state or condition (A) will inevitably lead to a certain outcome (B). It often implies that there's no way to prevent (B) from happening, regardless of the circumstances. In English, it translates to phrases like "anyhow," "at any rate," or "in any case."

  Being an adverb, **どうせ** typically appears at the beginning of a sentence. It often carries a nuance of frustration, resignation, or acceptance that the initial condition (A) cannot be changed. In these cases, it's frequently paired with grammar structures like **なら** or **だから**, suggesting that if (A) is unavoidable, then (B) is a logical or acceptable course of action. This usage can be similar to saying, "If (A), you might as well (B)."

  **Etymology:** The word **どうせ** is derived from a combination of **どう** (how) and the imperative form of **する**, which is **せよ**. Essentially, it emphasizes that no matter "how (A) is done," the outcome remains the same.

  - term: 何しろ
    meaning: No wonder, After all, In fact, Because, At any rate
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **どうせ**, **何しろ** is used more to emphasize a reason or explanation for something, often
      focusing on a difficulty or a reason for a certain outcome. It doesn't necessarily carry the same
      sense of resignation as **どうせ**.
  - term: 何といっても
    meaning: By any account, All the same, No doubt
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both can express certainty, **何といっても** emphasizes something being the best or most important
      reason, whereas **どうせ** focuses on the inevitability of an outcome regardless of the reason.
  - term: ～というのは事実だ
    meaning: It is a fact that ~, There is no doubt that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **どうせ**, 「～というのは事実だ」 is a more formal way to state something as a definite fact. **どうせ**
      carries a stronger nuance of acceptance or resignation about an inevitable situation.
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share some overlap in meaning with **どうせ**, it's important
  to note their subtle differences. **何しろ** often highlights a cause or reason, **何といっても** emphasizes
  a primary point, and 「～というのは事実だ」 formally declares a fact. **どうせ**, on the other hand, centers on the
  inevitability of a result, often tinged with resignation or acceptance of the circumstances.
