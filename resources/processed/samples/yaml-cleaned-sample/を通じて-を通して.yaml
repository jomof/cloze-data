  を通じて and を通して are two grammar patterns in Japanese that have very similar meanings, and are used in many overlapping situations. Primarily, they can be thought of as meaning "through (A), (B)", or "via (A), (B)". This "through" may indicate a method or a location.

  通じる ("to flow" or "to go through") and 通す ("to make a path") only differ in that the former is intransitive, while the latter is transitive. Because of this, 通じる will be seen more often regarding information or communication where (A) is the connection through which (B) occurs. 通す, on the other hand, more often refers to direct locations through which something is transferred or relocated.

  As this expression begins with を, it will appear after nouns, before expressing in the (B) part of the sentence exactly what was done "through" (A).

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  The primary difference between を通じて and を通して lies in the intransitive and transitive nature of the verbs themselves. Due to this, things that are being done "intentionally" or "by use of (A)" will tend to use を通して.
  *  を通 じて is more common when something is being done "throughout (A)".
etymology: The grammar point comes from the verbs 通じる (tsūjiru) and 通す (tōsu). 通じる means "to lead to,"
  "to connect," "to communicate," or "to understand." 通す means "to let pass," "to let into," "to permit,"
  or "to conduct."
