  風 (ふう) is a suffix that means "style," "way," or "fashion." Think of it like saying something is "-esque" in English. You attach 風 directly to a noun to indicate that something resembles or is in the style of that noun. For example, 「アメリカ風 (Amerika-fū)」 means "American style." You can also use の after 風 when it modifies another noun, like in 「メキシコ風の料理 (Mekishiko-fū no ryōri)」 which means "Mexican-style cuisine."

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The reading is always **ふう**, even though the kanji 単体 (tankan - alone) is usually read as 「かぜ」 meaning "wind."
  *  This suffix is versatile and can be used with countries, regions, time periods, or even concepts to describe a certain style or manner.
