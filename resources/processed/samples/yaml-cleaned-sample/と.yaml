writeup: One of the primary functions of と in Japanese is to mark a quotation. In Japanese, this is called
  引用 (in'you), which means "reference" or "citation." The particle と follows the quoted content, which
  can be a word, phrase, or sentence. Typically, the quotation is followed by a verb that indicates the
  act of quoting, such as 言う (iu - to say), 思う (omou - to think), 考える (kangaeru - to think), or 聞く (kiku
  - to hear/ask). However, the verb can sometimes be omitted, particularly at the end of a sentence where
  the context makes it clear. Essentially, と in this context highlights the relationship between what
  was said or thought and the act of saying or thinking it.

      a little flirty.

post_example_writeup: Remember that the particle と marks the content being quoted, and it's often followed
  by a verb of saying, thinking, or hearing. The brackets 「」 are typically used to visually separate the
  quoted material, especially direct quotes.
false_friends:
  - term: って (quotation)
    meaning: Casual quotation
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike と, って is a more casual quotation marker, often used in informal speech. For example,
      instead of saying 「晩ごはんを作った」と言った, you might hear 「晩ごはんを作った」って言った.
  - term: といってもいい
    meaning: You could say, You might say
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While と marks a direct quotation, といってもいい expresses a possibility or a way of describing something.
      It doesn't directly quote someone's words. For instance, 「彼は天才だ」といってもいい (You could say he's a genius).
post_false_friends_writeup: While both って and と can mark quotations, って is much more casual. Be mindful
  of your audience and the situation when choosing between them. On the other hand, avoid confusing と
  with the phrase といってもいい, which has a different function of suggesting a description or possibility rather
  than directly quoting.
