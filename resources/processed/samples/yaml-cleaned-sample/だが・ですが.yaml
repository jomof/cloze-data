writeup: |-
  While だが (or ですが as a polite equivalent) are classified as their own words, they are actually combinations of だ, or です, and が. だが is usually used as a formal way of saying "but", or "nevertheless". Think of it like saying "that may be so, but…" in English.

  **Key Points:**

  *  だが can be used at the beginning of a sentence or between two clauses.
  *  ですが is the polite version of だが. When using ですが, ensure the rest of the sentence maintains a polite register.
  *  Adding ね to だが (だがね) can soften the tone, but this is less common in modern Japanese and more associated with older speakers.
  *  In casual conversation, でも is a much more common and natural-sounding equivalent to だが/ですが.
