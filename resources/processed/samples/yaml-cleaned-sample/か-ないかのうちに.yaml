writeup: か～ないかのうちに is a slightly formal grammar structure used in Japanese to indicate a precise point
  in time where the action of (A) can not be determined as either being started, or finished. Usually,
  it highlights the exact moment either before or after (A) commences. This grammar structure is comprised
  of か, ない, か, の, the noun 内 "within", and に. Literally, it roughly translates to "while not knowing whether
  (A) or not (A), (B)". The verb that appears before か and ないか must be repeated in its dictionary form.
  Standard translations include "right after (A)", "as soon as (A)", and "barely when (A)". Additionally,
  か～ないかのうちに may be used to highlight relatively short periods of time within which something happens.
  This is usually in regard to some sort of positive or negative occurrence that would not usually be
  expected to be able to happen so quickly.

  - term: Question-phrase + か
    meaning: Including questions within sentences
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike か〜ないかのうちに which indicates the immediacy of an action, Question-phrase + か is used to
      embed questions into statements without implying a temporal relationship.
  - term: かと思ったら・かと思うと
    meaning: Then again, Just when I thought, No sooner than
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both express a quick succession of events, かと思ったら/かと思うと often implies a surprising or
      unexpected change of events, whereas か〜ないかのうちに focuses on the very immediate timing.
  - term: 直ちに
    meaning: At once, Immediately, As soon as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 直ちに is a more direct adverb meaning "immediately". か〜ないかのうちに is a grammatical structure that
      describes the almost simultaneous occurrence of two events.
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share a sense of immediacy, it's important to note
  their distinct usages. Avoid using Question-phrase + か when you want to emphasize the brief interval
  between two actions. Similarly, differentiate か〜ないかのうちに from かと思ったら/かと思うと by focusing on whether there's
  an element of surprise or just a matter of precise timing. Finally, remember that 直ちに is a simpler adverb,
  while か〜ないかのうちに is a more complex grammatical pattern.
