writeup: |-
  **第一 (dai-ichi)** is a Japanese expression used as both an adverb and a noun. As a **noun**, it signifies being the "foremost" or "most important" thing. You'll often see it followed by **の** when connecting nouns, or by the auxiliary verb **だ** at the end of a sentence. As an **adverb**, 第一 means "first" or "above all else". To use 第一 adverbially, you typically pair it with **に (ni)**, forming **第一に (dai-ichi ni)**. Sometimes, you'll encounter **まず (mazu)**, meaning "first of all," used alongside 第一に. While this might seem redundant, it emphasizes the very beginning or the absolute first point, similar to saying "the very first" in English.

  **Etymology:** The kanji **第 (dai)** is often translated as "number," but its literal meaning is closer to "position" within a sequence. Therefore, 第一 literally means "first position".
