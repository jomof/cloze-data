writeup: 「そばから」 combines the noun **側 (そば)**, meaning "side," and the case-marking particle **から**, meaning
  "from." It describes something (B) that happens immediately after something else (A). It can be translated
  as "as soon as (A), (B)" or "right after (A), (B)." Typically, (B) is something undesirable, annoying,
  or that negates the effect of (A), but there are exceptions. Thinking of a more literal translation,
  "from right beside (A), (B)," might help emphasize the immediate nature of (B).
