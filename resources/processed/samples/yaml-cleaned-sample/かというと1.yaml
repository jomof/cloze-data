writeup: |-
  ～かというと is a phrase that has two primary functions. The first is used in conjunction with 'why' and 'how' words, like どうして or なぜ, while the other is used with 'who', 'when', 'where', and 'what'. We will focus on the former in this lesson. かというと is a combination of the case marking particle か in its use as a question marker, the case marking particle と in its citation use, the う-verb 言う 'to say', and the case marking particle と in its result use. This is quite a few particles combined together, but the literal meaning is more simply 'if (A) were to be asked', before the speaker will go on to highlight their reasoning in (B).

  As ～かというと will come before some sort of explanation, から will also regularly be used at the end of the sentence as 'because', emphasizing the speaker's reasoning.

  **Important Considerations**

  Like other grammar points that utilize the "if" nuance of と, ば, and sometimes even たら may be used. However, たら will appear far less frequently than と or ば.

  follows an implicit or explicit question (often using どうして or なぜ) and explains the reasoning in response
  to that. ～かというと ② is used for a different purpose, often to introduce a specific choice or opinion.
