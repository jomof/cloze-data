  Used to convey the meanings of "there is nothing better than (A)", or "(A) would be the best", に越したことはない is a phrase that combines に, the past-tense form of 越す, an う-Verb meaning "to cross over", or "to surpass", こと, は, and ない. Literally, it means "there is nothing beyond (A)", or "nothing surpasses (A)". This structure will be seen with verbs, adjectives, and nouns in their standard forms.

  に越したことはない sentences generally present something positive, or some ideal outcome that is wished for.

  **Important Consideration:** It is also quite common to see に越したことはない following words that use ない. In these cases, rather than "(A) would be the best", the meaning simply changes to "it would be best if not (A)".
