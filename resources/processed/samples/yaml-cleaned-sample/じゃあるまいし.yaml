writeup: じゃあるまいし or ではあるまいし is used to express that something is not the case, so a particular action
  or expectation is unreasonable or unwarranted. Think of it as saying, "It's not like it's A, so why
  are you acting like B?" The core component **まい** is an auxiliary verb indicating negative volition
  or strong negation, similar to saying "I will not" or "it's unlikely to". Combined with **じゃ/ではある**,
  it emphasizes that something is definitely not the case. The final **し** particle adds the nuance of
  providing a reason or justification for the statement that follows. It's used after nouns or nominalized
  phrases (using の). The statement following じゃあるまいし typically expresses the speaker's negative opinion
  or criticism based on the fact that the preceding condition does not hold.
