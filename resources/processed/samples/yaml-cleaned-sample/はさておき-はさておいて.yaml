writeup: '**はさておき** is an expression often translated as "leaving aside (A)" or "apart from (A)." It combines
  the adverbial particle **は**, the conjunction **さて** meaning "now" (indicating a shift to a new topic),
  and the conjunctive form of the verb **置く** meaning "to place" or "to leave." The more literal interpretation,
  "now putting aside (A)," also applies. This structure is used when (A) is a topic the speaker wishes
  to move away from to discuss something more important. **はさておき** typically directly follows nouns. However,
  it commonly follows phrases ending with **かどうか**, translating to "disregarding whether it is (A) or
  not, (B)," implying (B) is a more relevant topic. **Caution**: **さて** can appear as 扨 or 扠, though this
  is rare. **置く** can be replaced by **措く** (also "to set aside"). **Fun Fact**: **冗談はさておき** is a fixed
  expression meaning "jokes aside" or "moving on to the serious business."'

  - term: はともかく
    meaning: Setting aside, Apart from
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both **はさておき** and **はともかく** can mean "setting aside," **はともかく** often carries a nuance
      of de-emphasizing something to focus on what follows, while **はさておき** more strongly signals a deliberate
      shift away from the previous topic towards something deemed more important or relevant.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing **はさておき** and **はともかく**, remember that **はさておき** is used
  when you want to actively move away from a topic, often because you consider the new topic more significant.
  **はともかく** can be used in similar situations but also when you simply want to shift focus without necessarily
  implying the first topic is unimportant.
