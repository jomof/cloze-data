  **何といっても (nanto itte mo)** is an expression that is used in almost exactly the same way in Japanese as it is in English, and qualifies that "no matter what is said, (A)", or "by any account, (A)". Breaking it down, we have the substitute noun **何 (nani)** meaning "what", or "whatever", followed by **と (to)**, the *te-form* of the *u-verb* **言う (iu)** meaning "to say", and finally **も (mo)**. The literal meaning could be understood as "even whatever one can say (A)".

  **Key Points:**
  - **Placement:** 何といっても is primarily used at the beginning of sentences.
  - **Positive Emphasis:** It frequently highlights something that is a positive aspect of the subject (A).
  - **Pronunciation:** The pronunciation change from **なに (nani)** to **なん (nan)** in 何 is simply for ease of speech.
  - **Occasional Negative Use:** Despite being mainly used in positive situations, 何といっても may occasionally appear with a negative nuance as well, although this is far less common.
