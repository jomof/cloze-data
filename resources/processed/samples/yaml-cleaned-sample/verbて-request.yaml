  In casual speech, the polite request form 「てください」 is often shortened to 「て」. This usually comes across as a friendly way to say "please do (A)", but may sound like a very soft order, so it's best used with friends or toward people of lower status. This nuance of 「て」 is usually identifiable when it appears at the end of a sentence as a request.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Sometimes, other forms of the て-form may appear at the end of a sentence. This happens most often when the speaker hasn't actually finished speaking but is thinking about what they want to say next. In these cases, the pronunciation of 「て」 will usually be extended (to highlight that the person is thinking).
  *  When emphasizing an apology, 「て」 may also be used. For this nuance to be conveyed, 「て」 will be attached to the 'reason' the person is apologizing and can be either positive or negative.

false_friends:
  - term: てください
    meaning: Please do (Polite request)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「Verb[て]」, 「てください」 is a polite way to make a request and is suitable for use with superiors
      or in more formal situations.
  - term: Verb + て
    meaning: And, Then (Linking events)
    kind: function
    nuance: Unlike 「Verb[て]」 used for requests, 「Verb + て」 connects clauses, indicating a sequence of
      actions or reasons.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「Verb[て]」 as a request with other uses of the て-form, pay
  attention to the context and the intonation. When used as a request, it often appears at the end of
  a sentence. When linking clauses, it connects different parts of a sentence without necessarily being
  at the end.
