  使用域: 一般
writeup: に決まっている is a strong expression indicating the speaker's firm belief about something. It conveys
  that (A) is something the speaker strongly believes to be true (though they might not have concrete
  proof) or that they consider (A) to be the only logical conclusion. This often translates to phrases
  like "surely (A)," "bound to be (A)," or "certainly (A)." Literally, breaking down the structure, に
  acts as a particle indicating a state, and 決まっている is the ている-form of the verb 決まる, meaning "to be decided."
  Thus, a very literal translation might be, "for (A) to be decisively the case." に決まっている can directly
  follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns. It's **important** to remember that に決まっている emphasizes
  the speaker's subjective opinion and their pre-existing thoughts about (A), regardless of the objective
  facts.

      or assertion.

false_friends:
  - term: にする
    meaning: To decide on, To choose, To make something into, To view something as
    kind: synonym

      a strong belief or assumption about something.
  - term: ことになる
    meaning: It will end up being, It is the result of, It has been decided that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both can relate to decisions, ことになる often refers to a formal or objective outcome or
      consequence, whereas に決まっている emphasizes the speaker's subjective conviction.
  - term: に違いない
    meaning: There is no doubt that, I'm sure
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Both に決まっている and に違いない express strong certainty, but に決まっている often carries a stronger sense
      of obviousness or natural conclusion based on the speaker's perspective, while に違いない simply asserts
      conviction.
post_false_friends_writeup: While にする, ことになる, and に違いない can sometimes appear similar in translation, it's
  important to distinguish their nuances. にする involves the act of deciding. ことになる refers to an outcome
  or decision being made. に決まっている is about the speaker's strong, often subjective, belief that something
  is the case. To avoid confusion, consider whether the focus is on the process of deciding, the result
  of a decision, or the speaker's conviction.
