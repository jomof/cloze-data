writeup: ましょう is a conjugation of the auxiliary verb ます, and it's a common and polite way to suggest doing
  something **together** with someone. It translates to "let's (do something)" or "shall we (do something)?"
  To use ましょう, simply change the ます ending of a verb to ましょう. While often translated as "shall we...?",
  ましょう isn't strictly a question for another person. It can also express a decision or intention to do
  something, similar to "I shall" in English, but more in a tone of suggestion or invitation.

post_example_writeup: Remember that while ましょう is polite, using the plain volitional form (verb+よう) can
  sound more direct or even masculine depending on context and intonation.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[よう]
    meaning: Let's, I shall (Casual volitional)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ましょう, Verb[よう] is a more casual way to express volition or make suggestions, often
      used among close friends and family.
  - term: ませんか
    meaning: Won't you, Would you not, Why don't we
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both invite action, ませんか is more of a question seeking agreement, whereas ましょう is a
      direct suggestion.
  - term: ～ましょうか
    meaning: Shall we, Shall I
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ～ましょうか is used when offering to do something or making a suggestion and explicitly asking
      for confirmation or agreement. ましょう is more of a statement of intent or a direct invitation.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that ましょう is a polite and direct way to suggest
  an action. Verb[よう] is its casual counterpart. ませんか is a more inquisitive way to suggest something,
  and ～ましょうか is specifically used when asking if an action should be taken, either by oneself or together.
