writeup: '**という** connects two nouns, indicating that the first noun is the name or description of the
  second noun. It translates to "called," "named," or "known as." It''s formed from the particle **と**
  and the verb **言う** (to say). Interestingly, while **言う** translates to "to say," its nuance in Japanese
  goes beyond simply vocalizing. **言う** often refers to information about something that cannot be discerned
  just by looking at it. For instance, you can see if someone is tall, but you can''t see their name is
  Bob. Therefore, **という** is generally used for information that requires specific knowledge or identification.
  When you see phrases like (A)**という**(B) where (A) seems obvious, the speaker might be hinting that their
  understanding or information about (A) is different or more specific than what''s immediately apparent.
  This nuance extends beyond nouns to other word types as well.'
etymology: The grammar point **という** is formed by combining the particle **と** (which marks a quotation
  or content) with the dictionary form of the verb **言う** (iu), meaning "to say." So literally, it means
  "that which is said [as]."

  accepted name. Pay attention to the context to choose the most appropriate expression.
