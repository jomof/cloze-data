  Similar to 「とうとう」, 「遂に」 is an adverb frequently used to express "finally" or "at last." It typically appears at the beginning of a sentence. 「遂に」 can be written with or without kanji. Compared to 「とうとう」, 「遂に」 carries a slightly more formal nuance.

  **Important Consideration:**
  The kanji 「遂」 carries a meaning akin to "to get (something) over with." Consequently, 「遂に」 is most appropriately used when describing events that have come to fruition after a considerable amount of time or a lengthy process. It's not suitable for situations that don't involve a significant duration or effort.
