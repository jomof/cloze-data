writeup: The grammar point **と並んで (to narande)** expresses the idea of something being comparable to or
  on par with something else. It literally translates to "lining up with" and indicates a similar level,
  status, or popularity. It's often used to compare two nouns or noun phrases, emphasizing their equality
  in a specific aspect. Think of it as saying "just like" or "as...as". While the base verb 並ぶ (narabu)
  means "to line up," the 「と」 particle here signifies a comparison, and the 「で」 form connects it to the
  rest of the sentence. It's considered a more **formal** expression.

  - term: に沿って
    meaning: Along, In accordance with, In line with
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「と並んで」, 「に沿って」 emphasizes following a path or guideline, both literally and figuratively.
      It doesn't directly compare the level or status of two things.
  - term: と共に
    meaning: Together with, At the same time, As well as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「と共に」 can sometimes overlap in meaning with 「と並んで」 by indicating simultaneous occurrence
      or inclusion, it doesn't inherently carry the sense of direct comparability in terms of level or
      status like 「と並んで」 does.

      qualities or status like 「と並んで」.
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share some overlapping meanings with 「と並んで」, it's
  important to remember their core functions. 「に沿って」 is about following, 「と共に」 is about being together
  or at the same time, and 「に伴って/に伴い」 is about consequence or accompaniment. Use 「と並んで」 specifically when
  you want to draw a comparison in terms of similarity in level, status, or popularity.
