writeup: '**逆に (gyaku ni)** literally translates to "reverse direction" or "opposite direction." As a
  grammar point, it expresses the idea of "on the contrary," "conversely," or "instead." It indicates
  that the second part of the sentence is the opposite of or different from what might be expected based
  on the first part. You can think of it as setting up a contrast or a surprising twist. It often appears
  between two clauses, linking them with this sense of opposition. However, it''s also commonly used at
  the beginning of a sentence to directly contradict a previous statement or suggestion. In casual speech,
  it can sometimes be used as a softer way of saying 別に (betsuni), indicating indifference or that there''s
  no strong preference.'
