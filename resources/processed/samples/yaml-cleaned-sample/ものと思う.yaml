details:

  使用域: 硬い
writeup: 「物と思う (mono to omou)」 is composed of the noun 「物 (mono)」 meaning "thing," the case-marking particle
  「と (to)」, and the verb 「思う (omou)」 meaning "to think." Common translations include "to believe that
  (A)" or "to have confidence that (A)." In a broader sense, this grammar pattern utilizes one of the
  meanings of 「物」 as something abstract that the speaker can reliably determine has all the qualities
  of something concrete. As 「もの」 is a noun, this pattern can follow any word in its attributive form.
  When 「思う」 appears in the past tense, the most common translation is "as I had believed was true of (A)"
  or "I was under the impression that (A)." Although this grammar construction is slightly formal, it
  may occasionally be heard in daily speech.
examples:
  - japanese: あの人はなんでもできると自信ありげに言っていたんで、仕事ができるものと思っていたが全然だった。
    english: He said confidently that he could do anything, so I expected him to be capable of doing the
      job, but he wasn't at all.
    conjugation: past (plain)
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「〜と思っていた」 indicates a past belief that turned out to be incorrect. The 「〜だった」 at
      the end adds a conclusive and slightly disappointed tone.
  - japanese: 夫の部屋からものすごいキーボードの音が聞こえたから、忙しいものと思っていたがただゲームをしていただけだ。
    english: I heard a tremendous keyboard sound coming from my husband's room, so I was confident he
      was busy, but he was just playing games.
    conjugation: past (plain)
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「〜から」 explains the reason for the speaker's belief. 「〜していただけだ」 minimizes the husband's activity,
      suggesting a slight annoyance or surprise. As a wife, using 「夫の部屋から」 is natural.

    english: Many people believe that marriage is a happy thing.
