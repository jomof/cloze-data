writeup: '**さ** is an 感動詞 (interjection) in Japanese with several uses. This explanation focuses on its
  role as a filler word, similar to "like," "you know," or "uhh" in English. It''s used when the speaker
  is thinking, hesitating, or trying to find the right words. This usage of **さ** can appear anywhere
  in a sentence and serves to create a pause or thinking time. The feeling it conveys isn''t necessarily
  negative confusion; it often simply indicates that the speaker hasn''t finished their thought. It''s
  common in casual conversation among people who are comfortable with each other.'
examples:
  - japanese: あのさ、私さあ、この前さあ、お金貸したじゃん?あれさあ、返してくれない?
    english: Hey, um… I, uhh, lent you, like, money before, right? You know… can you give that back to
      me?
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The repeated use of 「さ」 emphasizes the speaker's casual and perhaps slightly hesitant manner,
      common in informal speech among friends.
  - japanese: ね～聞いてよ。彼女がさ、急に別れたいっていって来たんだけどどうすればいいの。
    english: Heyyy, listen to this. You know my girlfriend? She suddenly came to me saying that she wants
      to break up with me, what should I do.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: The 「ね～」 at the beginning adds a sense of seeking attention and intimacy, and 「さ」 acts as
      a conversational filler while the speaker sets up the story with a friend.

    english: I am going to Hakone next week, soooo… Do you know any good restaurants?

      casually.
  - japanese: A:「私さぁ、明日から5連休なんだ！」B:「いいなぁー」

    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_age: older
    listener_age: younger

      less direct tone. While casual, in this context it acts as a polite way to transition into the question.

  - term: さ - Interjection
    meaning: All right, There we go, Now, You see, Well (I don't know, let me see)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike the filler **さ**, this interjection **さ** is often used at the beginning of a sentence
      to indicate a shift in topic, a decision, or a mild expression of uncertainty.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing the filler **さ** with the interjection **さ**, pay attention
  to the context. The filler **さ** can appear anywhere in the sentence and is often repeated, indicating
  hesitation or thinking time. The interjection **さ** usually appears at the beginning of a sentence and
  signals a transition or a moment of reflection before speaking.
