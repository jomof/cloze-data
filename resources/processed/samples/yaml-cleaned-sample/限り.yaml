writeup: |-
  The grammar point \u9650\u308a, stemming from the verb \u9650\u308b (to limit), is a versatile structure indicating a boundary or condition. Unlike some related patterns that include \u306b, \u9650\u308a directly follows the modifying word, allowing for a range of meanings.

  It connects to verbs in their dictionary, past, present progressive, or passive forms, and to nouns via \u3067\u3042\u308b (or \u3067\u3042\u308b can be omitted in less formal contexts where the noun clearly implies a state of being).

  There are several core interpretations:

  1. **Limitation:** This signifies that B is restricted within the scope of A. Think of it as "limited to A, B". For example, "\u4eca\u9031\u9650\u308a\u3067\u3059" (limited to this week).
  2. **Source of Information:** This highlights that B is true within the confines of information obtained through the senses or knowledge (A). This can be translated as "as far as A, B" or "from what A knows/sees/hears, B".
  3. **Condition/Assumption:** This implies that B will occur, given that condition A is met. Interpret this as "while A is the case, B" or "assuming A, B".

  In essence, \u9650\u308a always establishes A as the constraint or boundary within which B operates.

post_example_writeup: Notice how the nuance of \u9650\u308a shifts depending on the context provided by
  the preceding words. For instance, when paired with verbs of perception like \u805e\u304f (to hear)
  or \u77e5\u308b (to know), it conveys "as far as I know/hear". When used with a noun and \u3067\u3042\u308b,
  it often indicates a condition or state, translating to "as long as X is the case". The core idea of
  a boundary or limitation, however, remains consistent across these different usages.

post_false_friends_writeup: 'While several of these grammar points share the nuance of expressing a condition
  or limitation, their core functionalities differ. \u3068\u306f\u9650\u3089\u306a\u3044 explicitly expresses
  uncertainty, contrasting with the definitive nature of \u9650\u308a. \u304b\u3089\u306b\u306f places
  more emphasis on the reason or cause, whereas \u9650\u308a focuses on the boundary or scope. \u3055\u3048\u301c\u3070
  often highlights the necessity for achieving a specific result. \u306b\u9650\u308b, while also meaning
  "limited to", frequently carries a sense of "nothing is better than", a nuance absent in \u9650\u308a.
  To avoid confusion, focus on the core meaning you wish to convey: is it a strict limitation, a condition
  for something else, or an expression of uncertainty or preference?'
