  The grammar point **限り (かぎり)** is derived from the verb **限る (かぎる)** meaning "to limit." It expresses the idea of something being restricted or dependent on a certain condition or scope. There are a few key ways 限り is used:

  *  **Limitation:** This is the most straightforward usage, indicating that something is limited to a specific time, place, or quantity. Think of it as "limited to." It follows a noun directly.
  *  **Scope of Knowledge or Perception:** This usage signifies that a statement is true based on the speaker's knowledge, experience, or senses. It can be translated as "as far as I know/see/hear," or "to the best of my knowledge." It follows verbs in their plain forms or nouns with である.
  *  **Conditional Dependence:** This highlights that a certain outcome or situation is dependent on a specific condition being met. It conveys the meaning of "as long as" or "while (a condition is true)." It follows verbs in their plain forms or nouns with である.

  In all cases, 限り emphasizes the boundary or condition within which the following statement holds true.

post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse 限り with similar expressions. Consider the nuance
  you want to convey. If you want to emphasize obligation, 「からには」 might be more suitable. If you want
  to highlight that only one condition matters, 「さえ～ば」 might be a better fit. If you are expressing a
  strong preference, use 「に限る」.
