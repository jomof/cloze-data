writeup: The grammar point **どころではない** expresses that something is out of the question, far from being
  the case, or that it's not the appropriate time for something. It highlights a situation where the reality
  is much more significant or urgent than the stated possibility. You can think of it as saying, "It's
  not even at the level of X; the actual situation is much more..." The phrase usually appears at the
  end of a clause describing a situation that is being dismissed or deemed inappropriate due to the current
  circumstances. In casual speech, ではない can be shortened to じゃない.
examples:
  - japanese: 出産は痛いどころではないらしい。
    english: They say childbirth is far from just painful.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The 「らしい」 indicates the speaker is relaying information they heard, giving a slightly detached
      and objective tone.
    etymology: 「らしい」 means 'it seems like'.
  - japanese: 締め切りが迫って来てるから、休憩を取るどころじゃない。
    english: The deadline is approaching, so taking a break is out of the question.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The use of 「～てる」 instead of 「～ている」 adds a casual feel to the sentence. The context of an approaching
      deadline makes the situation serious.
  - japanese: お母さんからお父さんが倒れたと連絡があったので、仕事どころではない。
    english: It's not the time for working, since I got a message from my mother telling me that my father
      collapsed.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The sentence uses 「倒れた」 (collapsed), indicating a serious situation that makes work a secondary
      concern.
  - japanese: 今は仕事が忙しいし、お金も全然ないから、結婚どころじゃないよ。
    english: Right now I'm busy with work and have absolutely no money, so marriage is out of the question.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The 「～し」 is used to list reasons, and 「～よ」 at the end adds a touch of personal emphasis. This
      is a typical way a male speaker might express this sentiment casually.
  - japanese: 仕事が忙しすぎて、年休を取るどころではない。
    english: I'm so busy at work, taking time off is out of the question.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The 「～すぎて」 (too much) emphasizes the degree of busyness, making taking a vacation seem impossible.
  - japanese: 大病を患っているんだから、仕事どころじゃない。
    english: Since I have a serious illness, this is not the time for work.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The 「～んだから」 provides a strong reason or explanation for why working is impossible. It carries
      a tone of self-justification or explanation.
  - japanese: 今まで恋人も出来たことがないのに、結婚どころじゃない。
    english: Since I haven't even had a lover yet, getting married is out of the question.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: The 「～たことがない」 emphasizes the lack of experience, highlighting the improbability of marriage.
      The tone suggests a slightly sad or resigned feeling.
  - japanese: 「早く美容室に行け」と言われても、今はそれどころじゃないの。
    english: Even if you told me, 'Go to the beauty salon right away!', now is not the time for that.
    register: casual
    setting: annoyed
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The 「～の」 at the end adds a slightly emphatic and sometimes slightly defensive or explanatory
      tone, common in female speech. The phrase 「それどころじゃない」 directly dismisses the suggestion as inappropriate.
  - japanese: 休みの日はたくさん寝ていたい。君と遊びに行くどころじゃない。
    english: On my days off, I want to sleep a lot. Going out with you is out of the question... or is
      it?
    register: shitashii kuchō
    setting: flirty
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The intimate tone is set by 「～ていたい」 (want to do) expressing a personal desire and directly
      addressing the listener with 「君と」 (with you). The addition of "or is it?" implies a playful shift,
      hinting that despite the stated reason, the speaker might be open to changing their mind for the
      listener.
    etymology: 「君」 is a familiar way to address someone, often used in romantic contexts.
  - japanese: まだお互いのことをよく知らないし、ましてやキスどころじゃないかな。
    english: We still don't know each other very well, and moreover, kissing is definitely out of the
      question, right?
    register: first-date
    setting: cautious
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The sentence uses 「お互いのことをよく知らない」 (don't know each other well) to establish a reason for caution.
      「ましてや」 (much less, let alone) further emphasizes that kissing is an even more distant possibility.
      The 「～かな」 at the end softens the statement and seeks confirmation from the listener, showing consideration
      for their feelings.
post_example_writeup: Notice how the phrase before どころではない often sets up a seemingly reasonable situation,
  which is then dismissed as being too insignificant or inappropriate compared to the actual circumstances.
  The nuance lies in the contrast between the stated possibility and the implied reality.

  - term: ものか
    meaning: Definitely not, Absolutely not, Impossible, Do you really think~?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike どころではない, ものか expresses a stronger sense of negation or disbelief, often with an emotional
      component. It can also be used rhetorically as a question implying strong disagreement.
  - term: どころか
    meaning: Far from, Anything but
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike どころではない, どころか often introduces a stronger or more extreme example that contradicts
      the initial statement. It emphasizes the gap between what is stated and the actual situation, often
      in a way that highlights a positive-to-negative or negative-to-more-negative progression.
post_false_friends_writeup: While どころではない, ものか, and どころか share a sense of negation or contrast, their
  specific nuances differ. どころではない emphasizes that something is not the appropriate focus or concern given
  the current situation. ものか conveys a stronger sense of denial or disbelief. どころか highlights a contrast
  where the reality is the opposite or more extreme than the initial statement. Pay attention to the context
  to choose the most appropriate expression.
