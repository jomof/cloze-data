writeup: |-
  **だけに (dakeni)** combines **だけ (dake)**, meaning "just" or "only", with the particle **に (ni)**. It expresses the idea that something is natural, expected, or intensified **because of** a certain reason or situation. Think of it as emphasizing the direct causal link between the first part of the sentence and the latter part.

  You can often translate it as:

  *  "As might be expected of (A)"
  *  "It's only natural due to (A)"
  *  "Precisely because of (A)"
  *  "All the more because (A)"

  **Structure:**

  *  Noun + **だ** + けに
  *  い-adjective + けに
  *  な-adjective + **な** + けに
  *  Verb (plain form) + けに

  **Key Points:**

  *  **Emphasis on Causation:** だけに highlights the clear reason for the outcome or feeling described in the second part of the sentence.
  *  **Positive or Negative Outcomes:** It can be used for both positive and negative consequences or situations.
  *  **Implied Agreement:** The speaker often assumes the listener will agree that the outcome is logical given the reason.
  *  **Nuance of "Just In That":** The explanation "just in that it's (A)" effectively captures the core idea of drawing attention to the reason (A) to justify the consequence (B).

false_friends:
  - term: わけだ
    meaning: For that reason, No wonder, As you'd expect, Naturally, Thus, This is why
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both だけに and わけだ can express 'as you'd expect', わけだ often appears at the end of a sentence
      to indicate a conclusion or understanding reached, whereas だけに emphasizes the reason in the first
      part of the sentence.
  - term: だけあって
    meaning: Is only natural, …Being the case, Because, As might be expected
    kind: synonym
    nuance: だけあって is very similar to だけに and can often be used interchangeably. However, だけあって sometimes
      carries a slightly stronger nuance of praise or acknowledgment of someone's qualities or efforts.
  - term: だけのことはある
    meaning: No wonder, Not surprising that, As expected
    kind: synonym
    nuance: だけのことはある is used to express that something is worth the effort or expense, or that someone's
      reputation is justified. It often carries a nuance of validation or confirmation, which is slightly
      different from だけに's direct causal link.
post_false_friends_writeup: While だけに, わけだ, だけあって, and だけのことはある share the idea of something being expected,
  they have subtle differences in nuance and usage. だけに focuses on the direct causal relationship stated
  at the beginning of the sentence. わけだ often concludes a statement, indicating understanding. だけあって can
  imply a bit more praise, and だけのことはある confirms worth or reputation.
