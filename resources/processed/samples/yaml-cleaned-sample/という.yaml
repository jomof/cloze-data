  One of the uses of the extremely common という structure in Japanese is the pairing of identical nouns in order to convey the meaning of "every single (A)". In many cases, this expression will simply be used for emphasis, but the literal meaning is "every (B) that could be called an (A)". 「という」 will be used between the same noun repeating itself.

  **Important Consideration:**
  When this structure is seen with abstract expressions like 「今日」 "today", it will generally mean "(A) of all (A)'s". This implies that "of anything that can be called (A), this particular one has something special about it". What that special thing is will usually follow immediately after in the sentence.
