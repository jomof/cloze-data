  こそ is an adverbial particle in Japanese that primarily replaces either を or が. Its main role is to highlight the preceding noun (or noun phrase) as being **the most important** piece of information in relation to the rest of the sentence. In English, this effect is primarily achieved through things like bold text, underlining, or emphasizing a particular word in speech. Think of it like saying "precisely because it's (A)" or "rather it is due to (A)." こそ can be used directly after any noun that would usually take the を or が particles, as long as that specific piece of information needs to be emphasized.

  **Important Considerations:**

  The reason that こそ is able to replace が, but not は, is because が primarily highlights specific pieces of information, while は nominates general topics. These have opposite functions.

  To simplify, consider these particle distinctions:

  *  は - Weakly highlights specific information.
  *  が - Strongly highlights specific information.
  *  こそ - Very strongly highlights specific information.

  **Fun Fact:** こそ is often used after names or pronouns as a polite response to thanks or apologies. In these situations, it expresses that the speaker feels equally (or more) obliged to the other person.
examples:
  - japanese: この曲こそ俺がずーっと探していた曲だ！やっとタイトルが分かった。
    english: This song is definitely the song I have been searching for! I finally figured out the title.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    nuance: The use of 「こそ」 after 「この曲」 emphasizes that *this specific song* is the one he's been looking
      for. The 「ずーっと」 and 「やっと」 further convey his excitement and relief.

post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse 「こそ」 with expressions that share a similar nuance
  of emphasis or condition. 「こそ」 specifically highlights a noun as being particularly important or relevant
  within the sentence. Other similar expressions often have different grammatical structures and specific
  contextual uses.
