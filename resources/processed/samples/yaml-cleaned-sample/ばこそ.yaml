writeup: |-
  ～ばこそ is used to emphasize the reason for a particular outcome, similar to からこそ, but with a more **formal and somewhat old-fashioned** nuance. It conveys that (A) is the *precise* and sometimes **unexpected** reason for (B). The English translations include "precisely because of (A)" or "it is only due to (A) that (B)".

  **Structure:**

  *  **Verb/い-adjective:** \[verb or い-adjective in hypothetical form] + ばこそ
  *  **な-adjective/Noun:** \[な-adjective or noun] + であればこそ

  Often, the reason stated with ～ばこそ is something that one might not immediately think would lead to the stated result, thus the need for emphasis with こそ.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  ～ばこそ is considered **very formal** and somewhat **archaic**. In modern conversation, からこそ is generally the preferred and more natural choice.

false_friends:
  - term: ～てこそ
    meaning: Only if, Because, By, Unless, Until
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ～ばこそ, ～てこそ emphasizes the necessity of a condition being met for something to happen
      or be realized. While both can express 'because', ～てこそ focuses more on the conditionality.
  - term: からこそ
    meaning: Emphasized because, Precisely because
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar in meaning to ～ばこそ, からこそ is more commonly used in modern Japanese and has a
      less formal feel. ～ばこそ carries a stronger sense of formality and can sound somewhat old-fashioned.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that ～ばこそ is the most formal and somewhat archaic
  option among these expressions. While all three can translate to 'precisely because', ～てこそ highlights
  the conditional aspect, and からこそ is the most common and neutral choice in contemporary Japanese.
