writeup: '**あり** is the nominalized form of the verb **ある (aru)**, meaning "to be" or "to exist". In this
  grammatical context, it functions similarly to **なし (nashi)**, but instead of indicating the absence
  of something, it signifies the **presence or possibility** of something among other options. The nuance
  of **"among other things"** is key. **あり** suggests that the mentioned item is one viable option or
  a feature present within a larger context. It''s often used in response to suggestions to express agreement
  or the feasibility of an idea. While the kanji **有り** is more common, **在り** might occasionally appear,
  subtly emphasizing stand-alone existence rather than inclusion within a group.'
