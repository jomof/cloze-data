writeup: |-
  「かたがた」 is a conjunction often written in hiragana. It translates to meanings like “in addition to doing (A), (B)”, “along with (A), (B)”, or “incidentally to (A), (B)”. While both (A) and (B) have a similar level of importance, (B) carries a nuance of “while doing (A), also doing (B) in passing.”

  「かたがた」 is attached to a noun marking (A). When (A) is a noun that typically takes 「する」, the 「する」 is omitted.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  「かたがた」 is a **formal** structure primarily found in writing.
  *  It is often used in **apologies** or expressions of **gratitude**.
  *  Using 「かたがた」 when there's no specific reason for linking the actions can sound **unnatural**.

post_example_writeup: While the example “本棚の整理かたがた、春の大掃除をした” was marked as unnatural in the input, it
  helps illustrate that using 「かたがた」 requires a certain level of formality or a clear reason for linking
  the actions. In this case, casually cleaning a bookshelf while doing spring cleaning doesn't quite fit
  the nuance of the grammar point.
