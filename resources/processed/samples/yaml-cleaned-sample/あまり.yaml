  The noun あまり means "excess" and indicates a surplus of something. When used as a grammar point, it expresses that something occurred or exists to an excessive degree, often leading to a negative consequence. While 余り itself isn't inherently negative, this grammatical structure usually describes negative situations.

  You can attach あまり to the following:

  *  A verb
  *  An い-adjective transformed into a noun using さ or み, followed by の (e.g., 暑さのあまり)
  *  A な-adjective followed by な (e.g., 静かなあまり)
  *  A noun followed by の (e.g., 緊張のあまり)

  Following あまり, the (B) phrase clarifies the negative outcome. It's **important** to note that the tense of the entire sentence depends on the first clause. Therefore, the verb preceding あまり can appear in various tenses.

  - term: すぎる
    meaning: Too much, Very
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「あまり」, 「すぎる」 is directly attached to verbs or adjectives to indicate excessiveness
      without necessarily focusing on a negative outcome. For example, 「食べすぎる」 means "to eat too much."
  - term: あまり～ない
    meaning: Not very, Not much, Not really, Hardly
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「あまり」, which indicates excess leading to a consequence, 「あまり～ない」 expresses a low degree
      or frequency. For example, 「あまり食べない」 means "I don't eat much."
  - term: なかなか
    meaning: Very, Quite, Considerably
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「なかなか」 can indicate a high degree, it often carries a nuance of surprise or unexpectedness
      and doesn't inherently imply a negative consequence like 「あまり」. For example, 「なかなか美味しい」 means "surprisingly
      delicious."
  - term: あまりに
    meaning: So much...that, (Way) too...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「あまり」, 「あまりに」 expresses excess, but it often emphasizes the degree even more strongly.
      The structure is slightly different, usually followed directly by the adjective or adverb being
      modified. For example, 「あまりに暑くて」 means "it's so hot that..."
  - term: こそ
    meaning: For sure, For certain, Even more so, Underlined or bolded text
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「こそ」 is used for emphasis, highlighting a particular word or phrase. It doesn't express excess
      like 「あまり」. For example, 「明日こそ勉強する」 means "I will definitely study tomorrow."
  - term: からこそ
    meaning: Emphasized because, Precisely because
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「からこそ」 emphasizes the reason for something. It indicates a strong causal link but does not
      focus on the excessiveness of something like 「あまり」. For example, 「努力したからこそ成功した」 means "I succeeded
      precisely because I worked hard."
  - term: Adj限りだ
    meaning: Extremely, Really, Very, As ... as one can be
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「Adj限りだ」 expresses the utmost feeling of a particular adjective. While it indicates a high
      degree, it doesn't necessarily imply a negative consequence resulting from excess like 「あまり」. For
      example, 「嬉しい限りです」 means "I am extremely happy."
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「あまり」 specifically connects an excessive
  action or state to a (usually negative) consequence. While other expressions indicate a high degree
  or emphasis, they don't always share this cause-and-effect relationship.
