writeup: 'ということは is a phrase in Japanese that often appears in the middle of sentences, expressing that
  the previous statement is something that is about to be clarified or a logical conclusion drawn from
  it. This can be translated as "that means" or "that is to say". Sentences using ということは often conclude
  with ということだ, although this is not always the case. A more literal breakdown might be "that which is
  said to be (A), (B)", where (A) is presented as a topic needing further explanation or resulting in
  (B). Additionally, ということは can appear at the beginning of sentences to confirm understanding of something
  previously stated, often in the form of a question. In these cases, the translation is similar to "so
  you mean to say that (A)?" Breaking down the components: という (quotative ''to say''), こと (thing/fact),
  and は (topic marker), the phrase essentially highlights a ''thing'' (the preceding statement) as the
  topic leading to a certain understanding or conclusion.'
