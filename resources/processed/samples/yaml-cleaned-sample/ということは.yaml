  使用域: 一般
etymology: The phrase 「ということは」 is derived from the combination of 「と言う (to iu)」, meaning 'to say' or 'called',
  「こと (koto)」, meaning 'thing' or 'matter', and 「は (wa)」, the topic marker. Therefore, a literal breakdown
  might be 'as for the thing that is said'.
writeup: |-
  「ということは」 is a Japanese phrase that often appears mid-sentence to indicate that the preceding statement is about to be clarified or its implications drawn out. It can be translated as "that means" or "that is to say."

  Sentences using 「ということは」 frequently conclude with 「ということだ」, although this isn't a strict requirement. A more literal interpretation might be something akin to "that which is said to be (A), (B)," presenting (A) as something needing further explanation.

  Additionally, 「ということは」 can begin sentences when the speaker confirms their understanding of something just said, often in the form of a question. In these cases, the translation is similar to "so you mean to say that (A)?"

  As seen from the breakdown of 「という」, 「こと」, and 「は」, this statement expresses that the 'thing' classified as (A) is, in general, understood to be (B).
