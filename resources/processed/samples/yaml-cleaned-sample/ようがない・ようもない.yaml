writeup: '**様がない** or **様もない** is an expression used to highlight that there is no "method" or "manner"
  in which to do (A). It can be interpreted as "there is no way to (A)", or "it''s impossible to (A)".
  This phrase will appear attached to the **conjunctive form** of verbs. **様がない** often focuses on that
  the action of (A) is not possible, despite that the speaker may actually want to do it. **Important
  Consideration**: Because 様 will often appear in hiragana, it is important not to get it mixed up with
  よう, the auxiliary verb used to create the volitional form of verbs such as する.'
