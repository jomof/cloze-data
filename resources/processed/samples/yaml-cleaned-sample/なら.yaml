  As we discussed with ば, なら is often used alone to mean "if." It's considered an abbreviation of ならば, the hypothetical form of なり, a classical auxiliary verb not commonly used in modern Japanese. Because なり originally meant "to be," it functions similarly to the auxiliary verb だ. This means it naturally pairs with nouns or phrases that have become noun-like (nominalized) using の. However, unlike だ (or です), なら is regularly used directly with verbs or い-adjectives without needing の for nominalization.

  **Important Consideration:** Because なら is short for ならば, it's mainly used when guessing about what *might* or *could* happen in certain situations. Therefore, it's not typically used as "if" when discussing results achieved through effort or training.

  **Etymology:** なら comes from the classical auxiliary verb なり, but it's important not to confuse it with the particle なり, which can mean "as soon as" or "just after." Fortunately, the particle なり is also rare in contemporary Japanese.

    meaning: If (For emphasis)

    nuance: もし is an adverb that emphasizes the conditional nature of a statement. It can be used with
      なら, ば, or たら to add emphasis, but it's not a conditional particle itself.
  - term: もしも～なら・もしも～でも

    kind: synonym
    nuance: The particle と has numerous uses, including quoting and expressing conditionals. When used
      conditionally, it often describes a natural or inevitable consequence. なら often implies a more deliberate
      consideration of a condition.
post_false_friends_writeup: While several expressions translate to "if," they have subtle differences.
  なら often suggests a premise that has been acknowledged or confirmed before stating the consequence.
  ば is more general. たら can also mean "when." Expressions like としたら emphasize a hypothetical situation.
  Pay attention to these nuances to use the most appropriate conditional form.
