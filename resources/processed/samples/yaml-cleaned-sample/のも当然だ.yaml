writeup: Similar to て当然だ, the grammar point indicating that (A) is "natural" or "obvious", のも当然だ works
  in a similar way, and highlights that it is "no wonder that (A)", or "it is only natural that (A)".
  This construction follows verbs and い-Adjectives in their dictionary form, or な-Adjectives and nouns
  followed by な. As seen in some examples, も may replace は, adding a slight nuance of emphasis on the
  obviousness, according to the speaker. Compared to て当然だ, のも当然だ is perceived as slightly stronger, creating
  a more distinct separation between the preceding statement and the speaker's sense of what's "natural".
  Think of the subtle difference between "being happy is natural" (slightly weaker) and "it's natural
  that one would be happy" (slightly stronger) in English.
