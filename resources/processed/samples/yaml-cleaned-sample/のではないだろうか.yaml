writeup: 「のではないだろうか」 is a Japanese grammar pattern used to express an opinion indirectly, often framed
  as a rhetorical question. It conveys nuances such as "I think it's (A), isn't it?" or "It might be that
  (A).". The literal breakdown is の (nominalizer), ではない (isn't), だろう (probably), and か (question particle),
  essentially meaning "Isn't it probably that it's (A)?". This construction softens the assertion, making
  it sound more modest and less direct, similar to using tag questions in English. 「のではないだろうか」 can follow
  verbs and い-adjectives directly. For な-adjectives and nouns, 「な」 precedes the grammar point. 「でしょう」
  can also replace 「だろう」. This phrase is useful for seeking agreement or subtly persuading someone towards
  your perspective.

  - term: でしょう
    meaning: Right?, Probably, Isn't it?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「でしょう」 also expresses probability or seeks confirmation, it is generally more direct
      than 「のではないだろうか」 and doesn't necessarily carry the same nuance of a rhetorical question or indirect
      opinion.
  - term: だろう
    meaning: Right?, Probably, Isn't it?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「だろう」 is the plain form of 「でしょう」 and shares a similar meaning but is less polite and more
      assertive than 「のではないだろうか」.
  - term: じゃないか
    meaning: Isn't it?, Is it not?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「じゃないか」 is a more direct and sometimes accusatory way of saying "isn't it?" or "I told you
      so," lacking the indirectness and softer tone of 「のではないだろうか」.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「でしょう」、「だろう」、and 「じゃないか」 can sometimes express similar ideas of probability
  or confirmation, 「のではないだろうか」 is unique in its function as an indirect expression of opinion framed as
  a rhetorical question. Be mindful of the level of directness you intend to convey when choosing between
  these expressions. 「のではないだろうか」 is generally more tentative and polite.
