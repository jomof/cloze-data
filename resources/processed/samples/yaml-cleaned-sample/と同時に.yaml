  「と同時に」 is used to express that two or more things happen **simultaneously**. It combines the listing particle 「と」, the noun 「同時」 (same time), and the case-marking particle 「に」 (at). It can be translated as "at the same time as," "the instant that," or "as well as." The event described before 「と同時に」 is considered the primary event, but the subsequent events are not necessarily less important. For nouns and na-adjectives, 「である」 is often omitted.

  While it literally means "at the same time," 「と同時に」 is also used to describe multiple roles or functions someone or something has, conveying "as well as" while retaining the sense of simultaneity.
