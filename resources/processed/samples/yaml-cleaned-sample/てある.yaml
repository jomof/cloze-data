writeup: Similar to "verb + ている", "verb + てある" describes an ongoing state. However, "てある" is exclusively
  used with **transitive verbs** and emphasizes the object's state resulting from an action, rather than
  the actor. The particle が often marks the object when the action involves some preparation or effort,
  such as 予約 (reservation), 準備 (preparation), or 録音 (recording). In contrast, を is generally preferred
  for actions requiring less preparation, like opening a door. "てある" often translates to "to be left (done)"
  or "to remain (done)", highlighting the lasting impact of the action on the object, which is typically
  inanimate or unable to undo the action.

  of the object.

    meaning: As is, While remaining, Left in a state
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「てある」, 「ままに」 emphasizes that something is left in its original state, often due to
      negligence or lack of intention to change it. It doesn't necessarily imply a prior action was performed
      to put it in that state.
  - term: ておく
    meaning: To do something in advance
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both relate to actions, 「ておく」 focuses on performing an action with a future purpose
      in mind, whereas 「てある」 describes the resulting state after an action has already been completed.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「てある」 describes a *completed* action's result
  on an object, while 「ままに」 describes an *unchanged* state, and 「ておく」 describes an action done for the
  *future*.
