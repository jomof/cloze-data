  The word **まだ** is a versatile adverb that primarily conveys the idea of something continuing longer than expected or something not having happened up to the present moment. In English, it's often translated as "still" or "not yet," depending on the context. The core meaning of **まだ** is that a certain state or action is unexpectedly ongoing.

  When used with a **non-past affirmative verb**, **まだ** means "still." It indicates that something is continuing to happen, often implying a sense of surprise that it hasn't finished. For example, 「まだ雨が降っている」 (It's still raining) suggests the speaker expected the rain to stop.

  When used with a **negative verb**, **まだ** means "not yet." It indicates that something hasn't happened up to this point. For example, 「まだ食べていません」 (I haven't eaten yet) indicates that the action of eating hasn't occurred.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Emphasis:** You'll often hear **まだまだ** (mada mada), which emphasizes the meaning of "still not" or "not even close yet." This is used when there's a significant gap to overcome.
  *  **Questions:** **まだ** can also be used in questions to ask if something is still happening or hasn't happened yet, often with an expectation or curiosity.
  *  **Contrast with もう:** **まだ** is often contrasted with **もう** (mō), which means "already." They represent opposite ends of a timeline regarding the completion of an action or the continuation of a state.

false_friends:
  - term: もう
    meaning: Already, Anymore
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike **まだ**, **もう** indicates that something has already happened or is no longer happening.
  - term: まだ～ていません
    meaning: Still haven't done (something)
    kind: similar construction
    nuance: While **まだ** with a negative verb means "not yet," **まだ～ていません** specifically emphasizes the
      ongoing state of not having done something up to the present. It has a slightly stronger sense of
      something expected to be done.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **まだ** on its own is about the continuation
  of a state or the absence of an action up to now. **もう** signifies completion, while **まだ～ていません** highlights
  the unfinished nature of an action with an implied expectation.
