  Appearing most frequently at the beginning of sentences, **つい** is an adverb that may be translated as "accidentally", "unconsciously", "absentmindedly", or "against one's better judgment". **つい** will often be paired with statements that use **てしまう**, to emphasize that something was unintentional.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  Although "accidentally" is the most common meaning of **つい**, it actually may be used to convey three different nuances:
  *  **はからず** - Something that is uncalculated.
  *  **思わず** - Something that is not thought about.
  *  **距離がわずかなさま** - A small gap/interval.
  *  In each of these meanings, **つい** keeps a sense of time being the most important factor. Due to this, **つい** will give the impression that whatever resulted in the 'accidental' action, will be something that happened momentarily. This is very close to the meaning of 'lapse' in English: 'a lapse in time', 'a lapse in judgment', 'a lapse in forethought'.

    meaning: To do something by accident, To finish completely・totally, Unfortunately
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While **てしまう** often accompanies **つい**, it focuses on the completion or consequence of an
      action, sometimes with regret. **つい** specifically highlights the unintentional or impulsive nature
      of the start of the action.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **つい** focuses on the initial impulse or
  lack of conscious thought behind an action, often momentary. **いつの間にか** describes something unnoticed

  of completion and regret, and often works in conjunction with **つい** to emphasize the unintentionality.
