  を皮切りに is a grammar structure used with nouns to indicate the **starting point** of an event or series of actions, which then expands or continues. It often translates to "starting with (A)" or "beginning with (A)".

  This structure combines the adverbial particle を, the noun 皮切り (kawakiri), meaning 'beginning' or 'outset', and the case-marking particle に. It follows a noun or a nominalized phrase, setting the stage for what unfolded subsequently.

  Variations of this pattern include を皮切りにして and を皮切りとして, which carry the same core meaning.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  を皮切りに is typically used for events or actions with a clear instigator or cause.
  *  It's less common with natural phenomena or negative outcomes. The result following the starting point is usually positive or a planned progression.

  **Etymology:**

  The term 皮切り (kawakiri) literally translates to "cutting hide." Imagine the act of skinning an animal - this creates a clear starting point from which the process extends. This etymology can be a helpful mnemonic for understanding the nuance of something beginning and then expanding.

      are other similar items. While both can mean 'starting with,' を皮切りに emphasizes the **initiation**

  of a process or series of events that unfolds afterwards. はじめ, while it can also mean 'starting with,'
  often functions to introduce the first item in a list or a prominent example among others. The nuance
  of を皮切りに is more about a launching point for subsequent actions or developments.
