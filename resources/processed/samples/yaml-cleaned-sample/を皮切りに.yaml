  「を皮切りに」 is a grammar structure used with nouns to indicate the **starting point** of something, from which it then expanded or something continued to happen afterwards. It is often translated as "starting with (A)" or "beginning with (A)". This structure combines the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「皮切り」 meaning "beginning" or "outset", and the case-marking particle 「に」. It appears after nouns or nominalized phrases to introduce the initial event or action that led to subsequent developments.

  Variations of this grammar pattern include 「を皮切りにして」 and 「を皮切りとして」, which carry the same meaning.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  「を皮切りに」 is generally used with positive outcomes or events initiated by a specific agent.
  *  It's less common to use this structure for natural phenomena or negative results.

  **Fun Fact:** Although 「皮切り」 primarily means "beginning", the kanji combination (皮 - hide, 切り - cut) can be a helpful mnemonic, suggesting the idea of creating a starting point by "cutting" or initiating something that then expands outward.

  - term: をはじめ
    meaning: Not only...but also..., Starting with
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「を皮切りに」 which emphasizes a starting point that leads to subsequent actions or expansions,
      「をはじめ」 focuses on listing examples, often including a representative item. While both can translate
      to 'starting with', 「をはじめ」 implies 'including' more strongly.
post_false_friends_writeup: Both 「を皮切りに」 and 「をはじめ」 can mean "starting with," but they have slightly different
  nuances. Use 「を皮切りに」 when you want to emphasize the initial action that triggered a series of subsequent
  events or an expansion. Use 「をはじめ」 when you want to list examples, highlighting the first item as a
  representative of a group.
