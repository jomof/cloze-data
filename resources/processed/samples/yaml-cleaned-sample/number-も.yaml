  the actual amount is surprisingly high or low. Think of it as highlighting that even *this much* or
  *this little* is significant. It can convey a sense of "as much as" when the number is larger than expected,
  or "not even" when the number is surprisingly small or zero. While も can also mean "too" or "also,"
  in this construction, it specifically focuses on the unexpected nature of the quantity.
