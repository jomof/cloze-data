  「だけでなく」 (an abbreviation of 「だけではなく」) is a common construction in Japanese which translates to "not only (A), but also (B)". Sometimes the (B) statement may be left unsaid. This expression may connect to any (A) phrase that 「だけ」 would usually be able to connect to.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The 「で」 in 「では」 is not the particle 「で」, but the auxiliary verb 「だ」 in its conjunctive form.
  *  「は」 is regularly dropped from 「では」 expressions, or it may also be changed to 「じゃ」, for ease of pronunciation.
  *  The conjunction particle 「て」 should follow 「なく」, as it is the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective 「ない」. However, the 「て」 in this particular construction is very often omitted.
  *  In writing, if there is no comma (known as a 読点 in Japanese) after 「なく」, the full 「なくて」 construction will be required. When a comma is present, both forms are grammatically correct.

post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share the idea of 'not only... but also,' they have
  subtle differences. 「だけ」 is simpler and means 'only'. 「のみならず」 is more formal. 「だけでなく(て)～も」 and 「ばかりでなく」
  are very close synonyms. 「をはじめ」 is used for listing examples. 「に限らず」 indicates something is not limited,
  and 「はもちろん」 suggests the first point is a given. Pay attention to the formality and the specific nuance
  you want to convey when choosing between these similar expressions.
