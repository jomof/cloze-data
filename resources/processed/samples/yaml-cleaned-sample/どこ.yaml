  **どこ** is a pronoun that asks about a location. It directly translates to "where". It's part of the "どれ" family of interrogative words, but specifically refers to places.

  Important Considerations:

  *  **Contrast with どっち:** While both can sometimes be translated as "where", **どこ** focuses solely on the place itself. **どっち** is used when asking about direction or which of two options to choose. Think of **どっち** as implying a movement or a choice between two locations.

  *  **Politeness:** You can add ですか to the end (どこですか) to make it a polite question.

post_false_friends_writeup: Remember that **ここ**, **そこ**, and **あそこ** are definite locations. **ここ** is
  "here", **そこ** is "there" (near the listener), and **あそこ** is "over there" (away from both). **どこ**
  is used when the location is unknown and you are asking for information about it.
