writeup: ともあろう is a Japanese grammatical structure used to express surprise, disappointment, or criticism
  regarding the actions of someone or an entity, considering their status, skill, or responsibility. It
  conveys the idea of "of all people" or "someone like that." This pattern often implies that the person
  or organization should know better or behave more appropriately given their position. The structure
  combines the particle と, the adverbial particle も, and the volitional form of the verb ある (あろう). It
  literally suggests "even for someone who is supposed to be…". ともあろう typically follows a noun and can
  be emphasized by adding もの or 方 (かた) after the noun. The conjunction が is often used to introduce the
  surprising or contradictory action.
