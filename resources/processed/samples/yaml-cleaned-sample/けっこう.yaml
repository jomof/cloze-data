writeup: '**結構 (kekkou)** is a versatile word in Japanese, primarily functioning as an adverb meaning
  "quite," "a lot," "fairly," or "rather." It''s useful for indicating a significant degree or extent
  of something. Interestingly, **結構です (kekkou desu)** also serves as a common set phrase to politely decline
  an offer, similar to saying "no, thank you" or "I''m fine, thanks" in English. Think of it as a way
  to say you are satisfied with the current state and don''t need anything more. While it''s listed as
  a 副詞 (fukushi - adverb), it originates from a な-adjective, though you''ll most often encounter it modifying
  verbs, adjectives, or entire sentences directly.'
examples:
  - japanese: 袋は結構です。
    english: I don't need a bag, thank you.
    register: polite
    setting: shopping
    nuance: 「結構です」 is used here as a polite way to decline the offer of a bag.
  - japanese: いいえ、結構です。
    english: No thank you.
    register: polite
    setting: general
    nuance: A standard polite refusal using 「結構です」.

    english: This cake is quite delicious, isn't it?
    register: casual
    setting: eating
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「ね」 is a casual sentence ending often used by females to seek agreement or confirmation. Saying
      「結構おいしい」 indicates a pleasant surprise.
    etymology: 「おいしい」 is written with the kanji 美味しい, meaning 'delicious flavor'.
  - japanese: 昨日の映画、結構面白かったよ。
    english: Yesterday's movie was quite interesting, you know.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The 「よ」 particle at the end of the sentence is often used by males to assert information or
      express conviction. 「結構面白かった」 means it was more than just a little interesting.
    etymology: 「面白かった」 is the past tense of 面白い, meaning 'interesting'.
  - japanese: あの人、結構タイプかも。
    english: That person might be quite my type.
    register: flirty
    setting: observing someone attractive
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「かも」 expresses uncertainty, softening the statement, while 「結構タイプ」 indicates a strong initial
      attraction. This suggests she finds the person considerably appealing.
  - japanese: このレストラン、雰囲気も良くて、料理も結構いけるよ。
    english: This restaurant has a good atmosphere, and the food is quite good, you know.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: recommending a restaurant
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「いける」 is a slightly informal way of saying something is good or acceptable. 「結構いける」 means
      it's noticeably good. The speaker is trying to sound confident in his recommendation.
post_example_writeup: Remember that while 結構 often means "quite" or "rather," its use as 「結構です」 is a very
  common and polite way to say "no, thank you." Pay attention to the context to understand the intended
  meaning.

  - term: なかなか
    meaning: Very, Quite, Considerably
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both 結構 and なかなか can mean "quite," なかなか often carries a nuance of surprise or unexpectedness,
      or implies something is better than initially thought. For example, 「なかなかいいですね」 suggests something
      is surprisingly good, whereas 「結構いいですね」 is a more straightforward statement of its quality.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between 結構 and なかなか, consider whether there's an element
  of surprise or unexpectedness in what you're trying to express. If so, なかなか might be a better fit. If
  you simply want to convey that something is quite a bit of something, 結構 is generally appropriate. Also,
  remember that only 結構 can be used as a standalone phrase to decline something.
