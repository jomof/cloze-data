  The grammar structure **といえばず** indicates that something applies not just to two specific things (A and B), but to everything within a related category. It conveys the meaning of "not just A or B, but everything," or "A, B, and everything else."

  The structure **といえばず** is formed by combining the quotation particle **と**, the negative stem of the verb **\u8a00\u3046** (**\u8a00\u308f**), and the literary negative auxiliary verb **ず**. Literally, it means "without saying A, and without saying B, (and also C, D, etc.)." The phrase "without saying A" implies "without limiting it to A."

  This grammatical form is always used in pairs: **Xと\u8a00\u308f\u305a Yと\u8a00\u308f\u305a**. Both X and Y must belong to the same logical group or category for the sentence to sound natural. For example, hands and feet are parts of the body, morning and afternoon are parts of a day, and the chorus and melody are parts of a song.

  **といえばず** is a relatively formal expression and is not commonly used in everyday conversation.

post_example_writeup: The key to using **といえばず** correctly is ensuring that the nouns you connect with
  it form a coherent group. The structure implies that if something is true for A and B, it's logically
  true for the entire category they belong to. If A and B are unrelated, using **といえばず** will sound unnatural.
