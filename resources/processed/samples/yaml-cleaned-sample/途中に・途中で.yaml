  **途中に** and **途中で** both translate to "on the way", "partway", or "in the middle of". They are used to indicate that something happens during an ongoing action or journey.

  The core of this grammar point is the noun **途中** (tochuu), meaning "on the way" or "midway". Adding the particles **に** (ni) or **で** (de) specifies the nature of this "midway" point.

  Generally, **途中に** emphasizes the **time** or **location** where something occurred. Think of it as pinpointing a moment or place within a process.

  On the other hand, **途中で** emphasizes the **action** or **process** that is interrupted or during which something else happens. It often highlights the ongoing nature of the first activity as the setting for the second.

  The distinction can be subtle, and in many cases, they are interchangeable. However, keeping the emphasis on **time/location (に)** versus **process/action (で)** can be helpful.

  **途中に** often follows verbs in their dictionary form or nouns followed by **の**.

  Consider the nuance. Receiving a text message **途中に** highlights the point in your journey. The president collapsing **途中で** emphasizes the interruption of the ongoing meeting. While often interchangeable, this subtle distinction exists.

  Think of **途中に** as answering "when?" or "where?" within the timeframe of an event. Think of **途中で** as answering "during what action?"

  **最中に** shares the meaning of "in the middle of", but it often suggests a more intense phase of the activity being interrupted. Imagine a crucial moment in a negotiation being broken up – that's where **最中に** fits well.

  **がけに** also translates to "on the way", but it specifically emphasizes the direction of travel. It implies doing something *while going towards* a certain place, adding a sense of purpose and movement that **途中に** and **途中で** don't always have.

  **ているところだ** indicates that an action is happening right now, at this very moment. It's more about capturing a snapshot of an ongoing activity. While something might happen **途中に** or **途中で** an activity, **ているところだ** emphasizes the present, continuous nature of that activity.
