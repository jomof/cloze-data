  The adverb **ほとんど** is used in many situations in Japanese and often translates as "most", "hardly any", "almost all", and similar expressions. The nuance will always depend on the rest of the sentence. The most accurate translation for the word **ほとんど** itself is simply "almost," where the thing it describes is always considered a full group rather than a single thing.

  As with many other adverbs that highlight an "amount" in Japanese, **ほとんど** can modify a whole phrase or be used before **の** to further specify a single noun.

  In negative sentences, **ほとんど** translates as "hardly any". This is mainly because the "full group" that **ほとんど** describes is highlighted as almost "not" existing.

post_example_writeup: Notice how **ほとんど** modifies the noun or phrase that follows it, indicating an amount
  close to the full quantity or very little of it. The context determines whether it means 'almost all'
  or 'hardly any'.
false_friends:
  - term: めったに〜ない
    meaning: Hardly, Rarely, Seldom
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **ほとんど**, **めったに** emphasizes the infrequency of an action or event. While **ほとんど**
      focuses on quantity, **めったに** focuses on frequency. For example, 「ほとんど食べない」 means 'I eat almost
      none', while 「めったに食べない」 means 'I rarely eat'.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **ほとんど** relates to the amount or proportion
  of something, while **めったに** focuses on how often something occurs. They can sometimes overlap in meaning,
  particularly when describing the frequency of an action being close to zero, but their core nuances
  differ.
