  **他に** (hoka ni) basically means "another thing" or "other." The particle **に** (ni) highlights this "other thing" as the focus of the sentence. Let's break down the variations:

  *  **他に (hoka ni):** Simply means "another thing." It's a general way to refer to something else.
  *  **他にも (hoka ni mo):** Means "even another thing." The particle **も** (mo) adds the nuance of addition. It implies there's something already mentioned or understood, and you're adding another possibility. **Important:** As noted in the meaning warning, **他にも** generally cannot be used in negative sentences except for questions.
  *  **他には (hoka ni wa):** Means "as for other things" or "regarding other things." The particle **は** (wa) sets up "other things" as the topic of the sentence. It often implies a comparison or a focus on what else exists or doesn't exist. It's frequently used in negative sentences to emphasize that there are no other options.
  *  **他の + Noun (hoka no + noun):** Means "another [specific noun]." Here, **の** (no) turns **他** into an adjectival phrase modifying the noun.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The restriction on **他にも** in negative sentences is crucial. Remember it focuses on the *addition* of something, which doesn't logically fit with negation in statements.
  *  Negative questions with **他にも** are acceptable because they can carry a nuance similar to "isn't there?"
  *  Using **その他に** (sono hoka ni) means "in addition to that," referring to something previously mentioned.

    nuance: Unlike 「ほかに」, 「いがい」 emphasizes exclusion or exception. For example, 「彼以外は誰も来なかった」 (Except
      for him, nobody came).

    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ほかに」, 「をおいてほかに〜ない」 is a more emphatic construction meaning there's truly no other
      option. For example, 「君をおいてほかに頼れる人はいない」 (There's no one else but you I can rely on).
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「いがい」 and 「をおいてほかに〜ない」 can sometimes seem similar to 「ほかに」, it's important
  to note their specific nuances. 「いがい」 focuses on excluding something, whereas 「ほかに」 simply asks about
  or indicates the existence of other possibilities. 「をおいてほかに〜ない」 is a stronger expression indicating
  a lack of alternatives, whereas 「ほかに」 is generally more neutral.
