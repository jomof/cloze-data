  The combination of the conjunction particle て (or the case-marking particle で), with the adverbial particle も, often has the nuance of "even if (A)", or "even though (A)". To use this structure, simply conjugate a verb or い-Adjective into its て-form, and then add も. For nouns and な-Adjectives, でも will be used instead. This grammar pattern may also be used for highlighting negative sentences, and will translate similarly to "even if not (A)", or "even though not (A)" in these cases.

  **Important Note:** Remember that when connecting nouns or な-adjectives, you use 「でも」, not 「ても」.

  **Fun Fact:** There is often debate amongst native speakers as to whether でも (the form after nouns and な-Adjectives) is actually a word, or simply a standard grouping of で, the case marking particle, and も, the adverbial particle. However, it may be easier to remember でも as its own word for learning purposes.

  expresses concession - that something will happen or be the case regardless of another condition. Expressions
  like 「てもいい」 focus on permission, 「でも」 as a conjunction means "but", and others like 「にしても」 or 「としても」
  have slightly different nuances related to assumption or emphasis. Pay close attention to the context
  to discern the intended meaning.
