writeup: |-
  とみえる (primarily written only in hiragana) is a phrase that combines the case marking particle と with the る-Verb 見える "to appear", or "to be visible". This use of the と particle in Japanese is called a result, and marks when (A) is something that has come to a conclusion, or can be concluded. In this way とみえる literally means "from the way it appears, one can conclude that it's (A)". However, this translates a bit more smoothly as "it can be deduced that (A)", or "it seems that (A)". This expression is always used directly after the phrase that it is drawing as a conclusion. However, nouns and な-Adjectives will require だ before とみえる. While this phrase is conjecture (making a guess about something), it usually implies that the speaker has done some sort of research, or has some reason that led them to "draw (A) as a conclusion". Due to this, it appears reasonably confident.

  Fun Fact: と always "sums up" things. As a quotation, it sums up the phrase before it as either something that was said, or thought. As 一緒 "being together", it sums up groups of things that are existing/performing actions mutually. Lastly, as a result, it sums up causes, and then illustrates their effects.

  - term: ようだ
    meaning: It seems that, It appears that, It looks like
    kind: synonym

      implying a strong deduction based on evidence.
  - term: らしい ①
    meaning: Seems like, Apparently, I heard
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both can express conjecture, 「らしい」 often indicates information obtained indirectly,
      such as through rumors or hearsay, whereas 「とみえる」 suggests a conclusion drawn from direct observation
      or evidence.
  - term: にみえる
    meaning: To look, To seem, To appear
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「にみえる」 focuses more on the visual aspect of something appearing a certain way. 「とみえる」 emphasizes
      the deduction or conclusion drawn from the observed situation.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「とみえる」 with similar expressions, remember that 「とみえる」 specifically
  implies a conclusion drawn based on some form of evidence or reasoning. 「ようだ」 is a more general way
  of saying something seems to be the case. 「らしい」 often suggests information from an external source.
  「にみえる」 is about visual appearance.
