details:

  使用域: 一般
writeup: とみえる (primarily written only in hiragana) is a phrase that combines the case marking particle
  と with the る-Verb 見える, meaning "to appear" or "to be visible." This use of the と particle in Japanese
  indicates a **result**, marking when something has been concluded or can be concluded. In this way,
  とみえる literally means, "from the way it appears, one can conclude that it's (A)." However, this translates
  more smoothly as "it can be deduced that (A)" or "it seems that (A)." This expression is always used
  directly after the phrase from which the conclusion is drawn. Nouns and な-Adjectives require だ before
  とみえる. While this phrase expresses conjecture (making a guess about something), it usually implies that
  the speaker has done some research or has a reason that led them to draw conclusion (A). Due to this,
  it sounds reasonably confident. It's interesting to note that と often "sums up" things. As a quotation
  marker, it sums up the preceding phrase as something said or thought. As 一緒に ("together"), it sums up
  groups of things existing or performing actions mutually. And as a marker of result, it sums up causes
  and illustrates their effects.

    meaning: To look, To seem, To appear
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「とみえる」, 「に見える」 describes a visual appearance or impression. It focuses on how something
      looks, not necessarily a conclusion drawn from evidence.
