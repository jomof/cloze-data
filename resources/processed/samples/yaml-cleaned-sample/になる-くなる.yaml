writeup: '`～になる` (with な-Adjectives) or `～くなる` (with い-Adjectives) is used to express the idea of "becoming
  (an adjective)" in Japanese. You attach it directly to the stem of the adjective. For な-adjectives,
  you remove the な, and for い-adjectives, you remove the い. The verb `なる` can be conjugated into various
  forms to indicate tense and politeness, such as `なります` (polite non-past), `なりました` (polite past), `ならなかった`
  (plain negative past), and so on. For example, something *will become* difficult, *is becoming* difficult,
  or *has become* difficult. Even negative forms can be used to express that something ''will not become
  (A)''. The example of tea getting cold illustrates how `ている` can emphasize the ongoing state after the
  change. It implies "the tea has gotten cold and remains cold." A key exception to the い-adjective conjugation
  rule is the adjective `いい` ("good"), which becomes `よくなる` and not `いくなる`.'

post_example_writeup: Remember that when using い-adjectives, the final い is dropped before adding くなる.
  For な-adjectives, the final な is dropped before adding になる. Also, be mindful of the special case of
  いい, which becomes よくなる.

  - term: てくる
    meaning: To come to, To become, To continue, To be starting to, Has been ~ing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「～になる・～くなる」 which focuses on the change of state to an adjective, 「てくる」 indicates a
      change or a movement that comes towards the speaker or a point in time. For example, 「寒くなってきました
      (It has started to get cold)」 implies a gradual process becoming noticeable.
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「～になる・～くなる」 and 「てくる」 can sometimes translate to "become," it's
  important to distinguish their nuances. Use 「～になる・～くなる」 when you want to emphasize the resulting state
  of being a certain adjective. Use 「てくる」 when describing a process that is unfolding or moving towards
  the present.
