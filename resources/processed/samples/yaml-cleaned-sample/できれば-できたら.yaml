writeup: できれば and できたら both translate to "if possible." They are derived from the potential form of the
  verb する (to do), which is できる (can do). The addition of the conditional endings ば or たら creates the
  nuance of possibility or a desired condition. They are used to soften a request or express a preference,
  acknowledging that the desired outcome might not be feasible. **Important Considerations:** While both
  are largely interchangeable, できれば is generally perceived as slightly more formal than できたら. Both appear
  at the beginning of a sentence, setting the condition for the subsequent statement.
