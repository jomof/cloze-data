writeup: |-
  To express the beginning of an action in Japanese, you use the verb **始める (hajimeru)**, meaning "to start" or "to begin". You attach 始める to the ます-stem of another verb to indicate that the action of that verb is starting.

  For example, to say "to start eating," you would take the ます-stem of the verb 食べる (taberu, to eat), which is 食べ (tabe), and add 始める, resulting in 食べ始める (tabehajimeru).

  Both the hiragana (はじめる) and kanji (始める) forms are acceptable and carry the same nuance.

  Since 始める is itself a verb, you can conjugate it to indicate different tenses:

  *  **始める (hajimeru):** will start, starts (present/future tense)
  *  **始めた (hajimeta):** started (past tense)
  *  **始めている (hajimete iru):** is starting (progressive aspect)

  **Important Consideration:** Be careful not to confuse 始める (hajimeru, transitive) with 始まる (hajimaru, intransitive). When using this grammar point, you will always use the transitive form 始める because the verb it's attached to is the action being initiated.
