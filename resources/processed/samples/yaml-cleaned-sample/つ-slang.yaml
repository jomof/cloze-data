writeup: |-
  **つ** is a slang grammar pattern that originates from **という**, with the meaning of "called (A)", "that (A) that was said", or "known as (A)". Basically, it just quotes something that was previously said. **つ** may also be seen as **っつ**, or even **つう**. Remember, **という** is just a combination of the quotation particle **と**, and **言う**, the う-Verb meaning "to say". As **と** is the quotation particle, **つ** can follow almost any statement or word type.

  Although **つ** is very strong slang, it is very common. You can often hear native speakers saying **という** with various degrees of abbreviation, with **つ** being the shortest possible.

  The pause in the **っつ** version may indicate that the speaker is annoyed or running out of patience, but this is not always the case.

  **Caution**

  Just because **言う** disappears when said as **つ**, it doesn't mean that standard conjugation rules also disappear. If you want to highlight that something "was said" in past tense, or "is being said" in progressive form, structures like **つった** or **つってん** will be used. **ている** becoming **てん** is explained more closely in the ん slang lesson.
