writeup: The imperative form 「たまえ」 comes from the う-verb 「給う」, which means "to give" or "to bestow." When
  attached to the ます-stem of verbs, 「たまえ」 creates a mild order or request, often translated as "please
  do (A)." **Important Considerations:** 「たまえ」 is exclusively used by speakers addressing individuals
  of lower status. This power dynamic is usually clear, such as between a boss and a subordinate, or a
  teacher and a student. It is predominantly used by men. Historically, 「たまえ」 was also used in prayers
  to request favors or the granting of wishes. However, this usage is now mostly found in literary works.
