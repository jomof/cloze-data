writeup: 「ではなくて」 and its more casual counterpart 「じゃなくて」 are used to state that something is not A, but
  rather B. Think of it as a way to provide a correction or clarification. The 「て」 at the end functions
  similarly to a comma, linking the two parts of the sentence. While 「ではなく」 can be used, adding 「て」 makes
  the connection smoother and more natural in spoken Japanese. The particle 「は」 can often be included
  after the noun or phrase being negated (e.g., 「メールではなくて」), emphasizing the contrast. 「じゃなくて」 is a very
  common colloquial alternative to 「ではなくて」.

false_friends:
  - term: なくて (not)
    meaning: Not ~ and, Not so, Because not (Examples)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ではなくて・じゃなくて」 which explicitly contrasts two things, 「なくて」 often expresses a simple
      negative reason or state. For example, 「お金がなくて、買えません。」 (Because I don't have money, I can't buy
      it.).
  - term: なくて (not)
    meaning: To not ~ and ~, Not ~ and ~ (Conjugations)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both can express negation, 「ではなくて・じゃなくて」 has the specific function of correcting or
      clarifying, whereas 「なくて」 in this context is used for sequential actions or states. For example,
      「宿題をしないで、遊びに行った。」 (Without doing homework, I went to play.).
  - term: 連用形
    meaning: Formal Conjunctive
    kind: synonym
    nuance: The 連用形 (masu-stem) of verbs can connect clauses, but it doesn't carry the specific nuance
      of correction or contrast that 「ではなくて・じゃなくて」 does. For instance, 「勉強して、寝ます。」 (I will study and then
      sleep.).
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「ではなくて・じゃなくて」 always presents an alternative.
  If you're simply stating a negative reason or connecting actions without contrast, use other grammatical
  forms like 「〜なくて」 or the verb's 連用形.
