  The particle **を** marks the direct object of a verb. Think of it like this: the verb is the action, and **を** points to the thing or person that the action is being done *to*. For example, in the sentence 「**漢字を**覚える。」, "kanji" is what is being memorized, so it's marked with **を**.

  Interestingly, **を** can also mark the place through which movement occurs. This is common with verbs like 歩く (to walk), 走る (to run), 飛ぶ (to fly), and 渡る (to cross). In this case, the emphasis is on the action happening *within* that location. For instance, 「**公園を**散歩する」 means walking *in* the park.

post_example_writeup: Remember that **を** always comes after the noun it's marking as the object. It's
  a crucial particle for understanding the basic structure of Japanese sentences.

  - term: が (subject marker)
    meaning: Subject marking particle, Identification particle
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **を**, **が** marks the subject of a sentence, the one *doing* the action. It can also
      be used to identify or emphasize a particular noun.
post_false_friends_writeup: The key difference between **を** and **が** is their role in the sentence.
  **を** indicates the receiver of the action (the object), while **が** indicates the performer of the
  action (the subject). Pay attention to what's doing and what's being done to understand which particle
  to use.
