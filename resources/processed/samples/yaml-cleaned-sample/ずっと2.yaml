  In addition to ずっと used to mean "always" or "non-stop", this adverb may also convey that one thing is **by far (A)**, or **much more (A)** than something else. In these phrases, ずっと usually comes at the beginning of the sentence, before some form of comparison is made between (A) and (B).

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  ずっと emphasizes a significant difference or interval between the compared items.
  *  It is often used with comparative adjectives or adverbs.
