  Register: Formal
  使用域: 硬い
etymology: The particle 「わ」 is an emphatic form of the adverbial particle 「は」. The repetition 「わ〜わ」 further
  emphasizes the quantity or frequency of the action.
writeup: The 「わ〜わ」 grammar point is used to emphasize a large quantity or something happening repeatedly.
  It often conveys the speaker's surprise or feeling that something is happening excessively. You'll often
  see it translated as "more and more," "keeps on happening," or "so much." This structure involves repeating
  a verb in its dictionary form, followed by the 「わ」 particle each time. For **suru verbs**, the second
  instance of the verb is often shortened to just 「する」, like 「勉強するわするわ」 instead of 「勉強するわ勉強するわ」. While
  predominantly used by men, women may also use it. Think of it as a stronger, more emphatic version of
  saying "as for (A), it did (A)," with the repetition amplifying the feeling.
