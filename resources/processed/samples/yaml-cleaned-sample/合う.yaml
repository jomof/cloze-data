writeup: |-
  When following the conjunctive form of another verb, the う-Verb 合う means to do that action in concert with another person/group. This is often translated as "to mutually do (A)", or "to do (A) for one another". Realistically, it just means "to do (A) reciprocally", with involvement from both sides being required. In this usage, 合う is considered to be a suffix. This construction is often used with expressions like お互いに "mutually", which simply emphasizes the point.

  **Fun Fact:** While 合う is regularly translated as "to fit", or "to meet" in English, its meaning is somewhat broader in Japanese. 合う means to perform an action "as one", where it is not possible (or would be difficult) to complete the action by oneself. Due to this, it is regularly used to describe ideal situations in which individuals should be doing something together, without thinking about their own personal gain.

  **Caution:** 合う may also be used in regard to sports/contests. In these cases, it may seem like players are not doing the action "for" each other, but involvement from both sides is required to make the act possible.

post_example_writeup: The ～合う construction highlights the reciprocal nature of an action. It implies that
  the action is done by multiple parties towards each other. Understanding the core meaning of 合う as 'coming
  together' or 'being one' helps grasp its use in these compound verbs.
false_friends:
  - term: と共に
    meaning: Together with, At the same time, As well as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 合う, 「と共に」 doesn't necessarily imply a reciprocal action. It can simply mean doing something
      at the same time or being in the company of someone while performing an action individually. For
      example, you can 「友達と共に出かける」(go out with a friend), where the act of going out isn't necessarily
      a mutual or reciprocal action in the same way as 「話し合う」(to discuss with each other).
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「と共に」 and 「合う」 can both indicate togetherness, it's important to distinguish
  the nuance of reciprocity. 「合う」 always involves a mutual exchange or interaction, whereas 「と共に」 is broader
  and can simply mean 'along with' or 'at the same time as' without the implication of doing something
  *to* each other.
