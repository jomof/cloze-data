  Making use of the う-Verb まつわる "to coil around", にまつわる is a formal grammar pattern that follows nouns and expresses that something broadly discusses the topic of (A). It is usually translated as "surrounding (A)", "associated with (A)", or "connected to (A)". In most cases, まつわる will be both preceded and followed by a noun, with the preceding noun being the topic, and the following noun being the thing that is dealing with that topic. まつわる itself is primarily seen when (B) is some sort of information or explanation related to (A). Because of this, 話 "tale", 物語 "story", 伝説 "legend", 神話 "myth", and similar words will often appear as (B).

  **Fun Fact:** 纏わる shares the same kanji as 纏まる, another common verb that means "to come together", or "to consolidate". Although the kanji itself is rarely used outside of books, it may help to remember the nuance being conveyed in まつわる of "coming together". This 'coming together around (A)', or simply 'surrounding (A)' translates the feeling of the structure quite accurately.
