writeup: |-
  **そうすると** is a conjunction that essentially means "having done that" or "if that is done." It's formed from **そう** (like that) + **する** (to do) + the conjunction particle **と**.

  Think of it as a way to say, "Because of what was just mentioned, the following happens." It highlights a natural consequence or a logical conclusion based on a previous statement.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  The "result" that **そうすると** introduces is usually something the speaker doesn't directly control or a conclusion they want to confirm.
  *  When used to confirm understanding, it can translate to something like, "So you mean...?" or "If that's the case, then...?"
  *  Although **然う** is the kanji form of **そう**, **そうすると** is almost always written in hiragana. This is common with many expressions containing **そう**.

false_friends:
  - term: すると
    meaning: Having done..., If...is done..., (And/just) then, Thereupon, If so
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While **すると** is very similar in meaning to **そうすると**, **そうすると** adds a slightly stronger
      emphasis on the connection to the preceding action or situation. **すると** is a more general conjunction
      for expressing sequence or consequence.
  - term: と (quotation)
    meaning: If, When, Whenever, And, [Conditional]
    kind: synonym
    nuance: The conditional particle **と** can also express 'if' or 'when', but it generally implies a
      more direct and expected consequence or a natural law. **そうすると** emphasizes a consequence specifically
      tied to the previously mentioned action.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **そうすると** specifically refers back to the
  action or situation described in the previous sentence. It highlights a consequence that directly results
  from that specific action. While **すると** and **と** can also indicate consequence, they have broader
  uses and don't always have the same specific emphasis on the preceding action as **そうすると**.
