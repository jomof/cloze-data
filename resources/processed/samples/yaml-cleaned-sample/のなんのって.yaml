etymology: 'The structure のなんのって consists of: the case marking particle の; the pre-noun adjectival 何の
  (nan no) ''what kind of''; and って (tte), an abbreviation of という (to iu) ''to say''. The literal sense
  of ''and to say it''s (A) or something'' emphasizes that something is so (A) that the speaker finds
  it difficult to describe otherwise. It is a condensed variation of ～の～ないのって, which carries a similar
  meaning but explicitly states the adjective in both positive and negative forms.'
writeup: のなんのって is a casual phrase primarily used in spoken Japanese to emphasize that something is "excessively
  (A)" or "extremely (A)." This structure typically appears after い-adjectives, な-adjectives (followed
  by な), and verbs. The phrase is a condensed form of ～の～ないのって, which has the same meaning but includes
  the adjective in both its positive and negative forms, creating a sense of extreme emphasis. The expression
  ～の～ないのって translates roughly to "to say it's (A) or not (A), (B)," where (B) often explains the extent
  of (A). Sometimes (B) is omitted, as ～の～ないのって inherently means "extremely (A)."
