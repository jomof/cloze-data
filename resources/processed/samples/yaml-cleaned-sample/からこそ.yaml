writeup: The particle **こそ** is used to emphasize the preceding word or phrase, highlighting its importance.
  When combined with the conjunction **から**, it creates **からこそ**, which emphasizes the **reason** for
  something. It conveys a sense of "precisely because" or "especially because." This structure is primarily
  used after verbs in their dictionary form or after nouns followed by **だ**. **からこそ** indicates that
  among several possible reasons, the one stated is the most significant or compelling.
