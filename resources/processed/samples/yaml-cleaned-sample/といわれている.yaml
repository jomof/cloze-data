writeup: といわれている is often translated as "it is said that (A)" or "it is known that (A)." Similar to とされている,
  it's a construction that combines the case-marking particle と with the passive form of a verb to indicate
  a commonly held or public opinion. In this case, the verb is 言う (iu - to say). However, unlike とされている
  which emphasizes a **result**, といわれている emphasizes a **quotation** or a piece of information that's being
  passed around. To use といわれている, attach it to the end of a phrase you want to express as something commonly
  said. This grammar point is frequently seen both with and without the kanji for 言う, as the meaning remains
  the same regardless.

  - term: そうだ
    meaning: I heard that, It is said that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike といわれている, そうだ is a more direct way of relaying information heard from someone. It focuses
      on the speaker's source rather than a general public opinion.
  - term: とかんがえられている
    meaning: Is considered, Is thought of as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike といわれている, と考えられている emphasizes a more formal or academic consideration or thought process,
      often based on evidence or analysis.
  - term: という (each)
    meaning: Called, Named, Known as, As much as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike といわれている, という (in this context) is used to define or name something. It doesn't necessarily
      imply a widespread opinion or saying.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that といわれている specifically highlights information
  that is commonly said or known publicly. そうだ indicates information heard by the speaker. と考えられている suggests
  a more considered opinion, and という is used for definition or naming.
