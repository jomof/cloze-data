etymology: This grammar point is formed from the quotative particle 「と」, the verb 「言う (いう)」 in its passive
  form 「言われる (いわれる)」, and the いる-form 「いる」, indicating a continuous state. Literally, it means "it is
  in a state of being said."
writeup: |-
  「といわれている」 is used to express **commonly held beliefs, public opinions, or widely known facts**. It translates to "it is said that (A)" or "is known as (A)". It's similar to 「とされている」 but emphasizes the act of **quotation** or **hearsay** rather than a formally established result. You attach 「といわれている」 to the end of a phrase to indicate that the information is something generally reported or believed.

  *  You'll often see 「と言われている」 written with or without the kanji for 「言う」; the meaning remains the same.
  *  This construction is quite common in everyday conversation and writing to convey information that isn't necessarily your own personal opinion but rather a generally accepted view.

false_friends:
  - term: そうだ
    meaning: I heard that, It is said that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「といわれている」 which emphasizes a more general, widely accepted saying, 「そうだ」 often implies
      the speaker received the information more directly, from a specific source. It feels less like established
      knowledge and more like recent hearsay.
  - term: とかんがえられている
    meaning: Is considered, Is thought of as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「といわれている」 focuses on what is said, 「とかんがえられている」 emphasizes a process of consideration
      or thought. It suggests a more analytical or evaluative perspective on the information.
  - term: という (each)
    meaning: Called, Named, Known as, As much as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: When used to mean 'called' or 'named', 「という」 is used to define or identify something directly.
      「といわれている」, on the other hand, reports on a reputation or belief about something, not necessarily
      its formal name.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「といわれている」 with similar expressions, remember that 「といわれている」
  highlights the aspect of something being 'said' or 'reported'. 「そうだ」 feels more like direct information,
  「とかんがえられている」 focuses on consideration, and 「という」 (for names) is about identification. Consider the nuance
  of whether you're reporting a widely held opinion or conveying a slightly different shade of meaning.
