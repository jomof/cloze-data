writeup: へ is a particle used to indicate the **direction or destination of movement**. It signifies that
  someone or something is moving 'to' or 'toward' a specific place. While often interchangeable with the
  particle に, へ places a slight emphasis on the **process or direction of movement** itself, rather than
  just the endpoint. Think of it as highlighting the journey or effort involved in reaching the destination.
  へ always follows the noun indicating the destination.
