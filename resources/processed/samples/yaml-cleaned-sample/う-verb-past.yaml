  To express the past tense of a う-verb in Japanese, similar to other conjugations of う-verbs, you need to modify the final kana before adding the auxiliary verb 「た」 (casual) or 「ました」 (polite). The changes for the casual past tense are specific and are the same as the 「て」 form endings, but with 「た」 instead: 「った」, 「いた」, 「いだ」, 「んだ」, 「した」. For verbs where the 「て」 form ends in 「で」, the past tense uses 「だ」 instead of 「た」. This is a historical sound change to improve pronunciation flow, not the auxiliary verb 「だ」 itself.

  For the polite past tense of う-verbs, the conjugation is more consistent. You change the final 「う」 sound of the dictionary form to the corresponding 「い」 sound in the same vowel column (e.g., 「う」 becomes 「い」, 「く」 becomes 「き」). Then, add 「ました」.

  When 「た」 is added to verbs, it indicates one of three meanings:

  *  **Past (過去):** The action occurred at some point in the past (did/was).
  *  **Completion (完了):** The action has finished (done).
  *  **Continuation (存続):** A new state resulting from a completed action that continues (has been done).

  **Important Consideration:**

  There are some irregular う-verbs that do not follow these standard conjugation rules. Refer to a comprehensive conjugation guide for these exceptions.

post_false_friends_writeup: It's crucial to distinguish between the past tense of verbs and other related
  grammatical forms. While they might seem similar in that they describe something that happened before
  now, their grammatical function and usage differ significantly. For example, the 「て」 form connects ideas,
  while 「だった」/「でした」 are for nouns and na-adjectives. Paying attention to the verb endings and the overall
  sentence structure will help you use these forms correctly.
