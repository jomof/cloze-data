  「まみれ」, usually written in hiragana, is a grammar pattern that indicates being **completely covered in (A)**, **smeared all over with (A)**, or **stained with (A)**. It directly follows nouns. When modifying another noun, it appears as 「まみれの」. In most cases, 「まみれ」 is used for things that are negative or perceived negatively, such as blood, mud, oil, or even non-physical things like debt 「借金 (しゃっきん)」 or desires 「欲 (よく)」.

  **Fun Fact:** 「まみれ」 is the noun form of the verb 「塗れる (まみれる)」 (a る-verb), which comes from the same kanji as 「塗る (ぬる)」 meaning "to paint". Similar to "to paint", 「まみれる」 and 「まみれ」 primarily describe something covering the outer surface of another object, rather than its contents.
