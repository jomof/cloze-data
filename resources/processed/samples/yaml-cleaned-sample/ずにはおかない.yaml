writeup: |-
  ずにはおかない is a combination of the classical auxiliary verb ず, the case-marking particle に, the adverbial particle は, and the standard negated form of the う-Verb 措く, 措かない, ‘to set aside', or ‘to leave as is'. It is interpreted as ‘(A) will definitely happen', or ‘I will not fail to (A)'. This is a formal expression that literally means ‘I cannot leave it as it is with (A) undone', and therefore indicates **strong will** to complete the action that is reflected in the standard translations.

  As this structure begins with ず, it will only be used with verbs.

  Alternatively, ないでは may replace ず. This will be seen as ないではおかない. However, the meaning will not change at all.

  **Caution**
  Due to this grammar expression showing strong will to not give up until (A) is done, it will often be used with causative verbs in (A). This indicates that the speaker is determined not to quit until they can make another person do something.
