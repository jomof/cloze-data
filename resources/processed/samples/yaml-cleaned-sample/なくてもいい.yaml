writeup: なくてもいい is the negative counterpart to てもいい, indicating that it's **acceptable not to do something**.
  It conveys a sense of permission or lack of obligation, similar to saying "you don't have to worry about
  doing (A)". The structure combines the te-form of the negative auxiliary verb ない (なくて) with いい (good/okay).
  In more casual speech, the particle も can be omitted, resulting in なくてもいい becoming なくてもいい. This doesn't
  change the meaning but adds a touch of informality and friendliness.

      necessary.

    nuance: The speaker uses the casual 「～よ」 and the slightly concerned tone about the listener getting
      drunk, which can be perceived as flirty in the right context. The phrase 「酔っ払っちゃうよ」 is a casual
      way of saying 'you'll get drunk'.
    etymology: 「酔っ払う」 means 'to get drunk'.
post_example_writeup: Remember that while both なくてもいい and なくてもいい mean the same thing, the version without
  the も is considered more casual and intimate. Use it with people you know well.
false_friends:
  - term: なくてはいけない
    meaning: Must do, Have to do
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike なくてもいい, which indicates a lack of obligation, なくてはいけない signifies a **necessity or obligation**
      to do something.
  - term: てはいけない
    meaning: Must not, May not
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While てはいけない expresses **prohibition**, meaning something is not allowed, なくてもいい indicates
      a **lack of obligation**, meaning something is not required. They are used in different contexts.
  - term: てはならない
    meaning: Must not, Cannot, Should not
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to てはいけない, てはならない expresses a **stronger prohibition** than なくてもいい, which simply states
      a lack of necessity.
  - term: ことはない
    meaning: There is no need to, Never happens
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ことはない also means "there is no need to", similar to なくてもいい. However, ことはない can also mean "it's
      not the case that..." or "it never happens", which なくてもいい cannot express.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that なくてもいい focuses on the **option of not doing
  something**, whereas なくてはいけない emphasizes the **requirement to do something**. The 「てはいけない/てはならない」 forms
  express **prohibition**, and 「ことはない」 indicates **lack of necessity** but can also have other meanings
  related to possibility or frequency.
