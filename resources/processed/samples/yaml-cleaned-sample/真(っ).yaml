writeup: |-
  The prefix 真(ま), derived from the kanji 真 meaning "true", is attached to words to emphasize that something is **completely**, **exactly**, or **genuinely**. The form of 真 changes depending on the initial sound of the following word. This change is based on the *gojūon* (五十音, the Japanese syllabary) chart.

  *  When 真 is followed by a word starting with a sound from the **ま-column** (ま, み, む, め, も) or the **な-column** (な, に, ぬ, ね, の), 真 becomes 真(まん).
  *  When 真 is followed by a word starting with a sound from the **か-column** (か, き, く, け, こ), **さ-column** (さ, し, す, せ, そ), or a **しゃ-sound** (しゃ, しゅ, しょ), 真 becomes 真(まっ).
  *  When 真 is followed by a word starting with a sound from the **は-column** (は, ひ, ふ, へ, ほ), 真 becomes 真(まっ), and the initial sound of the following word changes to a **p-sound**.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  There are exceptions to these rules.
  *  When 真 is attached to 青い (あおい, blue), it becomes 真っ青 (まっさお).
  *  When 真 is attached to 赤い (あかい, red), it becomes 真っ赤 (まっか).
