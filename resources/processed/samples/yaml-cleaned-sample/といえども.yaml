grammar_point: といえども
jlpt: N1
meaning: Even (if), Although, Even though
details:
  Register: Formal
  使用域: 硬い
writeup: 'The grammar point **といえども** combines the particle **と**, the hypothetical form of the verb **言う
  (いう)** which is **言え (いえ)**, and the conjunction particle **ども**. While literally translating to something
  like "even if one were to say (A)," it''s more naturally translated as "even if (A)" or "although (A)."
  You''ll find **といえども** following nouns, い-adjectives, and verbs in their plain form. When used with
  な-adjectives, **だ** precedes **といえども**. Think of **といえども** as a very formal and somewhat old-fashioned
  equivalent of **と言っても (といっても)**. Because of its formality, it often adds emphasis and frequently appears
  with words like **いくら (ikura)** "however much," **いかに (ikani)** "however," or **どんなに (donnani)** "no
  matter how." An interesting tidbit: although rare, you might encounter **いえども** written as **雖も**. The
  kanji **雖 (sui)** means "however." This older form, literally "however even (A)," has largely converged
  in meaning with the more modern "even if one were to say (A)."'
