writeup: |-
  **をよそに** expresses that the speaker is setting aside or ignoring a certain situation (X) while describing another action (Y). It conveys the idea of doing something without regard for the surrounding circumstances. Literally, it suggests "putting X in another place, and then Y." This structure connects to nouns or nominalized phrases using **の**. Because of its formal nature, it appears more frequently in written Japanese.

  The typical pattern involves (X) representing a general condition or prevailing sentiment, and (Y) describing an action taken without considering X. This often carries a critical tone, implying irresponsibility.

  **Important Note:** While this grammar point describes the actions of others, it is not used to describe the speaker's own actions.

post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in the examples, **をよそに** often carries a nuance of criticism or
  disapproval. The action described in the second part of the sentence (Y) is often seen as disregarding
  something important or necessary expressed in the first part (X). Notice how the example marked "Unnatural
  Japanese" sounds odd because it refers to the speaker's own action, which is generally avoided with
  this grammar point. The additional examples further illustrate the range of situations where **をよそに**
  can be applied, emphasizing the act of proceeding without consideration for a particular circumstance.

  - grammar_point: をものともせず
    nuance: Emphasizes overcoming a difficult or challenging situation.
post_false_friends_writeup: While **をよそに**, **にもかかわらず**, and **をものともせず** all convey a sense of something
  happening despite another factor, their nuances differ. **にもかかわらず** focuses on the contrast or unexpectedness
  of the outcome given the preceding situation. For instance, "雨にもかかわらず、試合は開催された" (Despite the rain, the
  match was held) highlights the surprising fact that the match occurred despite the rain. **をものともせず**
  emphasizes resilience and the ability to overcome adversity. An example would be "困難をものともせず、彼は目標を達成した"
  (Undeterred by difficulties, he achieved his goal). This phrase stresses the act of not being defeated
  by the challenge. In contrast, **をよそに** specifically highlights the act of ignoring or disregarding
  a situation, often with a critical undertone about the lack of consideration. To avoid confusion, consider
  whether the focus is on the surprising outcome, the act of overcoming difficulty, or the deliberate
  ignoring of circumstances.
