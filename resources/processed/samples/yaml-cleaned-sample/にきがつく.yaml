  に気が付く is a common expression that highlights when someone "notices that (A)", or "realizes that (A)". 付く "to be attached" is the intransitive form of 付ける "to attach", meaning that it is something that happens by itself. The case marking particle に marks the "location" to where your 気 (sometimes interpreted as "attention") becomes attached. This structure may be used after nouns, or verbs that have been nominalized with either の, or こと.

  **Fun Fact:** There are many different translations for 気 in English. These can range from "spirit", to "attention", to "will", or even "consciousness". However, perhaps one of the most accurate ways to translate 気, is "presence of mind". The "location" to which your focus, attention, or perception is drawn, will always highlight your 気.
