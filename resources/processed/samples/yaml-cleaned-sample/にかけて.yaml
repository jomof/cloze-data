  The grammar point **にかけて** indicates that something happens **over a period of time**, spanning **from one point to another**. Think of it as drawing a line or an arc connecting two time points. It's formed by the particle **に** marking the starting point and the verb **かける (掛ける)** meaning "to hang" or "to span", conjugated into its te-form. The literal image is like something being 'hung' or extended across a period. This pattern emphasizes the duration between the two points. It's commonly used with time expressions, such as days, months, or years.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Emphasis on duration:** Unlike other expressions that might simply state two separate times, **にかけて** highlights the continuous period between them.
  *  **Written language:** While understandable in spoken Japanese, **にかけて** is more frequently seen in written materials, especially news reports regarding weather or events extending over a period.
  *  **Contrast with にかけては:** Be careful not to confuse **にかけて** with **にかけては**. The latter, as noted in the meaning warning, signifies "when it comes to" or "regarding" and highlights someone's expertise or a specific topic. The addition of **は** completely changes the meaning.
  *  **Nuance with にかけては:** When **は** follows **にかけて**, like in 「朝にかけては」, it introduces a contrast. It limits the scope and often implies a difference before or after that period. For example, 「今は雨が降っているが、朝にかけては晴れるでしょう。」 doesn't just mean it will be sunny in the morning, but also contrasts it with the current rainy situation.

post_example_writeup: Notice how the examples demonstrate the usage of **にかけて** to indicate a timeframe.
  The particle **に** marks the starting point, and **かけて** extends that point to the end of the specified
  period. Also, pay attention to the nuance introduced when **は** is added after **にかけて**, which narrows
  the focus and often implies a contrast.

    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **にかけて**, **にかけては** highlights someone's skill or a specific topic. For example, 「歌にかけては、彼女の右に出る者はいない」
      (When it comes to singing, no one can surpass her).
  - term: にわたって
    meaning: Across, Throughout, Extends, Over (a period of time or range)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to **にかけて**, **にわたって** often emphasizes a wider scope or a more comprehensive
      coverage. For example, 「会議は３日間にわたって行われた」 (The meeting was held over a period of three days).
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that **にかけて** focuses on the duration between
  two points in time. **にかけては** shifts the focus to a specific topic or skill. **にわたって** also describes
  a duration, but often with a sense of broader coverage or extent. Think of **にかけて** as a line connecting
  two points in time, **にかけては** as shining a spotlight on a particular area, and **にわたって** as covering
  a wide area or a longer duration.
