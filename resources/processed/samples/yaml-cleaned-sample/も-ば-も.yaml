  *  For verbs, use the **ば-form** (conditional form). For example, 話す → 話せば.
  *  For い-adjectives, also use the **ば-form**. For example, 高い → 高ければ.
  *  For な-adjectives and nouns, use **ならば** or **なら**. For example, 暇 → 暇なら or 暇ならば.

  The second part is marked with **も** and follows with the related quality or action. It's important that the two elements connected by **も～ば～も** have a logical or thematic connection. They should generally share a positive, negative, or neutral connotation.
