writeup: The grammar point 「なかなか～ない」 expresses that something is **not easily done**, **doesn't happen
  as expected**, or is **far from a certain state**. When 「なかなか」 is used with a negative verb form (ない),
  it conveys a sense of something **not progressing smoothly** or meeting expectations. It often implies
  a mild sense of **surprise** or **frustration** that the expected outcome is not being realized. While
  「なかなか」 can mean "very" in positive sentences, the addition of the negative changes its meaning entirely.
  You'll often see it describing situations where you'd anticipate a certain result, but it's just not
  happening. The kanji form for 「なかなか」 is 中々, literally meaning "middle middle." One way to think about
  this is that the desired outcome isn't in the "middle" or the expected place.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「なかなか」 by itself is positive, whereas 「なかなか～ない」
  is used for negative situations. When comparing with other negative expressions, consider the specific
  nuance you want to convey. 「全く」 and 「少しも」 are stronger negations. 「あまり」 indicates a low degree, while
  「なかなか」 often adds the implication of difficulty or unmet expectations. 「別に」 expresses indifference,
  and 「めったに」 emphasizes infrequency. Choosing the right expression depends on the specific context and
  the degree of negation or difficulty you wish to convey.
