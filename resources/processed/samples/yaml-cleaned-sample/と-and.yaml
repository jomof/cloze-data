etymology: The particle と originates from the classical Japanese conjunctive particle meaning 'if'. Over
  time, it also began to be used to indicate conjunctions, eventually solidifying its role as the modern
  'and'.
writeup: と is a particle that is often thought of as meaning "and" in English, which is usually how it
  can be translated. In a broader sense, と simply shows that there is a relationship of 'compilation'
  between (A) and (B). That relationship could be existing together (translated as "and"), or performing
  an action together (translated as "with"). In this case, we will focus on the "and" translation. A full
  description of と as "with" can be found elsewhere. と is required after every noun that it is grouped
  with. However, the last と in a sentence will often be omitted if there are several. In conversation,
  the last と will almost always be omitted.

post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up と with similar expressions, remember that と is a basic
  "and" connecting nouns. Use や when you want to imply there are other items not listed. も indicates "also"
  or "too," while と共に suggests being together in some manner. につれて implies a relationship, and および is
  used for more formal contexts.
