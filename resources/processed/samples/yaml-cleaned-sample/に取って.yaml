etymology: The grammar point にとって comes from the verb 取る (とる), meaning "to take" or "to consider". The
  に particle indicates a direction or target, so literally, にとって can be understood as "taking towards"
  or "considering from the perspective of".
writeup: |-
  にとって (written as に取って when using kanji) is used to express a viewpoint, opinion, or judgment from a particular person or thing's perspective. It's similar to saying "to (someone)", "for (someone)", or "concerning (something)". Think of it as highlighting the **standpoint** from which something is being evaluated.

  **Key Usage Points:**

  *  It attaches directly to a noun or noun phrase.
  *  It frequently follows names and pronouns but can also be used with general nouns.
  *  It shares a similar meaning with から見て ("from the perspective of").

  Essentially, にとって helps to clarify whose viewpoint is being represented in the statement.
