  **つまり** (or 詰まり) is a Japanese word frequently used as an adverb. It's used to summarize a previous statement, whether it was made by the speaker or someone else. This translates to English as "in short," "in other words," "to sum up," and similar expressions.

  **Etymology**: Interestingly, **つまり** comes from the verb **詰まる (tsumaru)**, which means "to become packed" or "condensed." This etymology beautifully reflects the way **つまり** is used to condense or pack previous information into a concise summary.
