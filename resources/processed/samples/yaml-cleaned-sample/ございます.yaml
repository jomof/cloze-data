writeup: ございます is a polite expression meaning "to be" or "to exist." It's derived from the verb ござる (御座る
  in kanji) combined with the polite auxiliary verb ます. While ござる itself is rarely used in modern everyday
  conversation, ございます is a common and essential part of polite Japanese. Think of it as the polite equivalent
  of ある (for inanimate objects) or いる (for animate objects). However, when referring to people, いらっしゃいます
  (the honorific form of いる) is generally preferred as it conveys a higher level of respect than polite
  speech alone. Therefore, ございます is often used when referring to things or abstract concepts, or sometimes
  even when referring to people in a business context. Interestingly, you'll sometimes see でございます. This
  is considered a separate grammatical structure and is even more formal, often used to politely state
  a fact or one's role.
