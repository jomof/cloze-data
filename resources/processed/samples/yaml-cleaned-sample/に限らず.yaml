writeup: に限らず is a Japanese sentence pattern used to indicate that something is 'not just (A), but (B)
  too', or 'not only (A), but also (B)'. It combines に, the verb 限る (kagiru) meaning "to limit," and the
  archaic negative auxiliary verb ず, which functions similarly to ない. This structure follows nouns. The
  part of the sentence after に限らず introduces things that fall within the same scope or category as the
  initial noun. Sometimes, も is added for extra emphasis, especially when listing multiple items beyond
  (B), such as '(B) も (C) も'.
etymology: The grammar point に限らず is derived from the verb 限る (kagiru), meaning "to limit." The addition
  of に specifies the target to which the limitation does not exclusively apply, and ず negates the limitation,
  thus conveying the meaning of "not only."

post_false_friends_writeup: While all these grammar points express the idea of "not only... but also,"
  there are subtle differences in formality and nuance. に限らず is more formal than だけでなく. のみならず often carries
  a stronger sense of "in addition to." はもちろん emphasizes the obviousness of the first item, while はじめに
  indicates a starting point. Paying attention to these nuances will help you choose the most appropriate
  expression.
