writeup: Just like **これ**, **それ** is considered a pronoun in Japanese (more accurately, it's a substitute
  noun). **それ** roughly translates to "that" and refers to something closer to the listener (physically
  or emotionally) than the speaker. Think of it as pointing to something associated with the listener.
  **それ** is also used to refer back to things that have been mentioned earlier in the conversation, whether
  it was in the same sentence or something someone else said.
examples:
  - japanese: それです。
    english: It's that.

    nuance: The 「です」 makes the sentence polite and formal.
  - japanese: それもエアコンです。
    english: That is also an air conditioner.
    register: formal

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The 「だよ」 at the end makes the sentence casual, often used when speaking to someone close.
  - japanese: それ、可愛いね。
    english: That's cute, isn't it?
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「可愛いね」 is a casual way to say 'cute, isn't it?' and can be used in a flirty context. The lack
      of a topic marker after 「それ」 also contributes to a casual feel.
