writeup: |-
  The grammar point **に違いない** expresses strong certainty or conviction, similar to "there is no doubt that" or "I'm sure." It combines the particle **に** with the noun **違い** (difference) and the negative い-adjective **ない**. Essentially, it conveys the idea that there's no room for doubt or error. You can use **に違いない** with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns in their plain form.

  **Etymology:**
  Breaking down the phrase, **に** marks the preceding element as the state or situation, and **違いない** means "there is no difference" or "it cannot be different." Therefore, the whole expression implies that the stated conclusion aligns perfectly with the given situation, leaving no possibility of an alternative.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *  Be mindful that **違いない** is not the negative form of the verb **違う** (to differ), which is **違わない**. They have different meanings.
  *  This grammar point is used when the speaker has a strong reason or evidence to believe something is true, even if it's not explicitly stated.
