writeup: たて, derived from the verb 立てる (tateru) meaning "to stand", functions as a suffix in Japanese.
  It's attached to the **ます-stem (conjunctive form)** of verbs to indicate that an action has just been
  completed or is freshly done. Essentially, it emphasizes the immediacy and newness of the action. As
  a suffix, たて effectively transforms the verb into a noun, allowing it to be followed by a noun-modifying
  の or a case-marking particle.

  - term: かけ
    meaning: Half-, Not yet finished, About to, Begin to
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「たて」, which means something is freshly completed, 「かけ」 implies that an action is in
      progress or has just begun but is not yet finished.
  - term: たところだ
    meaning: Just finished doing, Was just doing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「たて」 emphasizes the freshness or immediate aftermath of an action, 「たところだ」 focuses more
      on the fact that the action has recently been completed. They are often interchangeable, but 「たて」
      has a stronger nuance of 'newness'.
  - term: たばかり
    meaning: Just did, Something just happened
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「たところだ」, 「たばかり」 indicates that something has just occurred. 「たて」 often carries
      a stronger sense of the positive aspect of something being new or freshly made, especially with
      things that might degrade over time.
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「たて」, 「たところだ」, and 「たばかり」 all indicate that something has recently happened,
  「たて」 specifically highlights the fresh or newly completed state. Be mindful of this nuance, especially
  when describing things like food or newly created items. 「かけ」, on the other hand, represents the opposite
  concept - something that has started but isn't yet finished.
