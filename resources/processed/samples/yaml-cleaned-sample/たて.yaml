  たて, which comes from the verb 立てる meaning "to stand", is a suffix in Japanese that is often used after the **ます-stem (conjunctive form)** of verbs. 「たて」 conveys that something has **just been finished** or is **freshly done**. As a suffix, 「たて」 transforms verbs into nouns. This means it can be followed by a modifying phrase or directly by the case-marking particle の and a noun.

  **Important to note:** 「たて」 emphasizes the immediate aftermath of an action's completion, highlighting the freshness rather than simply stating that something is finished. Consequently, it's most commonly used with verbs where the quality or value of the result is time-sensitive and may diminish after completion.

post_example_writeup: As shown in the examples, 「たて」 is versatile and can be used in various contexts,
  from describing food to personal appearance. It emphasizes the 'just finished' aspect, making it a useful
  way to convey freshness or immediacy.
false_friends:
  - term: かけ
    meaning: Half-, Not yet finished, About to, Begin to
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「たて」 which means 'just finished', 「かけ」 implies something is in the initial stages or
      not yet completed.
  - term: たところだ
    meaning: Just finished doing, Was just doing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to 「たて」, 「たところだ」 focuses more on the action having just been completed, whereas
      「たて」 emphasizes the resulting fresh state.
  - term: たばかり
    meaning: Just did, Something just happened
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「たばかり」 is similar to 「たて」 but is more general and can be used for a wider range of recently
      completed actions, not necessarily emphasizing the 'freshness' aspect as much as 「たて」 does.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「たて」 specifically highlights the freshness
  or immediacy right after something is completed. 「かけ」 is about something starting, while 「たところだ」 and
  「たばかり」 are broader ways to say something was just done, without the same emphasis on the 'fresh' quality.
