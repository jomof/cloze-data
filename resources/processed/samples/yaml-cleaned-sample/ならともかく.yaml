writeup: The grammar point 「ならともかく」 expresses the idea that while one situation (A) might be acceptable,
  another situation (B) is not. It combines 「なら」, indicating a hypothetical condition, with 「ともかく」, meaning
  "anyway," "at any rate," or "to set aside." Essentially, it sets aside the first condition as a possibility
  but focuses on the contrast with the second. It's often translated as "If it's (A), sure, but..." or
  "Putting (A) aside, (B)." This structure highlights a distinction or a reservation about the second
  situation.
