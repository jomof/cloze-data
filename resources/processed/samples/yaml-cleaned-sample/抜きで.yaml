  **抜きで** is formed by combining the noun form of the verb **抜く (ぬく)**, meaning "to extract" or "to remove", with the particle **で**. It generally signifies performing an action "without (A)" or "with the removal of (A)". Since **ぬき** implies extraction, this grammar point is mainly used to indicate leaving out or setting aside something that is usually included.

  **抜きで** functions as a suffix, directly following a noun to indicate what is being omitted. Both the hiragana (ぬきで) and kanji (抜きで) forms are common.

  When **ぬき** is directly followed by another noun, the particle **で** changes to **の**.

  Sometimes, **にして** can replace **で**, particularly when the second part of the sentence (B) involves a negative statement using **ない** or **できない**. This structure emphasizes that something "will not happen without (A)" or "is not possible without (A)".

  However, it's important to note that **抜きで** or **抜きでは** can also appear in negative sentences with the same meaning of "without".

  - term: なし
    meaning: Without, No
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 抜きで, なし is a noun meaning "without" or "non-existence". While both can express the
      absence of something, 抜きで specifically emphasizes the act of removing or excluding something that
      is usually present. なし is a more general term for absence.
post_false_friends_writeup: 'While both 抜きで and なし indicate the absence of something, 抜きで often implies
  a deliberate exclusion or removal. Consider the nuance: saying 「砂糖抜きでコーヒーをください」 (Please give me coffee
  without sugar) suggests a conscious choice to omit sugar. 「砂糖なしのコーヒー」 (Coffee without sugar) is a more
  general description of the coffee''s state.'
