writeup: |-
  **だ** is the plain form of the copula, equivalent to "is" or "to be" in English. It expresses assertion or determination. As a casual form, it's generally used with family, close friends, or when speaking to someone of lower status. Technically, **だ** is an auxiliary verb that attaches to nouns and *na*-adjectives. It's **important to remember that だ cannot be used with *i*-adjectives**. For example, you would say 「大きい**です**」, not 「大きい**だ**」.

  **です** serves the same function as **だ** but is used in polite speech. While often considered the polite form of **だ**, the formally correct version of **だ** is **である**. You'll encounter **である** more often in written materials like articles and formal documents, while **です** is the standard polite form in spoken Japanese.

  on the context and your relationship with the listener. Using 「だ」 in a formal setting can sound abrupt
  or rude, while using 「です」 with close friends can sound overly stiff.

    nuance: While 「だ」 and 「です」 both mean "to be", 「です」 is the polite form, suitable for formal situations

  - term: でございます

  - term: である
    meaning: Formal or literary だ, Authoritative, Copula

  - term: だった・でした
    meaning: Was, Were (Past tense)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「だった」 is the past tense of 「だ」, and 「でした」 is the past tense of 「です」. They indicate a state
      of being in the past.
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember the register and nuance each of these expressions
  carries. 「だ」 is casual and direct, 「です」 is polite and standard, 「でございます」 is highly formal and humble,
  「がある」 indicates existence, 「である」 is formal and written, and 「だった/でした」 indicate past tense. Choosing
  the right form depends on your audience and the context of the conversation.
