  The suffix 「ふう」 (風) meaning 'wind' or 'air', often written in kana, indicates that something is done in the **style, manner, or method** of what precedes it. 「ふうに」 functions similarly to a な-adjective when used adverbially, modifying a verb. It signifies doing something **'in the way of'** or **'like'** the preceding element. It frequently follows pre-noun adjectival words such as 「こんな」 (like this), 「そんな」 (like that), and 「あんな」 (like that over there), emphasizing that an action is performed **'like this'**, **'like that'**, etc.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While the kanji origin of 「ふう」 is 風 (wind), a helpful way to remember its meaning is to think of it as conveying an **'air of'** something. However, remember this is a mnemonic and not a direct semantic equivalent.
  *  「ふうに」 always follows a noun or a noun-like element (including pre-noun adjectivals).

post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 「ように」, 「という風に」, and 「かのようだ」 share some overlap with
  「ふうに」 in conveying similarity or manner, it's important to note their nuances. 「ふうに」 specifically emphasizes
  the **way** something is done or appears, often based on observation. 「ように」 is broader and can indicate
  purpose, resemblance, or a state. 「という風に」 often introduces a more explicit explanation or example of
  the manner. 「かのようだ」 is more figurative, creating a sense of 'as if'. Pay attention to the context to
  choose the most appropriate expression.
