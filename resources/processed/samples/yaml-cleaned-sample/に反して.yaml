  **に反して** (ni hanshite) combines the particle **に** with the **te-form** of the verb **反する** (hansuru), meaning "to oppose" or "to go against." This grammar point is used to introduce a statement that contradicts or goes against a previous statement, expectation, rule, or common sense. It conveys a sense of opposition or contrast. Common English translations include "contrary to (A), (B)" and "going against (A), (B)."

  **に反して** typically follows a noun, indicating what the subsequent statement opposes. The plain form **に反する** can be used to directly modify a noun (e.g., 規則に反する行為 - an act that violates the rules).

  A key distinction from **に対して** (ni taishite) is that **に反して** often emphasizes a mismatch between a prediction or expectation and the actual outcome.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  **Formality:** **に反して** is a relatively formal expression, more commonly found in written materials, official documents, and formal speeches.
  *  **Contrast:** It strongly highlights the contrast or opposition between two things.
  *  **Expectation vs. Reality:** It's often used when reality deviates from expectations.
