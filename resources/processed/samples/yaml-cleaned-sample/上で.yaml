  **上で (うえで)** is a Japanese grammar point used to indicate that something (B) happens after or upon a preceding action or condition (A). It conveys a sense of logical progression or prerequisite. Think of it as saying "after doing A, then B" or "upon A being the case, then B."

  Key points about 上で:

  *  **連接 (Connection):** It connects to the **past tense form of verbs** (た形) or **nouns followed by の**.
  *  **Formality:** This expression is considered **formal** and is typically found in written language or formal speech. You won't hear it as often in casual conversation.
  *  **Logical Sequence:** 上で strongly suggests that action A is a necessary step or a logical precursor to action B. It implies a cause-and-effect relationship or a planned sequence.
  *  **Constraint on A:** **Crucially, the verb in the A clause cannot be in the passive voice.** This is because passive voice often implies a lack of agency or control, which doesn't fit the sense of a deliberate action preceding another.

  **Etymology:**

  The literal meaning of 上で can help understand its usage. 上 (うえ) means "above" or "previous," and で is the particle indicating the means or method. So, literally, it's like saying "with the above/previous action," implying that the second action follows from the first.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *  While it translates to "after" or "upon," it has a more formal and structured feel than simply using 「てから」 or 「あとで」.
  *  It emphasizes the logical connection between the two actions.
  *  Be mindful of the restriction on passive verbs in the first clause.

  important to recognize the subtle differences. 上で carries a more formal tone and suggests a deliberate
  sequence where the first action is a necessary step or logical prerequisite for the second. 「てから」 and
  「あとで」 are more general ways to express "after." 「上に」 means "in addition to." 「たら」 expresses various
  conditional or temporal meanings. 「た末・の末」 indicates a conclusion after a period of time. 「て初めて」 emphasizes
  something happening only after a specific action.
