  function: Describes a state or property of a subject or topic.
  grammatical-role: predicate
etymology: The い in い-adjective originates from the inflectional ending that characterizes this type of
  adjective. The term 'predicate' comes from the grammatical role the adjective plays in the sentence,
  describing the subject. This is a fundamental concept in Japanese grammar, signifying that the adjective
  is completing the sentence by describing the subject's state or quality.
writeup: |-
  A predicate is a word that describes the topic or subject of a sentence. In Japanese, this is called a 述語 (じゅつご), which literally means 'statement word.' As predicates, い-adjectives can appear by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used at the end of a sentence. When an い-adjective stands alone, it implies 'It is [adjective],' and the 'it' is understood from context. All い-adjectives are words of Japanese origin.

  In many sentences, either は or が can mark the word(s) the predicate describes. However, the choice depends on context. Generally, が is used to specifically point out something as being different from other items in the same category. For instance, when emphasizing a specific attribute, such as the unusual hotness of a bath, が would be used, whereas は would be less natural if that level of hotness is not its typical state. This grammatical nuance allows for precise expression regarding the subject's characteristics.
false_friends:
  - term: な-形容詞 + だ or です
    meaning: Na-adjective used as predicate (e.g., 静かだ/静かです)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike い-adjectives which directly conjugate to end a sentence, な-adjectives require だ or
      です (or their conjugated forms) to serve as a predicate. For example, 「静か です」 vs 「美味しい です」.
    grammar_point: な-Adjective (predicate form)
  - term: 欲しい
    meaning: to want (an object/thing)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While grammatically similar to an い-adjective, 欲しい specifically expresses a desire for a tangible
      object or an abstract concept that can be desired (e.g., 自由が欲しい - 'I want freedom'). It does not
      describe an inherent property of a noun like other い-adjectives do.
    grammar_point: ほしい (want something)
  - term: ～がる
    meaning: (someone) shows signs of wanting/feeling/being; (someone) appears to be
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Used to describe *someone else's* apparent desire or feeling (e.g., 怖がる - 'to show signs of
      being scared'), unlike い-adjectives which directly state a property or feeling of the subject. It
      cannot be used for the speaker's own direct feelings.
    grammar_point: がる (to show signs)
post_false_friends_writeup: While い-adjectives and な-adjectives both function as predicates, it is crucial
  to remember their structural differences. い-adjectives can stand alone at the end of a sentence in their
  plain form, while な-adjectives always require a copula like だ or です. This distinction is fundamental
  for correct sentence construction and politeness levels. Additionally, be careful not to confuse い-adjectives,
  which describe inherent qualities, with expressions like 欲しい (to want a thing) or ～がる (to show signs
  of feeling), which convey desire or externally observed states rather than direct properties.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は {暑い} ね。
        english: It's hot today, isn't it?
        hint: The 'です' makes the statement polite and suitable for general conversation, avoiding the
          casualness of plain form which might be too informal for this setting. We're looking for the
          polite form ending in です。
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は {暑い}。
        english: It's hot today.
        hint: The addition of 'です ね' softens the statement, inviting agreement and making it more engaging
          for small talk, rather than a mere factual declaration. We're looking for the polite form ending
          in です。
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 暑 そう です ね。
        english: It seems hot today, doesn't it?
        hint: 「そう です」 indicates that something seems or appears to be a certain way, or that you heard
          it from someone else. We're looking for a direct statement about the current weather using an
          い-adjective. For example, the sentence is about the weather, not about what you heard about
          the weather, so 'そう' isn't correct here. We're looking for the polite form ending in です。
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 暖かい です ね。
        english: It's warm today, isn't it?
        hint: 「暖かい」 means 'warm', suggesting a pleasant temperature, whereas '暑い' means 'hot', usually
          referring to an uncomfortable heat. We're looking for 'hot' in the polite form ending in です。

        english: It's lively today, isn't it?
        hint: 「賑やか」 is a な-adjective which conjugates differently from い-adjectives like 「暑い」. We're looking
          for 'hot' as an い-adjective in the polite form ending in です。

          can omit です to make the question more casual among friends. '
    scene: A student asks a friend about the price of a laptop they are considering buying, hoping it's

    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The plain negative question 「高くない？」 is a common and natural way for younger male friends to
      confirm an assumption about something, in this case, the affordability of a laptop. The rising intonation
      makes it a question.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the predicate forms of い-adjectives, especially their plain and polite
  conjugations, is crucial for natural communication in Japanese. Pay attention to the context and desired
  politeness level when choosing between forms like です or the plain form. The choice often conveys subtle
  social cues about your relationship with the listener and the formality of the situation.
