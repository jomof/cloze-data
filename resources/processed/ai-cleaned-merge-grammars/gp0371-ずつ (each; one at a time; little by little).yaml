id: gp0371
meaning: Each; per; one at a time; little by little; gradually
pronunciation:
  katakana: ズツ
  romaji: zutsu
formation:
  Noun + ずつ: Indicates equal distribution, repetition, or gradual progression of the noun.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  usage-context: Used to describe quantity, frequency, or a gradual process. Can be applied to both discrete
    items and continuous actions.
  function: Indicates a uniform distribution or incremental progress.
  nuance: Emphasizes the "at a time" or "per" aspect, highlighting that the action or state occurs in
    consistent, often equal, increments.
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially, modifying verbs or verb phrases
etymology: The word 「ずつ」 originally comes from the verb 「続く (つづく)」 (tsuzuku), meaning "to continue." This
  etymology reflects the grammar point's nuance of something happening repeatedly or gradually.
writeup: The particle 「ずつ」 is employed after a noun, typically a quantifier, to denote phenomena that
  occur or exist in specific amounts, intervals, or increments. Its function is analogous to English expressions
  such as "each," "per," or "at a time." While some linguistic analyses classify 「ずつ」 as an adverbial
  particle, its application remains consistent regardless of categorization. The kanji form 「宛」, which
  literally translates to "allotment," further illuminates the concept of distinct, uniform groupings.
  It is important to distinguish this use of 「宛」 from its more common reading of 「あて」 when referring to
  an address or destination.

  - term: ばかり
    meaning: only, just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ずつ」 emphasizes equal distribution, incremental progression, or performing an action little
      by little. In contrast, 「ばかり」 focuses on exclusivity, meaning 'only' or 'just', often implying a
      limitation or a recent completion of an action. For example, 「食べたばかり」 means 'just ate', focusing
      on time, while 「一つずつ」 focuses on distribution.
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・just, often with nuance of excess)
  - term: ごとに
    meaning: each, every, for each
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express 'each' or 'every', 「ごとに」 emphasizes repetition at regular intervals or
      for every specific item (e.g., 「毎週ごとに」 for 'every week'). It often highlights a pattern or a recurring
      event. 「ずつ」, on the other hand, specifically implies distribution of discrete quantities (e.g.,
      「一人ずつ」 for 'one person at a time') or gradual, continuous increments ('little by little'), focusing
      on an even distribution or steady pace rather than just recurrence.
    grammar_point: ごとに (each・every)
  - term: だんだん
    meaning: gradually
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both describe a gradual process, but 「だんだん」 implies a more noticeable, often progressive change
      or increase/decrease over time. It suggests a continuous, observable progression. 「ずつ」, especially
      when paired with quantifiers like 「少し」 (e.g., 「少しずつ」), emphasizes smaller, more discrete, sometimes
      imperceptible, increments or a gentler pace. It highlights the step-by-step nature of change rather
      than just its overall progression.
    grammar_point: だんだん (gradually)
  - term: 各
    meaning: each, every
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「各」 (かく) is a formal term typically used as a prefix or adjectival noun meaning 'each' or
      'every' to refer to individual members within a group (e.g., 「各人」 for 'each person', 「各国」 for 'each
      country'). It signifies individuality or comprehensiveness among distinct entities. 「ずつ」, while
      also meaning 'each', specifically implies distribution in equal or consistent portions, or performing
      an action 'one by one' (e.g., 「一つずつ」 for 'one by one' or 「二人ずつ」 for 'two at a time'), focusing on
      the method of apportionment.
    grammar_point: 各 (each or every)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「ずつ」 indicates increments, equal distribution, or something that progresses
  little by little. 「ばかり」 is more about limiting something to a specific case or condition. 「ごとに」 focuses
  on recurring instances. 「だんだん」 describes a general, often more noticeable, gradual change. 「各」 (かく)
  emphasizes the individuality of members within a group.

          - メニュー に 載っ て いる もの を {各々} ください。
        english: Please give me each item individually.
        hint: 「各々」 means 'each one' or 'individually' and can be used when referring to separate items,
          but it doesn't specify 'one of each kind'. We're looking for a way to say 'one unit of each
          item' for distribution.

          a sequence of 'one unit at a time' in a group or process. We're looking for a smooth, continuous
          flow of single entries.

        english: Every month, I save a little money bit by bit to go on a trip.
        hint: While 「少しずつ」 means 'little by little' in general, 「いくら か ずつ」 implies 'some amount each time,'
          allowing for slight variations in the amount saved. We're looking for the nuance of saving 'some
          varying amount' each month.

        hint: 「ごとに」 means 'every (unit of time/group)' or 'for each,' often indicating a repeating interval.
          「ずつ」 specifically refers to 'one unit at a time' or 'in increments of one,' focusing on the
          step-by-step movement of individual groups. We're looking for the idea of groups moving sequentially,
          one by one.

        hint: 「各々」 means 'each one' or 'individually' and implies that each person should bring something,

          per year. We're looking for the specific idea of an incremental, consistent rise.

        hint: 「徐々に」 means 'gradually' or 'step by step,' implying a smooth, continuous change. 「少しずつ」
          emphasizes very small, discrete increments. We're looking for a gentle, deliberate progression
          in small steps.
      - competing_japanese:

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「ずつ」 emphasizes discrete, equal increments or distribution,
  whether it's for physical items, gradual processes, or forming groups. Pay close attention to how it
  conveys a consistent pace or allotment, making it distinct from other words that might imply general
  gradualness or individuality without the precise incremental nature.
