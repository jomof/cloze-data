writeup: |-
  「次第」 (shidai) is a grammatical expression used to indicate that an action or event will happen immediately upon the completion of a preceding action. It is typically used in formal or polite contexts, such as business communications, announcements, or when making a firm commitment.

  This construction uses the **ます-stem of a verb** (e.g., 終わります → 終わり次第) followed by 「次第」. The meaning conveyed is "as soon as" or "upon completion of." It emphasizes that the second action will commence without delay, or very soon after the first action is fully completed.

  **Key Characteristics:**
  *   **Immediacy:** The core meaning stresses that the action following 「次第」 will happen right away.
  *   **Certainty/Commitment:** It often implies a strong commitment or certainty that the subsequent action will occur.
  *   **Formality:** While you might hear it in casual speech, it lends a more formal or polite tone to the sentence, making it suitable for professional or public announcements.
  *   **Future-oriented:** It almost exclusively refers to actions or events in the future.

  - term: 直ちに
    meaning: At once, immediately, as soon as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「直ちに」 emphasizes the speed of the action, focusing on how quickly something is done, whereas
      「次第」 highlights the sequence of events and the promptness of the action *upon completion*.

  - term: たとたんに
    meaning: The instant or moment, As soon as, Just as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～た とたん に」 emphasizes the suddenness and unexpected nature of the second action immediately
      following the first, often with a sense of surprise or discovery. 「次第」 denotes an immediate, expected
      sequence, often in more formal contexts.

  - term: や否や
    meaning: As soon as; no sooner than; the minute
    kind: similar expression

  - term: N + 次第だ・次第で
    meaning: Depending on
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While sharing the word 「次第」, this form indicates dependency on a noun as a determining factor,
      without the temporal 'as soon as' meaning. It's crucial not to confuse the two distinct functions.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Noun]次第だ・[Noun]次第で (depending on)
  - term: 次第です
    meaning: This is why; The circumstances are such that; Therefore (a situation arises)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: As a sentence ending, 「～次第です」 primarily serves to explain the *reason* or *circumstances*
      leading to a particular situation. It does not carry the 'as soon as' temporal meaning, but rather
      provides an explanation of how things came to be.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Noun]次第だ・[Noun]次第で (depending on)
post_false_friends_writeup: To ensure correct usage, differentiate between 「～次第」 as "as soon as" (V-stem
  + 次第) and other expressions. While terms like 「なり」, 「直ちに」, 「～た とたん に」, and 「や否や」 also convey immediacy,
  they each carry slightly different nuances regarding the suddenness or unexpectedness of the follow-up
  action. Importantly, do not confuse this temporal usage with the Noun + 次第 meaning "depending on" or
  the explanatory sentence-ending 「次第です」. Context and the part of speech preceding 「次第」 are key.
