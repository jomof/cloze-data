    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ないではいられない」 expresses the idea that one cannot help but do something, or cannot resist doing something. It indicates a strong, often uncontrollable urge or feeling. The structure is formed by attaching 「ではいられない」 to the negative form of a verb (ない-form). It emphasizes that the speaker is compelled to act in a certain way, whether due to emotions, circumstances, or a strong desire. It is often used to convey feelings of inevitability or compulsion.",
