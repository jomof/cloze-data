    "writeup": "The grammar point **ないではいられない** expresses an uncontrollable urge or feeling to do something, meaning one \"cannot help but do\" or \"cannot resist doing\" something. It is formed by attaching **ではいられない** to the negative form (ない-form) of a verb. This structure highlights that the speaker is compelled to act in a certain way due to strong emotions, circumstances, or an inherent desire.\n\nIt can convey several nuances:\n*   **Inability to tolerate inaction**: The speaker simply cannot remain in a state of not doing something, implying a strong desire to act.\n*   **Unfortunate compulsion**: An action is taken despite the speaker knowing they perhaps shouldn't, due to an overwhelming urge.\n*   **Irrepressible emotion/reaction**: In a given situation, a particular emotion, feeling, or physical reaction cannot be suppressed, occurring naturally as a consequence of the circumstances.\n\nThis expression emphasizes the inevitability or compulsion driving the action or feeling.",

In contrast, **てはいられない** carries a different nuance altogether; it indicates that one cannot continue doing something, often due to time constraints or other external limitations, focusing on the practical impossibility rather than an internal compulsion.",
