    "etymology": "The grammar point ないではいられない is composed of: \n*   ない (nai): The negative form of a verb.\n*   で (de): A particle indicating reason or cause.\n*   は (wa): A topic marker particle.\n*   いられない (irarenai): The potential negative form of いる (iru, \"to be\"), indicating impossibility or inability. The literal translation is \"cannot exist without doing (something)\", thus implying an irresistible urge.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「ないではいられない」 expresses that something cannot be helped or resisted. It combines the negative form of a verb with 「で」, 「は」, and the negative potential form of 「いる」 (to be), essentially meaning \"to be unable to be without doing (A).\" \n\nPrimarily, it indicates the speaker's inability to tolerate (A) *not* happening due to a strong desire to do it. It can also imply doing something against one's better judgment. Additionally, 「ないではいられない」 highlights that a particular emotion, feeling, or reaction arises naturally as a consequence of (A). (B) happens naturally as a consequence of (A).",
