    "etymology": "The verb 「終わる (おわる)」 means \"to end\" or \"to finish.\" As a grammar point, it's used as an auxiliary verb attached to the ます-stem of another verb to indicate the completion of that action. The concept comes directly from the verb's inherent meaning of bringing something to a close.",
    "writeup": "To express that actions are ending in Japanese, the verb 「終わる (おわる)」 is used. To say that (A) is ending/finishing, attach 「おわる」 to the ます-stem of almost any verb.\n\nWhether you use the hiragana form or the kanji form does not matter, as there will be no change in nuance.\n\nBecause 「おわる」 is a verb itself, the tense can be changed to show that something will end, is ending, or has ended.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Unlike 「はじめる」, which uses the transitive form, 「おわる」 uses the intransitive form of its transitive/intransitive pair. This is due to most actions in Japanese being considered to be things that \"come to an end\" naturally (intransitive), rather than forcefully (transitive). However, there are exceptions to this, and 「終える」 (the transitive version) may also be seen used as an auxiliary to other verbs.",
