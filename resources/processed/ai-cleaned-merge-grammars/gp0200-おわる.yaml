    "etymology": "The auxiliary verb 「おわる」 comes from the intransitive verb 「終わる」 (owaru), which means \"to end; to come to a close\". It describes the state of an action coming to an end.",
    "writeup": "To express that actions are beginning or ending in Japanese, the verbs 始める (hajimeru, to commence) or 終わる (owaru, to end) are used. This lesson focuses on actions that are 'ending'. To say that (A) is ending/finishing, attach 終わる to the ます-stem of almost any verb. Whether you use the hiragana form or the kanji form does not change the nuance.\n\nSince 終わる is itself a verb, its tense can be changed to show that something will end, is ending, or has ended.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nUnlike 始める, which uses the transitive form, 終わる usually uses the intransitive form of its transitive/intransitive pair. This is because most actions in Japanese are considered to be things that 'come to an end' naturally (intransitive) rather than forcefully (transitive). However, there are exceptions to this, and 終える (oeru, the transitive version) may also be seen used as an auxiliary to other verbs.",
