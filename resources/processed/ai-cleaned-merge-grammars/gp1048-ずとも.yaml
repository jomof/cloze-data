    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずとも」 is derived from the classical negative auxiliary verb 「ず」 (a literary equivalent of 「ない」) and the conjunctive particle 「とも」, meaning 「even if」. Thus, it literally means 「even if not」.",
    "writeup": "The construction 「ずとも」 combines the classical auxiliary verb 「ず」 (used for negation) with the conjunction particle 「とも」 meaning \"even if.\" It implies that regardless of whether (A) occurs or not, (B) still applies. This often translates to \"even if not (A), (B)\" or \"don't have to (A) to (B).\" 「ずとも」 attaches to the *nai*-stem (未然形) of verbs. When expressing \"not being (A)\" rather than \"not doing (A),\" 「ならずとも」 follows a noun; this comes from the negated form of the verb 「なる」 (\"to become\"). Although 「ずとも」 is a formal expression, it can occasionally be used sarcastically. It's also often followed by 「良い」, meaning \"okay even if not (A).\"",
