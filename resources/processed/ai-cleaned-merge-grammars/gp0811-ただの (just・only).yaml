meaning: Just; only; merely; common; ordinary; plain

  romaji: tada no
formation:
  ただの + Noun: Indicates that something is merely a common or ordinary example of the noun, emphasizing
    its lack of distinction or special quality.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The term 「ただ」 (tada) originally meant 'free' or 'gratis' (e.g., in 「無料」, muryō, or 「ただ飯」, tadameshi,
  a free meal). Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass 'ordinary' or 'common', signifying something
  that is not special or costly. The addition of the particle 「の」 (no) functions as a genitive particle,
  making 「ただの」 a direct modifier for nouns, similar to 'of ordinary' or 'a mere' in English, reinforcing
  the idea of plainness or lack of extraordinary qualities.
writeup: 「ただの」 is a grammatical construct used to emphasize that something is nothing special, merely
  ordinary, or "just" something. It functions as a pre-noun modifier, directly preceding the noun it describes.
  This expression is particularly useful when you want to downplay the significance of something or clarify
  that it lacks any extraordinary or hidden qualities. It's akin to saying "just a" or "only a" in English,
  often conveying a sense of disappointment, reassurance, or dismissiveness. It is frequently used in
  everyday speech and informal contexts, but can appear in more formal settings when the speaker wishes
  to explicitly state the plainness or lack of distinction of a subject. The nuance of 「ただの」 is stronger
  than simply stating a fact; it deliberately highlights the 'unremarkable' aspect.

  - term: 単なる
    meaning: Simple, mere, plain.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both convey a sense of simplicity or ordinariness, 「単なる」 (tan naru) is generally considered
      a more formal and slightly stronger synonym, often used in written contexts or to emphasize a definitive
      lack of complexity or depth. It often sounds more objective.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:単なる (mere, simple)
  - term: 普通の
    meaning: Normal, ordinary, usual.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「普通の」 (futsū no) simply describes something as ordinary in a general, neutral sense without
      the added nuance of dismissing or downplaying. 「ただの」 implies that something is merely ordinary and
      nothing more, often conveying a subjective judgment of insignificance.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:普通の (ordinary, common)
  - term: に過ぎない
    meaning: nothing more than; merely; just; only
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に過ぎない」 (ni suginai) is a more emphatic and often critical expression, stating that something
      is nothing more than a certain thing, implying it's insufficient, trivial, or fails to meet expectations.
      It's a sentence-ending expression rather than a noun modifier like 「ただの」.
    grammar_point: にすぎない (no more than)
  - term: 単に
    meaning: Simply, merely, only.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「単に」 (tanni) is an adverb that modifies verbs or clauses, meaning "simply" or "merely." While
      「ただの」 is a pre-noun modifier that emphasizes the ordinariness of a noun, 「単に」 describes the simple
      manner or reason of an action or state. It doesn't modify nouns directly.
    grammar_point: 単に (simply)
  - term: ばかり
    meaning: Only, nothing but.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ばかり」 can mean "only" or "nothing but," similar to 「ただの」 in implying exclusivity or lack of
      anything else. However, 「ばかり」 can be used more broadly with verbs and quantities (e.g., 「食べることばかり考えている」
      - "He thinks only about eating"), whereas 「ただの」 is strictly a pre-noun modifier to emphasize lack
      of specialness.
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・just, often with nuance of excess)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「ただの」 is a casual, pre-noun modifier emphasizing something is merely ordinary
  or just what it seems, often with a dismissive or humble tone. It differs from the more objective and
  formal noun modifier 「単なる」, and the neutral descriptor 「普通の」. Unlike the adverbial 「単に」 (simply) or
  the sentence-ending, emphatic 「に過ぎない」 (nothing more than), 「ただの」 specifically modifies nouns to convey
  this subjective ordinariness. While 「ばかり」 also means 'only' or 'nothing but', it has a broader range
  of use beyond describing a noun's lack of specialness.

      reassures them that it's not severe.

    register: formal
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The term 「主婦」(shufu) itself denotes a married woman who primarily manages her household. When
      used with 「ただの」, it emphasizes a humble or self-deprecating tone, common among Japanese women who
      might minimize their contributions despite often managing complex household finances and family
      logistics. This is a common way for Japanese women to express modesty.

      towards subordinates or younger people, regardless of gender, indicating familiarity and a slight
      hierarchical distance. The 「よ」 (yo) at the end adds a sense of assertion and reassurance. This phrase
      is a common way for an older person to encourage a younger one.

          emphasizing it was only a joke and should not be taken seriously.
    scene: Someone took a comment too seriously, and the speaker wants to lighten the mood and clarify
      their intent.

post_example_writeup: The usage of 「ただの」 often carries an underlying emotional tone, whether it's relief,
  humility, dismissal, or reassurance. It's more than a simple descriptor; it's a way to contextualize
  the ordinariness of something in relation to a perceived significance or expectation. Paying attention
  to the context and the speaker's intent is crucial for understanding its full implication.
