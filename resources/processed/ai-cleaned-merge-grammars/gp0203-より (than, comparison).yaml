    "etymology": "The particle 「より」 originates from the verb 「寄る (よる)」, meaning \"to approach\" or \"to gather.\" Over time, its meaning evolved to indicate a point of origin or a point of comparison, eventually leading to its modern usage of \"than\" when making comparisons.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「より」 is used to indicate a standard of comparison. It functions to specify the item or action that something else is 'more' or 'less' than. When used in a comparison, the element immediately preceding 「より」 is the standard being surpassed or exceeded. Therefore, the item connected to 「より」 is implicitly understood to be 'less' in the characteristic being discussed, compared to the other element in the sentence.\n\nWhile 「より」 can stand alone, it is frequently seen in the structure 「A より B の方が Adjective です」, explicitly stating that 'B is more (adjective) than A'. However, in casual conversation, 「より」 can sometimes appear without a directly stated comparison object, implying a comparison against 'other things' or general expectations.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that 「より」 marks the *point of comparison* that is being surpassed. For instance, in \"A より B が 好き\" (I like B more than A), 'A' is the reference point that is 'less preferred' than 'B'.",

If you're stating that something is not as X as Y, use 「ほど〜ない」. If you're explicitly comparing two specific items (A and B), 「〜のほうが」 is a common and clear choice. For rephrasing or correcting a statement, 「というより」 is appropriate. When discussing something exceeding a standard or quantity, use 「以上に」 or 「以上」. If you need to emphasize a point or specific item, 「こそ」 serves that purpose. 「最も」 and 「一番」 express the absolute highest degree, not a relative comparison.
