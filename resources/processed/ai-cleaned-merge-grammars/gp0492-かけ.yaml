    "etymology": "The grammar point 「かけ」 comes from the verb 「掛ける」 (kakeru), which means \"to hang,\" \"to suspend,\" or \"to start doing something.\" The nuance is that something is \"suspended\" in the process of happening, or is partially completed.",
    "writeup": "「かけ」 functions as a suffix indicating that an action or state is unfinished, about to start, or on the verge of occurring. It is derived from the verb 「掛ける」 (kakeru), meaning \"to hang\" or \"to suspend.\" This nuance is key: think of it as something 'suspended' in the middle of a process, like a photo capturing a moment between start and finish. It attaches to the stem (連用形, ren'yōkei) of verbs. While 「かけ」 primarily functions like a noun and can be followed by the particle 「の」 when modifying another noun, or 「だ」 at the end of a sentence, the verb 「掛ける」 itself may occasionally be used to convey a similar meaning. The interpretation of 「かけ」 depends on the verb it is paired with:\n\n*   With verbs denoting momentary actions (which cannot be 'half' done), 「かけ」 conveys that the action was 'on the verge of' happening. For example, 「死にかけ」 (shini-kake) means \"on the verge of dying.\"\n*   With verbs describing ongoing actions, 「かけ」 implies that the action is 'in the process' of being done, or 'half-done.' For example, 「食べかけ」 (tabe-kake) means \"half-eaten.\"",
