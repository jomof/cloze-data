    "etymology": "The grammar point 「かけ」 comes from the verb 「掛(か)ける」 (kakeru), which means \"to hang,\" \"to suspend,\" or \"to start something.\" The idea is that the action is 'suspended' mid-process, not yet completed. It functions as a noun when used with 「の」.",
    "writeup": "「かけ」 is derived from the verb 「掛(か)ける」 (kakeru) \"to hang; to suspend; to start something\". It attaches to the stem of a verb or follows a noun with 「の」 to indicate something is unfinished, in the process of being done, or about to begin. Think of something being \"stuck\" midway through. It generally translates to \"half-\", \"about to\", or \"not yet finished\". Because 「かけ」 behaves like a noun, it can be followed by the case-marking particle 「の」 when attached to another noun or by 「だ」 at the end of a sentence.",
