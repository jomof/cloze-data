grammar_point: '[Verb-よう]思う (intend to)'
learn_before:
  - 〜と思っている (I think・I believe)
  - やめる (to stop)
  - 思うに (in my opinion)
id: gp0160
meaning: to intend to do; to be thinking of doing
pronunciation:
  katakana: ヨウ オモウ
  romaji: yō omou
formation:
  Verb[volitional form] + と + 思う: Expresses the speaker's intention or decision to do something.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The construction combines the volitional form of a verb (〜よう), which inherently expresses an
  inclination or suggestion ("let's do X", "shall I do X"), with the verb 思う (omou), meaning "to think"
  or "to consider". Literally, it translates to "to think 'I shall do X'" or "to think 'let's do X'".
  This grammatical combination naturally evolved to express the speaker's intention or resolution to perform
  an action, as thinking about doing something in the volitional sense implies an internal decision or
  plan. The と particle functions as a quotative marker, indicating that the volitional thought is the
  content of what is being thought.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point [Verb-よう]と思う is used to express your intention or what you are thinking of doing. It literally means "to think 'I shall (do something)'" or "to think 'let's (do something)'". This structure clearly indicates a decision or plan that originates from the speaker's own thoughts.

  This expression is commonly used for personal plans or decisions that you have made. It can range from immediate, spontaneous decisions to more long-term intentions. The nuance is that the intention is a result of your own thought process.

  It is important to note that while 思う itself can be conjugated into various politeness levels (e.g., 思います, 思っています), the core meaning of expressing intention remains. The politeness of the entire sentence will depend on the conjugation of 思う.

  - term: Verb[volitional]
    meaning: Let's go; I shall go (suggestion, immediate decision)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The plain volitional form often expresses a suggestion to others or a very immediate, often
      spontaneous, personal decision. It lacks the "thinking" aspect of 〜と思う, making it sound more direct
      or declarative. We're looking for an internal intention that is being considered or decided upon.
    grammar_point: Verb[よう] (volitional)
  - term: ~つもりだ
    meaning: To intend to do; to plan to; to be convinced that (firm intention, assumption)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜つもりだ expresses a firmer, more definite intention or plan, or even a conviction about something.
      It implies that the decision has been made and is less likely to change. 〜と思う suggests a thought
      process leading to the intention, which might imply a slightly softer or less fixed plan. We're
      looking for a slightly less definite intention or one still in the realm of thinking.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]つもりだ (to intend to)'
  - term: ~たい
    meaning: Want to do; desire to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜たい expresses a desire or wish, a feeling of wanting to do something. While desire often precedes
      intention, 〜たい does not necessarily mean a decision or plan has been made. 〜と思う indicates that a
      decision or plan has formed from that desire. We're looking for an actual intention or decision,
      not just a desire.
    grammar_point: たい (want to do)
  - term: ~ことにする
    meaning: To decide to do (formal decision, often implies a habit or a new rule)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜ことにする signifies a formal decision that has been made, often implying a new rule, habit, or
      a settled course of action. It's stronger and more definitive than 〜と思う and often suggests an external
      factor or previous consideration led to the decision. We're looking for a more personal and potentially
      less rigid intention.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ことにする (to decide to do)'
  - term: ~とする
    meaning: To try to do; to decide to do; to assume
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜とする can express an attempt to do something or a decision made at that very moment, often
      in a more formal or decisive context. It can also mean "to assume." 〜と思う is about thinking about
      the intention, whereas 〜とする is about the act of deciding or attempting. We're looking for an intention
      that is still somewhat in the mental realm.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-volitional]とする・としない (to try to・to not try to)'
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between these expressions, consider the degree of decisiveness
  and the nature of the action. [Verb-よう]と思う is about your personal thought process leading to an intention.
  Verb[volitional] is a more direct statement of intent or a suggestion. 〜つもりだ implies a firmer, more
  established plan. 〜たい expresses a desire without necessarily a decision. 〜ことにする denotes a more formal
  or settled decision, often implying a change in habit. Lastly, 〜とする can mean an immediate attempt or
  decision, sometimes with an element of trying.

    scene: Someone recalling a moment of strong resolve against an undesirable situation.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The use of 「させまい」 (the negative volitional of させる) combined with 「と思った」 expresses a very strong
      determination or resolve *not* to allow something to happen in the past. This is a powerful, though
      less common, use of the structure for negative intention. It conveys a deep-seated mental opposition.
    etymology: The negative volitional 「まい」 is a more classical and emphatic way to express "will not"
      or "do not intend to." Its combination with 「思う」 creates a strong, decisive statement of negative
      intent, often used in literature or for particularly weighty decisions.
