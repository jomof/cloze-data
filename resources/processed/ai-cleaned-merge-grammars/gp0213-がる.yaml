    "details": {
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "general"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「がる」 originates from the verb 「気(き)がある (ki ga aru)」, meaning \"to have a feeling\" or \"to show interest\". Over time, it evolved into a suffix to express that someone other than the speaker exhibits certain feelings or desires.",
    "writeup": "「がる」 is a verb suffix, added to adjectives or the 「たい」 form of verbs, to describe how someone *appears* to feel or what they *seem* to want. Because you cannot directly know someone else's feelings, 「がる」 allows you to express your perception of their feelings or desires.\n\n*   With **い-adjectives**, drop the 「い」 and add 「がる」. For example, 「寒(さむ)い (samui)」 (cold) becomes 「寒(さむ)がる (samugaru)」 (to appear cold).\n*   With **な-adjectives**, the 「な」 is not included. For example, 「嫌(いや)な (iya na)」 (disagreeable) becomes 「嫌(いや)がる (iyagaru)」 (to dislike).\n*   With **verbs**, it's typically attached to the 「たい」 form. 「食(た)べる (taberu)」 (to eat) becomes 「食(た)べたい (tabetai)」 (want to eat), then 「食(た)べたがる (tabetagaru)」 (to want to eat (appears to)).\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「がる」 is generally used for people other than yourself. If you want to talk about your own feelings, use the adjective directly or use 「思(おも)う (omou)」 (to think).\n*   The construction 「～たがっている」 describes someone's current state, while 「～たがる」 can describe a habitual tendency.\n*   Using 「～そうだ」 (it seems) is a similar expression, but 「がる」 emphasizes the *behavior* that leads you to believe they feel that way.",
