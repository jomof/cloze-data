    "etymology": "The grammar point 「がる」 originates from the verb 「気(き)がある (ki ga aru)」, meaning \"to have a feeling\" or \"to show interest\". Over time, it evolved into a suffix to express that someone other than the speaker exhibits certain feelings or desires. Its function is to externalize an internal state, making it observable behavior.",
    "writeup": "「がる」 is a versatile verb suffix, added to adjectives or the 「たい」 form of verbs, to describe how someone *appears* to feel or what they *seem* to want. Since one cannot directly know another person's internal feelings, 「がる」 allows you to express your perception of their feelings or desires based on their observable behavior.\n\n*   When attached to **い-adjectives**, drop the final 「い」 and add 「がる」. For example, 「寒(さむ)い (samui)」 (cold) becomes 「寒(さむ)がる (samugaru)」 (to appear cold, to show signs of being cold).\n*   With **な-adjectives**, simply remove the 「な」 and add 「がる」. For example, 「嫌(いや)な (iya na)」 (disagreeable) becomes 「嫌(いや)がる (iyagaru)」 (to dislike, to show aversion).\n*   For **verbs**, it is typically attached to the 「たい」 form, which expresses desire. So, 「食(た)べる (taberu)」 (to eat) first becomes 「食(た)べたい (tabetai)」 (want to eat), and then 「食(た)べたがる (tabetagaru)」 (to want to eat, to appear to want to eat).\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「がる」 is generally used for people other than yourself (third person). If you want to talk about your own feelings, you typically use the adjective directly (e.g., 「寒い」 for \"I'm cold\") or the 「たい」 form (e.g., 「食べたい」 for \"I want to eat\"). Using 「がる」 for oneself is grammatically possible but often sounds unnatural, unless you are describing your own outward behavior as if observing yourself from an external perspective, or emphasizing an intense, almost uncontrollable desire.\n*   The continuous form 「～たがっている」 describes someone's current state or ongoing display of feelings/desires, while the dictionary form 「～たがる」 can describe a habitual tendency or general inclination.\n*   While 「～そうだ」 (it seems) is a similar expression indicating appearance, 「がる」 specifically emphasizes the *behavior* or *action* that leads you to believe they feel that way, focusing on the external manifestation of an internal state. 「～そうだ」, on the other hand, often implies a direct visual observation of a state or an imminent action.",
