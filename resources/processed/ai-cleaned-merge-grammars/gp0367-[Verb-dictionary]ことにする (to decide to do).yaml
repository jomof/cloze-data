pronunciation:
  katakana: コトニスル
  romaji: koto ni suru
formation:
  Verb (dictionary form) + ことにする: To decide to do something.
  Verb (ない form) + ことにする: To decide not to do something. You are creating a new rule for yourself or making
    a personal resolution. It emphasizes a deliberate choice rather than just a plan or intention. It
    can also be used for a group decision where the speaker is part of the decision-making body (e.g.,
    'we decided').
jlpt: N3
etymology: The grammar point 「ことにする」 combines 「こと」 (koto), a nominalizer that transforms verbs or phrases
  into noun equivalents, with 「にする」 (ni suru), which means "to decide" or "to make something so." Therefore,
  「ことにする」 literally translates to "to make it a matter" or "to make it a thing" that one does. This construction
  highlights the speaker's conscious and deliberate act of making a decision.
writeup: '「ことにする」 (koto ni suru) is used to express a personal decision or resolution to do (or not to
  do) something, or to establish a new habit. It signifies a choice actively made by the speaker. This
  grammar point uses 「こと」 as a nominalizer, meaning the verb or verb phrase preceding it must be in its
  plain form (dictionary form for affirmative decisions, or the negative (ない) form for decisions not to
  do something). The 「にする」 portion then explicitly states that this nominalized action is the *thing*
  one decides upon. For example: * 「毎日、運動することにする」 (mainichi undō suru koto ni suru) means "I''ve decided
  to exercise every day." * 「甘いものを食べないことにする」 (amai mono o tabenai koto ni suru) means "I''ve decided not
  to eat sweets." The use of 「ことにする」 conveys a stronger sense of personal will and commitment compared
  to simply stating an intention. It implies a firm resolve. When used in its past tense, 「ことにした」, it
  indicates a decision that has already been made and is now a settled matter. While the basic form is
  「ことにする」, it conjugates like a regular する verb, allowing for various tense and politeness levels, such
  as 「ことにします」 (polite non-past), 「ことにした」 (plain past), and 「ことにしませんでした」 (polite negative past). The volitional
  forms 「ことにしよう」 and 「ことにしましょう」 can be used to suggest making a decision, either to oneself or to others.'
false_friends:
  - term: にする
    meaning: To decide on, to choose, to make something into
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ことにする」 specifically implies a decision about an action or course of action, 「にする」 is
      broader and can be used for choosing objects or making general decisions. For example, 「コーヒーにする」
      (kōhī ni suru) means "I'll have coffee."
    grammar_point: にする (to decide or make)
  - term: ようにする
    meaning: To try to, to make sure to, to endeavor to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようにする」 implies an effort or attempt to do something regularly, suggesting an ongoing habit
      or goal. In contrast, 「ことにする」 is a firm, definite decision made at a specific point in time. For
      example, 「早く寝るようにする」 (hayaku neru yō ni suru) means "I'll try to go to bed early," whereas 「早く寝ることにする」
      (hayaku neru koto ni suru) is a firm decision to go to bed early.
    grammar_point: ようにする (make an effort to)
  - term: ことになる
    meaning: It will end up being, it is the result of, it has been decided that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ことになる」 expresses a result or a decision made by someone else or by circumstances, not a personal
      decision like 「ことにする」. It conveys an outcome that is often beyond the speaker's direct control or
      simply a report of a factual outcome. For example, 「来月、転勤することになる」 (raigetsu, tenkin suru koto ni
      naru) means "It has been decided that I will be transferred next month (by someone else or circumstances)."
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ことになる (it has been decided・to turn out that)'
  - term: つもりだ
    meaning: Intention or conviction
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ことにする」 signifies a firm decision or resolve, 「つもりだ」 expresses a personal intention,
      plan, or belief. The former implies a more concrete and deliberate choice to act, whereas the latter
      is more about one's mindset or outlook. For example, 「今日 は 勉強 する つもり だ」 (kyō wa benkyō suru tsumori
      da) means "I intend to study today," which is an intention, not necessarily a firm, self-imposed
      rule like 「今日 は 勉強 する こと に する」 (kyō wa benkyō suru koto ni suru).
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]つもりだ (to intend to)'
post_false_friends_writeup: The key difference among these expressions lies in the degree of intent and
  control. 「ことにする」 reflects a personal resolution, an active choice made by the speaker. 「ようにする」 suggests
  an ongoing effort or attempt to establish a habit. Conversely, 「ことになる」 indicates an outcome or a decision
  made by external factors or by the general flow of events, not a personal, active choice by the speaker.
  Finally, 「つもりだ」 focuses on the speaker's internal intention or belief, rather than a definitive decision
  to implement a new action or rule.

  - english: From now on, I've decided to exercise every day.
    japanese:
      - これ から、毎日 運動 {する こと に する}
      - これ から、毎日 運動 {する こと に し ます}

      - competing_japanese:
          - これ から、毎日 運動 する {つもり だ}。
        english: From now on, I intend to exercise every day.
        hint: 「つもりだ」 expresses an intention or plan, but it lacks the strong sense of personal commitment
          found in 「ことにする」. We're looking for a firm, self-imposed decision.
    scene: A person setting a personal resolution for a healthier lifestyle.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「することにする」 emphasizes a personal, firm decision about a future action or a new habit. This
      phrasing implies a strong internal commitment.

          attempt. We're looking for a definite decision not to do something.
    scene: A person starting a diet, expressing their commitment to avoid certain foods.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: 「食べないことにする」 expresses a strong personal resolution to abstain from an action. This is more
      resolute than simply stating an intention.
  - english: We've decided to start tomorrow's meeting at 9 o'clock.
    japanese:
      - 明日 の 会議 は、九 時 に 開始 {する こと に し まし た}

        english: It has been decided that tomorrow's meeting will start at 9 o'clock.
        hint: 「ことになる」 indicates an outcome or a decision made by external factors or circumstances, not
          a personal decision. We're looking for an active decision made by the speaker or group.
    scene: A male team leader informing his colleagues about a fixed meeting time.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「することにしました」 in this professional context emphasizes a formal decision made by or on behalf
      of a group, using the polite form suitable for announcements. The male speaker's use implies a clear,
      authoritative statement.
  - english: Since I was busy, I decided to eat dinner out.
    japanese:
      - 忙しかっ た の で、夕飯 は 外 で 食べる {こと に し た}

        english: Since I was busy, it ended up that I ate dinner out.
        hint: 「ことになる」 here suggests that the situation or circumstances led to this outcome, not necessarily
          a direct personal decision. We're looking for a decision made by the speaker.
    scene: A woman recounting her day and how she handled a busy schedule.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female

      personal choice in a casual setting. It implies a settled course of action.

        english: It's raining today, so let's make the picnic next week.
        hint: This phrasing is a simple suggestion or agreement for an action. It doesn't carry the nuance
          of a formal or collective 'decision' about a specific plan. We're looking for a mutual decision-making
          process.
    scene: Two friends making alternative plans due to unexpected weather.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: volitional (～よう)

      a sense of proposing a joint resolution.

    japanese:
      - 皆 の 意見 を 聞い て、この 計画 を 実行 {する こと に し まし た}

        hint: 「ことになる」 expresses that something has been decided, often by external factors or as a general
          outcome. We're looking for an active decision made by the group (including the speaker).
    scene: A male project manager explaining the outcome of a team discussion to stakeholders.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「することにしました」 explicitly indicates a decision made by the speaker or a group they belong to,
      often after deliberation, and conveys a sense of finality.
  - english: Regarding that matter, why don't we decide not to say anything this time?
    japanese:
      - あの 件 に つい て は、今回 は 何 も {言わ ない こと に し ませ ん か}
      - あの 件 に つい て は、今回 は 何 も {言わ ない こと に し ましょう か}
    english_literally: That matter about, this time nothing not to say won't we decide?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 件 に つい て は、今回 は 何 も {言わ ない 方 が いい} の で は ない です か。
        english: Regarding that matter, isn't it better not to say anything this time?
        hint: This is a direct suggestion about what action would be best. It doesn't imply forming a
          mutual 'decision' or resolution, but rather recommends a course of action. We're looking for
          a collective decision.
    scene: A colleague suggesting a discreet approach to a sensitive issue during a team meeting.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: negotiating
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    nuance: 「言わないことにしませんか」 is a polite suggestion to make a collective decision *not* to do something,
      often used in a gentle persuasive manner. The negative question form softens the proposal, making
      it less direct.
  - english: I hesitated a lot, but in the end, I did not decide to quit the company.
    japanese:
      - 色々 迷っ た が、結局 会社 を 辞める {こと に し なかっ た}

        english: I hesitated a lot, but in the end, I didn't quit the company.
        hint: This simply states that the action of quitting didn't occur. It doesn't emphasize a conscious
          decision *not* to quit, which 「ことにしなかった」 does. We're looking for the explicit decision to not
          do something.
    scene: A young professional reflecting on a major career decision.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「ことにしなかった」 indicates that a specific decision, which might have been expected or considered,
      was ultimately not made. It conveys a sense of resolution in *not* pursuing a particular course
      of action.
  - english: We did not decide to make the report's submission deadline the end of the month.
    japanese:
      - その 報告 書 の 提出 期限 は、月末 に する {こと に し ませ ん でし た}

    english_literally: That report's submission deadline, end of month to do did not decide (polite).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 報告 書 の 提出 期限 は、月末 に {し ませ ん でし た}。
        english: We did not make the report's submission deadline the end of the month.
        hint: This simply states that the deadline was not set for the end of the month. It doesn't explicitly
          mention that a decision *not* to do so was made. We're looking for a formal statement about
          a decision that was not reached.
    scene: A business manager clarifying a recent decision regarding project timelines.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)

      possibilities. It's often used in formal reports or discussions to convey a precise outcome.
  - english: I decided to study all day today, and turned down invitations to hang out.

    english_literally: Today all day study having decided, play's invitations turned down.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 一 日中 勉強 する {つもり で}、遊び の 誘い を 断っ た。
        english: I intended to study all day today, so I turned down invitations to hang out.
        hint: 「つもりで」 expresses a prior intention or plan that serves as a reason for a subsequent action.
          While similar, 「ことにして」 specifically emphasizes a firm, often conscious, decision that directly
          led to the following action. We're looking for a decision as the direct cause.
    scene: A student explaining why they couldn't join their friends for leisure.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: 「ことにして」 connects two actions, indicating that the first action (deciding to study) was the
      reason or preceding condition for the second (turning down invitations).
  - english: If we decide not to invite him, no problems should arise.
    japanese:
      - 彼 を 誘わ ない {こと に すれ ば}、問題 は 起き ない はず だ
      - 彼 を 誘わ ない {こと に し たら}、問題 は 起き ない はず だ
    english_literally: Him not invite if decide, problems won't arise it should be.
    competing_grammar:

          - 彼 を 誘わ {なけれ ば}、問題 は 起き ない はず だ。
        english: If we don't invite him, no problems should arise.
        hint: This is a simple conditional statement about an action. It doesn't explicitly include the
          nuance of making a 'decision' not to invite someone, which 「ことにすれば」 emphasizes. We're looking
          for a conditional based on a decision.
    scene: Friends discussing how to avoid conflict in a social gathering.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: conditional (～ば)
    nuance: 「ことにすれば」 implies a hypothetical decision and its expected consequence. It's used to consider
      a plan of action and its implications, often for problem-solving.
  - english: If we decide to go to Kyoto by Shinkansen, we'll arrive much faster.
    japanese:
      - 京都 へ 新 幹線 で 行く {こと に し たら}、もっと 早く 着ける よ
      - 京都 へ 新 幹線 で 行く {こと に すれ ば}、もっと 早く 着ける よ
    english_literally: Kyoto to Shinkansen by go if decide, much faster can arrive (informal emphasis).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 京都 へ 新 幹線 で {行け ば}、もっと 早く 着ける よ。
        english: If we go to Kyoto by Shinkansen, we'll arrive much faster.
        hint: This is a straightforward conditional about taking an action. It lacks the emphasis on making
          a 'decision' to take that action, which 「ことにしたら」 highlights. We're looking for a conditional
          based on a decision.
    scene: A person suggesting an efficient travel method to a friend planning a trip.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    nuance: 「ことにしたら」, similar to ば, presents a hypothetical decision. It offers a suggestion based on
      a potential choice, emphasizing a positive outcome, like using the Shinkansen for speed.
  - english: It's up to you. But this is the last time. Decide to stop this!
    japanese:
      - 君 の 勝手 だ。だ が、もう これ で 最後 だ。これ を {やめる こと に しろ}！
      - 君 の 勝手 だ。だ が、もう これ で 最後 だ。これ を {やめる こと に せよ}！
    english_literally: Your selfishness. But, already this last time. This to stop decide!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 君 の 勝手 だ。だ が、もう これ で 最後 だ。これ を {やめろ}！
        english: It's up to you. But this is the last time. Stop this!
        hint: This is a simple, direct command. It focuses on the action itself, not the act of making
          a decision to perform that action, which is the nuance of 「ことにしろ」. We're looking for a command
          to make a decision.
    scene: A male boss giving a final, stern warning to a subordinate about an undesirable behavior.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The imperative 「やめることにしろ」 is an extremely forceful and unnatural direct command to *make*
      a decision. Its rarity is "very rare" because this grammar point typically expresses one's *own*
      decision, making such a direct command awkward and overly aggressive in most contexts.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「ことにする」 is versatile, allowing you to express
  personal decisions across various tenses and politeness levels. The nuance consistently revolves around
  a conscious, active choice made by the speaker or a group. Pay close attention to how it differs from
  similar expressions like 「ことになる」 and 「ようにする」, especially when conveying who made the decision or the
  firmness of the resolution.
