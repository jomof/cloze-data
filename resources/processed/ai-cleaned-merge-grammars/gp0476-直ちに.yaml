        "直ちに + Verb": "The adverb 直ちに modifies a verb, indicating immediate and direct action.",

        "part-of-speech": "adverb",

        "usage-context": "Typically used in formal speech, official announcements, or when conveying a strong, urgent command or intention."
    },
    "etymology": "直ちに (tadachi ni) derives from the kanji 直 (choku), meaning 'direct' or 'straight.' This etymological root clearly reflects the core nuance of the word: an action is carried out directly, without deviation or delay, and often with a sense of purpose or intention. It implies a 'straightforward' and 'immediate' response.",
    "writeup": "The adverb **直ちに (tadachi ni)** is used to convey that an action or event occurs \"immediately,\" \"at once,\" or \"without delay.\" It carries a strong nuance of directness and often purposefulness, implying that the action is a direct, intentional response to a preceding situation or command. While it can appear anywhere an adverb would, it is frequently placed at the beginning of a sentence to emphasize its immediate nature.\n\n**直ちに** is often found in formal contexts, such as official directives, public announcements, or when expressing a firm, urgent intention. For example, in emergency situations, you might hear instructions like 「直ちに避難してください」(Please evacuate immediately), where the immediacy and directness are critical.\n\nIt is important to distinguish **直ちに** from other adverbs that mean 'immediately,' such as **忽ち (tachimachi)** or **すぐに (sugu ni)**. While **すぐに** is a general and widely used term for 'immediately,' **直ちに** emphasizes a more formal, decisive, and often intentional immediacy. **忽ち**, on the other hand, describes something happening 'immediately' but often implies a sudden, spontaneous, or unintentional change, like something spreading quickly without direct human intervention.",

            "meaning": "Immediately, quickly, suddenly, in a moment or flash",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "Unlike 直ちに, たちまち emphasizes the speed and suddenness of the action, often without the intentional or direct aspect. It describes something that happens spontaneously or naturally, rather than as a deliberate response."

            "term": "か～ないかのうちに",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "か～ないかのうちに focuses on the near simultaneity of two events, highlighting that the second event happens almost immediately after the first. It describes the timing of events rather than a direct, intentional action following another."

            "meaning": "As soon as",

            "nuance": "次第 (shidai) implies a sequence or procedure to be followed, often with a sense of completion before the next step. While it denotes immediacy, it's more about 'as soon as [X is done], then [Y will happen]' and often involves a pre-arranged plan, contrasting with 直ちに's emphasis on a direct, urgent response."

            "nuance": "とたんに indicates something happens at the very moment something else occurs, often resulting in an immediate and unexpected change. It highlights the instantaneous nature of a consequence or new state, without necessarily implying the intentionality or formal urgency of 直ちに."

        {
            "term": "すぐに",
            "meaning": "Immediately, right away, soon",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "すぐに (sugu ni) is the most common and general term for 'immediately.' While it expresses promptness, it lacks the formal register, strong intentionality, and sense of directness that 直ちに conveys. It can be used in almost any context, whereas 直ちに is typically reserved for more formal or critical situations."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between these expressions, consider the nuance of immediacy you wish to convey. Use 直ちに for actions that are direct, purposeful, and often carry a sense of urgency or formality. If the focus is on suddenness or an unintentional, rapid change, たちまち might be more appropriate. For nearly simultaneous events or quick, unexpected transitions, か～ないかのうちに or とたんに are suitable. 次第 implies a sequential immediacy, often based on a pre-established plan. Lastly, すぐに is the most versatile and general term for 'immediately,' used when the specific nuances of directness, purpose, or formality are not emphasized.",
