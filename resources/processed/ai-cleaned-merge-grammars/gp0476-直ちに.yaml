        "直ちに + Verb": "The adverb 直ちに modifies a verb, indicating immediate and direct action.",

        "part-of-speech": "adverb",

        "usage-context": "Typically used in formal speech, official announcements, or when conveying a strong, urgent command or intention."
    },
    "etymology": "直ちに (tadachi ni) derives from the kanji 直 (choku), meaning 'direct' or 'straight.' This etymological root clearly reflects the core nuance of the word: an action is carried out directly, without deviation or delay, and often with a sense of purpose or intention. It implies a 'straightforward' and 'immediate' response.",
    "writeup": "The adverb **直ちに (tadachi ni)** is used to convey that an action or event occurs \"immediately,\" \"at once,\" or \"without delay.\" It carries a strong nuance of directness and often purposefulness, implying that the action is a direct, intentional response to a preceding situation or command. While it can appear anywhere an adverb would, it is frequently placed at the beginning of a sentence to emphasize its immediate nature.\n\n**直ちに** is often found in formal contexts, such as official directives, public announcements, or when expressing a firm, urgent intention. For example, in emergency situations, you might hear instructions like 「直ちに避難してください」(Please evacuate immediately), where the immediacy and directness are critical.\n\nIt is important to distinguish **直ちに** from other adverbs that mean 'immediately,' such as **忽ち (tachimachi)** or **すぐに (sugu ni)**. While **すぐに** is a general and widely used term for 'immediately,' **直ちに** emphasizes a more formal, decisive, and often intentional immediacy. **忽ち**, on the other hand, describes something happening 'immediately' but often implies a sudden, spontaneous, or unintentional change, like something spreading quickly without direct human intervention.",
