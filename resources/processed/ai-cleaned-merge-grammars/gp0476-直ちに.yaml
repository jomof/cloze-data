    "etymology": "The word 「直ちに」 comes from the kanji 「直」 (choku), meaning 'direct' or 'straight'. The 「に」 (ni) is a particle that often turns nouns into adverbs. Therefore, 「直ちに」 implies doing something directly and without delay.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「直ちに」 is commonly used to convey that something happens \"immediately\" or \"at once\". Like many adverbs, it frequently appears at the beginning of a sentence.\n\n「直ちに」 often carries the nuance that something is done \"directly\" and purposefully, usually after something else has happened or been completed. To indicate things that happen immediately but unintentionally, 「忽ち」 may be used.",
