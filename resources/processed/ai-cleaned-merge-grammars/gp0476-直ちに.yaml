    "etymology": "直ちに comes from the kanji 直 (choku), meaning 'direct.' This implies that the action is carried out directly and intentionally after something else has occurred.",
    "writeup": "The adverb **直ちに (tadachi ni)** is used to express that something happens \"immediately\" or \"at once.\" It typically appears at the beginning of a sentence. Unlike other words meaning 'immediately,' 直ちに often carries the nuance that something is done **directly** and **purposely**, usually after something happens or is completed. To indicate things that happen immediately, but unintentionally, 忽ち (tachimachi) may be used.",
