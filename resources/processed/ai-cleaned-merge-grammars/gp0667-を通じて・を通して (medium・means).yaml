jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to express means of communication, experience, or continuous duration over time
    or space.
  function: Indicates the channel, method, or continuous span.
  nuance: 「を通じて」 often implies a more formal, consistent, or widespread medium (e.g., "through media,"
    "throughout history"), or a collective experience. 「を通して」 can denote passage through a physical or
    abstract entity, or a direct means. It is also more commonly used for continuous duration (e.g., "all
    through the year," "throughout one's life"), sometimes carrying a nuance of having gained something
    through the experience.
etymology: The expressions 「を通じて」 and 「を通して」 both originate from the transitive verb 「通す (tōsu)」 and the
  intransitive verb 「通じる (tsūjiru)」, which share the fundamental concept of "passing through" or "making
  a path." 「通す」 means to pass something through, to let something go through, or to carry out an action
  continuously. 「通じる」 means to get through, to be understood, or to lead to. The particle 「を」 marks the
  noun as the object or medium that is traversed or used. Over time, these forms evolved to express both
  the **means or channel** through which something is done (e.g., communicating *through* a language)
  and the **continuous duration or scope** over which something extends (e.g., studying *throughout* the
  year). The nuances between them developed as 「通じる」 emphasizes connection and transmission, while 「通す」
  emphasizes the act of passing or persistence.
writeup: |-
  「を通じて」 and 「を通して」 are versatile grammatical expressions in Japanese, both indicating a path, a means, or a duration. While often interchangeable, they carry subtle differences in nuance and common usage.

  **Usage 1: Indicating a Medium or Means (～を通して/～を通じて)**
  This is the most common use, signifying that something is done *through* or *via* a particular medium, channel, or person.
  *   **「を通じて」** often suggests a more formal, indirect, or established channel. It can imply a broader scope or a collective action. For instance, receiving information "through media" (メディアを通じて) or learning "through education" (教育を通じて). It also appears in expressions like "throughout history" (歴史を通じて).
  *   **「を通して」** can also indicate a medium, but it often implies a more direct passage or a specific experience gained *through* something. For example, communicating "through an interpreter" (通訳を通して) or understanding something "through experience" (経験を通して). It can emphasize the *process* of passing through.

  **Usage 2: Indicating Continuous Duration or Scope (～を通して)**
  In this usage, **「を通して」** (and less commonly 「を通じて」) signifies "throughout" or "all through" a certain period or range. It emphasizes continuity from beginning to end.
  *   Example: "working all through the night" (一晩を通して働く) or "remaining popular throughout the year" (一年を通して人気がある).
  This usage highlights that an action or state persists continuously over the specified time or area.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   **Formality**: Both forms are generally formal or semi-formal. In casual conversation, other expressions like 「で」 or simpler phrasing might be used.
  *   **Interchangeability**: In many contexts, 「を通じて」 and 「を通して」 are interchangeable, especially when referring to a medium or channel. However, 「を通して」 is more commonly used for continuous duration.
  *   **Historical Context**: Both derive from verbs meaning "to pass through," which helps in understanding their core meaning of traversing a medium or time.

  - term: によって (means・method)
    meaning: by means of; due to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「によって」 emphasizes the **agent** or **cause** behind an action or method. It's often used when
      an action is performed *by* someone/something, or *due to* a particular reason. In contrast, 「を通じて・を通して」
      emphasize the **channel** or **medium** through which an action or state extends. Think of 「によって」
      as focusing on *who* or *what* initiates, and 「を通じて・を通して」 on *how* it gets there or *over what span*.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:によって (means・method)
  - term: を介して・介した (through an intermediary)
    meaning: through an intermediary; via
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「を介して」 specifically implies using a **person** or a **specific mediating entity** as an intermediary.
      It's more restrictive than 「を通じて・を通して」, which can refer to broader concepts like "media," "education,"
      or "experience" as channels, not just specific intermediaries.
    grammar_point: を介して・介した (through an intermediary)
  - term: あいだ (between・among・while・during)
    meaning: between; among; while; during
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both can relate to duration, 「を通して」 emphasizes a continuous state *throughout* the entire
      period. 「あいだ」 indicates a period *within* which something happens, or a duration *between* two points.
      It doesn't necessarily imply continuous presence or action for the whole duration.
    grammar_point: あいだ (between・among・while・during)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To summarize the distinctions: when considering the means or channel, 「によって」
  highlights the actor or reason, 「を介して」 specifies a distinct intermediary, while 「を通じて・を通して」 point to
  a general medium or channel. For duration, 「を通して」 signifies continuity across the entire period, whereas
  「あいだ」 refers to a span within which events occur, or a period between things. Choosing the right expression
  depends on whether you want to emphasize the agent, the specific intermediary, the general channel,
  or the continuous nature of a duration.'
