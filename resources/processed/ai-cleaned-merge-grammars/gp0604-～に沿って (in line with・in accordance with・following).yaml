jlpt: N2
etymology: The grammar point 「に沿って」 comes from the verb 「沿う (そう)」, meaning "to run along, follow". The
  「て」-form indicates a state or manner of following. Thus, 「に沿って」 literally means "following along with"
  something.
writeup: 「に沿って」 expresses that something is done by following "along with" (A), "in accordance with" (A),
  or "in line with" (A). The core nuance is that (A) serves as the controlling factor, and (B) is performed
  with that consideration in mind. It is frequently used with rules, laws, guidelines, plans, or physical
  paths. While typically seen in its て-form as 「に沿って」, the verb 「沿う」 can also appear in its dictionary
  form when it directly modifies a subsequent noun. For example, 「希望に沿う商品」 (a product that is in line
  with expectations). This construction functions adjectivally, describing the noun as something that
  conforms to or follows a particular standard or concept. As the base meaning of 「沿う」 is "to follow along,"
  it is also commonly used in a literal sense to describe moving along a specific path or street. Though
  the grammar structure generally conveys a sense of formality, its literal usage for physical alignment
  is quite common in everyday conversation.

  - term: と並んで
    meaning: In line with, Comparable with, Along with, Just like, As… as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「と並んで」 can mean "in line with," it often carries a stronger sense of comparison or being
      side-by-side (literally or figuratively), unlike 「に沿って」 which primarily implies following a guideline,
      rule, or physical path.
    grammar_point: と並んで (comparable with)
  - term: に応じて
    meaning: Depending or based on, According to, In response to, Suitable for or to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に応じて」 means "depending on" or "in response to," highlighting a reaction or adaptation to
      changing circumstances. In contrast, 「に沿って」 emphasizes adherence to a fixed standard or plan, rather
      than dynamic adjustment.
    grammar_point: に応じて (depending on)
  - term: に従って・従い
    meaning: As; in accordance with; following; in proportion to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にしたがって」 also means "following" or "in accordance with," but it often implies a chronological
      sequence, a cause-and-effect relationship, or a natural progression (e.g., 'as time passes'). 「に沿って」,
      however, focuses on adherence to a guiding principle or path.
    grammar_point: に従って・従い (in accordance with and proportional change)
  - term: に伴って・に伴い
    meaning: Along with, As a result of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に伴って」 indicates something that occurs simultaneously with or as a direct consequence of another
      event or change. This is distinct from 「に沿って」, which suggests adherence to a plan or rule, irrespective
      of a causal relationship or simultaneous occurrence.
    grammar_point: に伴って・に伴い (along with・as a result of)
  - term: ～ままに
    meaning: Do as (one is told or ordered…), In accordance with, In compliance with, Just like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ままに」 implies doing something exactly as instructed, or as things are, often with a nuance
      of being passively led. 「に沿って」, while denoting adherence, suggests a more deliberate act of aligning
      one's actions with a standard or guideline.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-(ら)れる]ままに (as one is told)'
  - term: に則って・に則り
    meaning: According to, In accordance with, Based on, In line with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に則って」 is very similar to 「に沿って」 in meaning 'in accordance with'. However, 「に則って」 specifically
      emphasizes adhering to laws, regulations, principles, or established norms, often in a more formal
      or legalistic context. 「に沿って」 has a broader application, including physical paths and less rigid
      guidelines.
    grammar_point: に則って・に即して (in accordance with)
  - term: 通り
    meaning: Exactly as, according to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「通り」 emphasizes strict, exact replication or adherence (e.g., 「指示通り」 for 'exactly as
      instructed'), 「に沿って」 implies following a guideline or path with a degree of flexibility, especially
      in processes or physical routes. It means acting in alignment with, rather than precisely copying.
    grammar_point: とおり (exactly as)
  - term: にもとづいて
    meaning: Based on, founded on
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に基づいて」 means 'based on' or 'founded on', referring to the origin or fundamental principle.
      It implies deriving an action or conclusion *from* something. In contrast, 「に沿って」 describes carrying
      out an action *along* a path or guideline, focusing on the method of adherence rather than the foundation.
    grammar_point: にもとづいて (based on)
post_false_friends_writeup: While many of these expressions share the meaning of "in accordance with"
  or "following," their specific nuances differ significantly. 「に沿って」 suggests adhering to a guideline,
  plan, or path, emphasizing alignment and often allowing for practical flexibility. In contrast, 「通り」
  implies strict, exact replication. 「に応じて」 highlights adaptation to changing circumstances, while 「にしたがって」
  often refers to chronological sequence or cause-and-effect. 「に伴って」 highlights simultaneous occurrence
  or consequence. 「に基づいて」 means 'based on' or 'founded on', referring to the origin or fundamental principle.
  「に則って」 is particularly used for strict adherence to formal laws or principles, being more rigid than
  「に沿って」. Choosing the appropriate expression hinges on precisely capturing the nature of the relationship
  between the action and the standard being followed, considering the degree of flexibility, the nature
  of the guiding element, and whether it's a foundation or a path.

      - 会社 の ルール {に 沿っ て}、残業 する 人 は 必ず タイム カード を 押し て から に し て ください。

        english: Following the company rules, please make sure to clock in before you begin overtime.
        hint: 「に従って」 often implies strict obedience or following a command, which might feel too rigid
          for general company procedures. We are looking for an phrase that suggests adherence to a guideline.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会社 の ルール {に 基づい て}、残業 を する 方 は 必ず タイム カード を 押し て から に し て ください。
        english: Based on the company rules, please make sure to clock in before you begin overtime.
        hint: 「に基づいて」 means 'based on' or 'founded on', referring to the origin or foundation of an action.
          We are looking for an expression that emphasizes the ongoing action of aligning with the rules.
    scene: A manager is reminding employees about the correct procedure for recording overtime.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The formal tone is established by the use of polite language, such as the verb ending 「ください」
      for polite instruction. The phrase 「タイムカードを 押してから」 specifies the action of clocking in. Using 「方」
      for 'person' or 'people' adds formality, while 「人」 is slightly less formal but still polite in this
      context. Although 「に従って」 or 「に基づいて」 could technically be used, 「に沿って」 is the most natural fit here,
      implying a guiding rule rather than strict obedience or foundation. The manager wants to convey
      that this is part of the established procedure, not an arbitrary command. The nuance implies adherence
      to a guideline rather than a strict command.
  - english: We would like to proceed in accordance with the client's wishes.
    japanese:

        english: We would like to proceed exactly as the client wishes.
        hint: 「～通りに」 implies exact replication, which might be too strict or inflexible in a business
          context. We are looking for an expression that suggests aligning with wishes as a guideline,
          allowing for flexibility.
      - competing_japanese:
          - クライアント 様 の 希望 {に 合わせ て} 進め たい と 思い ます。
        english: We would like to proceed by adjusting to the client's wishes.
        hint: 「～に合わせて」 means 'adjusting to' or 'matching', implying a more flexible or responsive approach.
          We are looking for an expression that emphasizes adherence to a principle rather than dynamic
          adaptation.
    scene: A junior employee reporting a proposal to their boss.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The polite expression 「～と思います」 indicates a humble opinion or plan, common in business. The
      honorific 「様」 in 「クライアント様」 shows deference and respect to the client. Both 「に沿う」 (modifying 方向)
      and 「に沿って」 (modifying the verb 進め たい) are natural ways to express alignment. The nuance of 「に沿って」
      conveys a careful alignment with the client's general direction or principles, without necessarily
      committing to every single detail, which is often crucial in negotiations and client relations.
      This flexibility is what makes it distinct from more rigid expressions like 「～通りに」. By using 「に沿って」,
      the speaker communicates professionalism and a cooperative spirit. This is a common and appropriate
      use of the grammar point in business settings.

        english: We will do our best to build you a home exactly as the client wishes within your budget!
        hint: 「～通り」 implies exact replication, which isn't always feasible in custom building. We are
          looking for an expression that conveys meeting general needs and preferences as guidelines,
          suitable for a persuasive sales pitch.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ご 予算 内 で お 客 様 の ご 希望 {に 合わせ た} お 家 を 建てれる よう 全力 を 尽くし ます！
        english: We will do our best to build you a home adjusted to your needs within your budget!
        hint: Similar to 「～通り」, 「～に合わせて」 focuses on adaptation rather than adherence to a set of client-defined
          requirements. We are looking for an expression that emphasizes proactive alignment with stated
          needs.
    scene: A sales representative for a housing company speaking to a potential buyer.
    register: formal
    setting: persuasive
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of polite 「ます」-form verbs and the commitment phrase 「全力を尽くします」 convey professionalism.
      The honorific 「ご」 in 「ご予算」 and 「ご希望」 shows respect to the customer. Both 「に沿った」 and 「に沿う」 are valid
      for modifying 「お家」. The casual 「建てれる」 (a common contraction of 建てられる) is often heard in speech,
      but the standard form is 「建てられる」. This example shows that 「に沿う」, when used to modify a noun, can
      indicate the result of aligning with a plan or wish. 「に沿った」 is the past tense form, implying that
      the house *was built* in accordance with the wishes, but here it's used to describe the *kind* of
      house that will be built. This is a common usage where the past tense form of a verb functions as
      a descriptive adjective, emphasizing that the house will embody the alignment with the wishes.
  - english: Please cut along this dotted line.
    japanese:
      - この 点線 {に 沿っ て} 切っ て ください。

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 点線 の {通り} に 切っ て ください。
        english: Please cut exactly according to this dotted line.
        hint: While similar, 「～通りに」 often implies exact replication. We are looking for an expression
          that suggests using the dotted line as a guiding path for the action of cutting, allowing for
          natural movement along it.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 点線 {に 従っ て} 切っ て ください。
        english: Please cut obeying this dotted line.
        hint: 「～に従って」 suggests obeying or following a command. For a physical action like cutting a line,
          「に沿って」 more aptly describes the action of tracing along it.
    scene: Instructions on a craft project for children.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The instruction 「切って ください」 is a polite request, common in manuals or when giving directions
      for a task. Omitting 「この」 (this) for 「点線」 (dotted line) is common in instructional contexts when
      the context makes it clear which line is being referred to. This example demonstrates the literal
      use of 「に沿って」 for physical movement along a line. It conveys a clear, direct instruction for an
      action. The choice of 「に沿って」 over 「～通りに」 for a physical line is subtle but important. 「～通りに」 might
      imply a strict, precise adherence that feels rigid, whereas 「に沿って」 for a physical path naturally
      describes the action of moving *along* it, which can be less rigid. Imagine cutting with scissors;
      you are following the line, not necessarily replicating it perfectly. This nuance makes 「に沿って」 suitable
      for actions involving a guiding line or path.

          - 道 を {まっすぐ} 行っ たら、その うち スーパー が 見え て き ます よ。
        english: If you go straight on the road, the supermarket will eventually come into view.
        hint: 「まっすぐ」 implies a straight path, which might not be the case for a winding road. 「に沿って」 is
          better for paths that may curve or wind, indicating continuous adherence to the road's course.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 道 を {辿っ て} 行っ たら、その うち スーパー が 見え て き ます よ。
        english: If you trace along the road, the supermarket will eventually come into view.
        hint: 「辿る」 means 'to trace' or 'follow' (a course), but it can imply a more exploratory or searching
          journey. 「に沿って」 simply means following along a known path.
    scene: A local resident giving directions to a lost tourist.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The sentence-ending particle 「～よ」 adds emphasis and a friendly tone, providing reassurance
      when giving directions. Removing 「よ」 makes it simply polite. The phrase 「見えてきます」 naturally describes
      something gradually becoming visible as one approaches. This example illustrates another literal
      usage of 「に沿って」, referring to following a road or path. It's a natural way to give directions, conveying
      movement alongside something, regardless of whether it's straight or winding. This contrasts with
      「まっすぐ」, which implies only a straight path. 「に沿って」 is the most versatile option for general directions
      that involve following a physical route.

        english: We plan on developing new products exactly as the client wishes.
        hint: As with previous examples, 「～通り」 implies an exact match. We are looking for an expression
          that describes a broader alignment with client expectations for new products, not a strict fulfillment
          of a specific design request.
      - competing_japanese:
          - クライアント の 希望 {に 基づい て} 新 製品 を 開発 する 予定 です。
        english: We plan on developing new products based on our clients' expectations.
        hint: 「～に基づいて」 means 'based on', which suggests the wishes are a foundation. We are looking for
          an expression that emphasizes the new product itself being aligned with the wishes as a guiding
          principle during development.
    scene: A company director making a presentation to investors about future initiatives.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「開発する 予定です」 indicates a planned future action, common in official statements or
      business plans, conveying commitment to product innovation. Both 「に沿った」 and 「に沿う」 are valid for
      modifying 「新製品」. Using 「お客様 の ご 希望」 instead of 「クライアント の 希望」 elevates the formality and politeness
      level. This example emphasizes that the product itself will be developed *in line with* the expectations,
      not just *based on* them. 「に沿う」 as a dictionary form modifying the noun 「新製品」 highlights the intended
      alignment of the product with the clients' expectations. This demonstrates a proactive approach
      to product development, where the final product is expected to be a direct reflection of the stated
      desires.

        english: 'Manual: ''In case of fire, employees should gather in front of the supermarket obeying
          the evacuation plan.'''
        hint: While similar, 「～に従って」 can imply strict obedience. In a manual setting, 「に沿って」 better conveys
          following a procedure or guideline, which may involve minor situational adjustments within the
          broader plan.
      - competing_japanese:
          - マニュアル:従業 員 は 火災 の 際、避難 計画 {通り} に スーパー の 前 に 集まる こと。
        english: 'Manual: ''In case of fire, employees should gather in front of the supermarket exactly
          according to the evacuation plan.'''
        hint: 「～通りに」 suggests an exact, rigid following of a plan. Manuals often provide guidelines rather
          than precise, unalterable steps, making 「に沿って」 more suitable for describing adherence to a general
          scheme.
    scene: A supervisor reading a section from the company's emergency response manual during a training
      session.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The manual uses 「集まる こと」, a common grammatical form for stating rules or requirements in written
      documents. 「火災の際」 is a standard phrase meaning 'in case of fire' in emergency contexts. 「集合する」 is
      a more formal synonym for 「集まる」, often used in official or military contexts. This example again
      highlights 「に沿って」 for following a plan or procedure, emphasizing its use in formal, instructional
      contexts like manuals. It implies a degree of flexibility, allowing for common sense adjustments
      within the framework of the plan, which is often necessary in real-world emergency situations. The
      nuance is that the plan serves as a guiding principle, rather than an unalterable script, allowing
      for practical application.

        english: If they make it exactly according to this sample, most people can do it well.
        hint: 「～通りに」 implies exact replication, which might be too strict for a general crafting process
          where some artistic freedom or minor deviation is allowed. We are looking for an expression
          that suggests using the sample as a guiding pattern.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: If they make it referencing this sample, most people can do it well.
        hint: 「～を参考に」 means 'referencing' or 'using as a reference', which is weaker than actively 'following'
          or 'making in accordance with'. We are looking for an expression that implies a more direct
          adherence to the sample's method.
    scene: A teacher explaining a DIY craft project to a group of students.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The conditional form 「作れば」 indicates that a positive outcome is contingent upon following
      the sample. The phrase 「大抵の 人は」 emphasizes the broad effectiveness of this method in an instructional
      context. The first sentence is polite, while the second is its plain form. The third sentence uses
      more formal vocabulary like 「作成する」 (to produce/create) and 「方」 (person, polite form of 人). This
      example illustrates how 「に沿って」 is used for following a model or example. It implies that using the
      sample as a guide will lead to success, without demanding rigid, exact duplication. This flexibility
      is particularly useful in creative or instructional contexts where some individual interpretation
      or variation is acceptable, as long as the general principles are followed.

          flow of a live event. We are looking for an expression that suggests following the script as
          a guideline for content and flow, allowing for natural delivery.

          - この 台本 {に 従っ て} 司会 し て ください。
        english: Please lead the meeting obeying this script.
        hint: 「～に従って」 implies strict obedience. For a performance, following a script is about adherence
          to the artistic vision and flow, not mere obedience to a command.
    scene: A director giving final instructions to a stage host before a live performance.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The polite request 「司会 して ください」 asks the host to lead. In a performance context, following
      the script 「台本」 'in accordance with' means ensuring the sequence and content are consistent, allowing
      for natural delivery rather than strict memorization. 「司会 を お 願い し ます」 is another polite way to
      make the request, emphasizing that the speaker is asking for a favor. This example shows that 「に沿って」
      is also suitable for following a script, implying adherence to the content and flow without demanding
      an unthinking, robotic delivery. A good host will follow the script, but also engage the audience.
      「に沿って」 implies that you follow the guidelines, but that you may make minor adjustments. 「～通りに」 or
      「に従って」 would imply a more rigid, exact following that might not be desired for a dynamic performance.
  - english: Let's proceed with the project according to this plan.
    japanese:
      - この 計画 {に 沿っ て}、プロジェクト を 進め ましょう。
      - この 計画 {に 沿っ て}、プロジェクト を 進め よう。
      - この 計画 {に 沿っ て}、プロジェクト を 進め て いき ましょう。
    english_literally: Following this plan, let's proceed with the project.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 計画 {通り} に プロジェクト を 進め ましょう。
        english: Let's proceed with the project exactly according to this plan.
        hint: 「～通りに」 emphasizes precise adherence, which might not allow for necessary adaptations during
          a project. We are looking for an expression that suggests using the plan as a flexible guide.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 計画 {に 基づい て} プロジェクト を 進め ましょう。
        english: Let's proceed with the project based on this plan.
        hint: 「～に基づいて」 means 'based on' or 'founded on', suggesting the plan is the foundation, but not
          necessarily that every step will be strictly followed. We are looking for an expression that
          implies actively following the plan's course.
    scene: Team members discussing their next steps for a project.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「～ましょう」 indicates a collective decision or proposal, common when working in a team.
      「に沿って」 here implies using the plan as a guiding framework rather than a strict, unchangeable blueprint.
      The plain volitional 「進め よう」 is more casual, while 「進め て いき ましょう」 adds a nuance of continuous action
      or progression, common in project management discussions. This final example reinforces the use
      of 「に沿って」 for adhering to a plan or strategy, conveying that the plan serves as a guiding framework
      rather than a rigid set of rules. This allows for necessary flexibility and adaptation during project
      execution, which is often crucial for success. The nuance is that the plan provides direction without
      precluding necessary adjustments along the way.
  - english: This product was developed in accordance with customer feedback.
    japanese:
      - この 製品 は 顧客 の フィードバック {に 沿う} 形 で 開発 さ れ まし た。

          - この 製品 は 顧客 の フィードバック {通り} に 開発 さ れ まし た。
        english: This product was developed exactly according to customer feedback.
        hint: 「～通りに」 suggests exact replication of all feedback, which might not be practical for product
          development. We are looking for an expression that indicates the product aligns with the general
          direction of the feedback.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 製品 は 顧客 の フィードバック {に 基づい て} 開発 さ れ まし た。
        english: This product was developed based on customer feedback.
        hint: 「～に基づいて」 means 'based on' or 'founded on', which refers to the origin or foundation. We
          are looking for an expression that indicates the product's design followed the feedback as a
          guiding principle throughout its development.
    scene: A product manager explains the development process to the sales team.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This sentence emphasizes that the product's development was guided by the feedback. The phrase
      「～に沿う形で」 is a common collocation, meaning "in a form that follows/aligns with". It highlights that
      the final product's design and features were shaped by the customer input as a continuous guideline.
  - english: The artist painted the landscape by following the contours of the mountain.
    japanese:
      - その 画家 は 山 の 稜線 {に 沿っ て}、風景 を 描い た。
      - その 画家 は 山 の 稜線 {に 沿う} 描き 方 で 風景 を 描い た。
      - その 画家 は 山 の 稜線 {に 沿っ て}、風景 を 描き まし た。
      - その 画家 は 山 の 稜線 {に 沿う} 描き 方 で 風景 を 描き まし た。
    english_literally: The artist painted the landscape following the mountain's ridge line.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 画家 は 山 の 稜線 {通り} に、風景 を 描い た。
        english: The artist painted the landscape exactly according to the mountain's ridge line.
        hint: 「～通りに」 implies exact replication, which is less natural for artistic interpretation of contours.
          We are looking for an expression that describes the artist's action of following the lines as
          a guide.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 画家 は 山 の 稜線 {に 従っ て}、風景 を 描い た。
        english: The artist painted the landscape obeying the mountain's ridge line.
        hint: 「～に従って」 suggests a command or strict adherence, which doesn't fit the artistic process of
          observing and translating contours onto a canvas. We are looking for an expression that indicates
          a guiding path for the artistic action.
    scene: An art critic describes a painting.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This example highlights the literal meaning of following a physical line or shape. 「稜線」 refers
      to the ridge line or contour of a mountain. By using 「に沿って」, it conveys that the artist's brush
      strokes or compositional choices were guided along the natural lines of the landscape, demonstrating
      how the physical world served as a direct inspiration and framework for the artwork.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the precise nuance of 「に沿って」 compared to other expressions of adherence
  is key. While it implies following a guideline or path, it offers a degree of flexibility that more
  rigid phrases like 「～通り」 or 「～に従って」 might not. This flexibility is crucial in professional and creative
  contexts where strict adherence can stifle adaptability.
