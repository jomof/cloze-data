    "etymology": "This phrase literally means something akin to \"it doesn't even extend to saying,\" implying that the fact is so obvious it doesn't warrant mentioning.",
    "writeup": "`は言うまでもない` (wa iu made mo nai) expresses that something \"goes without saying\" or is \"needless to say.\" It emphasizes the obviousness of a statement. The particle `は` marks the topic, `言う` means \"to say,\" `まで` indicates \"up to\" or \"even,\" `も` adds emphasis, and `ない` negates, creating the overall sense that saying something is unnecessary. It is often followed by structures such as `が` to introduce a contrasting or additional point, highlighting that while the first part is obvious, there's a subsequent, perhaps less obvious, detail to consider.",
