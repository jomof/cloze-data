    "writeup": "は言うまでもない (wa iu made mo nai) expresses that something \"goes without saying\" or is \"needless to say.\" It emphasizes the obviousness of a statement. The particle は marks the topic, 言う means \"to say,\" まで indicates \"up to\" or \"even,\" も adds emphasis, and ない negates, creating the overall sense that saying something is unnecessary. It is often followed by structures such as が to introduce a contrasting or additional point, highlighting that while the first part is obvious, there's a subsequent, perhaps less obvious, detail to consider.",

It's often used when listing items where the first is clearly implied or understood, and the second is an obvious addition."

In contrast, 言うまでもなく often serves as a conjunction to introduce another point that is similarly obvious, implying a progression or addition of obvious facts. Pay attention to the particle that precedes them and the overall structure of the sentence.",
