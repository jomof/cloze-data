    "etymology": "This phrase literally means something akin to \"it doesn't even extend to saying,\" implying that the fact is so obvious it doesn't warrant mentioning.",
    "writeup": "`は言うまでもない` (wa iu made mo nai) expresses that something \"goes without saying\" or is \"needless to say.\" It emphasizes the obviousness of a statement. The particle `は` marks the topic, `言う` means \"to say,\" `まで` indicates \"up to\" or \"even,\" `も` adds emphasis, and `ない` negates, creating the overall sense that saying something is unnecessary. It is often followed by structures such as `が` to introduce a contrasting or additional point, highlighting that while the first part is obvious, there's a subsequent, perhaps less obvious, detail to consider.",

            "nuance": "While `は言うまでもない` emphasizes that a specific statement is obvious and doesn't require explicit mention, `言うまでもなく` often functions as an adverbial phrase, meaning \"needless to say\" or \"not to mention,\" typically introducing an additional point that is also obvious or goes without saying. It's often used when listing items where the first is clearly implied or understood, and the second is an obvious addition."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While `は言うまでもない` and `言うまでもなく` both convey obviousness, their usage differs. `は言うまでもない` focuses on the primary statement itself being self-evident. In contrast, `言うまでもなく` often serves as a conjunction to introduce another point that is similarly obvious, implying a progression or addition of obvious facts. Pay attention to the particle that precedes them and the overall structure of the sentence.",
