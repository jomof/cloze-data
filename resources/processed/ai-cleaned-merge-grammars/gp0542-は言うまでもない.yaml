    "etymology": "This phrase literally means something akin to \"it doesn't even extend to saying,\" implying that the fact is so obvious it doesn't warrant mentioning.",
    "writeup": "`は言うまでもない` (wa iu made mo nai) expresses that something \"goes without saying\" or is \"needless to say.\" It emphasizes the obviousness of a statement. The particle `は` marks the topic, `言う` means \"to say,\" `まで` indicates \"up to\" or \"even,\" `も` adds emphasis, and `ない` negates, creating the overall sense that saying something is unnecessary. It is often followed by structures such as `が` to introduce a contrasting or additional point, highlighting that while the first part is obvious, there's a subsequent, perhaps less obvious, detail to consider.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While `は言うまでもない` emphasizes that a specific statement is obvious and doesn't require explicit mention, `言うまでもなく` often functions as an adverbial phrase, meaning \"needless to say\" or \"not to mention,\" typically introducing an additional point that is also obvious or goes without saying. It's often used when listing items where the first is clearly implied or understood, and the second is an obvious addition."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While `は言うまでもない` and `言うまでもなく` both convey obviousness, their usage differs. `は言うまでもない` focuses on the primary statement itself being self-evident. In contrast, `言うまでもなく` often serves as a conjunction to introduce another point that is similarly obvious, implying a progression or addition of obvious facts. Pay attention to the particle that precedes them and the overall structure of the sentence.",

            "etymology": "「健康」 (kenkō) comes from combining 「健」 (ken), meaning 'healthy,' and 「康」 (kō), meaning 'peaceful' or 'healthy,' emphasizing a state of well-being. 「大切」 (taisetsu) originally meant 'to cherish' or 'to value greatly,' deriving from 「大」 (tai) meaning 'big' or 'great' and 「切」 (setsu) which implies importance or cruciality. Its use here indicates the great value placed on health. 「いう」 (iu) 'to say' and 「までもない」 'not even to reach that point' combine to create the nuance of something being so obvious that speaking about it is unnecessary."

            "etymology": "「毎日」 (mainichi) literally means 'every day,' formed from 「毎」 (mai) 'every' and 「日」 (nichi) 'day'. 「練習」 (renshū) combines 「練」 (ren) 'to train' and 「習」 (shū) 'to learn,' referring to practice or training. 「上達」 (jōtatsu) means 'improvement' or 'progress,' coming from 「上」 (jō) 'up' or 'superior' and 「達」 (tatsu) 'to reach' or 'to achieve', signifying reaching a higher level."

The nuance is further enhanced by the use of 「が」 (ga) to introduce a contrasting point, emphasizing that despite the obvious talent, continuous effort is also a crucial factor.",
            "etymology": "「才能」 (sainō) meaning 'talent' or 'ability,' is composed of 「才」 (sai) 'talent' and 「能」 (nō) 'ability'. 「努力」 (doryoku) means 'effort' or 'endeavor,' combining 「努」 (do) 'to exert' and 「力」 (ryoku) 'power' or 'strength', indicating the exertion of strength to achieve something. 「欠かさない」 (kakasana nai) means 'never neglects,' derived from 「欠かす」 (kaka su) 'to miss' or 'to neglect'."

The addition of 「よね」 (yo ne) at the end, commonly used by female speakers in casual conversation, softens the assertion and invites confirmation or agreement from the listener, emphasizing shared understanding.",
            "etymology": "「レストラン」 (resutoran) is a loanword from English 'restaurant'. 「料理」 (ryōri) means 'cuisine' or 'dish,' composed of 「料」 (ryō) 'ingredients' or 'materials' and 「理」 (ri) 'reason' or 'arrangement'. 「美味しい」 (oishii) means 'delicious' or 'tasty,' its origin is somewhat debated but it evolved from words meaning 'pleasant to the mouth'."
