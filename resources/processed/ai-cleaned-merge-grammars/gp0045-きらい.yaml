    "etymology": "「嫌い」 comes from the verb 「嫌う」 (kirau), meaning \"to hate\" or \"to dislike\". Over time, it evolved into a な-adjective to describe the state of disliking something, functioning as a descriptive term for feelings of aversion rather than an action. Its usage as a な-adjective, despite ending in い, reflects a historical linguistic development where some verbs transitioned into adjectival forms.",
    "writeup": "「嫌い」 (kirai) expresses a feeling of dislike or aversion. Despite ending in い, it is classified as a な-adjective (adjectival noun) in Japanese, which is an important point for learners to remember as its grammatical behavior differs from i-adjectives. This means it behaves similarly to nouns, requiring 「だ」 or 「です」 when used predicatively, and 「な」 when modifying a noun.\n\nLike other な-adjectives, 「嫌い」 can be used in two primary ways:\n\n*   **Predicative Use:** When used as a predicate, it is followed by 「だ」 (casual) or 「です」 (polite). For example, 「私はピーマンが嫌いです。」 (I dislike green peppers.) In this usage, it asserts that something *is dislikable* or that one *has a dislike* for something.\n\n*   **Attributive Use:** When modifying a noun, it is followed by 「な」. For example, 「嫌いな食べ物」 (disliked food). Here, it describes a quality of the noun, indicating that the noun *is disliked*.\n\n「嫌い」 can be intensified by adding 「大」 (dai) before it, forming 「大嫌い」 (daikirai), which means \"to hate\" or \"to intensely dislike.\" This amplifies the negative feeling, similar to how 「大好き」 (daisuki) amplifies liking to loving.",

To use 「嫌い」, you typically need a subject (the person who dislikes) and an object (what is disliked), whereas 「嫌」 can be used more broadly to describe a situation or one's general feeling about it.",
