    "etymology": "「嫌い」 comes from the verb 「嫌う」 (kirau), meaning \"to hate\" or \"to dislike\". It evolved into a な-adjective to describe the state of disliking something.",
    "writeup": "「嫌い」 (kirai), meaning \"to dislike\", is a common *na*-adjective in Japanese. Remember that *na*-adjectives act as nouns, meaning their forms change depending on what comes after them. \n\nWhen 「嫌い」 acts as an adjective, it is followed by 「な」. When it acts as a noun, it's followed by 「だ」 or the more polite 「です」.\n\nFor example, 「嫌いだ」 expresses that something *is dislikable* while 「嫌いな」 expresses *being disliked* as a quality of the noun it's attached to. Just like 「好き」 can be partnered with 「大」 (dai) to mean \"love,\" 「嫌い」 can be partnered with 「大」 to mean \"hate\" (「大嫌い」).\n\n**Important Note:** Despite ending in い, 「嫌い」 is a *na*-adjective, not an *i*-adjective. This can be confusing for learners, so be mindful of it.",
