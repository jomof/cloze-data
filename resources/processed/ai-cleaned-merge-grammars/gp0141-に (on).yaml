        "particle-syntactic-function": "locative",
        "function": "Indicates the surface of something upon which some action directly takes place.",
        "nuance": "Used to specify the exact point of contact or placement on a surface, emphasizing the location rather than the general area. It signifies that the action is performed directly *on* or *onto* the surface, establishing a clear physical relationship.",
        "colocation": "Commonly used with verbs that imply direct contact or placement, such as 書く (kaku - to write), 置く (oku - to place), 載せる (noseru - to put on), 座る (suwaru - to sit), 立つ (tatsu - to stand), 掛ける (kakeru - to hang), 貼る (haru - to stick), and 積もる (tsumoru - to pile up)."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 originates from the verb 「似る (niru)」, meaning \"to resemble\" or \"to be similar.\" The connection isn't immediately obvious in this usage, but it highlights 「に」's broad function as a marker of direction or destination—something moving *towards* similarity or contact with something else.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」, when indicating location, specifies the surface or exact point *on* which an action occurs. It conveys a sense of direct physical contact or placement. This usage is crucial for precisely locating an action or object on a specific surface.\n\nFor instance, if you are placing an object, 「に」 pinpoints the surface where it lands. If you are sitting, it indicates the specific bench or chair you are sitting on. This distinguishes it from other particles like 「で」, which indicates the general location *where* an action takes place, but not necessarily direct contact with a surface.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n*   **Direct Contact:** Emphasizes that the action or state involves direct touch with a surface.\n*   **Target of Action:** Highlights the surface as the recipient or target of the verb's action.\n*   **Static or Dynamic Verbs:** Can be used with both static verbs (e.g., 座る - to sit, 立つ - to stand, 貼る - to stick) and dynamic verbs (e.g., 置く - to place, 書く - to write, 降る - to fall), as long as direct surface contact is implied.",

For instance, 「いすに座る (isu ni suwaru - to sit *on* a chair)」 denotes direct contact with the chair, while 「部屋で勉強する (heya de benkyousuru - to study *in* the room)」 indicates the room as the broader space for studying. Furthermore, 「に」 can denote a specific destination or point of arrival, whereas 「へ」 focuses solely on the direction of movement.",
