    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 originates from the verb 「似る (niru)」, meaning \"to resemble\" or \"to be similar.\" The connection isn't immediately obvious in this usage, but it highlights 「に」's broad function as a marker of direction or destination—something moving *towards* similarity or contact with something else.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 in this context indicates the surface **on** which an action takes place. Think of it as specifying where something is happening physically. It is used to show direct contact or placement on a surface. Contrast this with 「で」, which indicates the location *where* an action happens, but not necessarily directly on the surface. 「に」 specifies the target or point of contact for an action.",

Also, remember that 「へ」 indicates direction, not location."
