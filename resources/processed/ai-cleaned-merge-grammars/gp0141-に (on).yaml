        "function": "Indicates the surface of something upon which some action directly takes place.",
        "nuance": "Used to specify the exact point of contact or placement on a surface, emphasizing the location rather than the general area. It signifies that the action is performed directly on or onto the surface, establishing a clear physical relationship.",
        "colocation": "Commonly used with verbs that imply direct contact or placement, such as 書く (kaku - to write), 置く (oku - to place), 載せる (noseru - to put on), 座る (suwaru - to sit), 立つ (tatsu - to stand), 掛ける (kakeru - to hang), 貼る (haru - to stick), and 積もる (tsumoru - to pile up)."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 is believed to originate from ancient Japanese, functioning primarily as a general locative and directional marker. Its core meaning relates to pointing towards a specific place, time, or entity. This fundamental concept allows it to indicate a static location (where something is), a destination (where something goes), a time point (when something happens), an indirect object (to whom something is given), or the agent in a passive construction (by whom something is done). All these uses share the common thread of `に` marking a precise 'point' or 'target' in space, time, or relation, establishing a specific connection.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」, when indicating location, specifies the surface or exact point **on** which an action occurs. It conveys a sense of direct physical contact or placement. This usage is crucial for precisely locating an action or object on a specific surface.\n\nFor instance, if you are placing an object, 「に」 pinpoints the surface where it lands. If you are sitting, it indicates the specific bench or chair you are sitting on. This distinguishes it from other particles like 「で」, which indicates the general location *where* an action takes place, but not necessarily direct contact with a surface.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n*   **Direct Contact:** Emphasizes that the action or state involves direct touch with a surface.\n*   **Target of Action:** Highlights the surface as the recipient or target of the verb's action.\n*   **Static or Dynamic Verbs:** Can be used with both static verbs (e.g., 座る - to sit, 立つ - to stand, 貼る - to stick) and dynamic verbs (e.g., 置く - to place, 書く - to write, 降る - to fall), as long as direct surface contact is implied.",

            "meaning": "at, in, by",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「に」, 「で」 indicates the general location *where* an action takes place, focusing on the venue or broader area, rather than the specific surface of contact. For example, 「公園で遊びます (kouen de asobimasu - I play *in* the park)」 indicates playing *within* the park, not necessarily *on* a specific part of it."

            "meaning": "to (a direction)",
            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "「へ」 indicates the direction of movement towards a destination or goal, without specifying the point of arrival or direct contact. 「に」, on the other hand, often marks the precise point of arrival or the surface on which an action occurs. For example, 「学校へ行きます (gakkou e ikimasu - I go *towards* school)」 versus 「学校に着きます (gakkou ni tsukimasu - I arrive *at* school)」."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate between 「に」 and 「で」 when discussing location, consider whether the action involves direct contact or placement *on* a specific surface. If so, 「に」 is appropriate. If the action merely occurs *within* a general area or location, 「で」 is used. For instance, 「いすに座る (isu ni suwaru - to sit *on* a chair)」 denotes direct contact with the chair, while 「部屋で勉強する (heya de benkyousuru - to study *in* the room)」 indicates the room as the broader space for studying. Furthermore, 「に」 can denote a specific destination or point of arrival, whereas 「へ」 focuses solely on the direction of movement.",
