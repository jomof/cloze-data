    "etymology": "The term 「ぐるみ」 stems from the verb 「包む(tsutsumu)」, meaning \"to wrap\" or \"to encompass.\" This etymology suggests the nuance of something being completely enveloped or included.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「ぐるみ」, when following a noun, expresses that something encompasses absolutely all of that noun. It can be translated as \"including (A),\" \"all over (A),\" or \"(A) wide.\"\n\n「ぐるみ」 stems from the verb 「包む」, meaning \"to wrap\" or \"to encompass.\"\n\nIn many cases, the case-marking particle 「で」 will follow 「ぐるみ」 to mark \"with,\" but 「の」 may also be seen when preceding a second noun.\n\n「ぐるみ」 is most frequently seen following words that specify a whole \"group\" or \"span\" to which the topic of the sentence is only one part. This could be one member of a family, one home within a neighborhood, one student within a school, or any other number of things that share a clearly identifiable link.\n\nDespite this, the primary nuance will always be that the group itself shares a common trait, rather than focusing on any individual part.",
