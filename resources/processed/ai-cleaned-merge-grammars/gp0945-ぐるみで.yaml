    "etymology": "The term ぐるみ stems from the verb 包む (tsutsumu), meaning \"to wrap\" or \"to encompass.\" This etymology suggests the nuance of something being completely enveloped or included.",
    "writeup": "The suffix ぐるみ is attached to nouns to express that something encompasses or includes the entirety of that noun, often translating to 'whole,' 'entire,' or 'all of [noun].'\n\nIt is commonly followed by the particle で, indicating 'with' or 'by means of' the entire group. Occasionally, の may follow when ぐるみ modifies another noun directly, such as in 「家族ぐるみのお付き合い」 (family-wide relationship).\n\nThis grammar point is frequently used with nouns that denote a collective entity, such as families (家族), companies (会社), or communities (地域, 街). It implies that the action or state applies to the collective as a whole, rather than just individual components within it.\n\nThe core nuance of ぐるみで emphasizes a unified and comprehensive involvement, highlighting that the group itself shares a common trait or participates in a collective action.",
