        "nuance": "Emphasizes that an action or state applies to the collective as a unified entity, rather than just individual components.",
        "colocation": "Often collocates with nouns denoting collective bodies such as 家族 (family), 会社 (company), 地域 (region), or 街 (town), and idiomatically with 身 (body/self) to mean all one's belongings.",

    "etymology": "The term ぐるみ stems from the verb 包む (tsutsumu), meaning \"to wrap\" or \"to encompass.\" This etymology suggests the nuance of something being completely enveloped or included.",
    "writeup": "The suffix **ぐるみ** is attached to nouns to express that something encompasses or includes the entirety of that noun, often translating to 'whole,' 'entire,' or 'all of [noun].'\n\nIt is commonly followed by the particle **で**, indicating 'with' or 'by means of' the entire group. Occasionally, **の** may follow when **ぐるみ** modifies another noun directly, such as in 「家族ぐるみのお付き合い」 (family-wide relationship).\n\nThis grammar point is frequently used with nouns that denote a collective entity, such as families (家族), companies (会社), or communities (地域, 街). It implies that the action or state applies to the collective as a whole, rather than just individual components within it.\n\nThe core nuance of **ぐるみで** emphasizes a unified and comprehensive involvement, highlighting that the group itself shares a common trait or participates in a collective action.",
