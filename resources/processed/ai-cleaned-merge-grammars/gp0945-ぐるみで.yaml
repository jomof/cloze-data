        "part-of-speech": "suffix",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "function": "Indicates comprehensive involvement or inclusion of a group or entity.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes that an action or state applies to the collective as a unified entity, rather than just individual components.",
        "colocation": "Often collocates with nouns denoting collective bodies such as 家族 (family), 会社 (company), 地域 (region), or 街 (town), and idiomatically with 身 (body/self) to mean all one's belongings.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions adverbially when followed by で or adjectivally when followed by の, describing the scope of an action or state."
    },
    "etymology": "The term ぐるみ stems from the verb 包む (tsutsumu), meaning \"to wrap\" or \"to encompass.\" This etymology suggests the nuance of something being completely enveloped or included.",
    "writeup": "The suffix **ぐるみ** is attached to nouns to express that something encompasses or includes the entirety of that noun, often translating to 'whole,' 'entire,' or 'all of [noun].'\n\nIt is commonly followed by the particle **で**, indicating 'with' or 'by means of' the entire group. Occasionally, **の** may follow when **ぐるみ** modifies another noun directly, such as in 「家族ぐるみのお付き合い」 (family-wide relationship).\n\nThis grammar point is frequently used with nouns that denote a collective entity, such as families (家族), companies (会社), or communities (地域, 街). It implies that the action or state applies to the collective as a whole, rather than just individual components within it.\n\nThe core nuance of **ぐるみで** emphasizes a unified and comprehensive involvement, highlighting that the group itself shares a common trait or participates in a collective action.",

            "meaning": "The whole; entirety; general",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「全体」 generally refers to the whole of something as a sum of its parts. While it can imply comprehensiveness, it lacks the nuance of inherent unity or deep-seated collective action that 「ぐるみ」 conveys."

            "meaning": "All; everything; whole",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「全部」 refers to all items or components of a set. It is more about quantity or completeness of individual parts, whereas 「ぐるみ」 focuses on the collective nature or character of the group acting as one."

            "nuance": "「～中」 indicates a spatial or temporal extent (e.g., throughout the day, all over the world). It describes coverage across a period or area, not the collective internal unity or shared characteristic of a group like 「ぐるみ」."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「全体」, 「全部」, and 「～中」 can all express completeness or inclusivity, 「ぐるみ」 specifically emphasizes a deep, inherent involvement or a unified action by an entire collective. For instance, 「会社ぐるみ」 suggests the company itself, in its very character, is involved, rather than merely stating that 'all parts of the company' (会社全体) are involved, or that 'everything within the company' (会社全部) is included. 「～中」 focuses on spatial or temporal coverage, which is distinct from the collective agency implied by 「ぐるみ」.",
