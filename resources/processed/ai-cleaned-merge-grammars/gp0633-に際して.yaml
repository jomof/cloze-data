        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Primarily used for significant, often formal or public, events and transitions. It implies an anticipation or preparation for the situation.",
        "function": "Indicates the timing or occasion of an event, emphasizing actions taken in preparation for or at the crucial point of that event.",
        "nuance": "Carries a more formal and somewhat weighty nuance compared to similar expressions. It highlights the importance of the event as a critical juncture for action.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions adverbially, modifying the main verb phrase by specifying the temporal context.",
        "logical-flow": "Establishes a cause-and-effect or conditional relationship where the action in the main clause is necessitated by or occurs in anticipation of the situation described by に際して.",
        "temporal-flow": "Refers to a specific point in time or a period immediately preceding a significant event. It is generally used for future or current events, not past completed actions."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に際して」 (ni saishite) is derived from the noun 「際」 (sai, meaning 'occasion' or 'time') combined with the particle 「に」 (ni) and the 「て」 form of the verb 「際する」 (saisuru, meaning 'to come to pass' or 'to meet an occasion'). Historically, 「際」 referred to the boundary or edge of something, evolving to denote a critical juncture or turning point in time. Thus, 「に際して」 literally signifies 'at the edge/juncture of' an event, emphasizing the precise moment or preparatory phase surrounding it.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「に際して」 (ni saishite) signifies \"on the occasion of\" or \"at the time of\" a significant event. It is primarily used in formal contexts, such as official announcements, business communications, or ceremonial speeches. This pattern highlights that the action or decision in the main clause is specifically undertaken in response to or in preparation for the event described by 「に際して」.\n\nIt attaches to nouns directly or to verbs in their dictionary form. It cannot be used with verbs in the past tense, as it focuses on the approaching or current juncture of an event, rather than a past completed action. This distinguishes it from similar expressions like 「際に」, which can refer to past events.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n*   **Formality:** 「に際して」 carries a highly formal and somewhat rigid tone. It is less suitable for casual conversations.\n*   **Emphasis on Preparation/Initiation:** It often implies actions that are necessary or appropriate *before* or *at the very beginning* of a significant event. The emphasis is on the context leading up to or coinciding with the event, rather than merely marking a point in time.\n*   **One-off Events:** While not exclusively, it frequently applies to unique, important, or one-time occurrences, such as launching a new project, entering a new phase of life, or undergoing a major transition.\n\nUnderstanding its nuance of 'being presented with a situation and acting accordingly' is crucial to using 「に際して」 effectively. It frames the event as a defining moment that calls for specific attention or action.",
