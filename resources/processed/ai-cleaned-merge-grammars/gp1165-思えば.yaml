    "writeup": "**思えば (omoeba)** is an adverbial phrase used to express a sense of nostalgia, realization, or regret when reflecting on past experiences. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence to introduce a thought that comes to mind when looking back. It carries a nuance of \"now that I think about it...\" or \"come to think of it...\"",
    "etymology": "The term 「思えば」 comes from the verb 「思う (omou)」, meaning \"to think,\" and the conditional 「-ば (-ba)」 form. Therefore, literally, it means \"if I think,\" implying a reflective process that leads to a realization or a feeling about the past.",
