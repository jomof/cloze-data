        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Often used at the beginning of a sentence or clause to introduce a reflective thought.",
        "function": "Expresses feelings of nostalgia or regret when recollecting past experiences.",
        "nuance": "Adds a sense of realization or discovery upon looking back at past events, indicating the speaker's personal feelings and perspective regarding the past."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「思えば」 comes from the verb 「思う (omou)」, meaning \"to think,\" and the conditional 「-ば (-ba)」 form. Therefore, literally, it means \"if I think,\" implying a reflective process that leads to a realization or a feeling about the past.",
    "writeup": "**思えば (omoeba)** is an adverbial phrase used to express a sense of nostalgia, realization, or regret when reflecting on past experiences. It typically appears at the beginning of a sentence or clause to introduce a thought that comes to mind upon looking back. This phrase carries a nuance of \"now that I think about it...\" or \"come to think of it...\" and often implies a deeper understanding or emotional response that wasn't present at the time the event occurred. It is commonly found in both formal writing and formal speech, lending a thoughtful and reflective tone to the discourse.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene focuses on a feeling of nostalgia and fondness for past experiences, which is better conveyed by 「思えば」 as it implies a deeper, often emotional, reflection rather than just a chronological review using 「振り返ると」."

            ],
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "reflective",
            "nuance": "The use of 「あの頃思えば」 sets a reflective tone, and the phrasing 「毎日が冒険のようだった」 combined with the casual register evokes a strong sense of nostalgia and fondness for past experiences, common in personal reflections."

                    "mitigation": "The scene, with its focus on personal regret and a hypothetical past, encourages the use of 「思えば」 which implies a deeper, often emotional, reflection rather than just logical consideration as 「考えると」 might."

                    "mitigation": "The focus on gaining a new insight or realizing a mistake upon reflection, as indicated by 「避けられたはずだった」, aligns better with the nuance of 「思えば」 which implies this deeper realization, rather than a simple retrospective like 「振り返ると」."
