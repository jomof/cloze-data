    "writeup": "**思えば (omoeba)** is an adverbial phrase used to express a sense of nostalgia, realization, or regret when reflecting on past experiences. It typically appears at the beginning of a sentence or clause to introduce a thought that comes to mind upon looking back. This phrase carries a nuance of \"now that I think about it...\" or \"come to think of it...\" and often implies a deeper understanding or emotional response that wasn't present at the time the event occurred. It is commonly found in both formal writing and formal speech, lending a thoughtful and reflective tone to the discourse.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene, with its focus on personal regret and a hypothetical past, encourages the use of 「思えば」 which implies a deeper, often emotional, reflection rather than just logical consideration as 「考えると」 might."
