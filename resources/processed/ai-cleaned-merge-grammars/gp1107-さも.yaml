        "Function": "To describe the appearance of someone's actions or behavior, often with an implication that the appearance is not entirely genuine."
    },
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「さも」 is not definitively known, but it is believed to be related to the word 「然も (さも)」, which has a similar meaning of \"in that way\" or \"as if it were so.\" It is used to emphasize the way something appears or is perceived.",
    "writeup": "「さも」 is an adverb that means \"as if,\" \"truly,\" or \"really.\" It is used to describe how someone's actions or behavior appear, often with an implication that the appearance is not entirely genuine. It is similar in meaning to 「まるで」 and 「いかにも」, but 「さも」 often carries a stronger sense of exaggeration or pretense.\n\nIt's often used to describe someone who is acting in a way that is not entirely sincere or natural. For instance, if someone is acting as if they are very busy, even though they don't have much to do, you could say 「さも忙しそうにしている」.\n\n「さも」 often precedes adjectives or verbs, emphasizing the characteristic being described. You'll often hear this used with 「～そう」, like 「さも美味しそうに食べる」 (eats as if it were truly delicious).",
