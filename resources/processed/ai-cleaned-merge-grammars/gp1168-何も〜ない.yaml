It often carries a nuance of disagreement or a feeling that someone is doing something without good reason. It is similar to saying \"there's no need to\" or \"it's not necessary to\" in English. This construction is frequently used in casual conversation to express opinions or mild frustrations. However, it can be adapted to polite contexts by conjugating the negative ending, for example, to 「ありません」. Often this is spoken with a falling intonation to clearly express the speaker's feelings.",

This nuance, combined with the casual tone, is often conveyed by younger female speakers in expressive contexts when expressing frustration or disappointment. The second Japanese example makes the 'reason' explicit, enhancing the emphasis on the lack of justification.",

It often follows a fact or statement and implies a contrary result or feeling, which aligns with the speaker's frustration over the unresolved conflict."
