    "etymology": "The grammar point 「すくなくない」 is formed by negating the adjective 「少ない(すくない)」, which means \"few\" or \"scarce.\" The addition of 「ない」, meaning \"not,\" creates a double negative, resulting in the meaning \"not few,\" which is equivalent to \"quite a few\" or \"many.\"",
    "writeup": "「少なくない」 is used to indicate that there is a considerable number or amount of something. It is essentially a double negative, where 「少ない」 (few) is negated by 「ない」, resulting in \"not few,\" which translates to \"quite a few\" or \"many.\" This expression is useful when you want to convey that something is more numerous or abundant than one might expect. The expression is fairly neutral and doesn't carry any strong emotional connotation. Remember that the 「ない」 in 「少ない」 is part of the い-adjective and not a separate negative conjugation. Other forms of the adjective can be used, such as 「少なくありません」 in more polite speech or 「少なくなかった」 to talk about the past.",
