    "etymology": "The grammar point 「すくなくない」 is formed by negating the adjective 「少ない (すくない)」, which means \"few\" or \"scarce.\" The addition of 「ない」, meaning \"not,\" creates a double negative, resulting in the meaning \"not few,\" which is equivalent to \"quite a few\" or \"many.\"",
    "writeup": "「少なくない」 is used to indicate that there is a considerable number or amount of something. It is essentially a double negative, where 「少ない」 (few) is negated by 「ない」, resulting in \"not few,\" which translates to \"quite a few\" or \"many.\" This expression is useful when you want to convey that something is more numerous or abundant than one might expect. The expression is fairly neutral and doesn't carry any strong emotional connotation. Remember that the 「ない」 in 「少ない」 is part of the い-adjective and not a separate negative conjugation. Other forms of the adjective can be used, such as 「少なくありません」 in more polite speech or 「少なくなかった」 to talk about the past.",

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Remember that 「すくなくない」 is the opposite of 「すくない」. It can be confusing because of the double negative. Consider 「すくなくない」 to mean that the number or amount is considerable, while 「すくない」 means it is limited or scarce. Think of 「少し」 as indicating a small portion, which is related to 「すくない」 but used in different contexts.",

            "conjugation": "dictionary (plain non-past)",
            "nuance": "The use of 「少なくない」 emphasizes that the number of people is not merely 'many' but a noteworthy or considerable amount, indicating a trend that might be surprising or significant. This nuance is stronger than simply stating 「多い」 (many).",
            "etymology": "The etymology of 「少ない」 (sukunai) itself is ancient, tracing back to Old Japanese. The negative form 「すくなくない」 functions as a double negative, transforming 'not few' into 'many' or 'quite a lot', reflecting a common linguistic phenomenon seen across various languages where negating a negative implies a positive of a significant degree."

            "nuance": "In a professional context, 「少なくありません」 conveys that the presence of overseas employees is not just numerous, but substantial and noteworthy, possibly indicating a diverse work environment or a specific hiring trend. This is more nuanced than a simple statement of quantity.",
            "etymology": "The polite negation 「～ありません」 is a later development in Japanese, evolving from earlier forms. Its use here in 「少なくありません」 highlights formality and respect in a business setting, while still conveying the core meaning of 'quite a few'."

            "etymology": "「だろう」 is a contraction of 「であろう」, expressing probability or conjecture. Its combination with 「少なくない」 forms a nuanced prediction that is more impactful than simply stating 「多いだろう」 (it will probably be many)."

            "nuance": "The use of 「少なくない」 here expresses a reflective observation that the number of children unfamiliar with traditional games is substantial, possibly indicating a cultural shift or a loss of traditional knowledge. It conveys a subtle concern or observation, not just a numerical fact.",
            "etymology": "The particle 「も」 (mo) adds the nuance of 'also' or 'too', indicating that this group of children is another instance among existing observations. This phrase structure has been common in Japanese for centuries to express inclusive observations."

            "nuance": "「少なくなかった」 highlights the considerable and unfortunate impact of the accident, emphasizing that the number of injured people was significant, not merely 'many'. It conveys a sense of gravity befitting the serious topic.",
            "etymology": "The plain past negative form 「～なかった」 is a fundamental aspect of Japanese verb and adjective conjugation, directly descended from older forms. The expression 「～と聞いて いる」 (I hear that...) is a common way to convey hearsay or information received indirectly."

            "etymology": "The polite past negative form 「～ありませんでした」 is a relatively modern development for expressing politeness in past tense negation, contrasting with older, more direct forms. This polite form is widely used in formal discussions and media reports."

            "nuance": "The use of 「なんて」 expresses a sense of surprise or dismay, often indicating concern. The speaker's question, 「うち の 会社 は 大丈夫 か？」 (Is our company okay?), is a common way for male employees to express worry about their workplace's sustainability in a casual setting. The phrase 「少なくない なんて」 expresses strong dismay that a significant number of people are still working late.",
            "etymology": "The particle 「なんて」 is a colloquial contraction of 「などと」 or 「とは」, used to express surprise, contempt, or dismay. Its usage with 「少なくない」 amplifies the speaker's emotional reaction to the situation."

The phrase 「女性 が 少なくない」 highlights a noticeable and significant number of women actively participating in online discussions, conveying a shared observation.",
            "etymology": "The sentence-final particle 「わ」 has historical roots in expressing assertion or emphasis, but over time, especially among women, it evolved to convey a softer, more reflective, or emotional tone. 「ね」 adds a seeking of agreement. Together, 「わね」 creates a gentle, engaging conversational style."

The grammar point highlights that despite being a game, there are a considerable number of beginner-friendly stages, making it enjoyable for less experienced players. 「少なくない」 implies this accessibility is a significant selling point.",
            "etymology": "The particle 「よ」 has ancient origins, primarily functioning as a strong declarative or emphatic particle. In modern casual speech, especially among younger speakers, it is used to draw the listener's attention or emphasize information, making the statement more assertive or persuasive."
