    "etymology": "The kanji 「如」 itself carries the meaning of \"likeness\" or \"resemblance.\" It's found in words like 「如何」(いかが, how) and highlights something that is similar to, but not the same as, another thing. 「如し」 is an older auxiliary verb, predating modern equivalents like 「よう」.",
    "writeup": "「如し」 is a classical auxiliary verb in Japanese, similar in meaning to the modern 「よう」 (manner of). Like 「よう」, 「ごとし」 emphasizes the appearance of something (A) based on observation. Thus, 「ごとし」 can be translated as \"like (A),\" \"similar to (A),\" or \"as if it were (A).\" 「ごとし」 is the base form, but you'll also see 「ごとく」 (the conjunctive form) and 「ごとき」 (the attributive form). Only 「ごとき」 can directly precede nouns, while 「ごとし」 usually ends sentences. 「ごとく」 acts as an adverb before verbs but can also appear before clause breaks.\n\nLike 「よう」, 「ごとし」 and its variations follow 「の」 after nouns and 「が」 after verbs.\n\nAs 「ごとし」 is old-fashioned, it's more common in books than in speech. It is primarily used in formal writing, academic contexts, or to add a sense of classical elegance.",
