    "etymology": "The kanji 「如」 itself means 'like' or 'as'. The forms 「如く」, 「如き」, and 「如し」 are derived from classical Japanese and retain a formal, literary flavor. 「如し」 is the base form, 「如く」 is adverbial, and 「如き」 is adjectival.",
    "writeup": "「如く・如き・如し」 are classical auxiliary verbs that, similar to the modern Japanese 「よう」, express similarity or metaphor. They are highly formal and literary, primarily used in written language rather than daily conversation. Due to their archaic nature, they are rarely used in modern everyday speech, appearing mainly in classical literature, formal speeches, or fixed idiomatic expressions.\n\nThese forms have different grammatical functions:\n*   **如し** (`gotoshi`): This is the terminal form (終止形), functioning as a predicate at the end of a sentence.\n*   **如く** (`gotoku`): This is the adverbial form (連用形), modifying verbs or connecting clauses, serving an adverbial role.\n*   **如き** (`gotoki`): This is the attributive form (連体形), directly preceding and modifying nouns.\n\nSimilar to 「よう」, when following a noun, the particle 「の」 is placed before it. When following a verb, it is connected with the particle 「が」. The kanji 「如」 itself carries the meaning of 'like' or 'as', indicating something that is essentially similar but not identical. This characteristic can also be seen in common Japanese words like 「如何」 (いかが, 'how').",
