grammar_point: どちら様 (very polite who)
learn_before:
  - '[Verb-て]からでないと〜ない (unless after doing)'
  - こちら (this way, formal)
  - ご (honorific prefix for Sino-Japanese words)
id: gp9999
meaning: Who (very polite way to ask for someone's name or identity)
pronunciation:
  katakana: ドチラサマ
  romaji: dochirasama
formation:
  どちら + 様: Used when politely inquiring about someone's identity, especially when they are unknown to
    the speaker, or when taking a phone call.
jlpt: N2
etymology: 「どちら」 originally meant 'which direction' or 'which of two,' and later extended to refer to
  'which person' (polite form of 'どれ'). The addition of the honorific suffix 「様」 (sama), which denotes
  extreme respect or formality, elevates the politeness level significantly, making it a very formal and
  deferential way to ask 'who.'
writeup: |-
  「どちら様」 is a highly polite and formal expression used to inquire about someone's identity. It literally translates to something like 'Which honorable person?' and is commonly employed in situations where you do not know the person you are speaking with, or when you are answering a phone call and need to identify the caller. It conveys a strong sense of respect and humility from the speaker. It is more formal than 「どなた」 and much more polite than the casual 「誰」.

  This expression is particularly prevalent in business contexts, customer service, and reception settings, where maintaining a respectful and polite demeanor is crucial. For example, a receptionist might use it when a visitor arrives, or a shop assistant might use it with an unfamiliar customer. On the phone, it is the standard way to ask 'who is calling?' if the caller does not immediately introduce themselves.

  While highly polite, its use implies a certain distance or lack of familiarity. It would generally not be used with close friends or family, nor would it be used if you already know the person but simply forgot their name (in which case a more direct and apologetic approach might be taken).

  - term: 誰 (who)
    meaning: Who (casual)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「誰」 is the most basic and casual way to ask 'who.' It lacks any politeness or formality and
      should only be used in very informal settings or with close acquaintances. It can sound rude in
      formal contexts. We're looking for a very polite way to ask 'who.'
    grammar_point: 誰 (who)
  - term: どなた (polite who)
    meaning: Who (polite)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どなた」 is polite and suitable for many formal situations, but 「どちら様」 adds an extra layer of
      deference and formality, often implying a greater distance or humility on the part of the speaker.
      Use 「どなた」 when politeness is required, but 「どちら様」 for utmost politeness or when directly identifying
      an unknown party.
    grammar_point: どなた (polite who)
  - term: どちら (which way・person)
    meaning: Which (of two or more); which way; who (polite)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どちら」 itself can be used to politely ask 'who' when referring to one of two or more options,
      or simply as a polite 'who' (e.g., in 'どちら様', it's the base word). However, without 「様」, it lacks
      the strong deferential nuance specific to identifying an unknown person in a very formal context.
      We're looking for the specific phrase 「どちら様」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どちら (this way・that way・which way, formal)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the subtle differences among 「誰」, 「どなた」, and 「どちら様」 is key to
  speaking Japanese appropriately for the situation. While all translate to 'who' in English, their levels
  of politeness and contexts of use vary significantly. 「誰」 is informal, 「どなた」 is generally polite, and
  「どちら様」 is reserved for highly formal or deferential inquiries, particularly when the person's identity
  is completely unknown or they are a guest/client.

          - お 電話 ありがとう ござい ます。誰 です か。
        english: Thank you for your call. Who is it?
        hint: Using 「誰 ですか」 on the phone sounds very impolite, almost accusatory, especially in a professional
          setting. We're looking for a very polite way to ask 'who'.

          - お 電話 ありがとう ござい ます。どなた です か。
        english: Thank you for your call. Who is it? (polite)
        hint: While 「どなた ですか」 is polite, 「どちら様 で いらっしゃいますか」 conveys an even higher degree of politeness
          and is more standard for identifying callers in a business context. We're looking for a very
          polite way to ask 'who'.

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「どちら様」 is primarily used in formal or semi-formal settings,
  particularly when identifying an unknown individual in professional contexts or when answering the phone.
  The nuances conveyed include respect, humility, and a certain degree of distance, which are all critical
  aspects of Japanese communication culture. Pay close attention to the particles and verbs used with
  「どちら様」, such as 「で いらっしゃいますか」 or 「で ございましょうか」, as these further enhance the politeness and formality
  of the expression.
