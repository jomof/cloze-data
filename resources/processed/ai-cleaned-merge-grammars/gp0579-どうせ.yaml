        "どうせ + [statement about an inevitable outcome]": "Expresses the speaker's feeling that a certain outcome is unavoidable, regardless of actions taken."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar structure 「どうせ」 comes from a combination of 「どう」 (how) and the imperative form of 「する」, which is 「せよ」. In this way, it emphasizes that no matter \"how\" something is done, the result cannot be changed.",
    "writeup": "「どうせ」 is an adverb used in Japanese to express that a particular state or condition (A) will result in (B). Usually, there is no way to stop (B) from happening, and it is considered a natural consequence of (A). In English, this translates closely with phrases like \"at any rate\" or \"in any case.\"\n\nBeing an adverb, 「どうせ」 most often appears at the beginning of sentences, before going on to describe the inevitable situation. 「どうせ」 often carries a nuance of frustration or resignation that (A) cannot be changed. In these cases, it is often paired with other grammar structures such as 「なら」 or 「だから」. This shows that if (A) cannot be changed, then (B) is a good idea. This usage translates similarly to \"if (A), you might as well (B).\"",

            "setting": "casual",

            "speaker_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "「～んでしょ」is a colloquial way to express assumption. Because the speaker is female, it's possible she might end the sentence with 「～の」, but it isn't present here. The tone is somewhat despairing, assuming the listener doesn't like them.",
            "etymology": "「なんて」 is used to emphasize the insignificance of the speaker in the listener's eyes."

            "nuance": "「～に決まっている」 expresses a strong conviction or certainty about a future outcome, adding emphasis to the inevitability conveyed by 「どうせ」.",
