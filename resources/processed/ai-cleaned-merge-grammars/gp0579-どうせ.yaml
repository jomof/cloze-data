        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "expresses inevitability or resignation",
        "nuance": "Often carries a nuance of frustration, pessimism, or resignation, implying that efforts to change the outcome would be futile. It can also suggest 'might as well' if paired with conditional structures.",
        "source": "Bunpro, DOJG",
        "grammatical-role": "adverb",
        "logical-flow": "implies a predetermined or unavoidable outcome, often leading to a conclusion or a 'might as well' suggestion",

        "spatial-flow": "N/A"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar structure 「どうせ」 comes from a combination of 「どう」 (how) and the imperative form of 「する」, which is 「せよ」. In this way, it emphasizes that no matter \"how\" something is done, the result cannot be changed, conveying a sense of futility or inevitability.",
    "writeup": "「どうせ」 is an adverb used in Japanese to express that a particular state or condition (A) will result in (B). Usually, there is no way to stop (B) from happening, and it is considered a natural consequence of (A). In English, this translates closely with phrases like \"at any rate\" or \"in any case.\"\n\nBeing an adverb, 「どうせ」 most often appears at the beginning of sentences, before going on to describe the inevitable situation. 「どうせ」 often carries a nuance of frustration or resignation that (A) cannot be changed. In these cases, it is often paired with other grammar structures such as 「なら」 or 「だから」. This shows that if (A) cannot be changed, then (B) is a good idea. This usage translates similarly to \"if (A), you might as well (B).\"",

            "nuance": "「どうせ」 emphasizes a deep-seated feeling of inevitability regarding one's own perceived insignificance. The addition of 「なんて」 after 「私」 (わたし) further amplifies this self-deprecating sentiment, suggesting that the speaker views themselves as unworthy of attention."
