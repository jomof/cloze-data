    "etymology": "The word 「自分 (jibun)」 is derived from 「自 (ji)」 meaning 'self' and 「分 (bun)」 which originally meant 'to divide' or 'a part'. Over time, it evolved to represent one's own portion or self. The independent action connotation comes from the reflexive nature of referring back to the subject performing the action.",
    "writeup": "**自分 (jibun)** is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of a sentence, similar to \"oneself\" or \"myself/yourself/himself/herself/themselves\" in English. It implies a contrast or emphasis on the individual's own actions or possessions. 「自分」 can also indicate doing something independently or voluntarily. It is a fundamental word that shows a clear distinction between the speaker's own self or actions and those of others. This usage of 「自分」 emphasizes an action being performed by the subject *personally* rather than by or for someone else, or a possession being *exclusively* one's own.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "「自分」は日本語において、英語の\"self\"に対応する非常に多義的な表現です。この文法点で扱っている「自分」は、主語が他人とは異なる独立した行動をとる、あるいは他者とは区別される「自分自身のもの」であるという強調を伴います。対して、単に主語を指す一般的な再帰代名詞としての「自分」もあります。両者の違いは、文脈における「対比」や「独立性」の有無にあります。前者はその対比を強く意識する場面で用いられ、後者は単に自己を指す場合に用いられます。",
