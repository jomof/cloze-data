    "etymology": "The word 「自分 (jibun)」 is derived from 「自 (ji)」 meaning 'self' and 「分 (bun)」 which originally meant 'to divide' or 'a part'. Over time, it evolved to represent one's own portion or self. The independent action connotation comes from the reflexive nature of referring back to the subject performing the action.",

It implies a contrast or emphasis on the individual's own actions or possessions. 「自分」 can also indicate doing something independently or voluntarily.",
