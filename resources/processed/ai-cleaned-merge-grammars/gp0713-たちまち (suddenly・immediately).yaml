    "etymology": "The word 「たちまち」 originally comes from the kanji structure 「忽ち」, with the kanji itself meaning 'without thought'. This nuance is kept with 「たちまち」, as all actions associated with the word indicate a lack of planning or thought before happening. Despite this, the kanji itself is rarely used in modern writing.",
    "writeup": "「たちまち」 is an adverb used to convey the feeling of something happening 'suddenly' or 'in a flash'. The primary nuance with 「たちまち」, compared to other similar structures, is that it indicates something happened spontaneously and was not able to be controlled. In many cases, 「たちまち」 will indicate something entering a new, ongoing state, or something being completed. It often appears directly before the verb phrase it describes as being the new state. Historically, 「たちまち」 originates from the kanji 「忽ち」 (忽 meaning 'without thought'). This etymology reinforces the nuance of spontaneity, as actions described by 「たちまち」 are often unplanned or occur without conscious effort. While the kanji itself is rarely seen in contemporary writing, its underlying meaning persists in the adverb's usage.",
