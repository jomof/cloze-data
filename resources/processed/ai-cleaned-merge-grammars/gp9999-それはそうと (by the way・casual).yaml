jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  function: To introduce a new topic, often unrelated to the previous one, in a casual conversation.
  nuance: It suggests acknowledging the previous statement but signaling a shift in focus. It's less abrupt
    than just starting a new topic.
etymology: The phrase 「それはそうと」 literally translates to "That is so, but..." or "That being the case, however...".
  It is a contraction of 「それはそうとして」 or 「それはそうだが」, meaning "leaving that aside" or "although that is true".
  Over time, its usage evolved to signal a transition to a new topic, implying that the previous subject
  is acknowledged but the speaker wishes to move on. This etymology highlights its function as a bridge
  between conversational segments.
writeup: 「それはそうと」 is a very common and useful conversational phrase in Japanese that functions similarly
  to "by the way" or "incidentally" in English. It is used to smoothly change the topic of conversation,
  often when the new topic is unrelated to the previous one. While it acknowledges what was just said,
  it signals the speaker's intention to shift the focus to something new. This phrase is generally considered
  casual and is most frequently heard in informal settings among friends, family, or close acquaintances.
  It helps to maintain a natural flow in conversation, avoiding an abrupt or rude change of subject. It
  is rarely used in formal or business contexts, where other transitional phrases like 「さて」 or 「ところで」
  might be more appropriate, depending on the specific nuance and formality required.
false_friends:
  - term: ところで (by the way)
    meaning: by the way; incidentally; now
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ところで」 is generally more formal or used for a more significant topic change, or to bring up
      something that was meant to be mentioned earlier. 「それはそうと」 is typically for more casual, sometimes
      tangential, topic shifts.
    grammar_point: ところで (by the way)
  - term: ちなみに (by the way)
    meaning: incidentally; by the way; for your information
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ちなみに」 is used to add supplementary or additional information to the current topic, rather
      than completely changing it. It's like saying "in passing" or "for your reference." 「それはそうと」 marks
      a genuine topic shift.
    grammar_point: ちなみに (by the way)
  - term: さて (transitional word)
    meaning: now; well; anyway
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「さて」 is a more formal and generally broader transitional word, often used to move from one
      phase of an activity to another, or to formally introduce a new section in a speech or meeting.
      It doesn't carry the "by the way" nuance of changing a conversational topic casually.
    grammar_point: さて (transitional word)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「それはそうと」, 「ところで」, 「ちなみに」, and 「さて」 all serve to transition speech, their
  nuances differ significantly. 「それはそうと」 is specifically for casual, often abrupt, topic changes. 「ところで」
  is similar but often implies a slightly more substantial or premeditated topic shift, and can be used
  in slightly more formal contexts. 「ちなみに」 is for adding related but supplementary information. 「さて」 is
  a broader, more formal transitional word used to signal the beginning of a new phase or section. Choose
  wisely based on the context and desired formality.
