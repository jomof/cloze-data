    "etymology": "The grammar point 「につれて」 is derived from the verb 「連れる (つれる)」, meaning \"to lead, to take along\". The 「に」 particle indicates direction or purpose. The 「て」 form connects the two clauses, suggesting that the second event occurs in tow with the first. Thus, literally, it implies that the second event is being 'taken along with' the first, indicating a simultaneous change or progression.",
    "writeup": "「につれて」 indicates that as one event happens, another event happens in proportion or simultaneously. Think of it as one thing \"leading\" to another. It describes a relationship where the degree of one event influences the degree of another, often implying a **'domino effect'** where the first event instigates a simultaneous change in the second. 「につれて」 follows the plain, non-past form of a verb or a noun.",

                    "mitigation": "While 「ば～ほど」 emphasizes direct proportionality, 「につれて」 better captures the idea of one thing progressing along with another, which is more natural for gradual improvement and growth of friendships. The scene emphasizes the journey rather than just the degree."
