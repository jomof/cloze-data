    "etymology": "The grammar point 「につれて」 is derived from the verb 「連れる (つれる)」, meaning \"to lead, to take along\". The 「に」 particle indicates direction or purpose. The 「て」 form connects the two clauses, suggesting that the second event occurs in tow with the first. Thus, literally, it implies that the second event is being 'taken along with' the first, indicating a simultaneous change or progression.",
    "writeup": "「につれて」 indicates that as one event happens, another event happens in proportion or simultaneously. Think of it as one thing \"leading\" to another. It's used to describe a relationship where the degree of one event influences the degree of another. 「につれて」 follows the plain, non-past form of a verb or a noun.",

This is a common and natural progression, making it a suitable use of 「につれて」. The formal register suggests a conversation with an older mentor or teacher.",
