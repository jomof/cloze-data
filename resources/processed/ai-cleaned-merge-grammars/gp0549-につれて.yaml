    "etymology": "The grammar point 「につれて」 is derived from the verb 「連れる (つれる)」, meaning \"to lead, to take along\". The 「に」 particle indicates direction or purpose. The 「て」 form connects the two clauses, suggesting that the second event occurs in tow with the first. Thus, literally, it implies that the second event is being 'taken along with' the first, indicating a simultaneous change or progression.",
    "writeup": "「につれて」 indicates that as one event happens, another event happens in proportion or simultaneously. Think of it as one thing \"leading\" to another. It's used to describe a relationship where the degree of one event influences the degree of another. 「につれて」 follows the plain, non-past form of a verb or a noun.",

                    "competing_grammar": "日本語が上手になればなるほど、日本人の友達が増えました。",
                    "mitigation": "While 「ば～ほど」 emphasizes direct proportionality, 「につれて」 better captures the idea of one thing progressing along with another, which is more natural for gradual improvement and growth of friendships. The scene emphasizes the journey rather than just the degree."
