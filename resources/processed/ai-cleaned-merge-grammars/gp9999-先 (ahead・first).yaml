etymology: The kanji 先 literally means "ahead" or "previous." It encompasses notions of spatial front,
  temporal precedence, and the leading edge or tip of something. Its broad application stems from this
  core idea of being 'before' or 'at the forefront' in various contexts, evolving to describe everything
  from physical points to chronological order or future prospects.
writeup: |-
  先 (さき) is a versatile noun in Japanese that conveys a range of meanings related to position, time, and direction. At its core, 先 indicates something that is "ahead," "in front," or "previous." This can be understood in several ways:

  1.  **Spatial Ahead/Front**: It refers to a location that is forward or further along. For example, 「道の 先」 (michi no saki) means "the end of the road" or "further down the road." It can also mean the "tip" or "end" of an object, like 「指の 先」 (yubi no saki) for "fingertip."
  2.  **Temporal Prior/Future**: 先 can denote something that happened "before" or will happen in the "future." 「先 ほど」 (saki hodo) means "a little while ago," while 「先 のこと」 (saki no koto) refers to "things in the future." It can also indicate priority, as in "doing something first."
  3.  **Destination/Place**: When combined with a verb, 先 can refer to a destination or place associated with that action. For instance, 「旅行 先」 (ryokōsaki) means "travel destination," and 「仕事 先」 (shigotosaki) means "workplace" or "client site."
  4.  **The Other Party**: In certain contexts, especially in business or polite conversation, 先 can refer to the other person or party one is dealing with, implying "the one ahead" or "the one I'm interacting with." For example, 「お取引 先」 (otorihikisaki) means "business partner" or "client."

  Understanding the fundamental concept of "being before" or "at the leading edge" helps to grasp the various applications of 先. The precise meaning often depends on the particles used with it and the surrounding context.

  - term: 後
    meaning: after, behind
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 後 is the direct opposite of 先 in both temporal and spatial contexts. While 先 refers to what
      comes before or is ahead, 後 refers to what comes after or is behind.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:後 (after・behind)
  - term: 前
    meaning: front, before
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 先 and 前 can mean "before" or "front." However, 前 often refers to an immediate, directly
      observable "front" or "before," whereas 先 can imply a "tip," "further ahead" (like a destination),
      or "previous" in a more general sense. For example, 「駅の 前」 is directly in front of the station,
      while 「道の 先」 is further down the road.

  - term: 行き先
    meaning: destination
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 行き先 is a compound noun specifically meaning "destination" or "the place one is headed." While
      先 can refer to a destination, 行き先 is a more precise and common term when explicitly talking about
      where someone or something is going.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:行き先 (destination)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 先, 前, and 後 all relate to spatial and temporal positioning, their precise
  usage differs. 先 focuses on the 'leading edge' or 'point ahead,' whether physically or chronologically.
  前 is more about the immediate 'front' or 'before.' 後 is the clear opposite, indicating 'behind' or 'after.'
  行き先 is a specialized term for a 'destination,' building on 先's core meaning but with a more specific
  focus.

          or 'things to come' but has a slightly broader nuance, extending to the immediate next steps
          or plans, not just the distant future. We're looking for a slightly more general sense of what's

        english: Tomorrow, I will visit the client's office.
        hint: クライアント (kuraianto) and オフィス (ofisu) are English loanwords. お取引先 (otorihikisaki) is a common,
          polite Japanese term specifically for a business client or partner's location. We're looking
          for the standard respectful term in Japanese business context.
    scene: A business meeting where team members are discussing their schedule for the next day.
    register: kenjōgo (humble)
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「お取引先」 is a key term in Japanese business etiquette, referring to a business partner or client
      with respect. 「伺います」 is the humble form of 行きます (to go) or 訪ねます (to visit), reinforcing the humble
      register appropriate when speaking about one's actions to a superior or client.

        hint: まず (mazu) means 'first' in the sense of 'initially' or 'to begin with.' 先 に (saki ni) can
          also mean 'first,' but often implies 'before other things' or 'ahead of schedule/others,' emphasizing
          priority in sequence. We're looking for prioritizing this action among others.

        english: From now, let's be more careful.
        hint: これ から (kore kara) means 'from now.' Adding 先 emphasizes the forward movement in time, meaning
          'from this point onward into the future,' making the statement stronger and more definitive.
          We're looking for that stronger emphasis.
    scene: A team reflecting on a recent mistake and resolving to improve in the future.

    conjugation: volitional polite (～ましょう)
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 先 functions across various contexts, from concrete spatial
  locations like the tip of an object to abstract temporal references and even roles in human interactions.
  Pay close attention to the particles and accompanying verbs, as they often clarify the precise nuance
  of 先 in a given sentence.
