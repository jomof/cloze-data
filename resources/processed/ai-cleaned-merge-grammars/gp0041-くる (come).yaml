jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General
  function: Indicates movement towards the speaker's location or viewpoint, or a specified location relevant
    to the speaker.
  nuance: Can express physical movement, the arrival of something, or even a psychological movement of
    viewpoint. Often used in contrast to 「行く (いく)」, which means 'to go'.
  grammatical-role: Main verb
  temporal-flow: Movement towards a point in time or space.
  spatial-flow: Movement towards a reference point (speaker's location, empathic location). Whenever the
    subject moves towards the speaker or the speaker's viewpoint, 「来る」 is used, regardless of the physical
    distance involved. This psychological viewpoint is key to its usage.
etymology: The verb 「来る (くる)」 has ancient roots in the Japanese language, tracing back to the Old Japanese
  period. Its core meaning has remained largely consistent, always indicating movement towards the speaker
  or a specified location. The kanji 「来」 itself is a pictograph representing a person coming, further
  emphasizing the verb's primary meaning. Its irregular conjugation is a remnant of older linguistic patterns,
  making it one of only two major verbs (along with 「する」) that do not follow standard modern conjugation
  rules.
writeup: |-
  「来る (くる)」 is a fundamental verb meaning "to come." It indicates movement toward the speaker's location, a location relevant to the speaker, or a specific viewpoint the speaker has adopted. Unlike most verbs in Japanese, 「来る」 is an irregular verb (変格活用), specifically a *ka*-column irregular verb (カ変動詞). This means its conjugation patterns deviate significantly from standard *godan* and *ichidan* verbs. The core of its irregularity lies in the fact that the 「る」 at the end of the dictionary form does not conjugate; instead, parts of the stem 「く」 or 「こ」 change depending on the conjugation.

  ### Usage and Context

  *   **Destination**: 「来る」 often appears with particles such as 「に」 or 「へ」 to specify the destination. For example, 「学校 に {来る} (がっこう に くる)」 means "to come to school."
  *   **Means of Transportation**: When describing the means of transportation, use the particle 「で」. For example, 「バス で {来る} (バス で くる)」 means "to come by bus."
  *   **Viewpoint and Empathy**: A crucial aspect of 「来る」 is its use in relation to the speaker's viewpoint or area of empathy. Even if the speaker is not physically present at the destination, if they view that location as their 'territory' or feel strong empathy for it, 「来る」 can be used. For instance, if you are inviting someone to a party you are hosting, you would use 「来る」 (e.g., 「パーティー に {来る}？」 - "Will you come to the party?"), even if you are not physically at the party location when inviting them.

  ### Special Case: 「来ている (きている)」

  The 「～ている」 form of 「来る」, 「来ている」, can have two distinct meanings:

  1.  **Progressive Action**: "to be coming" (i.e., currently in the process of moving towards the location).
  2.  **Resulting State**: "to have come and be present" (i.e., already arrived and currently at the location).

  The specific meaning often depends on the context. For example, if you are on the phone with someone who is on their way, 「今 、 そちら に {来ている}」 would mean "I am coming to your place now." However, if someone asks if a guest has arrived, 「お客様 が {来ている}」 would mean "The guest has arrived and is here." It's important to note that when 「来ている」 refers to a resulting state of being present, it typically applies to places one has *temporarily* come to, rather than permanent residences like one's own home or workplace. For those, 「いる (to be/exist)」 is usually used.
false_friends:
  - term: 行く
    meaning: To go to, To head toward
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「来る」, which indicates movement towards the speaker or a designated viewpoint, 「行く」
      indicates movement away from the speaker or towards a different location. Consider the relative
      position of the speaker to the destination when choosing between them. For example, if you are at
      home and your friend is coming over, you use 「来る」. If you are going to your friend's house, you
      use 「行く」. The direction of movement is key here, relative to the speaker or a shared reference point,
      which can be psychological as well as physical. 「行く」 is the general verb for 'to go'.
    grammar_point: 行く (to go)
  - term: てくる
    meaning: To come to, To become, To continue, To be starting to, Has been ~ing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～てくる」 indicates a gradual change or a continuous action over time, often implying an action
      performed in the past and continuing to the present or an action that results in a state, whereas
      「来る」 as a standalone verb simply denotes arriving or coming to a place. While 「～てくる」 uses the verb
      「来る」, its grammatical function as a compound verb or auxiliary verb differs significantly from 「来る」
      as a standalone verb of motion. For instance, 「暖かく なって きた」 means 'it has become warm', indicating
      a change, not physical movement. 「走って くる」 means 'to come running', focusing on the manner of coming.
      Its primary meaning is not just 'to come'.
    grammar_point: Vて + くる (gradual change or continuation)
  - term: いらっしゃる
    meaning: To be (Honorific), To come (Honorific), To go (Honorific)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「いらっしゃる」 is a more polite or honorific form of 「来る」 (and also 「いる」 and 「行く」), used when speaking
      about superiors or elders to show respect. Choose 「いらっしゃる」 when the subject is someone of higher
      status, such as a teacher, boss, or honored guest. It elevates the status of the person performing
      the action, making it suitable for formal situations or when showing deference. It replaces the
      plain verb entirely, rather than modifying it. Its usage implies a higher level of respect than
      simply using the polite 「来ます」.
    grammar_point: いらっしゃる (honorific forms)
  - term: 帰る
    meaning: To return, to go/come home
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「帰る」 specifically denotes returning to a place considered one's base or home (e.g., one's
      house, company, or country). While it can be translated as 'come home' (implying movement toward
      the speaker's location if the speaker is at home), it fundamentally carries the nuance of *returning*
      rather than simply *coming* or *going*. This makes it distinct from 「来る」, which is about general
      movement towards a reference point, and 「行く」, which is about general movement away.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:帰る (to return)
  - term: 訪れる
    meaning: To visit; to call on; to arrive (e.g., season, opportunity)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「訪れる」 is more specific than 「来る」, implying a *visit* with a purpose or an *arrival* of a non-physical
      entity like a season or opportunity. It is often used in more formal or literary contexts. While
      a visit involves "coming," 「来る」 is simply about movement, while 「訪れる」 emphasizes the act of visiting
      a specific place or person, or a significant arrival.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:訪れる (to visit)
  - term: 現れる
    meaning: To appear; to emerge; to show up
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '「現れる」 focuses on something becoming visible or manifesting, often suddenly or unexpectedly.
      It does not necessarily imply deliberate movement from one point to another in the same way 「来る」
      does. While someone "showing up" (現れる) means they "came" (来る), the emphasis is different: 「来る」 emphasizes
      the act of moving towards, while 「現れる」 emphasizes the act of becoming visible.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:現れる (to appear)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「行く」 focuses on movement away from the speaker,
  while 「～てくる」 is about a change or ongoing action. 「いらっしゃる」 adds a layer of politeness or respect when
  referring to someone of higher status. 「帰る」 specifically means to return to one's base, distinct from
  general 'coming' or 'going'. 「訪れる」 implies a purposeful visit or a more significant, often non-physical,
  arrival, while 「現れる」 emphasizes an unexpected appearance rather than directed movement. Consider the
  direction of movement, the level of formality, and the specific nature of the arrival when choosing
  between these expressions.

          - 明日、友達 が うち に {行く} 予定 です。
        english: My friend is scheduled to go to my house tomorrow.
        hint: The scene specifies that the speaker is at 'my house' (うち), making the friend's movement
          an act of 'coming' towards the speaker's current location, rather much like 'going' somewhere
          from an outside perspective.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日、友達 が うち に {いらっしゃる} 予定 です。
        english: My friend is scheduled to come to my house tomorrow (honorific).

          - 明日、友達 が うち に {帰る} 予定 です。
        english: My friend is scheduled to return home tomorrow.
        hint: 「帰る」 means to return to one's home or base. While your friend is coming to your house, the
          focus here is on their arrival rather than their return journey. We're looking for a general
          arrival at your house.
    scene: A man telling his roommate about a visitor for the next day. The speaker is at the house.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The plain form 「来る」 is casual and fits a conversation between roommates. The use of 「うち に
      来る」 naturally implies movement towards the speaker's immediate personal space, even if the speaker
      isn't physically there at the moment of utterance, they identify 'うち' as their location. This context
      is suitable for a casual male speaker, suggesting comfort and familiarity between roommates where
      directness is accepted.

        english: My father went by car.

    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Using 「来た」 here confirms the father's arrival at the shared home (the speaker's implied location).
      The use of the plain past form 「来た」 is typical in casual conversation within a family.
  - english: I came to buy some books.
    japanese:

      - competing_japanese:
          - 本 を 買い に {行っ た}。
        english: I went to buy some books.
        hint: 「来た」 implies you returned to your current location after buying the books or that you are
          still at the location where you came to buy them. 「行った」 means you went somewhere else and bought
          them.
    scene: Someone explaining their reason for being at a bookstore.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The 「～に 来る」 construction is common for expressing purpose. 「買い に 来た」 directly states the reason
      for the speaker's arrival at the current location or return. It's a direct and natural way to explain
      one's presence.
  - english: The mail comes every morning.
    japanese:
      - 郵便 は 毎朝 {来る}。
      - 郵便 は 毎朝 {来 ます}。
    english_literally: Mail, every morning, comes.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 郵便 は 毎朝 {届く}。
        english: The mail arrives every morning.
        hint: While 「届く」 (to arrive/be delivered) is also possible for mail, 「来る」 emphasizes the regularity
          of its arrival to the speaker's location, making it feel more personal and routine.
    scene: A general observation about daily routine.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: Using 「来る」 for mail, like 「郵便 が 来る」, personifies the mail slightly, making it feel as if it
      deliberately 'comes' to you. It's a very common and natural way to describe routine arrivals. The
      plain form suits a general, factual statement.
  - english: Please come here.
    japanese:
      - こちら へ {来 なさい}。
      - こちら へ {来 て ください}。
      - こちら へ {来い}！
    english_literally: Here to, come please.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - こちら へ {お いで なさい}。
        english: Please come here (more polite).
        hint: 「おいでなさい」 is another polite imperative, often used by women or towards children in a gentler
          way than 「来なさい」. We're looking for the direct 「来なさい」.
    scene: A teacher asking a student to approach the desk.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: imperative polite (～なさい)
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「来なさい」 is a common polite imperative, often used by parents, teachers, or superiors toward
      those younger or of lower status. It conveys a clear instruction without being overly harsh, especially
      when spoken by an older speaker. Adding 「来て ください」 provides a more generally polite request, while
      「来い！」 offers a very direct, strong command, often used by men or in urgent situations, showing the
      range of direct instructions involving 'to come'.
  - english: Would you please come to the meeting?
    japanese:
      - 会議 に {来 て} いただけ ませ ん か。
      - 会議 に {来 て もらえ ませ ん か}。
    english_literally: Meeting to, coming receive, cannot you?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 に お {越し} いただけ ませ ん か。
        english: Would you please come to the meeting? (honorific)
        hint: 「お越しいただく」 is a more formal and honorific way to ask someone to come, using the noun 「越し」
          from the verb 「越す」 (to cross/pass) and the honorific auxiliary 「お～いただく」. The original sentence
          uses the standard polite form of 「来る」.
    scene: A manager asking an important client to attend a meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Using the て-form of 「来る」 with 「いただく」 creates a very polite and deferential request, suitable
      for professional settings like inviting a client. 「来ていただけませんか」 expresses the speaker's desire for
      the listener to perform the action, benefiting the speaker. The added 「来て もらえ ませんか」 is slightly
      less formal but still highly polite, conveying a request for a favor.
  - english: Spring will come soon.
    japanese:
      - もう すぐ 春 が {来る}。
      - もう すぐ 春 が {来 ます}。
    english_literally: Soon, spring, comes.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう すぐ 春 が {訪れる}。
        english: Spring will visit/arrive soon.
        hint: 「訪れる」 implies a more deliberate or significant 'visit' or 'arrival', often used for seasons
          in a more poetic sense. 「来る」 is more straightforward, simply stating the arrival.
    scene: Observing the changing seasons.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: Using 「来る」 is common for the arrival of seasons, events, or non-physical entities, demonstrating
      its broad applicability beyond literal physical movement of people. The plain form is suitable for
      a general observation.
  - english: He didn't come to the party yesterday.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 昨日 パーティー に {こ なかっ た}。
      - 彼 は 昨日 パーティー に {来 ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: He, yesterday, party to, didn't come.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 昨日 パーティー に {行か なかっ た}。
        english: Using 「行かなかった」 implies the speaker is talking from a neutral perspective of the party's
          location. 「来なかった」 implies the speaker was at the party or views the party location from their
          perspective, noting his absence from 'their' gathering.
        hint: Using 「行かなかった」 implies the speaker is talking from a neutral perspective of the party's
          location. 「来なかった」 implies the speaker was at the party or views the party location from their
          perspective, noting his absence from 'their' gathering.
    scene: Discussing a friend's absence from an event with another friend.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The usage of 「こなかった」 from a female speaker in a casual setting about a friend's absence at
      a party subtly implies that the speaker was also at the party or considered it an event they were
      part of. The casual negative past form is common in such everyday exchanges.
  - english: I can't come because I'm busy.
    japanese:
      - 忙しい の で {こ られ ない}。
      - 忙しい の で {こ られ ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Busy because, cannot come.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 忙しい の で {行け ない}。
        english: I can't go because I'm busy.
        hint: 「行けない」 (cannot go) would be used if you are talking about being unable to go to a location
          away from your current position. 「こられない」 (cannot come) is used when you are unable to move towards
          the listener's location or the implied reference point.
    scene: Someone declining an invitation due to a prior commitment.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: potential (～られる/～える)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「こられない」 is the potential form, meaning 'cannot come' or 'unable to come'. In this context,
      it's a polite, though casual, refusal. The implicit meaning is 'cannot come to your place/event'.
      The use of 「ので」 (because) clearly states the reason for the inability.
  - english: Many people came to our event.
    japanese:
      - 私 達 の イベント に 多く の 方々 が {来 まし た}。
      - 私 達 の イベント に 多く の 方々 が {来 た}。
    english_literally: Our event to, many people, came.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 達 の イベント に 多く の 方々 が {行き まし た}。
        english: Many people went to our event.
        hint: Using 「行きました」 would imply a neutral observation of people moving towards the event. 「来ました」
          frames the event as the speaker's own, making the attendees' movement an act of 'coming' to
          the speaker's sphere of influence or location.
    scene: A company representative reporting on the success of an event.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: Even when the speaker is not physically standing at the entrance to count people, by referring
      to 'our event' (私達 の イベント), the event venue becomes an extension of the speaker's sphere. Thus,
      people arriving are described as 「来ました」 (came), emphasizing their movement towards the company's
      (or speaker's) 'location' or 'sphere of influence'. The polite past form is appropriate for a formal
      report.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate the versatility of 「来る」 in various contexts, from daily
  interactions to more formal or hypothetical situations, and even abstract concepts like seasons. Pay
  close attention to the perspective of the speaker or the implied reference point, as this is crucial
  for determining whether to use 「来る」 (movement towards) or 「行く」 (movement away). The specific conjugation
  used also heavily influences the nuance, formality, and temporal aspect of the expression.
