    "etymology": "The verb 「来る (くる)」 has ancient roots. Its origin can be traced back to the Old Japanese word 「kuru」, which also meant \"to come.\" Over centuries, the pronunciation and kanji have remained consistent, reflecting its fundamental importance in the language for expressing movement towards the speaker or a specified location. It is part of the core vocabulary, and its meaning has remained stable throughout the evolution of Japanese.",
    "writeup": "「来る (くる)」 is an irregular verb, unlike most Japanese verbs. This means its conjugation patterns deviate from the standard rules that govern 「五段 (ごだん)」 and 「一段 (いちだん)」 verbs. It means \"to come\" or \"to be coming.\" It is often used with the particles 「に」 or 「へ」 to indicate the destination.",
