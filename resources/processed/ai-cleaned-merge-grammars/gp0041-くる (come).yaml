        "function": "Indicates movement towards the speaker's location or viewpoint, or a specified location relevant to the speaker.",
        "nuance": "Can express physical movement, the arrival of something, or even a psychological movement of viewpoint. Often used in contrast to 「行く (いく)」, which means 'to go'.",

        "temporal-flow": "Movement towards a point in time or space.",
        "spatial-flow": "Movement towards a reference point (speaker's location, empathic location). Whenever the subject moves towards the speaker or the speaker's viewpoint, 「来る」 is used, regardless of the physical distance involved. This psychological viewpoint is key to its usage."
    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「来る (くる)」 has ancient roots in the Japanese language, tracing back to the Old Japanese period. Its core meaning has remained largely consistent, always indicating movement towards the speaker or a specified location. The kanji 「来」 itself is a pictograph representing a person coming, further emphasizing the verb's primary meaning. Its irregular conjugation is a remnant of older linguistic patterns, making it one of only two major verbs (along with 「する」) that do not follow standard modern conjugation rules.",
    "writeup": "「来る (くる)」 is a fundamental verb meaning \"to come.\" It indicates movement toward the speaker's location, a location relevant to the speaker, or a specific viewpoint the speaker has adopted. Unlike most verbs in Japanese, 「来る」 is an irregular verb (変格活用), specifically a *ka*-column irregular verb (カ変動詞). This means its conjugation patterns deviate significantly from standard *godan* and *ichidan* verbs. The core of its irregularity lies in the fact that the 「る」 at the end of the dictionary form does not conjugate; instead, parts of the stem 「く」 or 「こ」 change depending on the conjugation.\n\n### Usage and Context\n\n*   **Destination**: 「来る」 often appears with particles such as 「に」 or 「へ」 to specify the destination. For example, 「学校 に 来る (がっこう に くる)」 means \"to come to school.\"\n*   **Means of Transportation**: When describing the means of transportation, use the particle 「で」. For example, 「バス で 来る (バス で くる)」 means \"to come by bus.\"\n*   **Viewpoint and Empathy**: A crucial aspect of 「来る」 is its use in relation to the speaker's viewpoint or area of empathy. Even if the speaker is not physically present at the destination, if they view that location as their 'territory' or feel strong empathy for it, 「来る」 can be used. For instance, if you are inviting someone to a party you are hosting, you would use 「来る」 (e.g., 「パーティー に 来る？」 - \"Will you come to the party?\"), even if you are not physically at the party location when inviting them.\n\n### Special Case: 「来ている (きている)」\n\nThe 「～ている」 form of 「来る」, 「来ている」, can have two distinct meanings:\n\n1.  **Progressive Action**: \"to be coming\" (i.e., currently in the process of moving towards the location).\n2.  **Resulting State**: \"to have come and be present\" (i.e., already arrived and currently at the location).\n\nThe specific meaning often depends on the context. For example, if you are on the phone with someone who is on their way, 「今 、 そちら に 来ている」 would mean \"I am coming to your place now.\" However, if someone asks if a guest has arrived, 「お客様 が 来ている」 would mean \"The guest has arrived and is here.\" It's important to note that when 「来ている」 refers to a resulting state of being present, it typically applies to places one has *temporarily* come to, rather than permanent residences like one's own home or workplace. For those, 「いる (to be/exist)」 is usually used.",
