jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  function: Indicates continuation of a state or action, or non-completion of an expected action.
  nuance: Often implies that the continuation or non-completion is somewhat unexpected or noteworthy.
    Can also imply 'not enough' or 'too early'.
  counterpoint: もう (already, anymore)
etymology: The word 「まだ」 originates from the classical Japanese word 「未だ」 (imada), which literally means
  "not yet reached." It carries the nuance of incompleteness or continuation from a past state into the
  present. This etymology reveals its fundamental meaning of something being in a state of continuation
  or uncompletion, which underpins both its 'still' and 'not yet' uses.
writeup: 'The adverb 「まだ」 is a versatile word in Japanese, primarily conveying the idea of continuation,
  persistence, or uncompletion. It is commonly translated as "still" or "not yet," depending on the context
  and the grammatical form of the verb it accompanies. When 「まだ」 is used with affirmative sentences, it
  indicates that something is **still** ongoing or in a particular state, often implying that this continuation
  is somewhat unexpected or noteworthy. For instance, if you expected something to be finished but it
  is not, 「まだ」 highlights its persistence. Conversely, when 「まだ」 is paired with negative verb forms (especially
  the -ない form or -ていません), it signifies that something has **not yet** happened or is not yet complete.
  This usage also carries a nuance of uncompletion relative to an expectation or a set timeline. 「まだ」
  can also be used in questions to inquire about the continuation of a state or action. The speaker might
  be confirming an ongoing situation or asking if something has started/finished as expected. **Important
  Considerations:** *   **Unexpectedness**: A key nuance of 「まだ」 is that the state or action it modifies
  is continuing (or not yet occurring) in a way that might be contrary to expectation. *   **Emphasis
  (まだまだ)**: Repeating 「まだ」 as 「まだまだ」 adds emphasis, suggesting that there is *still* a significant amount
  of continuation or a considerable way to go before completion. This often carries a humble or slightly
  exasperated tone.'

  - term: もう
    meaning: Already, Anymore
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「まだ」, 「もう」 implies that something is already completed or no longer the case. For example,
      「もう 食べ まし た」 means "I have already eaten."
    grammar_point: もう (already・anymore)
  - term: やっと
    meaning: Finally, at last
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「まだ」 (not yet), 「やっと」 signifies that an action or state has finally been achieved after
      a delay or anticipation.
    grammar_point: やっと (finally・barely)
  - term: とっくに
    meaning: Long ago, already (a long time ago)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While 「もう」 means "already," 「とっくに」 emphasizes that something was completed or happened "a
      long time ago," standing in stark contrast to 「まだ」's "not yet" or "still ongoing" meaning.
    grammar_point: とっくに (a long time ago)
  - term: 未だに
    meaning: Even now; still
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「まだ」 simply states continuation or uncompletion, 「未だに」 carries a stronger nuance of
      surprise or dissatisfaction that something is *still* the case, especially when it was expected
      to have changed by now. It often implies a prolonged, perhaps unexpected, state.
    grammar_point: 未だに (even now)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the distinction between 「まだ」 and 「もう」 is crucial. 「まだ」 signals
  that something is continuing or has not yet reached completion, often contrary to expectation. In contrast,
  「もう」 indicates that something has already concluded or is no longer in a certain state. Grasping the
  context is key to correctly applying these adverbs. When comparing 「まだ」 and 「未だに」, remember that 「未だに」
  emphasizes a longer or more unexpected continuation, often with a sense of lingering or surprise.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 語 は {ペラペラ 話せ ませ ん}。
        english: I can't speak Japanese fluently.
        hint: This states a lack of fluency. We need to convey that the speaker *cannot yet* speak fluently,
          implying a current state short of a desired goal.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{やっと} 日本 語 が 話せる よう に なり まし た。'
        english: I finally became able to speak Japanese.
        hint: This means you *finally* became able to speak Japanese. We're looking for a phrase that
          indicates you *cannot yet* speak fluently.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{もう} 日本 語 は ペラペラ です。'
        english: I'm already fluent in Japanese.
        hint: This means you are *already* fluent. We're looking for a phrase that indicates you *cannot
          yet* speak fluently.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{とっく に} 日本 語 は ペラペラ に なっ て い ます。'
        english: I became fluent in Japanese a long time ago.
        hint: This states you became fluent *a long time ago*. We're looking for a phrase that indicates
          you *cannot yet* speak fluently.
    scene: A foreign student modestly assessing their Japanese language ability to a native speaker.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「まだ ペラペラ 話せません」 suggests that while the speaker might aspire to fluency, they are 'not yet'
      at that desired level. It implies a current inadequacy but also potential for future improvement.
      「完璧 じゃ ない ん です よ」 is a natural, modest admission of incompleteness, often used with 「～んです」 to explain
      a situation.
post_example_writeup: When 「まだ」 is combined with the 「～ていません」 form, it specifically indicates that an
  action has not yet been completed. For example, 「まだ 食べて いません」 means "I haven't eaten yet," clearly stating
  the unfulfilled status of the action.
