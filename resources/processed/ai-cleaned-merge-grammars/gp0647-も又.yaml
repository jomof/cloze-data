    "etymology": "「も」 indicates 'also' or 'too,' while 「又」 (mata) means 'again' or 'moreover.' The combination emphasizes the additive or repetitive nature of the statement.",
    "writeup": "「も又」 (mo mata) functions as an adverbial phrase that emphasizes that something is 'also' true or applicable, similar to a stronger version of 「も」 alone. It can also mean \"even\". It connects nouns or noun phrases, highlighting the primary point of a statement, regardless of contrasting opinions. While it is often written in hiragana, understanding the kanji 「又」 helps clarify its meaning of 'again' or 'furthermore.' This grammar point lends a formal tone to the sentence.",
