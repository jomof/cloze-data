        "usage-context": "Primarily used in formal or literary contexts, often conveying a sense of weighty addition or repetition. It emphasizes that a statement holds true despite other considerations.",
        "function": "Adds emphasis to an additional point or reiterates a previous action/state.",
        "nuance": "Stronger than も (mo) alone, it highlights the significance of the added element or the repetition of an action. It can introduce a contrasting but equally true point, or simply mean 'again' in a more formal tone.",
        "source": "Academic writings, formal speeches, literary works.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions adverbially, modifying clauses or entire sentences."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「も」 (mo) functions as 'also' or 'too.' The word 「又」 (mata) inherently means 'again,' 'also,' or 'moreover.' When combined, 「も又」 amplifies the additive or repetitive nuance of 「も」, creating a more formal or emphatic expression of 'also' or 'again.' While often written in hiragana, understanding the kanji 「又」 (again, moreover) clarifies its reinforcing nature.",
    "writeup": "The grammatical structure 「も又」 (mo mata) is an adverbial phrase that emphasizes that something is 'also' true or applicable, or that an action occurs 'again.' It serves as a more emphatic version of 「も」 alone. This construction typically follows nouns or noun-like phrases, drawing attention to the primary point of a statement, even if there are contrasting opinions or facts presented within the same sentence. It is frequently encountered in formal writing, speeches, and literary contexts, giving the sentence a more profound or assertive tone. When 「も又」 is used to mean 'again,' it carries a slightly more formal or reflective nuance than a simple 「また」. It can be used to acknowledge an additional truth or to re-emphasize the recurrence of an event or situation.",
