        "[Noun] + の代わりに": "Indicates that the following action or state replaces or substitutes the noun.",

        "function": "Indicates that something or someone is being used as a substitute for another thing or person, or that an action/state is performed as compensation or a trade-off for another.",
        "nuance": "This grammar point carries the nuance of exchange, replacement, or compensation. It highlights a relationship where one thing or action is given or done in lieu of another, or where a positive or negative aspect is balanced by another. It can imply a direct substitution, or a 'give and take' relationship where one aspect compensates for another, often contrasting, aspect. While it can connect contrasting ideas like けれど or しかし, 代わりに specifically implies an exchange or replacement, not just a simple contrast."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「代わりに」 comes from the noun 「代わり」 (kawari), which means \"substitute\" or \"replacement,\" combined with the particle 「に」 (ni), indicating a purpose or function. Thus, 「代わりに」 literally means \"in the role of a substitute.\" Over time, its usage expanded to encompass notions of compensation and trade-offs beyond simple direct replacement.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「代わりに・かわりに」 (kawari ni) is used to express ideas of substitution, replacement, or compensation. It connects two clauses or phrases, indicating that one element or action occurs in the place of another, or that one aspect serves to balance or make up for another.\n\nThere are primarily two ways 「代わりに」 is used:\n\n1.  **Substitution/Replacement (Nounの代わりに):** When attached to a noun with 「の」, 「代わりに」 means \"instead of [Noun]\" or \"in place of [Noun].\" It indicates a direct substitution, where the original noun is replaced by something or someone else.\n    *   Examples: 先生の代わりに (in place of the teacher), 電車の代わりに (instead of the train).\n\n2.  **Compensation/Trade-off (Verb/Adjective plain form + 代わりに):** When attached to a plain form verb or adjective (including Adjective い and Adjective な), 「代わりに」 indicates a compensatory relationship or a trade-off. This usage implies that while one thing is true or one action is taken, another action or state occurs to balance it out, often suggesting that one aspect is done \"in return for\" or \"to make up for\" another. It can also be used to show a contrasting aspect that compensates for another.\n    *   For verbs, it means \"to make up for [Verb-ing]\" or \"in return for [Verb-ing].\"\n    *   For Adjective い and Adjective な, it conveys a sense of \"although it is [Adjective], in return...\" or \"it is [Adjective], but in exchange...\" It highlights a contrasting characteristic that provides a balance or compensation for the preceding characteristic.\n\nThis grammar point emphasizes the notion of an exchange or balance between two elements, whether it's a direct replacement or a more abstract compensation.",
