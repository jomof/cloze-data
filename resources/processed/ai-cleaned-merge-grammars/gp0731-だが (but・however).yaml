etymology: だが is derived from the plain form of the copula だ followed by the conjunctive particle が. The
  particle が itself has a long history of introducing clauses that contrast or present a condition. In
  Old Japanese, が served various functions, including marking a concessive or contrastive relationship.
  Over time, the combination with the copula だ solidified its role as a conjunction for 'but' or 'however,'
  maintaining a slightly more formal or assertive tone than けれど or けど. It often implies that what follows
  contradicts or qualifies what came before.
writeup: だが is a versatile conjunction in Japanese that serves to connect two clauses with a sense of
  contrast, contradiction, or unexpectedness. Similar to "but" or "however" in English, it introduces
  a statement that modifies or opposes the preceding one. While it can be used in both spoken and written
  Japanese, だが tends to carry a slightly more formal or assertive nuance compared to けれど or けど, especially
  in spoken contexts where けれど is often preferred for its softer tone. It is commonly used when presenting
  a counter-argument, a qualification, or an obstacle to what was just stated. だが attaches directly to
  the plain form of verbs, i-adjectives, na-adjectives (dropping the だ), and nouns (adding だ).

  - term: しかし
    meaning: however, but
    kind: synonym
    nuance: しかし is generally more formal and often used at the beginning of a sentence or clause to introduce
      a strong contrast or shift in topic. だが can be used similarly, but it feels slightly less formal
      and can sound more abrupt or direct, especially in speech.
    grammar_point: しかし (but・however)
  - term: けれど
    meaning: but, although
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: けれど (and its more casual form けど) is softer, less assertive, and more conversational than
      だが. It often implies a milder contrast or concession and is frequently used to politely introduce
      a differing opinion or a question.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:けれど (but)
  - term: ところが
    meaning: however, by contrast (with unexpectedness)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ところが strongly emphasizes an unexpected or surprising turn of events that contrasts with what
      was anticipated or previously stated. だが simply states a contrast, while ところが often implies "contrary
      to expectation."
    grammar_point: ところが (unexpected contrast)
  - term: ものの
    meaning: although, but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ものの implies a concession or acknowledgment of a fact, followed by a contrasting or somewhat
      negative outcome, often feeling more literary or formal. だが is more of a direct counter-statement.
    grammar_point: ものの (although・but)
post_false_friends_writeup: While だが and its counterparts like しかし, けれど, ところが, and ものの all convey a sense
  of contrast or opposition, their usage differs in formality, nuance, and the strength of the unexpectedness
  they express. だが occupies a middle ground, being more direct than けれど and less formal than しかし, while
  ところが highlights surprise and ものの emphasizes concession with a subsequent negative or unexpected result.
  Choosing the right one depends on the specific context and the speaker's desired emphasis.
