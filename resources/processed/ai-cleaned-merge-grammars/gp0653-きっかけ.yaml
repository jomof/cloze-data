    },
    "etymology": "The word 「きっかけ」 originally comes from the verb 「蹴る(ける)」(keru), meaning \"to kick\". The 「切(き)」(ki) part implies a decisive action or cut-off point, leading to a new phase. Thus, 「きっかけ」 represents the 'kick-off' point or trigger that initiates something new.",
    "writeup": "「きっかけ」(kikkake) is a noun that expresses the trigger of event A leading to result B. It is often translated as \"because of A, B\" or \"with A as a trigger, B.\" It primarily appears in two forms: **(A)をきっかけに(B)** and **(A)がきっかけで(B)**.\n\nThis pattern can be used with nouns directly. When used with verbs, the verb typically needs to be nominalized, often by preceding 「きっかけ」 with 「の」 or 「こと」 (e.g., 彼女と会った**のがきっかけ**で).\n\nIn many cases, trigger A will instigate a significant change or a new beginning. It is **important** to note that 「きっかけ」 is typically *not* used when the causal relationship between A and B is plainly obvious or easily anticipated. Instead, it refers to an opportunity arising from A, where an external choice or action is taken, making A a catalyst rather than a direct cause.\n\nConsider 「きっかけ」 as the 'catalyst' for a new development, where the preceding event or situation provides the impetus for something new to begin or for a significant change to occur.",

            "nuance": "While 「きっかけ」 highlights an initiating factor that leads to a new development, 「に伴って・に伴い」 describes an accompanying change or consequence that occurs simultaneously or subsequently. It focuses on correlation rather than being the direct trigger for something new."
