    "etymology": "The word 「きっかけ」 originally comes from the verb 「蹴る(ける)」(keru), meaning \"to kick\". The 「切(き)」(ki) part implies a decisive action or cut-off point, leading to a new phase. Thus, 「きっかけ」 represents the 'kick-off' point or trigger that initiates something new.",
    "writeup": "「きっかけ」(kikkake) is a noun that expresses the trigger of event A leading to result B. It's often translated as \"because of A, B\" or \"with A as a trigger, B.\" It primarily appears in two forms: (A)をきっかけに(B) and (A)がきっかけで(B). This pattern can be used with verbs in the past tense or nouns. When used with verbs, it's often preceded by 「の」 or 「こと」 to nominalize the verb.\n\nIn many cases, trigger A will instigate a significant change or new beginning. It's **important** to note that 「きっかけ」 isn't used when the causal relationship between A and B is obvious or easily anticipated. Instead, it refers to an opportunity arising from A, where an external choice or action is taken.\n\nThink of it as A providing the **catalyst** for B, but not directly causing it.",
