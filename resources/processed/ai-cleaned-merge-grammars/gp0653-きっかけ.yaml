    "etymology": "「きっかけ」 originates from 「切っ掛け(きっかけ)」, which literally means 'a start point for cutting.' It implies the initial action or event that triggers a subsequent development or change. The verb 「切る(きる)」 means 'to cut,' and 「掛け(かけ)」 refers to a start or a hook.",
    "writeup": "「きっかけ」(kikkake), written as 「切っ掛け」in kanji, is a noun that expresses how trigger (A) led to result (B). It can be translated as \"because of (A), (B),\" \"with (A) as a trigger, (B),\" or \"with the opportunity of (A), (B).\" It primarily appears in two forms: (A)をきっかけに(B) or (A)がきっかけで(B).  This grammar pattern can follow past-tense verbs or nouns. When following verbs, it's often preceded by 「の」 or another nominalizing element like 「こと」.\n\nOften, trigger (A) instigates a significant change or new beginning.  It's **important** to note that 「きっかけ」 isn't used when the causal relationship between (A) and (B) is obvious or expected.  Therefore, 「きっかけ」 usually refers to an opportunity where (B) appears because of (A), involving an external choice or action based on that occasion.",
