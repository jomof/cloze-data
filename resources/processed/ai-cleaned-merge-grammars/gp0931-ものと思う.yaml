In this context, it adds a sense of concreteness or certainty to the thought. 「と」 is a particle indicating the content of thought or speech. 「思う (omou)」 means 'to think.' Together, they create a sense of thinking of something as a concrete fact.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ものと思う」 is used to express a strong conviction or expectation. It is formed by connecting the noun 「物 (mono)」, the particle 「と」, and the verb 「思う (omou)」. The literal meaning is 'to think of something as a concrete matter.' This phrase elevates a mere opinion or thought to a belief that is treated as a solid, undeniable fact, at least from the speaker's perspective. It conveys a strong sense of certainty, often implying that the speaker has good reason for their conviction, or that the belief is deeply ingrained. While it can be used in spoken Japanese, especially in formal contexts like speeches or declarations, it is more commonly found in written language due to its somewhat rigid and assertive nuance.",

            "nuance": "「〜と確信する」 expresses absolute certainty or conviction, whereas 「ものと思う」 implies a very strong belief or expectation that something is true, but may allow for a slight degree of uncertainty or acknowledge that it's the speaker's strong perspective."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ものと思う」, 「〜と思う」, 「〜と考える」, and 「〜と確信する」 all relate to expressing thoughts or beliefs, they differ significantly in the level of conviction and nuance. 「ものと思う」 asserts a strong, almost factual belief, treating the thought as a concrete reality. 「〜と思う」 is a general expression of opinion, less forceful. 「〜と考える」 implies more deliberation or a logical process of thought. 「〜と確信する」, on the other hand, conveys an absolute certainty, leaving no room for doubt. Choosing the correct expression depends on the precise degree of certainty and the nature of the belief one wishes to convey.",
