    "etymology": "「物 (mono)」 means 'thing' or 'matter.' In this context, it adds a sense of concreteness or certainty to the thought. 「と」 is a particle indicating the content of thought or speech. 「思う (omou)」 means 'to think.' Together, they create a sense of thinking of something as a concrete fact.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ものと思う」 is used to express a strong belief, expectation, or conviction. It is comprised of the noun 「物 (mono)」, the particle 「と」, and the verb 「思う (omou)」. The basic meaning is \"to think that something is a certain way,\" but it implies a stronger sense of certainty than simply saying 「思う」. Because 「もの」 is a noun, this pattern may follow any word in its attributive form. While slightly formal, it occasionally appears in daily speech. Using the past tense 「ものと思っていた」 means \"I was under the impression that (A)\" or \"as I had believed was true of (A).\"",
