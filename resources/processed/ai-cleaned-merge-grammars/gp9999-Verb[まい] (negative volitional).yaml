details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to express either a strong negative volition (the speaker's firm decision not to
    do something) or a strong negative conjecture (the speaker's high certainty that something will not
    happen or exist). Often found in formal writing, literary contexts, or when conveying a particularly
    strong personal resolve or definitive prediction.
  function: Expresses negative volition or negative conjecture.
  nuance: Carries a stronger, more decisive, and often more formal nuance compared to simpler negative
    expressions like 「〜ないだろう」 or 「〜つもりはない」. It suggests a firm internal commitment or a high degree of
    certainty about a negative outcome.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a negative auxiliary verb, attaching to various verb forms to modify
    their meaning to one of non-action or non-occurrence.
etymology: 'The auxiliary verb 「まい」 is a modern evolution of the classical Japanese negative auxiliary
  verb 「まじ」. Historically, 「まじ」 was formed from the negative suffix 「ま」 combined with the conjectural/volitional
  suffix 「じ」. This etymology explains 「まい」''s dual functions: expressing a firm refusal or strong intention
  not to do something (volition), and conveying a strong belief that something will not happen or exist
  (conjecture). Its classical roots contribute to its often formal or literary tone in modern Japanese.'
writeup: |-
  The Japanese auxiliary verb 「まい」 is used to express either **negative volition** (the speaker's strong intention not to do something) or **negative conjecture** (the speaker's strong belief that something probably will not happen). It carries a more formal or literary nuance compared to the more common expressions like 「〜ないだろう」 (for conjecture) or 「〜つもりはない」 (for volition).

  When expressing **negative volition**, 「まい」 signifies a firm, often decisive, personal resolve not to perform an action. This usage is typically found in the first person. For example, 「二度と 同じ 失敗 は {するまい}。」 (I will never make the same mistake again.) conveys a powerful internal commitment. It can also be used in self-admonition or a strong vow to oneself.

  When expressing **negative conjecture**, 「まい」 conveys a high degree of certainty that something will not occur or exist. This usage can be applied to any person (first, second, or third) or impersonal situations. For example, 「彼 は 来るまい。」 (He probably won't come.) implies a strong conviction based on observation or logical deduction. It suggests a more definitive non-occurrence than simply 「来ないだろう」.

  **Formation of 「まい」**:

  *   **Godan Verbs**: Can attach to the dictionary form (e.g., 行くまい 'ikuma-i') or the V-ない stem (e.g., 行かまい 'ikama-i'). The dictionary form attachment is more common in modern Japanese, while the V-ない stem attachment is somewhat older or literary, though still understood.
  *   **Ichidan Verbs**: Can attach to the dictionary form (e.g., 食べるまい 'taberuma-i') or the verb stem (e.g., 食べまい 'tabema-i'). Both are common, with the stem form often sounding slightly more concise or firm.
  *   **Irregular Verbs (する and くる)**:
      *   する: Becomes 「するまい」 or the more concise, less common 「すまい」.
      *   くる: Becomes 「くるまい」 or the more concise, less common 「こまい」.

  「まい」 is often found in combination with adverbs like 「決して」 (kesshite - never) or 「断じて」 (danjite - absolutely), which further emphasize the strong negative meaning. While versatile, its formal or literary tone means it is less frequently heard in casual, everyday conversation.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜ないだろう
    meaning: probably won't; probably isn't
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express negative conjecture, 「〜ないだろう」 is a more general and common expression,
      implying a casual prediction or possibility. 「まい」 conveys a stronger, more decisive certainty about
      non-occurrence and is more formal or literary.
    grammar_point: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
  - term: 〜つもりはない
    meaning: don't intend to; have no intention of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both express negative volition. 「〜つもりはない」 is a straightforward statement of intention. 「まい」,
      especially with the first person, expresses a stronger, more emphatic, and often more formal personal
      resolve not to do something. It implies a firm decision or a solemn vow.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]つもりだ (to intend to)'
  - term: 〜べきではない
    meaning: should not; ought not to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜べきではない」 expresses a moral obligation or a general principle that something should not be
      done. 「まい」, when used for 'should not', often reflects a strong personal conviction or a rhetorical
      prohibition, implying 'I would never do X' or 'X must not be done' due to its nature rather than
      an external rule.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]べき・べきではない (should・should not)'
  - term: 〜てはいけない
    meaning: must not; may not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てはいけない」 conveys a direct, often external, prohibition or rule. 「まい」 can express a strong,
      almost internal, prohibition or admonition (e.g., a self-vow 'I must not do this') or a rhetorical
      prohibition where the impossibility or inappropriateness of the action is emphasized.
    grammar_point: 〜てはいけない・〜てはならない (must not)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「まい」 and other negative expressions, consider the level
  of formality and the strength of the speaker's conviction or certainty. Use 「まい」 for more definitive
  statements of non-volition or non-conjecture, particularly in formal or written contexts. For everyday,
  casual expressions of 'probably won't' or 'don't intend to', 「〜ないだろう」 and 「〜つもりはない」 are generally more
  appropriate. 「〜べきではない」 and 「〜てはいけない」 emphasize obligation or rule-based prohibition, whereas 「まい」 leans
  more towards personal resolve or strong conjecture.

    japanese:
      - この 日 は {忘れる まい}。
      - この 日 は {忘れ まい}。
    english_literally: This day, I will probably not forget.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 日 は 忘れ ない だろう。
        english: I probably won't forget this day.
        hint: 「〜ないだろう」 is a softer, more general conjecture. We're looking for a stronger, more determined
          personal resolve.
    scene: Someone reflecting on a deeply significant and memorable event, making a solemn vow to themselves.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The use of 「忘れるまい」 expresses a strong, almost solemn, personal resolve not to forget, highlighting
      a deep emotional impact of the day. It's a firmer statement than a simple 'I won't forget'.
  - english: I won't lose this time!
    japanese:
      - 今度 こそ {負ける まい}！
      - 今度 こそ {負け まい}！

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今度 こそ 負け ない！
        english: I won't lose this time!
        hint: 「負けない」 is a direct negative statement. We're looking for a phrase that expresses a strong,
          determined personal vow not to lose.
    scene: A competitor, having lost previously, expresses intense determination before a rematch.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「負けるまい」 conveys a powerful, resolute personal determination to not lose, often spoken with
      strong conviction. It emphasizes the speaker's inner vow and fighting spirit.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は パーティー に は 来 ない だろう。
        english: He probably won't come to the party.
        hint: While similar in meaning, 「来ないだろう」 is a more common, less definitive conjecture. We're looking
          for a stronger conviction about non-occurrence.
    scene: Two friends discussing a mutual acquaintance's attendance at a party, one expressing a strong
      belief about their absence.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「来まい」 here expresses a strong negative conjecture about a third party's action, suggesting
      a high degree of certainty that they will not come, perhaps due to their known habits or circumstances.
      It is more definitive than a mere prediction.
  - english: This kind of opportunity probably won't come again.
    japanese:
      - この よう な 機会 は 二 度 と {ある まい}。
      - この よう な 機会 は 二 度 と {あら まい}。
    english_literally: This kind of opportunity, a second time, probably will not exist.

      - competing_japanese:
          - この よう な 機会 は 二 度 と ない だろう。
        english: This kind of opportunity probably won't exist a second time.

    scene: Someone lamenting a lost or missed opportunity, expressing a sense of finality about its uniqueness.
    register: formal
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: The use of 「あるまい」 impersonally emphasizes the definitive unlikelihood of such a rare opportunity
      recurring, conveying a sense of regret or finality.
  - english: How could I possibly say such a thing?

          - 私 が そんな こと を 言う はず が ない。
        english: It's impossible for me to say such a thing.
        hint: 「〜はずがない」 indicates impossibility based on logical expectation. We're looking for a rhetorical
          question that strongly denies the speaker's own action.
    scene: Someone being falsely accused of saying something, vehemently denying it with a rhetorical
      question.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「言うまいか」 functions as a rhetorical question, strongly asserting that the speaker would never
      say such a thing. It emphasizes the speaker's disbelief and firm conviction about their own character
      or actions.
  - english: You absolutely should not talk about such things here.
    japanese:
      - ここ で そんな 話 を {する まい}。
      - ここ で そんな 話 を {す まい}。

        english: You should not talk about such things here.
        hint: 「〜べきではない」 expresses 'should not' based on general propriety or duty. We're looking for a
          stronger, almost admonishing, prohibition.
    scene: A senior colleague or mentor firmly advises a junior one against discussing sensitive topics
      in an inappropriate setting.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: When used in a prohibitive sense like this, 「するまい」 carries a strong, almost admonishing tone,
      conveying that the action is highly inappropriate or impermissible in the given context. It's a
      firmer caution than simply 'should not'.
  - english: They resolved not to surrender.
    japanese:

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 賛成 し ない と 思う。
        english: I think he won't agree.
        hint: 「しないと思う」 is a milder statement of expected non-agreement. We're looking for an expression
          that suggests a stronger conviction or higher certainty that he will not agree.
    scene: Someone predicting another's reaction based on their knowledge of that person, expressing a
      strong internal conviction.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Combining 「するまい」 with 「と 思う」 expresses the speaker's strong conviction or a well-informed
      prediction that the third party will not agree. It implies a higher degree of certainty than simply

          resolution.
    scene: Someone making a firm personal decision to change their dietary habits.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The direct attachment of 「まい」 to the ichidan verb's dictionary form (食べる) shows a clear and
      firm personal decision. It sounds more resolute than a mere intention, conveying a strong personal
      commitment.
  - english: I won't buy unnecessary things.

          - 無駄 な もの は 買わ ない。
        english: I won't buy unnecessary things.

          from the speaker to themselves.
    scene: Someone reflecting on past errors and making a strong internal vow not to make them again,
      showing self-discipline.
    register: formal
