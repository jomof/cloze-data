For instance, if you can clearly see that a wooden table is indeed made of wood, 「木でできている」 would be appropriate. It focuses on the direct and apparent use of the material in the final product.\n\nThere is a subtle distinction in nuance between 「できる」 and 「できている」 in this construction:\n*   **「できる」**: Refers to a general fact or a broad statement about what something is typically made of. It describes a general property or the potential for something to be made from a material.\n*   **「できている」**: Refers to a specific item and its current state of being made from a particular material. It describes the existing composition of a single object.\n\nThis distinguishes it from 「からできる」, which is used when the material undergoes a significant transformation, making the original substance less obvious in the final product. While 「でできる」 might sometimes be used loosely in such cases in contemporary Japanese, its core nuance lies in the direct traceability of the material.",
