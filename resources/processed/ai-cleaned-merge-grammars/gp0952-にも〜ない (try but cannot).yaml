etymology: The pattern 「にも〜ない」 combines 「にも」, which adds emphasis, with a verb in both its volitional
  (intention) and potential negative forms. This pairing highlights the contrast between wanting to perform
  an action and being unable to do so. The repetition of the verb emphasizes the futility of the attempt.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「にも〜ない」 expresses the idea that despite wanting to do something, one is unable to. It emphasizes a situation where there's a strong desire to act, but external circumstances or limitations prevent it. It often conveys a sense of frustration or helplessness.

  The core structure involves repeating the same verb in two forms:

  *   Volitional form (意向形): Expresses intention or will, like 「しよう」 (let's do).
  *   Negative potential form (不可能形): Indicates inability, like 「できない」 (cannot do).

  For example, 「帰ろうにも帰れない」 (kaerou ni mo kaerenai) literally translates to "Even if I try to go home, I cannot go home," conveying "I want to go home, but I can't."

  **Important Considerations**

  This pattern often highlights **physical reasons** or **external constraints** that prevent the action. However, this grammar pattern can also be used to express mental limitations. In such cases, the speaker doesn't want to do something, but a social situation means it is difficult to refuse.
false_friends:
  - term: どんなに〜ても
    meaning: No matter how
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「にも〜ない」, 「どんなに〜ても」 does not imply an inability to perform an action, but rather a lack
      of effect or change despite the degree of effort.
    grammar_point: どんなに〜ても (no matter how much)
  - term: に〜ない
    meaning: cannot (due to constraint or lack of capacity)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「にも〜ない」 which explicitly expresses 'even if one tries, one cannot,' 「に〜ない」 (used in
      constructions like `〜するに〜ない`) more generally implies an inability due to a constraint or lack of
      inherent capacity, often without the explicit 'trying' element. It does not repeat the verb in volitional
      and potential forms.
    grammar_point: '<suggest>: に〜ない (general inability)'
post_false_friends_writeup: The key difference between 「にも〜ない」 and similar expressions lies in their nuance.
  While 「どんなに〜ても」 emphasizes the degree of effort without necessarily implying impossibility, 「にも〜ない」
  highlights the inability to perform an action despite the desire to do so. Meanwhile, while 「に〜ない」 also
  means "cannot", it pairs with verbs in dictionary form and tends to refer to inability due to a constraint
  or lack of capacity. Keep in mind that 「にも〜ない」 uses the volitional form.

        english: No matter how much I try to refuse, it's an atmosphere where I can't refuse.
        hint: This emphasizes the degree of effort to refuse. We're looking for an expression that captures

    scene: An employee feels pressured to attend a company event.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「断ろうにも断れない雰囲気」 implies a strong social obligation often felt by younger employees
      toward their seniors in a Japanese professional setting. It conveys that despite the speaker's personal
      desire to decline, the social pressure makes it practically impossible. The use of 「〜ねぇ」 in the
      casual Japanese variation is a masculine, younger-sounding contraction.
post_example_writeup: This grammar point is incredibly useful for expressing a sense of powerlessness
  or frustration in situations where one's intentions are thwarted by external realities. Pay close attention
  to the repetition of the verb, first in its volitional form and then its potential negative form, as
  this is the defining characteristic of this construction. It paints a vivid picture of a desire met
  with an insurmountable obstacle. While it can apply to physical inability, remember its strength in
  describing situations where social pressure or emotional states prevent an action, as seen in the example
  about the drinking party.
