details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: General use
  function: Expresses an action that was on the verge of occurring but did not materialize or was interrupted.
  nuance: Often implies a narrow miss, a near-disaster, or a missed opportunity. Can convey relief (if
    a bad outcome was avoided) or regret (if a good outcome was missed).
  grammatical-role: Functions as a predicate to describe a state of being on the verge of an action.
  temporal-flow: Describes an action that was immediately impending but then halted or prevented. The
    past tense of the copula 「だった」 explicitly places this 'verge' state in the past, meaning the action
    itself did not come to full fruition or completion at that time. Contrast with 「ところだ」, which describes
    something presently impending, ongoing, or just completed.
etymology: 「ところ」 (tokoro) means 'place' or 'situation'. 「だった」 (datta) is the past tense of the copula
  「だ」 (da), indicating a state that existed in the past. Thus, 「ところだった」 implies 'was in the situation
  of' or 'was about to be in the state of'. It conveys a sense of near-miss or interrupted action. The
  nuance of 'almost' or 'narrowly missed' is derived from the inherent nature of being at a critical 'point'
  immediately before an event, and the subsequent past tense indicating that this critical point has passed
  without the event fully realizing itself.
writeup: |-
  「ところだった」 is a versatile grammatical expression indicating that an action or event was on the verge of happening but ultimately did not occur, or was interrupted. It conveys a strong sense of a 'near miss' or an 'almost' situation. The phrase is typically appended to the dictionary form of a verb (Vる).

  This pattern emphasizes that the speaker (or subject) was at the precise 'point' or 'juncture' (ところ) of performing an action, and then something intervened. The resulting implication can vary:

  *   **Relief**: When a negative outcome was narrowly avoided. For instance, if you almost had an accident but managed to prevent it. In such cases, adverbs like 「危うく」 (ayauku - barely, narrowly, almost) are often used to emphasize the close call.
  *   **Regret or Disappointment**: When a desired outcome was just about to materialize but was thwarted. For example, if you were just about to receive good news, but something prevented it. When this regret is strong, it is common to see 「のに」 (noni) appended after 「ところだった」, expressing 'even though I was just about to do X, Y happened (which is regrettable/contrary to expectation)'.

  While 「ところだった」 itself is a plain form, its usage is common across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal settings, depending on the surrounding sentence structure and politeness markers (e.g., adding 「です」).

  - term: ところだ
    meaning: About to do something; in the process of doing something; just finished doing something (depending
      on preceding verb form)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ところだった」 which describes an action that was *about to happen but was interrupted or
      did not materialize*, 「ところだ」 indicates an an action that is *currently about to happen*, *in the
      process of happening*, or has *just happened*. The key difference is that with 「ところだ」, the action
      is either impending, ongoing, or completed, whereas with 「ところだった」, the action did *not* complete.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-た]ところだ (just finished doing)'
  - term: ～ようとする
    meaning: to try to do; to be about to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ところだった」 emphasizes being on the *verge* of an action, often with an external interruption
      preventing it, 「～ようとする」 focuses on the *attempt* or *intention* itself, which may or may not be
      successful. 「ところだった」 often implies an external factor, whereas 「～ようとする」 is more about the subject's
      will or effort.
    grammar_point: Verb[volitional]+とする (try about to)
  - term: ～そうになる
    meaning: to almost do something; to be on the verge of doing something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「ところだった」 in conveying a near miss, 「～そうになる」 focuses more on the *appearance* or
      *likelihood* of an action being carried out, rather than the 'point' or 'juncture' of the action.
      「ところだった」 often carries a stronger sense of a situation or circumstance, while 「～そうになる」 is more about
      the visual or perceived imminence of the action.
    grammar_point: そうになる (almost・on the verge of)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ところだった」 vividly captures the essence of a narrow escape or a missed
  opportunity—an action that was on the brink of happening but didn't—it is crucial to distinguish it
  from similar expressions. 「ところだ」 describes something currently impending or just completed, directly
  contrasting the unfulfilled nature of 「ところだった」. Similarly, 「～ようとする」 indicates an an attempt or intention,
  focusing on the actor's will, whereas 「ところだった」 emphasizes the external circumstances that prevented
  completion. Lastly, 「～そうになる」 highlights the appearance or likelihood of an action being carried out,
  often used for physically observable near-misses, while 「ところだった」 can apply more broadly to situations
  and mental states of being on the verge. Careful attention to these nuances is key to conveying your
  exact meaning.
examples:
  - english: I almost ran a red light, and nearly got into an accident.
    japanese:
      - 信号 無視 し そう に なっ て、危うく 事故 に なる {ところ だっ た}。
      - 信号 無視 し そう に なっ て、危うく 事故 に なる {ところ でし た}。

          - 信号 無視 {しよう と し た} が、事故 に なっ た。
        english: I tried to run a red light, and had an accident.
        hint: 「～ようとする」 expresses an attempt or intention. We're looking for a phrase that expresses being
          on the verge of an action that was prevented.
    scene: A driver braking just in time at an intersection.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    nuance: The phrase 「危うく」 (ayauku - barely, narrowly, almost) commonly precedes 「ところだった」 to emphasize
      a close call and the relief of avoiding a negative outcome. The final 「ぜ」 in the casual Japanese
      variation adds a masculine, assertive tone, often used when recounting a close call to a peer.
    etymology: The interjection 「ぜ」 is a masculine sentence-ending particle that has evolved from older
      forms like 「ぞ」, used to assert or emphasize a statement with a strong, often informal, tone. It
      adds a sense of personal experience and directness to the recount of the near-miss.
  - english: I almost missed my train, but it turned out the next one was faster.
    japanese:
      - 電車 に 乗り 遅れる {ところ だっ た} けど、次 の 電車 の 方 が 早かっ た よ。

        english: I almost seemed to miss the train, but I managed to get on safely.
        hint: 「～そうになる」 indicates the *appearance* of nearly doing something. We're looking for a phrase
          that implies being on the *verge* of an action, with a specific outcome.
    scene: You're at the train station, talking to a friend, feeling relieved about a near miss that turned
      out well.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of 「けど」 (kedo) softens the statement, implying a positive unexpected outcome that
      you are now reflecting on. 「乗り遅れる」 (noriokureru) specifically means to miss a train, bus, or plane.
      The casual 「よ」 at the end emphasizes sharing information with the listener.
    etymology: The particle 「よ」 is used to add emphasis or convey new information, originating from the
      vocative particle 「えよ」, which was used to call out to someone. Over time, it evolved to its modern
      function of drawing attention to what is being said.
  - english: I was just about to call him, but then he called me instead.
    japanese:
      - ちょうど 彼 に 電話 する {ところ だっ た} ん だ けど、彼 から かかっ て き た よ。

          being at the precise point of an action.
    scene: You pick up your phone, preparing to dial, when it suddenly rings with an incoming call from
      the person you were about to call.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「ちょうど」 (choudo) emphasizes the perfect timing, highlighting that you were at the exact moment
      of initiating the action. 「んだけど」 (n'dakedo) functions as a soft conjunction, introducing the unexpected
      turn of events while maintaining a casual tone.
    etymology: The particle 「ん」 in 「んだけど」 is a contracted form of 「の」, used for explanation or emphasis,
      making the preceding clause a nominalized phrase. This usage adds a nuance of common ground or shared
      understanding to the statement.
  - english: I almost forgot my passport at home, but I remembered it just before leaving.
    japanese:
      - 危うく パスポート を 家 に 忘れる {ところ だっ た} けど、出る 直前 に 思い出し た よ。

        english: I almost seemed to forget my passport, but I remembered it.
        hint: 「～そうになる」 implies the *appearance* of an action being imminent. We're looking for a phrase
          that expresses being at the *critical point* of forgetting, narrowly averted.
    scene: You're standing by the door, about to head out for a trip, when you suddenly have a flash of
      realization and rush back inside.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    nuance: 「危うく」 (ayauku) intensifies the 'narrow miss' aspect, strongly conveying relief. 「出る 直前 に」
      (deru chokuzen ni) emphasizes the last-minute nature of remembering, creating a sense of tension
      and fortunate avoidance.
    etymology: The adverb 「危うく」 comes from the adjective 「危うい」 (ayaui), meaning 'dangerous' or 'narrow'.
      Its use here highlights the dangerous proximity of forgetting something essential, emphasizing the
      averted catastrophe.
  - english: I was about to raise my hand, but then someone else answered the question.
    japanese:
      - 手 を 挙げる {ところ だっ た} ん だ けど、別 の 人 が 質問 に 答え ちゃっ た。

        hint: 「～ようとする」 emphasizes the *attempt* or *intention*. We're looking for a phrase indicating
          being on the *verge* of an action, specifically when it's thwarted by another event.
    scene: You're in a classroom or a meeting, ready to contribute, when another participant beats you
      to it.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The phrase 「手 を 挙げる」 (te o ageru - to raise one's hand) signifies an intention to speak or
      answer. The casual 「答えちゃった」 (kotaechaitta) ending, derived from 「～てしまう」, conveys a sense of something
      happening quickly, often with a slight nuance of regret or disappointment because you missed the
      opportunity.
    etymology: The contracted form 「ちゃった」 originates from 「てしまう」. 「しまう」 implies completion, but when used
      with actions like this, it can also add a nuance of regret or something having happened inadvertently
      or too quickly, leaving the speaker feeling a certain way.
  - english: I almost said something I shouldn't have during the meeting.
    japanese:
      - 会議 中 に、言う べき じゃ ない こと を 言う {ところ だっ た}。
      - 会議 中 に、言う べき で は ない こと を 言う {ところ でし た}。

          - 会議 中 に、危ない こと を {言い そう に なっ た}。
        english: During the meeting, I almost seemed to say something dangerous.
        hint: 「～そうになる」 focuses on the *appearance* or *likelihood* of an action. We're looking for a phrase
          that expresses being at the *precise moment* of almost saying something, but pulling back.
    scene: After a tense and delicate work meeting, you reflect on a moment where you nearly spoke out
      of turn.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    nuance: 「言うべき じゃ ない こと」 (iu beki ja nai koto - something one shouldn't say) clearly indicates the
      sensitive or inappropriate nature of the unspoken words. This usage of 「ところだった」 conveys relief,
      highlighting an internal, self-controlled prevention of a potentially negative action.
    etymology: 「べき」 (beki) is a classical auxiliary verb indicating obligation or appropriateness. Its
      negative form 「べき じゃ ない」 emphasizes that the action was something that absolutely ought not to have
      been done, heightening the sense of a narrowly averted mistake.
  - english: I was just about to finish writing the report, but my computer crashed.
    japanese:
      - 報告 書 を 書き 終える {ところ だっ た} の に、パソコン が クラッシュ し た。
      - 報告 書 を 書き 終える {ところ でし た} の に、パソコン が クラッシュ し まし た。
    english_literally: Report to write finish was about to, but personal computer crashed.

        english: I tried to finish writing the report, but my computer crashed.
        hint: 「～ようとする」 indicates an *attempt* or *intention*. We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes
          being at the *very brink of completion* when an interruption occurred.
    scene: You've been working late on a critical report, almost done, when a technical disaster strikes.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The particle 「のに」 (noni) appended to 「ところだった」 strongly conveys a sense of regret, frustration,
      or disappointment. It highlights that despite being extremely close to completing the report, the
      unfortunate computer crash prevented its finalization.
    etymology: 「のに」 is a conjunctive particle often expressing contrast or an unexpected outcome, carrying
      a nuance of dissatisfaction or blame. It stems from the nominalizer 「の」 and the locative particle
      「に」, metaphorically placing the unexpected event 'in' the situation of the preceding clause.
  - english: I almost tripped over that step.
    japanese:
      - あの 段差 で 転ぶ {ところ だっ た}。
      - あの 段差 で 転ぶ {ところ でし た}。
    english_literally: That step at fall was about to.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 段差 で {転び そう に なっ た}。
        english: I almost seemed to trip over that step.
        hint: 「～そうになる」 implies the *appearance* or *likelihood* of an action. We're looking for a phrase
          that conveys being at the *exact point* of falling, with the implication of having averted it.
    scene: You're walking along, perhaps a bit distracted, and suddenly stumble, catching yourself at
      the last moment.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    nuance: This is a very common and direct use of 「ところだった」 for a physical near-miss. It typically conveys
      immediate relief at having averted a fall, often expressed with a sigh or an exclamation.
    etymology: 「段差」 (dansha) refers to a step or height difference. The verb 「転ぶ」 (korobu) means to fall
      or tumble. The combination with 「ところだった」 vividly paints the picture of being on the precipice of
      falling.
  - english: We were just about to reach the summit, but the weather suddenly changed.
    japanese:
      - 頂上 に 着く {ところ だっ た} の に、急 に 天気 が 変わっ て しまっ た。
      - 頂上 に 着く {ところ でし た} の に、急 に 天気 が 変わっ て しまい まし た。
    english_literally: Summit at arrive was about to, but suddenly weather changed.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 頂上 に {着こう と し た} が、天気 が 変わっ た。
        english: We tried to reach the summit, but the weather changed.
        hint: 「～ようとする」 focuses on the *attempt* or *intention*. We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes
          being at the *very edge of achievement* when an obstacle arose.
    scene: During a challenging mountain hike, your group is close to the peak when an unforeseen weather
      event forces you to turn back.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: Similar to the report example, the 「のに」 (noni) particle highlights the disappointment and
      frustration of being so close to achieving a goal, only for external circumstances (「急 に 天気 が 変わっ
      て しまっ た」 - the weather suddenly changed) to prevent it.
    etymology: 「頂上」 (choujou) means summit or peak. 「急 に」 (kyuu ni) means suddenly. The nuance of unfulfilled
      effort is strong here, a classic use of 「ところだった」 with 「のに」 for missed opportunities.
  - english: I almost went to buy that, but then I found it cheaper online.
    japanese:
      - それ を 買う {ところ だっ た} ん だ けど、ネット で もっと 安く 見つかっ た。
      - それ を 買う {ところ でし た} ん です が、ネット で もっと 安く 見つかり まし た。
    english_literally: That to buy was about to, but internet on more cheaply found.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ を {買おう と し た} けど、ネット で 安かっ た。
        english: I tried to buy that, but it was cheaper online.
        hint: 「～ようとする」 implies an *intention* or *attempt*. We're looking for a phrase that expresses
          being at the *point of making a purchase*, then finding a better option.
    scene: You're discussing a recent shopping experience with a friend, sharing a tip about finding a
      better deal.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This example showcases 「ところだった」 in a context where the averted action (buying something at
      a higher price) led to a positive outcome (finding it cheaper). The 「んだけど」 connects the near-action
      with the subsequent discovery, conveying satisfaction.
    etymology: 「ネット」 (netto) is a shortened loanword from English 'internet'. The expression 「見つかっ た」
      (mitsukatta - found) indicates that the discovery was somewhat unexpected but welcomed, perfectly
      fitting the 'almost but then' dynamic of this grammar point.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「ところだった」 is a powerful expression for conveying
  'almost' situations. It covers a wide range of emotions, from relief to regret, and can be used in various
  registers. Pay close attention to the context and surrounding adverbs or particles like 「危うく」 or 「のに」,
  as they often enhance the nuance of the 'near miss' or 'missed opportunity' that 「ところだった」 implies.
