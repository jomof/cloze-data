    "etymology": "The auxiliary verbs 「せる」 and 「させる」 are derived from older forms of causative verbs in classical Japanese. 「せる」 comes from 「しむ」 (shimu), and 「させる」 comes from 「しめさす」 (shimesasu), both meaning \"to cause to do.\" Over time, these evolved into the modern forms 「せる」 and 「させる」, retaining their causative meaning.",
    "writeup": "To express that someone was \"made to do\" or \"let do\" something, the auxiliary verbs 「せる」 and 「させる」 are used. This meaning is called 使役 (shieki), meaning \"causative\" or \"employment.\" It's important to understand that 「せる」 and 「させる」 are auxiliary verbs with their own meanings, similar to how 「たい」, 「ない」, 「だ」, and 「です」 each have their own meanings.\n\n**Conjugation Rules:**\n*   **る-Verbs:** Remove the final 「る」 and add 「させる」. (e.g., 食べる → 食べさせる)\n*   **う-Verbs:** Change the final kana to the corresponding あ-sound kana (except 「う」 becomes 「わ」), and then add 「せる」. (e.g., 読む → 読ませる, 買う → 買わせる)\n*   **する:** Becomes 「させる」.\n*   **来る:** Becomes 「来させる」 (こさせる).\n\n**Particle Usage Nuance:**\nWhen using causative verbs, either 「に」 or 「を」 can mark the **doer** of the action (the person who is *made* or *let* do something).\n\n*   **「に」:** Typically implies **allowing** or **letting** someone do something. This is often used with intransitive verbs. For example, 「先生が学生に本を読ませる」 (The teacher lets the students read books) suggests permission.\n*   **「を」:** Typically implies **making** or **forcing** someone to do something. This particle is used when the verb is intransitive and a stronger compulsion is implied. For example, 「母が子供を早く寝させる」 (My mother makes her child go to bed early) suggests a firm instruction. When the verb is transitive, the doer is usually marked by 「に」, and the object of the action is marked by 「を」.",

The intimate register, reflected by the general and inclusive 「皆 (みんな)」 (everyone), suggests a close bond with the listeners, suitable for a female speaker sharing heartwarming news. The use of 「を」 emphasizes the direct effect of the news on turning everyone into smiles.",
