    "etymology": "The word 「自分」 consists of 「自」 (ji), meaning \"self,\" and 「分」 (bun), meaning \"part\" or \"portion.\" Together, they create a word that signifies \"one's own part\" or \"oneself.\" Its evolution reflects a linguistic trend towards emphasizing personal agency or connection within a sentence.",
    "writeup": "「自分」 is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of a sentence or to the discourse topic. It translates to \"oneself\" or \"one's own.\" Importantly, its use often implies a degree of empathy or a personal connection from the speaker towards the subject. It is a versatile word and can be used in various registers, from casual conversations to more formal settings.\n\nConsider these points:\n\n*   When 「自分」 is used, it signals that the speaker is relating to the subject's perspective, almost stepping into their shoes.\n*   「自分」 can replace other pronouns like 「私」 or 「僕」, but it adds a nuance of introspection, self-reference, or emphasis on personal ownership.\n*   Unlike English reflexive pronouns (*myself, himself, etc.*) 「自分」 can often stand alone as the subject or object of a sentence, especially when referring back to the main subject of the clause.",
