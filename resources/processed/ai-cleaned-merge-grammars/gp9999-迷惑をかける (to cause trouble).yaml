jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Commonly used when apologizing for causing trouble, or when stating that someone or something
    is causing trouble. It implies an imposition on another's time, effort, or peace of mind.
  function: To express that one's actions, or the actions of another, have had an adverse or inconvenient
    effect on someone.
  nuance: Carries a sense of responsibility or acknowledgment of a burden placed on others. It can range
    from a minor inconvenience to a significant problem, depending on context and tone. It often conveys
    a feeling of apology or regret.
  grammatical-role: Transitive verb phrase, taking を to mark 迷惑 and sometimes に to mark the person/group
    affected.
  logical-flow: Action of 'causing' leads to a state of 'trouble' for someone.
etymology: The word 迷惑 (めいわく) is a noun meaning 'trouble,' 'annoyance,' or 'bother,' composed of 迷 (めい),
  meaning 'to be puzzled, astray,' and 惑 (わく), meaning 'to be confused, bewilder.' Together, they convey
  a state of being troubled or disoriented. かける (かける) is a verb with numerous meanings, but in this context,
  it functions similarly to 'to impose,' 'to inflict,' or 'to bring about' (as in 負担をかける 'to put a burden
  on,' or 手間をかける 'to cause effort'). Thus, 迷惑をかける literally means 'to impose or bring about trouble/annoyance.'
  The phrase highlights the act of creating a troublesome situation for another person.
writeup: |-
  The phrase 「迷惑をかける」 is a fundamental expression in Japanese, meaning 'to cause trouble,' 'to inconvenience,' or 'to annoy' someone. It is widely used in daily life, ranging from minor apologies for small inconveniences to more serious expressions of regret for significant problems caused. The nuance often depends heavily on the context, the speaker's tone, and the relationship between the speaker and the listener.

  This phrase inherently carries a sense of responsibility or acknowledgment that one's actions have imposed a burden on others. It is a cornerstone of Japanese communication, reflecting the cultural emphasis on not bothering others and maintaining harmony.

  While 「迷惑をかける」 is polite in its intent (to acknowledge an imposition), its formality can vary based on the accompanying verb forms (e.g., てすみません vs. て申し訳ございません). It is important to consider the recipient of the trouble; the affected party is often marked with the particle に. For instance, 「人に迷惑をかける」 (hito ni meiwaku o kakeru) means 'to cause trouble to people.'

  This phrase is versatile and can be used in various situations, whether you are apologizing for something you did, describing a situation where someone else caused trouble, or giving advice about avoiding causing trouble.
false_friends:
  - term: 困らせる
    meaning: to cause someone distress or difficulty; to bother or perplex someone
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both imply causing trouble, 「困らせる」 specifically focuses on making the other person feel
      troubled, distressed, or at a loss, often emotionally or mentally. 「迷惑をかける」 is broader and can refer
      to general inconvenience or annoyance, not necessarily leading to emotional distress.
    grammar_point: Verb[させる] (causative)
  - term: 邪魔をする
    meaning: to interrupt; to disturb; to hinder
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「邪魔をする」 specifically means to interfere with someone's action, progress, or peace, often by
      physically getting in the way or making noise. 「迷惑をかける」 is a more general term for causing any kind
      of inconvenience or annoyance, which may or may not involve direct interference.
    grammar_point: する (to do・make)
  - term: 面倒をかける
    meaning: to cause bother or nuisance; to impose trouble (often requiring effort)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「面倒をかける」 is very similar and often interchangeable with 「迷惑をかける」. However, 「面倒」 (mendou) more
      strongly implies that the trouble caused requires extra effort, time, or is troublesome to deal
      with. 「迷惑」 can refer to any form of inconvenience or annoyance, including those that don't necessarily
      require direct effort to resolve.
    grammar_point: Verb[dictionary] (dictionary form)
  - term: 負担をかける
    meaning: to place a burden (financial, physical, mental, etc.) on someone
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「負担をかける」 is more specific, referring to the act of putting a 'burden' or 'load' on someone,
      which could be financial, physical, or emotional. While a burden is a type of trouble, 「迷惑をかける」
      is a more general term for causing annoyance or inconvenience that might not be as heavy as a 'burden'.
    grammar_point: Verb[dictionary] (dictionary form)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing these expressions, consider the specific nature of the
  'trouble' being caused. If the trouble causes the other person to feel distressed or perplexed, use
  「困らせる」. If it involves direct interference or disruption of an activity, 「邪魔をする」 is more appropriate.
  For situations where the trouble necessitates extra effort or is cumbersome, 「面倒をかける」 might be a slightly
  better fit, although 「迷惑をかける」 often works as a general substitute. Finally, if the 'trouble' is specifically
  a responsibility or a load, opt for 「負担をかける」.
