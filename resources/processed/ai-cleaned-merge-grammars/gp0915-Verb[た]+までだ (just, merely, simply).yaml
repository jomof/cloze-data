    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「Verb[た]+までだ」 expresses that something was \"just\", \"merely\", or \"simply\" done. It's used to downplay the significance of an action, emphasizing that it was nothing special or extraordinary. It is similar to 「〜るまでだ」, but it uses the past tense (た) to indicate that the action has already occurred. This grammar is often used to modestly highlight that one only did the bare minimum, suggesting praising them is unnecessary.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This structure is primarily used in reference to one's own actions or the actions of a group they are affiliated with. You will not hear this form used to describe others' actions, as that could sound condescending.\n*   The phrase can be strengthened by adding 「までのことだ」 at the end, for additional emphasis.",
