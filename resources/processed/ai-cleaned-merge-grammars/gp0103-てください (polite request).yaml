jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: Used to politely request or instruct someone to perform or refrain from an action.
  nuance: While polite, it is a direct request. More deferential forms exist for higher levels of politeness.
  colocation: Commonly precedes actions that are beneficial to the speaker or listener, or general instructions.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a polite imperative auxiliary verb, modifying the preceding verb's te-form
    to create a command or request.
  temporal-flow: Requests an action to be performed in the present or immediate future.
  spatial-flow: Can imply actions related to physical movement or presence, e.g., 'Please come here.'
etymology: The Japanese grammar point 「ってください」 is formed from the te-form of a verb followed by 「ください」.
  The term 「ください」 itself is the polite imperative form of the verb 「くださる」 (kudasaru), which means "to
  give" in its honorific (sonkeigo) form. 「くださる」 is the respectful equivalent of the more common verb
  「くれる」 (kureru), also meaning "to give" (from the perspective of the speaker). Therefore, when you say
  「〜てください」, you are essentially making a polite request for someone to "give" you the action of the verb.
  This construction reflects a historical linguistic development where the act of someone performing an
  action for the speaker was conceptualized as 'giving' that action, and the imperative form of this 'giving'
  verb came to signify a polite command or request.
writeup: The grammar pattern **Verb te-form + ください** (ってください) is a fundamental expression in Japanese
  used to make polite requests or give polite instructions. It is most commonly translated as "please
  do (something)". For example, 「読んでください」 means "please read", and 「食べてください」 means "please eat". At its
  core, **ください** is the polite imperative form of the verb **くださる** (kudasaru), which is the honorific
  equivalent of **くれる** (kureru), both meaning "to give" (from the perspective of the speaker). Therefore,
  when you use 「〜てください」, you are essentially making a polite request for the listener to 'give' you the
  action of the verb. This construction makes it a highly versatile and commonly used polite expression
  in daily conversation. While **ってください** is polite, it is a direct request. For higher levels of politeness
  or to make a more indirect suggestion, other expressions like **〜ていただけませんか** might be used. **Important
  Considerations:** *   **Casual Usage:** In very casual conversation, especially among close friends
  or family, the **ください** portion can be omitted, leaving just the **て-form** of the verb (e.g., 「読んで」
  instead of 「読んでください」). This shortened form is highly informal and carries a very direct, sometimes slightly
  commanding, tone. Its appropriateness depends entirely on the relationship between speakers and the
  context. Using it with someone you don't know well or in a formal setting would be considered rude.
  *   **Negative Requests:** To politely ask someone *not* to do something, the negative **ないで-form**
  of the verb is used with **ください**. For example, 「食べないでください」 means "please don't eat", and 「行かないでください」
  means "please don't go". This is a common and important variation of the pattern.
false_friends:
  - term: な
    meaning: Do not, Don't (Prohibitive)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ってください」, which issues a polite request, 「な」 is a direct and forceful prohibition,
      used to tell someone definitively *not* to do something. It implies a strong command or warning,
      often carrying a harsh tone if used improperly.
    grammar_point: な (prohibitive particle)
  - term: ないで
    meaning: Without doing; Don't do (a request)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「ないで」 primarily functions as a conjunctive particle indicating simultaneous negative action
      or a preceding condition, e.g., 'without doing X'. It connects clauses rather than forming a direct
      request like 「ってください」, and is generally more casual if used as a request.
    grammar_point: ないで (without doing or don't)
  - term: お〜願う
    meaning: Please, Could you please
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「お〜願う」 is a highly formal or humble way to express a request. While similar in purpose to
      「ってください」, it typically conveys a greater degree of deference, often used when addressing superiors
      or in formal petitions, such as in business correspondence.
    grammar_point: お〜願う (polite request)
  - term: てごらん
    meaning: (Please) try to, (Please) look
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「てごらん」 suggests or encourages someone to try an action, often from a person in a supervising
      or elder role to a younger individual. It implies observation or experimentation, distinct from
      the direct request of 「ってください」, and carries a nuance of guidance or advice.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] + ごらん (gentle suggestion)
  - term: お〜ください
    meaning: Please do (Honorific)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「お〜ください」 is a more honorific and formal variation of 「ってください」, used to show heightened respect
      to the listener. It is common in business or customer service settings, such as 「お座りください」 (Please
      sit down), and implies a higher level of politeness and formality.
    grammar_point: お〜ください (polite request)
  - term: ていただけませんか
    meaning: Would you mind doing (humble request)?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ていただけませんか」 is a more indirect and humble way to make a request, typically used when addressing
      superiors or strangers. It asks if the listener *would be willing* to perform an action, making
      it more deferential and less demanding than the direct instruction of 「ってください」.
    grammar_point: Verb[て]+いただけませんか (humble request)
  - term: なさい
    meaning: Do (something)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「なさい」 is an imperative form used to give commands, typically by parents or teachers to children.
      While softer than a direct command like 「しろ」, it still carries more authority and less politeness
      than 「ってください」, and is generally not used among adults or equals.
    grammar_point: なさい (polite imperative)
  - term: Verb[て]
    meaning: Please do for me (Casual request)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: The plain 「て」 form of a verb can function as a casual request, but it is considerably less
      polite than 「ってください」. Its use is limited to very close relationships, such as with family or intimate
      friends, and can sound blunt or demanding outside these contexts.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] (casual request)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ってください」 serves as a direct, polite request, many similar expressions
  exist to convey nuances of formality, deference, or informality. For instance, more honorific forms
  like 「お〜ください」 or humble requests like 「ていただけませんか」 elevate politeness, while casual forms like the plain
  「て」 form are reserved for close relationships. Understanding these distinctions is key to using Japanese
  appropriately in diverse social contexts, ensuring your requests match the situation and your relationship
  with the listener.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 本 を 読み {なさい}。
        english: Read this book.
        hint: While still a command, 「なさい」 carries a stronger, more authoritative tone, often used by
          parents to children. We're looking for a standard polite request.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 本 を {お 読み ください}。
        english: Please read this book.
        hint: 「お〜ください」 is a more honorific form, implying higher respect, typically used in formal settings
          or when addressing someone of higher status. We're looking for a general polite request.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 本 を 読ん で {いただけ ませ ん か}。
        english: Would you mind reading this book?
        hint: This is a more indirect and humble request, asking for willingness. We're looking for a
          more direct, polite instruction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 本 を 読ん で {ごらん}。
        english: Try reading this book.
        hint: 「てごらん」 suggests trying an action or observing, not simply making a direct request to do
          it.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 本 を 読ん で {くれ ませ ん か}。
        english: Won't you read this book?
        hint: This is a polite way to ask for an action, but it sounds like asking a favor rather than
          giving a direct instruction from a parent.
    scene: A mother tells her child to read a book before bed.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「読んでください」 is a polite but firm instruction, commonly used by a parent to a child.
      The use of 'ください' ensures the request is understood as an instruction, not just a suggestion. While
      a plain 「読んで」 would be even more direct, 「読んでください」 maintains a level of politeness appropriate for
      a parent's gentle guidance.
    etymology: The word 「この」 'kono' originates from the Old Japanese demonstrative pronoun 「こ」 (ko), meaning
      'this or near the speaker', combined with the possessive particle 「の」 (no).
  - english: Please write your name here.

      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ に 名前 を 書き {なさい}。
        english: Write your name here.
        hint: 「なさい」 carries an authoritative, parental tone, which is generally not appropriate in a professional
          setting like a city office. We're looking for a polite and neutral instruction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ に お 名前 を {お 書き 願い し ます}。
        english: We kindly request you write your name here.
        hint: 「お〜願う」 is a highly formal and humble expression, often used for official requests or petitions.
          While polite, it's more deferential than a standard instruction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ に 名前 を 書い て {いただけ ませ ん か}。
        english: Would you mind writing your name here?
        hint: This is a more indirect and humble request, which is polite but less direct than a standard
          instruction given by a clerk.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ に 名前 を 書い {て}。
        english: Write your name here.
        hint: This is a casual command. In a professional setting, a polite instruction is required.
    scene: A clerk at a city office gives a form to a citizen, indicating where they should sign.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「書いてください」 is a standard polite instruction given in formal contexts like government offices
      or customer service, ensuring clarity and respect. The use of 'ください' is essential for maintaining
      professional courtesy when giving instructions to a customer or citizen. Using 「こちら」 and 「お名前」 further
      elevates the politeness, suitable for a formal business interaction.
    etymology: The term 「お名前」 'onamae' is a humble prefix 'お' (o-) combined with 「名前」 (namae) meaning
      'name', making it a polite way to refer to someone's name.
  - english: Please stop that conversation.
    japanese:
      - その 話 を やめ て {ください}。
      - その 話 は やめ て {ください}。
    english_literally: That conversation stop give.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 話 を やめ て {くれ}。
        english: Stop that conversation!
        hint: 「くれ」 is a highly informal and direct command. We're looking for a polite yet firm request
          in a social setting.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 話 を {やめろ}。
        english: Stop that conversation!
        hint: 「やめろ」 is a blunt, aggressive imperative. We're looking for a polite way to express discomfort
          and request an action to cease.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 話 を やめ て {いただけ ませ ん か}。
        english: Would you mind stopping that conversation?
        hint: This is a more indirect and humble request, which is polite but might sound less firm than
          the situation requires. We're looking for a firm yet polite request.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 話 を やめ {て}。
        english: Stop that conversation.
        hint: This is a casual command. While perhaps used among close friends, it lacks the politeness
          needed for a serious request in a social gathering.
    scene: A woman is uncomfortable with a sensitive topic being discussed at a social gathering and politely
      but firmly asks others to cease.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of 「やめてください」 conveys a strong desire for something to cease, while still maintaining
      politeness. This phrasing is effective when conveying seriousness or discomfort in a social setting
      where direct rudeness is to be avoided. It shows that the speaker is affected but still respectful.
      Using 「は」 (wa) instead of 「を」 (o) for the object emphasizes the topic of the conversation, making
      the request more specific and firm.
    etymology: The particle 「は」 (wa) has ancient origins, evolving from a topic marker in Classical Japanese.
      Its function here is to mark 'その話' (that conversation) as the topic of the speaker's concern, subtly
      contrasting it with other possible topics or actions. The particle 「を」 (o) is a direct object marker,
      indicating that 'その話' is the direct recipient of the action 'やめて' (stopping).
  - english: Please say it one more time.

        hint: This asks about willingness or capability. We're looking for a polite request for repetition
          from a student to a teacher.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 一 度 言っ {て}。
        english: Say it one more time.
        hint: This is a very casual command. When addressing a teacher, a more polite form is necessary.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 一 度 言っ て {いただけ ませ ん か}。
        english: Would you mind saying it one more time?
        hint: This is a more indirect and humble request, polite but perhaps less direct than a student's
          need for clarification. We're looking for a polite and clear request.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 一 度 言い {なさい}。
        english: Say it one more time.
        hint: 「なさい」 is an authoritative command, inappropriate for a student addressing a teacher. We're
          looking for a polite request.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 一 度 言っ て {くれ ませ ん か}。
        english: Won't you say it one more time?
        hint: This is a polite way to ask for an action, but it's an inquiry about willingness rather
          than a direct request for clarification.
    scene: A male student didn't quite catch what his female teacher said and politely asks for a repetition.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「言ってください」 is a common and polite way to ask for repetition or clarification, suitable for
      a learner or anyone needing information to be restated. The politeness of 'ください' is crucial when
      addressing someone in a position of authority, like a teacher. Adding 「すみません」 emphasizes the student's
      politeness and acknowledges that they are causing a slight inconvenience by asking for repetition.
    etymology: The phrase 「もう一度」 'mou ichido' combines 「もう」 (mou), meaning 'again' or 'already', and 「一度」
      (ichido), meaning 'one time'. 「すみません」 'sumimasen' originally derived from the verb 「済む」 (sumu),
      meaning 'to be finished' or 'to be settled', implying that the speaker's debt or fault is not yet
      settled, thus expressing apology or gratitude.
  - english: Please don't eat here.
    japanese:
      - ここ で 食べ ない で {ください}。

    english_literally: Here eat not give.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ で 食べる {な}。
        english: Don't eat here!
        hint: 「な」 is a very strong and blunt prohibition. We're looking for a polite way to inform someone
          of a rule.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ で 食べ {ない で}。
        english: Don't eat here.
        hint: While expressing negation, this form is casual and lacks the politeness required in a public
          setting when enforcing rules. We're looking for a polite negative request.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ で 食べ {て は いけ ませ ん}。
        english: You must not eat here.
        hint: This implies a strong prohibition or a strict rule. While often used for rules, 「ないでください」
          is a softer, more direct polite request to refrain from an action.
    scene: A male librarian kindly informs a young patron about the no-food policy in the reading area.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The 「ないでください」 form is essential for politely prohibiting an action, commonly used in public
      spaces like libraries or museums, where rules need to be communicated clearly but courteously. It
      allows the speaker to enforce a rule without sounding overly strict or aggressive. Using 「こちら」 instead
      of 「ここ」 adds a layer of formality and politeness, appropriate for a librarian addressing a patron
      in a formal setting.
    etymology: The demonstrative pronoun 「ここ」 (koko) means 'here' or 'this place'. 「こちら」 (kochira) is
      its more polite and formal counterpart, literally meaning 'this way' or 'this direction', often
      used to refer to a location or person in a respectful manner.
  - english: Please rest well.

      - competing_japanese:
          - ゆっくり 休ん で {くれ}。
        english: Rest well!
        hint: 「くれ」 is a highly informal and direct command. We're looking for a supportive and polite
          suggestion from a nurse to a patient.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ゆっくり 休み {なさい}。
        english: Rest well.
        hint: 「なさい」 carries a parental or disciplinary tone, which is generally not appropriate for a
          nurse advising a patient. We're looking for supportive and gentle advice.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ゆっくり 休ん で {いただけ ませ ん か}。
        english: Would you mind resting well?
        hint: This is a more indirect and humble request, which is polite but might sound less encouraging
          or advisory. We're looking for a supportive and polite instruction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ゆっくり 休ん {で}。
        english: Rest well.
        hint: This is a casual command. A nurse addressing a patient requires a more polite and respectful
          approach.
    scene: A female nurse tells an elderly patient to take it easy after a minor procedure.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: supportive
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「ゆっくり休んでください」 is a warm, polite suggestion often given to someone needing care or recovery.
      The use of 'ゆっくり' (slowly/well) combined with 'ください' provides a sense of genuine care and encouragement,
      often used by medical staff to patients. Adding 「どうぞ」 further emphasizes the sincerity of the encouragement,
      making the advice feel more welcoming and supportive.
    etymology: The adverb 「ゆっくり」 (yukkuri) means 'slowly' or 'at leisure'. 「どうぞ」 (douzo) is an interjection
      often used to offer something, encourage an action, or invite someone, implying a sense of hospitality
      or strong suggestion.
  - english: Please don't worry too much.
    japanese:
      - あまり 心配 し ない で {ください}。
      - どうぞ あまり 心配 し ない で {ください}。

    english_literally: Too much worry not give.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 心配 する {な}。
        english: Don't worry!
        hint: 「な」 is a very strong and blunt prohibition. We're looking for a gentle, polite request to
          ease someone's mind.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 心配 し {ない で}。
        english: Don't worry.
        hint: While expressing negation, this form is casual and might sound less empathetic or reassuring
          when offering comfort. We're looking for a polite, supportive request.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 心配 し {ない 方 が いい です よ}。
        english: It would be better not to worry.
        hint: This offers advice on what is preferable. We're looking for a direct, polite request to
          cease worrying.
    scene: A male friend tries to reassure his female friend who is overthinking things and worrying excessively.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: Using 「あまり心配しないでください」 is a common and kind way to comfort someone while gently requesting
      they cease an action. Even in a casual setting between friends, adding 「ください」 softens the request,
      making it sound more empathetic and less like a command. The adverb 「あまり」 (not much) further tempers
      the request, implying a gentle suggestion rather than a strict prohibition.
    etymology: The adverb 「あまり」 (amari) literally means 'too much' or 'not very' when used with a negative
      verb. In this context, it softens the negative instruction. The verb 「心配する」 (shinpai suru) means
      'to worry' and combines the kanji for 'heart' (心) and 'distribute/apportion' (配), suggesting a heart
      that is divided or scattered with anxiety.

        english: Excuse me, would you mind helping me with this luggage?
        hint: This is a more indirect and humble request, asking for willingness. We're looking for a
          slightly more direct, polite request for assistance.
      - competing_japanese:
          - すみ ませ ん、この 荷物 を 手伝っ て {くれる？}
        english: Excuse me, will you help me with this luggage?
        hint: This is a more casual question asking for willingness, less appropriate when addressing
          a stranger. We're looking for a polite request.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 荷物、手伝っ{て}。
        english: Help with this luggage.
        hint: This is a casual command lacking the politeness needed for a stranger interaction. We're
          looking for a polite request.
    scene: A female traveler at the airport, struggling with heavy luggage, politely asks a younger male
      passerby for help.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Using 「手伝ってください」 when asking a stranger for help is a standard polite request. The inclusion
      of 「すみません」 (excuse me/I'm sorry) at the beginning shows consideration for the listener's time and
      acknowledges that the speaker is imposing. This phrasing is direct enough to convey the need for
      help, while polite enough for a public interaction with someone you don't know.
    etymology: The word 「荷物」 (nimotsu) means 'luggage' or 'baggage'. The component kanji are 「荷」 (ni),
      meaning 'load' or 'burden', and 「物」 (mono), meaning 'thing'. 「手伝う」 (tetsudau) means 'to help' or
      'to assist', literally combining 「手」 (te), 'hand', and 「伝う」 (tsutau), 'to convey' or 'to transmit',
      implying lending a hand.

    japanese:
      - まず、野菜 を 小さく 切っ て {ください}。
      - 最初 に、野菜 を 小さく 切っ て {ください}。
      - この 野菜 を 小さく 切っ て {ください}。
    english_literally: First, vegetables small cut give.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - まず、野菜 を 小さく {切れ}。
        english: First, cut the vegetables into small pieces!
        hint: This is a blunt, direct command. We're looking for a clear, polite instruction suitable
          for a teaching environment.
      - competing_japanese:
          - まず、野菜 を 小さく 切る {べき です}。
        english: First, you should cut the vegetables into small pieces.
        hint: This offers advice on what is preferable. We're looking for a direct instruction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - まず、野菜 を 小さく 切っ て {いただけ ませ ん か}。
        english: First, would you mind cutting the vegetables into small pieces?
        hint: This is a more humble and indirect request, suitable if the instructor is asking a favor.
          We're looking for a direct instruction.
    scene: A male chef instructs a group of younger apprentices in a cooking class on how to prepare ingredients.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: In an instructional setting, 「切ってください」 functions as a clear and polite command. It provides
      direct guidance without being overly authoritative or rude. The adverb 「まず」 (first) sets the sequence
      of actions, and 「小さく」 (small) specifies the manner of cutting. This phrasing is typical for a professional
      guiding subordinates or students.
    etymology: The word 「まず」 (mazu) means 'first' or 'to begin with'. The adverb 「小さく」 (chiisaku) is derived
      from the i-adjective 「小さい」 (chiisai), meaning 'small', with the 'く' ending turning it into an adverb.
      「切る」 (kiru) means 'to cut'.
  - english: If you go to Kyoto, please try the local cuisine.
    japanese:
      - 京都 へ 行く なら、ぜひ 地元 料理 を 食べ て {ください}。
      - 京都 に 行く なら、ぜひ 地元 料理 を 食べ て {ください}。
      - もし 京都 へ 行く なら、ぜひ 地元 料理 を 食べ て {ください}。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 京都 へ 行く なら、地元 料理 を 食べ {なさい}。
        english: If you go to Kyoto, eat the local cuisine!
        hint: 「なさい」 implies a more authoritative suggestion, like a parent to a child, which isn't suitable
          between friends. We're looking for a friendly recommendation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 京都 へ 行く なら、地元 料理 を 食べ {て み て}。
        english: If you go to Kyoto, please try the local cuisine.
        hint: 「てみて」 specifically encourages 'trying out' an action. While similar, 「ってください」 here is a
          direct, polite recommendation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 京都 へ 行く なら、地元 料理 を 食べる {べき です よ}。
        english: If you go to Kyoto, you really should eat the local cuisine.
        hint: This implies a stronger obligation or advice on what is proper. We're looking for a polite,
          enthusiastic recommendation.
    scene: A female friend enthusiastically recommends local food to a male friend who is planning a trip
      to Kyoto.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: In this context, 「食べてください」 isn't a command, but a polite and strong recommendation, amplified
      by 「ぜひ」 (by all means/definitely). It encourages the listener to experience something enjoyable.
      This usage demonstrates how 「てください」 can convey suggestions or invitations in a friendly, enthusiastic
      manner, especially when the action is for the listener's benefit.
    etymology: The adverb 「ぜひ」 (zehi) originates from classical Chinese, meaning 'right and wrong', but
      evolved in Japanese to mean 'by all means' or 'without fail', indicating strong earnestness. 「地元料理」
      (jimoto ryōri) means 'local cuisine', combining 「地元」 (jimoto), 'local place', and 「料理」 (ryōri),
      'cooking/cuisine'.
  - english: Please give me your hand.
    japanese:

          in a specific situation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 手 を {貸せ}。
        english: Give me your hand!
        hint: This is a forceful, almost aggressive imperative, inappropriate for a supportive context.
          We're looking for a polite way to ask for help.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 手 を 貸し {なさい}。
        english: Lend me a hand.
        hint: 「なさい」 implies authority, typically from an elder to a child, which doesn't fit the supportive
          nature here. We're looking for a polite and encouraging request.
    scene: A kind teacher asks a hesitant child to give them their hand to help them over an obstacle.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: supportive
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「手 を 貸し て ください」 is a polite and direct request for assistance, often used when someone needs
      physical help. In this context, it's a gentle encouragement from a teacher to a child, reassuring
      them while asking for cooperation. The phrase implies trust and a willingness to help on the speaker's
      part.
    etymology: The phrase 「手 を 貸す」 (te o kasu) literally means 'to lend a hand', and is a common idiom
      in Japanese meaning 'to help' or 'to assist', literally combining 「手」 (te), 'hand', and 「伝う」 (tsutau),
      'to convey' or 'to transmit', implying lending a hand.

        english: Write slowly.

          child. We're looking for a polite instruction from a teacher.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ゆっくり 書い {て}。
        english: Write slowly.
        hint: This is a casual command. In a formal teaching environment, a polite instruction is more
          appropriate.
    scene: A calligraphy teacher tells a student to write more carefully and slowly.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「ゆっくり書いてください」 is a common instruction for tasks requiring precision or care, such as writing
      or drawing. The use of 「ゆっくり」 (slowly) combined with 「ください」 provides a gentle yet firm instruction.
      This phrasing is appropriate in an academic or instructional setting where clear guidance is needed
      while maintaining respect for the student.
    etymology: The adverb 「ゆっくり」 (yukkuri) implies 'slowly' or 'at ease', conveying a sense of unhurried
      action. The verb 「書く」 (kaku) means 'to write'.
  - english: Please try this cake, it's really delicious.

        hint: 「なさい」 is an authoritative imperative often used by adults to children. Here, we're looking
          for a polite and persuasive invitation to try something.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: Try eating this cake, it's really delicious!
        hint: 「てみて」 specifically encourages 'trying out' an action. While similar, 「ってください」 here is a
          more direct, polite invitation to partake.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ケーキ を 食べ {て}、本当 に 美味しい です よ。
        english: Eat this cake, it's really delicious!
        hint: The plain te-form used as a request is very casual and direct, potentially sounding impolite
          to elders. We're looking for a polite and persuasive invitation.
    scene: A young adult offers a slice of homemade cake to their hesitant grandparents.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: persuasive
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: This use of 「ってください」 is a polite encouragement or invitation, rather than a command. The addition
      of 「本当 に 美味しい です よ」 serves as a persuasive element, highlighting the benefit to the listener. The
      speaker, being younger, uses politeness to bridge the age gap, making the suggestion more palatable
      to their elders.
    etymology: 「本当 に」 (hontō ni) means 'truly' or 'really', emphasizing the speaker's conviction. 「美味しい
      です よ」 (oishii desu yo) combines the adjective 'delicious' with the polite copula and the sentence-ending
      particle 「よ」 which adds emphasis or provides new information.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「ってください」 adapts to various situations, from familial
  instruction to professional settings and expressions of concern. The choice of accompanying particles,
  adverbs, or introductory phrases can subtly adjust the tone, reflecting the speaker's intent and relationship
  with the listener. Understanding these nuances is crucial for effective communication in Japanese, allowing
  for politeness while conveying a clear request or instruction.
