grammar_point: てください (polite request)
learn_before:
  - どうぞ (here you are・please・invitation)
id: gp0103
meaning: please do something
pronunciation:
  katakana: テ クダサイ
  romaji: te kudasai
formation:
  Verb[te] + ください: Used to make a polite request or command.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The phrase combines the て (te) form of a verb, which connects clauses or indicates a means,
  with ください (kudasai), the imperative form of くださる (kudasaru), an honorific verb meaning "to give." Thus,
  it can be literally interpreted as "please give (the favor of) doing Verb." This etymology highlights
  the underlying nuance of the listener performing an action as a favor to the speaker.
writeup: The てください construction is one of the most fundamental and widely used ways to make a polite request
  in Japanese. It is formed by taking the て form of a verb and attaching ください. This structure directly
  asks or commands the listener to perform the action of the verb. Despite being classified as "polite,"
  it is essentially an imperative form. Its politeness comes from the use of ください, which is derived from
  くださる, an honorific verb indicating that the action is a favor bestowed by the listener upon the speaker
  or the speaker's in-group. Therefore, while suitable for most everyday polite interactions, particularly
  with people of equal or lower status, or with strangers where general politeness is required, it can
  sometimes feel a bit direct when addressing people of significantly higher status or in very formal
  business settings. In such cases, more indirect or humble expressions might be preferred. It's crucial
  to understand that てください is a direct request. The listener is expected to perform the action. It is
  not merely a suggestion or a casual inquiry.

  - term: てくれる
    meaning: to do for (me/us or in-group)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: てくれる describes an action someone has completed for the speaker's benefit, rather than requesting
      an action from the listener.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]くれる (to do for me・in-group)'
  - term: てほしい
    meaning: to want someone to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: てほしい expresses the speaker's desire for an action to occur, making it a softer, often more
      indirect request, whereas てください is a direct command.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]ほしい (to want someone to do)'
  - term: 〜なさい
    meaning: please do (polite imperative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While also a polite imperative, 〜なさい typically conveys a command from a superior to a subordinate
      (e.g., parent to child, teacher to student), making it less suitable for general polite requests
      than てください.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]なさい (polite imperative)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While てください is a versatile polite request, understanding its distinction from
  similar expressions is key. てくれる describes an action that someone has done for you, not a request for
  an action. てほしい expresses a wish or desire for an action to occur, which is softer and less direct than
  the command-like nature of てください. Lastly, 〜なさい is also a polite imperative, but its usage is generally
  restricted to situations where the speaker is in a position of authority over the listener, unlike てください
  which is more broadly applicable.

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate the versatility of てください in various situations. While always
  conveying a request or command, the specific nuance can shift based on context, the relationship between
  speakers, and accompanying particles or auxiliary verbs. For instance, 気をつけてください acts as a caring warning,
  while 教えてください is a direct plea for information. Combining てください with other verb forms like ておく (for
  preparatory actions) or てみる (for trying something) allows for more specific and nuanced requests.
