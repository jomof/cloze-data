        "Part of Speech": "な-adjective",
        "Register": "Generally used in casual to semi-formal contexts.",
        "Usage": "Indicates that one option is more desirable or acceptable than another, even if neither is ideal."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「まし」 comes from the verb 「増す (ます)」 meaning \"to increase\" or \"to improve.\" Over time, it evolved to describe something that is \"better\" or \"more desirable\" compared to something else. 「だ」 is the plain form copula.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ましだ」 is used to express that something is **better**, **preferable**, or **less objectionable** than something else. It implies a comparison where one option is considered more favorable, even if neither is perfect. It's similar to saying \"might as well\" in English.  It is often used with 「〜くらいなら」 to indicate that doing one thing is better than another. While not strictly formal, it’s versatile enough for various casual to semi-formal situations.",
