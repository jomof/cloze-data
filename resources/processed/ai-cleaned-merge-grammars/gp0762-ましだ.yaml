It implies a comparison where one option is considered more favorable, even if neither is perfect. It's similar to saying \"might as well\" or \"it's better than nothing\" in English. It is often used with 「〜くらいなら」 to indicate that doing one thing is better than doing another, typically when faced with undesirable alternatives. While not strictly formal, it’s versatile enough for various casual to semi-formal situations.",
