        "function": "Comparative judgment of preference or objectionability.",
        "nuance": "Often implies a sense of resignation or choosing the lesser of two evils."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「まし」 comes from the verb 「増す (ます)」 meaning \"to increase\" or \"to improve.\" Over time, it evolved to describe something that is \"better\" or \"more desirable\" compared to something else. 「だ」 is the plain form copula.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ましだ」 is used to express that something is **better**, **preferable**, or **less objectionable** than something else. It implies a comparison where one option is considered more favorable, even if neither is perfect. It's similar to saying \"might as well\" or \"it's better than nothing\" in English. It is often used with 「〜くらいなら」 to indicate that doing one thing is better than doing another, typically when faced with undesirable alternatives. While not strictly formal, it’s versatile enough for various casual to semi-formal situations.",
