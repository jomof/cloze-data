        "Register": "Generally used in informal settings.",
        "Part of Speech": "Adjective (な)",
        "Function": "Expresses that something is better or less objectionable than something else, even if it's not ideal.",
        "Related Expression": "いい (good)"

    "formation": {
        "ましだ": "Used directly to describe something as better.",
        "A より B の方がましだ": "B is better than A.",
        "Verb[dictionary form] くらいなら、Verb[other action] 方がましだ": "It's better to do [other action] than to [verb]."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「まし」 comes from the verb 「増す(ます)」 (masu), which means 'to increase' or 'to improve'. Therefore, 「ましだ」 implies a state that is 'more' or 'better' than another.",
    "writeup": "「ましだ」 (mashida) expresses that something is **better**, **preferable**, or **less objectionable** compared to something else. It doesn't mean something is *good*, but rather *not as bad* as the alternative. It often carries a nuance of resignation or acceptance of a less-than-ideal situation. It's similar to saying \"might as well\" in English. It functions as a な-adjective. Common patterns include 「A より B の方がましだ」 (B is better than A) and 「Verb くらいなら、other Verb 方がましだ」 (It's better to do X than Y).",
