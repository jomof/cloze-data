        "[Verb in ば-form] + いい": "Expresses that something would be good if (A) happens or that something should be done."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ばいい」 is formed by combining the conditional 「ば」 form of a verb with the adjective 「いい」 (good). Literally, it means 'if (A), it is good.' Over time, this structure has evolved to express advice, suggestions, and the idea that a certain action would lead to a desirable outcome.",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Standard"
    },
    "writeup": "「ばいい」 expresses a recommendation, suggestion, or the idea that something would be good if a certain condition were met. It is similar to saying \"should\" or \"it would be good if\" in English. This expression can also convey that performing a certain action is sufficient or the optimal course of action in a given situation.\n\nThis grammar point is generally used for offering advice or suggesting a solution. It is a relatively soft way of giving advice compared to stronger expressions. It is distinct from 「ばよかった」, which expresses regret about something that was not done.\n\nFurthermore, 「ばいい」 can be used when the speaker believes something is not possible, often paired with 「のに」. In these cases, it carries the nuance of \"despite it being good if it were (A)\", indicating that the speaker wishes for (A) but knows it cannot or will not happen.",
