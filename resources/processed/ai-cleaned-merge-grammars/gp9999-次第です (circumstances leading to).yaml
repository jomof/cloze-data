etymology: The word 「次第」 (shikai) originally referred to 'order,' 'sequence,' or 'program.' This foundational
  meaning evolved to encompass 'the way things progress' or 'the natural course of events,' leading to
  its use to express 'the circumstances' or 'it depends on.' The polite copula 「です」 is appended to add
  formality and politeness to this explanation of causality or progression.
writeup: |-
  「次第です」 is a formal and often somewhat stiff expression used to explain the *circumstances* or *reasons* that have led to a particular situation. It is commonly found in business communication, official statements, or situations where one needs to provide a clear, concise, and polite explanation for an outcome or decision, particularly when the situation is a natural or unavoidable consequence.

  This grammar point implies that the current state of affairs is the result of a chain of events or a logical progression, rather than a sudden or arbitrary occurrence. It is often used to convey a sense of 'that is just how things are' or 'it happened this way due to these factors.'

  Unlike other explanatory forms, 「次第です」 often carries a nuance of resignation or inevitability, suggesting that the speaker or entity involved is simply reporting the outcome of a process or circumstance beyond immediate control.

    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「わけだ」 is used when the speaker realizes or understands a logical conclusion based on prior
      information. It's often a personal realization. 「次第です」, on the other hand, is used to *explain*
      the circumstances or reasons to someone else, often implying a natural progression or an unavoidable
      outcome.
    grammar_point: わけだ (logical conclusion)
  - term: 〜のだ・〜んです (explanatory)
    meaning: It is that; the reason is
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「のだ・んです」 provides a general explanation, reason, or background information, often adding emphasis
      or seeking deeper understanding. It is widely applicable. 「次第です」 is more specific, focusing on the
      *circumstances* or the *sequence of events* that led to the current state, often with a more formal
      and somewhat final tone.
    grammar_point: 〜のだ・〜んだ (explanatory)
  - term: 〜ため(に) (because of・due to)
    meaning: Because of; due to; for the purpose of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ために」 explicitly states the cause or purpose of an action or situation. While 「次第です」 can also
      imply a cause, its focus is more on presenting the *current state as a result* of the circumstances,
      often implying a natural or unavoidable flow. 「ために」 is more direct about the causal link.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-casual・い-Adj・な-Adjな・Nounの]ため(に) (because of・due to)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions can be used for explanation, 「次第です」 uniquely emphasizes
  that the current situation is the result of a natural or logical progression of circumstances, often
  implying a degree of inevitability or a formal report of how things came to be. 「わけだ」 expresses a personal
  realization, 「のだ・んです」 provides a general background or reason, and 「ために」 points directly to the causal
  link. Choose 「次第です」 when you want to formally explain the 'way things are' due to a sequence of events.
