        "[Noun/Phrase] + が + 気になる": "Expresses interest or concern about something."

    "etymology": "The grammar point 「が気になる」 is derived from the noun 「気」 (ki), meaning 'spirit,' 'mind,' or 'feeling,' combined with the particle 「に」 and the verb 「なる」 (naru), meaning 'to become.' Therefore, it literally translates to 'something becomes of one's interest' or 'something becomes a concern.'",
    "writeup": "「が気になる」 expresses a state of being interested in or concerned about something. 「気」 refers to one's spirit, mind, or feeling, and 「になる」 means 'to become'. So, literally, something 'becomes of one's concern.' It is commonly used to express curiosity, worry, or a general interest in a topic, person, or situation.\n\n*   It indicates a natural inclination towards something, not necessarily a deliberate focus.\n*   It is often used to express mild interest or concern.\n*   This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts, from casual conversation to more formal settings.",

            "conjugation": "dictionary (plain non-past)",
            "nuance": "This sentence uses the plain form 「気になる」, which is common in casual conversation between friends or neighbors. The natural, almost involuntary, curiosity about 「隣の家の犬」 (the dog in the house next door) perfectly fits the nuance of が気になる, indicating something spontaneously drawing one's attention."

            "nuance": "Here, 「気になる」 conveys a sense of concern or anxiety about 「試験の結果」 (the exam results), reflecting the natural worry one might feel in such a situation. The serious nature of an exam makes the semi-formal register appropriate, even in plain form."
