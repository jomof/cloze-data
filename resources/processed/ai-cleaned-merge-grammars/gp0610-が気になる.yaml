        "usage-context": "It indicates a natural inclination towards something, not necessarily a deliberate focus. It is often used to express mild interest or concern. This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts, from casual conversation to more formal settings.",
        "function": "To express that something draws one's attention or becomes a concern.",
        "nuance": "Describes a passive, involuntary feeling of interest or concern, as opposed to an active, conscious decision.",

        "temporal-flow": "Describes a change in state where something comes to mind or begins to concern one."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「が気になる」 is derived from the noun 「気」 (ki), meaning 'spirit,' 'mind,' or 'feeling,' combined with the particle 「に」 and the verb 「なる」 (naru), meaning 'to become.' Therefore, it literally translates to 'something becomes of one's interest' or 'something becomes a concern.'",
    "writeup": "「が気になる」 expresses a state of being interested in or concerned about something. 「気」 refers to one's spirit, mind, or feeling, and 「になる」 means 'to become'. So, literally, something 'becomes of one's concern.' It is commonly used to express curiosity, worry, or a general interest in a topic, person, or situation. It indicates a natural inclination towards something, not necessarily a deliberate focus. It is often used to express mild interest or concern. This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts, from casual conversation to more formal settings.\n\nUnlike 「気にする」, which implies a more active and deliberate focus on something, often due to worry or concern, 「が気になる」 highlights that something is naturally becoming a focus due to the speaker's spontaneous interest or underlying concern. It is a more passive experience, where the external entity draws the speaker's attention.",
