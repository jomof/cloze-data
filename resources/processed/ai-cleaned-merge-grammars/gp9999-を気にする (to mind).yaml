    or letting something bother you).
  function: Expresses a mental state of concern or attention directed towards something.

  grammatical-role: Verb phrase
etymology: The phrase 「気になる」 (ki ni naru) literally means "something becomes a concern/feeling (in one's
  mind)". 「する」 (suru) is a transitive verb meaning "to do" or "to make." Thus, 「気にする」 (ki ni suru) means
  "to make something into a concern/feeling (in one's mind)," implying an active decision or a conscious
  act of letting something bother you or paying attention to it. The "気" (ki) here refers to one's spirit,
  mind, or feelings, a very broad concept in Japanese.
writeup: |-
  The phrase 「{を気にする}」 is used to express that one actively minds, cares about, or is bothered by something. It signifies a conscious act of directing one's attention or concern towards a particular matter, person, or opinion. This contrasts sharply with 「気になる」, which describes an *involuntary* feeling of concern, interest, or something simply coming to one's attention.

  When you 「{を気にする}」 something, you are *choosing* to let it affect you, whether positively (caring about details) or, more commonly, negatively (worrying about others' opinions, being bothered by noise). It can imply an overthinking tendency or being overly sensitive.

  Common applications include:
  *   **Caring about others' opinions**: 人の目を{気にする} (to care about what others think).
  *   **Being bothered by something**: 騒音を{気にする} (to be bothered by noise).
  *   **Paying attention to details**: 細かいことを{気にする} (to mind/care about small details).

  It's frequently used in negative sentences or questions, such as 「{気にしない}でください」 (Please don't mind/worry).

  **Important Considerations**:
  *   While 「{を気にする}」 can translate to "to worry," its nuance is often lighter than 「心配する」. 「心配する」 is about a deeper, more anxious kind of worry, whereas 「{を気にする}」 can be about smaller annoyances or social anxieties.
  *   The particle 「を」 marks the direct object of the verb 「気にする」, indicating what is being minded or cared about.

    meaning: to worry; to be anxious
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 心配する denotes a deeper, more anxious kind of worry, often about a future outcome or someone's
      well-being. {を気にする} can overlap in meaning with "to worry," but it often refers to being bothered
      by smaller things or caring about social perceptions.
    grammar_point: 心配する (to worry)
  - term: 構う
    meaning: to mind; to care; to interfere; to bother
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 構う is more emphatic and can sometimes carry a negative connotation of interfering or being
      overly concerned, especially in its negative form 「構わない」 (I don't mind). {を気にする} is generally neutral
      or slightly negative in tone, focusing on one's own internal state of mind.

  - term: 気に留める
    meaning: to pay attention to; to keep in mind; to take notice of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 気に留める emphasizes noticing something and consciously remembering it. It doesn't necessarily
      imply being bothered or worried, just paying attention. {を気にする} often implies that the thing being
      minded is a source of concern or bother.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:気に留める (to pay attention to)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「{を気にする}」, 「気になる」, 「心配する」, 「構う」, and 「気に留める」 all relate to one's mental
  state concerning something, understanding their subtle differences is key. 「気になる」 is an involuntary
  feeling, almost like "it comes to mind." 「{を気にする}」 is a conscious act of letting something affect you.
  「心配する」 is a deeper, more serious form of worry. 「構う」 implies a stronger engagement, sometimes intrusive,
  and is very common in polite negative forms like 「構いません」. Finally, 「気に留める」 means to notice and remember
  something, without necessarily implying worry or being bothered. Choose the phrase that best reflects
  the intentionality and emotional depth of your concern.
