    "etymology": "その (sono) means \"that\", and 結果 (kekka) means \"result\". Thus, その結果 (sono kekka) literally translates to \"that result\" or \"as a result of that.\"",
    "writeup": "**その結果 (sono kekka)** is a conjunction used to emphasize that something is a direct result of a previously stated matter. The noun **結果 (kekka)** itself means \"result\". This expression translates as \"as a result of (A)\" or \"resulting from (A)\".\n\n**その結果** is typically used at the beginning of a new sentence, clarifying that the subsequent phrase (B) is a clear consequence of the preceding statement (A). It can be applied to highlight both positive and negative outcomes interchangeably. However, the (B) part of the sentence almost always focuses on a new \"situation\" or \"condition\" that has arisen due to (A). It creates a strong cause-and-effect relationship between two distinct statements.",
