details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: Used to express strong dissatisfaction or a feeling of being unable to tolerate a situation.
    Often implies a resignation to an unavoidable, undesirable circumstance.
  function: Expresses that a situation, event, or condition is highly undesirable or unbearable for the
    speaker.
  nuance: Conveys a sense of exasperation, annoyance, or distress due to circumstances that are difficult
    to endure or overcome. It's stronger than simply 'disliking' something (～のは嫌だ) or finding it 'problematic'
    (～と困る), suggesting a level of physical or emotional toll.
  colocation: Often follows unpleasant or difficult conditions, actions (especially passive ones), or
    states.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a sentence-final expression or a clause-ending particle marking an unbearable
    condition.
  logical-flow: 'The first clause sets up the unbearable condition, and the second clause (implicitly
    or explicitly stated through 「てはかなわない」) indicates the speaker''s inability to endure it. There is
    a strong causal link: because of X, Y is unbearable.'
  temporal-flow: Describes an ongoing or habitual state/action that causes continuous exasperation, or
    a specific event whose occurrence renders a situation intolerable.
  spatial-flow: Not directly applicable, as this grammar point primarily expresses emotional or psychological
    states rather than physical movement or location.
etymology: The phrase 「てはかなわない」 combines the conjunctive particle 「て」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and
  the negative form of the verb 「叶う」 (kanau). The original meaning of 「叶う」 is "to be realized, to come
  true, to be granted (a wish)". Therefore, 「かなわない」 literally means "it does not come true" or "it cannot
  be realized." When paired with 「ては」, which introduces a condition, the overall expression conveys that
  "if this condition occurs, it cannot be realized/tolerated" or "it is unbearable." This evolution highlights
  how a verb related to 'realization' came to express 'unbearability' in a conditional context.
writeup: |-
  The grammar structure 「てはかなわない」 is used to convey that something is undesirable or unbearable. It combines the conjunctive particle 「て」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negative form of the う-verb 「叶う」 (kanau). While a literal interpretation might be "it's not a dream come true for (A)," the actual nuance implies that a situation is so intolerable it cannot be endured.

  When used with verbs, the verb is often in the passive form, indicating that the speaker does not like being the target or victim of the action. However, standard verb structures may also be used to describe undesirable ongoing situations or actions. This pattern emphasizes the speaker's personal experience of the negative circumstance.

  「てはかなわない」 can also follow the conjunctive form of い-adjectives (e.g., 暑くてはかなわない, atsukute wa kanawanai - "It's unbearable when it's hot") or appear as 「ではかなわない」 when following な-adjectives (e.g., 曖昧ではかなわない, aimai de wa kanawanai - "It's unbearable when it's vague").

  This expression is generally gender-neutral and widely used across different age groups in standard Japanese. It conveys a strong personal feeling of exasperation.

  **Important Consideration:**
  While many grammar structures frequently appear in hiragana, making their original kanji hard to identify, it's important not to confuse 「叶う」 (to grant/realize) with 「敵う」 (to be a match for). Grammatically and semantically, these verbs are used quite differently, despite their similar sound.

  - term: ～てならない
    meaning: cannot help but feel; cannot help but do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「てはかなわない」, which expresses something is unbearable due to an external situation, 「てならない」
      indicates an uncontrollable, often strong, internal feeling or emotion (e.g., 嬉しくてならない - 'I can't
      help but feel happy'). It doesn't typically convey unbearableness in the same way, focusing more
      on internal states rather than external conditions.
    grammar_point: てたまらない・てならない・て仕方がない・てしょうがない (unbearably・cannot help but)
  - term: ～てたまらない
    meaning: unbearably; cannot help but feel
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「てたまらない」 also expresses an intense feeling that is difficult to control or bear, it
      often focuses on a strong, overwhelming sensation or desire (e.g., 眠くてたまらない - 'I'm unbearably sleepy,'
      食べたくてたまらない - 'I can't wait to eat'). 「てはかなわない」, however, usually emphasizes the difficulty in enduring
      an external situation, condition, or action that causes distress, rather than an internal sensation
      or desire.
    grammar_point: てたまらない・てならない・て仕方がない・てしょうがない (unbearably・cannot help but)
  - term: ～にかなう
    meaning: to suit; to fit; to satisfy
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「にかなう」 means 'to suit,' 'to conform to,' or 'to satisfy,' implying a positive fit or fulfillment
      (e.g., 期待にかなう - 'to meet expectations'). This is the direct opposite of 「てはかなわない」, which expresses
      an inability to endure or that something does not fit/is not satisfactory, thus highlighting their
      contrasting meanings derived from the root verb 「叶う」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:にかなう (to suit, to satisfy)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「てはかなわない」 expresses a sense of being unable
  to tolerate or bear something due to its negative impact, often from an external circumstance. In contrast,
  「てならない」 indicates an uncontrollable internal emotion, while 「てたまらない」 signifies an intense, overwhelming
  internal sensation or desire. Lastly, 「にかなう」 means something suits or satisfies a need, which is the
  complete opposite of the sentiment expressed by 「てはかなわない」. Pay attention to the specific type of 'unbearability'
  or 'intensity' being conveyed to choose the correct expression.

        english: I hate riding crowded trains every day.

          an expression that implies a higher level of intolerance or exasperation.
    scene: A man arrives home after a long day, complaining to his roommate about his daily commute, indicating
      a deep, persistent discomfort.
    register: casual

    nuance: The phrase 「乗って はかなわない」 clearly conveys the speaker's deep, chronic frustration with the daily
      commute. The use of 「毎日」 emphasizes the ongoing nature of the unbearable situation.

          - こんな に 暑い と {困る}。
        english: It's troublesome if it's this hot.
        hint: This expresses inconvenience or trouble, but not the deep physical or emotional toll of
          'unbearable' that is conveyed by 「てはかなわない」. We're looking for an expression of utter intolerance.
    scene: A person sweating profusely indoors during a summer heatwave, fanning themselves vigorously,
      clearly struggling with the temperature.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: The expression 「暑くて はかなわない」 captures the intense physical discomfort and the feeling of being
      overwhelmed by the heat. This is a common lament during Japan's humid summers.

      of heat and fever.

          - 彼 の 話 は いつ も 曖昧 で {理解 し にくい}。
        english: His explanations are always vague and difficult to understand.
        hint: This expresses difficulty in understanding, not the strong exasperation or inability to
          tolerate the situation that 「てはかなわない」 implies. We're looking for a statement about an unbearable
          situation, not just a difficult one.
    scene: A student complains to a classmate about a professor's unclear lectures, which make it difficult
      to understand the material and are deeply frustrating.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: Here, 「曖昧で はかなわない」 conveys exasperation with the persistent lack of clarity. It implies that
      the vagueness makes understanding or progress impossible, causing significant frustration for the
      speaker.
    etymology: 曖昧 (aimai) combines characters for 'dark' (曖) and 'not clear' (昧), inherently meaning unclear,
      vague, or ambiguous.

        english: It's painful to be woken up by my child in the middle of the night.
        hint: This conveys difficulty or suffering, but 「てはかなわない」 emphasizes a deeper, almost unmanageable
          level of distress or resignation. We're looking for an expression of something being intolerable,
          not just painful.
    scene: A tired mother confides in a friend during a playdate about her persistent lack of sleep due
      to her child, expressing deep exhaustion.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: This expression, particularly with 「起こされ ては」 (passive form, meaning 'being woken up'), strongly
      conveys the mother's honest feeling of being unable to endure the fatigue of childcare any longer.
      The passive form emphasizes that her sleep is disturbed against her will, a sentiment often deeply
      relatable for women who are mothers, as it highlights the overwhelming nature of parenting challenges.
    etymology: 夜中 (yonaka) literally means 'middle of the night', a common term used to describe the late
      hours when most people are asleep.

        english: Changing specifications right before the deadline is extremely tough.

          of being overwhelmed and utterly unable to tolerate the situation, rather than just tough.
    scene: A software engineer explains the difficulties and pressure of a demanding project to a senior
      colleague in a professional setting, stressing the unmanageable stress.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: serious
    nuance: The phrase 「厳しくて はかなわない」 in this business context expresses a strong professional grievance,
      highlighting that the situation is so difficult it's no longer tolerable or manageable. The term
      「納期」 (nouki) is frequently used in business for 'delivery date' or 'deadline', often replacing the
      more general 「期限」 (kigen) for emphasis on project management.

      common term in software development and project management.

        english: This job has too much overtime and I get tired.
        hint: This expresses fatigue as a consequence, whereas 「てはかなわない」 conveys that the excessive overtime
          itself is intolerable. We're looking for the sense of an unmanageable situation.
    scene: A young employee talks to themselves after another long day at work, feeling exhausted and
      defeated by the endless demands.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The phrase 「残業 が 多 すぎ てはかなわない」 (having too much overtime is unbearable) expresses a man's
      personal lament or resignation towards the harshness of his work. The phrase 「多 すぎ て」 ('too much')
      further emphasizes the unbearable situation, often used in situations where one is lamenting their
      current state to themselves or to a very close confidante, highlighting a sense of personal burden.
    etymology: 残業 (zangyō) means 'overtime work'. It combines 残 (zan, remaining) and 業 (gyō, business/work),

        english: He often interrupts people, so it's annoying.
        hint: This expresses annoyance, but not the deep exasperation and inability to tolerate the behavior
          that 「てはかなわない」 implies. We're looking for a stronger sense of being unable to stand something.
    scene: Two friends discussing an annoying mutual acquaintance who has a habit of cutting others off
      mid-sentence, expressing their intense annoyance.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The use of 「遮っ ては かなわ ない」 clearly articulates the speaker's deep annoyance and frustration
      with the repeated behavior. This level of 'unbearableness' is often expressed when a situation is
      not just inconvenient but actively disrupts social interaction.
    etymology: 遮る (saegiru) means 'to interrupt' or 'to obstruct'. The character 遮 implies blocking or
      covering.

        english: Because of my dust allergy, my nose is itchy every day, and it's tough.
        hint: This describes the situation as difficult, but 「てはかなわない」 conveys a stronger sense of chronic,
          overwhelming physical discomfort that is hard to endure. We're looking for a feeling of something
          being intolerable.
    scene: A person complains about their chronic dust allergy symptoms, which are particularly bad during
      spring, to a sympathetic family member, expressing deep discomfort.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: The polite form 「痒くて はかないません」 is used here, showing respect to the sympathetic family member,
      while still conveying the speaker's deep, daily discomfort. The phrase emphasizes that the itchiness
      isn't just an inconvenience, but a constant, overwhelming irritation.
    etymology: 埃 (hokori) means 'dust'. アレルギー (arerugii) is a loanword from English 'allergy', commonly
      used in Japanese.

        english: It's troublesome that the neighbor's dog barks all night.
        hint: This expresses simple trouble or inconvenience, not the strong feeling of being unable to
          tolerate or endure the situation. We're looking for an expression that implies a higher level
          of exasperation and resignition.
    scene: A student confides in a friend over coffee about their difficulty sleeping due to a noisy neighbor.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: passive (～られる/～かれる)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female

      involuntary suffering due to an external disturbance. This is a common complaint in urban living.

    english_literally: Because of one person's mistake, everything becoming a redo, it cannot be realized
      (it's unbearable).

        english: I dislike having to redo everything because of one person's mistakes.
        hint: This expresses a personal dislike. We're looking for a stronger sense of being overwhelmed
          and unable to tolerate a situation that impacts others. Consider the broader negative impact
          this situation has.
    scene: A project manager expresses deep frustration to a team member during a private discussion about
      recurring errors causing significant delays.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: serious
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「なって は かなわ ない」 highlights the unacceptability of the situation in a professional
      context, implying that such mistakes are not just inconvenient but actively hinder productivity
      and morale. This use is common when expressing frustration about a recurring, systemic problem within
      a team.
    etymology: やり直し (yarinaoshi) means 'redo' or 'restart'. It combines 「やり」 (doing) and 「直し」 (fixing/revising).
post_example_writeup: The examples demonstrate the wide variety of situations where 「てはかなわない」 can be used
  to express that something is undesirable or unbearable. This includes physical discomfort (e.g., heat,
  itching), psychological frustration (e.g., vagueness, interruptions), and overwhelming circumstances
  (e.g., crowded trains, excessive overtime). The consistent nuance across these examples is the speaker's
  feeling of being unable to tolerate or cope with the situation, often implying a sense of helplessness
  against it.
