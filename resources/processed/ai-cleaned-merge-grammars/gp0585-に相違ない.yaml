    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「に相違ない」 is a combination of 「に」 (a particle indicating state or result), 「相違(そうい)」 (meaning \"difference\" or \"discrepancy\"), and 「ない」 (meaning \"not\"). Literally, it translates to \"there is no difference/discrepancy (in that)\", which conveys the meaning of \"without a doubt\" or \"certainly.\" This construction emphasizes the absence of any conflicting information or possibility, leading to a strong assertion of truth.",
    "writeup": "「に相違ない」 is a grammatical structure used to express a strong conviction or certainty that something is true or will happen. It conveys the meaning of \"without a doubt,\" \"certainly,\" or \"surely.\" This expression is employed when the speaker has compelling reasons or evidence to believe in the truth of a statement, leaving no room for alternative possibilities.\n\nThis grammar point is highly formal and is typically found in written language, academic papers, legal documents, or formal speeches. In casual conversation, the similar but less formal expression 「に違いない」 (ni chigainai) is almost always preferred. While both convey strong certainty, 「に相違ない」 carries a more definitive and objective tone, often implying that the conclusion is reached through logical deduction or undeniable facts.\n\n「に相違ない」 can follow verbs in their plain form, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (dropping the な), and nouns. It often appears after a phrase explaining the reason for the certainty, frequently marked by 「から」, highlighting the cause from which the undeniable conclusion is drawn.\n\n**Usage Notes:**\n*   **Verbs**: Attach directly to the plain form (dictionary, negative, past, or negative past).\n    例： 彼 は 来る {に 相違ない}。(He will certainly come.)\n*   **い-Adjectives**: Attach directly.\n    例： それ は 正しい {に 相違ない}。(That is certainly correct.)\n*   **な-Adjectives**: Remove な before attaching.\n    例： 彼 の 判断 は 的確 {に 相違ない}。(His judgment is certainly accurate.)\n*   **Nouns**: Attach directly.\n    例： 彼 が 犯人 {に 相違ない}。(He is certainly the culprit.)\n\nDue to its formality, using 「に相違ない」 in casual settings can sound overly stiff or even condescending.",
