    "writeup": "「に相違ない」 is a formal grammar point used to express strong certainty or conviction about something. It conveys the meaning of \"without a doubt,\" \"certainly,\" or \"surely.\" It's similar to 「に違いない」, but 「に相違ない」 is considered more formal and is often used in written language or formal speech. The literal meaning reflects the idea that there is 'no discrepancy' in the speaker's judgment or belief. It's often used to strengthen one's own opinions or to strongly agree with someone else's. It can be used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns.",
