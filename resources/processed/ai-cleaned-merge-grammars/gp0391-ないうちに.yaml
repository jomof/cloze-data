        "usage-context": "General usage, emphasizing prevention of negative outcomes or action taken before an undesirable state develops.",
        "nuance": "Implies a sense of urgency or caution to act before an undesirable situation or event occurs. The focus is on avoiding a negative consequence if no action is taken."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「うちに」 literally means \"within\" or \"while inside.\" When combined with the negative form of a verb, 「ない」, it creates the nuance of taking action or a change occurring before a certain negative event or state comes to pass. It emphasizes the importance of acting promptly to prevent an undesirable outcome. The underlying idea is to utilize the period *before* something bad happens.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ないうちに」 is used to express an action that should be taken, or a state that exists, **before** a certain undesirable situation or event occurs. It contrasts sharply with 「うちに」 without the negative, which often implies an *optimal* or *best* time for something to happen. In contrast, 「ないうちに」 specifically highlights a time during which something *has not yet occurred* or *does not happen*, often implying that if action is not taken, a negative consequence will result. This structure can be translated as \"before (A) happens, (B)\" or \"without (A) happening, (B)\", where (B) is either an action taken to prevent (A), or an unfortunate event that transpired because (A) was not addressed. The key nuance is the prevention of, or occurrence due to, an **unfavorable result**.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「ないうちに」, 「うちに」 without the negative form is used to express actions or changes that occur within a specific time period, often implying a positive or neutral context or an opportune moment."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To distinguish, use 「ないうちに」 when you need to emphasize taking action before something negative happens or before a certain undesirable state arises. If you are merely stating that something happens prior to another event in sequence, 「前に」 is sufficient. For actions or changes occurring within a general time frame or an opportune moment, 「うちに」 is the appropriate choice.",
