jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: general
  nuance: Often implies a level that is surprising, unexpected, or directly reactive to a perceived situation.
etymology: 「そんなに」 is derived from 「そんな」, which itself is a contraction of 「そう」 (like that) and the attributive
  particle 「な」. The addition of 「に」 turns it into an an adverb, indicating the degree to which something
  is like that.
writeup: |-
  「そんなに」, like 「そんな」, is a common way to express that something is "like" something else. The addition of the particle 「に」 highlights 「そんな」 as being the "destination" of the "like" amount. This construction is regularly translated as "so much", "that much", or simply "like that."

  As a word, 「そんなに」 is used adverbially, so it may come before any verb, い-adjective, or な-adjective. Almost any 「そんなに」-based sentence can be translated literally as "to an extent like (A)," where (A) is the word that comes after 「そんなに」, and 「に」 indicates "to."

  As 「そんなに」 is another example of こそあど言葉 (words like 「これ」, 「それ」, 「あれ」, and 「どれ」), it means that 「こんなに」, 「あんなに」, and 「どんなに」 may also be used. Despite this, 「そんなに」 is almost considered a set phrase and is therefore the most common out of all the possibilities (except for 「どんなに」, which is often used when explaining or giving reasons for something).

    meaning: Not very, Not much, Not really, Hardly

  - term: そんな・こんな・あんな・どんな
    meaning: Such a, Kind of, Something like ~
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「そんな」 (and its counterparts) are adjectival, modifying nouns (e.g., 「そんな 人」 - 'such a person'),
      whereas 「そんなに」 is an adverb, modifying verbs and adjectives to indicate degree (e.g., 「そんなに 速い」
      - 'that fast').

  - term: とても
    meaning: Very
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とても」 simply indicates a high degree, whereas 「そんなに」 (especially with negation or in questions)
      often implies a level that is surprising or unexpected by the speaker. For example, 「そんなに 疲れていない」
      means 'not *that* tired (as you might think)', while 「とても 疲れていない」 would sound unnatural or like
      'not very tired'.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:とても (very)
  - term: それほど
    meaning: To that extent; so much
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「それほど」 and 「そんなに」 are often interchangeable. However, 「そんなに」 tends to be more conversational

      slightly more formal or used for a more objective statement of degree.

    meaning: This much, so much, like this
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「そんなに」 refers to a degree related to something *distant* or *indirectly perceived* (that

      (this much).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:こんなに (this much)
  - term: あんなに
    meaning: That much over there, so much, like that over there
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「そんなに」 refers to a degree related to something *distant* or *indirectly perceived* (that
      much), 「あんなに」 refers to a degree related to something *far from both speaker and listener* or *recalled
      from memory* (that much over there).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:あんなに (that much over there)
  - term: どんなに
    meaning: How much, to what extent
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どんなに」 is used in questions or exclamations to ask/emphasize 'how much/to what extent', whereas
      「そんなに」 is a statement or response about 'that much' degree.
    grammar_point: どんなに (exclamatory how much)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  To avoid confusion, remember that 「そんなに」 is an adverb, used to modify verbs and adjectives and describe the *extent* or *degree* of something, often implying surprise or reaction. For example, "It's not *that* expensive," or "Don't eat *so* much!"
  「そんな」, and its counterparts 「こんな」, 「あんな」, 「どんな」, are adjectival and modify nouns.
  「あまり～ない」 is used to express a lower degree or frequency, often in negative contexts.
  While 「とても」 also indicates 'very' or 'a high degree', 「そんなに」 often carries a nuance of responding to a perceived or expected level. For instance, 「そんなに 疲れていない」 (I'm not *that* tired) implies less tiredness than someone might assume, whereas 「とても 疲れていない」 could sound unnatural or simply mean 'not very tired'.
  「それほど」 is very similar to 「そんなに」 and often interchangeable, but 「そんなに」 is generally more colloquial and reactive, used in direct responses to observable situations, while 「それほど」 can be slightly more neutral or formal.
