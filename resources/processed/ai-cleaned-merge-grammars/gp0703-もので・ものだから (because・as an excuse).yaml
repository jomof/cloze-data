jlpt: N3
etymology: The origin of 「もので・ものだから」 can be traced to the nominalizer 「もの」 (thing/fact) followed by the
  particle 「で」 (being/cause) or the conjunctive form 「だから」 (because). Historically, 「もの」 emphasizes the
  'fact' or 'reason' behind something, lending the phrase its explanatory nature. The inclusion of 「だ」
  (copula) in 「ものだから」 adds a declarative, slightly more emphatic tone to the reason, which can then be
  interpreted as a more direct excuse. It essentially frames the preceding statement as 'it is because
  of this *fact* that...', making the reason sound self-evident or unavoidable.
writeup: |-
  The grammar patterns 「もので」 and 「ものだから」 are used to provide reasons or explanations, often carrying a nuance of justification or excuse. They convey that the preceding statement is the cause or reason for what follows, and that this reason is perceived as somewhat inherent, unavoidable, or a given fact. While both forms serve a similar purpose, 「ものだから」 tends to be a more direct and sometimes stronger way of stating an excuse, which can occasionally sound a bit demanding if not used carefully.

  These expressions are typically attached to the plain form of verbs, i-adjectives, and na-adjectives (with 「な」), and nouns (with 「な」). They are commonly used in daily conversation when explaining why something happened or why a certain action was taken. They suggest that the speaker is presenting a reason that they believe the listener should understand or accept.

  For example, if you are late, you might say 「電車が遅れたもので (densha ga okureta monode)」 or 「電車が遅れたものだから (densha ga okureta monodakara)」 to explain your tardiness. The choice between 「もので」 and 「ものだから」 can depend on the desired level of emphasis on the excuse or the formality of the situation. 「もので」 can feel slightly more formal or objective in stating a reason, while 「ものだから」 is more conversational and can explicitly plead for understanding.
false_friends:
  - term: から (reason cause)
    meaning: Indicates a reason or cause.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「から」 also states a reason, it is a more general and neutral connector without the inherent
      nuance of an excuse or justification often found in 「もので・ものだから」. It simply states 'because'.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]から (because・so)'
  - term: ので (reason)
    meaning: Indicates a reason or cause in a softer, often more polite tone.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ので」 provides a reason that sounds more objective and less like a direct excuse compared to
      「もので・ものだから」. It's often used when you want to soften a statement or make it sound less direct.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]から (because・so)'
  - term: ことだから (given the nature of)
    meaning: Given the nature of (A), (B) is to be expected; Precisely because it is (A), (B).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ことだから」 is used to state an expected outcome based on the inherent nature or typical behavior
      of a person or thing. Unlike 「もので・ものだから」, which explains a specific instance, 「ことだから」 generalizes
      about a characteristic.
    grammar_point: ことだから (given the nature of)
  - term: ため・ために (for the purpose of・because of)
    meaning: For the purpose of; in order to; for the sake of; because of; due to.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ため」 is more formal and primarily indicates a cause or purpose, often for objective or formal
      reasons. It does not carry the connotation of an 'excuse' like 「もので・ものだから」 does, and can indicate
      both cause and purpose.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary・Nounの]ために (for the purpose of)'
  - term: せい (because of・blame)
    meaning: Because of, Due to, Blame.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「せい」 is used to state a reason, but it almost always carries a negative nuance, implying that
      the cause is to blame for the result. This contrasts with 「もので・ものだから」, which seeks understanding
      rather than assigning blame.
    grammar_point: 〜おかげで・〜せいで (because of, positive・negative result)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between these expressions, consider the nuance you wish to convey.
  If you are simply stating a fact or a general reason, 「から」 or 「ので」 are good choices. If you are providing
  a reason that explains your personal circumstance or justifies your action, often implicitly seeking
  understanding or leniency, 「もので・ものだから」 are more appropriate. 「ものだから」 puts more direct emphasis on the
  'because' and can sound more like an explicit excuse. On the other hand, if you are predicting an outcome
  based on someone's established character, use 「ことだから」. For formal or objective causation, or to state
  a purpose, 「ため」 is suitable. And if you intend to place blame, 「せい」 is the correct choice, but be aware
  of its strong negative implication.

        english: I couldn't sleep last night because I was excited.
        hint: 「から」 simply states a reason, without the nuance of an excuse that 「ものだから」 or 「もので」 often

          circumstance.

        english: I couldn't sleep last night as I was excited.
        hint: 「ので」 gives a reason in a softer, more objective tone. We need a phrase that conveys a personal
          reason or a mild excuse.

    register: casual

    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional

          - まだ 初心 者 です から、色々 教え て ください。
        english: Since I'm still a beginner, please teach me a lot.
        hint: 「ですから」 is a general polite conjunctive for 'therefore' or 'so'. While correct, it lacks

          that 「もので」 conveys.
    scene: Someone new to a club or activity is asking for guidance.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional

        hint: 「なので」 is a simple connective particle for reasons, but it doesn't carry the natural, slightly

    scene: A person about to give their first presentation.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: This use of 「ものだから」 provides an immediate, personal explanation for the speaker's nervousness,

    register: casual

post_example_writeup: 'These examples demonstrate how 「もので・ものだから」 are used to present a reason or cause
  in a way that suggests it''s a natural consequence or an unavoidable circumstance, often implicitly
  seeking understanding or leniency from the listener. The choice between 「もので」 and 「ものだから」 often depends
  on the speaker''s intent: 「ものだから」 provides a more direct, sometimes emphatic, reason or excuse, while
  「もので」 can be a slightly softer or more generally explanatory tone.'
