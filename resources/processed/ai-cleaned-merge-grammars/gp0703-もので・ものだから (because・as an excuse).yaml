    usage-context: Common
  etymology: This grammar point combines もの, which adds emphasis, with です for politeness, and から, meaning
    "because." The shortened form もので drops から but implies a continuing explanation.
  writeup: ものですから and its slightly more informal variant もので function as emphatic connectors that provide
    a reason or explanation, akin to "because" or "the reason is." They convey a sense of **firmness or
    justification** for the preceding statement, often implying that the reason is self-evident or unavoidable.
    This grammar point builds upon the basic causal particle から, with もの (from 物 or 者, though here it functions
    as a nominalizer/emphasizer) adding a layer of emphasis to the causal relationship. The shortened form
    もので or the even more casual もんで retains the core meaning. The change from から to で signifies a continuation,
    indicating that the explanation is leading to a consequence or further statement, even if that subsequent
    part is omitted. While ものだから is very similar and often interchangeable, ものですから tends to be used when
    a slightly more polite or formal emphasis is desired, often in situations where one is providing an
    **excuse or a clear justification** for one's actions or a situation. It subtly signals, "This is the
    reason, and you should understand it." This structure is particularly useful when you want to provide
    a **concrete, perhaps slightly apologetic or self-justifying, reason** for something. It's not just
    a neutral statement of cause and effect; it often implies that the speaker *had* to do something or
    *is* in a certain state because of the reason given. It can soften a statement by presenting the reason
    as an unavoidable circumstance.
  false_friends:
    - term: から
      meaning: Because, since
      kind: synonym
      nuance: から is a general expression for "because," without the added emphasis of ものですから. It's less
        formal and more widely applicable.
      grammar_point: から (reason cause)
    - term: ので
      meaning: Because, so, since, the reason being
      kind: synonym
      nuance: ので implies a more objective or logical reason, whereas ものですから often reflects a more personal
        or subjective explanation.
      grammar_point: ので (reason)
    - term: ものだ
      meaning: Supposed to, should, that's the way it is
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: ものだ expresses general truths, habits, or customs, while ものですから explains a specific cause or
        reason for a particular situation.
      grammar_point: ものだ (general truth expectation)
    - term: もの・もん
      meaning: Because, Cause
      kind: synonym
      nuance: もの or もん are very casual, often used by children or in intimate conversations, to directly
        state a reason. ものですから is more formal and explanatory.
      grammar_point: もの・もん (because・since)
    - term: ものだから
      meaning: Because, the reason is
      kind: synonym
      nuance: ものだから is nearly identical in meaning to ものですから but slightly less polite. It still carries
        more emphasis than a simple から.
      grammar_point: もので・ものだから (because・as an excuse)
    - term: なぜなら〜から
      meaning: Because, the reason is, that is because
      kind: synonym
      nuance: なぜなら〜から introduces a formal, often lengthy, explanation. ものですから is more concise and less emphatic
        than a full explanation introduced by なぜなら.
      grammar_point: なぜなら〜から (emphasized reason)
  post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that ものですから is used for giving **reasons** with
    a touch of politeness and emphasis. If you need to state a general truth, use ものだ. For objective reasons,
    use ので. For casual explanations, use ものか もん. For simply stating a reason without much emphasis, から works
    best. Finally, if you need to offer a full, formal explanation, use なぜなら〜から.

        common way to explain a personal reason without going into excessive detail in a professional but
        not strictly formal setting.
  post_example_writeup: The nuance of ものですから is a polite, but firm, explanation. It's useful when you want
    to provide a clear reason or excuse, and you can soften or emphasize it further by your choice of surrounding
    vocabulary.

    usage-context: Used to provide a strong reason or explanation, often for one's actions, circumstances,
      or inherent qualities of a situation, implying that the reason is compelling or unavoidable. It frequently
      serves as a justification or an excuse.
  etymology: The grammar point 「ものだから」 is derived from 「もの」, which roughly translates to 'thing' or 'reason,'
    and 「だから」, meaning 'therefore' or 'because.' The 「もの」 part emphasizes the reason being given, adding
    a layer of explanation to the simple 「から」.
  writeup: 「ものだから」 is used to provide a strong reason or explanation for something, often as an excuse.
    It's similar to 「から」 (because), but 「もの」 emphasizes the reason more strongly. You can think of 「ものだから」
    as conveying "the reason is..." or "because (of the situation)." It directly follows verbs and い-adjectives
    in their plain forms. For な-adjectives and nouns, you attach them in their plain forms (e.g., 静かなものだから,
    学生なものだから, or 静かだったものだから, 学生だったものだから). Sometimes it's shortened to 「もので」 or 「もんで」, without changing the
    core meaning. These shortened forms are common in more casual conversation. This grammar point is often
    used when explaining one's actions, emphasizing that a specific situation led to a particular action.

      nuance: 「ことだから」 implies a known characteristic or situation, where a consequence is expected based
        on someone's established nature or a well-known situation. In contrast, 「ものだから」 explains a specific
        reason or action, often serving as a personal justification.
      grammar_point: ことだから (given the nature of)
    - term: ので
      meaning: Because, so, since
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「ので」 provides a polite and objective reason. In contrast, 「ものだから」 conveys a stronger, more
        personal justification or explanation for a situation or action, often implying something unavoidable
        or an excuse.
      grammar_point: ので (reason)
    - term: なぜなら〜から
      meaning: Because, the reason is...
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「なぜなら〜から」 explicitly states a reason, typically in more formal or explanatory contexts, often
        following a statement that needs clarification. In contrast, 「ものだから」 serves as a more direct, sometimes
        apologetic, explanation for one's actions or circumstances, seamlessly connecting the reason to
        the preceding event.
      grammar_point: なぜなら〜から (emphasized reason)
    - term: からこそ
      meaning: Emphasized because, precisely because
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「からこそ」 highlights that *only* because of a certain strong reason does an outcome occur, implying
        unique importance or a causal necessity. 「ものだから」, while also emphasizing a reason, doesn't carry
        this 'sole reason' or 'unique importance' implication; it often serves as a compelling justification
        rather than a singular cause.
      grammar_point: からこそ (emphasized reason)
    - term: ものだ
      meaning: Indicates something is natural, expected, or supposed to be a certain way.
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: 「ものだ」 describes a general tendency, common practice, or natural outcome, often expressing
        what 'should be' or 'used to be'. 「ものだから」, however, provides a specific, often personal, reason
        or explanation for a particular event or action that has occurred.
      grammar_point: ものだ (general truth expectation)
    - term: もので・ものだから (because・as an excuse)
      meaning: Because, the reason is, my excuse is
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「ものですから」 is a more formal and polite version of 「ものだから」, often used in situations where a
        strong, polite justification or excuse is required. 「ものだから」 is more versatile and can be used in
        semi-formal to casual contexts, while 「もので」 is a slightly more casual contraction of 「ものだから」.
      grammar_point: もので・ものだから (because・as an excuse)
  post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「ものだから」 is used to explain a specific reason
    or justify an action. It's more emphatic than 「から」 or 「ので」 but less formal than 「ものですから」. 「ことだから」 is
    used when referring to a known characteristic or situation that leads to an expected outcome, while
    「ものだ」 expresses a general truth or expectation. When in doubt, consider the context and the level of
    formality required, as well as whether you are stating a general truth or a specific reason.
  examples:
    - english: Because I've been busy lately, I'm sorry I haven't been able to contact you much.
      japanese:
        - 最近 忙しい {もの だ から}、なかなか 連絡 でき なく て すみ ませ ん。
        - 最近 忙しい {もん だ から}、なかなか 連絡 でき なく て すみ ませ ん。
        - 最近 忙しい {もん で}、なかなか 連絡 でき なく て すみ ませ ん。

          english: Because I've been busy lately, I'm sorry I haven't been able to contact you much.
          hint: This simply states a reason. We're looking for a grammar point that strongly emphasizes
            the reason, often as a justification or explanation.
      scene: A friend apologizing for not returning calls.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: apologetic
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The speaker, a female, uses 「忙しいものだから」 to give a strong, almost apologetic reason for her
        lack of contact, indicating that her busy schedule is the primary and undeniable cause. This phrasing,
        combined with 「すみません」, softens the apology while clearly stating the reason.
      etymology: The phrase 「なかなか」 (hardly, scarcely) derives from a reduplication of the word 「中」 (naka,
        inside/middle), implying that something is 'in the middle' of being difficult or slow to achieve,
        thus 'not easily' or 'hardly'. Over time, it came to mean 'with difficulty' or 'not readily'.
    - english: Because this room doesn't get much sunlight, it's very cold in winter.
      japanese:
        - この 部屋 は 日当たり が 悪い {もの だ から}、冬 は とても 寒い ん です。
        - この 部屋 は 日当たり が 悪い {もん だ から}、冬 は とても 寒い ん です。

          hint: This simply states a reason. We're looking for a grammar point that strongly emphasizes
            the reason, often as a justification or explanation.
      scene: A tenant explaining a drawback of their apartment to a visitor.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: informative
      nuance: The speaker uses 「日当たりが悪いものだから」 to present the lack of sunlight as an inherent characteristic
        and strong, definitive reason for the room's coldness. The use of 「ものだから」 in this context provides
        a thorough and polite explanation, rather than a simple statement of cause and effect.
      etymology: 「日当たり」 (hiatari) literally means 'sun's hitting' or 'exposure to the sun'. It combines
        「日」 (hi, sun/day) and 「当たり」 (atari, hit/contact). It's a compound noun specifically for describing
        how much sunlight a place receives.
    - english: Because he's still a student, he doesn't know much about society.
      japanese:
        - 彼 は まだ 学生 な {もの だ から}、社会 の こと を よく 知ら ない ん です。
        - 彼 は まだ 学生 な {もん だ から}、社会 の こと を よく 知ら ない ん です。

          hint: This simply states a reason. We're looking for a grammar point that strongly emphasizes
            the reason, often as a justification or explanation.
      scene: An older man explaining a younger employee's naivety to another colleague.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: informative
      speaker_gender: male
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: The speaker (older male) uses 「学生なものだから」 to gently explain the younger male's lack of worldly
        experience, indicating that his status as a student is the direct and understandable reason for
        his ignorance. This phrasing implies a certain understanding or leniency due to the given reason.
      etymology: The concept of 「社会」 (shakai, society) in Japanese often encompasses not just human community
        but also the 'real world' or 'working world' in a practical sense, especially when contrasted with
        school life. It is a compound of 「社」 (sha, company/society) and 「会」 (kai, meeting/assembly).
    - english: Because I don't like sweets, I never eat dessert.
      japanese:
        - 甘い 物 が 苦手 な {もの だ から}、いつ も デザート は 食べ ない ん です よ。
        - 甘い 物 が 苦手 な {もん だ から}、いつ も デザート は 食べ ない ん です よ。

      scene: A woman explaining her dietary preference at a party.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: The speaker (female) uses 「苦手なものだから」 to explain a personal preference clearly and politely,
        making her choice of not eating dessert understandable to others. The final 「んですよ」 adds a gentle
        explanatory tone, inviting understanding for her personal situation.
      etymology: 「苦手」 (nigate) combines 「苦手」 (ni, difficult) and 「手」 (te, hand/skill). While it literally
        means 'bad at hand' or 'clumsy,' it has evolved to mean 'bad at' or 'dislike' something. This indicates
        a personal struggle or aversion rather than simple preference.
    - english: Because I have an important meeting tomorrow, I'll be leaving early today.
      japanese:
        - 明日 は 大事 な 会議 が ある {もの で}、今日 は 早め に 失礼 し ます。

          english: Because I have an important meeting tomorrow, I'll be leaving early today.
          hint: This states a reason more politely. We're looking for a grammar point that strongly emphasizes
            the reason, often as a justification or explanation.
      scene: An employee leaving work early, addressing their boss.
      register: formal
      setting: professional
      listener_gender: male
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The shortened form 「もので」 is used here by a younger employee addressing a male boss, indicating
        a polite and formal justification for leaving early. It implies that the reason is self-evident
        and should be accepted in a professional context without much additional explanation. 「失礼します」 (excuse
        me, I'm leaving) is standard polite closure.
      etymology: 「失礼」 (shitsurei) literally means 'losing etiquette' or 'discourtesy'. It's a compound of
        「失」 (shitsu, lose) and 「礼」 (rei, etiquette/bow). When used as 「失礼します」, it serves as a polite phrase
        for excusing oneself or leaving, implying a brief break in etiquette.

      japanese:
        - 昨夜 飲み すぎ た {もん で}、今日 は 頭 が 痛い よ。

          hint: This simply states a reason. We're looking for a grammar point that strongly emphasizes
            the reason, often as a justification or explanation.
      scene: A young man complaining to his friend about a hangover.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: male
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The use of 「飲みすぎたもんで」 is a very casual way for a younger male to explain his hangover to a
        friend, reflecting a direct, slightly self-deprecating explanation. The final 「よ」 emphasizes his
        current state and seeks understanding or agreement from the listener.
      etymology: 「飲みすぎた」 (nomisugita) is formed from 「飲む」 (nomu, to drink) and 「すぎる」 (sugiru, to exceed/be
        too much). This structure, Verb stem + すぎる, is common to express doing something excessively, directly
        implying a negative consequence. This formation has been a productive pattern in Japanese for centuries.

          hint: This simply states a reason. We're looking for a grammar point that strongly emphasizes
            the reason, often as a justification or explanation.
      scene: Someone commenting on uncomfortable shoes while walking with a friend.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The speaker, a female, uses 「小さいもんで」 to explain the reason for her discomfort in a casual
        conversation with a friend. The 「もんで」 concisely communicates the cause for her feet hurting, implying
        it's an understandable consequence of the shoes' size. This form is common in informal settings
        among close acquaintances.
      etymology: 「痛く なって き た」 (itaku natte kita) indicates a change of state that has started and is continuing,
        or has recently become apparent. 「なる」 (to become) denotes change, and 「くる」 (kuru, to come) when
        used as an auxiliary verb, signifies that the change has been ongoing up to the present moment or
        is something that has 'come about' to the speaker. This construction traces its roots back to classical
        Japanese, denoting progressive change.
    - english: Because I was on a business trip, my email reply was delayed.
      japanese:
        - 出張 中 だっ た {もの だ から}、メール の 返信 が 遅れ て しまい まし た。

          hint: This states a reason more politely. We're looking for a grammar point that strongly emphasizes
            the reason, often as a justification or explanation.
      scene: An office worker apologizing for a late email response.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: professional
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: The speaker, a male office worker, uses 「出張中だったものだから」 to clearly state the reason for the
        email delay. This phrasing provides a direct, slightly more emphatic justification for the oversight,
        suitable for a professional apology, implying that the reason is self-explanatory and justifiable.
      etymology: 「出張」 (shucchō) combines 「出」 (shu, go out) and 「張」 (chō, stretch/expand). It literally means
        'going out and expanding' or 'extending one's activities,' thus 'business trip.' The phrase 「～中」
        (chū, during) is a common suffix indicating 'in the middle of' or 'during' an activity.

      japanese:

      scene: A team leader explaining project delays to a manager.
      register: formal
      setting: professional
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The speaker, a male team leader, uses 「複雑なものだから」 to present the project's inherent complexity
        as the strong and primary reason for its slow progress to his manager. This formal use of 「ものだから」
        emphasizes the nature of the difficulty, providing a thorough justification for the delay.
      etymology: 「複雑」 (fukuzatsu, complex) is a compound of 「複」 (fuku, duplicate/multiple) and 「雑」 (zatsu,
        mixed/miscellaneous). Its etymology clearly indicates a state of having many elements mixed together,
        leading to complexity, fitting its modern usage for intricate problems or situations.

      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: apologetic
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The speaker (female) uses 「大幅に遅れたものだから」 to emphasize the unexpected and significant nature
        of the train delay as the absolute cause of missing the appointment. This phrasing provides a strong
        justification for her tardiness, implying the reason is beyond her control and should be understood.
        The use of 「ませんでした」 maintains politeness.
      etymology: 「大幅」 (ōhaba) literally means 'large width/margin.' It combines 「大」 (ō, large) and 「幅」 (haba,
        breadth). This word has extended its meaning to 'greatly' or 'significantly' in terms of degree
        or amount, indicating a substantial deviation, as in 'significantly delayed'.

      register: semi-formal
      setting: informative
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The speaker, a mother, uses 「寒いものだから」 to directly and emphatically link the severe cold outside
        to her child falling sick. This phrasing presents the cold as the undeniable cause, providing a
        clear explanation of the unfortunate outcome. The 「～てしまいました」 indicates a regrettable or complete
        action.
      etymology: 「風邪 を 引く」 (kaze o hiku, to catch a cold) is an idiomatic expression. 「引く」 (hiku) generally
        means 'to pull' or 'to draw.' In this context, it implies 'drawing in' or 'contracting' an illness.
        This usage is ancient and deeply ingrained in the Japanese language.

            all new and interesting.
          hint: This simply states a reason. We're looking for a grammar point that strongly emphasizes
            the reason, often as a justification or explanation.
      scene: Someone observing a friend on their first trip abroad.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The speaker, a male, uses 「海外旅行なものだから」 to explain his friend's enthusiastic behavior (taking
        many pictures, finding things new) as a direct and understandable consequence of it being his first
        overseas trip. This phrasing provides context for his excitement, implying it's 'only natural' given
        the situation. The casual tone fits friendly conversation.
      etymology: 「珍しがる」 (mezurashigaru) is a verb formed from the い-adjective 「珍しい」 (mezurashii, rare/unusual/new)
        by adding the suffix 「がる」. The 「がる」 suffix indicates that someone 'shows signs of feeling' or 'acts
        as if' they feel a certain way. So, 「珍しがる」 means 'to act as if something is new/unusual' or 'to
        find something new/unusual and show it'.
  post_example_writeup: Remember that 「ものだから」 adds a stronger emphasis to the reason compared to a simple
    「から」 or 「ので」. It's often used when the speaker feels a need to justify or explain their actions or circumstances
    more thoroughly. Also, remember that, in casual conversation, it is common to contract 「ものだから」 to 「もんだから」
    or 「もんで」.
