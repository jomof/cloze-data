    "etymology": "The phrase 「ところを見ると」 is derived from 「ところ」 (place, aspect, point) + 「を」 (object marker) + 「見る」 (to see, to look) + 「と」 (if, when). Literally, it means \"if/when looking at the aspect of,\" implying a judgment based on observation.",
    "writeup": "「ところを見ると」 is a set phrase that highlights a situation or aspect (A), before the speaker subjectively examines it. This often translates to \"judging from (A)\" or \"seeing that (A).\" The literal sense is \"if looking at the aspect of (A),\" before the speaker states their judgment. This pattern follows verbs in their plain form. Due to 「ところを見ると」 expressing subjective opinions based on observable actions, the (B) part of sentences often includes elements like 「だろう」, 「かも」, 「でしょう」, 「ね」, etc., indicating that the speaker is not stating a factual claim but rather expressing an opinion or speculation.",
