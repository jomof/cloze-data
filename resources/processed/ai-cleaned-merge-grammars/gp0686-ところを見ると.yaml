        "usage-context": "Used when making an inference or drawing a conclusion based on a specific observation or situation. It implies a subjective assessment.",
        "function": "To state a conclusion derived from observable evidence.",
        "nuance": "This pattern emphasizes that the speaker's conclusion is based on a specific, observable 'aspect' or 'situation' (ところ). It often precedes speculative expressions like だろう, かもしれない, or expressions of certainty like に違いない, reflecting that the conclusion is an inference rather than a direct statement of fact. It's often used when an action or state reveals something deeper."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from the literal meaning of 「ところ」 (place, aspect) + 「を」 (direct object particle) + 「見ると」 (if one looks at). So, literally, it means \"if one looks at the aspect of...\". This construction then evolved to mean \"judging from the situation/aspect of...\" as a way to introduce an inference based on observation. The 「を」 particle highlights the specific observation as the object of consideration, and 「と」 marks the conditional/conclusive relationship.",
    "writeup": "「ところを見ると」 is a set phrase used to express a judgment or conclusion based on observed evidence. It's similar to saying \"judging from\" or \"seeing that\" in English. It suggests that the speaker is making an inference based on a particular situation or action. The nuance is that the speaker isn't stating a definite fact, but rather offering an opinion or assessment based on what they've observed.\n\nThis grammar pattern will appear directly following verbs in any of their plain forms (dictionary, negative, past, or past negative). Because it expresses a primarily subjective opinion based on observable actions, the second part of the sentence will often include things like 「だろう」, 「かも」, 「でしょう」, 「ね」, etc., to show that the speaker is not actually claiming anything factually. It highlights the specific observable 'aspect' or 'situation' (ところ) as the basis for the speaker's inference.",
