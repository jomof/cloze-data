    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from the literal meaning of 「ところ」 (place, aspect) + 「を」 (particle) + 「見ると」 (if one looks at). So, literally, it means \"if one looks at the aspect of...\". This construction then evolved to mean \"judging from the situation/aspect of...\" as a way to introduce an inference based on observation.",
    "writeup": "「ところを見ると」 is a set phrase used to express a judgment or conclusion based on observed evidence. It's similar to saying \"judging from\" or \"seeing that\" in English. It suggests that the speaker is making an inference based on a particular situation or action. The nuance is that the speaker isn't stating a definite fact, but rather offering an opinion or assessment based on what they've observed.\n\nThis grammar pattern will appear directly following verbs in any of their standard forms. Because it expresses a primarily subjective opinion based on observable actions, the second part of the sentence will often include things like 「だろう」, 「かも」, 「でしょう」, 「ね」, etc., to show that the speaker is not actually claiming anything factually.",
