id: gp0889
meaning: What is called, So-called, Generally known
pronunciation:
  katakana: イワユル
  romaji: iwayuru
formation:
  いわゆる + Noun: Indicates something is 'what is called (A)', 'the so-called (A)', or 'generally known as
    (A)'.
  所謂 + Noun: Kanji form of いわゆる. Less common, but carries the same meaning.
jlpt: N2
etymology: いわゆる is a combination of いわ, a modern variant of いは, the indeterminate form of 言う (iu) 'to
  say', and ゆる, which is the classical literary equivalent of the auxiliary verb れる (reru), the displacement
  verb indicator in its attributive form. The kanji for 謂 means 'oral tradition,' highlighting how something
  is referred to over time or in different places.
writeup: |-
  いわゆる, occasionally written as 所謂 in kanji, is used before nouns to indicate that something is 'what is called (A),' 'the so-called (A),' or 'generally known as (A).' It literally means 'what is said to be (A)'. This phrase is crucial for introducing a common term or concept, suggesting that the speaker is referring to a widely recognized label or a conventional understanding. While its primary function is descriptive, it can sometimes carry a subtle nuance of skepticism or a detached perspective towards the term it introduces, much like the English 'so-called'.

  **Usage Notes:**
  *   **Scope**: いわゆる always precedes the noun or noun phrase it modifies.
  *   **Form**: The kanji form 所謂 is more formal and less common in everyday writing, often appearing in academic papers, legal documents, or very formal speeches. The hiragana form いわゆる is far more prevalent in general conversation and writing.
  *   **Nuance of Irony/Skepticism**: While often neutral, いわゆる can be used to imply that the speaker might not entirely agree with the term, or finds it somewhat misleading or superficial. For instance, referring to a 'so-called expert' can imply doubt about their expertise.

  - term: というのは
    meaning: Known as, Called, Means, Because
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike いわゆる, というのは is used to define or explain a term, rather than simply referencing a generally
      known term. It introduces an explanation or a reason.
    grammar_point: というのは (definition or reason)
  - term: という
    meaning: Called, Named, Known as, As much as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both can translate to 'called,' という is more versatile and used for quoting, specifying
      details, or generally linking a noun to a description. いわゆる is specifically for indicating a widely
      accepted or conventional term, often implying that the speaker is merely stating a common understanding.
    grammar_point: という (naming and definition)
  - term: 言うなれば
    meaning: So to speak, as it were
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While いわゆる introduces a commonly recognized term, 言うなれば introduces a descriptive or metaphorical
      expression, often used when there isn't a perfect existing term or to provide an analogy.
    grammar_point: 言ってみれば (figuratively speaking)
post_false_friends_writeup: The distinction lies in the nuance. Use いわゆる when referencing a generally
  accepted term or concept. Use というのは when you are defining or explaining something. Use という when you
  are quoting or specifying details or as a general nominalizer. 言うなれば is used to introduce an analogy
  or a figurative way of speaking, suggesting a comparison rather than a commonly established name.
examples:
  - english: Japan is often referred to as an academic background society.
    japanese:
      - 日本 は {いわゆる} 学歴 社会 だ と よく 言わ れる。
      - 日本 は {いわゆる} 学歴 社会 だ と 言わ れる こと が 多い です。
    english_literally: As for Japan, what is called academic background society it is, often said.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 が 学歴 社会 だ と {いう の は}、学歴 が 重視 さ れる 社会 だ と いう こと です。
        english: That Japan is an academic background society means that it is a society where academic
          background is emphasized.
        hint: というのは provides an explanation or a reason for a term. We're looking for a way to say something
          is commonly known as a certain term, not an explanation of it.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 は 学歴 社会 だ と {いう} 社会 だ と よく 言わ れる。
        english: It is often said that Japan is a society called academic background society.
        hint: という simply states something is 'called' by a certain name. いわゆる adds the nuance that this
          is a widely accepted or 'so-called' concept. We're looking for a term that introduces a commonly
          recognized label.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 は 学歴 社会 {だ と よく 言わ れる}。
        english: Japan is often said to be an academic background society.
        hint: This sentence states it as a fact, but doesn't convey the nuance of it being a commonly

    scene: A university lecturer is explaining a sociological concept to their students.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The phrase 「学歴 社会」 (gakureki shakai) is a commonly recognized sociological term in Japan.
      「いわゆる」 here introduces it as such. The overall sentence structure and the use of 「〜と よく 言われる」 (to
      yoku iwareru - it is often said that~) make it suitable for an academic setting.
  - english: She is what you'd call a city kid, and has no experience growing up in nature.

        english: The reason she is called a city kid is because she has no experience growing up in nature.
        hint: というのは provides an explanation or reason for a term. We're looking for a way to introduce
          a commonly used descriptive term, not explain why it applies.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 都会 っ子 {です}。
        english: She is a city kid.
        hint: This sentence simply states a fact. We're looking for a phrase that implies she is commonly
          referred to as a city kid, indicating a recognized type.
    scene: Two friends are discussing their personalities and upbringings.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「都会っ子」 (tokai-kko) is a common colloquial term for a city child. Using 「いわゆる」 emphasizes that
      this is a recognized type of person. The casual nature of the conversation is reflected in the plain
      forms used throughout the sentence.

        english: Fake news on the internet means it is false information.
        hint: というのは defines or explains a concept. We're looking for a phrase that introduces a widely
          recognized term, often with a hint of skepticism, not a definition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - インターネット 上 に は フェイク ニュース {と いう} 情報 が 溢れ て いる。
        english: On the internet, information called fake news is overflowing.
        hint: という simply states something is called that. いわゆる adds a nuance of it being a commonly recognized
          or 'so-called' term, potentially implying skepticism. We're looking for that specific nuance.
      - competing_japanese:
          - インターネット 上 に は 嘘 の ニュース {が 溢れ て いる}。
        english: On the internet, false news is overflowing.
        hint: This sentence uses a direct term for 'lie' instead of the commonly accepted term. We're
          looking for a phrase that introduces a widely recognized label for misinformation.
    scene: A news anchor reporting on current events and misinformation.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: This example uses 「いわゆる」 to introduce a modern, widely discussed term 「フェイクニュース」 (feiku nyūsu
      - fake news). The formal phrasing 「溢れて いる」 (afurete iru - overflowing) and the overall context suit
      a serious, informative setting like a news report.
  - english: When I was young, I was what you'd call a playboy, but now I've settled down.
    japanese:
      - 若い 頃 は {所謂} 遊び人 だっ た けど、今 は 落ち着い た もの よ。

          - 若い 頃 は 遊び人 {だっ た}。
        english: When I was young, I was a playboy.
        hint: This sentence simply states a fact. We're looking for a phrase that introduces a commonly
          recognized or 'so-called' type of person.
    scene: An older woman reminiscing with a younger relative over tea.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of the more formal kanji 「所謂」 (shoi) with a casual term like 「遊び人」 (asobinin - playboy/player)
      creates a slightly self-deprecating or detached tone, as if acknowledging a common stereotype from
      her past. The feminine sentence-final particle 「もの よ」 (mono yo) reinforces the speaker's gender
      and the casual, reflective mood.
  - english: In some cases, liability may be exempted due to the so-called force majeure clause stated
      in the contract.

        english: A force majeure clause means that performance becomes impossible due to unforeseen events.
        hint: というのは defines or explains a legal term. We're looking for a phrase that introduces a specific,
          recognized legal term without defining it, implying it's a common concept.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 契約 書 に 記載 さ れ た 不可抗 力 条項 {と いう 文言} に よっ て、責任 が 免除 さ れる 場合 が ある。
        english: In some cases, liability may be exempted due to the wording called 'force majeure clause'
          stated in the contract.
        hint: という can identify something as 'called,' but いわゆる specifically refers to a widely recognized
          or 'so-called' legal concept. We're looking for that specific nuance in a legal context, highlighting
          its conventional usage.
    scene: A lawyer explaining a complex legal document to a client.
    register: formal
    setting: legal
    nuance: In a legal context, 「所謂」 (shoi) is often used to refer to specific, established legal terms
      like 「不可抗力 条項」 (fukakōryoku jōkō - force majeure clause). Its formal usage indicates that the term
      is a conventionally designated concept within the legal framework.

        english: The reason he is a perfectionist is because he never compromises on any task.
        hint: というのは explains or gives a reason for a term. We're looking for a way to introduce a commonly
          recognized personality type, not to explain why he is that way.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 完璧 主義 者 {と いう 人} です。
        english: He is a person called a perfectionist.

    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「完璧主義者」 (kanpeki shugisha) is a commonly recognized personality type. 「いわゆる」 introduces it
      as a familiar label, implying the speaker is using a widely understood classification. The polite
      「です」 at the end maintains a semi-formal, professional tone suitable for colleagues.

          anything.
        hint: というのは provides an explanation or reason for a term. We're looking for a way to affectionately
          label someone with a recognized term, emphasizing their significant status.
      - competing_japanese:
          - お前 は 俺 の 唯一 の 親友 {だ}。
        english: You are my only true friend.
        hint: という simply states a fact. いわゆる here conveys the specific, often emotional, recognition of
          someone as a certain type of person, giving the label a deeper, almost designated, meaning within
          the relationship. We're looking for that special nuance.
    scene: A young man earnestly speaking to his best friend.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male

    nuance: The use of the informal male pronouns 「お前」 (omae) for the listener and 「俺」 (ore) for the speaker,
      combined with the phrase 「唯一 の 親友」 (yuiitsu no shin'yū - only true friend), expresses a deep, exclusive
      bond. 「いわゆる」 here elevates this friendship to a designated, significant status. The casual ending
      「したい」 (shitai) indicates strong personal sentiment often found in intimate male friendships.
  - english: This is what we call our company's main product.

    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: professional

    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The highly formal business language, including 「弊社」 (heisha - our company, humble) and the
      honorific 「で ございます」 (de gozaimasu), sets a professional tone. 「いわゆる」 here introduces the product
      by its designated or recognized title within the company's framework, typical in business presentations
      where terms are formally introduced.

      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 美術 展 は、ガラクタ の 集まり {だっ た} よ。
        english: That art exhibition was a collection of junk.
        hint: This simply states a fact. We're looking for a phrase that implies the speaker doesn't truly
          consider it an 'art exhibition', suggesting a discrepancy between name and reality.
    scene: Two friends casually discussing a recent visit to an art gallery.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「いわゆる」 combined with the dismissive 「ただ の ガラクタ」 (tada no garakuta - just junk)
      conveys skepticism and disappointment, implying that the 'art exhibition' did not live up to its
      name. The casual 「だった よ」 (datta yo) reinforces the informal, conversational tone appropriate between

        english: She is a morning person.
        hint: This sentence simply states a fact. We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes this is a
          common, recognized type of person, suggesting a shared understanding of the label.
    scene: Two colleagues chatting about a mutual friend's habits.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「朝型 人間」 (asagata ningen - morning person) is a widely understood term describing a person's
      daily rhythm. 「いわゆる」 here introduces this as a common, descriptive label. The sentence-final particle
      「の よ」 (no yo) adds a feminine, explanatory nuance often used when sharing observations with a friend
      or colleague.
post_example_writeup: These examples demonstrate the versatility of いわゆる across different registers and
  contexts. Whether describing abstract social concepts, personal traits, or professional designations,
  いわゆる consistently functions to frame the subsequent noun as a recognized or conventional term. The kanji
  form 所謂 is generally reserved for more formal or academic prose, as shown in the legal context.
