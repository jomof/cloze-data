    "writeup": "「を限りに」 is a structure that follows nouns, typically indicating a specific time, to express a deadline or termination point for a continuing action or state. It conveys the meaning of \"ending with (A), (B)\" or \"no longer than (A), (B).\" This grammar pattern combines the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「限り」 meaning \"limit,\" and the case-marking particle 「に」.\n\n「を限りに」 is often used in formal announcements or proclamations and is considered more formal than similar structures like 「限りで」. A notable exception to the temporal usage is the set phrase 「声を限りに」, which means \"to the limit of one's voice.\"\n\n*   **Key Usage:**\n\n    *   Announcing a final date or event after which something will cease.\n    *   Expressing a decision or change that takes effect from a specific point in time.",
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を限りに」 is derived from the particle 「を」, the noun 「限り(かぎり)」 (limit, extent), and the particle 「に」. The combination signifies using a certain point as the limit or boundary for something.",
