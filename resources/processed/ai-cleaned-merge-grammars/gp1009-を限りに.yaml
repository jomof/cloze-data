        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "expresses a fixed boundary in time or extent",

    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を限りに」 is derived from the particle 「を」, the noun 「限り (かぎり)」 (limit, extent), and the particle 「に」. The combination signifies using a certain point as the limit or boundary for something. Historically, 「限り」 referred to physical boundaries or ends, which then extended to temporal limits.",
    "writeup": "「を限りに」 is a structure that follows nouns, typically indicating a specific time, to express a definitive deadline or termination point for a continuing action or state. It conveys the meaning of \"ending with (A), (B)\" or \"no longer than (A), (B).\" This grammar pattern combines the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「限り」 meaning \"limit,\" and the case-marking particle 「に」.\n\nThis expression is often used in formal announcements or proclamations, making it more formal and definitive than similar structures like 「限りで」. It is primarily used for stating a final date or event after which something will cease, or expressing a decision or change that takes effect from a specific point in time.\n\nAlthough 「を限りに」 almost always follows words indicating a specific time or place that is being viewed temporally, there is a notable exception: the set expression 「声を限りに」, which means \"to the limit of one's voice\" or \"with all one's might.\" This idiom refers to using one's voice to its maximum extent, breaking the usual rule of temporal or spatial limits.",
