    "details": {
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "expresses a fixed boundary in time or extent",
        "nuance": "implies a definitive end to a continuous state or action, often used in formal declarations or resolutions.",
        "source": "general Japanese usage",
        "grammatical-role": "adverbial phrase",
        "temporal-flow": "marks a termination point for something ongoing"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を限りに」 is derived from the particle 「を」, the noun 「限り (かぎり)」 (limit, extent), and the particle 「に」. The combination signifies using a certain point as the limit or boundary for something. Historically, 「限り」 referred to physical boundaries or ends, which then extended to temporal limits.",
    "writeup": "「を限りに」 is a structure that follows nouns, typically indicating a specific time, to express a definitive deadline or termination point for a continuing action or state. It conveys the meaning of \"ending with (A), (B)\" or \"no longer than (A), (B).\" This grammar pattern combines the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「限り」 meaning \"limit,\" and the case-marking particle 「に」.\n\nThis expression is often used in formal announcements or proclamations, making it more formal and definitive than similar structures like 「限りで」. It is primarily used for stating a final date or event after which something will cease, or expressing a decision or change that takes effect from a specific point in time.\n\nAlthough 「を限りに」 almost always follows words indicating a specific time or place that is being viewed temporally, there is a notable exception: the set expression 「声を限りに」, which means \"to the limit of one's voice\" or \"with all one's might.\" This idiom refers to using one's voice to its maximum extent, breaking the usual rule of temporal or spatial limits.",
    "false_friends": [
        {
            "term": "限り",
            "meaning": "as far as; while; until; unless; as long as; the end; the limit",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「限り」 is much broader and more versatile, covering conditions, extents, and limits. 「を限りに」 specifically denotes a clear and often formally declared point of termination for an ongoing action or state, emphasizing the finality."
        },
        {
            "term": "限りで",
            "meaning": "until; as far as; only; as long as",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「限りで」 is less formal and often implies a condition or limitation, or a casual end point. 「を限りに」, in contrast, expresses a more formal, definitive, and often publicly announced cutoff or starting point for a new state, without implying a condition."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「限り」 and 「限りで」 share some overlap in meaning, 「を限りに」 is distinct in its usage. It is crucial to remember that 「を限りに」 emphasizes a definitive end or a firm starting point, typically announced in formal settings or when making a clear declaration. In contrast, 「限り」 and 「限りで」 have broader uses, including indicating conditions, limits, or durations without the same sense of finality.",
