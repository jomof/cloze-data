        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "Indicates a concession or contrast to a previously stated or commonly held belief.",
        "nuance": "Sets up an expectation based on a general understanding or statement (Phrase A) and then introduces a reality (Phrase B) that contradicts, qualifies, or casts doubt on that expectation. Phrase B is always the more significant or defining detail.",
        "source": "Bunpro"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とは言うものの」 is derived from 「と」 (a particle indicating content or quotation), 「は」 (a topic marker), 「言う」 (the verb 'to say'), and 「ものの」 (a conjunction indicating concession, similar to 'although' or 'though'). Thus, it literally translates to \"although it is said that...\" or \"though one says...\". This construction highlights a contrast between a commonly acknowledged or explicitly stated idea and a subsequent differing reality or condition.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「とは言うものの」 serves to introduce a contrasting reality after a statement or commonly held belief. It functions much like \"although,\" \"but,\" or \"having said that\" in English. The phrase acknowledges an initial point (A) before presenting a different, often more important, reality or nuance (B).\n\n**Structure and Usage:**\n「とは言うものの」 can connect various parts of speech:\n*   **Verbs (Dictionary form), い-Adjectives, short forms of Auxiliary Verbs:** Directly attach to the plain form (e.g., 働く＋とは言うものの, 難しい＋とは言うものの, ない＋とは言うものの).\n*   **Nouns and な-Adjectives:** These require 「だ」 before 「とは言うものの」 (e.g., 学生だ＋とは言うものの, 静かだ＋とは言うものの).\n\n**Key Nuance:**\nThe crucial element of 「とは言うものの」 is that the latter part of the sentence (the information after 「ものの」) is considered the more important or defining detail. It sets up an expectation or acknowledges a general truth, only to then present a qualification or a contradictory truth that undermines or recontextualizes the initial statement.\n\nThis phrase can also initiate a sentence, acknowledging a prior statement or a widely understood concept before introducing a counterpoint. It is a versatile expression, often encountered in both spoken and written Japanese, and is generally considered standard in register.",
