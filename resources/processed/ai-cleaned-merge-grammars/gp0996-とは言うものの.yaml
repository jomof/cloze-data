        "source": "Bunpro"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とは言うものの」 is derived from 「と」 (a particle indicating content or quotation), 「は」 (a topic marker), 「言う」 (the verb 'to say'), and 「ものの」 (a conjunction indicating concession, similar to 'although' or 'though'). Thus, it literally translates to \"although it is said that...\" or \"though one says...\". This construction highlights a contrast between a commonly acknowledged or explicitly stated idea and a subsequent differing reality or condition.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「とは言うものの」 serves to introduce a contrasting reality after a statement or commonly held belief. It functions much like \"although,\" \"but,\" or \"having said that\" in English. The phrase acknowledges an initial point (A) before presenting a different, often more important, reality or nuance (B).\n\n**Structure and Usage:**\n「とは言うものの」 can connect various parts of speech:\n*   **Verbs (Dictionary form), い-Adjectives, short forms of Auxiliary Verbs:** Directly attach to the plain form (e.g., 働く＋とは言うものの, 難しい＋とは言うものの, ない＋とは言うものの).\n*   **Nouns and な-Adjectives:** These require 「だ」 before 「とは言うものの」 (e.g., 学生だ＋とは言うものの, 静かだ＋とは言うものの).\n\n**Key Nuance:**\nThe crucial element of 「とは言うものの」 is that the latter part of the sentence (the information after 「ものの」) is considered the more important or defining detail. It sets up an expectation or acknowledges a general truth, only to then present a qualification or a contradictory truth that undermines or recontextualizes the initial statement.\n\nThis phrase can also initiate a sentence, acknowledging a prior statement or a widely understood concept before introducing a counterpoint. It is a versatile expression, often encountered in both spoken and written Japanese, and is generally considered standard in register.",

            "nuance": "「とは言うものの」 strongly introduces a contrasting reality after a statement, often implying a widely held belief or common understanding. 「と言っても」, while also indicating a contrast, can be used more broadly to add a nuance of \"even so\" or \"despite that,\" often suggesting a slight contradiction or clarification rather than a full counter-argument. It's more about clarifying a point than contradicting a widely held belief."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Both 「と言っても」 and 「とは言え」, like 「とは言うものの」, express a concession or contrast. However, 「とは言うものの」 typically acknowledges a common understanding or a stated fact, only to follow it with a reality that significantly diverges from that initial statement, often implying a somewhat strong counterpoint or a nuance of 'despite what is generally said/believed'. In contrast, 「と言っても」 can be more about adding a slight qualification or a clarifying point to a statement, often translating to 'even so' or 'even if that's the case'. 「とは言え」 tends to be more formal and introduces a counter-argument to a preceding statement, often with a slightly more objective or universally applicable feel than the other two expressions.",
