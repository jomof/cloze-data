    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of:\n*   「と」, a particle marking a quote or statement.\n*   「は」, a topic marker.\n*   「言う」 (iu), meaning \"to say\".\n*   「ものの」 (mono no), a conjunction meaning \"although\" or \"but\".\nLiterally, it means \"although it is said that...\", expressing a contrast between what is said and what is actually the case.",
    "writeup": "「とは言うものの」 is a set expression used to present a contrasting or qualifying statement. It's similar to saying \"although\" or \"but\" in English. It acknowledges a previous statement but then introduces a contrasting or limiting point. It is a combination of 「と」 as a case-marking particle, 「は」 as an adverbial particle, the verb 「言う」, and the conjunction particle 「ものの」 meaning 'although'. The phrase can be used after various types of words. When used after nouns or な-adjectives, 「だ」 precedes 「とは言うものの」.\n\nThis phrase can also start sentences, recognizing a statement but highlighting other important information. The clause after 「ものの」 is usually the more important detail.",
