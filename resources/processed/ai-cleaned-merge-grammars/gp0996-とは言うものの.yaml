        "Register": "Standard",
        "Usage Scope": "General"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とは言うものの」 is derived from 「と」 (a particle indicating content), 「は」 (a topic marker), 「言う」 (the verb 'to say'), and 「ものの」 (a conjunction indicating concession, similar to 'although'). So, it literally translates to \"although it is said that...\".",
    "writeup": "「とは言うものの」 is a set expression used to introduce a contrast between a statement or common belief (A) and a differing reality or opinion (B). It's similar to \"although\" or \"but\" in English. When used after nouns or な-adjectives, 「だ」 typically precedes 「とは言うものの」. The phrase can also start a sentence, acknowledging a previous statement while introducing further important details. The (B) portion after 「ものの」 is usually the more important or defining point.",

                    "mitigation": "「とは言うものの」 specifically emphasizes a widely accepted belief or common saying that is then contradicted, whereas 「けれども」 is a more general conjunction for introducing a contrast. The scene encourages considering a broader, commonly held idea rather than a simple conjunction."
                },
                {

                    "mitigation": "「のに」 expresses surprise or dissatisfaction, which is not the primary nuance of this sentence. The scene directs the focus towards a reflective contrast, not an unexpected outcome."

            "etymology": "「頑張れば」 is the conditional form of the verb 「頑張る」, meaning 'to try hard'."

The use of 「とは言うものの」 implies that while the salary is good, the lack of time is a significant, almost contradictory, reality. The female speaker's tone here is direct and factual, commonly heard from both genders in professional settings.",
