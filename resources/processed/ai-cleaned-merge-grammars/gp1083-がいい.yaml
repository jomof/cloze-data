        "Register": "Formal, often used in commanding or superior contexts.",

    "etymology": "「がいい」 is derived from the particle 「が」, indicating the subject, and the い-adjective 「いい」 (good). It literally translates to \"(it) is good that...\", but in usage, it takes on a stronger, commanding tone.",
    "writeup": "「がいい」 combines the particle 「が」 with the い-adjective 「いい」. While it literally means \"it is good that...\", it functions as a strong suggestion or command. **Important note:** This grammar point is generally used by someone in a position of authority or who perceives themselves to be. Using 「がいい」 can sound magnanimous or even pompous if you're not careful. In many cases, the more literary 良(よ)い may be used in place of いい. Verb + 「がいい」 can be thought of as a far stronger equivalent of 「たほうがいい」 \"you should (A)\", except that it will only ever be used by those that consider their own suggestion as the only correct course of action. Because of its strong connotation, it's rarely used in everyday conversation.",
