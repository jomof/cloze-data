        "Register": "Often sounds like an order from someone in a higher position.",

    "writeup": "「がいい」 combines the case-marking particle 「が」 and the *i*-adjective 「いい」. It's used to express what would be \"good\" or preferable, often sounding like a command or strong suggestion from someone of higher status. A literal translation could be \"to (A) would be good,\" where (A) is the verb in dictionary form. Because of its commanding tone, 「がいい」 is rarely used in everyday conversation and can sound pompous. Typically, 「がいい」 is only used by someone who is in a very high position, or perceives themselves to be in a very high position such as a king, emperor, or wise wizard. The more literary 「良(よ)い」 is frequently used in place of 「いい」, lending an archaic feel. The negative form, 「がよくない」 means it would be bad to do something.",
    "etymology": "「いい」 comes from the adjective 「良い(よい)」 which means \"good\". The 「が」 particle marks the subject or topic of the sentence as being \"good\" or desirable. Therefore, the etymological meaning is that doing the preceding action is \"good\".",
