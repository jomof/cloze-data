    },
    "etymology": "The grammatical construction 「ことができる」 is derived from combining the nominalizer 「こと」 (koto, meaning 'thing' or 'matter'), the subject particle 「が」, and the verb 「できる」 (dekiru, meaning 'to be able to' or 'to be possible'). Literally, it translates to \"the matter/thing is possible\" or \"the matter/thing can be done\". This structure allows for a noun clause (formed by the verb in plain form followed by こと) to become the subject of 「できる」, thus expressing the potential or possibility of that entire action or state. This explicit nominalization differentiates it from simpler potential verb forms like 「～れる/られる」.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ることができる」 is a fundamental expression used to convey **ability** or **possibility** in Japanese. It literally means \"the matter (of doing X) is possible\" or \"one is able to do X\".\n\nThis construction is primarily used after a verb in its plain, dictionary form. For example, 「日本語を話すことができる」 means \"I can speak Japanese\". It can also follow a noun, typically indicating a skill or a general possibility related to that noun, such as 「料理ができる」 meaning \"She can cook\" or \"Cooking is possible (here)\".\n\n**Key Usages and Nuances:**\n*   **Acquired Ability**: Often emphasizes a learned or acquired skill, like speaking a language or playing an instrument. While the potential form of a verb (e.g., 「話せる」) also expresses ability, 「ることができる」 can provide a slightly more formal or explicit statement of this capability.\n*   **External Circumstances**: It is frequently used to describe what is possible or permissible due to external factors, rules, or conditions. For instance, 「ここではタバコを吸うことができない」 (You cannot smoke here) indicates a rule or restriction.\n*   **Formal Contexts**: In formal or official settings, 「することができる」 is often preferred over simple potential forms when stating rules, regulations, or what is generally possible.\n*   **Emphasis on the Act**: It can put more emphasis on the entire action or circumstance itself as being possible, rather than just the inherent capability of the subject.",

Conversely, 「～れる/られる」 often focuses on an **inherent capability** or a **natural potential**. For example, 「日本語を話すことができる」 (I can speak Japanese) highlights the acquired skill, while 「富士山が見える」 (Mt. Fuji can be seen) refers to a natural occurrence or the inherent possibility of seeing it.",
