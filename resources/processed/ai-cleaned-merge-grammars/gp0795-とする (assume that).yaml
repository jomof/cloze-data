    "writeup": "The grammar point 「{とする}」 is a versatile expression used to convey the acts of assuming, supposing, regarding, or deciding something to be true or to happen. It sets up a premise, a condition, or a classification within a statement. While frequently encountered in written works and formal discourse, 「{とする}」 also finds its place in casual conversation, especially when setting up hypothetical scenarios or inviting shared agreement on a premise.\n\nThere are generally two main structural patterns for 「{とする}」:\n\n1.  **To assume or suppose (普通形 + と する)**: This form follows a plain form verb, adjective, or a noun (often with an implied だ). It is used to present a hypothetical situation, a temporary assumption for the sake of argument, or a condition. For instance, in scientific contexts or academic discussions, it's common to state, 「空気 抵抗 は 無視 できる {とする}」 (Let's assume air resistance can be ignored).\n2.  **To consider/regard as, or to decide upon (Noun1 を Noun2 + とする)**: This structure is used when actively designating, treating, or classifying something as something else. It reflects a decision or an established view. For example, 「彼 を プロジェクト リーダー {とする}」 (We will make him the project leader) or 「この 出来事 を 教訓 {とする}」 (We will take this event as a lesson).\n\n「{とする}」 can also be conjugated into various forms, including the passive 「{とされる}」 (is considered/regarded as), which is commonly used to express general consensus or public opinion about something. The volitional forms 「{としよう}」 or 「{としましょう}」 are particularly useful for inviting others to join in a shared supposition or agreement.",
