    "etymology": "「あいだ」 (間) means \"interval\" or \"space\". When used with 「ている」 form, it highlights the ongoing event as the 'whole' span of time, within which another event happens at some point.",
    "writeup": "「ているあいだに」 indicates that (B) happens within the timeframe of (A).  The (B) action must occur somewhere within the duration of (A). There does not need to be any specific connection between the actions. It often describes actions that are beyond the speaker's direct control. 「間」 literally means an \"interval\", which highlights the (A) event as being the 'whole' span of time, within which (B) happened/will happen at some point.  This construction translates naturally as \"during the time that (A), (B)\".",
