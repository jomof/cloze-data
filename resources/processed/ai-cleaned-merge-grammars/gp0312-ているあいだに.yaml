    "etymology": "「あいだ」 (間) means \"interval\" or \"space\". When used with 「ている」 form, it highlights the ongoing event as the 'whole' span of time, within which another event happens at some point.",
    "writeup": "「ているあいだに」 indicates that event (B) happens within the timeframe of ongoing action (A). The (B) action must occur somewhere within the duration of (A). There does not need to be any specific causal connection between the actions. It often describes actions that are beyond the speaker's direct control, though this is not always the case. 「間」 literally means an \"interval\", which highlights the (A) event as being the 'whole' span of time, within which (B) happened or will happen at some point. This construction translates naturally as \"during the time that (A), (B)\".",
