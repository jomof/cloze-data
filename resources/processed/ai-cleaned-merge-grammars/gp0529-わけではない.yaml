    "etymology": "「わけ」means \"reason\" or \"cause.\" The phrase 「わけではない」literally translates to \"it's not that reason,\" implying that the stated reason is not the only or complete explanation.",
    "writeup": "「わけではない」 is used to deny a direct cause-and-effect relationship or a simple assumption. It conveys the nuance that there's more to the situation than what is immediately apparent. It's similar to saying \"It's not necessarily the case that...\" or \"It doesn't mean that...\". The 「では」 part can often be replaced with 「じゃ」 in more casual speech. The word before 「わけ」 must be in attributive form (dictionary form for verbs and い-adjectives, な-adjective stem + な, and nouns directly). It's often used to soften a statement or provide a more nuanced explanation.",
