    },
    "etymology": "The term 「わけ」 (wake) is originally a noun meaning \"reason,\" \"cause,\" \"circumstance,\" or \"meaning.\" When combined with 「ではない」 (de wa nai), which is the negative form of 「だ」 (da - the copula) followed by the contrastive particle 「は」 (wa) and the negative auxiliary 「ない」 (nai), the phrase literally translates to \"it is not the reason/circumstance.\" Over time, this construction evolved to express the nuance of denying a direct implication or oversimplified assumption, suggesting that the apparent reason or situation is not the complete truth, but rather a more complex underlying reality exists.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「わけではない」 is a nuanced expression used to deny a direct cause-and-effect relationship or to clarify that a statement is not an absolute truth. It conveys that something is not *necessarily* the case, or that there's a more subtle reality than what might be initially assumed. While it negates, it differs from a simple negative statement by implying that the surface appearance or common assumption is not entirely accurate.\n\nThis expression is highly versatile and can be attached to verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns, provided the preceding word is in its plain (attributive) form. For verbs and い-adjectives, the plain form is used directly before 「わけではない」. For な-adjectives, the stem is followed by 「な」 (e.g., 暇**な**わけではない). For nouns, it's typically followed by 「だ」 (which is often omitted in casual speech or when followed by 「という」), or 「という」 (e.g., 学生**だ**わけではない, 学生**という**わけではない). The particle 「では」 can be casually replaced by 「じゃ」, making 「わけじゃない」 common in informal speech.\n\n「わけではない」 is often used to soften a denial or to introduce a more complex explanation. For example, if someone assumes you dislike something because you don't do it often, you might use 「わけではない」 to clarify that while you don't do it often, it doesn't mean you dislike it; there might be other reasons. It's a way to politely correct a misunderstanding without making a strong, direct negation.",
