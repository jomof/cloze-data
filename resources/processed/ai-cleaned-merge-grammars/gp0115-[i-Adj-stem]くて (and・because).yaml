meaning: And; so; used to connect い-adjectives or to connect an い-adjective to a verb.
pronunciation:
  katakana: くて
  romaji: kute
formation:
  い-Adjective (stem form) + くて: Used to connect two or more i-adjectives, indicating multiple qualities,
    or to connect an i-adjective to a verb to describe the manner of action. It can also indicate a cause
    or reason.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: casual
  function: Connects adjectives, specifies cause, or modifies verbs.
  grammatical-role: Conjunctive particle for i-adjectives
etymology: The conjunctive form 「くて」 evolved from the classical Japanese conjunctive particle 「く」 which
  served to connect adjectives to verbs or other adjectives, indicating manner or sequence. The addition
  of 「て」, which is typically used to connect verbs in sequence or indicate cause, reinforces this function
  for adjectives, allowing them to express a causal relationship or simply list attributes in a flowing
  manner. This structure maintains the adverbial nature of the adjective stem while providing a clear
  link to the subsequent clause.
writeup: |-
  The suffix 「くて」 is a fundamental conjunctive form for い-adjectives in Japanese. It serves several important functions, primarily to connect multiple い-adjectives in a descriptive sequence, to provide a reason or cause for a subsequent action or state, or to modify a verb by describing the manner in which an action is performed.

  When connecting multiple い-adjectives, 「くて」 creates a list of qualities, similar to using "and" in English. For example, 「高くて大きい」 means "tall and big." The qualities are presented as being concurrently true.

  It can also express cause or reason, much like the te-form of verbs. If you say 「寒くて風邪をひいた」, it means "I caught a cold because it was cold." Here, the coldness is the direct reason for catching the cold.

  Furthermore, 「くて」 can act adverbially, allowing an い-adjective to modify a verb. For instance, 「楽しく歌う」 means "to sing happily." In this usage, the adjective describes the manner of the action.

  It is important to remember that 「くて」 is used exclusively with い-adjectives. For な-adjectives and nouns, different connecting particles or forms are used, such as 「で」.

  - term: な-Adjective + で
    meaning: And; because (for na-adjectives and nouns)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「くて」 is used for い-adjectives, 「で」 is used for な-adjectives and nouns to connect them,
      indicate a reason, or describe a state. For example, 「静かで綺麗」 (quiet and beautiful) uses 「で」, whereas
      an い-adjective like 「新しくて便利」 (new and convenient) uses 「くて」. We're looking for connections specifically
      for い-adjectives.

  - term: Verb[て] (and then)
    meaning: And then; after that; because (for verbs)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The te-form of verbs primarily indicates a sequence of actions or a cause-and-effect relationship,
      such as 「食べて、寝る」 (eat and then sleep) or 「疲れて、眠い」 (tired, so sleepy). While 「くて」 also indicates
      reason, its application is strictly limited to い-adjectives, unlike the te-form which is for verbs.
      We're looking for connections specifically for い-adjectives.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] (and then)
post_false_friends_writeup: When considering the use of 「くて」, remember its direct connection to the い-adjective
  form. It functions similarly to the te-form of verbs or the 「で」 form of な-adjectives and nouns, but
  each particle is specific to its part of speech. The core concept is connecting elements or indicating
  cause, but the grammatical rules for which form to use are strict based on the word type.
examples:
  - english: This apple is red and delicious.
    japanese:
      - この りんご は 赤く て おいしい です。
      - この りんご 赤く て おいしい よ。

          - この りんご は 赤く おいしい です。
        english: This apple is red and delicious (without proper conjunction).
        hint: The い-adjective stem 「赤く」 alone doesn't function as a smooth conjunctive here. We're looking
          for a form that connects two adjectives properly.

        hint: While 「から」 also indicates reason, 「くて」 allows for a more direct and sometimes softer connection,
          particularly when the reason is a descriptive quality. We're looking for a connection that directly
          links the adjective's state to the action.

        english: This coffee is hot, and delicious (less natural connection).
        hint: The simple adverbial form 「熱く」 is not the standard way to connect two adjectives in a descriptive

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate the versatility of 「くて」 in Japanese. Whether describing
  multiple attributes of a single item, explaining the cause of an event, or modifying a verb's action,
  「くて」 efficiently links い-adjectives to the rest of the sentence. Mastering this form is crucial for
  constructing natural and nuanced Japanese sentences, particularly when dealing with descriptions and
  reasons.
