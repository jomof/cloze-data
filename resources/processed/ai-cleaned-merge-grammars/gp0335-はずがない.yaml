    "etymology": "The term 「はず」 comes from the kanji 「筈」, which originally referred to the notched end of an arrow that is fitted to the bowstring. From this, it evolved to mean 'should' or 'expected' because the arrow is 'meant' to fit the string in a certain way. Therefore, 「はずがない」 essentially means something is 'not supposed to be' or 'cannot be' in a certain state.",
    "writeup": "「はずがない」 expresses a strong sense of disbelief or denial. It suggests that something is highly unlikely or virtually impossible. It's similar to saying \"there's no way\" or \"it can't be\". While it can be translated as \"hardly possible,\" \"improbable,\" or \"unlikely,\" it conveys a stronger sense of impossibility than those English terms might suggest. It emphasizes that a certain outcome or situation is not conceivable. It is frequently used to contradict information that the speaker finds unbelievable. Note that 「はずがない」 is different from 「ないはずだ」. 「ないはずだ」 expresses the speaker's opinion that something is almost definitely not true.",
