    "etymology": "The term 「はず」 comes from the kanji 「筈」, which originally referred to the notched end of an arrow that is fitted to the bowstring. From this, it evolved to mean 'should' or 'expected' because the arrow is 'meant' to fit the string in a certain way. Therefore, 「はずがない」 essentially means something is 'not supposed to be' or 'cannot be' in a certain state.",
    "writeup": "「はずがない」 conveys that a certain outcome or situation is logically not the sole possibility, or it suggests that something is not bound to be true. While often translated as 'hardly possible' or 'unlikely,' its nuance is slightly weaker than those English terms might imply, indicating that a particular state or outcome is not the sole or expected reality. It is frequently used to express a logical conclusion based on given circumstances. Note that 「はずがない」 is different from 「ないはずだ」. 「ないはずだ」 expresses the speaker's opinion that something is almost definitely not true, or 'bound not to be true', which is a stronger negation than 「はずがない」.",
