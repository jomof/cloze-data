    "etymology": "The grammar point combines 「まだ」 (still, not yet) with the て-form of a verb and the negative form of 「いる」 (to be). 「まだ」 indicates that something is still in a state of not being done. The 「ていません」 (polite) or 「ていない」 (plain) form indicates the continuing state of 'not doing'.",
    "writeup": "「まだ〜ていません」 is used to express that something has not been done yet. 「まだ」 means \"still\" or \"not yet,\" and it's combined with the て-form of a verb followed by 「いません」 (polite negative form of 「いる」) or 「いない」 (plain negative form of 「いる」). This structure indicates that an action remains undone at the present time. It follows standard conjugation rules for the て-form.",
