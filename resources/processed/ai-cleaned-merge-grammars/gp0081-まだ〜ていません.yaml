    "etymology": "The grammatical structure of \"まだ〜ていません\" combines the adverb 「まだ」 (mada), meaning \"still\" or \"not yet,\" with the polite negative form of the present progressive aspect. The particle 「て」 links a verb to 「います」 (from 「いる」), which in its negative form 「いません」 indicates that a state or action is *not* ongoing or has *not* been completed. Therefore, the literal meaning is \"the state of still not having done that action.\" This construction efficiently expresses the current, uncompleted state of an action. Its historical development is quite straightforward, arising from the common adverb 「まだ」 combined with the standard negative progressive form.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「まだ〜ていません」 (mada ~ teimasen) is used to convey that an action has not yet been completed. The adverb 「まだ」 here signifies \"still\" or \"not yet,\" and it is followed by the -te form of a verb combined with the polite negative form of the auxiliary verb 「いる」, which is 「いません」. While 「〜ている」 indicates an ongoing state or action, 「〜ていません」 conveys that this state or action has *not* yet been realized or completed. This structure is highly useful for explaining situations where an anticipated or planned action has not yet been carried out, such as \"I haven't finished my homework yet\" or \"I still haven't eaten.\" It is a versatile expression that can be naturally applied in various daily scenarios.",

                    "mitigation": "「食べません」 simply indicates a future negation or a lack of intention to eat, which would sound unnatural when explaining a current state of not having completed a meal. The scene highlights the *uncompleted state* of eating lunch, prompting the use of 「まだ〜ていません」."

In contrast, 「まだ〜ていません」 refers to a state where the action has not been performed at all, meaning it is uncompleted.

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusing these similar expressions, it is crucial to understand the 'tense' and 'state' that each represents. 「まだ〜ていません」 expresses 'incompletion up to the present'. While the standalone 「まだ」 depends on context, when combined with a negative verb form like 「まだ〜ていません」, it emphasizes incompletion. 「Verb[volitional]とする」 indicates 'imminent start' or 'an attempt'. Therefore, it is essential to clearly distinguish between these differences when using them.",
