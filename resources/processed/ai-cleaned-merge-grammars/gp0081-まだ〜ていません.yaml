    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「まだ」 (mada), meaning \"still\" or \"not yet,\" with the 「て」-form of a verb followed by 「いません」 (imasen), the polite negative form of 「いる」 (iru), meaning \"to be\" or \"to exist.\" Thus, it literally translates to \"still not being in the state of having done something.\"",
    "writeup": "「まだ〜ていません」 (mada ~ teimasen) expresses that something has not been done yet. 「まだ」 (mada) means \"still\" or \"not yet,\" and it's combined with the 「て」-form of a verb followed by 「いません」 (imasen), which is the polite negative form of 「いる」 (iru). Think of it as \"I am still not in the state of having done X.\" It's a common and useful way to talk about things you're planning to do but haven't gotten around to yet.",
