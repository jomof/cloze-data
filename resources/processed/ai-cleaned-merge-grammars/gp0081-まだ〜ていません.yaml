    "etymology": "この文法は、「まだ」 (mada) という副詞と、動詞の「て」形に続いて「いません」 (imasen) という「いる」の丁寧な否定形を組み合わせたものです。「まだ」は「依然として」や「未だに」という意味を持ち、「いる」は「存在する」や「〜ている」の形で「状態が続いている」ことを示します。したがって、文字通りには「まだその行為をしていない状態である」という意味合いになります。この構造は、ある行為が完了していない現在の状態を簡潔に表現するために使われます。",
    "writeup": "「まだ〜ていません」 (mada ~ teimasen) は、ある行為がまだ完了していないことを表現する際に用いる文法表現です。ここでの「まだ」は「依然として」や「未だに」という意味合いを持ち、動詞の「て」形に続く「いません」は、動詞の「〜ている」の丁寧な否定形です。つまり、「〜ている」が「ある状態が継続している」ことを示すのに対し、「〜ていません」はその状態がまだ実現していないことを表します。この表現は、「私はまだXをしていません」というように、期待される行動や計画された行動がまだ実行されていない状況を説明するのに非常に役立ちます。例えば、宿題が終わっていない、まだ食事をしていない、といった日常生活の様々な場面で自然に使うことができます。",

                    "mitigation": "The usage of 「まだ〜ていません」 expresses a state where an action has not yet been completed, unlike 「まだ食べません」 which expresses a future intention or a simple negation. 「晩ご飯をまだ食べません」 would imply a lack of intention to eat dinner or an unwillingness to start eating yet. In contrast, 「まだ食べていません」 clearly conveys the current state of not having completed the action of eating dinner, even though it might be the expected time."

While the standalone 「まだ」 depends on context, when combined with a negative verb form like 「まだ〜ていません」, it emphasizes incompletion. 「Verb[volitional]とする」 indicates 'imminent start' or 'an attempt'. Therefore, it is essential to clearly distinguish between these differences when using them.",
