    "etymology": "The grammatical structure of \"まだ〜ていません\" combines the adverb 「まだ」 (mada), meaning \"still\" or \"not yet,\" with the polite negative form of the present progressive aspect. The particle 「て」 links a verb to 「います」 (from 「いる」), which in its negative form 「いません」 indicates that a state or action is *not* ongoing or has *not* been completed. Therefore, the literal meaning is \"the state of still not having done that action.\" This construction efficiently expresses the current, uncompleted state of an action. Its historical development is quite straightforward, arising from the common adverb 「まだ」 combined with the standard negative progressive form.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「まだ〜ていません」 (mada ~ teimasen) is used to convey that an action has not yet been completed. The adverb 「まだ」 here signifies \"still\" or \"not yet,\" and it is followed by the -te form of a verb combined with the polite negative form of the auxiliary verb 「いる」, which is 「いません」. While 「〜ている」 indicates an ongoing state or action, 「〜ていません」 conveys that this state or action has *not* yet been realized or completed. This structure is highly useful for explaining situations where an anticipated or planned action has not yet been carried out, such as \"I haven't finished my homework yet\" or \"I still haven't eaten.\" It is a versatile expression that can be naturally applied in various daily scenarios. The casual form is 「まだ〜ていない」, and past forms include 「まだ〜ていませんでした」 (polite) and 「まだ〜ていなかった」 (casual), all maintaining the core meaning of an uncompleted state or action up to a certain point.",

                    "mitigation": "The phrase 「届きません」 implies a simple negation, either that the email will not arrive or that it does not arrive usually. The scene requires expressing a state of incompletion, where the email was expected but has not yet arrived, necessitating the nuance of 「まだ〜ていません」."

                    "mitigation": "「決めない」 would mean 'we won't decide' or 'we don't decide', implying a lack of intention or regular habit. The scene emphasizes that the decision is *pending* and *has not yet been completed*, which is precisely what 「まだ〜ていない」 conveys."

The scene implies a continuous state of concern due to the uncompleted action."

In contrast, 「まだ〜ていません」 refers to a state where the action has not been performed at all, meaning it is uncompleted. While both involve a temporal aspect, 「まだ〜ていません」 focuses on the *absence of completion*, whereas 「Verb[volitional]とする」 focuses on the *imminence of initiation* or *effort towards an action*."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusing these similar expressions, it is crucial to understand the 'tense' and 'state' that each represents. 「まだ〜ていません」 expresses 'incompletion up to the present'. While the standalone 「まだ」 depends on context, when combined with a negative verb form like 「まだ〜ていません」, it emphasizes incompletion. 「Verb[volitional]とする」 indicates 'imminent start' or 'an attempt'. Therefore, it is essential to clearly distinguish between these differences when using them.",
