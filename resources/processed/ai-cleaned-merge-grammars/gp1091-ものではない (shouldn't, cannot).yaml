Think of it as a stronger, more emphatic way of saying 「～べきではない」 or 「～てはいけない」.\n\nIt's often used to express general truths, social norms, or strong personal feelings about something. For example, 「人に嘘をつくものではない」 (You shouldn't lie to people) expresses a fundamental moral principle.\n\nWhen used with the potential form of a verb, it often indicates that something is simply impossible or unbearable, such as 「彼の歌は聞けたものではない」 (I couldn't bear to listen to his song).",
