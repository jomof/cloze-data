    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことだ」 is derived from 「こと」 (koto), which means 'thing' or 'matter,' combined with the copula 「だ」 (da), which indicates a statement or assertion. The combination creates a nuance of emphasizing the importance or necessity of a certain action or state.",
    "writeup": "「ことだ」 is a sentence-ending particle used to express strong suggestions, advice, or orders. It is often translated as \"should\" or \"ought to\". It's important to understand the level of authority implied when using this construction. Because it carries a tone of authority, it's frequently seen in rules and expectations posted in public places, such as signs in shops or parks. However, it is generally inappropriate to use when giving general advice, especially to someone of higher status.",
