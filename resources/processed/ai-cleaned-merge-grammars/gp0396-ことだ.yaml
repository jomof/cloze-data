    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことだ」 is derived from 「こと」 (koto), which means 'thing' or 'matter,' combined with the copula 「だ」 (da), which indicates a statement or assertion. The combination creates a nuance of emphasizing the importance or necessity of a certain action or state.",
    "writeup": "「ことだ」 is a sentence-ending particle used to express **strong suggestions**, advice, or orders. It is often translated as \"should\" or \"ought to\". It's important to understand the **level of authority implied** when using this construction. Because it carries a **tone of authority**, it's frequently seen in rules and expectations posted in public places, such as signs in shops or parks. However, it is generally **inappropriate to use when giving general advice**, especially to someone of higher status.",
