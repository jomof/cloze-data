        "usage-context": "Used to give strong advice, instructions, or to state a general truth or rule. Implies a certain level of authority.",
        "function": "To provide a strong recommendation, instruction, or to state a general principle.",
        "nuance": "Carries a tone of strong advice or mild obligation, often encountered in rules, guidance, or when emphasizing a common-sense principle. It can also, less commonly, express astonishment or doubt, especially when used by women. This grammar point focuses on the advisory function.",

        "grammatical-role": "Sentence-ending particle expressing recommendation or principle."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことだ」 is derived from 「こと」 (koto), which means 'thing' or 'matter,' combined with the copula 「だ」 (da), which indicates a statement or assertion. The combination creates a nuance of emphasizing the importance or necessity of a certain action or state, evolving from simply stating a fact about a 'matter' to asserting what 'ought to be the matter' or 'the thing to do'.",
    "writeup": "「ことだ」 is a versatile sentence-ending particle that serves primarily to express **strong suggestions**, advice, or instructions. It is most commonly translated as \"should\" or \"ought to\" in English. This construction is frequently used to emphasize an action that is deemed necessary, important, or a general rule.\n\nIt's important to understand the **level of authority implied** when using 「ことだ」. Because it carries a tone of strong advice or mild obligation, it is frequently encountered in rules and expectations posted in public places, such as signs in shops or parks (e.g., 「ごみは持ち帰る**ことだ**。」 - \"You should take your trash home.\"). Due to this authoritative tone, it is generally **inappropriate to use when giving general advice** or suggestions to someone of higher status, as it might sound condescending or overly prescriptive. Instead, it is better suited for situations where you are conveying established rules, universal truths, or strong, well-intentioned advice, particularly to those of equal or lower status, or in self-admonition.\n\nWhile the primary focus of this grammar point is on expressing suggestions or obligations, 「こと」 can also be used, less commonly, to express **astonishment or doubt** (感嘆や疑問). This usage is primarily found in older or more literary Japanese and is generally associated with female speech in modern contexts. For example, 「よく食べる**ことだ**」 could express surprise at someone eating a lot. However, the advisory function is by far its most prevalent use in contemporary Japanese.",
