etymology: The verb '変わる' (kawaru) originates from Old Japanese 'かへる' (kaheru), which meant 'to return'
  or 'to change'. Over time, the meaning evolved and specialized, with '変わる' (intransitive) focusing on
  the internal process of shifting from one state to another, and '変える' (transitive) developing to describe
  the act of causing something else to change. This distinction highlights whether the change is self-initiated
  or externally induced.
writeup: |-
  The verb '変わる' (kawaru) is an **intransitive verb** meaning 'to change', 'to vary', or 'to be transformed'. This means the subject of the sentence itself undergoes the change, without needing a direct object. It is a fundamental verb for expressing any kind of alteration, whether it's a physical transformation, a change in emotion, a shift in plans, or an alteration in circumstances.

  Understanding the intransitive nature of '変わる' is crucial, as it contrasts with its transitive counterpart, '変える' (kaeru), which means 'to change something' or 'to alter'. While '変わる' describes something *becoming* different, '変える' describes *making* something different. For example, '天気が {変わる}' (The weather changes) uses '変わる' because the weather itself undergoes the change. In contrast, 'チャンネルを {変える}' (to change the channel) uses '変える' because an external agent (you) is causing the change to the channel.

  '変わる' can be used in a wide range of contexts, from describing subtle shifts to complete transformations. It is commonly used with particles like 'が' to mark the subject that changes, and 'に' to indicate the new state or form it changes into. For instance, '考え方が {変わる}' (one's way of thinking changes) or '水が氷に {変わる}' (water changes into ice).

  When using '変わる', you are focusing on the *result* of the change or the *process* as it happens to the subject, rather than the agent causing the change. This verb is versatile and can describe both gradual and sudden changes.

  - term: 変える (to change)
    meaning: to change (something), to alter (transitive)

    nuance: While '変わる' is intransitive (the subject changes itself), '変える' is transitive (an agent changes
      something else).

  - term: 移る (to move)
    meaning: to move, to shift (intransitive)
    kind: similar expression

      in location or position.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:移る (to move)
  - term: 変化する (to change)
    meaning: to change, to vary, to undergo a change (more formal/broader)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: '''変わる'' is a common, everyday verb. ''変化する'' is a noun-verb compound, often used in more
      formal or academic contexts, referring to a general concept of change or variation.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:変化する (to change)
post_false_friends_writeup: It is very important to distinguish between '変わる' (intransitive) and '変える'
  (transitive). The key difference lies in whether the subject performs the action of changing itself
  ('変わる') or if an agent performs the action of changing something else ('変える'). For instance, '季節が {変わる}'
  (The seasons change) implies a natural, inherent change, whereas '髪型を {変える}' (to change one's hairstyle)
  implies an intentional act by a person. When thinking about '移る' and '変わる', remember that '移る' is specific
  to movement or shifting place, while '変わる' is a broader term for any kind of transformation. '変化する'
  is a more formal or academic synonym for '変わる', often used when discussing broader, more abstract changes.

post_example_writeup: 'The verb ''変わる'' is versatile and can describe both gradual and sudden changes.
  Pay close attention to the particles used: ''が'' marks the subject that changes, and ''に'' marks the
  state or entity it changes into. For example, ''信号が {青に変わる}'' (the traffic light changes to green) demonstrates
  this usage. The nuances in its usage, especially when compared with ''変える'', come from whether the change
  is self-initiated or externally caused. Mastering this distinction is key to natural Japanese expression.'
