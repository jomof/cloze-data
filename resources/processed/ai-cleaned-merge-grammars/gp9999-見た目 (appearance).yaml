jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to describe the external, visual aspect of something or someone. It encompasses
    physical attributes and the general impression an object or person gives.
  function: To state or refer to the visual appearance of a subject.
  nuance: Often implies a judgment based solely on looks. Can be used positively or negatively, sometimes
    contrasting with the actual internal quality or nature. It focuses specifically on the visual perception.
etymology: The term `見た目` is derived from the verb `見る` (miru - to see) in its past tense form `見た` (mita),
  meaning 'seen,' combined with the noun `目` (me), which here functions as a suffix indicating 'aspect'
  or 'appearance.' This formation is similar to other Japanese words like `早め` (hayame - on the early
  side) or `遅め` (osome - on the late side). `見た目` literally translates to 'that which has been seen by
  the eye,' thereby referring to the outward visual impression.
writeup: '`見た目` refers to the outward, visual appearance of something or someone. It encompasses everything
  that can be perceived with the eyes, from physical attributes to the general impression an object or
  person gives. This term is often used when discussing how things look on the surface, sometimes contrasting
  with their actual content, quality, or inner nature. For instance, food might have a `見た目` that is not
  appealing but be surprisingly delicious, or conversely, look exquisite but taste bland. It highlights
  the superficial visual aspect, whether that''s a positive or negative connotation depending on the context.
  This noun is gender-neutral and can be used across various registers, though it tends to be more common
  in everyday, conversational settings rather than highly formal or academic discourse.'

  - term: 見かけ
    meaning: outward appearance, looks
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`見かけ` is very close in meaning and often interchangeable with `見た目`. However, `見かけ` tends
      to emphasize the superficiality or the act of ''seeming'' more, often carrying a slightly stronger
      implication of deception or that things are not as they appear. For example, `見かけ倒し` means ''deceptive
      appearance.'' `見た目` is generally more neutral, simply stating ''what it looks like.'' Additionally,
      `見かけ` can also be used as a verb stem `見かける` (to happen to see), which `見た目` cannot.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:見かけ (outward appearance)
  - term: 外見
    meaning: external appearance, outward form
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`外見` is a more formal and broader term for ''external appearance'' or ''outward form.'' It
      encompasses not just visual aspects but also other superficial characteristics, making it suitable
      for more objective, academic, or formal contexts. While `見た目` strictly focuses on the visual impression,
      `外見` can refer to a more comprehensive external presentation. For instance, when talking about the
      external design of a building or a person''s overall exterior presentation, `外見` might be preferred.'
    grammar_point: 外見 (external appearance)
  - term: 様子
    meaning: state, situation, appearance, aspect
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While `様子` can sometimes refer to 'appearance' in a general sense, it more broadly describes
      the overall state, condition, situation, or demeanor of a person or thing. It often includes non-visual
      cues like atmosphere, behavior, or even sound, reflecting a more dynamic and comprehensive 'look'
      or 'feel' of something. `見た目` is strictly limited to the visual, static impression.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:様子 (state・situation)
post_false_friends_writeup: While `見た目`, `見かけ`, `外見`, and `様子` all pertain to aspects of how things appear,
  their usage varies. `見た目` is a common, neutral term for visual appearance. `見かけ` carries a slight implication
  of superficiality or potential discrepancy between appearance and reality. `外見` is a more formal and
  comprehensive term for external characteristics. `様子` describes the overall state, condition, or demeanor,
  which can include non-visual elements. By understanding these nuances, you can select the most precise
  term to convey your intended meaning in Japanese.

    scene: A person is hesitant to try a cake because it doesn't look appealing, but someone encourages
      them to taste it.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This example highlights the common use of `見た目` to contrast initial visual perception with
      actual quality or taste. The phrase `見た目 は 悪い けど` implies that while the appearance might be unappealing,
      the true quality is different.

          neutral term for visual appearance in general.'
    scene: A teacher is giving advice to students about job interviews or social interactions.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This sentence uses `見た目` in a more general, informative context to discuss the significance

    register: casual
    setting: instructional
