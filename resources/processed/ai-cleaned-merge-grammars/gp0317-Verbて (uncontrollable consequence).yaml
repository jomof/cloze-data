  particle-syntactic-function: conjunctive
  particle-pragmatic-function: confirmation
  usage-context: General
  function: expresses cause and effect
  nuance: implies the result is often uncontrollable or unavoidable
etymology: The 「て」 form originally functioned as a conjunctive particle, linking clauses together. Over
  time, it developed the nuance of indicating cause and effect, particularly when the result (the second
  clause) is something less controllable by the speaker.
writeup: The 「て」-form of a verb (or 「で」 for nouns and な-adjectives) can express the meaning of "because,"
  "due to," or "since." This usage often implies that the speaker did not have control over the outcome
  described in the second part of the sentence. The first part of the sentence (A) provides the reason
  or cause, and the second part (B) describes the resulting situation or feeling. This grammar point emphasizes
  the uncontrollable nature of the (B) statement, suggesting that (A) led to (B) in a way that the speaker
  couldn't prevent or easily influence. It is useful for expressing feelings like being troubled, happy,
  surprised, tired, or worried as a result of some preceding action or state. For nouns and な-adjectives,
  the particle 「で」 is used instead of 「て」.
false_friends:
  - term: から (kara)
    meaning: Because, so; indicates a direct and explicit reason.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「から」 explicitly states a reason, often with a stronger emphasis or a more direct causal link,
      and can be used for things within the speaker's control. 「て」, in this usage, highlights a cause-and-effect
      relationship where the result is often uncontrollable by the speaker.
    grammar_point: から (reason cause)
  - term: ので (node)
    meaning: Because, so; indicates a softer, more objective or polite reason.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ので」 is generally softer and more polite than 「から」, presenting a reason as objective fact.
      While it also indicates cause, it doesn't carry the same nuance of an uncontrollable or unavoidable
      outcome as 「て」 in this context.
    grammar_point: ので (reason)
  - term: なくて (nakute)
    meaning: Not ~ and, Not so, Because not; indicates a negative state as the cause.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なくて」 is the negative form of 「て」, indicating that the *absence* of something is the cause,
      whereas 「て」 (or 「で」) indicates the *presence* of something as the cause.
    grammar_point: なくて (conjunction)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between 「て」 in this usage and similar expressions, remember
  that 「て」 emphasizes a direct cause-and-effect relationship where the consequence is often beyond the
  speaker's control. 「から」 provides a more explicit and direct reason, applicable to both controllable
  and uncontrollable outcomes. 「ので」 offers a softer, more objective reason. Finally, 「なくて」 is simply the
  negative counterpart of 「て」, indicating an absence as the cause.
examples:
  - english: I studied a lot yesterday, so I'm sleepy today.
    japanese:
      - 昨日 たくさん 勉強 し {て}、今日 は 眠い です。
      - 昨日 たくさん 勉強 し {て}、今日 は 眠い。
      - 昨日 ずいぶん 勉強 し {て}、今日 は 眠く なっ て しまい まし た。
    english_literally: Having studied a lot yesterday, today I am sleepy.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 たくさん 勉強 し た から、今日 は 眠い です。
        english: Because I studied a lot yesterday, I'm sleepy today.
        hint: While both convey cause and effect, 「から」 states a direct reason. The て-form here highlights
          the uncontrollable consequence of being sleepy, often used when the outcome is a natural, unavoidable
          result of the first action. We're looking for a natural, unavoidable result.
    scene: A student explains their tiredness after an exam.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The uncontrollable state of being sleepy (「眠い」) is a direct consequence of the action of studying
      (「勉強して」). This simple statement is common from a younger speaker who may not manage their study
      habits effectively.
    etymology: The conjunctive use of て-form to show cause-and-effect has been present in Japanese since
      classical periods, emphasizing sequence and connection rather than explicit reasoning.
  - english: Japan is hot, so my sweat won't stop.
    japanese:
      - 日本 が 熱く {て}、汗 が 止まり ませ ん。
      - 日本 が 熱く {て}、汗 が 止まら ない。
      - 日本 が 熱く {て}、もう 汗 が ダラダラ です。
    english_literally: Japan being hot, sweat doesn't stop.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 が 熱い から、汗 が 止まり ませ ん。
        english: Because Japan is hot, my sweat won't stop.
        hint: 「から」 gives a direct reason. However, the て-form used here emphasizes the uncontrollable
          nature of the sweating due to the heat, suggesting a natural and unavoidable reaction. We're
          looking for an unavoidable physical reaction.
    scene: A tourist complains about the intense summer heat in Japan.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The uncontrollable heat (「熱くて」) in Japan directly leads to the uncontrollable sweating (「汗が止まりません」).
      This expresses a physical reaction beyond the speaker's will. The use of 「熱くて」 (hot and...) as the
      cause emphasizes the inherent quality leading to the effect.
    etymology: The い-adjective + て construction for cause-and-effect highlights the state itself as the
      direct reason, a usage deeply rooted in the grammatical evolution of adjectival forms.
  - english: The room is clean, so I feel good.
    japanese:
      - 部屋 が きれい {で}、気持ち が いい です。
      - 部屋 が きれい {で}、気持ち が いい。
      - 部屋 が きれい {で}、気分 が 爽やか です。
    english_literally: The room being clean, I feel good.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 部屋 が きれい だ から、気持ち が いい です。
        english: Because the room is clean, I feel good.
        hint: 「から」 explains the reason. The で-form (from な-adjective/noun + て) here connects the state
          of the room directly to the uncontrollable positive feeling, implying it's a natural consequence.
          We're looking for a natural consequence of the room's state.
    scene: Someone expresses satisfaction with their tidy living space.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: optimistic
    nuance: The clean state of the room (「きれいで」) directly causes the feeling of pleasantness (「気持ちがいいです」).
      This is a polite expression of a positive and natural consequence. The な-adjective/Noun + で form
      links a descriptive state to an emotion.
    etymology: The particle 「で」 for nouns and な-adjectives, when indicating cause, evolved from its locative
      and instrumental functions, extending to express the 'state' or 'condition' from which something
      results.
  - english: My head hurts because of a cold.
    japanese:
      - 風邪 {で}、頭 が 痛い。
      - 風邪 {で}、頭 が 痛い です。
      - 風邪 {で}、頭 が ズキズキ する。
    english_literally: Because of a cold, my head is painful.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 風邪 だ から、頭 が 痛い。
        english: Because it's a cold, my head hurts.
        hint: While 「から」 provides a reason, the で-form (for nouns) here specifically points to the uncontrollable
          cold as the direct cause of the headache, implying an unavoidable physical discomfort. We're
          looking for the unavoidable cause of the headache.
    scene: A person describes their cold symptoms to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The cold (「風邪で」) is the direct, uncontrollable cause of the headache (「頭が痛い」). This is a straightforward
      expression of an unavoidable physical discomfort. Using 「で」 with a noun like 「風邪」 points to the
      noun itself as the source of the trouble.
    etymology: This usage of 「で」 with nouns to denote cause is a natural extension of its function as
      an instrumental particle, where the noun is the 'means' or 'agent' of the consequence.
  - english: The bus didn't come, so I was late.
    japanese:
      - バス が 来 なく {て}、遅れ まし た。
      - バス が 来 なく {て}、遅れ た。
      - バス が 来 なく {て}、参っ た よ。
    english_literally: The bus not coming, I was late.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - バス が 来 なかっ た から、遅れ まし た。
        english: Because the bus didn't come, I was late.
        hint: 「から」 states a direct reason. The なくて-form emphasizes that the uncontrollable absence of
          the bus was the unavoidable cause of being late. We're looking for an uncontrollable external
          event causing the lateness.
    scene: Someone explains their tardiness due to public transport.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: The uncontrollable situation of the bus not arriving (「来なくて」) directly resulted in being late.
      This demonstrates the use of the negative て-form to express cause and effect for an undesirable,
      unavoidable situation. 「来なくて」 explicitly states the *absence* of the action as the cause.
    etymology: The negative て-form 「～なくて」 for cause-and-effect similarly highlights the non-occurrence
      or lack of something as the unavoidable preceding condition.
  - english: I passed the exam, so I was happy.
    japanese:
      - 試験 に 受かっ {て}、嬉しかっ た です。
      - 試験 に 受かっ {て}、嬉しかっ た。
      - 試験 に 合格 し {て}、ホッ と し まし た。
    english_literally: Having passed the exam, I was happy.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 に 受かっ た から、嬉しかっ た です。
        english: Because I passed the exam, I was happy.
        hint: 「から」 explains the reason. The て-form here connects the action of passing the exam to the
          uncontrollable feeling of happiness, indicating a natural and unavoidable emotional response.
          We're looking for a natural emotional response to passing.
    scene: A student shares good news about their exam results with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The positive outcome of passing the exam (「試験に受かって」) leads to the uncontrollable feeling of
      happiness (「嬉しかったです」). This is a common and natural expression of relief and joy. This shows that
      the 'uncontrollable' outcome can also be positive.
    etymology: The versatility of the て-form allows it to connect various types of causes to their effects,
      including positive outcomes leading to positive emotions.
  - english: It rained, so the game couldn't be played.
    japanese:
      - 雨 が 降っ {て}、試合 が でき なく なり まし た。
      - 雨 が 降っ {て}、試合 が でき なく なっ た。
      - 雨 が 降っ {て}、試合 は 中止 と なり まし た。
    english_literally: Having rained, the game became unable to be played.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 が 降っ た から、試合 が でき なく なり まし た。
        english: Because it rained, the game couldn't be played.
        hint: 「から」 provides a direct reason. The て-form highlights the uncontrollable natural event (rain)
          as the unavoidable cause for the game's cancellation. We're looking for an uncontrollable natural
          event causing the cancellation.
    scene: A sports coach informs their team about a game cancellation.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The rain (「降って」) is the direct, uncontrollable cause for the game becoming unable to be played
      (「できなくなりました」). This formal phrasing is appropriate for conveying an important, unavoidable change.
      The use of 「～て」 clearly indicates a factual, external cause leading to a state beyond control.
    etymology: The use of the て-form to describe natural phenomena as causes (like rain) leading to consequences
      (like game cancellation) is a core function, illustrating nature's 'uncontrollable' influence.
  - english: My child has a fever, so I'm worried.
    japanese:
      - 子供 が 熱 を 出し {て}、心配 です。
      - 子供 が 熱 を 出し {て}、心配 だ わ。
      - 子供 が 熱 を 出し {て} おり、大変 心配 し て おり ます。
    english_literally: My child having a fever, I am worried.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 が 熱 を 出し た から、心配 です。
        english: Because my child has a fever, I'm worried.
        hint: While 「から」 provides a direct reason, the て-form emphasizes the uncontrollable nature of
          the child's fever leading to the worry, highlighting an unavoidable emotional response to an
          external event. We're looking for an unavoidable emotional response.
    scene: A parent talks to a friend about their child's health.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The uncontrollable event of the child having a fever (「熱を出して」) causes the parent's uncontrollable
      feeling of worry (「心配です」). This is a common and natural expression of parental concern, showing
      an emotional consequence of an external situation. This kind of expression of concern for family
      members is very common among female speakers.
    etymology: The te-form's ability to express cause and effect for emotional states is a well-established
      usage, reflecting the direct impact of external situations on one's feelings.
  - english: The road was slippery, so I fell.
    japanese:
      - 道 が 滑り やすく {て}、転ん で しまい まし た。
      - 道 が 滑り やすく {て}、転ん だ。
      - 道 が ツルツル {で}、派手 に 転ん じゃっ た よ。
    english_literally: The road being slippery, I fell.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 道 が 滑り やすかっ た から、転ん で しまい まし た。
        english: Because the road was slippery, I fell.
        hint: 「から」 explains the reason, but the て-form (from an い-adjective) here stresses that the slippery
          condition of the road directly and unavoidably led to the fall. We're looking for an unavoidable
          consequence of an environmental condition.
    scene: Someone recounts an unexpected accident to a colleague.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The uncontrollable condition of the slippery road (「滑りやすくて」) directly led to the unavoidable
      action of falling (「転んでしまいました」). This emphasizes the external cause and the consequence that happened
      despite the speaker's will. The phrase 「転んでしまいました」 is a common way for any speaker to express a
      regrettable, completed action.
    etymology: The combination of い-adjective + て as a conjunctive form for causality has been a stable
      grammatical pattern, efficiently linking a quality to its unavoidable outcome.
  - english: I haven't eaten anything all day, so I'm starving.
    japanese:
      - 今日 は 何 も 食べ {なく て}、お腹 が ペコペコ です。
      - 今日 は 何 も 食べ {なく て}、お腹 が ペコペコ だ。
      - 今日 何 も 食べ て {なく て}、腹 減っ たー！
    english_literally: Today not having eaten anything, my stomach is very empty.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 何 も 食べ なかっ た から、お腹 が ペコペコ です。
        english: Because I haven't eaten anything all day, I'm starving.
        hint: While 「から」 states the reason directly, the なくて-form emphasizes the lack of action (not eating)
          as the unavoidable cause of the hunger. We're looking for a state resulting from a lack of action.
    scene: A friend complains about hunger after a busy day without meals.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The uncontrollable state of not having eaten (「食べなくて」) results in the extreme hunger (「お腹がペコペコです」).
      This uses the negative て-form to express a natural, albeit self-inflicted, uncontrollable physical
      state. 「ペコペコ」 is a colloquial, onomatopoeic word for being very hungry, commonly used in casual
      conversation by younger female speakers.
    etymology: The negative te-form's causal function underscores the impact of non-occurrence, a linguistic
      mechanism that allows for expressing consequences arising from an absence of action or state.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, the て-form (and で for nouns/な-adjectives) effectively
  conveys a cause-and-effect relationship where the consequence is often a natural or unavoidable outcome
  of the preceding cause. This grammatical construction is particularly useful for expressing feelings
  or situations that arise spontaneously or beyond one's direct will.
