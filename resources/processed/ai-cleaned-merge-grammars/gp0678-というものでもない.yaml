    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of several elements: 「と」 (a particle indicating quotation), 「言う」 (iu, 'to say'), 「もの」 (mono, 'thing'), 「で」 (de, a particle indicating the state or condition), and 「はない」 (wa nai, 'is not'). Literally, it suggests 'It is not something that can be said for sure'.",
    "writeup": "「というものでもない」 indicates that something is not guaranteed or is not necessarily true. It suggests that while something might often be the case, there are exceptions or circumstances where it does not hold true.\n\nThe literal meaning, considering its components, is similar to \"it's not a thing that one can say is (A)\". Replacing 「は」 with 「も」 adds slight emphasis.\n\nWhile it can follow words in their standard form, nouns and na-adjectives may occasionally be preceded by 「だ」. Often, this grammar pattern is preceded by phrases including 「であれば」, emphasizing that even if (A) is true, (B) is not necessarily true.",
