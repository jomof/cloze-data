    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from a combination of several components: 「と」 (a particle indicating a quote or condition), 「言う」 (iu, the verb 'to say'), 「もの」 (mono, 'thing'), 「で」 (de, a particle indicating state), and 「はない」 (wa nai, 'is not'). Literally, it can be understood as 'it's not something that one can say is...'.",
    "writeup": "「というものでもない」 is an expression that indicates there is no guarantee something is true, or that it is not necessarily the case. The nuance is that while something might often be expected, there are exceptions. This expression carries a formal and somewhat stiff nuance, often used in written contexts or more serious discussions.\n\n「は」 may be replaced with 「も」, with a slight change in emphasis. As with many grammar patterns, the version with 「も」 will be considered a bit more emphatic, suggesting \"it's not even the case that...\". It can follow any word in its standard form, but may be preceded by 「だ」 when used with nouns or な-adjectives, though this is not strictly required.\n\nOften, sentences using this grammar pattern are preceded by phrases including 「であれば」. These sentences merely emphasize the fact that \"even if it's (A), it doesn't necessarily mean that (B)\".",

            "nuance": "A parent (older) advises their child (younger) on common societal expectations regarding education and employment. The use of 「というものでもない」 refutes the assumption that a good university degree automatically guarantees a good job, conveying a nuanced, realistic perspective."
