        "source": "Bunpro, DOJG"
    },
    "etymology": "The construction お/ご〜になる combines a polite prefix (お or ご) with the verb 「なる」 (to become). Adding 「お」 or 「ご」 before a verb stem elevates the politeness level. Then 「〜になる」 indicates a change of state or action, but in this case, it is used to elevate the action itself to a more respectful level. This indirectness is a common strategy in polite expressions.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「お〜になる」 (or 「ご〜になる」) is used to express profound respect for the actions of someone of higher status than yourself. It is **never** used when talking about your own actions. The 「〜になる」 part functions similarly to 「する」, attaching to the ます-stem of a verb, thereby transforming a direct action into a state of 'becoming' that action, which lends an air of indirectness and thus, politeness.\n\nThe choice between 「お」 and 「ご」 is crucial and generally depends on the origin of the verb's stem. 「お」 is typically used with verbs of Japanese origin (訓読み - kun-yomi), while 「ご」 is used with verbs of Chinese origin (音読み - on-yomi). However, there are exceptions, so careful attention to usage is advised.\n\nFor instance, some verbs, like 「おいでになる」 (the 「お〜になる」 form of 「いる・来る・行く」), are almost exclusively used in honorific language. 「おいでになる」 can flexibly mean 'to come,' 'to go,' or 'to be,' depending on the context, signifying the speaker's respectful perspective toward the subject's movement or presence.",

            "nuance": "「いらっしゃる」 is an irregular honorific verb that directly replaces 「いる」, 「来る」, and 「行く」. In contrast, 「お〜になる」 is a general pattern applicable to many verbs, where 「なる」 is appended to the verb stem after adding お/ご. While both convey honorific intent, 「いらっしゃる」 is a specific verb replacement, whereas 「お〜になる」 is a productive construction."

            "nuance": "「なさる」 is an irregular honorific verb that directly replaces 「する」 (to do). While 「お〜になる」 can also be used to make verbs honorific, it is a general construction, whereas 「なさる」 is specifically for the verb 「する」. For example, 「お勉強になる」 (to respectfully study) vs. 「勉強なさる」 (to respectfully study). Both are honorific, but 「なさる」 is more idiomatic for 「する」."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「いらっしゃる」 and 「なさる」 are specific honorific verbs that replace common verbs like 「いる/来る/行く」 and 「する」 respectively, 「お〜になる」 is a versatile grammatical pattern. This pattern can be applied to a wider range of verbs by attaching お or ご to their stem and then adding 「になる」. Understanding this distinction helps in choosing the most appropriate honorific expression: use the specific irregular honorific verbs when they apply, and 「お〜になる」 for other verbs to show respect for the subject's actions.",
