    },
    "etymology": "The construction お/ご〜になる combines a polite prefix (お or ご) with the verb 「なる」 (to become). Adding 「お」 or 「ご」 before a verb stem elevates the politeness level. Then 「〜になる」 indicates a change of state or action, but in this case, it is used to elevate the action itself to a more respectful level.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「お〜になる」 (or 「ご〜になる」) is used to express respect for the actions of someone of higher status than yourself. It is **never** used when talking about your own actions. The 「〜になる」 part functions similarly to 「する」, attaching to the ます-stem of a verb. \n\nThe choice between 「お」 and 「ご」 depends on the origin of the verb. 「お」 is generally used with words of Japanese origin (kun-yomi), while 「ご」 is used with words of Chinese origin (on-yomi). However, there are exceptions, so pay close attention.\n\nNote that some verbs, like 「おいでになる」 (the 「お〜になる」 form of 「いる・来る・行く」), are almost exclusively used in honorific language. 「おいでになる」 can mean 'to come,' 'to go,' or 'to be,' depending on the context.",
