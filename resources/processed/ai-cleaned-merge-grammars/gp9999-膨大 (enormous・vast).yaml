details:
  part-of-speech: adjective
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to describe quantities, scale, volume, or abstract concepts that are significantly
    large. Often implies an overwhelming or impressive magnitude.
  function: To express an immense scale, quantity, or volume.
  nuance: Carries a sense of overwhelming, often unmanageable, or impressive magnitude. It goes beyond
    simply 'big' to suggest a scale that is considerable or extensive.
etymology: 'The word 「膨大」 is composed of two kanji: 「膨」 (bō), which means "to swell, expand, inflate,"
  and 「大」 (dai), meaning "large, great." This combination literally paints a picture of something that
  has swelled to a great size, perfectly capturing the essence of "enormous" or "vast." It signifies a
  bigness that has expanded or accumulated to an impressive or overwhelming degree.'
writeup: |-
  「膨大」 (ぼうだい) is a な-adjective used to describe something that is enormous, vast, or immense in scale, quantity, or volume. Unlike general terms for "big" like 「大きい」 (おおきい), 「膨大」 often carries a nuance of an overwhelming, unmanageable, or impressively grand magnitude. It is frequently applied to abstract concepts such as data, budget, information, or workload, as well as to physical objects when their size is particularly grand or extensive.

  When used to modify a noun, it takes the form 「膨大なX」. For example, 「膨大なデータ」 (bōdai na dēta) means "enormous data." When used as a predicate, it would be 「データは膨大だ」 (dēta wa bōdai da) meaning "the data is enormous." While it can function adverbially with 「に」, this is less common with 「膨大」 itself, as other adverbs are often preferred for expressing 'in a large amount' or 'greatly'.

  「膨大」 emphasizes the sheer scale or quantity, suggesting that the amount or size is considerably larger than what is typical or easily managed. It can imply a challenge, a significant impact, or simply a remarkable scale due to its magnitude. For instance, a "vast amount of information" (膨大な情報) suggests an overwhelming quantity, not just a lot.

  - term: 大きい
    meaning: big, large
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「大きい」 is a general term for size, applicable to anything large. 「膨大」 specifically implies
      an immense, overwhelming quantity or scale, often for abstract concepts like data or budget, suggesting
      a magnitude beyond simple bigness.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:大きい (big, large)
  - term: 巨大
    meaning: gigantic, enormous, huge
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「巨大」 typically refers to physical size or structures, emphasizing immense bulk. While 「膨大」
      can describe physical objects, it is more broadly applicable to abstract quantities (e.g., data,
      budget) and emphasizes volume or quantity that has swelled.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:巨大 (gigantic)
  - term: 大量
    meaning: large quantity, large amount
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「大量」 strictly refers to quantity or volume. 「膨大」 also applies to quantity but can encompass
      scale and scope beyond just countable units, often with a nuance of being overwhelming or vast.
      「大量」 is neutral; 「膨大」 often suggests impressiveness or difficulty due to its immense size.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:大量 (large quantity)
  - term: 莫大
    meaning: enormous, immense, vast (especially for money, assets)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「莫大」 is very close in meaning to 「膨大」 and can be interchangeable in some contexts, but it
      has a stronger and almost exclusive association with intangible, often financial, amounts like money,
      costs, or assets. 「膨大」 has broader applicability to both physical and abstract things beyond finances.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:莫大 (enormous, for money)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「膨大」, 「大きい」, 「巨大」, 「大量」, and 「莫大」 all convey a sense of "much" or "big,"
  their specific applications and nuances differ. 「大きい」 is the most general term for size. 「巨大」 tends
  to emphasize physical, immense structures. 「大量」 focuses purely on quantity. 「莫大」, while very similar
  to 「膨大」, is almost exclusively used for immense abstract values, particularly money or financial figures.
  「膨大」, on the other hand, captures the idea of something having "swelled" to a vast or overwhelming extent,
  applicable to both concrete and abstract concepts like data, information, or workload, making it more
  versatile than 「莫大」 for non-financial contexts. Choosing the right term depends on the precise nature
  of what is "enormous" and the specific nuance you wish to convey.

        english: This company handles a big amount of customer data.
        hint: 「大きい」 is a general term for size. While the data might be 'big,' 「膨大」 emphasizes the overwhelming
          or immense quantity, which is often the intended meaning when discussing data.

  periods. It always implies a magnitude that is significant, often to the point of being overwhelming
  or remarkably vast.
