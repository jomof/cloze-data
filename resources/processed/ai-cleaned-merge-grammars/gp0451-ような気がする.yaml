    "etymology": "「よう」 is an auxiliary verb indicating resemblance or approximation. 「気」 means 'feeling' or 'sense,' and 「する」 is the verb 'to do.' Therefore, 「ような気がする」 literally translates to 'to do a feeling of resembling,' implying a sense that something is likely but not certain.",
    "writeup": "「ような気がする」 is a phrase used to express a feeling or sense about something, but with a degree of uncertainty. It combines the basic meaning of 「気がする」, which is 'to have a feeling that (A)' or 'to give off a vibe that (A),' with the auxiliary verb 「よう」, adding a layer of vagueness. This construction conveys 'to have a funny feeling that (A)' or 'to kinda have a feeling that (A).' The 「よう」 particle must attach to the attributive form of the word it modifies.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「気がする」 is stronger than 「ような気がする」. Use 「ような気がする」 when you are not entirely sure about something and want to avoid sounding overly assertive or rude.",
