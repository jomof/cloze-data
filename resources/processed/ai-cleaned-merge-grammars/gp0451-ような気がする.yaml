    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of several parts: 「よう」 (you), which adds a sense of resemblance or approximation ('like', 'as if'); 「な」 (na), a connecting particle used with 'よう' to modify a noun; 「気」 (ki), meaning 'feeling', 'spirit', or 'sense'; 「が」 (ga), a subject marker; and 「する」 (suru), meaning 'to do' or 'to feel'. Together, they create a phrase that expresses a vague feeling or intuition, where the speaker is not entirely certain but has a subtle sense about something, literally 'a feeling like something exists/happens'.",
    "writeup": "「ような気がする」 is a phrase used to express a **vague feeling or intuition**. It conveys a sense that something *might* be the case, but without strong conviction, making it weaker than simply stating 「気がする」. The auxiliary 「よう」 adds a layer of uncertainty, suggesting 'it seems like' or 'I kinda have a feeling that.' This nuanced expression is often employed when the speaker is not entirely certain about something, or when they wish to avoid sounding overly assertive or rude by stating a strong opinion. It generally attaches to verbs in their dictionary form, nouns followed by 「の」, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives followed by 「な」.",
