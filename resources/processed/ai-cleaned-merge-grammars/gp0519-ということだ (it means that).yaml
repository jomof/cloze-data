jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: General
  nuance: Implies a high degree of certainty or factual confirmation from the speaker, indicating the
    information is known or established. It can be used to report information received from a source or
    to explain the meaning of something. More formal than そうだ when reporting hearsay.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a nominalizer, turning a preceding phrase or sentence into a noun clause
    that serves as the predicate, signifying 'it is the case that...' or 'the meaning is...'
etymology: The phrase 「ということだ」 is derived from the combining form of the verb 「言う」 (iu, to say), the noun
  「事」 (koto, thing/matter), and the copula 「だ」 (da, to be). Literally, it translates to 'it is the matter
  of saying [X]', which evolves to convey the sense of 'it is said that [X]' or 'it means that [X]'. The
  inclusion of 「だ」 emphasizes the factual nature or certainty of the reported information or explanation.
writeup: |-
  「ということだ」 is a versatile grammar point used to convey information that the speaker has heard from another source, or to explain the meaning or implication of a preceding statement or situation. It can be translated as "it is said that," "I heard that," "rumor has it that," or "it means that."

  Unlike the more casual 「そうだ」 which often carries a nuance of speculation or less certainty, 「ということだ」 implies a higher degree of factual confirmation or established knowledge. The 「だ」 (or 「です」 in polite form) component emphasizes this certainty, making the statement sound more authoritative and reliable.

  This grammar point is frequently paired with phrases that explicitly state the source of the information, such as 「～によると」 (ni yoru to, according to ~) or 「～によれば」 (ni yo reba, according to ~). When used in this manner, it functions to present a report or finding from a specific source as a confirmed fact.

  While often used for hearsay, it can also be used to draw a conclusion or explain the meaning of a situation. For example, if someone states a fact, using 「ということだ」 can explain what that fact implies. For instance, 「彼 は 日本語 を 話せる ということだ」 (kare wa nihongo o hanaseru to iu koto da) could mean "It is said that he can speak Japanese" (hearsay) or "It means that he can speak Japanese" (explaining an implication). The context usually clarifies the intended nuance.

  It is generally considered more formal than 「そうだ」 when reporting information that has been heard. When expressing hearsay that cannot be easily proven, or when the emphasis is more on the source than the information itself, 「とのことだ」 can sometimes be used as a slightly softer alternative, which also emphasizes the origin of the information.
false_friends:
  - term: ことなの
    meaning: (A) is (Description of A), (A) means that (Description of A)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ことなの」 is an explanatory nominalizer that literally translates to 'it is a matter of (X)',
      whereas 「ということだ」 reports what has been said about something or explains its meaning from an objective
      standpoint. 「ことなの」 is more about defining a concept or action, typically in a casual explanatory
      context, while 「ということだ」 is more about reporting or concluding.
    grammar_point: ことなの (it is that)
  - term: だって
    meaning: I heard/was said, Because, But, Even or also, Even if or even though
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「だって」 can be a very informal way to report hearsay (often with a nuance of complaint or defense),
      but it has many other meanings like "because" or "even if." Unlike 「ということだ」, which solely conveys
      information or explanation, 「だって」 has a broader range of uses and often implies a personal emotional
      context or reason that 「ということだ」 does not carry.
    grammar_point: だって (even・too)
  - term: とか
    meaning: I heard that… something like, They said ... or something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とか」 indicates uncertainty or vagueness about the information or its source, often used to
      list examples without being exhaustive. In contrast, 「ということだ」 presents information as relatively
      certain and confirmed, even if heard from someone else. 「とか」 implies 'I heard something like that,'
      while 「ということだ」 implies 'I heard that, and it is the case that...'.
    grammar_point: とか (hearsay)
  - term: ということ
    meaning: ~ing, The ~ that ~ (Nominalization)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ということ」 without the copula 「だ」 primarily functions as a nominalizer, turning a preceding phrase
      or sentence into a noun clause, often meaning 'the fact that ~' or 'the act of ~ing'. It does not
      carry the sense of hearsay or explanation on its own. 「ということだ」 adds the copula to state 'it *is*
      the fact that ~' or 'it *means* that ~', completing the statement with an assertion or conclusion.
    grammar_point: ということ (nominalizer・conclusion)
  - term: そうだ (hear that)
    meaning: I heard that; It is said that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そうだ」 is generally less formal than 「ということだ」 when reporting hearsay and can imply more speculation
      or a less definite source. 「ということだ」 typically suggests a higher degree of certainty and is often
      used for official reports or established facts, while 「そうだ」 might be used for common rumors or less
      verified information. 「そうだ」 can also indicate something 'seems' or 'looks like,' a meaning 「ということだ」
      does not have.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]そうだ (I hear that)'
  - term: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems・I hear)'
    meaning: Seems like; I heard that; apparently
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「らしい」 indicates that the information is based on observation or inference, implying a weaker,
      more speculative form of hearsay compared to the more assertive and certain 「ということだ」. While both
      can convey 'I heard,' 「らしい」 means 'it seems like,' focusing on outward appearance or indirect evidence,
      whereas 「ということだ」 states 'it is said that,' focusing on a confirmed report or meaning.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems・I hear)'
  - term: というわけではない
    meaning: It doesn't mean that, It is not the case, It's not like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ということだ」 states a conclusion or reported fact, while 「というわけではない」 negates the idea that something
      is necessarily true. It denies an absolute conclusion.
    grammar_point: (という)わけではない (it's not that...)
  - term: に決まっている
    meaning: It is surely the case; It is bound to be; It is certainly true.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both express certainty. 「に決まっている」 conveys the speaker's strong conviction or subjective certainty,
      often based on strong logical deduction or intuition. 「ということだ」 is more about reporting an objective
      fact, established meaning, or information received from a reliable source.
    grammar_point: に決まっている (surely is)
  - term: といわれている
    meaning: It is said that, Is known as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「といわれている」 emphasizes that something is widely said or generally accepted, often referring
      to common knowledge or public opinion. 「ということだ」 can also report what is said, but its emphasis is
      more on *the fact* of what is being stated or its logical conclusion, and it can also explain meaning
      or implication. 「といわれている」 implies a more general, perhaps less direct, source.
    grammar_point: といわれている (it is said that)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between 「ということだ」 and similar expressions, remember that 「ということだ」
  serves to present information as a confirmed report or a clear explanation of meaning. It carries a
  sense of certainty and often implies that the information is established or comes from a reliable source.
  In contrast, 「そうだ」, 「らしい」, and 「といわれている」 imply varying degrees of hearsay or general acceptance, with
  「らしい」 often being the least certain and based on observation, and 「といわれている」 emphasizing general knowledge
  or public opinion rather than a speaker's direct assertion of meaning. 「ことなの」 and 「ということ」 primarily
  function as nominalizers or for general explanation without the definitive assertion that 「ということだ」 provides.
  「だって」 and 「とか」 have broader applications beyond simply reporting information, often carrying nuances
  of reason, examples, or uncertainty that are not inherent to 「ということだ」. Lastly, while 「に決まっている」 expresses
  certainty like 「ということだ」, it conveys the speaker's strong, subjective conviction, unlike 「ということだ」's focus
  on objective reporting or logical implication.

        english: I heard that according to company policy, working from home will be abolished from this
          quarter.
        hint: 「そうだ」 is a general way to convey hearsay, but 「ということだ」 implies a more definite and confirmed
          report of information.
    scene: A manager is informing their team about a new company policy that has been decided in a meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: This statement uses 「ということだ」 to report a decision based on official company policy, conveying
      a high degree of certainty and formality suitable for a professional announcement. The phrasing
      suggests the information is a confirmed fact.
    etymology: The use of 「方針」 (hōshin) refers to a definite policy or plan, reinforcing the certainty
      implied by 「ということだ」。

        hint: 「という意味だ」 explicitly defines meaning. 「ということだ」 implies it as a conclusion or implication.

    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: Here, 「ということだ」 is used to draw a conclusion or explain the implication of a situation, clarifying
      what an earlier, possibly ambiguous, statement means. 「つまり」 emphasizes that this is a summary or
      interpretation.
    etymology: 「つまり」 (tsumari) often precedes a summary or conclusion, derived from the verb 「詰まる」 (tsumaru)
      meaning 'to be詰まって (tsumatte, packed tightly)' or 'to be blocked,' implying a concise summation.
  - english: According to Sato-san, the new department head is quite a strict person.

        english: According to Sato-san, the new department head seems to be quite a strict person, you

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The male speaker uses 「佐藤 さん の 話 だ と」 to indicate the source of the information. The choice
      of 「ということだ よ」 in a casual setting suggests he is relaying a piece of information he heard and considers
      credible. The 「よ」 particle adds emphasis or conviction to his statement, which is common in male
      speech for sharing information with a certain degree of assurance.
    etymology: The phrase 「話 だ と」 (hanashi da to) implies 'according to what I heard/from their story',
      showing the information's origin. 「よ」 is a sentence-final particle used for emphasis, assertion,
      or to call attention to information.
  - english: On the TV news, it's said that that famous actress is getting married.

        english: On the TV news, I heard that that famous actress is getting married, or something.
        hint: 「とか」 implies uncertainty or vagueness, while 「ということだ」 presents information as more certain.
    scene: Two female friends are discussing celebrity gossip while watching TV.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The female speaker indicates the source with 「テレビ の ニュース で」. Her use of 「ということだ わ」 is a common
      feminine sentence-ending particle that adds a soft, informative, or slightly exclamatory nuance,
      often used when sharing new or interesting information with another woman. This example shows that
      while 「ということだ」 implies certainty, in casual female speech, it can still be used for news that is
      simply reported, even if it's celebrity gossip.
    etymology: 「わ」 is a sentence-final particle predominantly used by women, conveying a sense of conviction,
      gentle assertion, or an emotional nuance. 「女優」 (joyū) means actress, often used in conversations
      about celebrities.

      confirmed medical fact from a reliable source. It's used to relay professional advice with appropriate
      gravity and politeness.
    etymology: 「に よると」 (ni yoru to) means 'according to,' specifically citing a source for information.

          conclusion.

      for an academic setting. The phrase 「…というのは」 explicitly introduces the explanation. An older speaker
      often uses such precise and pedagogical language when imparting wisdom.
    etymology: 「急がば回れ」 (isogaba maware) is a Japanese proverb literally meaning 'if you hurry, go around
      (the long way),' implying that taking a longer, safer path is often faster than rushing and making
      mistakes. 「…というのは」 (to iu no wa) is a common pattern to introduce an explanation or definition,
      meaning 'the thing that is called...' or 'what is meant by...'.

      realization rather than a definitive statement of fact. It's common in casual conversations to confirm
      a conclusion. The phrase 「じゃあ」 (well then) sets up the conclusion.

    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: The leader uses 「とのことです」 to cite the memo as the source, then clarifies its meaning with 「つまり」
      (in other words) followed by 「ということ です」. This two-part structure (reporting and then explaining)
      shows a comprehensive understanding and communication of the directive. The polite form 「です」 is
      appropriate for a team briefing.

        english: To say 'ignorance is bliss' is that sometimes not knowing the truth is happier.
        hint: 「んです」 (no desu) is for explanation based on personal observation or emphasis, not typically
          for defining abstract meanings. We're looking for a general interpretation.
    scene: A university lecturer is explaining the nuanced meaning of a Japanese proverb to their students.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)

      such precise and pedagogical language when imparting wisdom.
  - english: So, if I don't study for the exam, it means I'll definitely fail.

        english: Well then, if I don't study for the exam, I'll definitely fail.
        hint: This alternative states a direct conditional outcome. 「ということだ」 is used to explicitly state
          the implication or meaning of the first part of the sentence.
    scene: A student is contemplating their choices the night before a big exam.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The speaker uses 「と いう こと は」 to set up the premise, then concludes with 「と いう こと だ」, expressing
      a personal, somewhat grim realization. The sentence-final particle 「な」 (uttered with a falling intonation)
      indicates a self-reflection or a confirmation to oneself, common in internal monologues or very
      casual speech. The contracted form 「って こと だ」 is also common in such situations.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「ということだ」 is used both to report information heard from
  others, often with a sense of certainty or confirmation, and to explain the meaning or implication of
  a statement or situation. The register can vary from formal (especially with official sources) to casual
  when discussing personal news or common knowledge. The choice between 「ということだ」 and similar expressions
  often hinges on the speaker's perceived certainty of the information and the desired level of formality.
