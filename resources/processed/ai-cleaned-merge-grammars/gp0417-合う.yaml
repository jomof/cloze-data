    "etymology": "The verb 「合う」 originally meant \"to fit,\" \"to match,\" or \"to suit.\" Over time, it evolved to express the idea of things or people coming together or acting in concert. The usage as a suffix to other verbs extends this concept to mean actions performed together or reciprocally.",
    "writeup": "When attached to the conjunctive form (ます stem) of another verb, 「合う」 indicates that the action is done together or mutually. It often translates to \"to mutually do (A)\" or \"to do (A) for one another,\" emphasizing that the action is reciprocal and involves both sides. Consider it as 'doing (A) as one'. This form is frequently paired with expressions like 「お互いに」 (mutually) to reinforce the shared nature of the action.\n\n「合う」 carries a nuance of actions performed 'as one', especially when it would be difficult or impossible to complete the action alone. It is often used to describe ideal situations where individuals should cooperate without focusing on personal gain.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   「合う」 can also be used in the context of sports or contests, where players' actions are interconnected and contribute to a shared outcome, even if it's competitive rather than purely cooperative.",
