    },
    "etymology": "The verb 合う (au) originally means \"to fit,\" \"to match,\" or \"to come together.\" When attached to the stem of another verb, it takes on the nuance of performing that action together or mutually. Think of it as actions aligning or 'fitting together' between two or more parties.",
    "writeup": "When 合う (au) follows the conjunctive form (連用形 ren'yōkei, or verb stem) of another verb, it indicates that the action is done in concert with another person or group. This is often translated as \"to mutually do (A),\" or \"to do (A) for one another.\" Realistically, it just means \"to do (A) reciprocally,\" with involvement from both sides being required. In this usage, 合う (au) is considered to be a suffix.\n\nThis construction is often used with expressions like お互いに (otagai ni) \"mutually,\" which simply emphasizes the point.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n*   While 合う (au) is regularly translated as \"to fit\" or \"to meet\" in English, its meaning is somewhat broader in Japanese. 合う (au) means to perform an action \"as one,\" where it is not possible (or would be difficult) to complete the action by oneself. Due to this, it is regularly used to describe ideal situations in which individuals should be doing something together, without thinking about their own personal gain.\n*   合う (au) may also be used in regard to sports/contests. In these cases, it may seem like players are not doing the action \"for\" each other, but involvement from both sides is required to make the act possible.",
