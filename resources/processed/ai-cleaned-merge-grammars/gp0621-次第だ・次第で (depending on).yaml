formation:
  '[Noun] + 次第だ': Indicates that something depends on the noun, often as a direct result or outcome.
  '[Noun] + 次第で': Indicates that something changes or is decided based on the noun, acting as a determinant
    for a subsequent action or state.
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: General
  function: To indicate that an outcome, state, or decision is contingent upon a preceding noun or situation.
  nuance: Emphasizes a direct and often unavoidable dependency, where the preceding factor is the primary
    determinant. It can imply a natural consequence or a decisive factor.
  colocation: Often follows nouns related to effort, results, conditions, and personal attributes.
  grammatical-role: Functions predicatively with だ (as 'depends on') or adverbially with で (as 'depending
    on') to modify a subsequent clause.
  logical-flow: A (determinant) → B (outcome/decision)
  temporal-flow: The determination or outcome (B) follows the existence or occurrence of the determinant
    (A).
  spatial-flow: Not applicable to this grammar point's primary function. It's a conceptual flow of dependency
    rather than physical space.
etymology: 「次第 (shidai)」 originally means "order," "sequence," or "circumstances." The grammar point retains
  the nuance that the outcome or subsequent action is determined by a preceding factor or condition. It
  indicates a direct relationship between one thing and another, where the former dictates the latter.
writeup: |-
  「次第だ」 and 「次第で」 are expressions indicating that something depends on a preceding noun. 「次第だ」 is used at the end of a sentence, while 「次第で」 connects to another clause to specify the condition upon which the subsequent action or state depends. The core nuance is that the outcome or a specific situation is **directly influenced or determined** by the preceding noun. This pattern is frequently employed to emphasize that a particular factor, often a person or a specific circumstance, holds the key to what happens next. It expresses a direct dependency, where the initial element dictates the result.

  In all its nuances, 「次第」 fundamentally expresses a sequence of events or deciding factors, and what either will or has happened due to that. This link can be seen in other grammar patterns like 「次第」 meaning "as soon as," and 「次第です」 used in the sense of "due to that" or "as a result of that."

  - term: 如何・いかん (depending on)
    meaning: How; what; (depending on) how/what; (according to) how/what; depend on
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「如何 (ikaga)」 is more formal and often used in written or very polite speech. It also implies
      a question of how something is handled or managed.
    grammar_point: 如何・いかん (depending on)
  - term: に応じて (depending on)
    meaning: Depending on, based on, according to, in response to, suitable for or to.
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「に応じて (ōjite)」 suggests adapting or conforming to something, with the nuance of flexibility
      or responsiveness. It's often used to describe actions or measures taken in response to specific
      conditions.
    grammar_point: に応じて (depending on)
  - term: 次第 (as soon as・depending on)
    meaning: As soon as; depending on
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This refers to the meaning of 「次第」 which expresses immediacy ('as soon as'). While sharing
      the same base word, its grammatical construction and core meaning are distinct from 「次第だ・次第で」, which
      indicates dependency.
    grammar_point: 次第 (as soon as・depending on)
  - term: 〜かは〜によって違う (depends on)
    meaning: Depends on, Changes depending on, Differs depending on
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「〜かは〜によって違う (~ka wa ~ ni yotte chigau)」 is a more descriptive and explicit way of saying something
      depends on something else. It emphasizes the difference that arises based on the condition.
    grammar_point: 〜かは〜によって違う (depends on)
  - term: にかかっている (to depend on)
    meaning: To depend on
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「にかかっている (ni kakatteiru)」 focuses on responsibility or agency, indicating that the outcome
      rests on someone or something. There's a sense of "hinging on" or "being up to."
    grammar_point: にかかっている (to depend on)
  - term: によって (means・cause・dependency)
    meaning: By means of, according to, depending on, because of, due to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「によって」 is a broad term for cause, means, or dependency, 「次第だ・次第で」 specifically highlights
      a direct and often inherent determination or consequence. 「によって」 can simply indicate a variation,
      while 「次第だ・次第で」 often implies the primary deciding factor.
    grammar_point: によって・による・により (means・cause・dependency)
  - term: 次第です (circumstances leading to)
    meaning: This is why; The circumstances are such that; Therefore (a situation arises)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both use 「次第」 but serve different functions. 「次第だ・次第で」 states a direct dependency for an outcome.
      In contrast, 「次第です (circumstances leading to)」 is typically used in formal contexts to explain the
      background or reason for a current situation, often equivalent to "This is why it is so."
    grammar_point: 次第です (circumstances leading to)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share the idea of dependency, 「次第だ」 and 「次第で」 emphasize
  a direct relationship between a factor and its outcome, often implying it's the primary or sole determinant,
  without necessarily implying adaptation, responsibility, or being a general causal link. Choosing the
  right expression depends on the specific nuance you want to convey. For a more general cause or means,
  「によって」 is often used. If you want to express adapting to a certain situation, 「に応じて」 will be more appropriate.
  If you want to place the responsibility on something, then 「にかかっている」 will be more appropriate. If you
  are explaining the background or reason for a situation, the formal 「次第です」 might be used. But if you
  just want to simply express that something depends directly on something else, then 「次第だ」 and 「次第で」
  will be the most appropriate.

      it as a natural outcome.

          looking for a simple, direct statement of dependency.
    scene: Two colleagues discussing an upcoming outdoor event.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: In a casual professional discussion, 「次第です」 states a direct contingency in a polite manner,
      making it clear that the weather is the direct determinant.

    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The instructor emphasizes a direct cause-and-effect in cooking. 「次第で」 expresses this immediate
      determining factor strongly, showing that the taste is a direct result of ingredient quality.
    etymology: Not applicable to this specific example, but the core meaning of 「次第」 as "order" or "sequence"
      implies a natural progression or determination by a preceding factor, which is ingredient quality
      here.

    scene: An older mentor encouraging a young apprentice to work hard.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: inspirational
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「いくらでも変わるだろう」 suggests limitless possibilities, a common motivational phrase. The
      context of an 'older mentor' emphasizes wisdom being passed down. 「次第で」 conveys the direct, determining
      influence of effort on the future.

      implies a natural progression or determination by a preceding factor, which is effort here.

    scene: A coach explaining the true source of a player's achievement.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: The coach is making a strong counter-assertion about the primary determinant. 「次第ではない」 directly
      negates the commonly assumed dependency on talent, making an impactful statement about other factors
      being more important.
    etymology: Not applicable to this specific example, but the core meaning of 「次第」 as "order" or "sequence"
      or "circumstances" is negated here to state that talent is not the determining circumstance.

          We're looking for a statement about a direct, decisive dependency in the past.
    scene: A team manager retrospectively explaining a past financial decision.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: When discussing a past decision, 「次第だった」 emphasizes that the budget was *contingent* on his
      approval, conveying the inherent dependency more than a simple factual statement of it being 'decided
      by' him.
    etymology: Not applicable to this specific example, but the core meaning of 「次第」 as "order" or "sequence"
      or "circumstances" highlights that the budget's circumstance was determined by the approval.

    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「ぜ」 (ze) is a colloquial male sentence-final particle expressing emphasis or assertion.
      「夜飯」 (yorumeshi) is a casual term for dinner. This combination creates a very casual, masculine
      tone, emphasizing that the decision rests entirely with the listener's appetite.

    setting: intimate

    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The sentence-final particle 「わ」 (wa) is typically used by female speakers to express a soft
      assertion or personal sentiment, fitting an intimate conversation. 「二人の気持ち」 (futari no kimochi)
      highlights the mutual aspect of their feelings influencing the future.
    etymology: Not applicable.

      It more clearly denotes that the usage is the *determining factor* for the evaluation.

      implies a natural progression or determination by a preceding factor, which is the usage here.

        english: Whether we can win the game or not hinges on our teamwork.
        hint: 「にかかっている」 implies that the outcome is reliant on or 'hinges' on their teamwork, often with

          is the decisive factor.
    scene: A sports coach is giving a motivational speech to their team before a big match.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: inspirational
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The coach is asserting that the outcome of the game is directly and entirely determined by
      the quality of their teamwork. The use of 「次第だ」 in this context underscores that teamwork is the
      **decisive factor**, leaving no room for other excuses. This is a common phrase to rally a group
      around a single, critical element for success.
    etymology: Not applicable.
post_example_writeup: Note that 「次第では」 is a slight variation of 「次第で」. It has a nuance that is hypothetical,
  as in "depending on the circumstances." It suggests that the speaker is considering a possible outcome
  based on the conditions.
