formation:
  '[Previous Clause/Sentence] + それで + [Result/Consequence]': Indicates that the preceding clause is the
    reason or cause for the following clause.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to connect two sentences, showing a causal relationship or indicating a continuation
    of a story.
  function: Connects clauses to express cause, reason, or logical sequence.
  nuance: Less formal than そのため. Can be used conversationally to prompt for continuation ("and then?").
  grammatical-role: Conjunction
  logical-flow: Cause-and-effect or sequential implication.
  temporal-flow: Implies a logical progression in time.
etymology: それで is derived from the pronoun それ (that) and the particle で, which indicates means or cause.
  Therefore, literally, it means "with that" or "by that means," referring back to the previous clause
  or sentence.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「それで」 functions as a conjunction connecting two clauses or sentences. It is essentially a combination of the pronoun 「それ」, which refers to the entirety of the preceding statement or situation, and the particle 「で」, which indicates the means or cause. This construction conveys that the preceding information is the reason, cause, or basis for the following statement. As such, it can be translated as "because of that," "therefore," "so," or "with that."

  「それで」 is often used to show a direct consequence or logical result of a previous action or situation. It is commonly found at the beginning of a second sentence to clearly link it to the first. While it expresses causality, it is generally less formal than expressions like 「そのため」 or 「それゆえ」.

  In conversational contexts, 「それで？」 can be used interrogatively to prompt the speaker for the next part of a story, akin to "And then?" or "So what happened?" This usage is very common and natural in Japanese conversation.
false_friends:
  - term: そのため(に)
    meaning: For that reason, because of that, to that end
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike それで, そのため(に) often implies a more specific and intentional purpose or a formal, clear
      consequence. It emphasizes the 'reason' aspect more strongly and is generally more formal.
    grammar_point: そのため (for that reason)
  - term: だから
    meaning: Therefore, so, that's why
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: だから is generally more assertive and direct in stating a reason or conclusion. It can sound
      more confrontational or emphasize the speaker's judgment, whereas それで is more neutral and simply
      presents the consequence or next logical step.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:だから (therefore, so)
  - term: 〜ので
    meaning: Because, so (polite reason)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜ので typically connects a reason clause directly to a main clause within a single sentence,
      often implying a softer or more polite reason. それで, on the other hand, usually acts as a conjunction
      between two distinct sentences, presenting the second sentence as a direct consequence or continuation
      of the first.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]〜から (because・so)'
  - term: それでは
    meaning: Well then, in that case, if so (formal)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「それでは」 is a formal transitional phrase used to indicate a shift in topic, a conclusion to
      a discussion, or a move to the next action based on the current situation. It does not express a
      direct cause-and-effect relationship in the same way それで does. It is also the formal form of 「それじゃ」.
    grammar_point: それでは (well then)
  - term: それじゃ
    meaning: Well then, in that case, if so (casual)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「それじゃ」 is the casual contraction of 「それでは」. It functions similarly as a transitional phrase,
      signaling a shift or next step, rather than a direct cause-and-effect. It is informal and more commonly
      used in casual conversations than the formal 「それでは」.
    grammar_point: それでは (well then)
  - term: それでいて
    meaning: And yet, nevertheless, despite that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「それでいて」 expresses a contradictory or unexpected outcome despite what was previously stated,
      implying a sense of 'and yet' or 'nevertheless.' In contrast, 「それで」 indicates a direct, logical
      consequence or continuation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:それでいて (and yet, nevertheless, despite that)
  - term: そして
    meaning: And, and then (sequential)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そして」 primarily indicates a chronological sequence of events without necessarily implying
      a causal link. 「それで」, while also sequential, places a stronger emphasis on the preceding event being
      the cause or reason for the following one.
    grammar_point: そして (and・and then)
  - term: すると
    meaning: And then, as a result (often surprising)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「すると」 often implies an immediate and sometimes unexpected consequence, or a sudden change.
      While it shows a result, it can carry a nuance of surprise or discovery, whereas 「それで」 typically
      presents a more straightforward, expected cause-and-effect.
    grammar_point: すると (and then・as a result)
post_false_friends_writeup: While それで and そのため(に) both convey causality, そのため(に) often indicates a more
  deliberate purpose or a more formal causal link. だから is a stronger, more direct way to express 'that's
  why,' which can sometimes sound abrupt or assertive. When connecting a reason to a result within a single
  sentence, 〜ので is a common choice, offering a softer tone. Lastly, それでは and それじゃ function primarily as
  transitional phrases, signaling a shift or a next step, rather than directly stating a cause or reason.
  「それでいて」 introduces a contradiction, indicating an 'and yet' relationship, which is different from the
  direct consequence expressed by 「それで」. 「そして」 simply connects events in sequence, while 「すると」 suggests
  an immediate, often surprising, result. Choosing between them depends on the nuance of causality, formality,
  and whether you are linking sentences or transitioning conversationally.
