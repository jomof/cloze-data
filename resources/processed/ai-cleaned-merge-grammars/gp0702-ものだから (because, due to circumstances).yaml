    "writeup": "「ものだから」 is used to provide a strong reason or explanation for something, often as an excuse. It's similar to 「から」 (because), but 「もの」 emphasizes the reason more strongly. You can think of 「ものだから」 as conveying \"the reason is...\" or \"because (of the situation).\" It directly follows verbs and い-adjectives in their plain forms. For な-adjectives and nouns, you attach them in their plain forms (e.g., 静かなものだから, 学生なものだから, or 静かだったものだから, 学生だったものだから). Sometimes it's shortened to 「もので」 or 「もんで」, without changing the core meaning. These shortened forms are common in more casual conversation. This grammar point is often used when explaining one's actions, emphasizing that a specific situation led to a particular action.",
