    },
    "etymology": "The word 「結果 (kekka)」 is formed from two kanji: 「結 (ketsu)」 meaning \"to bind\" or \"to tie,\" and 「果 (ka)」 meaning \"fruit\" or \"result.\" Together, they create the sense of something being tied together as a consequence or outcome.",
    "writeup": "「結果 (kekka)」 is a noun that signifies \"result,\" \"consequence,\" or \"outcome.\" It is fundamentally used to express a cause-and-effect relationship, highlighting that the preceding action or situation directly led to what follows. This grammar point maintains a neutral stance, simply stating the factual outcome without implying positive or negative connotations, unlike other expressions such as 「おかげで」 or 「せいで」.\n\nIt commonly appears in two primary formations:\n*   **[Noun] + の + 結果:** This structure links the result directly to a preceding noun, as in 「試験 の 結果」 (as a result of the exam).\n*   **[Verb (past informal)] + 結果:** This structure connects the result to a preceding action, for example, 「話し合った 結果」 (as a result of having discussed).\n\n「結果」 is a versatile expression encountered across various communication registers, from formal academic papers and news reports to casual everyday conversations. Its objective nature makes it suitable for reporting findings, explaining consequences, or summarizing outcomes in a clear and concise manner.",
