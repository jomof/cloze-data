        "part-of-speech": "auxiliary verb",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Commonly used in notices, signs, and official documents; typically not used in casual conversation. Primarily found in written language or highly formal spoken contexts such as announcements.",
        "function": "Functions to issue commands or requirements, applicable for both affirmative and negative instructions.",
        "nuance": "Conveys an impersonal and authoritative tone, making statements sound like established rules or regulations rather than personal requests."
    },
    "etymology": "「こと」 is a noun meaning \"thing\" or \"matter.\" In this grammatical construction, it functions as a formal way to express a requirement or command. It lends a sense of impersonal authority to the statement, transforming a statement into a directive or rule.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「こと」, when employed in the imperative form, serves to issue commands, instructions, or requirements. This usage is almost exclusively found in formal and written contexts, such as public notices, signs, official documents, or school regulations. It is emphatically *not* used in everyday conversation; its inclusion would render speech highly unnatural and stiff. You will frequently encounter it in public spaces, schools, or workplaces where rules or guidelines need to be clearly and impersonally stated. Consider it a means of conveying a directive in a polite yet firm manner, particularly suitable for environments where direct, personal commands might be perceived as too harsh or informal. This form can be applied to both affirmative instructions (e.g., \"do this\") and negative prohibitions (e.g., \"do not do that\"). Its strength lies in its ability to present rules and requirements with a detached, objective authority, making it an ideal choice for formal directives.",

            "nuance": "「〜なさい」 is also used to give commands, but it is typically used by superiors to inferiors (e.g., parents to children, teachers to students) and carries a more direct, personal tone. 「こと」 does not imply that hierarchical relationship; it functions as an impersonal directive."

            "nuance": "While 「〜てください」 is a polite request, 「こと (imperative)」 functions as a formal, impersonal command or instruction. The latter is used for rules or requirements, not mere polite suggestions."

            "term": "〜するな",
            "meaning": "Do not do (strong prohibition)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「〜するな」 is a very strong, direct, and often harsh prohibition. In contrast, 「〜ないこと」 provides a more formal and objective way to state a negative rule or prohibition, often used in written notices to maintain a more authoritative yet less confrontational tone."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「こと」, 「〜なさい」, 「〜てください」, and 「〜するな」 can all be used to convey directives, their formality, nuance, and appropriate contexts differ significantly. 「こと」 is uniquely suited for formal, impersonal rules and instructions, especially in written form, such as official notices or public signs. 「〜なさい」 carries a direct, personal tone used by those in authority towards subordinates. 「〜てください」 is a polite request, softer and more personal. 「〜するな」 is a blunt and forceful prohibition, often used in informal or urgent contexts. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for appropriate usage.",
