        "part-of-speech": "auxiliary verb",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Commonly used in notices, signs, and official documents; typically not used in casual conversation. Primarily found in written language or highly formal spoken contexts such as announcements.",
        "function": "Functions to issue commands or requirements, applicable for both affirmative and negative instructions.",
        "nuance": "Conveys an impersonal and authoritative tone, making statements sound like established rules or regulations rather than personal requests."
    },
    "etymology": "「こと」 is a noun meaning \"thing\" or \"matter.\" In this grammatical construction, it functions as a formal way to express a requirement or command. It lends a sense of impersonal authority to the statement, transforming a statement into a directive or rule.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「こと」, when employed in the imperative form, serves to issue commands, instructions, or requirements. This usage is almost exclusively found in formal and written contexts, such as public notices, signs, official documents, or school regulations. It is emphatically *not* used in everyday conversation; its inclusion would render speech highly unnatural and stiff. You will frequently encounter it in public spaces, schools, or workplaces where rules or guidelines need to be clearly and impersonally stated. Consider it a means of conveying a directive in a polite yet firm manner, particularly suitable for environments where direct, personal commands might be perceived as too harsh or informal. This form can be applied to both affirmative instructions (e.g., \"do this\") and negative prohibitions (e.g., \"do not do that\"). Its strength lies in its ability to present rules and requirements with a detached, objective authority, making it an ideal choice for formal directives.",
