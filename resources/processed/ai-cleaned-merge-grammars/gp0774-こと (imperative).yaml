    "etymology": "「こと」is a noun meaning \"thing\" or \"matter.\" In this grammatical construction, it functions as a formal way to express a requirement or command. It lends a sense of impersonal authority to the statement.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「こと」, when used in the imperative form, serves to issue commands, instructions, or requirements. This usage is almost exclusively found in formal writing, such as notices, signs, or official documentation. It is not typically used in everyday conversation. You'll often see it in public spaces, schools, or companies to state rules or guidelines. Think of it as a way to issue a direction in a polite but firm manner, suitable for environments where direct commands might seem too harsh. It can be used in both positive and negative forms.",
