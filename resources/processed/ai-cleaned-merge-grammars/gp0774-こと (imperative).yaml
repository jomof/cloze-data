    "writeup": "The grammar point 「こと」, when used in the imperative form, serves to issue commands, instructions, or requirements. This usage is almost exclusively found in formal writing, such as notices, signs, or official documentation. It is not typically used in everyday conversation. You'll often see it in public spaces, schools, or companies to state rules or guidelines. Think of it as a way to issue a direction in a polite but firm manner, suitable for environments where direct commands might seem too harsh. It can be used in both positive and negative forms.",

The male speaker uses this otherwise rigid phrasing to emphasize the absolute and exclusive nature of the \"secret\" between them, making it feel special and conspiratorial. The 「ね」 softens the formality, making it more of a shared understanding. This unusual application highlights the strict formality of 「こと」 by contrasting it with an informal context.",

            "nuance": "A young female speaker uses the formal 「こと」 in a highly unconventional, playful manner to express her strong desire for the man to remember their enjoyable first date. It's a whimsical, yet firm, 'command' given affectionately. The added 「ね」 softens the imperative, making it sound more like a shared understanding or a plea, rather than a strict directive. This informal application with a formal grammar point highlights its usual rigidity.",
            "etymology": "「忘れずにいること」 combines 忘れずに (without forgetting) with the imperative こと, implying an instruction to keep the memory."
