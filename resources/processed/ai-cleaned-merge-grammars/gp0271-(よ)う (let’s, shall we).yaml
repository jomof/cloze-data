  or definitive point.
writeup: |-
  The adverb 「いよいよ」 is a versatile expression in Japanese that conveys a sense of culmination, intensification, or the arrival of a significant moment. It has two primary meanings:

  1.  **Finally; At last; At the very last moment**: This usage indicates that a long-awaited event or a critical stage has finally arrived, often carrying a sense of anticipation, excitement, or tension. It's used when something reaches its climax or is on the verge of starting.

      *   Example: 「いよいよ試験の日だ。」 (Finally, it's the day of the exam.)

  2.  **More and more; Increasingly; All the more**: In this sense, 「いよいよ」 emphasizes a continuous increase or intensification of a state, condition, or feeling. It highlights a progression towards a higher degree.

      *   Example: 「いよいよ寒くなってきた。」 (It's getting colder and colder.)

  **Nuance and Usage:**

  *   **Anticipation and Climax**: When used to mean 'finally' or 'at last', 「いよいよ」 often implies that the preceding events have led up to this crucial point. There's a sense of something important being about to happen, or having just happened.
  *   **Intensification**: When meaning 'more and more', it suggests a progressive change that is becoming more pronounced. This can apply to physical states (e.g., weather, health) or abstract qualities.
  *   **Formal vs. Casual**: While 「いよいよ」 is commonly used in both spoken and written Japanese, it tends to lean towards a slightly more formal or emphatic tone compared to simpler adverbs like 「だんだん」 or 「もっと」. It carries a certain gravity or emphasis.
  *   **Positive and Negative Contexts**: Unlike some adverbs that are restricted to positive or negative outcomes, 「いよいよ」 can be used in both. For example, a long-awaited vacation (positive) or a worsening situation (negative).

  **Comparison with Similar Expressions:**

  「いよいよ」 shares some semantic overlap with other adverbs, but its unique nuance of anticipation or reaching a critical point sets it apart.

  *   **とうとう (tōtō)**: Also means 'finally' or 'at last', but often implies that something happened after a long time, often with a sense of relief or resignation, or a slightly negative nuance if a bad outcome was inevitable.
  *   **ついに (tsuini)**: Similar to 'finally', but tends to be more objective, indicating that something happened as a result of a long process, often with a sense of achievement or inevitability, regardless of positive or negative.
  *   **だんだん (dandan)**: Means 'gradually' or 'little by little', focusing on a slow, steady progression without necessarily implying a climactic point.
  *   **ますます (masumasu)**: Means 'more and more' or 'increasingly', similar to 「いよいよ」 in its intensification meaning, but lacks the sense of culmination or arriving at a critical point.

  Understanding these subtle differences will help you choose the most appropriate word to convey the precise nuance.

    meaning: Gradually, little by little, step by step
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both indicate a progressive change, 「だんだん」 focuses on a **slow and steady progression**
      without implying a critical point or culmination, whereas 「いよいよ」 often suggests an **intensification

    kind: similar expression

      degree, while 「いよいよ」 can also highlight the **arrival of a final or critical stage** of that increase.
    grammar_point: ますます (more and more)
  - term: とうとう (finally・eventually)
    meaning: Finally, after all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とうとう」 means 'finally' or 'at last', but often implies something happened **after a long struggle
      or delay**, sometimes with a sense of relief, resignation, or negative inevitability. 「いよいよ」, while
      also meaning 'finally', carries more of a sense of **anticipation or a critical point being reached**,
      irrespective of the outcome's positivity or negativity.

      of a long process or an inevitable outcome**, often with a sense of accomplishment or strong resolution.
      「いよいよ」 retains a stronger sense of **anticipation or the reaching of a climactic point**.
    grammar_point: 遂に (finally・at last)
post_false_friends_writeup: The core difference between 「いよいよ」 and other adverbs like 「だんだん」 and 「ますます」
  lies in its nuanced implication of a culmination or critical moment. While the latter two focus purely
  on a gradual or continuous increase, 「いよいよ」 suggests that this increase is leading to or has reached
  an important stage. When compared to 「とうとう」 and 「ついに」, all three can mean 'finally', but 「いよいよ」 specifically
  emphasizes the sense of **anticipation and the impending or actual arrival of a climactic event**, whereas
  「とうとう」 can imply relief or resignation after a long wait, and 「ついに」 suggests an inevitable outcome or
  achievement after a process. Paying attention to this 'sense of climax' will help you distinguish 「いよいよ」
  from its similar counterparts.

    scene: After months of planning and anticipation, a local community is thrilled that their annual
      festival is about to begin.

      building up for the festival. It conveys that the 'long-awaited' day has finally come, marking a
      significant and climactic moment.
    etymology: 「祭り の 日」 refers to 'the day of the festival'. 「来た」 is the past tense of 「来る」 (kuru), 'to
      come'. The phrase captures the excitement of a long-anticipated event finally arriving.

      a stronger sense of culmination to the increasing cold.
    etymology: 「寒く なって き た」 describes the process of becoming cold. 「寒く」 is the adverbial form of the
      i-adjective 「寒い」 (samui), 'cold'. 「なって きた」 is the te-form of 「なる」 (naru), 'to become', combined
      with 「くる」 (kuru), 'to come', indicating a change that has been progressing up to the present.

      to an audience. It signals the imminent start of something highly anticipated.

    etymology: 「本題」 (hondai) means 'the main subject' or 'the heart of the matter'. 「入って き た」 is formed

      process that has led to the current state of entering the main topic.
