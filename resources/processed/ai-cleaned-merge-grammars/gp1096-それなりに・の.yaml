    },
    "etymology": "The term 「それなり」 is derived from 「それ」 (that) and 「なり」 (being, state). The 「に」 particle turns it into an adverb, while 「の」 makes it an adjectival phrase. Thus, 「それなりに」 suggests something is in 'that state' or 'as it is' appropriately or suitably.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「それなりに」 (sore nari ni) and 「それなりの」 (sore nari no) express that something is done, experienced, or exists in a way that is appropriate, proportionate, or expected. It carries a nuance of 'in its own way' or 'suitably'.\n\n*   **それなりに (sore nari ni):** Used as an adverb, it modifies verbs and adjectives, indicating the manner in which something is done or exists. For instance, 「それなりに頑張る」 means \"to do one's best in one's own way\" or \"to try reasonably hard.\"\n*   **それなりの (sore nari no):** Used as an adjectival phrase, it modifies nouns, indicating a quality or characteristic that is appropriate or proportionate. For example, 「それなりの理由」 means \"a corresponding reason\" or \"a reasonable reason.\"\n\nIt implies an understanding that things are as they should be, given the circumstances, often acknowledging a certain level of satisfaction or adequacy despite potential limitations or challenges. It can be used in both formal and casual settings, making it quite versatile.",

            "meaning": "in one's own way; for oneself",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「それなりに」 implies a degree of appropriateness or expectation, 「なりに」 focuses on doing something within one's own capabilities or circumstances. 「なりに」 emphasizes personal effort or approach rather than inherent suitability."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference between 「それなりに」 and 「なりに」 is that 「それなりに」 suggests something is adequate or appropriate for the given situation, while 「なりに」 implies making the best of one's own abilities or resources. For example, 「私なりに頑張ります」 (watashi nari ni ganbarimasu) means \"I will do my best in my own way\", focusing on personal effort. In contrast, 「それなりに美味しいです」(sore nari ni oishii desu) means \"It's tasty in its own way (to a certain extent),\" implying that it's acceptably tasty but perhaps not exceptional.",

    "post_example_writeup": "The examples illustrate the flexibility of 「それなりに・の」. 「それなりに」 functions adverbially, modifying verbs or adjectives to describe an action or state as being 'in its own way' or 'suitably.' For instance, 「それなりに楽しめる」 suggests enjoying something within its given circumstances. In contrast, 「それなりの」 acts as an adjectival phrase, modifying a noun to indicate a quality or characteristic that is 'proportionate' or 'appropriate' to something else, as seen in 「それなりの理由」 or 「それなりの値段」. Understanding this distinction is key to accurate usage."
