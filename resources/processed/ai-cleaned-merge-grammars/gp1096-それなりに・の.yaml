    },
    "etymology": "The term 「それなり」 is derived from 「それ」 (that) and 「なり」 (being, state). The 「に」 particle turns it into an adverb, while 「の」 makes it an adjectival phrase. Thus, 「それなりに」 suggests something is in 'that state' or 'as it is' appropriately or suitably.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「それなりに」 (sore nari ni) and 「それなりの」 (sore nari no) express that something is done, experienced, or exists in a way that is appropriate, proportionate, or expected. It carries a nuance of 'in its own way' or 'suitably'.\n\n*   **それなりに (sore nari ni):** Used as an adverb, it modifies verbs and adjectives, indicating the manner in which something is done or exists. For instance, 「それなりに頑張る」 means \"to do one's best in one's own way\" or \"to try reasonably hard.\"\n*   **それなりの (sore nari no):** Used as an adjectival phrase, it modifies nouns, indicating a quality or characteristic that is appropriate or proportionate. For example, 「それなりの理由」 means \"a corresponding reason\" or \"a reasonable reason.\"\n\nIt implies an understanding that things are as they should be, given the circumstances, often acknowledging a certain level of satisfaction or adequacy despite potential limitations or challenges. It can be used in both formal and casual settings, making it quite versatile.",
