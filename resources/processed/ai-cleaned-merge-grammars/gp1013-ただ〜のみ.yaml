    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Literary, stiff, or formal contexts, often implying a lack of other options.",
        "function": "Emphasizes exclusivity or limitation of action or state.",
        "nuance": "Highlights inevitability, the singular focus, or the lack of other viable options."
    },
    "etymology": "「ただ」 means \"merely\" or \"simply\". 「のみ」 is an adverbial particle meaning \"just\" or \"only,\" similar to 「だけ」 or 「ばかり」, but more formal. The combination emphasizes the exclusivity or limitation of an action or state.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「ただ〜のみ」 is typically interpreted as \"(A) is all that is required\" or \"(A) is all that remains.\" It combines 「ただ」 (\"merely\") with the adverbial particle 「のみ」 (\"just\" or \"only\"). 「のみ」 itself has similar meanings and uses as 「だけ」 and 「ばかり」, but is slightly more formal.Frequently, (A) will be a verb that indicates movement, continuation, or hope, highlighting that one has already done everything possible, and all that is left is to hope for a good result, or that one is already doing all that is necessary, and all that remains is to continue.When 「する」 verbs are used with this expression, they are occasionally replaced by 「ある」. This puts more focus on the existence of the action, rather than the action itself; the replacement of 「する」 with 「ある」 is primarily literary.",

            "term": "だけ",
            "meaning": "only, just",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「だけ」 is more common and less formal. It simply indicates a limit or exclusion, whereas 「のみ」 often carries a nuance of finality, inevitability, or a strong emphasis on the singular option remaining."
        },
        {
            "term": "ばかり",
            "meaning": "only, just (implies abundance or exclusivity)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ばかり」 can indicate \"only\" or \"nothing but,\" often with a sense of \"always doing\" or \"full of.\" While it shares exclusivity with 「のみ」, 「ばかり」 can also imply \"about\" or \"just finished doing,\" and generally doesn't carry the same formal or decisive tone as 「のみ」."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「だけ」 and 「ばかり」 can also mean 'only' or 'just,' 「ただ〜のみ」 carries a stronger, more formal, and often more decisive nuance. It emphasizes that the stated action or state is the *sole* remaining possibility, often implying a sense of inevitability or the exhaustion of all other options. Use 「ただ〜のみ」 when you want to convey a profound sense of limitation, finality, or singular determination in a formal context.",

            "conjugation": "dictionary (plain non-past)",
            "nuance": "The use of 「のみ」 here emphasizes the gravity of the situation and the fact that waiting is the *only* remaining action, conveying a sense of inevitability. The choice of plain form 「だ」 is suitable for a serious internal thought or a statement among people facing a shared, dire circumstance, while 「です」 and 「である」 offer increasing levels of formality.",
            "etymology": "The phrase is derived from 「ただ」 ('merely') and 「のみ」 ('only'), both emphasizing singularity. In this context, it highlights the absolute nature of having only one option left."

The polite ending 「です」 conveys a sense of heartfelt resignation or a shared empathetic tone with the listener. The plain form 「だ」 is more direct, while 「である」 adds a highly formal or literary tone."
