    "etymology": "「ただ」 means \"merely\" or \"simply\". 「のみ」 is an adverbial particle meaning \"just\" or \"only,\" similar to 「だけ」 or 「ばかり」, but more formal. The combination emphasizes the exclusivity or limitation of an action or state.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「ただ〜のみ」 is typically interpreted as \"(A) is all that is required\" or \"(A) is all that remains.\" It combines 「ただ」 (\"merely\") with the adverbial particle 「のみ」 (\"just\" or \"only\"). 「のみ」 itself has similar meanings and uses as 「だけ」 and 「ばかり」, but is slightly more formal.\n\nFrequently, (A) will be a verb that indicates movement, continuation, or hope, highlighting that one has already done everything possible, and all that is left is to hope for a good result, or that one is already doing all that is necessary, and all that remains is to continue.\n\nWhen 「する」 verbs are used with this expression, they are occasionally replaced by 「ある」. This puts more focus on the existence of the action, rather than the action itself; the replacement of 「する」 with 「ある」 is primarily literary.",
