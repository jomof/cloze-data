    "etymology": "「途中(とちゅう)」 literally means 'on the way' or 'midway'. The addition of 「に」 or 「で」 specifies the context: 「に」 emphasizes the location or time *on the way*, while 「で」 emphasizes the action or process happening *in the middle of* something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「途中に・途中で」 employs the noun 「途中」(tochuu), meaning 'on the way' or 'midway'. This construction indicates an action or event occurring while something else is in progress. The choice between the particles 「に」 and 「で」 introduces a subtle yet crucial distinction in nuance.\n\nGenerally, 「途中」 can attach to the dictionary form of a verb or to a noun followed by 「の」.\n\n*   When paired with 「に」, the focus is often on the **point in time** or **location** during the duration of the action or event. It signifies that something occurs *at a certain stage* on the way or in the middle of something, often when the activity is considered a mere temporal or spatial backdrop.\n*   Conversely, 「で」 emphasizes the **process** or **action** itself as the context for something else to happen. It often implies that the preceding action provides the **opportunity** or **cause** for the subsequent event, or that the event is a natural consequence of being in that ongoing process.\n\nWhile there is indeed overlap in their usage, and both can often be used interchangeably without creating semantic ambiguity, understanding these subtle differences enhances one's grasp of natural Japanese. Immersion through extensive example exposure is key to discerning their most appropriate application.",
