    "etymology": "「みせる」 (miseru) as an auxiliary verb traces its origin to the verb 「見る」 (miru, to see) or 「見せる」 (miseru, to show). When appended in the 「て」 (te) form, it signifies the speaker's resolve to perform an action to such an extent that the result becomes apparent to others. This emphasizes the speaker's determination and confidence, akin to saying \"I will do it and *show* you the outcome,\" thereby implying a strong promise or boast.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[て]+みせる」 expresses the speaker's strong determination to do something, often with the intention of demonstrating the result to others. It carries a nuance of confidence and resolve, suggesting that the speaker wants to prove something or fulfill a promise.\n\nTo form it, simply conjugate the verb into its て-form and then add 「みせる」. The level of emphasis can vary based on context; it can range from a simple declaration of intent to a strong, almost boastful, promise.\n\nThis pattern inherently implies an audience, whether directly present or implicitly addressed. If the person being shown is not explicitly stated, it often implies a general audience, such as \"I'll show everyone.\" It is not merely a strong statement of intent, but rather a commitment to achieve something in a way that its success will be evident to others. This emphasis on 'showing' distinguishes it from simpler declarations of intent.",

                    "competing_grammar": "お前のために、次の試合では勝つ！",
                    "mitigation": "This alternative expresses a strong intent but lacks the emphasis on 'showing' the result to an audience, which 「てみせる」 conveys. The scene implies a personal commitment to someone who will witness the outcome."

            "nuance": "「お前」 (omae) is a very informal term for 'you', often used by males towards someone they are close to, or sometimes used in a condescending manner. In this context, given the 'inspirational' setting and implied close relationship, it signifies intimacy. The speaker's gender is typically male due to the use of 「お前」 in this familiar and determined context."
