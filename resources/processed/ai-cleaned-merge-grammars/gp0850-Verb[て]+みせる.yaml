    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[て]+みせる」 expresses the speaker's strong determination to do something, often with the intention of showing the result to someone else. It carries a nuance of confidence and resolve.\n\nTo form it, simply conjugate the verb into its て-form and then add 「みせる」. The level of emphasis can vary based on context. It can range from a simple declaration of intent to a strong promise.\n\nThis pattern requires a target, either direct or implied. If the person being shown is not explicit, it implies \"I'll show everyone.\"",
