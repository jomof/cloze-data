    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "auxiliary verb",
        "usage-context": "General usage",
        "function": "Used to express the speaker's strong determination to do something, often with the intention of demonstrating the result to others.",
        "nuance": "Implies a demonstration of skill, resolve, or the fulfillment of a promise to an audience, whether directly present or implicitly addressed. It goes beyond a mere statement of intent.",
        "colocation": "Often follows verbs indicating effort, achievement, or action, such as やり遂げる (to accomplish), 合格する (to pass), 応える (to meet expectations), 成功させる (to make successful), 走る (to run), 作る (to make), 乗り越える (to overcome).",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as an auxiliary verb, attaching to the te-form of a preceding verb to add nuance of demonstrative determination."
    },
    "etymology": "「みせる」 (miseru) as an auxiliary verb traces its origin to the verb 「見る」 (miru, to see) or 「見せる」 (miseru, to show). When appended in the 「て」 (te) form, it signifies the speaker's resolve to perform an action to such an extent that the result becomes apparent to others. This emphasizes the speaker's determination and confidence, akin to saying \"I will do it and *show* you the outcome,\" thereby implying a strong promise or boast.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[て]+みせる」 expresses the speaker's strong determination to do something, often with the intention of demonstrating the result to others. It carries a nuance of confidence and resolve, suggesting that the speaker wants to prove something or fulfill a promise.\n\nTo form it, simply conjugate the verb into its て-form and then add 「みせる」. The level of emphasis can vary based on context; it can range from a simple declaration of intent to a strong, almost boastful, promise.\n\nThis pattern inherently implies an audience, whether directly present or implicitly addressed. If the person being shown is not explicitly stated, it often implies a general audience, such as \"I'll show everyone.\" It is not merely a strong statement of intent, but rather a commitment to achieve something in a way that its success will be evident to others. This emphasis on 'showing' distinguishes it from simpler declarations of intent.",
