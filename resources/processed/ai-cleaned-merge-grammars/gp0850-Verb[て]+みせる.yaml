    "etymology": "「見(み)せる」is derived from the verb 「見る(みる)」(to see) combined with 「せる」, the causative auxiliary verb. The て-form connects the action (Verb[て]) to the act of 'showing', implying that the speaker is determined to perform the action in a way that others can witness or acknowledge it.",
    "writeup": "「てみせる」, often written in hiragana, is an emphatic structure indicating the speaker will do something (A) in a way that's clear to the listener. It translates as \"I will definitely (A)\" or \"I swear I will (A),\" but literally means \"I will show you that I'll do (A).\" To use 「てみせる」, change the preceding verb to its te-form.\n\nBecause 「みせる」 requires a target for the showing, this grammar pattern is used when someone will directly be shown (A), or when the speaker talks about showing someone (A) not present physically or temporally. It isn't used when simply strongly stating intent, unless who sees (A) is important. Without a clear target, it implies \"I'll show everyone.\"\n\nSince 「て見せる」 simply means to \"show (A),\" it's often used without special emphasis. Context usually clarifies whether it's emphatic.",
