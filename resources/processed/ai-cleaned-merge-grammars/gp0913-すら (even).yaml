    "etymology": "The particle 「すら」 is believed to have originated from the verb 「する」 (suru, to do). Over time, it evolved to signify 'even' by highlighting an action or state's extreme reach, implying that if something is true for the most unlikely case, it is certainly true for less extreme ones. This transformation from a verb root to an emphasizing particle reflects a common linguistic process where elements signifying 'doing' or 'achieving' come to denote 'extensiveness' or 'inclusion,' akin to how 'even' functions in English.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「すら」 is an adverbial particle in Japanese that translates as \"even.\" Its primary function is to highlight an extreme case, implying that if something applies to this most unlikely or difficult scenario, it necessarily applies to all less extreme ones. This often carries a negative or surprising nuance.\n\n「すら」 can be placed directly after nouns or after nouns followed by case-marking particles (e.g., に、で). For added emphasis, 「すら」 can also be followed by 「も」, creating 「すらも」, though this is less common than simple 「すら」.\n\nWhile 「すら」 shares a similar meaning with 「さえ」 and 「も」, there are distinct differences. 「すら」 is generally more formal than 「さえ」 and cannot be used in the common conditional construction 「さえ〜ば」. In terms of emphasis, 「すら」 tends to present the **most extreme** example within a large group, indicating that anything below that level also applies. In contrast, 「さえ」 focuses more on the surprising nature of a specific individual case, while 「も」 simply indicates \"also\" or \"too\" without the same degree of extremity or surprise.\n\nConsider the linear relationship of these adverbial particles in terms of intensity:\n*   **[A] は**: [A] is as expected, with nothing surprising about it.\n*   **[A] も**: [A] also fits the category of the main topic, but might be slightly unexpected.\n*   **[A] さえ**: [A] also fits the category, but is quite surprising when examined individually.\n*   **[A] すら**: [A] also fits the category, and is the most extreme example possible, thereby strongly implying that anything below that level also applies.",
