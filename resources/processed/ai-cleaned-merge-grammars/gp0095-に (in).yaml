        "Function": "Indicates the location where someone or something exists.",
        "Usage": "Used with verbs like いる (to exist for animate objects), ある (to exist for inanimate objects), and 住む (to live) to specify a location.",
        "Distinction from で": "While に indicates a place of existence, で indicates a place where an action occurs."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 has its roots in the Old Japanese word 「ni」, which had a broader range of functions, including marking locations, directions, and times. Over time, its usage has become more refined, with its primary function now being to indicate location and time.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 marks the location where something or someone exists. It's often used with verbs such as 「いる」 (to exist, animate), 「ある」 (to exist, inanimate), and 「住む」 (to live). While 「で」 also indicates location, it specifies where an action takes place, whereas 「に」 specifies where something *is*.",
