        "usage-context": "Used primarily with verbs expressing existence (ある, いる) or residence (住む) to indicate the static location where something or someone is found.",
        "function": "To mark the location of existence or state of being.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes a static, non-volitional presence or position, rather than an action taking place.",
        "counterpoint": "Distinct from で (de), which marks the location where an action or event occurs. に indicates where something is, while で indicates where something happens."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 has its roots in the Old Japanese word 「ni」, which had a broader range of functions, including marking locations, directions, and times. Over time, its usage has become more refined, with its primary function now being to indicate location and time.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 unequivocally marks the location where something or someone **exists** or **resides**. It is employed with verbs that describe states of being, such as 「いる」 (to exist, for animate beings), 「ある」 (to exist, for inanimate objects), and 「住む」 (to live or reside). The fundamental distinction between 「に」 and 「で」 is crucial: while 「で」 specifies the place where an **action** takes place, 「に」 specifies the place where a **static entity** is located or a **state** persists. This indicates a fixed point, destination, or a state of being at a particular location. For example, you would use 「に」 to state where a book is located, or where a person lives, but 「で」 to describe where you read the book or where an event occurred.",

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「に」 and 「で」 denote location, their functions diverge critically: 「に」 is used to specify the static location of existence (where something *is*), while 「で」 is used to specify the location where an action *occurs*. For instance, 「部屋にいます」 (I am in the room) states your presence, whereas 「部屋で勉強します」 (I study in the room) indicates where the action of studying takes place. Understanding this distinction is key to their correct application.",

            "etymology": "The word 「部屋」 (heya) meaning 'room' is formed from 「部」 (bu) meaning 'part, section' and 「屋」 (ya) meaning 'house, shop'. This combination implies a partitioned space within a larger structure. 「テレビ」 (terebi) is a loanword from English 'television'."

            "speaker_age": "younger",
            "nuance": "The casual 「います」 and the simple sentence structure are typical for a younger female speaker communicating with a parent. The lack of honorifics or formal language indicates familiarity. The optional 「よ」 in 「犬 いる よ」 adds a personal, informal touch, common in casual speech.",
            "etymology": "The word 「犬」 (inu) meaning 'dog' is an ancient Japanese word. 「にわ」 (niwa) for 'garden/yard' is also a native Japanese word, referring to a space, often enclosed, for cultivation or recreation. 「ワンちゃん」 (wanchan) is an affectionate term for a dog, derived from the onomatopoeia for a dog's bark, 'wan-wan'."

            "nuance": "The casual tone and use of 「います」 indicate a relaxed conversation between friends, typical for younger speakers. The use of 「うちの」 in 「うちの がっこう」 is a common informal way for younger speakers, including males, to refer to 'my school'. The focus is simply on the fact of the teacher's presence.",
            "etymology": "「学校」 (gakkou) meaning 'school' combines 「学」 (gaku) 'study' and 「校」 (kou) 'school'. 「先生」 (sensei) meaning 'teacher' combines 「先」 (sen) 'before, ahead' and 「生」 (sei) 'life, birth', implying someone who was born before and thus has experience/knowledge."

The conversational use of 「ペン、あります よ」 by omitting 「が」 and adding 「よ」 is very natural in polite speech.",
            "etymology": "「机」 (tsukue) meaning 'desk' has existed in Japanese since ancient times. 「上」 (ue) meaning 'on, above' is a common spatial noun. 「ペン」 (pen) is a loanword from English."

            "nuance": "The use of 「入っています」 emphasizes the static condition of the pen being *inside* the box, fitting the particle 「に」 for location of existence. The polite form is appropriate for a neutral, informative exchange. The casual 「入ってる」 is common when speaking informally. The final version with 「よ」 is common in conversational polite speech.",
            "etymology": "「箱」 (hako) meaning 'box' is a native Japanese word. 「入っています」 (haitte imasu) is the progressive form of 「入る」 (hairu) meaning 'to enter', here indicating a state of having entered and remaining inside."

The use of 「ね」 in 「小鳥 いる ね」 seeks soft confirmation or engagement from the listener, common in casual conversation.",
            "etymology": "「木」 (ki) meaning 'tree' is a fundamental Japanese word. 「小鳥」 (kotori) meaning 'small bird' combines 「小」 (ko) 'small' and 「鳥」 (tori) 'bird'."
