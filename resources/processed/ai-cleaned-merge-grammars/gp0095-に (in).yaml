        "usage-context": "Used primarily with verbs expressing existence (ある, いる) or residence (住む) to indicate the static location where someone or something is found.",

    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 has its roots in the Old Japanese word 「ni」, which had a broader range of functions, including marking locations, directions, and times. Over time, its usage has become more refined, with its primary function now being to indicate location and time.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 unequivocally marks the location where something or someone **exists** or **resides**. It is employed with verbs that describe states of being, such as 「いる」 (to exist, for animate beings), 「ある」 (to exist, for inanimate objects), and 「住む」 (to live or reside). The fundamental distinction between 「に」 and 「で」 is crucial: while 「で」 specifies the place where an **action** takes place, 「に」 specifies the place where a **static entity** is located or a **state** persists. This indicates a fixed point, destination, or a state of being at a particular location. For example, you would use 「に」 to state where a book is located, or where a person lives, but 「で」 to describe where you read the book or where an event occurred.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「に」 and 「で」 denote location, their functions diverge critically: 「に」 is used to specify the static location of existence (where something *is*), while 「で」 is used to specify the location where an action *occurs*. For instance, 「部屋にいます」 (I am in the room) states your presence, whereas 「部屋で勉強します」 (I study in the room) indicates where the action of studying takes place. Understanding this distinction is key to their correct application. Additionally, while 「は」 can mark a location, it functions as a topic marker, drawing attention to the location rather than simply stating something's presence. For example, 「図書館には本があります」 (As for the library, there are books) emphasizes the library, perhaps in contrast to other places, whereas 「図書館に本があります」 (There are books in the library) is a neutral statement of existence.",
