        "part-of-speech": "particle",
        "particle-syntactic-function": "locative",
        "usage-context": "Used primarily with verbs expressing existence (ある, いる) or residence (住む) to indicate the static location where something or someone is found.",
        "function": "To mark the location of existence or state of being.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes a static, non-volitional presence or position, rather than an action taking place.",
        "counterpoint": "Distinct from で (de), which marks the location where an action or event occurs. に indicates where something is, while で indicates where something happens."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 has its roots in the Old Japanese word 「ni」, which had a broader range of functions, including marking locations, directions, and times. Over time, its usage has become more refined, with its primary function now being to indicate location and time.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 unequivocally marks the location where something or someone **exists** or **resides**. It is employed with verbs that describe states of being, such as 「いる」 (to exist, for animate beings), 「ある」 (to exist, for inanimate objects), and 「住む」 (to live or reside). The fundamental distinction between 「に」 and 「で」 is crucial: while 「で」 specifies the place where an **action** takes place, 「に」 specifies the place where a **static entity** is located or a **state** persists. This indicates a fixed point, destination, or a state of being at a particular location. For example, you would use 「に」 to state where a book is located, or where a person lives, but 「で」 to describe where you read the book or where an event occurred.",
