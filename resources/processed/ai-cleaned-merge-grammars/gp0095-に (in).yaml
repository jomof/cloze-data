    "writeup": "The particle に primarily indicates the location where something or someone exists or where an action takes place. It's often used with verbs like 「いる」 (to exist for animate objects), 「ある」 (to exist for inanimate objects), and 「住む」 (to live). Think of it as establishing a specific \"in,\" \"at,\" or \"on\" relationship between a subject and a place. When used with a location and a verb like 「ある」, it denotes the existence of something at that location, like 「本は机の上にあります」 (The book is on the desk). Similarly, with 「住む」, it indicates where someone resides, such as 「東京に住んでいます」 (I live in Tokyo). Also, に can also be used to express a relative location. For example, 「隣に座る」 means to sit next to (someone).",
