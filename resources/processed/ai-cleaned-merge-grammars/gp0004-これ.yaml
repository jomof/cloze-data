    "etymology": "The word 「これ」 originated from the demonstrative prefix 「こ-」 (ko-), indicating proximity to the speaker, combined with the noun 「れ」 (re), a general term for 'thing.'",
    "writeup": "「これ」 is often translated as \"this\" in English, which is generally accurate. 「これ」 is used to refer to something that is physically or emotionally close to the speaker. While often described as a \"pronoun\" in English, it can be more helpful to think of 「これ」 as a substitute noun. It replaces something that has its own specific name but whose name is not needed in the context of the sentence, or whose name is unknown to the speaker.",
