    "writeup": "「多い」 (ooi) is an い-adjective used to describe that there is a **large quantity** or **number** of something. It indicates abundance. Unlike \"many\" in English, 「多い」 cannot be used directly before a noun to modify it. Instead, it typically functions as a predicate, using the particle 「が」 to indicate what is abundant. For example, 「間違い が 多い」 (machigai ga ooi) means \"there are many mistakes.\"\n\nIt is important to remember that 「多い」 describes the state of being numerous, rather than directly modifying a noun in the way that \"many\" does in English. Its antonym is 「少ない」 (sukunai), meaning \"few\" or \"little.\"",
