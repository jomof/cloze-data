    "writeup": "「多い」 (ooi) is an い-adjective used to describe that there is a **large quantity** or **number** of something. It is used to indicate abundance. \n\n*   It's important to note that unlike \"many\" in English, 「多い」 cannot be used directly before a noun, except in relative clauses where it functions as the predicate. Instead, you use it with the particle 「が」 to indicate what is abundant. For example, 「間違いが多い」 (machigai ga ooi) means \"there are many mistakes.\"\n*   The antonym of 「多い」 is 「少ない」 (sukunai), which means \"few\" or \"little.\"",
