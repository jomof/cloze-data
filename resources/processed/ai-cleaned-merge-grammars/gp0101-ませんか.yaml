    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ませんか」 is derived from the ます form of a verb, conjugated into its negative form 「ません」, followed by the question particle 「か」. This construction creates a polite question implying an invitation or suggestion. 「ます」 indicates politeness, 「ません」 negates the verb, and 「か」 turns the phrase into a question.",
    "writeup": "「ませんか」 is a polite expression used to invite someone to do something with you or make a suggestion. It's equivalent to asking, \"Won't you do (A) with me?\" or \"Would you like to?\". While similar to 「ましょうか」, 「ませんか」 more directly conveys an invitation, whereas 「ましょうか」 can sound more like a suggestion.\n\n*   **Register:** This expression is inherently polite, so it's suitable for use with people you don't know well or in more formal situations.\n*   **Usage:** To emphasize that you want to do something 'together,' you can add 「一緒に (いっしょに)」, meaning 'together,' for clarification.",
