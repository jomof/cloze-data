    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ませんか」 is derived from the ます form of a verb, conjugated into its negative form 「ません」, followed by the question particle 「か」. This construction creates a polite question implying an invitation or suggestion. 「ます」 indicates politeness, 「ません」 negates the verb, and 「か」 turns the phrase into a question.",
    "writeup": "「ませんか」 is a polite expression used to invite someone to do something with you or to make a suggestion. It is equivalent to asking, \"Won't you do (A) with me?\" or \"Would you like to?\". This expression is inherently polite, making it suitable for use with people you don't know well or in more formal situations.\n\nWhile similar to 「ましょうか」, 「ませんか」 more directly conveys an invitation. 「ましょうか」, on the other hand, often sounds more like a general suggestion or an offer from the speaker to perform an action. For example, 「手伝いましょうか」 (Shall I help you?) is an offer, whereas 「手伝いませんか」 (Won't you help?) is an invitation to the listener to take the action of helping.\n\nThe casual equivalent of 「ませんか」 is 「ないか」. While 「ませんか」 maintains a polite and inviting tone, 「ないか」 can be a more direct, and sometimes forceful, suggestion or invitation. It is generally reserved for use among close friends or in situations where politeness is not paramount.\n\nTo emphasize that you want to do something 'together', you can add 「一緒に (いっしょに)」, meaning 'together', for clarification. This helps reinforce the collaborative nature of the invitation.",
