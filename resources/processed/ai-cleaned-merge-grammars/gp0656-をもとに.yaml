    "etymology": "「を」 is a particle indicating the object of an action. 「元 (もと)」 means \"origin\" or \"source.\" 「に」 is a particle indicating a direction or purpose. Therefore, 「をもとに」 literally translates to \"with (something) as the origin.\"",
    "writeup": "When linked to a noun, 「をもとに」 indicates that something is \"based on (A),\" \"from (A),\" or \"according to (A).\" The literal meaning is similar to \"with (A) as the origin, (B),\" and it's primarily used to reference a source from which something is created or started.\n\nMost of the time, 「をもとに」 will be written in hiragana, but you may also see it as 「を元に」.\n\nAs this grammar pattern mainly highlights the origin of something, it's often seen with verbs like 「書く」 (to write), 「できる」 (to be able), and 「作る」 (to make).\n\n「をもとに」 differs from 「に基づいて」. While 「に基づいて」 indicates a foundation from which a judgment or conclusion of (B) is made, 「をもとに」 focuses more on being a source of inspiration for (B) or enabling (B).",
