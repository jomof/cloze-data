    "etymology": "「を」 is a particle indicating the object of an action. 「元 (もと)」 means \"origin\" or \"source.\" 「に」 is a particle indicating a direction or purpose. Therefore, 「をもとに」 literally translates to \"with (something) as the origin.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「**をもとに**」, formed by the object particle 「を」, the noun 「元 (もと)」 meaning 'origin' or 'source', and the particle 「に」, serves to indicate that something is **based on**, **from**, or **according to** a particular source. It literally conveys the idea of \"with (something) as the origin.\"\n\nThis expression is primarily used to reference a foundational source from which something is created, started, or derived. It emphasizes the origin as the raw material, inspiration, or primary information that enables the subsequent action or creation. Therefore, it frequently appears with verbs related to creation, production, or derivation, such as 「書く」 (to write), 「作る」 (to make), 「開発する」 (to develop), and 「分析する」 (to analyze).\n\nWhile 「**をもとに**」 can be written with the kanji 「を元に」, it is more commonly seen written entirely in hiragana as 「をもとに」.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish 「**をもとに**」 from similar expressions like 「**に基づいて**」. While both can be translated as \"based on,\" their nuances differ significantly. 「**をもとに**」 focuses on the source as an origin or inspiration for creation, suggesting something new is developed *from* it. In contrast, 「**に基づいて**」 implies a stricter adherence to a rule, standard, or established foundation from which a judgment, decision, or conclusion is made. Think of 「**をもとに**」 as using the source as a blueprint or raw material, while 「**に基づいて**」 uses it as a strict guideline or rule to follow.",
