    "etymology": "「上」 (jou) as a suffix often implies a higher-level perspective or a specific viewpoint. It's derived from the original meaning of 「上」 as 'above' or 'on,' suggesting an overarching view or a consideration from a particular angle.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「上」 (jou) is attached to nouns to indicate that something is being considered \"from the standpoint of\" or \"in terms of\" that noun. It is similar to saying \"regarding\" or \"concerning.\" It's fairly formal and often used with broad fields like 「法律」 (law), 「経済」 (economics), or 「教育」 (education). 「上」 highlights the specific area of concern.  **Important:** 「上」 cannot be used to indicate an individual person's point of view; use 「〜からすると」 instead.",
