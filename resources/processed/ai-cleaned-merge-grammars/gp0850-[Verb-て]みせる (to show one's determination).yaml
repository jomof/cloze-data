meaning: to show one's determination
pronunciation:
  katakana: 〜テミセル
  romaji: ~te miseru
formation:
  Verb[て] + みせる: Used to express one's strong determination or intention to do something, often to prove
    a point or demonstrate capability.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  function: Expresses strong will, determination, or a challenge.
  nuance: Suggests a speaker's strong intent to perform an action, often to demonstrate ability or commitment,
    sometimes with an underlying challenge or boast. It's about showing someone or oneself.
  counterpoint: Might be contrasted with simple statements of intent (〜つもりだ, 〜ようと思う) which lack the assertive,
    demonstrative nuance.
etymology: みせる (見せる) literally means "to show" or "to display." When combined with the te-form of another
  verb, it extends its meaning to "show by doing" or "demonstrate through action." The core idea of "showing"
  is preserved, but applied to the *act* itself as a proof or demonstration of ability or will.
writeup: The grammatical construction `[Verb-て]みせる` expresses the speaker's strong determination to perform
  an action, often with the implicit or explicit intention of proving their capability, commitment, or
  defiance to someone else or even to themselves. The literal meaning of `見せる` (みせる) is "to show," and
  when appended to the te-form of a verb, it imbues the action with the nuance of "showing by doing."
  This grammar point is commonly used when someone wants to declare their firm resolve, perhaps in the
  face of doubt or a challenge. It carries a more emphatic and assertive tone than simple statements of
  intent like `〜つもりだ` (to intend to) or `〜ようと思う` (to think of doing). It's as if the speaker is saying,
  "Watch me, I'll do it!" or "I'll definitely show you that I can do this." While `〜てみせる` is generally
  neutral in politeness, its assertive nuance means it's more frequently found in casual or semi-formal
  settings where direct expression of will is appropriate.

  - term: Verb[てみる]
    meaning: to try doing (and see what happens)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 〜てみる implies experimenting or trying something out to see the result, without the strong determination
      or demonstration aspect of 〜てみせる. It's exploratory.
    grammar_point: Verb[てみる] (try doing)
  - term: Verb[dictionary]つもりだ
    meaning: to intend to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜つもりだ simply states an intention or plan, lacking the forceful, demonstrative aspect of 〜てみせる.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]つもりだ (to intend to)'
  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う
    meaning: to think of doing; to intend to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Expresses a thought or a less firm intention, unlike the determined declaration of 〜てみせる.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[volitional-よう]+思う (intend to)
  - term: Verb[(ら)れる]
    meaning: can do; is able to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜(ら)れる describes inherent or acquired ability, not the active demonstration or determination
      to *prove* that ability like 〜てみせる.
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
post_false_friends_writeup: While `〜てみせる` (to show one's determination) and `〜てみる` (to try doing) share
  a similar sound, their meanings and usages are distinct. `〜てみせる` conveys a strong will to achieve something,
  often to prove a point, whereas `〜てみる` suggests an experimental attempt to see the outcome. Similarly,
  `〜つもりだ` and `〜ようと思う` simply state an intention without the assertive, demonstrative force of `〜てみせる`.
  When using `〜てみせる`, remember that it implies not just doing an action, but doing it *to show* or *to
  prove* something.
