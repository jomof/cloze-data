etymology: The kanji 南 (minami) is a pictographic character that has evolved over time. Its ancient form
  depicted a musical instrument, possibly a drum or bell, or a flag. The connection to "south" is thought
  to derive from the direction towards which such instruments were typically played or where flags would
  flutter in a warm breeze, symbolizing a warm, bright direction.
writeup: |-
  南 (minami) refers to the cardinal direction "south." It is one of the four main directions: 東 (higashi - east), 西 (nishi - west), 南 (minami - south), and 北 (kita - north). Like other cardinal directions, 南 can be used as a standalone noun or combined with particles to indicate location, direction, or modification.

  When used to indicate a location, it often takes the particle に (ni) or で (de). For movement towards the south, へ (e) or に (ni) are common. It can also modify a noun using the particle の (no), such as 南の風 (minami no kaze - southern wind).

  Japanese directional terms are often used relatively. For instance, 「駅の南」 (eki no minami) means "to the south of the station." Understanding the relationship between the reference point and the direction is key.

post_false_friends_writeup: While 南 (minami) is one of the cardinal directions, it's important to distinguish
  it from other positional terms. 「上」 (ue), 「下」 (shita), 「前」 (mae), 「後ろ」 (ushiro), 「右」 (migi), and 「左」
  (hidari) describe relative positions (up, down, front, back, right, left) rather than fixed points on
  a compass. Cardinal directions like 南 (minami) are absolute and do not change based on the observer's
  perspective, whereas relative positions do. For instance, "right" changes depending on which way you
  are facing, but "south" always points in the same direction.
examples:
  - english: The south is over there.
    japanese:
      - 南 は あそこ です。
      - 南 は あそこ だ。
      - 南 は あそこ だ よ。
    english_literally: South is over there.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 南 に あそこ が あり ます。
        english: Over there exists in the south.
        hint: This phrasing would mean 'over there' is *in* the south, rather than 'the south *is* over
          there.' We're looking for a simple declarative statement of location.
    scene: A tour guide pointing out directions to a group of tourists.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This is a straightforward declarative sentence indicating the direction of south. The use
      of 「あそこ」 (asoko) points to a place distant from both the speaker and listener.
  - english: The train station is to the south of the hotel.
    japanese:
      - ホテル の 南 に 駅 が あり ます。
      - ホテル の 南 に 駅 が ござい ます。

    english_literally: Hotel's south to station exists.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ホテル の 南 です、駅 は。
        english: The station is the south of the hotel.
        hint: While understandable, this is a less natural way to state a fixed location. The focus should
          be on the station's existence *at* a location relative to the hotel. We're looking for a statement
          about static existence.
    scene: Giving directions to someone asking for the train station.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: This sentence uses 「〜の南に」 (no minami ni) to specify a location relative to a landmark, which
      is a common way to give directions in Japanese. The 「あります」 (arimasu) implies the static existence
      of the station.
  - english: We need to head south from here.
    japanese:
      - ここ から 南 へ 進む 必要 が あり ます。
      - ここ から 南 へ 行く 必要 が あり ます。

          - ここ から 南 に 行か なけれ ば なり ませ ん。
        english: From here, we must go to the south.
        hint: This emphasizes 'must go' rather than 'need to head' and uses 'to' rather than 'towards'.
          We're looking for a phrasing that indicates a necessary action of heading in a direction.
    scene: Two hikers consulting a map.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: The particle 「へ」 (e) clearly indicates the direction of movement. 「進む 必要があります」 (susumu hitsuyou
      ga arimasu) conveys a necessity or need to proceed, fitting for a planning conversation like hiking.
  - english: A warm southern wind is blowing today.
    japanese:
      - 今日 は 暖かい 南 の 風 が 吹い て い ます。
      - 今日 は 暖かい 南風 が 吹い て い ます。
      - 今日 は 暖かい 南 の 風 が 吹い て おり ます。
    english_literally: Today warm south's wind blowing is.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 南 に 暖かい 風 が 吹い て い ます。
        english: Today, a warm wind is blowing in the south.
        hint: This sentence means the wind is blowing *in* the southern region, not that the wind itself
          *originates* from the south. We're looking for a wind *from* the south.
    scene: Someone commenting on the weather.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: Here, 南 (minami) modifies 風 (kaze - wind) using the particle の (no), specifying the origin
      of the wind. This is a typical descriptive use of directions.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 店 は 市 の 南 に あり ます。
        english: This store is located to the south of the city.
        hint: Using just 「南」 might imply it's simply to the south of the city boundary, not necessarily
          *within* the southern *part* of the city. We're looking for the more specific term for a section
          of a city.
    scene: Explaining a store's location.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The term 「南部」 (nanbu) means 'southern part' or 'southern region', illustrating how directional
      words combine with other nouns to form compound terms for geographical areas.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 南 は どこ です か？
        english: Where is south?
        hint: This is a general question about where south is, not specifically from the current location.
          We're looking for a question asking about the direction *from here*.
    scene: A tourist asking a local for directions.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: 「どちら」 (dochira) is the polite interrogative pronoun for 'which way'. This phrase is common
      for asking for directions from one's current location, indicated by 「ここ から」 (koko kara).

    japanese:
      - 南口 を ご 利用 ください。
      - 南口 を 利用 し て ください。
    english_literally: South exit please use.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 南 の 出口 を ご 利用 ください。
        english: Please use the exit to the south.
        hint: While technically understandable, 「南 の 出口」 is less natural for a fixed entrance/exit than
          the compound noun 「南口」. We're looking for the common specific term for a named exit.
    scene: An announcement at a train station.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    nuance: 「南口」 (minamiguchi) is a compound noun, meaning 'South Exit'. The use of 「ご〜ください」 (go~kudasai)
      is a polite and formal way to give instructions or make requests, typically heard in public announcements.
      This specific construction is very common in train stations and large buildings.
    etymology: 「南口」 (minamiguchi) is a common compound noun meaning "south exit." The use of 口 (kuchi)
      for "exit" or "entrance" combined with a direction is standard for station or building exits.

    japanese:
      - 彼 は ずっと 南 の 方 に 住ん でる ん だ よ ね。
      - 彼 は ずっと 南 の 方 に 住ん でる の よ ね。

          - 彼 は ずっと 南 に 住ん でる ん だ よ ね。
        english: He lives way south, doesn't he?
        hint: Omitting 「の 方」 makes the location slightly less general and can imply a more precise point
          rather than a broad direction. We're looking for a phrase emphasizing a less specific, general
          southern area.
    scene: Friends gossiping about an acquaintance.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「南 の 方」 (minami no hou) emphasizes a general southern direction rather than a precise
      point, suggesting a sense of distance or a less specific location. The 「〜んだよね」 (nda yo ne) ending
      is a casual, agreement-seeking tag, common among close friends, especially female speakers, creating
      a warm, conversational tone.
  - english: The northern regions are cold, but the southern regions are warm.
    japanese:
      - 北 の 地域 は 寒い です が、南 の 地域 は 暖かい です。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 北 の 地方 は 寒い です が、南 の 地方 は 暖かい です。
        english: The northern provinces are cold, but the southern provinces are warm.
        hint: 「地方」 (chihou) also means region/province but might carry a slightly different nuance depending
          on context. We're looking for the term used in the original example, 「地域」.
    scene: A geography lesson.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: This example highlights the contrast between directions using 「が」 (ga) as a conjunctive particle
      meaning 'but'. It demonstrates how cardinal directions are used to describe characteristics of different
      regions.
  - english: The house faces south.
    japanese:
      - その 家 は 南 を 向い て い ます。
      - その 家 は 南 を 向い て いる。
      - その 家 は 南 を 向い て おり ます。
    english_literally: That house south is facing.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 家 は 南向き です。
        english: That house is south-facing.
        hint: This is a more concise and common adjective for "south-facing," but it doesn't use the verb
          「向く」 (to face). We're looking for an example that demonstrates the use of the verb 'to face'
          with a direction.
    scene: Describing a house's orientation.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「〜を向く」 (o muku) means 'to face something'. This construction is commonly used to describe
      the orientation of buildings or objects. Facing south in Japan is often desirable for sunlight exposure.
