    "etymology": "「そばから」 combines the noun 「側 (そば)」 meaning \"side,\" and the case-marking particle 「から」 meaning \"from.\" The literal sense is \"from right beside,\" implying something happens immediately following something else. This linguistic construction captures the immediacy and often frustrating or repetitive nature of the subsequent event.",
    "writeup": "「そばから」 indicates that action or event (B) happens immediately after action or event (A). The core nuance conveyed is that (B) often negates, undoes, or otherwise makes (A) frustrating or futile from the speaker's perspective. It can be translated as \"as soon as (A), (B)\" or \"right after (A), (B).\"\n\nThis grammar point emphasizes that (B) is not just a one-time occurrence but typically a recurring, almost inevitable consequence of (A). It highlights a pattern where the beneficial or intended outcome of (A) is repeatedly nullified by (B).\n\n「そばから」 can follow verbs in either their dictionary form or their past-tense form, with no change in meaning. The choice between dictionary and past tense often depends on the speaker's stylistic preference or the tense of the surrounding sentence, but the meaning of immediate succession remains constant.\n\nThis expression carries a formal tone, making it more common in written Japanese or in more serious, analytical speech.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes a recurring, frustrating habit, which 「そばから」 often implies more strongly than 「とすぐに」, which typically denotes a one-off immediate action."
