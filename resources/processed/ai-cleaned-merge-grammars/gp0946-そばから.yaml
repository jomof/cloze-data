    "writeup": "「そばから」 indicates that something (B) happens immediately after something else (A). The nuance is that (B) often undoes or negates (A), or is something undesirable from the speaker's perspective. It can be translated as \"as soon as (A), (B)\" or \"right after (A), (B).\" The register is formal.\n\n*   It usually implies that (B) *always* happens upon (A), rather than a one-time occurrence.\n*   It follows verbs in either dictionary form or past-tense form, with no change in meaning.",
