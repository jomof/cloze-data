    "writeup": "The 「Verb[volitional-よう] + としない」 grammar point expresses a lack of willingness or effort to do something. It's similar to saying \"not willing to\" or \"not making an effort to\".\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   This expression often carries a negative connotation, as it implies a deliberate choice not to act.\n*   It's generally used to describe other people's actions rather than your own. Using it to describe yourself can sound abrupt or rude. In such cases, consider using 「ようと思わない」 instead, which means \"I don't think I will do (A)\" or \"I have no intention of doing (A)\".",
