pronunciation:
  katakana: ニモホドガアル
  romaji: nimo hodo ga aru
formation:
  '[Word or phrase] + にもほどがある': Indicates that something is excessive or beyond reasonable limits. This
    can apply to actions, qualities, or situations that are deemed to have crossed an acceptable boundary,
    often eliciting a critical, exasperated, or, in some cases, humorously admiring response from the
    speaker. The phrase marks the point at which an excessive state or action becomes inappropriate or
    noteworthy due to its extreme nature, suggesting that there's a point beyond which even that thing
    becomes unacceptable or remarkable. For instance, 「親切にもほどがある」 (There's a limit to kindness) implies
    that the kindness is so excessive it's become problematic or overwhelming. It attaches to nouns or
    the plain forms of verbs/adjectives that describe the excessive quality or action being commented
    upon, often followed by a copula if the preceding word is a noun or な-adjective (e.g., 「楽観的であるにもほどがある」
    or 「楽観的なのにもほどがある」).

details:
  register: casual
  function: Expresses that something has gone too far or exceeded an acceptable limit.
  nuance: Carries a critical or exasperated tone, implying that the excess is inappropriate or unreasonable,
    though it can be used humorously for positive exaggeration. It suggests that a boundary has been crossed,
    beyond which the quality or action becomes noteworthy or problematic. This nuance differentiates it
    from simpler expressions of excess, as it implies a judgment of acceptability or a strong emotional
    reaction to the degree of excess. While it can be used in polite contexts, the underlying sentiment
    often reflects mild to strong disapproval or disbelief at the extent of something. The inclusion of
    「も」 adds emphasis, reinforcing that 'even X' (where X is the noun/concept in question) has its limits.
  colocation: Often collocates with qualities that can be excessive, such 丁寧 (politeness), 迷惑 (nuisance),
    楽観的 (optimism), 厳し (strictness), ずぼら (sloppiness), 天才 (genius), 優しい (kindness), 愚か (foolishness),
    図々しい (impudence).
etymology: The expression 「にもほどがある」 is a fascinating construction revealing how Japanese grammatical elements
  combine to convey nuanced meaning. It's comprised of the dative particle 「に」, the inclusive particle
  「も」, the noun 「程 (ほど)」 meaning 'limit,' 'degree,' or 'bounds,' and the existential verb 「ある」 meaning
  'there is.' Historically, 「程 (ほど)」 has long served to denote a proper measure, a suitable extent, or
  a reasonable limit. When combined with 「に」, it indicates the point at which something is measured or
  directed. The crucial addition of 「も」 intensifies this, signifying 'even for this thing/quality.' So,
  the literal essence is "even for this (quality/action), there is a limit/proper measure." The entire
  phrase therefore conveys that a perceived standard or boundary has been violated, leading to the strong
  sense of exasperation, criticism, or exaggerated admiration seen in its usage. It highlights a violation
  of an implicit norm, implying that the excess is beyond what is appropriate or expected.
writeup: |-
  「にもほどがある」 is an expression used to convey that something is excessively so, to the point of being unreasonable or inappropriate. It literally means "even for (this thing), there is a limit." This phrase is often used to criticize or express exasperation when an action, characteristic, or situation goes beyond what is considered acceptable or normal. It implies that a boundary has been crossed.

  While most commonly used with negative connotations (e.g., criticizing someone's laziness or strictness), it can also be employed humorously or to express extreme admiration for positive qualities. In such cases, it suggests that the positive attribute is so outstanding it almost defies belief or expectation. For example, you might hear it used about something incredibly delicious or a truly exceptional talent.

  It is a versatile expression that can be attached to nouns (e.g., 「親切さにもほどがある」 - "There's a limit to kindness"), or to the plain form of verbs and adjectives, often by nominalizing them first (e.g., 「楽観的なのにもほどがある」 - "There's a limit to being optimistic"). The phrasing reflects the speaker's personal judgment that the degree of something has become too much.

  - term: ～すぎる
    meaning: Too much, excessively
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「～すぎる」 also expresses excessiveness, 「にもほどがある」 specifically implies that the excess
      is beyond acceptable limits and often carries a critical or exasperated tone. 「～すぎる」 is a more neutral
      descriptor of an action or state being in excess.
    grammar_point: すぎる (too much・excessive)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「～すぎる」 simply describes an action or state as being excessive, 「にもほどがある」
  implies that the excess has crossed a boundary or become inappropriate, often with a critical or exasperated
  nuance. For example, 「食べすぎる」 means 'to eat too much,' but 「食べ過ぎにもほどがある」 implies that eating that much
  is unreasonably gluttonous, suggesting a judgmental stance on the behavior rather than a neutral description
  of quantity. Think of 「～すぎる」 as an objective statement of degree, and 「にもほどがある」 as a subjective comment
  on the appropriateness of that degree.
examples:
  - english: To use such polite honorifics when meeting for the first time, your politeness is excessive.
    japanese:
      - 初めて 会う の に、そんな に 丁寧 な 敬語 を 使う なんて、その 丁寧 さ {に も ほど が ある}。
      - 初めて 会う の に、そんな に 丁寧 な 敬語 を 使う なんて、丁寧 な の {に も ほど が ある}。
    english_literally: Even though it's the first time meeting, to use such polite honorifics, your politeness
      also has a limit.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 初めて 会う の に、そんな に 丁寧 な 敬語 を 使う なんて、丁寧 すぎる。
        english: To use such polite honorifics when meeting for the first time, that's too polite.
        hint: While 「丁寧 すぎる」 means 'too polite,' it doesn't carry the strong implication that the politeness
          has crossed an inappropriate social boundary. We're looking for an expression that conveys politeness
          beyond reasonable limits.
    scene: A younger person is overly formal with an older person, making the situation awkward.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「丁寧 さ {にもほどがある}」 highlights the excessive nature of the politeness. While not strictly
      age-specific, a younger person might be advised on appropriate social boundaries. It implies that
      the politeness has exceeded what is socially acceptable for the context, creating awkwardness rather
      than respect. The speaker is implying that this level of politeness is crossing a line into being
      bothersome or unnatural. This is expressed through the phrase 「丁寧 さ {に も ほど が ある}」 which directly
      translates to 'even politeness has its limits.'
  - english: You always treat me, but your consideration is excessive.
    japanese:
      - 君 は いつ も ご 馳走 し て くれる けど、そんな に 気 を 使う {に も ほど が ある} よ。

          - 君 は いつ も ご 馳走 し て くれる けど、そんな に 気 を 使い すぎる よ。
        english: You always treat me, but you're too considerate.
        hint: 「気 を 使い すぎる」 simply means 'too considerate.' We're looking for a phrase that implies the
          consideration has become excessive to the point of being a burden or inappropriate.
    scene: A friend always insists on paying for everything, and the speaker is gently trying to tell
      them it's too much.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「気 を 使う」 means to be considerate or thoughtful. The 「よ」 particle adds a gentle, advising tone,
      indicating concern for the friend's excessive effort. 「そんな に 気 を 使う {にもほどがある} よ」 conveys that the
      excessive consideration has reached a point where it's no longer appreciated, implying a crossed
      boundary where their generosity becomes a burden. The speaker is implying that while thoughtfulness
      is good, there's a point where it becomes excessive for both parties. This is expressed by 「気 を
      使う {に も ほど が ある}」 ('even being considerate has its limits').

        english: To listen to music at full volume in the middle of the night, that's a nuisance.
        hint: 「迷惑 だ」 simply states something is a nuisance. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes
          the nuisance is beyond an acceptable limit, crossing a boundary of consideration.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 夜中 に 音楽 を 大 音量 で 聞く なんて、とても 迷惑 だ。
        english: To listen to music at full volume in the middle of the night, that's very annoying.
        hint: 「とても 迷惑 だ」 means 'very annoying' but doesn't convey the sense of an unacceptable breach
          of common courtesy. We're looking for a phrase that implies the behavior has gone too far.
    scene: A person is complaining to their roommate about their noisy neighbors.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「迷惑」 means nuisance or trouble. This example conveys a critical and exasperated tone, implying
      that the neighbors' actions are unacceptable and beyond a reasonable limit, highlighted by 「迷惑 {にもほどがある}」.
      The speaker feels that the boundary of acceptable noise levels has been violated, showing strong
      frustration. This feeling of being pushed too far is captured by 「迷惑 {に も ほど が ある}」 ('even nuisance
      has its limits').
  - english: To expect to pass the exam without studying at all, your optimism is excessive, isn't it?

      a limit, don't you think?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 勉強 を 全然 し ない で 合格 する なんて、楽観 的 すぎる ん じゃ ない？
        english: To expect to pass the exam without studying at all, you're too optimistic, aren't you?
        hint: 「楽観 的 すぎる」 means 'too optimistic.' We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes the optimism
          is not just excessive, but illogical and beyond reasonable bounds given the situation.
    scene: A student expresses disbelief to a classmate who is surprisingly calm about an upcoming exam
      despite not having studied.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: 「楽観 的」 means optimistic. The 「ん じゃ ない」 ending indicates a softer, questioning tone, while
      still implying a critical assessment of the classmate's unrealistic expectations. The phrase 「楽観
      的 {にもほどがある} ん じゃ ない？」 questions whether their optimism has exceeded a reasonable limit and become
      detached from reality. The speaker is pointing out that such optimism is unwarranted and crosses
      the line into delusion. This is emphasized by 「楽観 的 {に も ほど が ある}」 ('even being optimistic has its
      limits').

      degree.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The exclamation 「美味しい {にもほどがある} ね！」 is a humorous hyperbole, often used by females, to express
      extreme admiration, implying the deliciousness has reached an incredible, almost unbelievable level.
      The 「ね」 seeks confirmation or emphasizes the shared feeling of excitement. The use of 「にもほどがある」
      here is an exaggerated positive expression, indicating the deliciousness is beyond the normal scale,
      in a way that is surprising and delightful. The speaker is so impressed that they imply this level
      of deliciousness is almost 'too good' to be true. This exaggeration is common among younger speakers
      and particularly among female speakers who use particles like 「ね」 to invite agreement or share emotion.
      For example, 「美味しい {に も ほど が ある}」 ('even deliciousness has its limits') here means it's incredibly
      delicious, surpassing all reasonable expectations of taste. While not exclusively feminine, this
      kind of expressive hyperbole is a common feature in female speech styles.

    scene: A roommate complains to another about the messy apartment.

      it intolerable. This reflects a judgment that the behavior is not merely sloppy, but excessively
      so.

      expectations, almost to a comedic degree. The 「よ！」 adds emphasis and excitement to the exclamation.

    scene: Students grumbling amongst themselves after receiving a harsh punishment for a minor infraction.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The phrase 「厳し さ {にもほどがある}」 conveys strong disapproval and frustration regarding the teacher's
      excessive strictness. It implies that the punishment is disproportionate to the mistake, implying
      the teacher has gone too far and crossed a boundary of reasonable discipline. The nuance here is
      that the strictness is not just 'too much' but unjustifiably so.
  - english: Taking an hour just to get ready for a short outing, your slowness is excessive.

      contexts, this expression can be used to convey that a behavior has gone beyond acceptable boundaries.
post_example_writeup: Remember that while 「にもほどがある」 is often used negatively, it can sometimes be used
  humorously with positive words to express strong admiration or approval. This adaptability makes it
  a powerful phrase for conveying nuanced opinions about the degree of something. It is important to consider
  the context to determine whether the meaning is critical or complimentary. The key is that something
  has reached an extreme point, exceeding typical expectations or limits.
