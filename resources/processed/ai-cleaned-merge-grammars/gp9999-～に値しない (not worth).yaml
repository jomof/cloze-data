id: gp9999
meaning: Not worth; not deserving of; does not warrant
pronunciation:
  katakana: ニ アタイ シナイ
  romaji: ni atai shinai
formation:
  Noun + に 値しない: Used to express that a noun is not deserving of something or does not have sufficient
    worth for it.
  Verb[dictionary] + に 値しない: Used to express that an action is not worth doing or does not warrant a certain
    outcome.
jlpt: N2
etymology: The expression `〜に値しない` is composed of `値 (atai)`, meaning 'value' or 'worth', and `しない (shinai)`,
  the negative form of `する (suru)`, 'to do' or 'to make'. The particle `に` indicates the object or standard
  against which the subject's worth is being judged. Thus, it literally translates to something like 'does
  not do/make worth for (that thing)', evolving to mean 'is not worthy of' or 'does not deserve'. This
  construction emphasizes a qualitative judgment, suggesting a deficit in inherent merit or a failure
  to meet a certain standard.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point `〜に値しない` is used to state that something, be it a noun or an action, is **not worthy of**, **does not deserve**, or **does not warrant** something. It conveys a strong sense of unworthiness or inadequacy. This phrase is typically used in contexts where a judgment or assessment of value, merit, or deservingness is being made. It can express disappointment, disapproval, or even a sense of indignation.

  When used with a **noun**, it indicates that the noun itself is not deserving of the stated quality, treatment, or recognition. For example, you might say someone's actions are `非難 (hinan)` criticism `に値しない` (not worthy of criticism) meaning they are so bad they don't even warrant being criticized, or they are so good they are above criticism (context matters).

  When used with a **verb in dictionary form**, it means that the action described by the verb is not worth undertaking, or that a certain consequence is not deserved based on that action. For instance, `見るに値しない` means 'not worth watching', implying it's of poor quality or has no merit.

  This expression is generally found in more serious or formal discussions, reflecting a considered judgment rather than a casual remark. Its strength lies in conveying a definitive assessment of inadequacy.

  - term: 〜する価値がない
    meaning: to have no value or worth
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`〜に値しない` often refers to inherent merit, dignity, or deservingness, implying a moral or qualitative
      judgment. In contrast, `〜する価値がない` is broader, referring to practical, monetary, or abstract value.
      The former often carries a stronger sense of disappointment or indignation regarding a standard
      not being met, while the latter can simply state a lack of utility or benefit.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[dictionary]・する + 価値がない (to have no value)
post_false_friends_writeup: While `〜に値しない` and `〜する価値がない` both convey a sense of 'not being worth', their
  nuances differ. Use `〜に値しない` when you want to express that something lacks the **inherent merit, dignity,
  or moral deservingness** to warrant a certain status, recognition, or action. It's often about a judgment
  of quality or ethical standing. For instance, '彼の行動は信頼に値しない' (His actions are not worthy of trust).
  On the other hand, `〜する価値がない` is more general and refers to a lack of **utility, benefit, or overall
  value**. This can be applied to practical situations or things that simply don't provide a return. For
  example, 'この映画は見る価値がない' (This movie isn't worth watching) could imply it's just boring or poorly made,
  without necessarily judging its 'dignity'.

          - 彼 の 臆病 な 行為 は 軽蔑 に 値 する。
        english: His cowardly act deserves contempt.

        hint: This states that the lie is not allowed or acceptable, which is a broader judgment than
          it not being 'worthy' of being told. We're looking for a statement about what it is not worthy
          of.
    scene: A therapist advises a client on the consequences of dishonesty.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: '`つくに値しない` (from 嘘をつく - to tell a lie) here implies a moral judgment against telling a lie
      that causes significant emotional harm, asserting it''s not justified or permissible given its severe
      impact.'
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, `〜に値しない` can be applied to both abstract concepts (like
  'praise' or 'forgiveness') and actions (like 'watching' or 'believing'), always conveying a strong judgment
  about the lack of merit or deservingness. Remember that while `〜に値しない` indicates something is 'not worthy',
  its positive counterpart `〜に値する` means 'worthy of' or 'deserving of', as shown in example 8. Understanding
  both forms will help you express a full range of judgments regarding value and merit.
