        "usage-context": "Used to draw a sharp contrast between two situations or conditions, where the first is presented as a hypothetical, extreme, or less relevant case, and the second is the main, often surprising, point."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ならいざ知らず」 combines the hypothetical form of the auxiliary verb 「だ」 (nara), the adverb 「いざ」 (iza) meaning 'now' or 'well then', and the classically-negated form of the verb 「知る」 (shiru), 「知らず」 (shirazu) meaning 'to not know'.",
    "writeup": "「ならいざ知らず」 is a complex expression combining the hypothetical form 「なら」, the adverb 「いざ」, and the negated form 「知らず」. It is often translated as “I don’t know about (A), but (B)” or “maybe (A), but (B).” This phrase is often considered formal or semi-formal and typically used to emphasize that, regardless of situation (A), situation (B) is definitely the case or fits a specific description. It follows verbs in their dictionary forms, as well as な-adjectives or nouns where their terminal 「だ」 is replaced with 「なら」. It can also follow nominalized い-adjectives using 「の」, though this is less common with verbs.\n\nThis structure highlights that while (A) may or may not be the case or is an extreme example, (B) is a definite or more common reality. The contrast between (A) being unknown or less significant and (B) being definite is key to its meaning. In many instances, (A) is an extreme or unlikely example, used to set up (B) as a more surprising or irritating counterpoint. While not directly translating to 'but', the contrasting meaning arises from the assertion of (B) in light of the uncertainty of (A).\n\nOccasionally, 「は」 may be used instead of 「なら」 (e.g., 「〜はいざ知らず」), but the overall meaning of the phrase remains the same, maintaining the emphasis on the contrast.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Similar to 「〜はともかく」, 「〜はさておき」 suggests deferring discussion or consideration of the first point for the moment. It does not carry the same nuance of 'I don't know about that (extreme case)' or 'that might be understandable' as 「ならいざ知らず」 does, which establishes a more direct, often surprising, contrast."

            "nuance": "「〜ならまだしも」, like 「ならいざ知らず」, introduces a hypothetical or extreme situation, but it often implies that the preceding condition would be acceptable or understandable, contrasting it with the current unacceptable or surprising reality. 「ならいざ知らず」 often carries a stronger sense of dismissal or uncertainty about the first part."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "「ならいざ知らず」は、Aの状況は理解できる、あるいは極端な例として置くが、Bの状況は明確に違う、または受け入れられないという強い対比を示します。一方、「〜はともかく」や「〜はさておき」は、Aのことは一旦置いておき、Bについて話を進める、というニュアンスです。Aを議論の対象から外すという点で共通しますが、「ならいざ知らず」の方がAとBの間の明確な断絶と、Bに対する話者の確固たる意見を強く表します。「〜ならまだしも」は「ならいざ知らず」と非常に似ていますが、「〜ならまだしも」の方が、前件が「それならまだ理解できる」というニュアンスが強く、後件の不合理さを強調する傾向があります。",
