    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ならいざ知らず」 combines the hypothetical form of the auxiliary verb 「だ」 (nara), the adverb 「いざ」 (iza) meaning 'now' or 'well then', and the classically-negated form of the verb 「知る」 (shiru), 「知らず」 (shirazu) meaning 'to not know'.",
    "writeup": "「ならいざ知らず」 combines the hypothetical form 「なら」, the adverb 「いざ」, and the negated form 「知らず」. It is often translated as \"I don’t know about (A), but (B)\" or \"maybe (A), but (B).\" This phrase is formal and emphasizes that, regardless of (A), (B) fits a specific description. It follows verbs in their standard forms, as well as な-adjectives or nouns that have had their terminal 「だ」 replaced with 「なら」. 「ならいざ知らず」 emphasizes that (A) may or may not be the case, but (B) is definite. In many cases, (A) is an extreme example used to show that (B) is the opposite of that, and is therefore either surprising or irritating. Occasionally 「は」 will be used instead of 「なら」, but the meaning remains the same.",
