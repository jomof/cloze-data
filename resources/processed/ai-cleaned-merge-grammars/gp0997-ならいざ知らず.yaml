    "writeup": "**ならいざ知らず** combines なら (the hypothetical form of だ), いざ (meaning \"now\" or \"well then\"), and 知らず (the classically-negated form of 知る, meaning \"to not know\"). It's often translated as \"I don’t know about (A), but (B),\" or \"maybe (A), but (B).\" This phrase is formal and emphasizes that regardless of (A), (B) fits a specific description.",
    "etymology": "The expression 「ならいざ知らず」 is derived from 「なら」 (if it is the case), 「いざ」 (an interjection expressing determination or readiness), and 「知らず」 (not knowing). The etymology suggests a sense of uncertainty or lack of knowledge about the first part of the statement, followed by a contrasting statement about which the speaker is certain.",
