    "etymology": "い-adjectives are called い-adjectives because they end with the hiragana character い. As predicates, they function as the core descriptor of a sentence, stating a quality or state of being. In Japanese, い-adjectives are considered 「自立語」 (jiritsugo), meaning they can stand alone and form a complete sentence. They are also considered 「用言」 (yougen), meaning they can conjugate.",
    "writeup": "A predicate describes the topic/subject of a sentence. The Japanese equivalent of this is 「述語」 (jutsugo), which literally means \"statement word\". As a predicate, い-adjectives can appear by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used at the end of a sentence.\n\nWhen there are no other words apart from the adjective itself, it comes across similar to \"It's cute\" or \"It's hot\" in English. We just have to guess what the \"it\" is from context.\n\nIn many sentences, either は or が could be used to mark the word/words that the predicate is describing. However, which one sounds more natural will depend on many factors. In general, if you are specifically pointing out something as being different from other things in the same category, が will be used.\n\nFor example, 「このお風呂は熱い」 (kono ofuro wa atsui) indicates the normal state of the bath. However, 「このお風呂が熱い」 (kono ofuro ga atsui) is distinguishing this specific bath as having a unique level of hotness compared to others (maybe the water system is broken and only boiling water comes out). は would sound unnatural in this type of sentence, as it is not the \"normal\" state of the bath.\n\n**Important Note:** All い-adjectives are words of Japanese origin.",
