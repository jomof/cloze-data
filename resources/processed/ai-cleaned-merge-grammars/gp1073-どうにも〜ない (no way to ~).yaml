details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: Used to express a sense of helplessness or absolute impossibility, conveying that despite
    efforts, a situation cannot be changed or an action cannot be performed.
  function: Consists of 「どうにも」 (dounimo), meaning "no matter how," followed by a verb in the negative
    potential form, or phrases like 「ようがない」 (you ga nai), meaning "there is no way to," or 「にならない」 (ni
    naranai), meaning "does not amount to/become."
  nuance: This expression conveys a strong sense of resignation and futility. It emphasizes that no matter
    what approach is taken or how much effort is exerted, the desired outcome is unattainable. It often
    implies a complete lack of control or options in a given situation.
etymology: 「どうにも」 is derived from 「どう」 (dou), meaning "how," and 「にも」 (nimo), an emphatic particle. Together,
  they create the sense of "no matter how" or "in any way." The addition of 「ない」 (nai) or structures implying
  impossibility like 「ようがない」 (you ga nai) or 「にならない」 (ni naranai) completes the expression, indicating
  an absolute inability or lack of means. This structure reflects a historical development where the emphasis
  on the method or manner ('how') combines with negation to convey absolute impossibility.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「どうにも〜ない」 is a powerful expression in Japanese used to convey an absolute sense of impossibility or helplessness. It signifies that no matter what action is taken, or how much effort is put in, a certain result cannot be achieved or a situation cannot be changed. This phrase encapsulates a feeling of resignation, often stemming from external factors or an inherent inability that cannot be overcome.

  There are three main patterns for using 「どうにも〜ない」:

  *   **どうにも + V(potential negative)**: This is the most common form, directly stating an inability to perform an action. For example, 「どうにも分からない」 means 'no matter what, I cannot understand.' This emphasizes that despite all efforts to comprehend, understanding is elusive.

  *   **どうにも + V(masu-stem) + ようがない**: This pattern emphasizes the complete lack of a method or means to do something. For example, 「どうにも直しようがない」 means 'there is no way to fix it at all.' It suggests that no approach or repair technique would be effective.

  *   **どうにも + Noun + にならない**: This structure indicates that something is utterly ineffective, useless, or fails to achieve its intended purpose. For instance, 「どうにも仕事にならない」 means 'it's impossible to get any work done at all' or 'work just won't happen.' This implies a fundamental impediment preventing the activity from being productive.

  **Important Considerations:**

  「どうにも〜ない」 conveys a stronger sense of impossibility than a simple negative potential form (e.g., 「できない」). While 「できない」 states a lack of ability, 「どうにも〜ない」 adds an emphatic nuance, suggesting that *no matter what* is attempted, the outcome remains negative. It's often used when the speaker feels overwhelmed, frustrated, or faced with an unchangeable reality. This expression is generally gender-neutral and can be used in various registers, from casual conversation to more formal discussions about insurmountable problems. Its usage typically arises when the speaker has exhausted all apparent solutions and is left with a profound sense of futility.
false_friends:
  - term: どうにもこうにも〜ない
    meaning: absolutely no way to ~, cannot ~ by any means
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どうにもこうにも〜ない」 is a more emphatic and often colloquial version of 「どうにも〜ない」. It adds an even
      stronger sense of complete impossibility or utter helplessness, suggesting that every conceivable
      avenue has been tried and failed. It implies a higher degree of exasperation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どうにもこうにも〜ない (absolutely no way)
  - term: 〜っこない
    meaning: no way, impossible
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「どうにも〜ない」 emphasizes that something is impossible despite efforts, 「〜っこない」 expresses
      a blunt, often dismissive, assertion that it simply cannot be done or is highly improbable, often
      with a sense of resignation from the speaker's perspective. It does not necessarily imply effort
      has been made.
    grammar_point: っこない (no chance of)
  - term: 〜かねる
    meaning: cannot, find it difficult to (politely decline)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜かねる」 indicates a polite refusal or difficulty in performing an action, often due to moral,
      practical, or personal reasons, not necessarily physical impossibility. In contrast, 「どうにも〜ない」 conveys
      an absolute impossibility despite efforts, often due to external factors or inherent inability.
      「〜かねる」 suggests 'it's difficult for me to do this,' while 「どうにも〜ない」 means 'it's impossible for anyone
      to do this, no matter what.'
    grammar_point: かねる (unable to)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「どうにも〜ない」 and 「どうにもこうにも〜ない」 express impossibility, the latter carries
  a stronger, more emphatic nuance. Think of 「どうにもこうにも〜ない」 as saying 'absolutely no way' or 'under no
  circumstances,' whereas 「どうにも〜ない」 is simply 'no way' or 'cannot.' The added 'こうにも' reinforces the idea
  of trying various methods and finding all of them to be fruitless, expressing a higher degree of exasperation.

        english: It's too heavy; I cannot lift it.

          that it's impossible despite one's efforts.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: It's too heavy; there's absolutely no way I can lift it.
        hint: 「どうにもこうにも」 emphasizes an even stronger, more exasperated sense of impossibility, as if all
          imaginable attempts have been made and failed. We're looking for a slightly less extreme sense
          of impossibility.

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: This is a casual, somewhat frustrated exclamation. While 「どうにも」 itself is gender-neutral,
      the plain form 「持ち上げられない」 could be spoken by anyone. Keeping it plain makes it broadly applicable
      while fitting a casual, slightly exasperated tone typical of younger speakers. If a younger male
      speaker were to add a masculine ending, it might be 「持ち上げられないよ」 or 「持ち上げられないぜ」.

    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This expression of profound sadness is gender and age neutral. However, the plain form 「乗り越えられない」
      could be spoken by an older female expressing a deep, private sorrow. If she were to add a feminine
      ending, it might be 「乗り越えられないわ」, but the neutral plain form allows for broader interpretation while
      still conveying the melancholic setting.

    nuance: This situation, being late for a meeting due to external factors, is common in a professional
      setting. The phrase 「間に合いようがない」 emphasizes that despite the speaker's desire, there is absolutely
      no method or means to arrive on time due to the train's stoppage. An older male speaker might use
      this to convey their helplessness and the severity of the situation to colleagues or superiors.
post_example_writeup: These examples demonstrate how 「どうにも〜ない」 is used across various contexts to express
  a feeling of absolute impossibility or profound helplessness. It's crucial to understand that the speaker
  feels utterly unable to change or overcome the situation, regardless of effort, implying a sense of
  resignation or a fundamental barrier.
