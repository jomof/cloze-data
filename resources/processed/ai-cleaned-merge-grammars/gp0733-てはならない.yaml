    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the te-form of a verb, followed by the particle 「は」 and the negative form of 「なる」 (to become). Literally, it means 'it does not become that [you do something],' implying that a certain action is unacceptable or prohibited.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てはならない」 carries the meaning of \"must not do,\" \"cannot do,\" or \"should not do.\" It expresses a strong prohibition or necessity not to perform a certain action. While 「なくてはならない」 (must do) is introduced to many learners early on, 「てはならない」 by itself signifies the opposite: prohibition. It's a combination of the te-form conjunction particle 「て」, the particle 「は」, and the negative form of the verb 「なる」. Although 「ならない」 by itself can indicate that something is 'not possible,' 'not permitted,' or 'cannot be helped,' when following verbs and 「ては」, it can only mean 'cannot' or 'must not.' In order from most casual to most formal, you might see 「てはだめ」, 「てはいけない」, and 「てはならない」 used with little significant difference in meaning. Due to the 「ならない」 variant being the most formal, it is often found in writing or polite speech.",
