        "function": "Expresses prohibition or a strong negative imperative.",
        "nuance": "Implies that an action is unacceptable, impermissible, or detrimental. It carries a more authoritative and universal tone compared to softer forms like 「てはいけない」 or 「てはだめ」. It often reflects rules, laws, or deeply held principles.",

        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a fixed phrase indicating prohibition."

    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the te-form of a verb, followed by the particle 「は」 and the negative form of 「なる」 (to become). Literally, it means 'it does not become that [you do something],' implying that a certain action is unacceptable or prohibited. The historical progression of 「なる」 and its negative form to convey possibility and impossibility, or permissibility and impermissibility, underlies this construction.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てはならない」 expresses a strong prohibition, meaning \"must not,\" \"cannot,\" or \"should not.\" It indicates that a certain action is unacceptable, impermissible, or contrary to a rule, law, or moral principle. While many learners are introduced to 「なくてはならない」 (must do) early on, 「てはならない」 signifies its opposite: a strict prohibition. It is formed by connecting the te-form of a verb with the particle 「は」 and the negative form of the verb 「なる」 (to become). Although 「ならない」 by itself can mean 'not possible,' 'not permitted,' or 'cannot be helped,' when used after the te-form of a verb followed by 「は」, it specifically denotes a prohibition or strong negative imperative. The strength of this prohibition is higher than 「てはいけない」 and 「てはだめ」, making it suitable for formal contexts such as written regulations, public announcements, or when conveying deeply held moral or legal restrictions. While 「てはだめ」 and 「てはいけない」 are also used to express prohibition, 「てはならない」 is the most formal and is frequently encountered in official documents, textbooks, and more polite speech.",

While 「てはいけない」 shares the meaning of prohibition, it is a more common and less formal expression compared to 「てはならない」. Lastly, 「べからず」 is a very formal and older way to express the same strong prohibition.",
