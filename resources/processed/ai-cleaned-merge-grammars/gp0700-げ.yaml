    "etymology": "The suffix 「げ」 originates from the kanji 「気」 (ki), which means \"spirit,\" \"mind,\" or \"feeling.\" The suffix 「げ」 retains a sense of sensing or feeling something, but in a more subtle or indirect way. Instead of directly stating a feeling, it indicates that something *gives off the feeling* of something.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「げ」, sometimes written as 「気」, expresses that something \"gives off the feeling of (A)\" or \"seems like (A).\" It's frequently used with emotions and feelings, where certainty is difficult. \n\nIt's primarily used after the stem form of い-adjectives, but can follow the stem of な-adjectives or nouns, creating a new な-adjective meaning \"(A) seeming.\" This can be followed by 「な」 or 「に」 depending on whether it modifies a noun or verb. 「げ」 is more subjective than 「そう」, indicating lower confidence, because the speaker is \"sensing\" something. Because it expresses something that the speaker is sensing, it can be difficult to explain to others how to use it.",

Reason: Violation of rule: \"If there is a \"speaker_gender\" or \"listener_gender\", then \"nuance\" **must** mention the specific Japanese, in 「quotes」, that would only be spoken by that gender.\" Since `speaker_gender` and `listener_gender` were removed due to lack of gendered language, `nuance` became irrelevant for this purpose.",
        "violation: Edited `false_friends` 'kind' for all entries from 'synonym' to 'similar expression'. Reason: The grammar point `げ` and these false friends share a semantic field related to appearance or state, but they are not directly interchangeable synonyms in all contexts or nuances. 'Similar expression' more accurately reflects their relationship, as they have distinct usage patterns and implications. This aligns with the overall goal of precise grammatical explanation.",
        "contradiction: The schema requires 'at least one male and one female speaker_gender' and 'at least one male and one female listener_gender', but also states: 'Use only if this sentence would typically only be spoken by this gender' and 'If there is a \"speaker_gender\" or \"listener_gender\", then \"nuance\" **must** mention the specific Japanese, in 「quotes」, that would only be spoken by that gender.' As none of the provided example sentences contain inherently gender-specific Japanese (i.e., language that would *only* be used by a particular gender), adhering to the stricter requirement of linguistic justification for speaker/listener gender in the nuance section leads to the removal of these fields from all examples, thus preventing the fulfillment of the diversity requirement."
