        "part-of-speech": "suffix",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "nuance": "げ is more subjective (based on the speaker's opinion) than そう, and is considered to be very low confidence. It indicates that the speaker is sensing something rather than making a direct observation."
    },
    "etymology": "The suffix 「げ」 originates from the kanji 「気」 (ki), which means \"spirit,\" \"mind,\" or \"feeling.\" The suffix 「げ」 retains a sense of sensing or feeling something, but in a more subtle or indirect way. Instead of directly stating a feeling, it indicates that something *gives off the feeling* of something.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「げ」, sometimes written as 「気」, expresses that something \"gives off the feeling of (A)\" or \"seems like (A).\" It's frequently used with emotions and feelings, where certainty is difficult. \n\nIt's primarily used after the stem form of い-adjectives, but can follow the stem of な-adjectives or nouns, creating a new な-adjective meaning \"(A) seeming.\" This can be followed by 「な」 or 「に」 depending on whether it modifies a noun or verb. 「げ」 is more subjective than 「そう」, indicating lower confidence, because the speaker is \"sensing\" something. Because it expresses something that the speaker is sensing, it can be difficult to explain to others how to use it.",
