    "etymology": "The word 「却って」 comes from the verb 「却く (しりぞく)」, which means \"to retreat\" or \"to reject\". It conveys the idea of stepping back from an initial expectation or intention and highlighting the actual result, which is often the opposite.",
    "writeup": "「却って (かえって)」 is an adverb used to express that the result of an action or situation is contrary to what was expected or intended. It implies that an effort or intention to achieve 'A' inadvertently led to 'B', where 'B' is often a negative or unexpected outcome. This nuance can be translated as \"all the more,\" \"on the contrary,\" \"conversely,\" or \"instead\".\n\nThe structure often appears as **(A) 却って (B)**, where (A) represents the initial intention, action, or expectation, and (B) is the actual, often undesirable or counterproductive, outcome. It highlights a deviation from the anticipated result, suggesting that the effort made was not only fruitless but perhaps even detrimental.\n\nConsider the etymology: The origin of 「却って」 perfectly illustrates the grammar point's nuance of \"stepping away\" or \"reversing\" from the initial expectation (A) to reveal the actual, often opposite, result (B).\n\n「却って」 is primarily used in formal contexts, including written language and speeches. It is a nuanced adverb that conveys a sense of irony or an unfortunate turn of events. It is not typically used in very casual everyday conversation.",
