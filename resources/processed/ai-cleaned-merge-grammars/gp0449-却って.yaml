    "etymology": "The word 「却って」 comes from the verb 「却く(しりぞく)」, which means \"to retreat\" or \"to reject\". It conveys the idea of stepping back from an initial expectation or intention and highlighting the actual result, which is often the opposite.",
    "writeup": "「却って (kaette)」 is used to express that the result of an action or situation is contrary to what was expected or intended. It carries the nuance of \"instead,\" \"on the contrary,\" or \"all the more\". The structure 「(A) 却って (B)」 indicates that (A) was the initial intention or expectation, but (B) was the actual outcome, often with a negative or unexpected twist. It's important to note that 「却って」 is an adverb and is used in formal contexts. For example, if one says 「手伝ってくれてるのはありがたいけど、却って邪魔になってるからあっちに行ってくれる？ごめんね。」(I am grateful that you are helping me, but putting that aside, since you are in the way, can you go over there please? I'm sorry.)",
