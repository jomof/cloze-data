    "writeup": "The verb 「すぎる」 means \"to exceed\" or \"to go past.\" When attached to other words, it creates the equivalent of saying something is \"too much.\" It's quite versatile, attaching to verb stems, い-adjective stems (without the 「い」), and な-adjective stems (without the 「な」). You might also encounter 「すぎ」, which is a more casual form of 「すぎる」, where the 「る」 is omitted. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   With 「ない」, the 「い」 changes to 「さ」, resulting in 「なさすぎる」, meaning \"too much not (A)\" or, more naturally, \"not enough (A).\"\n*   Remember to use 「では」 or 「じゃ」 after な-adjectives when using the 「ない」 form.\n*   For 「いい」 (good), the stem form is 「よ」, not 「い」. Therefore, \"too good\" is 「よすぎる」, not 「いすぎる」.\n*   Be aware that 「すぎる」 itself can be negated, which can cause confusion. Pay attention to where the 「ない」 is placed to understand the intended meaning.",
    "etymology": "The kanji for 「過」 (used in 「過ぎる」) implies excess or passing beyond a limit. This aligns with its grammatical function of indicating something exceeds a reasonable or desired level.",
