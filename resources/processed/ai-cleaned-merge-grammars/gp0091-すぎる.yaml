    "etymology": "The kanji for 「過」 (used in 「過ぎる」) implies excess or passing beyond a limit. This aligns with its grammatical function of indicating something exceeds a reasonable or desired level.",
    "writeup": "「すぎる」 is an auxiliary verb that attaches to other words to convey the meaning of something being \"too much\" or \"excessive,\" akin to \"to exceed\" or \"to go past.\" It attaches to:\n*   **Verb ます-stem**: For example, 食べます (tabemasu) becomes 食べすぎる (tabesugiru - to eat too much).\n*   **い-Adjective stem**: Remove the final 「い」, for instance, 暑い (atsui - hot) becomes 暑すぎる (atsusugiru - too hot).\n*   **な-Adjective stem**: Remove the final 「な」, for example, 静かな (shizukana - quiet) becomes 静かすぎる (shizukasugiru - too quiet).\n\nA common casual variation is to omit the final 「る」, using just 「すぎ」. This is a common pattern, especially in spoken Japanese.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Negative Form with 「ない」**: When 「すぎる」 is used with 「ない」, the 「い」 of 「ない」 changes to 「さ」, forming 「なさすぎる」. This expresses \"too much not (something)\" or, more naturally, \"not enough (something).\" For example, 食べなさすぎる (tabenasasugiru - not eating enough). In casual speech, the 「さ」 can sometimes be omitted, though technically incorrect.\n*   **Irregular 「いい」**: For the adjective 「いい」 (good), its stem is 「よ」, not 「い」. Therefore, to say \"too good,\" you must use 「よすぎる」 (yosugiru), not 「いすぎる」.\n*   **Negation of 「すぎる」 Itself**: Because 「すぎる」 is a verb, it can also be conjugated into its own negative forms (e.g., すぎない, すぎません). The meaning can change significantly depending on where the negation is placed in the sentence. For instance, 「しなさすぎる」 (not doing enough) is different from 「しすぎない」 (not doing too much). Pay close attention to these nuances for precise understanding.",
