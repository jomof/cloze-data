    "etymology": "The kanji for 「過」 (used in 「過ぎる」) implies excess or passing beyond a limit. This aligns with its grammatical function of indicating something exceeds a reasonable or desired level.",
    "writeup": "「すぎる」 is an auxiliary verb in Japanese that attaches to other words to convey the meaning of something being \"too much\" or \"excessive.\" It implies that an action or state goes beyond an appropriate or desired limit. This sense is derived from the main verb 「過ぎる」 (sugiru), which means \"to pass,\" \"to exceed,\" or \"to go past.\"\n\n「すぎる」 attaches to:\n\n*   **Verb ます-stem**: For example, 食べます (tabemasu) becomes 食べ{すぎる} (tabesugiru - to eat too much).\n*   **い-Adjective stem**: Remove the final 「い」. For instance, 暑い (atsui - hot) becomes 暑{すぎる} (atsusugiru - too hot).\n*   **な-Adjective stem**: Remove the final 「な」. For example, 静かな (shizukana - quiet) becomes 静か{すぎる} (shizukasugiru - too quiet).\n\nA common casual variation is to omit the final 「る」, using just 「すぎ」. This is a prevalent pattern, especially in spoken Japanese, emphasizing a sense of casualness or directness.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Negative Form with 「ない」**: When 「すぎる」 is used with 「ない」, the 「い」 of 「ない」 typically changes to 「さ」, forming 「なさすぎる」. This expresses \"too much not (something)\" or, more naturally, \"not enough (something).\" For example, 食べなさ{すぎる} (tabenasasugiru - not eating enough). While grammatically 「～なさすぎる」 is standard, in very casual speech, particularly among younger people, the 「さ」 can sometimes be omitted (e.g., 食べな{すぎる}), though this is technically less formal.\n*   **Irregular 「いい」**: The adjective 「いい」 (good) has an irregular stem. When attaching 「すぎる」, you must use its stem 「よ」, not 「い」. Therefore, to say \"too good,\" the correct form is 「よすぎる」 (yosugiru), not 「いすぎる」.\n*   **Negation of 「すぎる」 Itself**: Since 「すぎる」 functions as a verb, it can also be conjugated into its own negative forms (e.g., すぎない, すぎません). The meaning can change significantly depending on where the negation is placed in the sentence. For instance, 「しなさすぎる」 (not doing enough) is distinct from 「しすぎない」 (not doing too much). Pay close attention to these nuances for precise understanding and usage, as they can sometimes be a source of confusion for learners.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「あまり」 and 「あまりに」 can imply a high degree of something, they function differently from 「すぎる」. 「すぎる」 is an auxiliary verb that attaches directly to verb or adjective stems, emphasizing the excessive nature of an action or state inherent to the modified word. On the other hand, 「あまり」 and 「あまりに」 are adverbs that modify the entire sentence or phrase, often highlighting the result of an extreme degree, but without the direct sense of 'overdoing' or 'excess' that 「すぎる」 conveys. Similarly, simple negative forms like 「～ない」 express a lack or prohibition, but 「～なさすぎる」 and 「～すぎない」 specifically focus on the *excessive* nature of that lack or the *excessive* avoidance of an action, providing a more nuanced meaning.",
