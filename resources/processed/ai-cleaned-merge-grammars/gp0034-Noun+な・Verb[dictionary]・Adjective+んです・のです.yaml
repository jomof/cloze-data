        "nuance": "Adds a sense of shared understanding or context, implying that the statement is a reason or explanation for something implied or observed.

        "grammatical-role": "Sentence-final auxiliary"
    },
    "etymology": "The 'の' in 'のです' originally served as a formal explanatory particle, evolving from the nominalizer 'の' (noun-forming particle). It essentially turned the preceding clause into a noun phrase, which was then followed by the copula 'です'. Over time, 'の' was often shortened to 'ん' in casual speech for ease of pronunciation, giving rise to 'んです'. The 'です' part is simply the polite form of the copula 'だ', making the entire construction a polite way to present an explanation or emphasize a fact.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **Noun+な・Verb[dictionary]・Adjective+んです・のです** is used for providing explanations, seeking information, or placing emphasis on a statement. It's similar to saying \"the reason is...\" or \"it's because...\" in English.\n\n**んです** is the more casual form, commonly used in spoken Japanese. **のです** is a more formal version and might sound a bit stiff in everyday conversation.\n\nThis construction attaches to plain forms of verbs, adjectives, and nouns. For nouns and な-adjectives, a **な** is required before **んです/のです**.\n\nWhen used in a question form (e.g., **〜んですか**), it implies that the speaker is seeking an explanation or the reason behind something observed or known. It adds a nuanced layer of inquiry, indicating the speaker is not just asking for a simple fact but for context or a deeper understanding.\n\nIn informal speech, particularly among younger speakers, male speakers tend to use **んだ** (the plain form of **んです**), while female speakers often use **の** (the plain form of **のです**), especially when expressing emotion or seeking confirmation.",
