    "etymology": "The grammar point 「をめぐって」 comes from the verb 「巡る(めぐる)」, which means \"to go around,\" \"to revolve,\" or \"to surround.\" The 「を」 particle indicates that the noun preceding it is the object around which something is happening or being discussed. Therefore, 「をめぐって」 literally means \"going around\" or \"surrounding\" something, metaphorically implying a discussion or dispute centered on that thing.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「をめぐって」 or 「をめぐる」 is used to indicate that something is the **central topic of discussion, debate, or conflict**. It often implies that there are various opinions or perspectives involved. While it can be used in spoken Japanese, it's more commonly found in **formal writing and speech**, such as news reports, academic papers, or business presentations. 「をめぐる」 is typically used to modify a noun, while 「をめぐって」 is used as a conjunction to introduce a clause.",
