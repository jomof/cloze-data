    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ては」 is a combination of the 「て」-form of a verb (or adjective) and the particle 「は」. The 「て」-form indicates a reason or cause, and 「は」 adds a nuance of contrast or emphasis, highlighting the negative consequence that follows.",

    "writeup": "「ては」 expresses that if a certain condition is met, a negative result will follow. It can be translated as \"if,\" \"when,\" or \"because,\" but it always carries a negative connotation. It indicates that the speaker believes the condition will lead to an undesirable outcome. \n\nWhen 「ては」 follows a noun or a *na*-adjective, 「では」 is used instead. 「ては」 and 「では」 are often shortened to 「じゃ」 or 「ちゃ」 in casual speech. This grammar point is most commonly used in everyday conversations.",
