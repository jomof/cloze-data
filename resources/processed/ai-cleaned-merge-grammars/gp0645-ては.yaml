        "usage-context": "Used to make assessments or judgments about potential situations, emphasizing a negative outcome. It can also highlight repeating actions that lead to negative results.",
        "function": "To express a conditional relationship where the condition inevitably leads to an undesirable consequence.",
        "nuance": "Always carries a negative connotation; implies the speaker believes the condition will lead to an undesirable outcome. Often used to issue warnings or state a problematic situation.",

    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ては」 is a combination of the 「て」-form of a verb (or adjective) and the particle 「は」. The 「て」-form indicates a reason or cause, and 「は」 adds a nuance of contrast or emphasis, highlighting the negative consequence that follows.",
    "writeup": "「ては」 expresses that if a certain condition is met, a negative result will follow. It can be translated as \"if,\" \"when,\" or \"because,\" but it always carries a negative connotation. It indicates that the speaker believes the condition will lead to an undesirable outcome. This grammar point serves to highlight an inevitable negative consequence of a particular action or state.\n\nWhen 「ては」 follows a noun or a な-adjective, 「では」 is used instead. In casual speech, 「ては」 and 「では」 are frequently contracted to 「ちゃ」 and 「じゃ」, respectively. This informal usage maintains the same core meaning of negative consequence.\n\nWhile 「ては」 can describe repeating actions, its primary use, especially in contexts implying judgment or assessment, is to warn against a potential situation due to its negative implications. It implies a sense of inevitability regarding the negative outcome if the condition described is met or continues.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「ては」, which focuses on a conditional leading to a negative consequence, 「たって」 emphasizes that a result holds true *despite* the condition. It highlights concession or a hypothetical situation that doesn't prevent an outcome."

            "nuance": "While both imply a negative outcome, 「ようでは」 carries a stronger nuance of a negative judgment or assessment about the *current state* or *tendency* of something/someone, which then leads to the undesirable result. It often suggests an inherent flaw or characteristic that is problematic."

            "kind": "synonym",

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference between 「ては」 and other similar expressions lies in the emphasis on the negative result or consequence. While 「たって」 is more about hypothetical concessions and 「ようでは」 focuses on confirming a situation with an inherent negative judgment, 「ては」 specifically warns against an action or state due to its potential negative outcome. 「ていては」 emphasizes the continuous nature of an action leading to a negative consequence.
