    "etymology": "「ございます」 is derived from the classical Japanese verb 「ござる」 (gozaru), which means \"to be\" or \"to exist.\" 「ござる」 itself comes from 「御座 (ござ)」 (goza), meaning \"seat\" or \"presence,\" combined with the honorific suffix 「る」. The original meaning implied being present in an honored place. Over time, 「ござる」 evolved into a polite verb of existence. In modern Japanese, 「ござる」 is rarely used on its own in daily conversation, except in historical dramas or specific traditional contexts. Instead, it almost always appears in its polite 「ます」 form, 「ございます」, which has become a standard polite expression.",
    "writeup": "「ございます」 is a polite expression used to indicate existence or a state of being. It functions as a highly polite equivalent of 「ある」 (for inanimate objects) and 「いる」 (for animate objects). While 「ござる」 is the plain form from which 「ございます」 derives, 「ござる」 is almost never used in modern daily conversation, except in very specific or historical contexts. Therefore, 「ございます」 is the commonly encountered form.\n\n「ございます」 can also function as a highly polite copula, similar to 「です」, expressing identity or attributes. For example, 「私 は 山田 で ございます」 (I am Yamada) conveys a higher level of politeness than 「私 は 山田 です」. It can also be used with adjectives, transforming the 「い」-adjective ending into 「う」 (e.g., 「よい」 becomes 「よろしゅうございます」) or following 「な」-adjectives with 「でございます」.\n\nFurthermore, 「ございます」 can appear after the て-form of a verb, forming a polite version of 「〜てある」. This construction, such as 「用意 して ございます」, indicates a resultant state or a completed action, often implying that something has been prepared for a specific purpose or esteemed person.\n\nWhile 「ございます」 can refer to both animate and inanimate objects, it's important to note that when referring to the existence of people (especially in formal settings), the honorific verb 「いらっしゃる」 is often preferred over 「ございます」, as honorific language conveys a higher degree of respect than simple polite speech. However, in certain contexts, 「ございます」 is acceptable even for people, particularly when functioning as a polite copula (e.g., confirming identity).",
