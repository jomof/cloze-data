    "etymology": "ございます is derived from the verb ござる (gozaru), which means \"to be\" or \"to exist\". ござる is rarely used in modern conversation, with ございます being the preferred polite form. ございます is a combination of ござる and the polite auxiliary verb ます (masu).",
    "writeup": "ございます is the polite equivalent of ある or いる, meaning \"to be\" or \"to exist.\" It's a combination of the verb ござる (御座る), which is rarely used on its own in modern conversation, and the auxiliary verb ます. ござる is more commonly found in historical dramas or other media. ございます is used in polite speech (敬語, keigo). It can refer to both animate and inanimate objects, although いらっしゃる is preferred when referring to people as it's more respectful (尊敬語, sonkeigo).  でございます is considered its own distinct grammatical structure, and will be covered elsewhere.",
