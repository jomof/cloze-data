    "details": {
        "Register": "General",
        "Usage": "Used to indicate the cessation of a state or action. It is often used with the potential form of verbs to indicate a loss of ability.",
        "Formation (verbs)": "V-nai + くなる",
        "Formation (i-adjectives)": "Adj(i)-stem + くなる",

    "formation": {
        "V-nai + くなる": "Indicates that something no longer happens or is the case.",
        "Adj(i)-stem + くなる": "Indicates that something is no longer in the state described by the adjective.",
        "Adj(na)/Noun + でなくなる": "Indicates that something is no longer in the state described by the adjective or noun."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なくなる」 is formed by combining the verb 「なくなる」(to disappear, to be lost) with the auxiliary verb 「なる」(to become). Thus, it literally means 'to become lost' or 'to disappear,' but is used figuratively to express the cessation of a state or action.",
    "writeup": "「なくなる」 indicates that something has reached a point where it no longer exists, occurs, or is in a certain state. It can be used with verbs, adjectives, and nouns, but requires a specific formation for each. This grammar point is useful for expressing changes in ability, conditions, or states of being.\n\n*   **Verbs:** Combine the *nai* form of a verb with 「なくなる」. This is often used with potential verbs (e.g., 「話せなくなる」- to become unable to speak).\n*   **I-adjectives:** Drop the い from the adjective and add 「くなる」 (e.g., 「高くなる」- to no longer be expensive).\n*   **Na-adjectives/Nouns:** Add 「でなくなる」or 「じゃなくなる」 (e.g., 「静かじゃなくなる」- to no longer be quiet; 「先生じゃなくなる」- to no longer be a teacher).\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   「もう〜ない」 is a similar expression but focuses on the absence of something, whereas 「なくなる」 emphasizes the change in state.",
