    "writeup": "「にしたがって」 is a formal expression that means \"as,\" \"following,\" \"according to,\" or \"in accordance with.\" It indicates that **B** is controlled or heavily influenced by **A**. Often, **B** expresses some kind of ongoing or sudden change caused by **A**. This grammar point is often used in formal or official situations, such as when discussing laws, standards, conventions, or traditions.",
