        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "General use"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ようがない」 and 「ようもない」 derives from the noun 「様 (よう)」, which means \"way,\" \"method,\" or \"manner,\" combined with the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 or 「ない」's more emphatic form 「もない」. It literally translates to \"there is no way\" or \"there is no method.\"",
    "writeup": "「ようがない」 or 「ようもない」 is an expression used to highlight that there is no 'method' or 'manner' in which to do something. It can be interpreted as 'there is no way to (A)', or 'it's impossible to (A)'. This phrase will appear attached to the stem form of verbs. 「ようがない」 often focuses on that the action of (A) is not possible, despite that the speaker may actually want to do it.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n*   Because 「様」 will often appear in hiragana, it is important not to get it mixed up with 「よう」, the auxiliary verb used to create the volitional form of verbs such as 「する」. So, this grammar point is not related to volitional form.",
