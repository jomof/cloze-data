        "(A) という (B)": "The (B) that is called (A), or the (B) known as (A)."

    "pronunciation": {
        "katakana": "トイウ",

    },
    "etymology": "「という」 is a combination of the particle 「と」 (which marks quotations or definitions) and the verb 「言う(いう)」 (to say). Thus, it literally translates to \"that says\" or \"that is called\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「という」 connects two nouns, meaning \"the (B) that is called (A)\" or \"the (B) known as (A)\". It is a set expression, predominantly written in hiragana.\n\nThe verb 「言う」, from which 「という」 is derived, is often misunderstood as simply \"to say.\" In Japanese, 「言う」 fundamentally refers to conveying information that cannot be discerned through mere observation. For instance, one cannot ascertain a person's name simply by looking at them; it requires being told.\n\nConsequently, 「という」 is employed to denote information that requires specific knowledge or declaration, rather than a superficial observation.\n\nWhile you might encounter structures like (A)「という」(B) where (A) appears to be an obvious characteristic, in such instances, the speaker is typically implying that there is a nuance to (A) not immediately apparent, or that their perspective on it differs. This nuance extends beyond just nouns, applying to various word types.",

            "setting": "friendly",
            "nuance": "This is a straightforward question using 「という」 to identify a person by their name and profession. The polite 「〜ますか」 ending makes it suitable for general conversation, whether with a close friend or a new acquaintance."

            "listener_gender": "male",
            "nuance": "The speaker acknowledges a common perception with 「強いというんだけど」, then immediately undermines it with the casual, speculative 「使っているんじゃない？」.
