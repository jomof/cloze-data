        "usage-context": "General usage",
        "function": "Connects two nouns, identifying or naming the second noun with the first. It can also explain or characterize a noun using the preceding clause or sentence.",
        "nuance": "This construction is used for information that cannot be discovered through simple observation, requiring specific knowledge or a declaration. When used for seemingly 'obvious' characteristics, it often implies a hidden nuance or a differing opinion from the speaker."
    },
    "etymology": "「という」 is a combination of the particle 「と」 (which marks quotations or definitions) and the verb 「言う(いう)」 (to say). Thus, it literally translates to \"that says\" or \"that is called\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「という」 connects two nouns, meaning \"the (B) that is called (A)\" or \"the (B) known as (A)\". It is a set expression, predominantly written in hiragana. Its core function is to convey identifying information or a characterization that is not immediately apparent through simple observation. This is crucial for understanding its usage.\n\nFor example, if you look at a man, you cannot know that his name is Bob, or that he works in an office; this information requires telling or knowledge. However, you can tell if he is 'short' or 'tall' by just looking. Therefore, 「という」 should primarily be used to express information that requires specific knowledge or a declaration, rather than mere visual observation.\n\nWhile you might occasionally encounter sentences where (A) is describing something that appears 'obvious' (e.g., a person who is visibly strong described as 「強いという」), in such cases, the speaker typically implies a nuance. This often means something about (A) is not exactly as it seems, or that the speaker's opinion or knowledge differs from general perception. This particular nuance is not limited to nouns and can be seen with various word types.",
