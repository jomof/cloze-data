    "etymology": "「という」 is a combination of the particle 「と」 (which marks quotations or definitions) and the verb 「言う(いう)」 (to say). Thus, it literally translates to \"that says\" or \"that is called\".",
    "writeup": "「という」 connects two nouns, meaning \"the (B) that is called (A)\" or \"the (B) known as (A)\". It's a set expression typically written in hiragana.\n\n「言う」 itself can be misunderstood as simply \"to say.\" In Japanese, 「言う」 often refers to information not readily apparent just by looking. For example, you can't know someone's name just by looking at them.\n\nTherefore, 「という」 should be used to express information requiring specific knowledge, not just simple observations.\n\n(A)「という」(B) may appear where (A) seems obvious, but in such cases, the speaker may imply that something about (A) isn't as it seems, or that their opinion differs.",
