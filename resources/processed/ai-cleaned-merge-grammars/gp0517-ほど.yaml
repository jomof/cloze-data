        "[Noun] + ほど": "Indicates approximation or a limit related to a quantity or time.",
        "[Verb (dictionary form)] + ほど": "Expresses a degree or extent to which an action or state occurs, often to an extreme.",
        "[Adjective (i-form)] + ほど": "Indicates a degree or extent of a quality, often implying a remarkable level.",

        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "Functions as a degree or extent indicator, often modifying verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses.",
        "nuance": "Unlike expressions such as くらい (which focuses on the speaker's uncertainty about an exact number), ほど emphasizes that an upper or lower limit has been reached. It refers specifically to a 'limit' and cannot describe something exceeding it. Therefore, ほど is frequently used to express an exaggerated limit, even when the actual extent is far less.",
        "colocation": "Often found with verbs like `~すぎる` (to overdo), or expressions of intensity like `痛い` (painful) or `驚く` (surprising) to emphasize an extreme degree.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a degree or extent indicator, often modifying verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses.",
        "logical-flow": "Typically follows the element whose degree or extent it describes, connecting it to the subsequent clause that explains the result or implication of that degree."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「ほど」 originally comes from the noun 「程」, which means \"extent,\" \"degree,\" or \"limit.\" Its usage has evolved to function as a particle indicating approximation, degree, or comparison, maintaining its core meaning of bounds or measure.",
    "writeup": "「ほど」 is a particle used for describing rough estimates about the 'amount' or 'degree' of something, or to express that something has reached a certain limit or extent. It can be translated as \"approximately,\" \"to the extent that,\" or \"so much that.\" 「ほど」 attaches to the attributive form of various word types, which is the form that directly precedes and modifies nouns or clauses.\n\nWhile 「ほど」 can indicate approximation, its key nuance, especially when indicating degree, is to emphasize that a certain boundary or limit has been reached, or even surpassed in an exaggerated sense. This makes it particularly effective for conveying extreme situations or strong feelings. Unlike 「くらい」, which might focus on the speaker's uncertainty about an exact number, 「ほど」 tends to highlight the completion or consequence of reaching a specific extent.",

                    "mitigation": "While 'ぐらい' can also indicate approximation, 'ほど' here suggests a slightly more precise or confident estimate, as if the speaker is certain the time is close to exactly ten minutes, rather than just a general ballpark figure. The scene of a casual but practical confirmation emphasizes this slight distinction."

                    "mitigation": "Both 'ほど' and 'くらい' can express an extreme degree. However, 'ほど' is often used when the extent is remarkable or almost unbelievable, emphasizing the absolute limit of the speaker's physical capacity. The speaker's use of 'よ' reinforces the strong emphasis of 'ほど' in this context."

In contrast, 「くらい」 tends to be more general or to express uncertainty about an exact measurement. When choosing between them, consider whether you want to emphasize a precise limit or a general approximation. Additionally, be mindful of specific set phrases like 「ば〜ほど」 and 「ほど〜ない」, as they have distinct grammatical functions that differ from the particle 「ほど」 used in isolation.",
