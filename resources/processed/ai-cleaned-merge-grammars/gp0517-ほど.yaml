    "etymology": "The word 「ほど」 originally comes from the noun 「程」, which means \"extent,\" \"degree,\" or \"limit.\"",
    "writeup": "ほど is used for describing rough estimates about the 'amount' of something. However, unlike expressions such as くらい (which focuses more on the speaker's uncertainty about the exact number), ほど puts emphasis on the upper (or lower) limit of something as having been 'reached'. Due to this, it is usually translated as \"so much that (A)\", or \"to the extent that (A)\". ほど can be added to the attributive form of any word. The attributive form is the form that can be partnered directly with nouns.\n\n**Caution:** Although くらい may be used to describe something that is 'around' a certain extent (regardless of whether it is above or below that extent), ほど refers specifically to the 'limit' of something, and therefore cannot be used to describe something that exceeds the stated limit. Due to this, it is regularly used to express some sort of exaggerated limit of (A), when the real extent is far below that.",

                    "competing_grammar": "あと十分ぐらいで着きます。",
                    "mitigation": "While 'ぐらい' can also indicate approximation, 'ほど' here implies a more precise estimate, suggesting that the arrival time is close to the exact 10-minute mark, rather than just a general vicinity. The scene emphasizes a specific ETA."
