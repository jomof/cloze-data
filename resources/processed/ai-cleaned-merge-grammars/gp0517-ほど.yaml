    "etymology": "The word 「ほど」 originally comes from the noun 「程」, meaning 'extent,' 'degree,' or 'limit.' Over time, it evolved into a particle used to indicate the degree or extent to which something is true.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「ほど」, derived from the kanji 「程」 meaning \"extent,\" is used to express the degree or limit of something. It can indicate 'about' or 'approximately' when used with quantities or time. It also signifies \"to the extent that\" something is true. Unlike 「くらい」, which expresses uncertainty, 「ほど」 emphasizes the upper or lower limit that has been reached. It's often used to exaggerate a limit, implying the real extent is far less. It can be attached to the attributive form of words—the form that directly modifies nouns.",
