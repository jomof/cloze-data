        "[Noun] + ほど": "Approximately, about (used for estimations)",
        "[Verb (dictionary form)] + ほど": "To the extent that, so much that",

        "Register": "Standard",
        "Usage Context": "General",
        "Nuance of Extent": "Unlike expressions such as くらい (which focuses on the speaker's uncertainty about an exact number), ほど emphasizes that an upper or lower limit has been reached. It refers specifically to a 'limit' and cannot describe something exceeding it. Therefore, ほど is frequently used to express an exaggerated limit, even when the actual extent is far less."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「ほど」 originally comes from the noun 「程」, which means \"extent,\" \"degree,\" or \"limit.\"",
    "writeup": "ほど is used for describing rough estimates about the 'amount' or 'degree' of something. It is typically translated as \"so much that (A)\" or \"to the extent that (A)\". ほど can be attached to the attributive form of various word types, which is the form that directly precedes and modifies nouns.",

                    "mitigation": "While 'ぐらい' can also indicate approximation, 'ほど' here implies a more precise estimate, suggesting that the arrival time is close to the exact 10-minute mark, rather than just a general vicinity. The scene emphasizes a specific ETA."

                    "mitigation": "Both 'ほど' and 'くらい' can describe an extreme degree. However, 'ほど' is often used when the extent is remarkable or almost unbelievable, as in the exaggerated silence described here. The formal and descriptive setting aligns well with the strong emphasis of 'ほど'."
