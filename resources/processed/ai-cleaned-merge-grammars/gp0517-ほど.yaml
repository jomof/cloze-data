    "etymology": "The word 「ほど」 originally comes from the noun 「程」, which means \"extent,\" \"degree,\" or \"limit.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ほど」 expresses the extent or degree to which something is true. It can mean \"about\" or \"approximately\" when used with numbers or quantities, similar to 「くらい」. However, 「ほど」 often emphasizes reaching a limit or extreme, translating to \"to the extent that\" or \"so much that.\"\n\n**Key uses:**\n*   **Estimating quantities:** 「あと十分ほどで着きます」 (I'll be there in about ten minutes.)\n*   **Expressing degree or limit:** 「死ぬほど練習した」 (I practiced to the point of death.)\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「ほど」 indicates reaching a certain level, so it implies that the actual level is at or below what's stated. Be mindful of the nuances when choosing 「ほど」 versus 「くらい」.",
