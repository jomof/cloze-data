    "writeup": "聞こえる is a verb that describes something that can be heard, or the way in which something is heard. The most common translations of this verb are \"to be audible\" or \"to sound like (A).\" 聞こえる is an intransitive verb, and literally means \"to give off sound.\" When using 聞こえる, (A) is followed by が and is considered to be the 'source' of the sound. However, the 'way that something sounds' is marked adverbially. This means that an い-adjective is changed to its く form, and な-adjectives/nouns are followed by に.\n\nThe primary difference between 聞こえる and 聞ける (the potential form of 聞く) is that 聞こえる is used to identify sounds that do not require the active concentration of the listener to be heard, like ambient noise. 聞ける is used when the speaker is trying to concentrate on a specific sound and refers to their 'ability' to hear it.",
    "etymology": "聞こえる is derived from the verb 聞く (kiku), meaning \"to hear\" or \"to listen\". Over time, the potential form of 聞く, which is 聞ける (kikeru), has diverged in meaning and usage from 聞こえる. 聞こえる evolved to describe sounds that enter one's awareness without conscious effort, becoming an intransitive verb in its own right.",
