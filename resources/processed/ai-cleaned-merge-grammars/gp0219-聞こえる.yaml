    "etymology": "The verb 「聞こえる」 originally derived from the potential form of 「聞く (kiku)」, meaning \"to hear.\" Over time, 「聞こえる」 evolved into an independent intransitive verb, emphasizing the passive reception of sound rather than the active act of listening.",
    "writeup": "「聞こえる」 is an intransitive verb that describes sounds that **can be heard** or **the way something sounds**. It emphasizes the audibility of sound without requiring active listening. Thus, it means \"to be audible,\" \"can hear,\" or \"to sound like.\"\n\n*   When using 「聞こえる」, the sound source is marked with 「が」. For example, 「音楽が聞こえる (ongaku ga kikoeru)」 means \"I can hear music.\"\n*   To describe *how* something sounds, use an adverbial modifier. For い-adjectives, change the ending to 「く」; for な-adjectives or nouns, add 「に」. For example, 「声が美しく聞こえる (koe ga utsukushiku kikoeru)」 means \"the voice sounds beautiful.\"\n\n**Key Difference**: 「聞こえる」 describes sounds that are passively received, while 「聞ける (kikeru)」 (the potential form of 「聞く」) refers to the *ability* to hear when actively trying to listen.",
