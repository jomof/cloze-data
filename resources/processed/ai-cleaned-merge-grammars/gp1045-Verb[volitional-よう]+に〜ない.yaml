    "etymology": "This construction combines the volitional form of a verb (expressing intention or desire) with the particle 「に」, which here functions to set a condition or circumstance, and the negative potential form of the same verb. It literally implies 'for the purpose of (volitional action), (action) is not possible'. The particle 「に」 in this context can be seen as originating from its function to indicate a goal or direction, thereby expressing that even if one *moves towards* or *intends* an action, the desired outcome (the action itself) cannot be achieved. The pairing of the volitional with the negative potential form strongly conveys a sense of frustration or helplessness.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「Verb[volitional-よう] + に + Verb[potential negative]」 expresses the idea that someone wants to do something, but they are unable to. It conveys a strong sense of frustration, helplessness, or being in a situation where one's desires cannot be fulfilled due to some external or unavoidable circumstances.\n\nThis form emphasizes **concrete or physical circumstances** that prevent the action, as opposed to the dictionary form + に + potential negative structure (e.g., 笑うに笑えない), which often highlights psychological or emotional reasons.\n\n**Formation Notes:**\n*   The verb is repeated: first in its volitional form (e.g., 行こう, 寝よう), then in its potential negative form (e.g., 行けない, 寝られない).\n*   For verbs ending in する, the potential negative form will be できない (e.g., 勉強しようにも勉強できない).\n*   The particle 「に」 is crucial here. While the grammar point is technically defined with just 「に」, it is **very common** for 「も」 to be added after 「に」 (e.g., Verb[volitional-よう] + にも + Verb[potential negative]). This 「も」 emphasizes the 'even if' aspect and is widely used in natural conversation and writing.\n*   Occasionally, the negative particle 「ない」 may be replaced by 「ず」 or 「ぬ」, particularly in more formal or literary contexts (e.g., 寝ようにも寝られず).",

While very similar in meaning, 「Verb[volitional-よう]+に〜ない」 places a stronger emphasis on the external or internal circumstances that *prevent* the action, creating a sense of resignation due to external factors. The volitional form more strongly conveys the 'unavoidable' nature of the impediment. For example, 『寝たくても寝られない』 might simply mean 'I want to sleep but can't,' whereas 『寝ようにも寝られない』 implies 'I'm trying to sleep, but external circumstances prevent me from sleeping.'"

For instance,『笑うに笑えない』 might imply 'I can't bring myself to laugh' due to the content, regardless of effort. In contrast, 「Verb[volitional-よう]+に〜ない」 (e.g., 『笑おうにも笑えない』) more strongly suggests concrete or external barriers making the action physically or practically impossible, regardless of psychological willingness."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「Verb[volitional-よう]+に〜ない」 and its counterparts share the core meaning of 'inability despite desire,' understanding their subtle nuances is key. The volitional form emphasizes that even if you *intend* or *attempt* to do something, external or concrete obstacles prevent it. This highlights a struggle against an unmovable force. On the other hand, expressions like 「〜たくても〜ない」 focus more broadly on the desire itself being unfulfilled, and the dictionary form + に + potential negative (e.g., 笑うに笑えない) often points to psychological or social barriers. Choose 「Verb[volitional-よう]+に〜ない」 when emphasizing that the inability stems from an unavoidable, often tangible, circumstance that renders the desired action futile despite one's best efforts.",
