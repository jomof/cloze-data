    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「に」, indicating purpose or circumstance, with the negative potential form of a verb. The 「よう」form indicates volition. Together, they create a sense of wanting to do something but being unable to.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「Verb[volitional-よう] + に + Verb[potential negative]」 expresses the idea that someone wants to do something, but they are unable to. It conveys a sense of frustration, helplessness, or being in a situation where one's desires cannot be fulfilled. \n\n**Key points:**\n*   The verb is repeated in both the volitional and potential negative forms.\n*   It emphasizes the inability to perform the action despite the desire to do so.\n*   This grammar point often highlights circumstances preventing the action.",
