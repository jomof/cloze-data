        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Generally applicable in situations expressing inability despite desire, often due to external or uncontrollable circumstances.",
        "function": "Expresses a strong sense of inability or impossibility to perform an action despite a desire or attempt to do so, highlighting an external constraint or circumstance.",
        "nuance": "This form, using the volitional, tends to emphasize concrete or physical circumstances preventing the action, as opposed to psychological reasons often associated with the dictionary form + に + potential negative structure.",

        "logical-flow": "Indicates a contradiction where a desired action is rendered impossible by external factors."
    },
    "etymology": "This construction combines the volitional form of a verb (expressing intention or desire) with the particle 「に」, which here functions to set a condition or circumstance, and the negative potential form of the same verb. It literally implies 'for the purpose of (volitional action), (action) is not possible'. The particle 「に」 in this context can be seen as originating from its function to indicate a goal or direction, thereby expressing that even if one *moves towards* or *intends* an action, the desired outcome (the action itself) cannot be achieved. The pairing of the volitional with the negative potential form strongly conveys a sense of frustration or helplessness.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「Verb[volitional-よう] + に + Verb[potential negative]」 expresses the idea that someone wants to do something, but they are unable to. It conveys a strong sense of frustration, helplessness, or being in a situation where one's desires cannot be fulfilled due to some external or unavoidable circumstances.\n\nThis form emphasizes **concrete or physical circumstances** that prevent the action, as opposed to the dictionary form + に + potential negative structure (e.g., 笑うに笑えない), which often highlights psychological or emotional reasons.\n\n**Formation Notes:**\n*   The verb is repeated: first in its volitional form (e.g., 行こう, 寝よう), then in its potential negative form (e.g., 行けない, 寝られない).\n*   For verbs ending in する, the potential negative form will be できない (e.g., 勉強しようにも勉強できない).\n*   The particle 「に」 is crucial here. While the grammar point is technically defined with just 「に」, it is **very common** for 「も」 to be added after 「に」 (e.g., Verb[volitional-よう] + にも + Verb[potential negative]). This 「も」 emphasizes the 'even if' aspect and is widely used in natural conversation and writing.\n*   Occasionally, the negative particle 「ない」 may be replaced by 「ず」 or 「ぬ」, particularly in more formal or literary contexts (e.g., 寝ようにも寝られず).",
