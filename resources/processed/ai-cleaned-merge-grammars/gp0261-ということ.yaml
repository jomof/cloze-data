    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of 「と」 (the quotative particle), 「言う」 (iu, 'to say'), and 「こと」 (koto, 'thing' or 'matter'). Literally, it translates to 'the thing that is said,' but its function is to nominalize phrases.",
    "writeup": "「ということ」 nominalizes a phrase, turning it into a noun-like clause. It's a combination of the particle 「と」, the verb 「言う」, and the noun 「こと」. It's often used to clarify or confirm information. In conversation, 「という」 is often shortened to 「って」. So you'll often hear 「ってこと」. While 「言う」 and 「事」 can be written in kanji, it's very common to see the whole expression in hiragana.",
