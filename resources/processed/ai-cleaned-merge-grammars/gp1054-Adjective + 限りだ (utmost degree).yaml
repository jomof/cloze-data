    "etymology": "The phrase 「限りだ」 originates from the noun 「限り (kagiri)」, meaning \"limit\" or \"extent,\" combined with the copula 「だ (da)」. This construction literally translates to \"it is the limit of (something),\" thereby expressing that a certain quality or feeling has reached its extreme degree or utmost degree.",
    "writeup": "「限りだ」 is a grammatical construction used to convey an **extreme** degree of a particular emotion or state. It is always attached to the plain form of an adjective (either an i-adjective or a na-adjective). This expression is formal and often found in written Japanese or in highly polite spoken contexts. This grammar point particularly emphasizes the speaker's personal feelings or perception. Therefore, it is most commonly used with adjectives that describe subjective emotions or states, rather than objective qualities. For instance, you would use it with adjectives like 「嬉しい」 (happy), 「寂しい」 (lonely), 「羨ましい」 (envious), 「悔しい」 (regrettable), 「心強い」 (reassuring), or 「恥ずかしい」 (embarrassing). It would be unnatural to use it with adjectives describing objective traits like color or size. While other adverbs like 「とても」 or 「非常に」 can also express intensity, 「限りだ」 adds a nuance of the emotion being at its absolute \"limit\" or peak, often implying a profound or overwhelming feeling. It highlights that the speaker's perception of the quality is as intense as it can possibly be.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While expressions like 「あまり」, 「てならない」, and 「てたまらない」 also convey intensity, they carry distinct nuances. 「限りだ」 is unique in its focus on the emotion or state having reached its absolute limit, a peak intensity as perceived by the speaker.
