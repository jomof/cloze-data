    "etymology": "The particle で originates from the continuative (te-form) of the copula だ (da). Over time, it evolved into a particle indicating location, means, or manner of an action.",
    "writeup": "で is a particle with several uses. Its core function is to highlight what is **required** to perform an action or reach a goal. One common use relates to *things*, translating to \"by\" or \"with\" in English. In this context, the item is essential for the action. While other items might work, で singles out the one chosen. \n\nで is also used when groups act together. It indicates the group is the *tool* for the action. \n\nThe difference between と and で as 'with', is that で is used when everyone in the group has the same objective/end goal. と is used when each person is performing the action toward each other, not toward an external objective.",
