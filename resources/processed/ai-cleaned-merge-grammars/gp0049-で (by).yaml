    "etymology": "で originates from the continuative (te-form) of the copula だ (da). Its function evolved from indicating a state or condition to specifying the means or location where an action occurs.",
    "writeup": "で is a particle with several uses in Japanese. Fundamentally, it highlights something 'required' to perform an action or achieve a goal. One such use relates to \"things,\" translating to \"by\" or \"with\" in English. In these sentences, the item is considered essential for the action. While other items might work, で emphasizes the chosen one.\n\nで is also used when groups of people perform actions together. Unlike と, which may also mean \"with\" for people, で implies that the group is regarded as a tool to achieve a common objective.\n\nThe difference between と and で as \"with\" is that で is used when everyone in the group has the same objective. と is used when each person is performing the action toward each other, not toward an external objective.",
