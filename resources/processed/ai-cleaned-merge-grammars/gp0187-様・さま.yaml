    "etymology": "The kanji 「様」 originally meant \"appearance\" or \"state.\" Over time, it evolved to signify the 'state' or 'condition' of a person, implying respect and consideration. Using 「様」 allows one to refer indirectly to one's superior. For instance, 山田様 literally means 'appearance of Yamada', which is a more indirect way to refer to a person called Yamada than simply calling them 山田.",
    "writeup": "「様・さま」 is an honorific suffix used to show respect to the person being addressed or referred to. It is more polite than 「さん」 and is commonly used in formal situations, such as business settings or when addressing customers. It's essential to remember not to use 「様」 for yourself or your family members when speaking to others, as it can be seen as arrogant. This suffix can be attached to names, titles, and even some occupations to express a higher level of politeness. While typically attached to names (e.g., 田中様) or titles (e.g., お客様, for a customer), 「様」 can also be used with abstract concepts or natural phenomena to show reverence or admiration, such as 「神様」 (God) or 「お月様」 (the Moon), endowing them with a sense of personification and respect. This usage extends the honorific beyond human subjects, highlighting its fundamental role in expressing profound respect or awe. In professional contexts, particularly in customer service, it is a crucial marker of polite and deferential language.",
