        "Register": "Formal; polite. Used to show respect or politeness to the person being addressed or referred to.",
        "Usage": "Used with names, titles, and sometimes occupations to show respect. It's more polite than 「さん」and is often used in business settings or when addressing customers.",
        "Common Mistake": "Using 「様」 for oneself or family members when speaking to others is considered impolite. Use 「さん」 or no suffix in such cases."
    },
    "etymology": "The kanji 「様」 originally meant \"appearance\" or \"state.\" Over time, it evolved to signify the 'state' or 'condition' of a person, implying respect and consideration. Using 「様」allows one to refer indirectly to one's superior. For instance, 山田様 is a more indirect way to refer to a person called 山田 than to call him simply 山田, because 山田様 literary means 'appearance of 山田'.",
    "writeup": "「様・さま」 is an honorific suffix used to show respect to the person being addressed or referred to. It is more polite than 「さん」 and is commonly used in formal situations, such as business settings or when addressing customers. It's essential to remember not to use 「様」 for yourself or your family members when speaking to others, as it can come off as arrogant. This suffix can be attached to names, titles, and even some occupations to express a higher level of politeness.",
