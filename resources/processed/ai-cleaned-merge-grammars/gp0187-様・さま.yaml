    "writeup": "様 (さま) is a suffix used to show respect and politeness towards someone. Originally meaning \"appearance,\" 様 allows the speaker to refer indirectly to the person. It is similar to \"Mr.,\" \"Ms.,\" \"Mrs.,\" or \"Miss\" in English but carries a stronger sense of deference.\n\n*   **Usage:** It's attached to a person's name (e.g., 山田様, Yamada-sama) or a title (e.g., お客様, okyaku-sama, \"customer\").\n*   **Formality:** While さん is a general honorific, 様 is more formal and indicates higher respect. 様 is often used in business settings or when addressing someone of higher status.\n*   **Important Consideration:** In everyday conversation, using a person's name + 様 can sound overly formal or stiff. It is commonly used by clerks/attendants in service industries (hotels, restaurants, etc.) when addressing customers.",
    "etymology": "The kanji 様 originally meant \"appearance\" or \"state.\" The use of 様 as an honorific suffix evolved from the idea of indirectly referring to someone in a respectful manner. Referring to someone as 「〜の様」 (literally, \"the state of ~ \") created a distance that showed politeness. Over time, this evolved into the honorific suffix 様.",
