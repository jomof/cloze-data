etymology: The word だって (datte) is generally understood to be a contracted form derived from だ (da, the
  plain form copula) and とて (tote), a particle with concessive or causal meanings. Historically, とて itself
  evolved from と (to, a quotative particle) and て (te, the te-form of a verb or particle). This etymology
  helps explain its dual function of expressing 'even if it is so' (leading to 'but' or 'even') and 'because
  it is so' (leading to 'because' or 'I mean'). The core idea revolves around stating a fact or a proposition
  and then either countering it or using it as a basis for explanation.
writeup: |-
  だって is a versatile and very common expression in casual Japanese, often translated as "but," "because," or "I mean." Its core function is to introduce a counter-argument, an objection, or to provide a reason or explanation.

  When だって is used at the beginning of a sentence or clause, it functions similarly to でも or しかし, but it carries a more casual, direct, and often emotional nuance. It's particularly effective for expressing a protest, refuting an implied statement, or showing exasperation. For instance, if someone asks you to do something you don't want to do, you might simply say "だって…" to convey your unwillingness or to prompt them for clarification.

  When だって is used to provide a reason, it typically follows the plain form of a verb, い-adjective, な-adjective (without な or だ), or a noun. In this context, it's akin to saying "〜からだ" or "〜んだ" but with a more conversational and often defensive or self-evident tone. It implies that the reason being given should be obvious or is sufficient justification for the preceding statement or action.

  だって is almost exclusively used in **casual** conversations among friends, family, or close acquaintances. It is **not suitable for formal** or business settings. It is used by speakers of all genders and across age groups, though its directness might be slightly more pronounced in certain casual male speech patterns or among younger speakers. Understanding its nuance is key to sounding natural in informal Japanese.

  - term: しかし・だが・けれど・しかしながら
    meaning: but, however
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These are more formal or standard conjunctions. They lack the casual, often emotional or defensive
      nuance of だって.
    grammar_point: しかし (but・however)
  - term: もの・もん
    meaning: because, since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Also casual, and used to provide a reason, but だって can also introduce a counter-argument,
      and often carries a stronger, more emphatic tone.
    grammar_point: もの・もん (because・since)
  - term: だって (even・also)
    meaning: even; also; too
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This is a homograph; it's the same word but functions as an inclusive particle. It means 'even'
      or 'too,' emphasizing that something applies to an unexpected item or person (e.g., 子供だってできる - Even
      a child can do it), whereas だって (but, however) introduces a contrasting statement or justification.
    grammar_point: だって (even・also)
post_false_friends_writeup: While だって can mean "but" or "because," it's crucial to distinguish it from
  other similar expressions. Formal conjunctions like しかし or けれど lack the casual, often emotional or defensive
  nuance of だって. もの or もん (often shortened from ものだ) also provide reasons in casual speech, but だって carries
  a stronger sense of "I mean, it's because..." or "but..." with a slightly more emphatic or argumentative
  tone. The most important distinction is between だって (but, however) and its homograph だって (even・also).
  The latter functions as an inclusive particle meaning "even" or "too," and it's essential to rely on
  context to determine which meaning is intended.
