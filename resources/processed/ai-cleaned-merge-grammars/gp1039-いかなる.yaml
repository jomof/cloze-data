    "etymology": "The word いかなる is derived from 如何 (ika, \"how\") and なる (naru), where なる comes from the classical auxiliary verb なり (nari) meaning \"to be.\"",
    "writeup": "いかなる is a formal expression similar to どんな, meaning \"what kind of\" or \"no matter what kind of.\" It is primarily used in formal writing and speech.  Unlike どんな, いかなる is classified as attributive, meaning it directly modifies a noun. When used with a negative statement, it conveys the meaning of \"no matter how much\" or \"no matter what kind of.\"  While less common, いかなる can also appear as いかな.",
