    "etymology": "The word いかなる is derived from 如何 (ika), which means \"how\" and is never used alone with this reading, combined with なる (naru). なる itself originates from the classical auxiliary verb なり (nari), meaning \"to be.\"",
    "writeup": "「いかなる」 (ikanaru) is a formal expression equivalent to the modern 「どんな」 (donna) or 「どのような」 (dono yō na), conveying meanings like \"what kind of\" or \"no matter what kind of situation.\" It is primarily used in written language and formal speeches, rarely appearing in daily conversation. Its strong, somewhat stiff tone effectively conveys solemnity, universality, or emphasis in contexts requiring such nuances.\n\nThis expression always functions as an attributive (連体詞 - rentai-shi), modifying a noun directly. For example, 「いかなる理由」 (ikanaru riyū) means \"no matter what the reason,\" and 「いかなる時も」 (ikanaru toki mo) means \"at any time.\"\n\nWhen followed by 「～も」 (e.g., 「いかなるAも～ない」), it often carries a negative implication, strongly expressing \"not any A\" or \"no A whatsoever.\" However, unlike 「どんなに」 (donnani), 「いかなる」 does not directly take 「に」 (ni) after it; instead, particles like 「に」 or others appear after the noun that 「いかなる」 modifies.\n\nOccasionally, the form 「いかな」 (ikana) may be used, but this is far less common.\n\n**Etymological Note:** The word 「いかなる」 is a combination of 如何 (ika), which means \"how\" and is never used alone with this reading, and なる (naru). 「なる」 itself derives from the classical auxiliary verb なり (nari), meaning \"to be.\" Many modern Japanese expressions, such as the adjectival noun particle 「な」 (na) and the hypothetical form 「なら」 (nara), are also derived from 「なり」. The retention of the 「なる」 form in 「いかなる」 can impart a literary or poetic resonance, enhancing its formality and impact.",
