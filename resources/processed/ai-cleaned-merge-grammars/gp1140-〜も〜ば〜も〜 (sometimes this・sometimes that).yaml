details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  function: To present typical examples of actions, events, situations, people, or things among a number
    of possibilities. It emphasizes the existence of both extremes or various instances within a range.
  nuance: Indicates a range of possibilities or experiences, implying that both situations mentioned are
    possible or likely to occur. It suggests a comprehensive representation of phenomena.
  grammatical-role: This pattern functions as a conjunction or an adverbial phrase, connecting two contrasting
    or alternating situations, actions, or states.
  logical-flow: Presents a logical flow of two co-occurring or alternating conditions/outcomes, implying
    that one leads to or exists alongside the other within a given context.
  temporal-flow: Suggests an alternating or concurrent temporal flow where different states or events
    occur at different times or simultaneously, showing variability over time.
etymology: The structure combines the particle 「も」 (also, even) with the conditional 「ば」 form of a verb,
  which denotes a condition or cause. The repetition of 「も」 highlights that both listed possibilities
  or states are equally valid or occur within a given context. The phrase essentially asserts the existence
  or occurrence of 'this' (V1) and 'that' (V2), implying a variability or range of states or actions.
  Historically, the conditional 'ば' form evolved from 'は' combined with the indicative form, indicating
  a condition or consequence. The addition of 'も' before each clause emphasizes that each condition is
  equally viable or present.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「Noun+も+Verb[ば-conditional]+Noun+も+Verb」, more broadly represented as 「〜も Vば 〜も V」, is used to express that there are times when one thing happens, and other times when something else happens. This structure effectively presents a range of possibilities, typical examples, or alternating situations.

  It is commonly employed in formal writing and speech, including academic texts, business contexts, and general observations where a comprehensive and balanced perspective is desired. Unlike simply listing possibilities, this pattern emphasizes that both (or all) mentioned conditions or outcomes are part of the overall experience or phenomenon. It implies a sense of 'sometimes this, and sometimes that' or 'there exist both this and that' within a given scope.

  While the grammar point title specifically mentions 'Noun', the pattern is highly versatile and can apply to various linguistic elements preceding 「も」, including nominalized clauses, verb stems, and adjective forms, as detailed in the 'Formation' section. This flexibility allows for its application in diverse contexts to describe the fluctuating nature of events, characteristics, or states. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to highlight the duality or the full spectrum of a situation.
false_friends:
  - term: たり〜たりする (do things like x and y)
    meaning: to do things like ~ and ~; sometimes ~ sometimes ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「〜も〜ば〜も〜」, 「〜たり〜たりする」 implies a non-exhaustive list of actions or states, often suggesting
      a casual enumeration of typical behaviors or occurrences. It focuses on the alternation of actions
      rather than the comprehensive existence of possibilities or extremes, and it can sometimes imply
      a certain randomness or lack of purpose.
    grammar_point: たり〜たりする (do things like x and y)
  - term: も~も (both neither ~ nor)
    meaning: both ~ and ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜も〜も〜」 simply lists items or concepts as being true or present together (e.g., コーヒーも紅茶も好き
      - I like both coffee and tea), 「〜も〜ば〜も〜」 specifically highlights variability, contrast, or the range
      of situations where both listed possibilities or states can exist or occur. It implies a conditional
      or alternating nature, showing a broader spectrum of possibilities.
    grammar_point: も~も (both neither ~ nor)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「〜たり〜たりする」 and 「〜も〜も〜」 share some semantic overlap with 「〜も〜ば〜も〜」, their
  nuances differ. 「〜も〜ば〜も〜」 distinctly emphasizes the *coexistence* or *alternation* of different states
  or events within a given context, often presenting a comprehensive view of a phenomenon. This contrasts
  with 「〜たり〜たりする」, which simply lists non-exhaustive examples of actions, and 「〜も〜も〜」, which just denotes
  inclusion without the conditional or alternating aspect.

      - competing_japanese:
          - うち の 部長 は 機嫌 が 良かっ {たり}、悪かっ {たり する} から 気 を つけ て。
        english: Our manager is sometimes in a good mood, and sometimes in a bad mood, so be careful.
        hint: The `〜たり〜たりする` pattern emphasizes the intermittent change in mood. This grammar point focuses
          on the *existence* of both moods as part of their character.
    scene: A senior colleague advising a new team member about their manager's temperament.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: conditional (～ば)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The observation 「機嫌 が 良い 時 も {あれば} 、 少し 怒って いる 時 も {ある}」 provides a practical warning about
      the manager's unpredictable mood. The concluding 「気 を つける 必要 が ある よ」 is a direct yet casual advisory
      tone often adopted by senior male colleagues when guiding junior male team members in a professional
      setting.
  - english: This project has easy parts, but also difficult parts.
    japanese:
      - この プロジェクト は、簡単 な 部分 も {あれ ば}、難しい 部分 も {ある}。
      - この プロジェクト に は、簡単 な 部分 も {あれ ば}、難しい 部分 も {ある}。
      - この プロジェクト、簡単 な 部分 も {あれ ば}、難しい 部分 も {ある} よ ね。
    english_literally: Regarding this project, there are easy parts, and difficult parts also exist.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この プロジェクト は 簡単 な 部分 {も}、難しい 部分 {も} ある。
        english: This project has both easy parts and difficult parts.
        hint: This simply lists two types of parts. It does not convey the dynamic sense of 'sometimes
          this, sometimes that' or a comprehensive range of characteristics as clearly as the intended
          grammar.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この プロジェクト は 簡単 な 部分 {も ある し}、難しい 部分 {も ある}。
        english: This project has easy parts, and it also has difficult parts.
        hint: The `〜し` conjunction lists reasons or facts. While similar in meaning, it lacks the specific
          'range of possibilities' emphasis of the intended grammar.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この プロジェクト は 簡単 だっ{たり}、難しかっ {たり する}。
        english: This project is sometimes easy, sometimes difficult.
        hint: The `〜たり〜たりする` pattern suggests an alternation of characteristics or actions. This grammar
          point implies the *coexistence* of both types of parts as inherent to the project.
    scene: A team leader explaining the scope of a new project to their team.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: conditional (～ば)
    nuance: The phrase 「簡単な 部分 も {あれば} 、 難しい 部分 も {ある}」 effectively communicates the dual nature of the
      project. This is a common way to manage expectations in a professional setting, highlighting that
      both positive and challenging aspects are present and to be expected.
post_example_writeup: It's important to note that the nouns connected by 「も」 can represent a wide range
  of concepts, from concrete objects to abstract ideas or even people. This grammatical pattern allows
  for a nuanced description of variability and the coexistence of different states or actions.
