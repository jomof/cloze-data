    "writeup": "The grammar point 「行く・いく」, when used as an auxiliary verb after the te-form of another verb, indicates the **continuation of an action or a change in state over time**. The point in time from which the action or change is observed can be either the present or the past. It's similar to saying \"go on doing\" or \"continue to be\" in English. This grammar point emphasizes the ongoing nature of the action or the gradual change that is taking place. For example, 「これから暖かくなって行きます」means \"It will get warmer from now on (and continue to be that way).\"",
    "etymology": "「行く(iku)」 originally means \"to go\". However, when used as an auxiliary verb after the te-form of another verb, it takes on the meaning of continuing an action or process. This usage stems from the idea of something \"going forward\" or \"proceeding\" in time.",
