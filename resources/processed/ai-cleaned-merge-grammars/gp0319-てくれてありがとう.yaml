    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of 「て」 form of the verb, 「くれる」 (to give), and 「ありがとう」 (thank you). It literally translates to \"thank you for giving (me) the action of doing something.\"",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「てくれてありがとう」, expresses gratitude for someone doing something specifically for you. It combines the 「て」 form of a verb with 「くれる」 (to give) and 「ありがとう」 (thank you). While it is common to thank people for their actions, this expression is most appropriate when acknowledging a favor or a kindness that goes beyond routine expectations. Therefore, using this grammar point to thank someone for fulfilling ordinary duties or simple acts of etiquette might sound unnatural or even sarcastic. It is most suitable when the action genuinely benefits the speaker.",
