        "Related Expressions": "とも, ても"
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「ども」is derived from the classical Japanese conjunction 「と雖も (いえども)」, which combines 「と」 (a quotative particle) and 「雖も (いえども)」 (meaning \"even though\"). Over time, it evolved into the shorter form 「ども」, retaining its concessive meaning.",
    "writeup": "「ども」 is a conjunction used to express concession or contrast, similar to \"even though\" or \"although\" in English. It is typically used in more formal writing and speech. The basic structure involves attaching 「ども」 to the conditional form of a verb or the stem of an adjective. This particle indicates that despite a certain condition, the expected result does not occur.\n\nIt's essential to remember that 「ども」 often carries a sense of surprise or unexpectedness, highlighting the contrast between the stated condition and the actual outcome. It is generally used in more formal contexts.",
