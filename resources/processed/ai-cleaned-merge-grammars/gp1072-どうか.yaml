    "writeup": "どうか (dōka) is an adverb that intensifies a request, adding a layer of politeness and earnestness. It's stronger than a simple ください (kudasai) and conveys a deep sense of pleading or urgency. Think of it as the \"please\" you use when you really, *really* need something. It's often used when asking for a significant favor or in a desperate situation. It can also be used to express a sincere wish or hope.",
    "etymology": "The etymology of どうか is somewhat uncertain, but it is thought to have evolved from どう (dō), meaning \"how\" or \"in what way,\" combined with the particle か (ka). Over time, it acquired the meaning of \"in some way, please\" or \"by any means, please,\" eventually solidifying into its current usage as an intensifier for requests.",
