  part-of-speech: noun
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: Used to connect two contrasting or opposing features of a single subject (person, thing,
    or situation). It highlights a duality, typically presenting a positive aspect alongside a negative
    one, or vice-versa. It cannot be used to describe two positive or two negative aspects.
  function: Functions as a noun to introduce a contrasting aspect or characteristic of the same subject
    or situation.
  nuance: Implies a strong contradiction or trade-off where the positive aspect inherently leads to or
    exists alongside a negative aspect, or vice-versa. It emphasizes that these are two sides of the same
    coin, often with an underlying sense of bittersweetness or inherent challenge. It specifically implies
    a contradiction or trade-off, differentiating it from expressions that simply present another side.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a connective that introduces a contrasting clause or phrase.
etymology: The word 「反面 (hanmen)」 literally translates to "opposite side" or "reverse aspect." It is composed
  of the kanji 「反 (han)」, meaning "opposite" or "reverse," and 「面 (men)」, meaning "side" or "aspect."
  This direct, literal meaning is reflected in its grammatical function, where it serves to highlight
  the contrasting or contradictory aspects of a single entity or situation. Its usage evolved to concisely
  express the duality inherent in many concepts or phenomena, emphasizing the two differing 'faces' of
  the same subject.
writeup: |-
  「反面 (hanmen)」 is a grammatical construction used to present two contrasting or opposing features of a single person, thing, or situation. It frequently translates to "while," "on the other hand," or "although." The core function of 「反面」 is to highlight a duality, typically presenting a positive aspect alongside a negative one, or vice-versa. It is crucial to understand that 「反面」 is specifically used for expressing contradictions and is not suitable for describing two exclusively positive or two exclusively negative aspects of the same subject; it implies a trade-off or an inherent opposition.

  As a noun, 「反面」 connects to various word types:
  *   **Verbs** (in their plain non-past form): For example, 「する反面 (suru hanmen - while doing)」, 「できない反面 (dekinai hanmen - while unable to do)」.
  *   **い-adjectives** (in their plain non-past form): For example, 「高い反面 (takai hanmen - while expensive)」, 「美味しくない反面 (oishikunai hanmen - while not delicious)」.
  *   **な-adjectives** (followed by 「な」 or 「である」): For example, 「便利な反面 (benri na hanmen - while convenient)」 for casual contexts, or 「便利である反面 (benri de aru hanmen - while convenient)」 for more formal or explanatory situations.
  *   **Nouns** (followed by 「である」): For example, 「学生である反面 (gakusei de aru hanmen - while being a student)」.

  This structure enables a nuanced expression of complex realities where benefits often come with drawbacks, or positive traits are accompanied by negative ones within the same subject. It emphasizes that these contrasting elements are inherent to the same entity, creating a sense of balance in the observation.

  - term: に対して
    meaning: In contrast to, While, In regard to, Whereas
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に対して」 is typically used to compare two *different* entities or subjects, or to express an
      opposing action or feeling towards something. It emphasizes contrast between distinct elements rather
      than opposing aspects within a single one, which is the core function of 「反面」.
    grammar_point: に対して (towards; in contrast)
  - term: 一方で
    meaning: On the other hand, At the same time, While
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「一方で」 can indicate contrasting or simultaneous aspects, but it is broader than 「反面」. It can
      introduce another aspect or viewpoint without necessarily implying a strong contradiction or a negative
      consequence directly stemming from a positive attribute. While it can show contrast, it doesn't
      always carry the same emphasis on inherent opposition within *one* subject as 「反面」 does.
    grammar_point: 一方で (on the other hand・while)
  - term: ながらも
    meaning: Even though, despite
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ながらも」 indicates concession, meaning "even while doing X, Y occurs," or "despite X, Y." While
      it can express contrasting aspects, it doesn't necessarily imply the inherent, often problematic,
      duality of two opposing characteristics within the *same subject* as strongly as 「反面」 does. 「ながらも」
      often focuses on an action or state continuing despite a condition, or a surprising outcome given
      a certain condition.
    grammar_point: ながら (although・despite)
  - term: ものの
    meaning: Although, but, even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ものの」 is a more formal and literary expression for "although" or "even though." It expresses
      a concession, where a statement is true but there's a contrasting or unexpected subsequent fact.
      Like 「反面」, it can highlight duality. However, `ものの` often simply introduces a contrasting fact without
      necessarily implying the inherent, two-sided nature of *one* subject that 「反面」 emphasizes (e.g.,
      A is true, *but* B is also true, where B might not be an inherent *opposite* of A, just another
      fact).
    grammar_point: ものの (although・but)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  When distinguishing between 「反面」, 「に対して」, 「一方で」, 「ながらも」, and 「ものの」, consider the nature and focus of the contrast.
  *   Use 「反面」 to highlight two *inherently opposing or contradictory characteristics* that belong to the *same single subject or situation*. It emphasizes a direct trade-off or duality. For instance, a job might be challenging but also highly rewarding.
  *   Use 「に対して」 when comparing or contrasting *two different entities, ideas, or groups*. It points out differences between distinct items. For example, comparing city life to rural life, or someone's attitude towards another.
  *   Use 「一方で」 for presenting *another side* or a *simultaneous aspect*. It is broader than 「反面」 and can introduce a contrasting or additional fact without necessarily implying an inherent, strong contradiction within a single subject. It often means "on the other hand" or "at the same time."
  *   Use 「ながらも」 to express concession, meaning "even while doing X, Y occurs," or "despite X, Y." It focuses on an action or state continuing despite a condition or a surprising outcome given a certain condition. While it can show contrasting aspects, it less strongly implies the fundamental, inherent duality within a single subject that 「反面」 highlights.
  *   Use 「ものの」 as a more formal way to say "although" or "even though." It introduces a conceded fact followed by a contrasting or unexpected subsequent fact. Similar to 「ながらも」, it expresses a concession but might not carry the specific emphasis on the internal, two-sided conflict of one subject that 「反面」 does.

      of technology. 'Camera' (カメラ) is also a loanword.

          that highlights the dual nature of city living.
    scene: A young woman reflecting on her experiences living in a big city with a close friend.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The casual nature of the conversation between two female friends is reflected in the use of
      「な反面」, which is commonly used in everyday speech to express contrasting points about a single subject.

      with 「な反面」 highlights the duality inherent in city life.

      with traditional crafts. It conveys that the beauty and the difficulty are two inherent and contrasting
      aspects of the craft itself, suitable for an expert presentation by a female speaker to a group.

    etymology: The term 'traditional crafts' (伝統 工芸) represents a significant part of Japanese cultural
      heritage, often associated with a long history of meticulous development and preservation.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「反面」 is used to describe two opposing attributes or
  outcomes related to the *same subject*. It effectively conveys a balanced, often bittersweet, perspective
  by highlighting the inherent contradictions within a single entity or situation. This structure is particularly
  useful when discussing the trade-offs or dual nature of concepts, objects, or experiences.
