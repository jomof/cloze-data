jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: casual
  function: Expresses a hypothetical situation and its predictable outcome, similar to 「ても」 but more casual.
  grammatical-role: Conjunctive particle
  logical-flow: Concessive (result occurs regardless of condition)
  temporal-flow: hypothetical
etymology: 「(っ)たって」 is an informal contraction of 「〜ても」, which combines the past tense auxiliary verb
  「た」 with the conjunctive particle 「って」, a colloquial form of 「ても」. The additional 「っ」 can add emphasis
  or be omitted depending on the speaker's preference.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「(っ)たって」 is a colloquial equivalent of 「ても」, expressing "even if," "even though," or "no matter how." It's primarily used in casual conversation to emphasize that a particular result will occur irrespective of the condition being stated. This structure is commonly used to dismiss a condition as irrelevant to the final outcome, indicating a sense of resignation or inevitability. It is not typically used in formal writing or speech.

  「(っ)たって」 can be attached to various word types: verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. Its usage extends to both affirmative and negative hypothetical conditions, making it a versatile informal expression. The optional small 「っ」, which indicates a glottal stop or doubled consonant sound, can add emphasis, but its omission does not change the meaning.
false_friends:
  - term: ても
    meaning: even if; even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「(っ)たって」 is an informal version of 「ても」, primarily used in casual speech. 「ても」 is a more versatile,
      standard form that can be used in both formal and informal contexts.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: たところで
    meaning: even if (it happens), it's useless/futile
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both imply a condition, 「たところで」 specifically emphasizes the futility or ineffectiveness
      of the action or state, suggesting that the result will not change. 「(っ)たって」 is a more neutral concessive,
      simply stating the outcome regardless of the condition.
    grammar_point: たところで (even if futile)
  - term: たとえ〜ても
    meaning: even if
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たとえ〜ても」 explicitly sets up a strong hypothetical situation, often with a sense of "even if
      it were to happen." It's more formal and emphasizes the hypothetical nature more strongly than the
      casual 「(っ)たって」, which directly states the concession.
    grammar_point: たとえ〜ても (even if)
  - term: ようと・が
    meaning: no matter, even if
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようと・が」 is a more emphatic and often stronger way to say "no matter how/what/who" compared
      to 「(っ)たって」. It tends to be more formal or literary, highlighting that something holds true irrespective
      of the preceding condition, with a sense of inevitability or disregard for the condition.
    grammar_point: ようと・が (no matter・even if)
  - term: にもかかわらず
    meaning: despite
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にもかかわらず」 conveys "despite" or "in spite of," often indicating that something happened contrary
      to expectation given the preceding condition. While 「(っ)たって」 also expresses a kind of "even if,"
      「にもかかわらず」 places more emphasis on the unexpected or contradictory nature of the outcome. It is also
      a more formal expression.
    grammar_point: にもかかわらず (despite)
  - term: とはいえ
    meaning: though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「(っ)たって」 and 「とはいえ」 express concession, 「とはいえ」 often acknowledges a preceding statement
      as true before introducing a qualification or contrasting idea, meaning "though that may be true."
      「(っ)たって」 more directly states a hypothetical condition and its inevitable outcome. 「とはいえ」 is also
      more formal.
    grammar_point: とはいえ (though)
  - term: ども
    meaning: even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ども」 is a very formal and literary conjunction equivalent to 「けれども」 or 「ても」. It expresses
      concession or contrast, "even though" or "although." Unlike the casual 「(っ)たって」, 「ども」 is rarely
      used in spoken Japanese and signals a highly formal or written context.
    grammar_point: ども (even though)
  - term: としても
    meaning: even if assumed
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 「(っ)たって」 and 「としても」 express "even if." However, 「としても」 often implies a hypothetical assumption,
      "even if we assume X is true," or dismisses the relevance of a potential fact. 「(っ)たって」 is a more
      casual and direct way to state that the outcome is unaffected by the condition, without necessarily
      implying an 'assumption'.
    grammar_point: としても (even if assumed)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「(っ)たって」 and its counterparts like 「ても」, 「たとえ〜ても」, 「としても」, 「とはいえ」, 「ども」,
  「ようと・が」, and 「にもかかわらず」 all convey 'even if' or 'despite,' their primary distinctions lie in formality,
  nuance, and specific emphasis. 「(っ)たって」 is exclusively for casual contexts, whereas 「ても」 is more versatile
  across registers. 「たとえ〜ても」 and 「としても」 emphasize a stronger hypothetical or assumed condition. More formal
  options like 「とはいえ」 and 「ども」 are often used in written or highly polite contexts, with 「とはいえ」 acknowledging
  a truth before qualification, and 「ども」 simply meaning 'even though'. 「たところで」 carries a distinct nuance
  of futility, implying that an action will make no difference to the outcome, which is not inherent in
  「(っ)たって」. Lastly, expressions like 「ようと・が」 and 「にもかかわらず」 denote a stronger, more definite disregard
  for the preceding condition or highlight an unexpected outcome, respectively. Understanding these subtle
  differences in tone and implication is key to choosing the most appropriate expression.

          pointless).
        hint: 「たところで」 suggests the action is pointless or doesn't change the outcome, while 「(っ)たって」 states
          the condition without implying futility. We're looking for a simple statement of intent regardless
          of the condition.

    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The 「よ」 at the end adds a casual, slightly assertive or confirming tone. This is common in
      friendly conversation, especially among females. The 「の」 in the second Japanese option is also common
      in female speech, softening the assertion slightly. The 「しね」 in the third option adds a nuanced
      sense of 'and besides' or 'you know', implying a casual reason.

        english: No matter how tough it was, I won't give up until the end (it having been tough was futile).
        hint: 「たところで」 implies the futility of the tough situation, while 「(っ)たって」 states commitment despite
          the difficulty. We're looking for strong determination regardless of the current state.
    scene: An athlete is pushing through an incredibly difficult training session, determined to overcome
      the challenge.
    register: casual

          made no difference).
        hint: 「たところで」 highlights that the condition (being uninteresting) is futile or irrelevant, while
          「(っ)たって」 simply states the necessity despite the condition. We're looking for an explanation
          of obligation despite the quality.

      conviction in a semi-formal, motivational context. In the third option, 「何が何でも」 strongly emphasizes

        hint: 「たところで」 implies that the condition (not being a professional) is irrelevant or makes no
          difference to the outcome, while 「(っ)たって」 states that enjoyment is possible regardless of skill
          level. We're looking for encouragement that enjoyment is possible even without professional

        english: Even if it was just a game, I'll take it seriously (it being a game was futile).
        hint: 「たところで」 implies that the game would be pointless anyway, which contradicts the speaker's
          serious intent. We're expressing seriousness despite the game's trivial nature.

        english: Even if I tried, I probably couldn't change anything now.

        english: Even if I tried, I probably couldn't change anything now (trying now would be futile).
        hint: While 「たところで」 expresses futility, 「(っ)たって」 here focuses more on the simple conditional 'even
          if I tried' leading to an unchanged outcome, rather than emphasizing the act itself as futile.
          The meaning is very close, but 「(っ)たって」 is more general and casual.
    scene: Someone reflecting on a past decision or situation, realizing it's too late to alter the outcome.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The particle 「な」 at the end of 「だろうな」 adds a sense of resignation or self-reflection, often
      used by male speakers or in neutral, introspective contexts. It indicates a conclusion drawn by
      the speaker, often to themselves.
post_example_writeup: As illustrated by the examples, 「(っ)たって」 is a highly flexible expression. It conveys
  a strong sense of inevitability or dismissal of a condition, regardless of whether the condition itself
  is affirmative or negative. It is typically used in casual speech and often carries a nuanced tone of
  resignation or strong assertion depending on context.
