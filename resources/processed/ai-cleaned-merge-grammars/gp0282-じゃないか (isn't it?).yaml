grammar_point: じゃないか (isn't it?)
learn_before:
  - あり (possibility・with)
id: gp0282
meaning: Isn't it?, Is it not?
pronunciation:
  katakana: ジャナイカ
  romaji: janai ka
formation:
  '[Phrase] + じゃないか': Indicates a question or a suggestion with a degree of casualness. Similar to asking
    "isn't it?" in English.
jlpt: N4
etymology: じゃないか is derived from the negative form of the copula だ (ja nai) followed by the question particle
  か (ka). The copula だ indicates affirmation or identification, its negative form ではない (or its casual
  contraction じゃない) means "is not." Adding か turns this into a question, giving it the nuance of seeking
  agreement or making a rhetorical observation.
writeup: The expression じゃないか, often translated as "Isn't it?" or "Right?", is a versatile phrase used
  in casual Japanese. It combines the negative form of the copula, じゃない (casual contraction of ではない),
  with the interrogative particle か. While literally meaning "is not?", its function extends beyond a
  simple negative question. It is primarily used to seek confirmation, express a suggestion, or pose a
  rhetorical question, often implying that the speaker believes the listener will agree or already knows
  the fact. When used with a slightly rising intonation, it asks for agreement. With a falling intonation,
  it can express a strong assertion, an observation, or even a mild admonition. For a more formal or polite
  tone, ではないか is used. However, ではないか can sound somewhat stiff or academic, making it more suitable for
  formal discussions, presentations, or written contexts.

      not inherently carry the interrogative nuance of じゃないか unless followed by an implied or actual か.

  - term: ね (seeking agreement)
    meaning: Isn't it?, Right? (Sentence ending particle)

      じゃないか can convey more of the speaker's conviction.
    grammar_point: ね (seeking agreement)
  - term: のではないだろうか (indirect suggestion)
    meaning: I think ... isn't it?, It might be that..., Don't you agree?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: のではないだろうか (indirect suggestion) expresses a more hesitant or thoughtful suggestion or speculation.
      It implies a degree of uncertainty and encourages the listener to consider the possibility, rather
      than seeking direct confirmation of a shared understanding.
    grammar_point: のではないだろうか (indirect suggestion)
  - term: かもしれない (might)
    meaning: Might, Maybe, Probably
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: かもしれない (might) expresses a possibility. It doesn't invite confirmation in the same way じゃないか
      does; it simply states that something might be the case without implying the speaker's strong belief.
    grammar_point: かもしれない (might・maybe)
  - term: のだろうか (I wonder)
    meaning: I wonder...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: のだろうか (I wonder) expresses a sense of wondering or doubt. It's a more introspective question
      than じゃないか, which is often used to seek external confirmation or assert a shared reality.
    grammar_point: のだろうか (I wonder)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share some overlapping functions with じゃないか, understanding
  their specific nuances helps in choosing the most appropriate one. じゃないか often carries a sense of the
  speaker's conviction or expectation, asking for agreement or asserting a perceived truth. Other particles
  like ね or formal expressions like でしょう achieve similar functions but with different levels of politeness,
  certainty, or speaker's involvement.

  - english: Isn't Kiyoko coming soon?
    japanese:
      - キヨコ は もう すぐ 来る {じゃ ない か}。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - キヨコ は もう すぐ 来 ます {か}。
        english: Is Kiyoko coming soon?
        hint: 「ですか」is a neutral way to ask a question. じゃないか implies you already have an expectation or
          belief. We're looking for a phrase that seeks confirmation based on an existing expectation.
    scene: Asking for confirmation about someone's arrival.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This usage seeks confirmation, implying the speaker has an expectation that Kiyoko will arrive
      soon. The rising intonation makes it a question. The phrase 「来るじゃないか」implies a prior belief or observation,
      making the question less neutral than a simple 「来ますか」. Often used by female speakers to express
      a softer, more inquisitive tone, but not exclusively.

          agreement.
    scene: Commenting on the price of an item.
    register: casual
    setting: informative

      the camera is expensive and is inviting the listener to concur. The neutral tone here could be used

      rhetorical usage is common in academic or professional discussions, often by speakers in positions
      of authority or delivering a presentation.

      a mildly scolding or advising tone, implying that the suggested action is the obvious and correct
      one. The addition of 「ん」before じゃないか often adds an explanatory or emphatic nuance. This kind of
      gentle but firm persuasion is a common communication style among female friends or family members.

    register: casual
    setting: professional
    nuance: The term 「お前」 (omae) is predominantly used by male speakers, particularly when speaking to
      male peers or subordinates in a casual or familiar, sometimes admonishing, context. The directness
      of the question and its slight admonishing tone, conveyed through the falling intonation of 「じゃないか」,
      are also common in masculine communication styles, especially from a superior to a subordinate.
      This implies a gentle but firm push to return to duty.
post_example_writeup: As seen in these examples, じゃないか can convey various nuances depending on context
  and intonation. A rising intonation typically seeks confirmation or agreement, while a falling intonation
  can imply an assertion or a gentle admonition. The inclusion of ん before じゃないか (as んじゃないか) often adds
  an explanatory or emphatic nuance, highlighting the reason or the speaker's personal feeling about the
  statement. Observing how じゃないか is used in different scenarios helps to grasp its flexibility and the
  subtle meanings it can convey.
