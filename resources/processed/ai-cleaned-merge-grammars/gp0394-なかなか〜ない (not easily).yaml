details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express a sense of frustration or unmet expectation regarding something that
    is not happening or is not progressing as desired or anticipated.
  function: Modifies a negative verb or adjective to emphasize difficulty, slowness, or an unexpected
    lack of progress.
  nuance: Implies that the speaker expects a different, more positive outcome, and the current state causes
    a feeling of mild frustration or impatience. It is stronger than 'あまり〜ない' (not very) but less absolute
    than '全く〜ない' (not at all). It often suggests an internal obstacle or persistence required.
  grammatical-role: Adverbial modifier
etymology: The word 「なかなか」 (中々) literally means 'in the middle' or 'amidst'. When used with a negative
  verb, it colloquially evolved to convey a sense that something isn't reaching its expected or desired
  'middle ground' or optimal state, thereby expressing difficulty, resistance, or a prolonged state of
  not achieving something. This historical nuance lends itself to the feeling of unmet expectation or
  frustration that accompanies its use.
writeup: |-
  「なかなか〜ない」 is a common Japanese expression used to convey that something is **not easily** achieved, is **hardly** happening, or is **far from** reaching an expected state. It implies a sense of difficulty, resistance, or a prolonged period without the desired outcome. Unlike a simple negation, it carries a nuance of the speaker's expectation being unmet, often leading to a feeling of mild frustration or impatience. This expression is versatile and can be applied to actions, states, or processes.

  ### Usage

  「なかなか」 is typically placed directly before the negative form of a verb or an い-adjective. For example, in 「なかなか できない」 (It's not easily done), the frustration arises because one expects it *should* be done, but it isn't.

  While 「なかなか」 can also be used in a positive sense to mean "very" or "quite" (e.g., 「なかなか 面白い」 - It's quite interesting), its usage with negation is distinctly different, highlighting the difficulty or lack of progress. The context always clarifies which meaning is intended.

  It is generally used in standard or casual speech, reflecting a personal observation or complaint about a persistent situation.
false_friends:
  - term: なかなか
    meaning: Very, Quite, Considerably
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「なかなか〜ない」, 「なかなか」 used alone has a positive meaning, indicating something is quite
      good or impressive. The meaning shifts drastically when combined with a negative verb.
    grammar_point: なかなか (quite not easily)
  - term: 全然〜ない
    meaning: Not at all
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both express negation, 「全然〜ない」 emphasizes a complete absence or negation of something,
      whereas 「なかなか〜ない」 implies difficulty or a slow progression despite effort, rather than a total lack.
    grammar_point: 全然 (not at all; totally)
  - term: 少しも〜ない
    meaning: Not even a little, Not at all
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「全然〜ない」, 「少しも〜ない」 indicates that there's not even a small degree of something,
      emphasizing completeness of negation. 「なかなか〜ない」, conversely, focuses on the struggle or difficulty
      of achieving something.
    grammar_point: すこしも〜ない (not even a little)
  - term: あまり〜ない
    meaning: Not very, Not much, Hardly
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「あまり〜ない」 suggests a lesser degree or frequency and is a weaker negation. 「なかなか〜ない」 implies
      more frustration or resistance to achieving a desired state, often despite efforts.
    grammar_point: あまり ない (not very or much)
  - term: 別に〜ない
    meaning: Not really, Not particularly
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「別に〜ない」 indicates a lack of particular interest, relevance, or strong feeling, often used
      dismissively or casually. It doesn't convey the same sense of difficulty or unmet expectation as
      「なかなか〜ない」.
    grammar_point: 別に〜ない (not particularly)
  - term: めったに〜ない
    meaning: Hardly, Rarely, Seldom
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「めったに〜ない」 focuses specifically on the infrequency of an event. While it implies that something
      doesn't happen easily due to rarity, it doesn't necessarily carry the same nuance of personal effort,
      expectation, or frustration that 「なかなか〜ない」 does regarding a continuous state or process.
    grammar_point: めったに〜ない (rarely)
post_false_friends_writeup: While several expressions convey negativity, 「なかなか〜ない」 is distinct in its
  emphasis on difficulty and unmet expectation. It's not merely stating that something isn't happening;
  it's highlighting that despite implicit or explicit effort, or a reasonable expectation, the desired
  outcome is not materializing easily. This subtle but important distinction helps convey a deeper layer
  of meaning in Japanese conversation, reflecting the speaker's emotional state or observation about a
  protracted situation.

  - english: Recently, my Japanese studies aren't progressing easily.
    japanese:
      - 最近、日本 語 の 勉強 が {なかなか 進ま ない} です。
      - 最近、日本 語 の 勉強 が {なかなか 進み ませ ん}。
      - 最近、日本 語 の 勉強 が {なかなか 進ま ない}。

          - 最近、日本 語 の 勉強 が {全然 進ま ない} です。
        english: Recently, my Japanese studies aren't progressing at all.
        hint: 「全然〜ない」 implies a complete lack of progress, but your studies are just difficult to progress.
          We're looking for an expression that means 'not easily'.
    scene: A student is feeling stuck and discusses their challenges with a study buddy.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
  - english: It's past the promised time, but my friend isn't coming at all.
    japanese:
      - 約束 の 時間 に なっ た けど、友達 が {なかなか 来 ない} ね。
      - 約束 の 時間 に なっ た けど、友達 が {なかなか 来 ませ ん} ね。
      - 約束 の 時間 に なっ た けど、友達 が {なかなか 来 ない}。
    english_literally: Promise time became, but friend not easily come, huh.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 約束 の 時間 に なっ た けど、友達 が {まだ 来 て ない} ね。
        english: It's past the promised time, but my friend still hasn't come.
        hint: 「まだ〜てない」 simply states that something hasn't happened yet. 「なかなか〜ない」 implies frustration
          because someone *should* have arrived by now. We're looking for a sense of unmet expectation.
    scene: Two friends are waiting for a third friend who is late for a meeting.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「〜ね」 softens the statement, making it a shared observation rather than a direct
      complaint. The speaker's female gender doesn't inherently change the verb form here, but the overall
      casual tone fits female speech patterns. Speaking to a male friend with this casualness is also
      natural for females, especially when discussing a shared slight inconvenience or observation. The
      choice of 「来ない」 vs. 「来ません」 depends on the desired level of politeness within the casual register;
      here, both are provided to show common variations in spoken Japanese.

        english: I've been trying to study, but I can't concentrate at all today.

      a touch of personal reflection and mild frustration common in female speech when expressing a difficulty
      to oneself.

        english: The party was good, but it was so formal it wasn't fun at all.
        hint: 「全然楽しくなかった」 means it was absolutely not fun. We're looking for an expression that conveys

          easily.
    scene: Someone recounting their experience at a stiff, formal party to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「〜かった よ」 at the end is common in male speech, adding a casual, slightly emphatic
      tone when sharing a personal experience or opinion with a close friend. The nuance here is about
      the *difficulty* of finding enjoyment, rather than a complete absence of it.

          prolonged struggle to forget, not necessarily total failure.
    scene: A friend confiding in another friend about their ongoing heartbreak.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「なかなか忘れられない」 expresses the persistent difficulty of moving on, common in intimate conversations

      personal frustration. It fits a professional context where one might express mild complaint to oneself
      about work progress.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「なかなか〜ない」 is a nuanced expression that goes beyond
  simple negation. It expresses a struggle, a persistent difficulty, or a sense of impatience when something
  doesn't happen as readily as expected. This subtle but important distinction helps convey a deeper layer
  of meaning in Japanese conversation, reflecting the speaker's emotional state or observation about a
  protracted situation.
