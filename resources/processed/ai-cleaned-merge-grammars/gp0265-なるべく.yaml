    "etymology": "The term 「なるべく」 comes from 成る (naru, 'to become') and 可く (beku, an archaic form meaning 'permissible'). It literally translates to 'as each opportunity becomes permissible,' suggesting doing something whenever the opportunity arises.",
    "writeup": "「なるべく」 combines 成る (naru, to become) and 可く (beku, to be permissible). It conveys the idea of doing something 'as much as possible' or 'whenever possible'. It's generally written in hiragana. Compared to 「できるだけ」, 「なるべく」 is softer and more polite because it expresses the *possibility* or *opportunity* to do something, rather than a direct statement of doing something to the fullest extent.",
