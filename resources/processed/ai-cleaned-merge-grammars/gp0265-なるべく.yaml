        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "General use",
        "function": "To indicate a preference or goal to achieve something to the greatest possible extent or whenever circumstances allow, often conveying a softer, more flexible nuance than other similar expressions.",
        "nuance": "Implies an effort to do something as much as circumstances permit, acknowledging potential limitations. It often sounds softer and more considerate than expressions like 「できるだけ」."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「なるべく」 combines 「成る (to become)」 and 「可く (to be permissible)」. The literal meaning is \"as each opportunity becomes permissible/presents itself.\" This etymological root highlights its nuance of doing something 'as possible' or 'when able', rather than an absolute maximum effort.",
    "writeup": "「なるべく」 is an adverbial expression typically written in hiragana. It conveys the meaning of **as much as possible** or **whenever possible**, implying a strong intention to achieve something to the fullest extent that circumstances allow. It's often used when giving advice, making requests, or expressing personal goals, allowing for flexibility and a softer tone.\n\nWhile often translated similarly to 「できるだけ」 (dekiru dake), 「なるべく」 carries a slightly different nuance. 「できるだけ」 emphasizes achieving a maximum quantity or degree, often suggesting a direct and absolute effort. In contrast, 「なるべく」 focuses on doing something *whenever* the opportunity arises or *as much as* is reasonably feasible, acknowledging potential constraints or making a gentler suggestion. For instance, 「なるべく」 might be used when you wish someone to do something without putting excessive pressure on them, showing consideration for their situation. It implies a continuous or consistent effort rather than a single peak effort.\n\nThis expression is highly versatile and can be used in a wide range of situations, from casual conversations to more formal settings, depending on the surrounding sentence structure and politeness level. It is generally gender-neutral and can be used by speakers of any age.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「なるべく」, 「できれば」 or 「できたら」 express a desire or condition that something might happen, rather than emphasizing the effort to make it happen. They are conditional and suggest a possibility, whereas 「なるべく」 implies an effort will be made."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「なるべく」 and 「できるだけ」 both translate to \"as much as possible,\" the former implies a softer, more flexible effort considering circumstances, often used for continuous or gentle encouragement. The latter focuses on maximizing effort or quantity. Similarly, 「できれば」 and 「できたら」 express a conditional possibility (\"if possible\") and do not carry the same nuance of effort or intention as 「なるべく」.",
