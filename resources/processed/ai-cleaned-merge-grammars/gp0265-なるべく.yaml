    "writeup": "「なるべく」, usually written in hiragana, means **as much as possible** or **whenever possible**. It expresses doing something to the best of one's ability or whenever the opportunity arises. It is softer and more polite than 「できるだけ」, which directly states something will be done to the full extent possible. 「なるべく」 expresses the *possibility* or *having the opportunity* to do something.",
