    "etymology": "The word 「なるべく」 combines 「成る(to become)」 and 「可く(to be permissible)」. The literal meaning is \"as each opportunity becomes permissible/presents itself.\"",
    "writeup": "「なるべく」, usually written in hiragana, means **as much as possible** or **whenever possible**. It expresses doing something to the best of one's ability or whenever the opportunity arises. It is softer and more polite than 「できるだけ」, which directly states something will be done to the full extent possible. 「なるべく」 expresses the *possibility* or *having the opportunity* to do something.",

                    "mitigation": "This scene emphasizes a gentle reminder about ongoing safety, suggesting a continuous effort (\"as often as possible\") rather than a purely maximal effort (`できるだけ`) that might imply a burden."

                    "competing_grammar": "必ずドアのカギをかけてください",
                    "mitigation": "This scene emphasizes a gentle reminder, whereas `必ず` (kanarazu) would imply a strict, non-negotiable command, which is not the nuance of `なるべく`."

            "listener_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "While the phrase 「〜ください」 is gender-neutral, this example sets a scene where a father uses `なるべく` to offer guidance to his daughter, emphasizing a gentle wish for safety rather than a strict command. The choice of male speaker and female listener serves to fulfill the required gender diversity in examples."

                    "mitigation": "This scene conveys a sympathetic tone. `なるべく` is softer, implying understanding of the listener's tiredness, making it suitable for a concerned wife. `できるだけ` would sound too demanding given the context of fatigue."

            "nuance": "The use of 「ください」 indicates the speaker is asking the listener to do something. The speaker, a wife, uses this polite form to be considerate of their husband. The nuance of `なるべく` here is a gentle encouragement, showing care for the husband's well-being given his fatigue. The sentence itself is not inherently gender-specific in its Japanese phrasing, but the scene is set to illustrate a common interaction between a wife and husband."
