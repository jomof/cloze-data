        "Verb (potential form) + ものなら": "Expresses a hypothetical situation that is unlikely but desired."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ものなら」 is derived from 「もの」 (thing, concept) and 「なら」 (the conditional form of 「だ」, meaning 'if it is'). It implies 'if something were the case' or 'if something were possible.' The potential form of the verb preceding it indicates the condition that is unlikely or difficult to achieve.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「ものなら」 is often used after the potential form of a verb. It expresses that while something (A) is not thought to be possible, if it were possible, then (B) would follow. Common translations include \"if (A), (B),\" \"if one could (A), (B),\" and \"if (A) were possible, (B).\" Because 「ものなら」 is a combination of 「もの」 and the hypothetical form of 「だ」 (なら), it essentially states that if (A) were a 'thing', then (B).\n\nThis structure often expresses a desired outcome in the (B) part of the sentence, frequently accompanied by 「てみる」 or 「てみたい」. Additionally, 「もし」 may appear at the beginning of the sentence to further emphasize the nuance of 'if'. 「てみる」 is often used for criticism, suggesting that if someone thinks that (A) is possible, then perhaps they should try it. 「てみたい」 is more commonly used when (A) is wished for, and the speaker would like to do it if possible.\n\nWhile not a strict rule, the verb in both the (A) and (B) parts of 「ものなら」 sentences is frequently the same, especially when expressing a desire to do (A).",
