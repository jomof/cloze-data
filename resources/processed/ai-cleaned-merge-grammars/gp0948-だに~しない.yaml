    "etymology": "The particle 「だに」 comes from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「断つ (tatsu)」, meaning 'to cut off' or 'to stop'. Its use here suggests cutting off even the slightest possibility or thought of something.",
    "writeup": "「だに～しない」 is a formal expression used to convey that something is 'not even' conceivable or imaginable. It's similar to 「さえ」 or 「すら」, but is considered more literary and stiff. It emphasizes the minimal or lower limit to which a statement applies, implying that if it's not true even for this minimum, it's definitely not true for anything greater. 「だに」 is often paired with negative structures and typically follows nouns or noun phrases. Note that 「だに」 itself is not inherently negative; when used with verbs and a non-negative phrase, it can simply mean 'just'. This expression is primarily encountered in fixed phrases in modern Japanese, such as 「夢にだに」 (even in a dream), 「想像するだに」 (even in imagination), 「考えるだに」 (even to consider), 「聞くだに」 (even hearing), and 「微動だに」 (even a quiver).",
