    "etymology": "だに is derived from the classical Japanese adverbial particle that emphasizes a minimum or lower limit. しない is the negative form of the verb する (to do). Together, they create a construction that denies something even in its smallest possible form.",
    "writeup": "だに is an adverbial particle similar in meaning to さえ and すら, meaning \"even,\" but it's more commonly found in classical literature. It's typically paired with negative structures to present a minimum example to which something doesn't apply. Think of it as saying, \"Not even *this*, so definitely not anything greater.\" It often follows nouns or noun phrases. When だに follows verbs and the phrase is not negative, it can simply mean 'just.' This reflects its core meaning of marking the preceding word or phrase as an extremely small amount or a lower limit.\n\n*   **Important Consideration:** だに is primarily used in a limited set of expressions in modern Japanese, such as: 夢にだに (even in a dream), 想像するだに (even in my imagination), 考えるだに (even to consider), 聞くだに (even hearing), 微動だに (not even a quiver).",
