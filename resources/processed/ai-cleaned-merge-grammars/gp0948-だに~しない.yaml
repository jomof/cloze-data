    "etymology": "だに is derived from the classical Japanese adverbial particle that emphasizes a minimum or lower limit. しない is the negative form of the verb する (to do). Together, they create a construction that denies something even in its smallest possible form.",
    "writeup": "だに is an adverbial particle similar in meaning to さえ and すら, meaning \"even,\" but it's more commonly found in classical literature. It's typically paired with negative structures to present a minimum example to which something doesn't apply. Think of it as saying, \"Not even *this*, so definitely not anything greater.\" It often follows nouns or noun phrases.\n\n*   **Important Consideration:** だに is primarily used in a limited set of expressions in modern Japanese, such as: 夢にだに (even in a dream), 想像するだに (even in my imagination), 考えるだに (even to consider), 聞くだに (even hearing), 微動だに (not even a quiver).",
