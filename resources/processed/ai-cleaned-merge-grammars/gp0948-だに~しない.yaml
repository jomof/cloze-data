    "etymology": "だに is derived from the classical Japanese adverbial particle that emphasizes a minimum or lower limit. しない is the negative form of the verb する (to do). Together, they create a construction that denies something even in its smallest possible form.",
    "writeup": "「だに~しない」 is a formal and somewhat archaic expression used to emphasize a complete lack of something, even at the absolute minimum level. It is akin to saying \"not even X, so definitely not anything beyond X.\" The particle 「だに」 originates from classical Japanese and highlights the preceding noun or the stem of a suru-verb as the lowest possible boundary. When used with a negative verb, as in this construction, it conveys meanings such as \"not even,\" \"not at all,\" or \"never could have imagined.\"\n\nThis grammar point is typically encountered in literary contexts or very formal speech in modern Japanese, making it less common in everyday conversation. It is often found in fixed or semi-fixed expressions like 「夢にだに思わない」 (not even in one's dreams), 「想像だにしない」 (not even in one's imagination), or 「微動だにしない」 (not even a twitch). The construction strongly conveys a sense of impossibility or profound disbelief, emphasizing that something is beyond even the slightest expectation or possibility.",

            "nuance": "While both emphasize a minimum, 「さえ~ない」 is more common and generally less formal than 「だに~しない」. 「さえ」 can also imply a sense of 'at least' when used positively, which 「だに」 does not."

            "nuance": "Similar to 「さえ~ない」, 「すら~ない」 is also more common and less formal than 「だに~しない」. 「すら」 can sometimes carry a slightly more negative or critical nuance than 「さえ」."

            "nuance": "This is a very common idiom meaning 'not even in one's dreams' or 'never imagined.' While similar in meaning to 「夢にだに思わない」, 「夢にも～ない」 is the more contemporary and conversational choice, lacking the archaic formality of 「だに」."

            "nuance": "「全く～ない」 is a general adverbial phrase for strong negation. 「だに~しない」 is more specific, emphasizing the absence of even the *minimal* amount or possibility, whereas 「全く～ない」 simply states a complete absence."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While expressions like 「さえ~ない」 and 「すら~ない」 also convey the meaning of 'not even,' 「だに~しない」 carries a much more formal and often archaic nuance. It emphasizes the absolute minimum, suggesting that something is so unlikely or impossible that it wouldn't even occur at the most basic level. When choosing between these, consider the desired level of formality and the specific nuance of profound disbelief or complete absence you wish to convey.",
