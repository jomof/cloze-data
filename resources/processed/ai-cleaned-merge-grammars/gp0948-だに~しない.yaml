    "etymology": "だに is derived from the classical Japanese adverbial particle that emphasizes a minimum or lower limit. しない is the negative form of the verb する (to do). Together, they create a construction that denies something even in its smallest possible form. Its origin can be traced back to the Heian period, often appearing in classical literature to express extreme conditions or unlikelihood.",
    "writeup": "「だに~しない」 is a formal and somewhat archaic expression used to emphasize a complete lack of something, even at the absolute minimum level. It is akin to saying \"not even X, so definitely not anything beyond X.\" The particle 「だに」 originates from classical Japanese and highlights the preceding noun or the stem of a suru-verb as the lowest possible boundary. When used with a negative verb, as in this construction, it conveys meanings such as \"not even,\" \"not at all,\" or \"never could have imagined.\"\n\nThis grammar point is typically encountered in literary contexts or very formal speech in modern Japanese, making it less common in everyday conversation. It is often found in fixed or semi-fixed expressions like 「夢にだに思わない」 (not even in one's dreams), 「想像だにしない」 (not even in one's imagination), or 「微動だにしない」 (not even a twitch). The construction strongly conveys a sense of impossibility or profound disbelief, emphasizing that something is beyond even the slightest expectation or possibility.",
