    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に合わせて」 comes from the verb 「合わせる」 (awaseru), meaning \"to match\" or \"to combine.\" 「に合った」 comes from the verb 「合う」 (au), meaning \"to fit\" or \"to suit.\" The 「に」 indicates the target or standard to which something is being matched or fitted.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「に合わせて」, using the verb 「合わせる」 (awaseru), conveys the idea of making something match or fit with a given noun. It can also imply \"in accordance with.\" The noun before 「に」 acts as the governing factor.\n\nSimilarly, 「に合った」, using the verb 「合う」 (au) in its past tense, links two nouns, indicating that one noun has met or is suitable for the other. This is closer to saying \"(B) that has met (A).\"\n\nIn both cases, additional information is usually provided about the reason for matching or the purpose of the fit. Be mindful that 「合わせて」 can sometimes mean \"at the same time as\" or \"together with,\" where the preceding noun is the primary cause or reason.",
