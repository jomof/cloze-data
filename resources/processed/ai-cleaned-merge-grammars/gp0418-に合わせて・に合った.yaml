    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に合わせて」 comes from the verb 「合わせる」 (awaseru), meaning \"to match\" or \"to combine.\" 「に合った」 comes from the verb 「合う」 (au), meaning \"to fit\" or \"to suit.\" The 「に」 indicates the target or standard to which something is being matched or fitted.",
    "writeup": "The expressions 「に合わせて」 and 「に合った」 are used to convey the idea of conforming, adjusting, or being suitable for something. They indicate a relationship where one element is made to fit or harmonize with another.\n\n**に合わせて (ni awasete)**\nThis form uses the te-form of the verb 「合わせる」 (awaseru), which fundamentally means \"to combine,\" \"to match,\" or \"to adjust.\" When used with 「に」, it expresses an active adjustment or alignment with a standard, condition, or target. It implies a deliberate action to make something fit or be in accordance with the preceding noun. For instance, you adjust your pace to someone else's or tailor a plan to a situation.\n\n**に合った (ni atta)**\nThis form uses the past tense of the verb 「合う」 (au), meaning \"to fit,\" \"to suit,\" or \"to match\" naturally. When used with 「に」, it describes something that is inherently suitable, appropriate, or a good match for the preceding noun. It often implies a pre-existing harmony or compatibility, or that something has been found to be perfectly suited. For example, a color that naturally suits a room, or a job that perfectly fits one's skills.\n\n**Key Differences and Nuances**\n*   **に合わせて** implies an *action* of adjusting or making something conform. It suggests dynamic adaptation.\n*   **に合った** describes a *state* of suitability or a good fit. It suggests a static characteristic or a result of successful matching.\n\nBoth forms emphasize the idea of correspondence, but the nuance of active adjustment versus inherent suitability is crucial.",
