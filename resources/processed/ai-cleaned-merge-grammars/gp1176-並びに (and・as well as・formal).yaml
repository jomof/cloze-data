formation:
  Noun1 並びに Noun2: Connects two nouns or noun phrases, similar to "and" or "as well as," but more formal.
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used in formal writing and speech; often seen in legal documents, official announcements,
    and academic papers.
  colocation: Often used with official or academic terms. Commonly precedes nouns related to regulations,
    procedures, and official roles.
  grammatical-role: Connects two or more nouns or noun phrases of equal importance, functioning as a conjunction.
  logical-flow: Indicates a direct addition of elements, presenting them as a single combined unit or
    group.
  temporal-flow: Does not imply sequence; indicates simultaneous existence or consideration of connected
    items.
  spatial-flow: Implies elements existing side-by-side or jointly, without spatial separation in their
    meaning.
etymology: 「並びに」 comes from the verb 「並ぶ(ならぶ)」, meaning "to line up" or "to be side by side." It suggests
  that the items being connected are of equal standing and importance, arranged side-by-side.
writeup: 「並びに」 is a formal conjunction used to connect two or more nouns or noun phrases. It is similar
  to "and" or "as well as" in English, but it carries a more sophisticated and official tone. You'll most
  often encounter 「並びに」 in legal documents, formal announcements, and academic writing. It suggests that
  the items being connected are of equal importance. 「並びに」 implies a stronger connection than a simple
  「と」. While it connects elements of equal importance, it tends to be used for larger, more complex items
  or categories than 「及び」. Think of it as connecting primary groupings or significant entities.
false_friends:
  - term: 及び
    meaning: and
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「及び」 is also a formal "and," but it's used to connect less significant items, or items in
      a hierarchical structure. Unlike 「並びに」, it doesn't necessarily imply that the connected items are
      of equal weight.
    grammar_point: 及び (and・formal)
  - term: と
    meaning: and
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「と」 is a more general "and" that can be used in various contexts, both formal and informal.
      「並びに」 is strictly formal and used in specific situations.
    grammar_point: と (and)
  - term: 且つ
    meaning: and; moreover
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「且つ」 also connects elements in a formal context but often implies that both conditions, qualities,
      or actions hold true simultaneously or in a reinforcing way. It can connect different parts of speech,
      not just nouns, whereas 「並びに」 primarily emphasizes the joint inclusion of equally important entities.
    grammar_point: 且つ (and・moreover)
  - term: 加えて
    meaning: in addition to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「加えて」 emphasizes adding additional information or items to something already mentioned. It
      implies a sequential or additive relationship, whereas 「並びに」 introduces elements as being together
      and equally important from the outset, not as an afterthought or supplement.
    grammar_point: 加えて (in addition to)
  - term: や (non-exhaustive list)
    meaning: and (non-exhaustive list)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「並びに」, which formally connects all listed items, 「や」 indicates a non-exhaustive list
      and is informal. It suggests there are other similar items not mentioned.
    grammar_point: や (non-exhaustive list)
  - term: も~も (both neither ~ nor)
    meaning: both ~ and ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「も~も」 can also mean "both X and Y," it typically uses particles to emphasize the inclusion
      of each item and is less about forming a single, cohesive formal enumeration than 「並びに」.
    grammar_point: も~も (both neither ~ nor)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「並びに」 with similar expressions, remember that 「並びに」 is
  reserved for formal contexts where you want to emphasize that the items being connected are of equal
  importance. When in doubt, if the situation isn't particularly formal, opt for 「と」. Think of 「並びに」 for
  connecting two primary entities of equal standing, like two high-ranking officials or two major organizations.
  For conditions or characteristics that hold simultaneously, 「且つ」 might be more appropriate. If you are
  simply adding supplementary information, 「加えて」 would be a better choice. For informal, non-exhaustive
  lists, use 「や」. When emphasizing that "both X and Y" are included, consider 「も~も」, but note that it
  differs in structure and overall formality from 「並びに」.

        english: At the opening ceremony, the university president and the chairman of the board attended.
        hint: 「と」 is too casual for an official announcement about high-ranking officials attending a
          formal ceremony. We're looking for a formal conjunction.
    scene: A university representative is formally announcing who attended an important academic ceremony.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of 「並びに」 is appropriate for formally connecting two high-ranking officials, 「学長」 (university
      president) and 「理事長」 (chairman of the board), emphasizing their equal status at a significant event.
      A male university representative would typically use this formal language when making a public announcement.

          - 市 と 教育 委員 会 は、新しい 図書 館 の 建設 計画 を 発表 し た。
        english: The city and the board of education announced a plan for building a new library.
        hint: 「と」 is not formal enough for an official public announcement from governmental entities.
          We need a more formal conjunction.
    scene: A male government official is giving a public address to a female citizen, outlining recent
      civic developments.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: A male official might use 「並びに」 to convey the formal and precise nature of an announcement
      involving two separate government entities like 「市」 (city) and 「教育 委員 会」 (board of education). The
      use of this conjunction demonstrates a formal and official register suitable for addressing a female
      citizen on public matters, reflecting the seriousness of the topic.
