        "usage-context": "Primarily used by a speaker of higher status addressing a male of equal or lower status, or among male peers. Can also be used by a male of higher status addressing a female of lower status (e.g., a male teacher to a female student), or by a female student addressing a male of equal or lower status. Common in educational institutions, workplaces, and informal social settings.",
        "function": "An honorific suffix attached to names to denote familiarity, a slightly informal tone, or a hierarchical relationship.",
        "nuance": "While it shares some aspects of respect with more formal honorifics like 「さん」, 「君・くん」 carries an undertone of the speaker's implied superiority or a close, familiar bond, especially when used by men. When used by women, particularly younger ones, it can sometimes indicate affection or a gentle approach rather than strict hierarchy. It is less polite than 「さん」 but more respectful than calling someone without any honorific (呼び捨て).",
        "colocation": "Typically follows a first name, last name, or full name.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as an honorific suffix, modifying the proper noun it attaches to."
    },
    "etymology": "The kanji 君 originally meant \"lord\" or \"ruler.\" While it retains some sense of respect, as a suffix, it softens and conveys familiarity. It can also be used when addressing young children of either gender, implying a form of gentle authority or endearment.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「君・くん」 is an honorific primarily used to address males, conveying a sense of familiarity, informality, or a subtle hierarchical relationship. It is commonly attached to the first or last name of someone of equal or lower status than the speaker. For example, a male teacher might address a male student as 「田中{君}・たなかくん」.\n\nWhile predominantly used for males, there are specific contexts where 「君・くん」 can be applied to females. A male of higher status (e.g., a male teacher or senior colleague) might address a female of lower rank or age with 「君・くん」. Similarly, a female student might use 「君・くん」 to address a male student of equal or lower rank.\n\n「君・くん」 is frequently encountered in schools, workplaces, and various informal social settings where there's a clear understanding of hierarchy or a close relationship. It is considered less formal or universally polite than 「さん」, but it carries more respect than completely omitting an honorific (呼び捨て・よびすて).\n\nIts usage often implies a gentle authority or a sense of caring from the speaker's perspective, especially when used by parents towards their sons or by superiors towards their subordinates.",

            "nuance": "「さん」 is a universally polite and gender-neutral honorific used for adults. Unlike 「君」, it does not carry implications of hierarchy or a specific level of familiarity; it is generally safe to use in most situations where politeness is required."

            "nuance": "「ちゃん」 conveys a strong sense of endearment and closeness. It is most commonly used for young children (especially girls), pets, or among very close female friends and romantic partners. It is more intimate and less formal than 「君」, and generally not used in hierarchical or professional contexts."

            "nuance": "「様・さま」 is a highly formal and respectful honorific used for customers, superiors, deities, or in very formal written communication. It expresses a much higher degree of respect than 「君」 and implies a significant distance in status."

            "nuance": "「呼び捨て」 is the act of calling someone by their name without any suffix, implying extreme closeness or, if misused, extreme rudeness. It contrasts with 「君」 which, even when informal, still retains a degree of honorific function."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To effectively differentiate between these honorifics and 「君・くん」, consider the context, gender, and relationship dynamic. 「君」 is specifically tailored for addressing males, often with a subtle nuance of hierarchy or familiarity. 「さん」 is a default polite choice for general respect. 「ちゃん」 signifies deep affection, especially for children or close relationships. 「様」 is reserved for the highest level of respect. Finally, 「呼び捨て」 is the complete absence of honorifics, reserved for very intimate or disrespectful interactions.",
