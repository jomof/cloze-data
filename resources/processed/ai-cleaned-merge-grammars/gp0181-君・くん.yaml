    "meaning": "Suffix added to names, primarily for males, expressing familiarity or a slightly informal tone.",

        "Usage": "Typically used for males of equal or lower status.",
        "Context": "Common in schools, companies, and casual settings."
    },
    "etymology": "The kanji 君 originally meant \"lord\" or \"ruler.\" While it retains some sense of respect, as a suffix, it softens and conveys familiarity. It can also be used when addressing young children of either gender.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「君・くん」 is primarily used to address males, conveying a sense of familiarity or informality. It is commonly added to the first or last name of someone of equal or lower status than the speaker. For instance, a teacher might address a male student as 「田中君・たなかくん」. It's also used among male friends and colleagues. While primarily for males, in certain contexts, such as schools, a male might address a female of lower rank with 「君・くん」. Similarly, female students might use 「君・くん」 to address males of equal or lower rank. It's crucial to understand the context and relationship dynamics to use this suffix appropriately. 「君・くん」 is considered less polite than 「さん」, but more polite than 「呼び捨て・よびすて」 (calling someone by their first name without any honorifics).",
