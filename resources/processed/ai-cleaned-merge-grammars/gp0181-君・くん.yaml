        "[Last Name] + 君": "Used with a surname, often by a superior or elder addressing a junior or younger male, or among male peers.",
        "[First Name] + 君": "Used with a given name, typically conveying familiarity or endearment, common among peers, or by parents to their sons.",

    "meaning": "Suffix added to names, primarily for males, expressing familiarity, a slightly informal tone, or a hierarchical relationship.",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "suffix",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Primarily used by a speaker of higher status addressing a male of equal or lower status, or among male peers. Can also be used by a male of higher status addressing a female of lower status (e.g., a male teacher to a female student), or by a female student addressing a male of equal or lower status. Common in educational institutions, workplaces, and informal social settings.",
        "function": "An honorific suffix attached to names to denote familiarity, a slightly informal tone, or a hierarchical relationship.",
        "nuance": "While it shares some aspects of respect with more formal honorifics like 「さん」, 「君・くん」 carries an undertone of the speaker's implied superiority or a close, familiar bond, especially when used by men. When used by women, particularly younger ones, it can sometimes indicate affection or a gentle approach rather than strict hierarchy. It is less polite than 「さん」 but more respectful than calling someone without any honorific (呼び捨て).",
        "colocation": "Typically follows a first name, last name, or full name.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as an honorific suffix, modifying the proper noun it attaches to."
    },
    "etymology": "The kanji 君 originally meant \"lord\" or \"ruler.\" While it retains some sense of respect, as a suffix, it softens and conveys familiarity. It can also be used when addressing young children of either gender, implying a form of gentle authority or endearment.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「君・くん」 is an honorific primarily used to address males, conveying a sense of familiarity, informality, or a subtle hierarchical relationship. It is commonly attached to the first or last name of someone of equal or lower status than the speaker. For example, a male teacher might address a male student as 「田中{君}・たなかくん」.\n\nWhile predominantly used for males, there are specific contexts where 「君・くん」 can be applied to females. A male of higher status (e.g., a male teacher or senior colleague) might address a female of lower rank or age with 「君・くん」. Similarly, a female student might use 「君・くん」 to address a male student of equal or lower rank.\n\n「君・くん」 is frequently encountered in schools, workplaces, and various informal social settings where there's a clear understanding of hierarchy or a close relationship. It is considered less formal or universally polite than 「さん」, but it carries more respect than completely omitting an honorific (呼び捨て・よびすて).\n\nIts usage often implies a gentle authority or a sense of caring from the speaker's perspective, especially when used by parents towards their sons or by superiors towards their subordinates.",
