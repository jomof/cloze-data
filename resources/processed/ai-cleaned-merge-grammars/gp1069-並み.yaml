    "etymology": "並み (nami) comes from the noun form of the classical verb 並む (naranu), which evolved into 並ぶ (narabu), meaning \"to line up\" or \"to be in line.\"",
    "writeup": "並み (nami) means \"on par with,\" \"worthy of,\" or \"as standard for\" something. It's used as a suffix after nouns. Think of it as \"in line with (A),\" where (A) has a recognized standard or norm. However, the literal translation of ‘in line with (A)’ also works just as well in many cases.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   While 並み (nami) can mean \"as standard for,\" the \"average\" or \"ordinary\" meaning is often reserved for when 並み (nami) is used by itself as a noun, often written as 並 (nami) followed by the particle の (no) and another noun. For example, 「並の人」- average person.\n*   並み (nami) is best used when (A) has a well-recognized or easily identifiable standard. If the \"norm\" is subjective, it can sound unnatural.",
