        "[Noun] + 並みだ/です": "Indicates that something is on par with, or of the same standard as, the preceding noun. Often implies an unexpected or impressive level.",
        "[Noun] + 並みの + [Noun]": "Describes a subsequent noun as being on the same level, or of the same standard, as the preceding noun. Can also mean 'average' or 'ordinary' when 並み is used alone (e.g., 並の人).",

        "part-of-speech": "suffix",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "General usage",
        "nuance": "When used alone as a noun (並), it often means 'average' or 'ordinary'. When appended to a noun, it implies meeting or exceeding the standard of that noun. It is most naturally used for things with a widely recognized standard or norm."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「並み」 comes from the noun form of the classical verb 「並む」 (naramu), which shares the same meaning as the modern verb 「並ぶ」 (narabu), meaning \"to line up\" or \"to be in line.\" This etymology connects the grammar point to the idea of being aligned or on the same level as something else.",
    "writeup": "「並み」 is a versatile suffix that attaches to nouns to indicate that something is \"on par with,\" \"worthy of,\" or \"as standard for\" the preceding noun. It highlights a comparison where the subject is considered to be at the same level or standard as the noun it modifies. This often carries a nuance of exceeding expectations, especially when used in constructions like 「プロ並み」 (on par with a professional).\n\nWhen 「並み」 is used as a standalone noun, typically written as 「並」 and followed by the particle 「の」 (e.g., 「並の人」), it takes on the meaning of \"average\" or \"ordinary.\" This distinction is crucial for understanding its full range of applications.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「並み」 is most naturally used when the noun it refers to has a clear, well-recognized standard or norm. For instance, \"professional skill\" or \"summer heat\" have widely understood levels. If the \"norm\" is subjective or based purely on personal opinion, using 「並み」 might sound unnatural. For example, saying 「このラーメンは私の好み並みだ」 (This ramen is on par with my preference) would be awkward because \"my preference\" is not a universally recognized standard.\n*   While 「並み」 often implies a positive comparison (e.g., someone's skill being surprisingly good), it can also be neutral or even negative, simply stating a factual equivalence.",
