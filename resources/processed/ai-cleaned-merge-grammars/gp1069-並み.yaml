    "etymology": "The term 「並み」 comes from the noun form of the classical verb 「並む」 (naramu), which shares the same meaning as the modern verb 「並ぶ」 (narabu), meaning \"to line up\" or \"to be in line.\" This etymology connects the grammar point to the idea of being aligned or on the same level as something else.",
    "writeup": "「並み」 is a noun suffix that follows nouns, indicating that something is “on par with,” “worthy of,” or “as standard for” the preceding noun. It suggests a comparison where the subject is considered to be at the same level or standard as the noun it modifies.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「並み」 can also mean \"average\" or \"ordinary\" when used as a noun by itself, typically followed by the particle 「の」. For example, 「並の人」 (nami no hito) means \"average person.\"\n*   The use of 「並み」 is most natural when the noun it refers to has a well-recognized standard or norm. If the \"norm\" is subjective or based on personal opinion, using 「並み」 may sound unnatural.",
