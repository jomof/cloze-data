grammar_point: まい〜のように (almost every time)
learn_before:
  - ように (purpose or desired state)
id: gp0281
meaning: Almost every ~, Nearly every ~, On a ~ basis
pronunciation:
  katakana: マイノヨウニ
  romaji: mai no yō ni
formation:
  まい + [Measurement of Time] + のように: Indicates something happens 'almost every' or 'nearly every' specified
    time period.
jlpt: N4
etymology: 「まい」 (mai) originates from the kanji 毎, meaning 'every'. 「のように」 (no yō ni) functions as 'like'
  or 'in the manner of'. Therefore, 「まい〜のように」 literally conveys 'in the manner of every', signifying a
  behavior or occurrence that closely approximates happening every single time.
writeup: まい〜のように (mai no yō ni) indicates that something happens with a high degree of frequency, often
  translated as "almost every ~", "nearly every ~", or "on a ~ basis". The phrase combines 毎 (mai), meaning
  "every", with のように (no yō ni), which means "like" or "in the manner of". Thus, the literal interpretation
  is "in the manner of every [time period]". This grammar point is used with words expressing measurements,
  typically time periods, such as 毎日 (mainichi - every day), 毎週 (maishuu - every week), or 毎年 (maitoshi
  - every year). While 毎 itself means "every", the addition of のように softens the absoluteness, implying
  that something occurs so regularly it's **as if** it happens every single time, or very nearly so. It
  can express either a slight exaggeration or a close approximation. **Important Consideration:** Unlike
  general usage where みたいに (mitaini) and のように (no yō ni) are often interchangeable, this does not apply
  to まい〜のように. The phrase みたいだ (mitaida) is an abbreviation of the more formal を見たような (wo mita youna),
  which implies seeing or perceiving something. Therefore, using みたいに with time measurements or abstract
  concepts that cannot be "seen" can sound unnatural. まい〜のように specifically uses のように because it refers
  to the **manner** in which something occurs, even if that manner is abstract.

    meaning: Each, Every
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ごとに」 emphasizes *each and every* instance without exception. 「まい〜のように」, in contrast, implies

  - term: たびに
    meaning: Each time, Every time, Whenever
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「たびに」 refers to something happening *every single time* a specific event occurs, indicating
      a direct correlation between the event and the consequence. 「まい〜のように」 focuses on general, high frequency
      over a period, not necessarily tied to a specific trigger event.

  - term: おきに
    meaning: Repeated at intervals, Every other, Every, At intervals of
    kind: often confused with

      describes a general, approximate frequency that is not necessarily bound by precise, measured intervals.
    grammar_point: おきに (at intervals of)
  - term: につき
    meaning: Due to, On account of, Each or every
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「につき」 is often used for quantitative distribution (e.g., 'per item') or as a formal reason,
      giving a sense of "for each" or "per unit". It carries a formal or official tone, whereas 「まい〜のように」
      is more conversational and less precise in its quantification.
    grammar_point: につき (due to or per)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「まい〜のように」 specifically indicates frequency
  – something happens 'almost every' set period of time, implying a high degree of regularity but with
  a slight allowance for exceptions or approximations. The other expressions listed focus on each instance,
  fixed intervals, or formal quantification. When choosing, consider whether you want to emphasize 'each
  time' or 'almost every time', and the level of formality.
