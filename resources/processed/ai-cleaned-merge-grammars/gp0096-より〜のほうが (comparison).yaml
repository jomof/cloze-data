        "function": "comparison, expressing preference",
        "nuance": "This pattern explicitly sets up a comparison between two items, with the first item (marked by より) being the lesser or less preferred, and the second item (marked by のほうが/のほうを) being the greater or preferred. It can be used in various registers by adjusting the sentence-final particle or verb ending."
    },
    "etymology": "「より」 (yori) translates to \"than\" or \"from,\" indicating a point of comparison or origin. 「のほうが」 (no hou ga) literally means \"the direction of\" or \"the side of,\" implying a preference or a higher degree of something. When combined, they form a structure that clearly delineates two items and highlights which one possesses a certain quality to a greater extent, or which one is preferred.",
    "writeup": "「より〜のほうが」 is a fundamental grammar pattern used for making comparisons in Japanese. It directly translates to \"to be more ~ than ~\" or \"prefer ~ over ~\". The particle 「より」 (yori) is affixed to the item or action that is being compared *against* (the lesser or less preferred item). Following this, 「のほうが」 (no hou ga) points to the item or action that is greater in quality or the one that is preferred.\n\nThis construction can be used to compare two nouns, two clauses (representing actions or situations), or even a noun against a clause, as long as 「のほうが」 is followed by an adjective or a phrase expressing quality or preference. For example, comparing a noun with an adjective: 「リンゴ より ミカン のほうが おいしい」 (Mikan is more delicious than apples). Comparing actions: 「本 を 読む より 映画 を 見る のほう が 楽しい」 (Watching movies is more enjoyable than reading books).\n\n**Particle Usage: を vs. が**\n\nWhen expressing desire or preference with verbs like 「したい」 (shitai - want to do) or 「ほしい」 (hoshii - want/desire), both 「が」 (ga) and 「を」 (o) can be used after 「のほう」. The choice subtly shifts the emphasis:\n*   Using 「のほうが」: This construction, while generally used for comparisons of inherent qualities, can also indicate a preference, often with 「ほしい」. It tends to emphasize the **overall statement of preference** or the desire itself. For example, 「新しい 車 より 古い 車 のほう が ほしい」 (I want the old car more than the new one).\n*   Using 「のほうを」: This form is particularly common with 「したい」 but also acceptable with 「ほしい」. It emphasizes the **object or action being preferred**. For instance, 「家 で 勉強 する より 図書館 で 勉強 する のほう を し たい」 (I want to study at the library more than at home). The 「を」 marks the preferred item as the direct object of the verb of desire. Both are generally acceptable and sound natural in these contexts, though the nuance of emphasis varies slightly.\n\n**Implicit Comparisons with より**\n\nOccasionally, 「より」 can appear by itself to indicate a comparison, with 「のほうが」 implicitly understood. In such cases, 「より」 might be translated as \"more than\" or \"comparatively.\" For example, 「これ は より 高い」 (Kore wa より takai - This is more expensive) can imply \"This is more expensive (than other things, implicitly).\" While grammatically valid, this usage is less common for explicit two-item comparisons and is typically clearer when 「のほうが」 is explicitly included. The full 「より〜のほうが」 pattern provides a clear and unambiguous comparison.",
