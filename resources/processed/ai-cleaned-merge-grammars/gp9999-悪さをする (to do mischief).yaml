jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Primarily used to describe minor misbehavior, especially by children or animals, often
    implying naughtiness rather than serious malice.
  function: To express that someone is doing something naughty or mischievous.
  nuance: Carries a nuance of lighthearted wrongdoing, often not seriously harmful. It focuses on the
    act of being naughty or troublesome, rather than the severe consequences.
  grammatical-role: Predicate
etymology: The phrase combines 悪さ (warusa), which is a nominalization of the adjective 悪い (warui - bad),
  literally meaning "badness" or "wrongness," and をする (o suru), meaning "to do." Thus, it literally translates
  to "to do badness" or "to do naughty things." The particle を (o) marks 悪さ as the direct object of the
  verb する (suru).
writeup: |-
  悪さをする (warusa o suru) is a common Japanese expression meaning "to do mischief" or "to be naughty." It is most frequently used to describe the actions of children or pets who are engaging in minor misbehavior. The nuance of this phrase is generally lighthearted; it implies naughtiness or playfulness rather than serious malice or harmful intent. For example, a child might be said to be 悪さをする if they are drawing on walls, making a mess, or pulling harmless pranks.

  While it can technically be used for adults, it often sounds infantilizing or implies that the adult's actions are childishly mischievous rather than seriously problematic. For more serious wrongdoing, other phrases like 悪いことをする (warui koto o suru - to do bad things) or 問題を起こす (mondai o okosu - to cause problems) would be more appropriate.

  This phrase highlights an important cultural aspect where minor misbehaviors, especially in children, are often viewed with a degree of tolerance or even endearment, as long as they do not cross into truly harmful territory. The nominalizer さ (sa) attached to 悪い (warui) emphasizes the 'quality' or 'state' of being bad, making it a noun that can be acted upon.

    meaning: to play a prank, to do mischief
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While very similar to 悪さをする, いたずらをする often implies a more intentional, playful prank or trick.
      悪さをする can be more general, referring to any minor naughtiness, even unintentional.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:いたずらをする (to play a prank・mischief)
  - term: 悪いことをする
    meaning: to do bad things
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This phrase is much broader and can refer to any 'bad thing,' from minor wrongdoing to serious
      crimes. It lacks the 'naughty' or 'playful' nuance often associated with 悪さをする.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:悪いことをする (to do bad things)
  - term: 問題を起こす
    meaning: to cause problems
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This implies creating actual issues or difficulties for others, often with more significant
      consequences than mere mischief. It's less about the 'naughtiness' and more about the 'trouble caused.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:問題を起こす (to cause problems)
  - term: 迷惑をかける
    meaning: to cause trouble, to inconvenience
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This phrase specifically focuses on causing inconvenience or annoyance to others. While mischief
      can cause inconvenience, this phrase emphasizes the impact on others rather than the act of naughtiness
      itself.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:迷惑をかける (to cause trouble・inconvenience)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate, remember that 悪さをする (warusa o suru) generally implies a
  childish or pet-like 'naughtiness' or minor misbehavior. いたずらをする (itazura o suru) is specifically about
  playing pranks. 悪いことをする (warui koto o suru) is a general term for doing anything 'bad,' which can range
  from minor to severe. 問題を起こす (mondai o okosu) is about causing 'problems,' which implies a higher degree
  of impact, and 迷惑をかける (meiwaku o kakeru) focuses on 'inconveniencing' others. Choose 悪さをする when the
  action is relatively harmless, often playful, and fits the context of a child or pet being 'naughty.'

    scene: A mother is telling her friend about her active son.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of {悪さをする} here implies typical, playful naughtiness common for a child, like making
      a mess or playing too boisterously, rather than anything seriously wrong. The speaker is a mother.

        english: The kitten is doing bad things again in the kitchen.
        hint: 「悪いことをする」 implies general bad behavior, which might be too strong for a kitten's playful
          naughtiness. We're looking for something that specifically means mischief.
    scene: Someone observes their new kitten playfully knocking things over.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    nuance: This sentence uses the progressive form {悪さしている}, indicating the mischief is ongoing. It's
      a typical expression for a pet's playful but slightly troublesome actions, such as climbing where

    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: The use of ~ものだ (mono da) at the end expresses a general truth or tendency. Even typically
      well-behaved children can engage in minor {悪さ} (mischief). This makes the statement more of a general
      observation.
    etymology: おとなしい (otonashii) refers to being quiet, obedient, or docile. 子 (ko) means child. 時々 (tokidoki)
      means sometimes.

    register: casual

      ne) indicates that the speaker heard about it and is seeking confirmation, adding a lighthearted,
      gossipy tone.

    scene: An older sibling warns their younger sibling not to misbehave.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    nuance: The contracted form {悪さすると} (warusa suru to) is very casual. The conditional form and the

      to the warning.

          - 犬 は 退屈 だ から いたずら を する こと が ある よ ね。
        english: Dogs sometimes play pranks because they're bored.

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The phrase こと が ある (koto ga aru) indicates that something happens 'sometimes' or 'there are
      times when.' This makes it a general observation about dog behavior, rather than a specific instance.
    etymology: 退屈 (taikutsu) means boredom. 犬 (inu) is dog.

    setting: instructional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: '{悪さしては} いけません (warusa shite wa ikemasen) is a firm prohibition, common from an adult to a
      child. The ては (te wa) form followed by いけません (ikemasen) clearly states that the action is not allowed.'
    etymology: 公共 の 場 (kōkyō no ba) means public place. いけません (ikemasen) means not allowed or must not.

          - 子供 たち の いたずら で、教室 が ずいぶん 散らかっ た。
        english: The children's pranks caused quite a mess in the classroom.

          the mess.

    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: Here, {悪さで} (warusa de) is used as a cause or reason, indicating that the children's mischief
      led to the mess. This shows a direct consequence of their actions, albeit still within the realm
      of minor trouble.

      meaning to be messy or scattered.

        english: If the cat starts doing bad things, it means it wants attention.

          We're looking for 'mischief'.
    scene: A pet owner explaining their cat's behavior to a visitor.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The combination of {悪さし始めたら} (warusa shi hajimedara - if it starts doing mischief) implies
      that the mischief is a deliberate action by the cat to get a reaction. サイン (sain) is a loanword
      from English 'sign', indicating a signal from the cat.
    etymology: 猫 (neko) means cat. かまってほしい (kamatte hoshii) means 'wanting to be paid attention to' or
      'wanting attention'.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 悪さをする is highly versatile, applicable to both
  children and animals, and can be used in various tenses and registers. It consistently conveys the idea
  of playful or minor misbehavior. Pay attention to the particle を (o) directly preceding する (suru), as
  this indicates that 悪さ (warusa) is the direct object of the verb 'to do'. The nuances often depend on
  the context and the speaker's implied feeling towards the 'mischief' being described.
