    "writeup": "The 「と」 conditional expresses a natural, predictable, or inevitable consequence. Think of it as \"when A happens, B *always* happens.\" It is stronger than other conditional forms like 「ば」, 「たら」, or 「なら」 because it highlights a result that is considered a given. \n\nIt is primarily used for:\n\n*   **General truths or natural phenomena:** Things that are universally true or always occur under certain conditions (e.g., \"When spring comes, flowers bloom.\").\n*   **Directions or instructions:** Describing a sequence of actions with guaranteed, automatic outcomes (e.g., \"If you turn the key, the engine starts.\").\n*   **Habitual actions:** Describing actions that consistently lead to the same outcome (e.g., \"When I get home, I always take a bath.\").\n*   **Discoveries:** Describing what one finds upon doing something, implying an immediate and expected result (e.g., \"When I opened the box, there was a cat inside.\").\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The 「と」 conditional describes something inevitable or natural. It **cannot** be used for hypothetical situations, expressing personal will, commands, requests, or suggestions in the result clause. For these, other conditional forms are necessary. For example, you cannot say 「ボタンを押すと、座りなさい。」 ('If you press the button, sit down.').\n*   The verb in the 「と」 clause is always in the non-past form, even if referring to a past event whose consequence was immediately observed. The tense of the overall action is indicated in the result clause.\n*   Its inherent meaning of an automatic, certain consequence sets it apart from other conditional forms, making it suitable for scientific explanations, instruction manuals, or describing fixed routines.",
