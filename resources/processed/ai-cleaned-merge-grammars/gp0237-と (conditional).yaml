    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 originally indicated a co-occurrence or simultaneity between two events. This evolved into expressing a conditional relationship where one event naturally follows or is a consequence of another. The conditional 「と」 is closely related to the conjunctive particle 「と」 meaning \"and,\" highlighting the inherent connection between the condition and the result.",
    "writeup": "The 「と」 conditional expresses a strong connection between a condition and its result. Unlike 「ば」, 「なら」, or 「たら」, 「と」 implies that the result is a natural, inevitable, or habitual consequence of the condition. It's closer in meaning to \"and,\" indicating that when A happens, B *always* or *naturally* follows.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n\n*   **Definite Result:** The result (B) is considered certain to occur when the condition (A) is met. It's not about possibilities but about established relationships.\n*   **Non-Volitional:** 「と」 is generally not used with volitional forms (commands, requests, suggestions) in the result clause because it describes natural consequences, not actions.\n*   **Habitual Actions:** 「と」 can describe habitual actions or general truths.\n*   **Discoveries:** 「と」 is often used to express a discovery or realization upon performing an action.",
