    "etymology": "「確かに」 comes from the な-adjective 「確か (tashika)」, meaning \"certain\" or \"sure\". Adding 「に」 turns it into an adverb, intensifying the sense of certainty.",
    "writeup": "「確かに」 is the adverbial form of the な-adjective 「確か」, meaning \"certain\" or \"sure\". It functions similarly to \"certainly\", \"surely\", or \"indeed\" in English. It's often used when the speaker wants to emphasize that something is definitely the case, often as a confirmation of a previously stated or observed fact, or even as a concession in an argument. This expression reflects a strong sense of acknowledgement or agreement with a truth.",

            "nuance": "「確か」 without the 「に」 is often used when you're unsure about something, like \"If I remember correctly...\" or \"I think...\". Unlike 「確かに」, it doesn't express certainty, but rather a recollection with a hint of doubt or a personal assumption.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「本当に」 emphasizes the truthfulness or intensity of a statement (e.g., \"It's *really* good\"), 「確かに」 emphasizes the speaker's agreement, confirmation, or acknowledgement of a point, often when it aligns with an expectation or a realization. 「確かに」 can also imply a concession, acknowledging a point even if it's contrary to one's initial thought.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「確かに」 expresses a confirmation of an observed or agreed-upon truth (e.g., \"Indeed, that is true\"), 「に違いない」 conveys the speaker's strong conviction or logical deduction that something must be true, based on their reasoning, without necessarily implying prior observation or agreement with another's statement.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Be careful not to confuse 「確かに」 with 「確か」. 「確かに」 is an adverb that emphasizes certainty, while 「確か」 often introduces something you're not entirely sure about. Also, distinguish 「確かに」 from 「本当に」; while both can convey truth, 「確かに」 focuses more on agreement or concession, rather than just intensity. Finally, while 「に違いない」 and 「確かに」 both express certainty, 「に違いない」 often expresses a personal strong deduction, whereas 「確かに」 is more about confirming or acknowledging an observed reality or another's statement.",
