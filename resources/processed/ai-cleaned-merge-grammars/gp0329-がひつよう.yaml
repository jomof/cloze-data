    "etymology": "「必要 (hitsuyou)」 is a Sino-Japanese word meaning \"necessary\" or \"essential.\" The が particle marks the noun as the subject of the necessity.",
    "writeup": "「が必要」 is a common expression used to emphasize the **need** or **necessity** of something. It always follows a noun. Verbs must be nominalized (turned into noun-phrases) to use this construction, often by using 「こと」. The 「だ」 or 「です」 can be dropped in very casual speech, but it's best to keep 「が」 to clearly mark what is necessary.",
