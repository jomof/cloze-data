details:
  part-of-speech: suffix
  register: semi-formal
  function: Forms a noun indicating the method, way, or means of performing the verb. Often used with
    verbs like がない (nai) or が悪い (warui) to express that something is impossible or difficult to do.
  nuance: Suggests a manner or method, often implying that there is a specific or correct way of doing
    something. Can also imply difficulty or impossibility when used with negative constructions.
  colocation: V-ます + ようがない (there is no way to do...); V-ます + ようが悪い (the way of doing...is bad); V-ます
    + ようによっては (depending on how you do something, different outcomes).
etymology: 「よう」 originates from the verb 「為る（する）」, meaning "to do." Over time, it evolved into a suffix
  indicating the *manner* or *way* of doing something. Its usage reflects a transition from a verb of
  action to a noun emphasizing the method of action.
writeup: |-
  The 「よう」 grammar point, when attached to the ます-stem of a verb, transforms the verb into a noun that describes **the method, way, or means of performing that action.** It frequently appears in phrases like 「～ようがない」 (there's no way to do...) or 「～ようによっては」 (depending on how you do...). Consider it a way to discuss *how* something is done or *if* something can be done at all.

  It is often used to express impossibility or difficulty, especially with 「～ようがない」. For example, 「直しようがない」 means "there's no way to fix it." While similar to 「方」 (kata), 「よう」 often carries a nuance of method or means, sometimes implying a specific or correct way of doing something. It can also imply that no method exists.
false_friends:
  - term: 方
    meaning: way; method
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「よう」 often focuses on the feasibility or absence of a specific means, 「方」 generally
      refers to the method or manner. For instance, 「やりようがない」 implies no *possible way* to do it, while
      「やり方がない」 suggests no established *method*.
    grammar_point: かた (way of doing)
  - term: 仕様がない
    meaning: it can't be helped; nothing can be done
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ようがない」 expresses the absence of a method or means to *do* something, 「仕様がない」 signifies
      that a situation is unavoidable or beyond one's control, often expressing resignation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:仕様がない (it can't be helped)
  - term: にくい
    meaning: difficult to do; hard to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ようがない」 implies there's *no way* or method to perform an action at all, 「にくい」 indicates
      that an action is *difficult* to perform, but not necessarily impossible.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]にくい (difficult to do)'
  - term: Verb[potential-negative]
    meaning: cannot do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「V-potential + ない」 (e.g., 「できない」) simply states an inability to do something, whereas 「V-ようがない」
      emphasizes that there is *no available method or means* to do it, implying futility rather than
      just lack of ability.
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「よう」 and 「方」 can indicate ways of doing something, 「よう」 tends to
  be used when expressing whether something can be done or how it can be done, often in negative constructions,
  focusing on the feasibility of the action. 「方」, on the other hand, is more general and refers to the
  method itself, akin to 'how to'. 「仕様がない」, in contrast, implies an unavoidable situation. Lastly, plain
  potential negative forms like 「できない」 state simple inability, whereas 「～ようがない」 emphasizes the complete
  absence of a method or approach.

        hint: 「修理 {でき} ません」 means it simply 'cannot be repaired'. We're looking for an expression that
          emphasizes there's 'no method' or 'no way' to fix it, highlighting the futility.

    nuance: The 「んだよ」 at the end, coupled with a female speaker, adds a slightly exasperated but caring
      tone, often used by an older sister towards a younger brother when giving advice. The more polite
      version 「んです よ」 maintains a similar nuance with added politeness.

        english: If you're asked in that way, you can't answer.
        hint: 「{答え られ} ません」 means 'can't answer'. We're looking for a phrase that implies there's 'no

      nuance.

        hint: While 「結び{方}」 refers to the general 'way of tying', 「結び {よう}」 here specifically points to

          the specific execution.

post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 「よう」 is versatile. While it often appears in
  negative contexts emphasizing impossibility, it can also be used in positive contexts to describe a
  specific, often notable, way of doing something, as seen in the example of dancing. Its core remains
  the focus on the *how* of an action.
