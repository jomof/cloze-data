    "etymology": "The filler 「さ」 is believed to have originated from the end of sentence particle 「さ」, which is used to add emphasis or seek agreement. Over time, it evolved into a versatile interjection used to fill pauses and soften speech.",
    "writeup": "「さ」 is an interjection in Japanese primarily used in casual speech (**タメ語**). It functions much like English fillers such as \"like,\" \"you know,\" or \"uhh.\" While often used to fill pauses, create thinking time, or soften a statement, 「さ」 has broader applications. It can be employed to invite or incite action, to express mild surprise or bewilderment, or to simply control the flow of a conversation by signaling that the speaker has not finished speaking.\n\nIts usage is versatile and can appear at various points within a sentence. The \"confusion\" that this 「さ」 might imply is not necessarily negative; rather, it often serves to signal a moment of thought or to make a statement feel more conversational and less abrupt.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Distinguishing between the filler 「さ」 and the interjection 「さ」 depends heavily on context. The filler 「さ」 tends to be interspersed within sentences, often multiple times, whereas the interjection 「さ」 is more likely to appear at the beginning of a sentence or a distinct phrase.",
