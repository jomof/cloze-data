    "etymology": "The filler 「さ」 is believed to have originated from the end of sentence particle 「さ」, which is used to add emphasis or seek agreement. Over time, it evolved into a versatile interjection used to fill pauses and soften speech.",
    "writeup": "「さ」 is an interjection in Japanese primarily used in casual speech (**タメ語**). It functions much like English fillers such as \"like,\" \"you know,\" or \"uhh.\" While often used to fill pauses, create thinking time, or soften a statement, 「さ」 has broader applications. It can be employed to invite or incite action, to express mild surprise or bewilderment, or to simply control the flow of a conversation by signaling that the speaker has not finished speaking.\n\nIts usage is versatile and can appear at various points within a sentence. The \"confusion\" that this 「さ」 might imply is not necessarily negative; rather, it often serves to signal a moment of thought or to make a statement feel more conversational and less abrupt.",
