    "etymology": "The filler 「さ」 is believed to have originated from the end of sentence particle 「さ」, which is used to add emphasis or seek agreement. Over time, it evolved into a versatile interjection used to fill pauses and soften speech.",
    "writeup": "「さ」 is an interjection in Japanese used primarily in casual speech (**タメ語**). Think of it like saying \"like,\" \"you know,\" or \"uhh\" in English. It's often used when the speaker is searching for words, needs thinking time, or wants to soften the tone of their statement. It's not necessarily indicative of confusion but rather a way to maintain the flow of conversation. It can appear anywhere in a sentence.",
