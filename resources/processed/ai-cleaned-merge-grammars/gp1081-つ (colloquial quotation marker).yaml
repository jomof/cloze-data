jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Common in very casual conversation, especially among younger speakers.
  function: Functions as a colloquial quotation marker, or to introduce a concept or description in an
    informal manner.
  nuance: Carries a very casual, often colloquial, and sometimes abrupt tone. It is an extreme abbreviation,
    signaling a relaxed and informal speech style. The variant 'っつ' may imply a slight pause or a frustrated
    tone, though this is not always the case.
etymology: 「つ」 originates from an abbreviation of 「という」. 「という」 is composed of the quotation particle 「と」
  and the verb 「言う (いう)」 (to say). Over time, 「という」 was shortened to 「つ」 in very casual speech.
writeup: The grammar pattern 「つ」 is a highly abbreviated, slang form of 「という」. It is used to quote something
  that was previously stated, to refer to something that is known as (A), or to mention something that
  is called (A). Fundamentally, 「という」 is a combination of the quotation particle 「と」 and the verb 「言う」
  (to say). Due to 「と」 being a quotation particle, 「つ」 maintains the versatility to follow almost any
  word or statement, functioning as a flexible conversational connector. Despite being strong slang, 「つ」
  is very common in modern Japanese, particularly in casual conversation among friends or peers. While
  native speakers often abbreviate 「という」 to varying degrees, 「つ」 represents the shortest possible form.
  Other common abbreviated forms include 「って」 and 「っつ」, and sometimes even 「つう」. It is crucial to remember
  that even though the verb 「言う」 is omitted in 「つ」, the grammar point can still be conjugated. For instance,
  to express past tense, you would use 「つった」 (from 「言った」), and for the progressive form, 「つってん」 (from
  「言っている」, abbreviated to 「言ってん」). Understanding these conjugated forms is essential for natural usage.
false_friends:
  - term: って
    meaning: Casual quotation marker; said; heard; regarding
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both `つ` and `って` are casual quotation markers derived from `という`. However, `つ` is a *more
      extreme and specific* abbreviation used primarily for "said that" or "called", often indicating
      extreme casualness or even brusqueness. `って` is a broader, more commonly used casual particle with
      a wider range of functions beyond just quoting, such as topic marking or indicating means.
    grammar_point: って (quotation)
  - term: という
    meaning: Called; named; known as; as much as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`という` is the complete and grammatically correct form for quoting, defining, or naming. `つ`
      is a highly informal, slang abbreviation of `という`, suitable only for very casual speech and often
      perceived as rough or abrupt compared to the standard `という`.'
    grammar_point: という (naming and definition)
  - term: そうだ
    meaning: I heard that; It is said that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`そうだ` conveys reported information or what one has heard, focusing on the source of information.
      `つ` (from `という`) focuses on the *act* of saying or calling something, or what something *is called*,
      often without explicitly stating the source, and is highly casual.'
    grammar_point: そうだ (hear that)
  - term: らしい
    meaning: I hear that; It is said that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`らしい` conveys information based on observation or what has been heard, implying a strong
      likelihood or typicality. While `つ` also relates to what is ''said'', it is a direct colloquial
      abbreviation of `という` for direct quotation or naming, not a general inference based on hearsay.'
    grammar_point: らしい (I hear, it seems)
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions relate to conveying information, `つ` is a highly
  abbreviated, slang form specifically derived from `という` (to say/be called). It implies a direct quote
  or a label, often with a casual or even blunt tone. `って` is a broader casual particle, also deriving
  from `という` but used more widely for casual quoting, topic marking, or indicating means, and is generally
  less abrupt than `つ`. In contrast, `そうだ` (hear that) explicitly focuses on reporting information heard
  from a source, and `らしい` (I hear, it seems) conveys an impression or strong likelihood based on observation
  or indirect information. When using `つ`, consider the very informal context and its specific implication
  of direct quotation or naming, distinct from general hearsay or inference.

    english_literally: Hey, what did you say just now (abbreviated quote)?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - おい、今 なんて {つ} ったって、聞こえ なかっ た よ。
        english: Even if you said that, I didn't hear it.
        hint: The additional 'って' here gives a 'even if' nuance, implying that the speaker *did* say it
          but it wasn't heard, whereas the original is simply asking 'what did you say?'
    scene: A young man asking his friend to repeat something he didn't quite catch.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「おい」 and the informal 「なんてつった」 (a colloquial contraction of 「何と言った」) makes this
      very casual and direct, typical between close male friends.
  - english: What on earth is that guy talking about?
    japanese:
      - あいつ は いったい 何 {つ} ってん の さ？

          - あいつ、何 か 問題 {つ} ってん の か？
        english: Is he saying there's some problem?
        hint: This implies someone is *reporting* a problem using `つってん`. The original is asking what
          *incomprehensible* thing the person is saying, reflecting exasperation.
    scene: A young woman expressing irritation about someone's incomprehensible remarks to her friend.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「あいつ」 is a very informal and slightly derogatory way to refer to someone. 「何つってんのさ」 is a casual,
      frustrated form of 「何と言っているの」, with 「さ」 adding a dismissive or exasperated tone often used by women.

          - 田中 が『もう すぐ 着く』{つ}った の を 忘れ た の？
        english: Did you forget that Tanaka said, 'I'll arrive soon'?
        hint: This uses `つった` as part of a noun clause, focusing on *forgetting* the content of what was
          said. The original simply reports what was said.
    scene: A coworker relaying a message from Tanaka to a colleague who is waiting.

        english: He calls himself a 'weirdo' and doesn't even doubt it.
        hint: Here, `つって` is used reflexively, indicating the person *calls himself* a 'weirdo'. The original
          describes a reputation *among others*.

        english: That's why I'm saying this is no good, I've been saying it all along!
        hint: This uses `つ` for the direct quote, but then follows it with `ずっと言ってる` to emphasize repeated
          past action. The original `つってんのよ` is a more compressed and exasperated form implying a current
          state of repeating.
    scene: A mother firmly telling her child that a certain action is not allowed.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「つってんのよ」 (a shortened form of 「と言っているのよ」) uses the female-associated sentence-ending
      particle 「よ」 in conjunction with the informal 「つってん」, expressing a strong, frustrated assertion
      commonly heard from women.
  - english: If you wear such strange clothes, you'll really stand out!
    japanese:
      - そんな に 変 な 格好 {つ} ったら、浮く よ！
      - そんな 変 な 格好 {つ} ったら、間違い なく 浮く よ。
      - あんな 変 な 服 {つ} ったら、恥ずかしい よ な？
    english_literally: Such a strange attire, if you wear (abbreviated conditional quote), you will stand
      out, you know!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな に 変 な 格好 {つ} ったら、周り が 何 と 言う か 知れ ない よ。
        english: If you wear such strange clothes, you don't know what others will say.
        hint: This emphasizes the *consequences* of others' reactions. The original simply states the
          outcome (standing out) directly from the action of wearing.
    scene: A man warning his younger brother about his eccentric fashion choices before a casual gathering.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「つったら」 (a contracted form of 「と言ったら」) implies 'if you were to call such clothes...'
      or 'if you were to wear such clothes...'. The casualness of the abbreviation reflects the friendly
      but direct warning from a male speaker to his younger brother, emphasizing the blunt truth about
      standing out.
  - english: The teacher's coming, so be quiet! I've told you many times!
    japanese:

      quote), I've said it many times, haven't I!
    competing_grammar:

        english: The teacher's coming, so be quiet! I told you that before, didn't I?
        hint: This uses `つってた` to refer to a past instance of saying something. The original implies a
          current, repeated state of telling someone.
    scene: An older student scolding younger students for making too much noise in the hallway.
    register: casual

        english: I said I don't want to go, but I can't not go, can I?
        hint: This uses `つった` as a premise for a reluctant acceptance, highlighting a common real-life
          scenario. The original is a firm refusal.
    scene: A teenage girl vehemently refusing to attend a family gathering, speaking to her mother.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「つった でしょ」 is a very emphatic and slightly exasperated way of saying 「と言ったでしょう」, common in
      casual, frustrated female speech. The 「でしょ」 at the end seeks confirmation, implying "you know I
      said that, so why are you still pushing?"
  - english: The 'new product' they were talking about is actually just an updated version.
    japanese:
      - 『新 商品』{つ} の が、結局 マイナー チェンジ だっ た ん だ よ な。

    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「新 商品つのが」 is an extremely casual and slightly dismissive way of referring to something that
      was "called" or "said to be" a new product. 「つのが」 is a contracted form of 「というものが」, implying "that
      thing called...", often with a hint of irony or disappointment.
  - english: If you call that a 'plan', you're wrong.
    japanese:
      - あんな の『計画』{つ} ったら、笑わ れる よ。
      - それ『計画』{つ} ったら、みんな びっくり する よ。
      - その 案 を『計画』{つ} ったら、無理 が ある よ。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 『計画』{つ} って も、これ じゃあ 誰 も 納得 し ない だろ う な。
        english: Even if you call it a 'plan', no one will be convinced by this.
        hint: This uses `つっても` (a more emphatic 'even if you say') to challenge the validity of the label.
          The original warns of being laughed at for the labeling.
    scene: A university student scolding his friend's poor ideas.
    register: casual

      typical among close friends.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 努力 は『天才』{つ} って 呼ぶ に 値 する よ。
        english: His effort is worth calling 'genius'.
        hint: This example uses `つって呼ぶ` (call X Y) to affirm the label based on effort. The original uses
          `つうか` to correct a potential misunderstanding of the label.
    scene: A mentor explaining a successful person's true nature to a mentee.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「天才つうか」 is a very casual expression meaning "rather than calling him a genius" or "it's not
      so much a genius as...". It uses the `XというよりY` structure in a slangy, abbreviated form, often when
      the speaker is correcting a misconception. The 「か」 often implies clarification or an alternative
      perspective.
  - english: He said, 'I'm busy,' and left immediately.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は『忙しい』{つ} すぐ 帰っ て いっ た。
      - 『今日 は 忙しい』{つ} 席 を 立っ て しまっ た。
    english_literally: He, 'I'm busy' saying (abbreviated), immediately left.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は『忙しい』{つ} って 連絡 も なし に 帰っ た ん だ。
        english: He said 'I'm busy' and went home without contacting anyone.
        hint: This uses `つって` to convey the reported speech and then adds a negative action that follows.
          The original simply reports the statement and immediate departure.
    scene: Observing a person who quickly departed after stating their reason.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The direct use of 「忙しいつすぐ」 (short for 「忙しいと言ってすぐに」) indicates a quick, almost abrupt report
      of someone's words and subsequent action, emphasizing the swiftness or lack of elaborate explanation.
      This implies the speaker is simply relaying the sequence of events without embellishment.
  - english: Even if it's something called 'common sense', it might not be common sense in another country.
    japanese:
      - 『常識』{つ}った ところ で、他 の 国 で は 常識 じゃ ない こと も ある。
      - 『当たり前』{つ}った ところ で、人 に よっ て 違う ん だ よ ね。
    english_literally: '''Common sense'' (that is called), even if (it is said), in other countries, it
      might not be common sense.'
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 『常識』{つ}った から と いっ て、みんな が そう だ と は 限ら ない よ。
        english: Just because it's called 'common sense' doesn't mean everyone thinks so.
        hint: This uses `つったからといって` (just because you call it...) to challenge the universality of the
          concept. The original uses `つったところで` (even if you call it...) to state a general truth about
          cultural differences.
    scene: Discussing cultural differences in a relaxed conversation among friends.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    nuance: 「常識つった ところ で」 (from 「常識と言ったところで」) uses 「つった」 to frame "common sense" as a label or concept
      that might not hold universally. The casual abbreviation makes the observation feel more conversational
      and less formal, typically used when pointing out a discrepancy or challenging a general assumption.
post_example_writeup: Even though 「言う」 disappears when abbreviated to 「つ」, it is vital to remember that
  standard conjugation rules still apply. For instance, if you wish to convey past tense, you would use
  「つった」。 Similarly, for the progressive form, 「つってん」 is used, which is derived from 「言っている」 shortened
  to 「言ってん」.
