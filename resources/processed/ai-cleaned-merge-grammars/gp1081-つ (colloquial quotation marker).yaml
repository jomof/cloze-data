        "nuance": "Carries a very casual, often colloquial, and sometimes abrupt tone. It is an extreme abbreviation, signaling a relaxed and informal speech style. The variant 'っつ' may imply a slight pause or a frustrated tone, though this is not always the case."

    "etymology": "「つ」 originates from an abbreviation of 「という」. 「という」 is composed of the quotation particle 「と」 and the verb 「言う (いう)」 (to say). Over time, 「という」 was shortened to 「つ」 in very casual speech.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「つ」 is a highly abbreviated, slang form of 「という」. It is used to quote something that was previously stated, to refer to something that is known as (A), or to mention something that is called (A).\n\nFundamentally, 「という」 is a combination of the quotation particle 「と」 and the verb 「言う」 (to say). Due to 「と」 being a quotation particle, 「つ」 maintains the versatility to follow almost any word or statement, functioning as a flexible conversational connector.\n\nDespite being strong slang, 「つ」 is very common in modern Japanese, particularly in casual conversation among friends or peers. While native speakers often abbreviate 「という」 to varying degrees, 「つ」 represents the shortest possible form. Other common abbreviated forms include 「って」 and 「っつ」, and sometimes even 「つう」.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that even though the verb 「言う」 is omitted in 「つ」, the grammar point can still be conjugated. For instance, to express past tense, you would use 「つった」 (from 「言った」), and for the progressive form, 「つってん」 (from 「言っている」, abbreviated to 「言ってん」). Understanding these conjugated forms is essential for natural usage.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Both 'つ' and 'って' relate to quoting or mentioning something. However, 'つ' is a more direct and extreme abbreviation of 'という', specifically for a very casual and quick way of saying 'called' or 'said that'. 'って' is broader, functioning as a more general conversational particle that can also indicate means or method, not just direct quotation. When deciding between 'つ' and the full 'という', consider the level of formality and the desired degree of casualness; 'つ' is strictly for very informal contexts.",
