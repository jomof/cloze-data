        "spatial-flow": "Does not inherently indicate spatial flow. It is a conceptual limiter. Furthermore, it is generally used in contexts where there is no physical action being limited. For example, it would be unnatural to say, 「単に公園を歩く」 (to simply walk in the park) if the intention is only to state the action without emphasizing limitation. Use of 「単に」 here would suggest that walking in the park is the *only* thing being done, with no other purpose or activity."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「単に」 is formed from 「単 (tan)」 meaning 'simple' or 'single,' and 「に (ni)」, which functions as an adverbial marker. Thus, it literally means 'in a simple manner.' It conveys the idea of something being singular, uncomplicated, or merely what it appears to be, tracing its origin to the concept of 'singleness' or 'plainness.'",
    "writeup": "「単に (tan ni)」 is an adverb used to express that something is \"simply,\" \"merely,\" \"only,\" or \"just\" a particular state, condition, or action. It functions to limit or downplay the scope of what is being discussed, emphasizing that there are no additional complexities or hidden meanings.\n\nWhile 「単に」 shares a similar meaning with 「ただ」, 「単に」 often carries a slightly more formal or emphatic nuance. It is frequently employed when an explanation is given, clarifying that a situation is straightforward or that a particular outcome is due to a simple, singular cause rather than something more profound or complicated. It can also be used to indicate that something is \"nothing more than\" a certain thing, thereby reducing its significance.\n\nIt is commonly followed by forms like 「～だけ」 (just/only) or 「～に過ぎない」 (nothing more than), which further reinforce the limiting or emphasizing nature of 「単に」.",

            "nuance": "While 「ただ」 can also mean 'only' or 'just,' it is generally less formal than 「単に」 and can also mean 'free of charge,' a meaning which 「単に」 does not carry. 「ただ」 often has a softer, more conversational tone."

            "nuance": "「に過ぎない」 is an expression that, when combined with 「単に」, strongly emphasizes that something is insignificant, trivial, or nothing beyond what it appears. While it conveys a similar sense of limitation, it is a grammatical pattern rather than a standalone adverb like 「単に」."

            "nuance": "「～にしか～ない」 is a grammatical structure that explicitly states a strong limitation, conveying that something is 'only' or 'nothing but' a certain way. While 「単に」 often precedes this structure, 「～にしか～ない」 on its own emphasizes the negativity or insufficiency of the limited action or state, which is a stronger nuance than 「単に」 alone."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "「単に」, 「ただ」, and 「に過ぎない」 all convey a sense of limitation or simplicity, but their nuances and formality differ. 「単に」 is a direct and somewhat formal adverb emphasizing that something is straightforward or solely one thing. 「ただ」 is more casual and versatile, encompassing 'just' or 'only' but also 'free of charge'. 「に過ぎない」 is a concluding phrase that strongly asserts something is merely what it is, often implying insignificance, and works well in conjunction with 「単に」 to create a powerful limiting statement. 「～にしか～ない」 is another pattern that strongly limits the scope, often with a slightly negative connotation, emphasizing the inadequacy of what is present or occurring. While 「単に」 often precedes it for added emphasis, 「～にしか～ない」 itself inherently carries the nuance of \"only this much\" or \"nothing more than this.\"",
