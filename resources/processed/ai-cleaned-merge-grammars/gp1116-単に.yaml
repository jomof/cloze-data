        "nuance": "Implies that the situation is straightforward, uncomplicated, or that there are no deeper meanings or intentions than what is explicitly stated. Can sometimes carry a dismissive or reductive tone.",

        "temporal-flow": "Does not inherently indicate temporal flow, but can describe a state that is simply true at a given time.",
        "spatial-flow": "Does not inherently indicate spatial flow. It is a conceptual limiter. Furthermore, it is generally used in contexts where there is no physical action being limited. For example, it would be unnatural to say, 「単に公園を歩く」 (to simply walk in the park) if the intention is only to state the action without emphasizing limitation. Use of 「単に」 here would suggest that walking in the park is the *only* thing being done, with no other purpose or activity."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「単に」 is formed from 「単 (tan)」 meaning 'simple' or 'single,' and 「に (ni)」, which functions as an adverbial marker. Thus, it literally means 'in a simple manner.' It conveys the idea of something being singular, uncomplicated, or merely what it appears to be, tracing its origin to the concept of 'singleness' or 'plainness.'",
    "writeup": "「単に (tan ni)」 is an adverb used to express that something is \"simply,\" \"merely,\" \"only,\" or \"just\" a particular state, condition, or action. It functions to limit or downplay the scope of what is being discussed, emphasizing that there are no additional complexities or hidden meanings.\n\nWhile 「単に」 shares a similar meaning with 「ただ」, 「単に」 often carries a slightly more formal or emphatic nuance. It is frequently employed when an explanation is given, clarifying that a situation is straightforward or that a particular outcome is due to a simple, singular cause rather than something more profound or complicated. It can also be used to indicate that something is \"nothing more than\" a certain thing, thereby reducing its significance.\n\nIt is commonly followed by forms like 「～だけ」 (just/only) or 「～に過ぎない」 (nothing more than), which further reinforce the limiting or emphasizing nature of 「単に」.",
