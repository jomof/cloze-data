        "spatial-flow": "Does not inherently indicate spatial flow. It is a conceptual limiter. Furthermore, it is generally used in contexts where there is no physical action being limited. For example, it would be unnatural to say, 「単に公園を歩く」 to simply say "

    "etymology": "The word 「単に」 is formed from 「単 (tan)」 meaning 'simple' or 'single,' and 「に (ni)」, which functions as an adverbial marker. Thus, it literally means 'in a simple manner.' It conveys the idea of something being singular, uncomplicated, or merely what it appears to be, tracing its origin to the concept of 'singleness' or 'plainness.'",
    "writeup": "「単に (tan ni)」 is an adverb used to express that something is \"simply,\" \"merely,\" \"only,\" or \"just\" a particular state, condition, or action. It functions to limit or downplay the scope of what is being discussed, emphasizing that there are no additional complexities or hidden meanings.\n\nWhile 「単に」 shares a similar meaning with 「ただ」, 「単に」 often carries a slightly more formal or emphatic nuance. It is frequently employed when an explanation is given, clarifying that a situation is straightforward or that a particular outcome is due to a simple, singular cause rather than something more profound or complicated. It can also be used to indicate that something is \"nothing more than\" a certain thing, thereby reducing its significance.\n\nIt is commonly followed by forms like 「～だけ」 (just/only) or 「～に過ぎない」 (nothing more than), which further reinforce the limiting or emphasizing nature of 「単に」.",
