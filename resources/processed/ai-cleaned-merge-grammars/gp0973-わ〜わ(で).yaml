        "function": "Expresses multiple reasons or contributing factors for a specific outcome, often negative, by listing them emphatically.",

    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「わ」 is an emphatic version of the adverbial particle 「は」, originating from 「は」 changing to 「わ」. Its literal meaning can be thought of as a stronger version of the standard 'as for (A)' meaning of 「は」, emphasizing the preceding element as a contributing factor or origin.",
    "writeup": "As an emphatic particle, 「わ」 is commonly used to add stress or emphasis in Japanese. When used in the structure 「わ〜わ(で)」 after verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns in their standard forms, it generally implies that factor A and factor B are negative elements that have accumulated to lead to outcome C, where C is typically a negative outcome or opinion. It can often be translated as \"with A and B, C\" or \"because of A and B, C.\"\n\nTo construct this pattern, simply place 「わ」 after the first word, and then repeat it after a second (different) word. For な-adjectives or nouns, 「だわ」 is used instead. The case-marking particle 「で」 then follows the second 「わ」, functioning to indicate \"with\" or \"as a consequence of.\" The final 「で」 can occasionally be omitted.\n\nWhile similar to the basic emphatic particle 「わ」, 「わ〜わ(で)」 uniquely emphasizes the speaker's irritation or frustration due to an accumulation of multiple factors. Unlike instances where a single verb is repeated with 「わ」 to indicate excessive extent, 「わ〜わ(で)」 focuses on the combined impact of distinct, often undesirable, circumstances. This structure is predominantly used by men, but it may sometimes be used by women, particularly in more formal or assertive contexts. There are various usages of 「わ」 depending on its position in a sentence, each with its own gender-usage tendencies.\n\nIn essence, 「わ〜わ(で)」 functions much like 「し〜し」 (listing reasons), but with a heightened sense of emotional impact, particularly frustration or exasperation from the accumulated factors. While almost exclusively used with a negative nuance, it can, in rare cases, express overwhelming positive surprise or delight at an accumulation of good events, though this usage is less common.",
