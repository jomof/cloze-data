    "etymology": "The particle 「わ」 is an emphatic version of 「は」. The pattern 「わ〜わで」 strengthens this emphasis, listing multiple reasons to express surprise, irritation, or frustration.",
    "writeup": "The 「わ〜わで」 grammar point is used to express that two or more things are negative factors leading to a negative outcome or opinion. This structure emphasizes the speaker's surprise, irritation, or frustration regarding the mentioned factors. It is similar to 「し〜し」, where the listed items are presented as reasons for something. \n\nTo use this pattern, place 「わ」 after the first word and repeat it after a second (different) word. For な-adjectives or nouns, use 「だわ」. Follow the second 「わ」 with the case-marking particle 「で」, indicating \"with\" or \"as a consequence of.\" The 「で」 is sometimes omitted.\n\nWhile often used with a negative nuance, it can rarely express a positive sentiment. This structure is predominantly used by men, although women may use it as well.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「わ」 is an adverbial particle often used to emphasize a point. This grammar pattern is an extension of that, emphasizing multiple points.\n*   Be aware that there are several variations of 「わ」, each with its own nuances and usage tendencies.\n*   While generally negative, it can occasionally be used positively.",
