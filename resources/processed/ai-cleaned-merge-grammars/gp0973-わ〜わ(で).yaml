        "function": "Expresses multiple reasons or contributing factors for a specific outcome, often negative, by listing them emphatically.",

    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「わ」 is an emphatic version of the adverbial particle 「は」, originating from 「は」 changing to 「わ」. Its literal meaning can be thought of as a stronger version of the standard 'as for (A)' meaning of 「は」.",
    "writeup": "As a particle, 「わ」 is commonly used to add stress or emphasis in Japanese. When used after verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns in their standard forms, 「わ〜わ(で)」 generally implies that A and B are negative factors that have led to C, where C is either a negative outcome or a negative opinion. It will often be translated as \"with A and B, C\".\n\nTo use this structure, simply place 「わ」 after a word, and then repeat the same after a second (different) word. In the case of な-adjectives or nouns, 「だわ」 will be used. The case-marking particle 「で」 then follows the second 「わ」, indicating \"with\", or \"as a consequence of\".\n\n「わ〜わで」, like 「わ」, primarily emphasizes the speaker's surprise in regard to the words that appear before it. However, unlike 「わ」, where the same verb will be repeated in order to highlight an excessive extent, 「わ〜わで」 simply indicates surprise in terms of irritation or frustration. This structure is predominantly used by men, but it may sometimes be used by women. There are several different variations of 「わ」 depending on where they appear in sentences, each of which have gender usage tendencies that will need to be learned.\n\nIn essence, 「わ」 is used similarly to 「し〜し」, where the words they are attached to are listed as reasons. Additionally, the 「で」 may occasionally be omitted.\n\n**Important Considerations**\nWhile this grammar pattern is used almost exclusively with a negative nuance, it may, in rare cases, have a positive nuance. This positive usage, however, is less common and adds a sense of delightful accumulation, but the core meaning of listing contributing factors remains.",
