id: gp0414
meaning: famous for
pronunciation:
  katakana: デユウメイ
  romaji: de yūmei
formation:
  Noun + で + 有名: Indicates that someone or something is famous for a particular characteristic, skill,
    or reason (Noun).
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  function: To state the reason or aspect for which something or someone is famous.
  nuance: This pattern emphasizes the specific characteristic or attribute that leads to fame. It implies
    that the fame is directly attributable to the 'Noun' specified.
  colocation: Often used with nouns that represent specific traits, skills, or products.
  grammatical-role: Acts as a descriptive phrase modifying a subject. 'で' here functions as a particle
    indicating means, cause, or scope, similar to 'by means of' or 'because of'.
etymology: The particle 「で」 in this construction originally signifies 'by means of' or 'because of', indicating
  the cause or reason for something. When combined with 「有名」(yūmei, meaning 'famous'), it naturally evolved
  to express 'famous for' that specific thing or reason. This usage aligns with other instances of 「で」
  indicating a defining characteristic or method.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern 「〜で有名」(〜 de yūmei) is used to express that someone or something is famous **for** a particular attribute, skill, product, or characteristic. The noun placed before 「で」 is the specific reason for which the subject is known. This pattern explicitly links the fame to a concrete element or quality, highlighting what makes the person or thing stand out. For example, a city might be famous for its food, a person for their art, or a company for its innovative technology. This phrase is generally neutral in register and can be used in both formal and informal contexts to state a widely recognized fact.

  It's important to understand that the 「で」 here isn't indicating a location, but rather the 'means' or 'cause' of the fame. Think of it as 'famous _by means of_ X' or 'famous _because of_ X'.

  - term: で知られる (known for)
    meaning: To be known for; to be famous for (more emphasis on general recognition)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜で知られる」 is very similar to 「〜で有名」 but carries a slightly broader nuance of being 'known for'
      something, implying general recognition rather than necessarily widespread fame. It can be used
      for less universally famous things or people.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:で知られる (known for)
  - term: に関して有名 (famous regarding)
    meaning: Famous regarding; famous in connection with (implies a broader area of fame)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜で有名」 highlights the direct cause of fame, 「〜に関して有名」 suggests fame in a broader area
      or topic. For example, a professor might be famous for 'their research' (その研究で有名) or famous 'regarding
      space science' (宇宙科学に関して有名).
    grammar_point: に関する・に関して (related to regarding)
  - term: の名を持つ (to have the name)
    meaning: To have the name of; to be called (emphasizes the name itself)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜の名を持つ」 emphasizes possessing a specific name or title, not necessarily being famous for
      something. It focuses on the designation rather than the reason for recognition.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:名 を 持つ (to have the name)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「〜で知られる」 is often interchangeable with 「〜で有名」, it can be used for things
  that are known but not necessarily 'famous' in a grand sense. 「〜に関して有名」 is broader, indicating fame
  within a certain field or topic rather than for a specific attribute. 「〜の名を持つ」 is entirely different,
  simply stating that something possesses a certain name, without implying fame at all.

        hint: We're looking for what Kyoto is famous for, not just what name it holds. 「の名を持つ」 describes
