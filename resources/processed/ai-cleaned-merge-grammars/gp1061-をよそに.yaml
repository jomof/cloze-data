    "etymology": "「をよそに」 comes from 「余所 (yoso)」 meaning \"another place,\" combined with the particle 「に (ni)」. The 「を (o)」 here is an adverbial particle. So, the literal sense is akin to \"placing something in another place,\" implying disregard or setting something aside.",
    "writeup": "「をよそに」 is used to express that something (A) has effectively nothing to do with the speaker, or that the speaker is ignoring it in relation to something else (B). It can be translated as \"ignoring (A)\" or \"disregarding (A).\" It's a combination of the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「余所」 (other place), and the particle 「に」. Thus, the literal meaning is close to \"putting (A) completely aside, (B).\" This structure follows nouns or phrases nominalized with 「の」. It is reasonably formal and seen more often in writing.\n\nThe most common pattern is that (A) expresses some overall situation, while (B) indicates an action done without any thought or care given to those circumstances. Because of this, it's often used critically about actions seen as irresponsible.\n\n**Important Consideration:** This grammar point highlights the actions of people but is not used to refer to the speaker's own actions.",
