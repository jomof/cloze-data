    "etymology": "「をよそに」 comes from the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「余所(よそ)」 (other place), and the case-marking particle 「に」. The literal meaning is similar to \"putting (A) completely aside, (B).\"",
    "writeup": "「をよそに」 expresses that (A) is something the speaker is effectively ignoring in relation to something else. It can be translated as \"ignoring (A)\" or \"disregarding (A).\" It combines the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「余所」 (other place), and the case-marking particle 「に」. The literal meaning is close to \"putting (A) completely aside, (B).\" This structure follows nouns or phrases nominalized with 「の」. It is reasonably formal, often appearing in writing.\n\nThe most common pattern is (A) expressing an overall situation, while (B) indicates an action done without thought or care for those circumstances. Therefore, it's often used critically about actions seen as irresponsible.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   This grammar point primarily highlights the actions of people and is generally not used to describe the speaker's own actions.",
