    "etymology": "「をよそに」 comes from the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「余所(よそ)」 (other place), and the case-marking particle 「に」. The literal meaning is similar to \"putting (A) completely aside, (B).\"",
    "writeup": "「をよそに」 expresses that an external situation (A) is disregarded or ignored by an actor (B). It can be translated as \"ignoring (A),\" \"disregarding (A),\" or \"despite (A).\" This grammar point combines the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「余所 (よそ)」 (other place), and the case-marking particle 「に」. Its literal meaning is akin to \"putting (A) completely aside, (B).\" This structure follows nouns or phrases nominalized with 「の」. It is a relatively formal expression, frequently encountered in written Japanese.\n\nThe most common usage pattern for 「をよそに」 is when (A) describes an overall circumstance or expectation, and (B) indicates an action taken without consideration or regard for those circumstances. Consequently, it often carries a critical tone, implying that the actor's actions are irresponsible or self-centered.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「をよそに」 is primarily used to highlight the actions of others; it is generally not used to describe the speaker's own actions.\n*   While often used critically, it can sometimes describe a situation where an outcome occurs \"despite\" an external factor, without necessarily implying irresponsibility, though this usage is less common.",

            "term": "~を無視して",
            "meaning": "Ignoring; disregarding (more direct)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「をよそに」 implies a deeper, often critical disregard by proceeding as if something doesn't exist, 「〜を無視して」 is a more direct and neutral way to state that something was ignored. It doesn't necessarily carry the same nuance of irresponsibility."
        },
        {
            "term": "~にもかかわらず",
            "meaning": "Despite; regardless of",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「〜にもかかわらず」 simply states a factual contrast or opposition, meaning 'even though X, Y happened.' It does not carry the critical implication of wilful disregard or irresponsible action that 「をよそに」 often does. It is more objective."

        {
            "term": "~を顧みず",
            "meaning": "Without regard for; not caring about (more literary/stronger)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「〜を顧みず」 is a more formal and literary expression that emphasizes a lack of consideration, often for something that should be important or morally considered. It implies a stronger, more deliberate neglect than 「をよそに」 and can apply to self-sacrifice or recklessness."

            "term": "~をものともせず",
            "meaning": "Defying; not caring about; overcoming (a difficulty)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「をよそに」, which often carries a negative or critical nuance of disregarding something, 「〜をものともせず」 usually implies a positive connotation of overcoming a difficult situation or defying obstacles with courage and resilience. It suggests strength rather than irresponsibility."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While the expressions above can sometimes translate similarly to 「をよそに」, it is crucial to understand their distinct nuances. 「を無視して」 is a straightforward statement of ignoring. 「にもかかわらず」 simply expresses a factual 'despite' without conveying a judgmental tone. 「を顧みず」 is a more emphatic and often literary way to say 'without regard for', implying a deeper neglect. 「をものともせず」 uniquely highlights overcoming obstacles, presenting a positive rather than critical implication. Choose 「をよそに」 when you want to convey a sense of a person or entity acting irresponsibly or selfishly by knowingly disregarding external circumstances, advice, or concerns.",
