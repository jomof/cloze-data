    "etymology": "「をよそに」 comes from the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「余所(よそ)」 (other place), and the case-marking particle 「に」. The literal meaning is similar to \"putting (A) completely aside, (B).\"",
    "writeup": "「をよそに」 expresses that an external situation (A) is disregarded or ignored by an actor (B). It can be translated as \"ignoring (A),\" \"disregarding (A),\" or \"despite (A).\" This grammar point combines the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「余所 (よそ)」 (other place), and the case-marking particle 「に」. Its literal meaning is akin to \"putting (A) completely aside, (B).\" This structure follows nouns or phrases nominalized with 「の」. It is a relatively formal expression, frequently encountered in written Japanese.\n\nThe most common usage pattern for 「をよそに」 is when (A) describes an overall circumstance or expectation, and (B) indicates an action taken without consideration or regard for those circumstances. Consequently, it often carries a critical tone, implying that the actor's actions are irresponsible or self-centered.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「をよそに」 is primarily used to highlight the actions of others; it is generally not used to describe the speaker's own actions.\n*   While often used critically, it can sometimes describe a situation where an outcome occurs \"despite\" an external factor, without necessarily implying irresponsibility, though this usage is less common.",
