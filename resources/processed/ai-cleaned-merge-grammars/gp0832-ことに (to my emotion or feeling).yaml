details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: general
etymology: The grammar point ことに is derived from the noun 事 (koto) meaning 'thing' or 'matter,' combined
  with the particle に (ni). The combination emphasizes the degree or extent of something, typically related
  to a feeling or emotion. In essence, it highlights the matter or thing that evokes a particular feeling.
writeup: ことに is used to express a strong feeling or subjective judgment about a situation. It's often
  translated as "especially," "particularly," or "to my [feeling]." It emphasizes the extent to which
  something evokes a particular emotion.It typically follows verbs, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives. For
  example, 嬉しい こと に (ureshii koto ni) means "I am especially happy that...". 幸い な こと に (saiwai na koto
  ni) is a common set phrase that means "fortunately" or "luckily." This phrase itself uses the ことに structure.In
  some cases, ことに may appear before the description it modifies, functioning similarly to 特に (tokuni)
  to mean "particularly" or "especially".

  - term: そうにない
    meaning: Unlikely to, Showing no signs of
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike ことに, そうにない expresses a lack of probability or indication, not a feeling or subjective
      judgment.
    grammar_point: そうにない (unlikely to)
  - term: てしょうがない
    meaning: Extremely, Very, Really, It can't be helped
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While てしょうがない also indicates a strong feeling or degree, it implies an uncontrollable or unbearable
      state, unlike ことに which simply expresses the emotion or judgment without necessarily implying uncontrollability.
    grammar_point: てしょうがない (cannot help but)
  - term: てたまらない
    meaning: Can't help but want to, Very, Extremely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: てたまらない expresses an overwhelming, often uncontrollable, urge or feeling, implying that one
      'cannot bear' the intensity. ことに is a more general expression of emotion or judgment, less focused
      on an unbearable state.
    grammar_point: てたまらない (unbearably extremely)
  - term: てならない
    meaning: Uncontrollable feeling
    kind: synonym
    nuance: てならない also indicates a strong, often natural or spontaneous, feeling that one 'can't help
      but feel'. While similar to ことに in expressing intensity, ことに focuses on the subjective judgment
      or observation about a situation rather than an internal, uncontrollable urge.
    grammar_point: てならない (uncontrollable feeling)
  - term: 特に
    meaning: Especially; particularly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike ことに, 特に is a neutral adverb used for general emphasis without conveying a subjective
      emotional impact or judgment about the situation itself.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:特に (especially)
  - term: あまりに
    meaning: Excessively, too much
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike ことに, あまりに is a general intensifier for degree or quantity, not specifically for emotions
      or subjective judgments.
    grammar_point: あまりに (excessively・too much)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that ことに always expresses an emotion or subjective
  judgment related to a situation. When you want to simply state a fact or describe something without
  expressing a personal feeling or strong subjective judgment, avoid using ことに. Instead, use adverbs like
  特に (tokuni) or 非常に (hijouni) for emphasis, or other grammar points that don't carry emotional connotations.
  It is important to recognize that the meaning warning restricts ことに to only refer to feelings.
examples:
  - english: Happily, it cleared up today.
    japanese:
      - 嬉しい こと に、今日 は 晴れ まし た。
      - 嬉しい こと に、今日 は 晴れ た。
    english_literally: To my happy thing, today cleared up.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 晴れ て 嬉しい です。
        english: I am happy that it cleared up today.
        hint: 嬉しいです expresses your personal happiness. ことに emphasizes that the situation itself is a cause
          for the emotion. We're looking for an expression that highlights the fortunate nature of the
          situation.
    scene: A person expresses relief and happiness about the weather changing for the better after a gloomy
      period.
    register: casual
    setting: optimistic
    nuance: The use of 嬉しいことに highlights that the good weather is a source of joy or relief for the speaker,
      emphasizing the subjective emotional impact rather than merely stating a fact.
    etymology: The phrase 嬉しいことに is formed by combining the i-adjective 嬉しい (happy) with ことに. This construction
      effectively transforms the subjective feeling of happiness into an objective statement about the
      situation, implying that it is fortunate or delightful that something occurred. This mechanism of
      taking a feeling and framing it as an attribute of the circumstance is a key aspect of ことに's function,
      allowing for a nuanced expression of emotion tied to external events rather than just internal states.
      For example, 嬉しい (happy) is derived from 憂し (ushi), which originally meant 'sad' or 'grief'. Over
      time, its meaning shifted to indicate the opposite, especially in connection with the feeling of
      relief from sorrow or trouble, thus becoming 'happy' or 'pleasing'. This evolution reinforces the
      idea of 嬉しいことに as expressing a positive turn of events.
  - english: Regrettably, he lost the match.
    japanese:
      - 残念 な こと に、彼 は 試合 に 負け まし た。
      - 残念 な こと に、彼 は 試合 に 負け た。
      - 残念 な こと に、彼 は 試合 に 敗れ まし た。
    english_literally: To the regrettable thing, he lost the match.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 試合 に 負け て 残念 です。
        english: I am regrettable that he lost the match.
        hint: 残念です expresses your personal feeling of regret. ことに emphasizes that the situation itself
          is regrettable. We're looking for an expression that presents the loss as an unfortunate fact.
    scene: A coach is discussing the outcome of a recent sports match with their team.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The phrase 残念なことに allows the speaker to express regret in a formal and somewhat detached manner,
      conveying that the situation itself is regrettable, rather than solely focusing on their personal
      sadness. This makes it appropriate for a coach addressing a team.
    etymology: The use of 残念なことに originates from the word 残念 (zannen), which literally means 'regret'
      or 'disappointment'. When combined with ことに, it shifts the focus from a personal feeling of regret
      to the objective unfortunate nature of the event itself. This phrasing implies that the situation
      is regrettable from a broader, perhaps shared, perspective, rather than just the speaker's personal
      sentiment. This is why it works well in formal or objective contexts like a coach addressing a team.
  - english: To my surprise, she suddenly quit the company.
    japanese:
      - 驚い た こと に、彼女 は 突然 会社 を 辞め まし た。
      - 驚い た こと に、彼女 は 突然 会社 を 辞め た。
      - 驚い た こと に、彼女 は 突然 会社 を 辞め て しまい まし た。
    english_literally: To the surprised thing, she suddenly quit the company.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 が 突然 会社 を 辞め た の は 驚き です。
        english: Her suddenly quitting the company was a surprise.
        hint: 驚きです treats the event as a noun, a surprise. ことに focuses on the feeling of being surprised
          by the event. We're looking for an expression that directly ties the feeling of surprise to
          the action.
    scene: Colleagues are discussing unexpected news about a former co-worker at a casual gathering.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: By using 驚いたことに, the speaker emphasizes their personal reaction of surprise to the news. The
      past tense of the verb 驚く (to be surprised) clearly links the feeling to the completed action.
    etymology: The verb 驚く (odoroku), meaning 'to be surprised' or 'to be astonished', is used here in
      its past tense, indicating a completed state of surprise. When combined with ことに, it highlights
      the fact that the sudden quitting was an actual event that caused surprise, making the surprise
      an inherent quality of the situation. This construction emphasizes the impact of the event on the
      speaker's emotional state, almost as if saying "the surprising aspect of the matter is that..."
  - english: Sadly, my cat has fallen ill.
    japanese:
      - 悲しい こと に、猫 が 病気 に なっ て しまい まし た。
      - 悲しい こと に、猫 が 病気 に なっ て しまっ た。
      - 悲しい こと に、愛 猫 が 病気 に なっ て しまい まし た。
    english_literally: To the sad thing, my cat has become ill.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 猫 が 病気 に なっ て 悲しい です。
        english: I am sad that my cat has fallen ill.
        hint: 悲しいです expresses your personal sadness. ことに emphasizes that the situation itself is sad.
          We're looking for an expression that presents the illness as an unfortunate reality.
    scene: A young girl tells her parent about her beloved pet's sudden illness.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 悲しいことに conveys a sense of unfortunate reality, making the sadness feel more objective
      and universally regrettable. This is a common way for a younger speaker to express sorrow to an
      older family member, seeking shared understanding rather than just personal commiseration.
    etymology: The i-adjective 悲しい (kanashii), meaning 'sad' or 'sorrowful', combined with ことに, objectifies
      the sadness, making it a characteristic of the situation rather than solely an internal feeling.
      This framing is particularly effective when conveying a shared sense of unfortunate reality, as
      seen in a child expressing sorrow about a pet. The word 悲しい itself stems from ancient Japanese,
      often associated with concepts of lamentation and grief, reinforcing its deep emotional connotation.
  - english: The problem is, my computer stopped working.
    japanese:
      - 困っ た こと に、パソコン が 動か なく なり まし た。
      - 困っ た こと に、パソコン が 動か なく なっ た。
      - 困っ た こと に、パソコン が 動か なく なっ ちゃっ た。
    english_literally: To the troubled thing, my computer stopped working.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - パソコン が 動か なく なっ て 困っ て い ます。
        english: My computer stopped working, and I am troubled.
        hint: 困っています expresses your current troubled state. ことに highlights that the situation itself is
          troublesome. We're looking for an expression that states the predicament as an inherent problem.
    scene: A student struggling with their computer the night before a major assignment is due.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: Using 困ったことに presents the malfunctioning computer as an inherent problem, creating a sense
      of resignation or frustration with the situation itself. It conveys 'the troubling thing is that...'
      rather than 'I am troubled because...'. The past tense of the verb 困る (to be troubled/bothered)
      connects the feeling directly to the finished action.
    etymology: The verb 困る (komaru), meaning 'to be troubled' or 'to be in difficulty', is used in its
      past tense, indicating a state of being troubled that has come about. When paired with ことに, it transforms
      the personal feeling of being troubled into an objective statement about the problematic nature
      of the situation. This creates a nuance of 'the troublesome truth is that...' or 'it is an unfortunate
      situation that...', emphasizing the inherent difficulty of the circumstances rather than merely
      the speaker's reaction.
  - english: Fortunately, my lost item was found.
    japanese:
      - 幸い な こと に、忘れ物 が 見つかり まし た。
      - 幸い な こと に、忘れ物 が 見つかっ た。
      - 幸い な こと に、落とし物 が 発見 さ れ まし た。
    english_literally: To the fortunate thing, my lost item was found.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 忘れ物 が 見つかっ て 良かっ た です。
        english: It was good that my lost item was found.
        hint: 良かったです expresses a general positive feeling about the outcome. ことに emphasizes the fortuitous
          nature of the situation. We're looking for an expression that conveys a sense of good luck or
          fortune.
    scene: A person expresses relief after recovering a forgotten item, perhaps a wallet or keys.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: optimistic
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 幸いなことに is a common, slightly more formal way to express good fortune, emphasizing
      that the positive outcome was a matter of luck or good circumstance. This gives a sense of relief
      and gratitude, commonly expressed by both genders.
    etymology: The word 幸い (saiwai), meaning 'happiness' or 'good fortune', when used with ことに, highlights
      that the circumstance itself is fortunate. It implies a sense of relief and appreciation for a positive
      outcome that might have been unexpected or difficult. The etymology of 幸い is linked to concepts
      of divine favor or good omens, further emphasizing the idea of a blessing or fortunate event.
  - english: Worryingly, the train was delayed due to the snow.
    japanese:
      - 心配 な こと に、雪 の せい で 電車 が 遅れ まし た。
      - 心配 な こと に、雪 の せい で 電車 が 遅れ た。
      - 心配 な こと に、積雪 の 影響 で 電車 が 遅延 いたし まし た。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雪 の せい で 電車 が 遅れ て 心配 し て い ます。
        english: The train was delayed due to snow, and I am worried.
        hint: 心配しています expresses your personal state of worry. ことに indicates that the situation itself
          is cause for worry. We're looking for an expression that objectively states the worrying nature
          of the event.
    scene: A commuter checking the train status on a snowy morning, worried about being late for work.
    register: formal
    setting: cautious
    nuance: 心配なことに frames the delay as an objectively worrying situation, emphasizing the inherent problematic
      nature of the event rather than just the speaker's personal anxiety. This can be used in more formal
      or informative contexts.
    etymology: The na-adjective 心配 (shinpai), meaning 'worry' or 'concern', combined with ことに, frames
      the train delay as an objectively worrying situation. It externalizes the worry, making it an attribute
      of the event itself rather than solely the speaker's internal state. This is useful in formal contexts
      to present a problem as a matter of general concern. The term 心配 itself is a Sino-Japanese word,
      originally referring to the 'heart' (心) being 'tied up' (配), illustrating the feeling of being bound
      by anxiety.

        english: It was surprising that the always quiet student spoke up in class.
        hint: びっくりです is a more casual and direct expression of surprise. ことに emphasizes the element of
          surprise connected to the event itself, often implying a deeper or more significant unexpectedness.
          We're looking for an expression that highlights the unexpected nature of the student's action.
    scene: A teacher recounts an unexpected moment in class to a colleague.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Using 驚くことに implies that the speaker (the teacher) found the event truly unexpected and noteworthy,
      highlighting the surprising aspect of the student's action rather than just a momentary shock. This
      structure adds a slight formal tone suitable for sharing observations.
    etymology: The verb 驚く (odoroku), meaning 'to be surprised' or 'to be astonished', when used with
      ことに, points to the surprising nature of the event. It elevates the surprise to a more significant
      observation about the situation. The term has roots in words related to sudden movement or sound,
      reflecting the unexpected jolt that surprise brings.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 財布 を 家 に 忘れ て き て しまっ て 恥ずかしい です。
        english: I forgot my wallet at home, and I am embarrassed.
        hint: 恥ずかしいです directly expresses personal embarrassment. ことに emphasizes that the situation itself
          is embarrassing. We're looking for an expression that frames the act of forgetting as an embarrassing
          incident.
    scene: A person at the register realizing they left their wallet at home.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    nuance: By saying 恥ずかしいことに, the speaker acknowledges the inherent embarrassment of the situation (forgetting
      the wallet) as a general truth, often used when expressing regret or making an apology. It's a mild
      way of saying 'the embarrassing truth is...'.
    etymology: The i-adjective 恥ずかしい (hazukashii), meaning 'embarrassing' or 'ashamed', when combined
      with ことに, objectifies the feeling of embarrassment. This means the situation itself is framed as
      embarrassing, rather than just the speaker feeling embarrassed. This construction is commonly used
      when someone needs to acknowledge an awkward situation gracefully or apologetically. The root of
      恥 (haji) relates to shame and disgrace, conveying a strong sense of social discomfort.
  - english: To my delight, the long-awaited game was released today.
    japanese:
      - 嬉しい こと に、今日 は 待ち望ん で い た ゲーム が 発売 さ れ まし た。

          - 待ち望ん で い た ゲーム が 発売 さ れ て 嬉しい です。
        english: I am happy that the long-awaited game was released.
        hint: 嬉しいです states personal happiness directly. ことに expresses that the event itself is a cause
          for joy. We're looking for an expression that highlights the joyful nature of the game's release.
    scene: A gamer excitedly tells their friend about a new game release.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 嬉しいことに is used here to convey the speaker's strong positive feeling about the game's release,
      making it clear that this event is a source of joy for them. It adds a sense of personal excitement
      and satisfaction. The use of 待ち望んでいた (long-awaited) further emphasizes the intensity of the feeling.
    etymology: This example uses 嬉しいことに again, emphasizing the joyful aspect of the game release as an
      objective fact. The repetition of this structure for different positive emotions (like in the first
      example) highlights its versatility for framing a situation as inherently pleasant or fortunate.
      The phrase 待ちに待った (machinimatta) reinforces the long anticipation, intensifying the feeling of delight.
post_example_writeup: Remember that ことに is primarily used to express emotions or subjective judgments,
  often implying a strong degree of that emotion. While it can translate to "especially" or "particularly,"
  it's crucial that the context involves a feeling or subjective judgment.
