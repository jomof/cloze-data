    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことに」 is derived from the noun 「事 (koto)」 meaning 'thing' or 'matter,' combined with the particle 「に (ni)」. The combination emphasizes the degree or extent of something, typically related to a feeling or emotion. In essence, it highlights the *matter* or *thing* that evokes a particular feeling.",
    "writeup": "「ことに」 is used to express a strong feeling or subjective judgment about a situation. It's often translated as \"especially,\" \"particularly,\" or \"to my [feeling].\" It emphasizes the extent to which something evokes a particular emotion.It typically follows verbs, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives. For example, 「嬉しいことに」 (ureshii koto ni) means \"I am especially happy that...\".「幸いなことに」 (saiwai na koto ni) is a common set phrase that means \"fortunately\" or \"luckily.\" This phrase itself uses the 「ことに」 structure.In some cases, 「ことに」 may appear before the description it modifies, functioning similarly to 「特に」 (tokuni) to mean \"particularly\" or \"especially\".",

Instead, use adverbs like 「特に (tokuni)」 or 「非常に (hijouni)」 for emphasis, or other grammar points that don't carry emotional connotations.
