    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ということは」 is composed of 「という」 (a way of saying), 「こと」 (a thing or matter), and 「は」 (the topic marker). Literally, it means \"as for the thing that is said,\" implying a connection or consequence related to the stated thing.",
    "writeup": "「ということは」 is a highly versatile phrase used to indicate that a preceding statement leads to a certain conclusion, understanding, or implication. It can be translated as \"that means,\" \"that is to say,\" or \"so you mean to say.\"\n\n**Usage Patterns:**\n*   **Introducing a Clarification or Implication:** When used in the middle of a sentence, 「ということは」 introduces a clarification or a logical implication of the preceding statement. The sentence may often conclude with 「ということだ」 or a similar form, reinforcing the conclusion, but this ending is not strictly necessary.\n*   **Seeking Confirmation or Clarification:** Placed at the beginning of a sentence, 「ということは」 is commonly used to seek confirmation or clarification about something that has just been said. In this context, it often takes the form of a question, effectively asking, \"So, are you saying that...?\" or \"Does that mean...?\"\n\nEssentially, 「ということは」 functions by taking a given statement (A) and using it as a basis to present a logical consequence or interpretation (B). It highlights the *meaning* or *implication* of what was previously stated.",
