    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ということは」 is composed of 「という」 (a way of saying), 「こと」 (a thing or matter), and 「は」 (the topic marker). Literally, it means \"as for the thing that is said,\" implying a connection or consequence related to the stated thing.",
    "writeup": "「ということは」 is a highly versatile phrase used to indicate that a preceding statement leads to a certain conclusion, understanding, or implication. It can be translated as \"that means,\" \"that is to say,\" or \"so you mean to say.\"\n\n**Usage Patterns:**\n*   **Introducing a Clarification or Implication:** When used in the middle of a sentence, 「ということは」 introduces a clarification or a logical implication of the preceding statement. The sentence may often conclude with 「ということだ」 or a similar form, reinforcing the conclusion, but this ending is not strictly necessary.\n*   **Seeking Confirmation or Clarification:** Placed at the beginning of a sentence, 「ということは」 is commonly used to seek confirmation or clarification about something that has just been said. In this context, it often takes the form of a question, effectively asking, \"So, are you saying that...?\" or \"Does that mean...?\"\n\nEssentially, 「ということは」 functions by taking a given statement (A) and using it as a basis to present a logical consequence or interpretation (B). It highlights the *meaning* or *implication* of what was previously stated.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「ということは」, which implies a conclusion or consequence, 「というのは」 is often used to introduce a definition, explanation, or the reason behind a statement. It focuses on providing clarification about something already mentioned."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ということ」 functions primarily as a nominalizer, converting a clause or statement into a noun phrase. While 「ということは」 includes 「ということ」, the addition of 「は」 shifts its function to expressing inference or confirmation, drawing a conclusion from a prior statement, which plain 「ということ」 does not."

            "nuance": "「つまり」 is used to summarize, simplify, or rephrase a previous statement in a more concise way. While similar in conveying clarification, 「ということは」 suggests a logical deduction or an implication derived from the prior statement, rather than just a summary."

        {

            "meaning": "In other words, That is, Namely",

            "nuance": "「即ち」 is a more formal and somewhat archaic way of saying \"in other words,\" used to rephrase something for clarity, often in written or highly formal contexts. It implies equivalence, whereas 「ということは」 implies a logical consequence or understanding from a preceding statement."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate these expressions, consider the specific function and context. Use 「ということは」 when you want to indicate that something logically implies something else or to confirm an understanding. Use 「というのは」 when defining or explaining a term or concept. Use 「つまり」 or 「即ち」 to summarize or rephrase for conciseness. Use 「ということ」 primarily as a nominalizer, and 「ことなの」 for emphatic or explanatory purposes, often seeking or providing a definition or reason.",
