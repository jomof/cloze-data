    "etymology": "じゃないか is formed from the negative form of the copula だ (ja-nai) plus the question particle か (ka). It literally translates to \"is it not?\"",
    "writeup": "When learning じゃない and ではない, you learned that these constructions are often partnered with the particle か to form a question. じゃないか can be attached to the end of almost any phrase to indicate a question, like finishing a sentence with \"isn't it?\" in English.\n\nWhen じゃないか is too casual, ではないか can be used instead, which is more formal but may sound stiff at times. Thus, it's best used when politeness is expected.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   The phrase 「～んじゃない」is often used in casual speech.",
