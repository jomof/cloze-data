        "usage-context": "General use to seek confirmation, express a suggestion, or voice a rhetorical question."
    },
    "etymology": "じゃないか is derived from the negative form of the copula だ (ja nai) followed by the question particle か (ka). The copula だ indicates affirmation or identification, its negative form ではない (or its casual contraction じゃない) means \"is not.\" Adding か turns this into a question, giving it the nuance of seeking agreement or making a rhetorical observation.",
    "writeup": "The expression じゃないか, often translated as \"Isn't it?\" or \"Right?\", is a versatile phrase used in casual Japanese. It combines the negative form of the copula, じゃない (casual contraction of ではない), with the interrogative particle か. While literally meaning \"is not?\", its function extends beyond a simple negative question. It is primarily used to seek confirmation, express a suggestion, or pose a rhetorical question, often implying that the speaker believes the listener will agree or already knows the fact. When used in a slightly rising intonation, it asks for agreement. With a falling intonation, it can express a strong assertion, an observation, or even a mild admonition. For a more formal or polite tone, ではないか is used. However, ではないか can sound somewhat stiff or academic, making it more suitable for formal discussions, presentations, or written contexts.",
