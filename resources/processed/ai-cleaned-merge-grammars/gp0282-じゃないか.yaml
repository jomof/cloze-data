        "[Phrase] + じゃないか": "Indicates a question or a suggestion with a degree of casualness. Similar to asking \"isn't it?\" in English."

        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "General use to seek confirmation, express a suggestion, or voice a rhetorical question."
    },
    "etymology": "じゃないか is derived from the negative form of the copula だ (ja nai) followed by the question particle か (ka). The copula だ indicates affirmation or identification, its negative form ではない (or its casual contraction じゃない) means \"is not.\" Adding か turns this into a question.",
    "writeup": "When learning じゃない and ではない, it was mentioned that these constructions are regularly partnered with the particle か to form a question. じゃないか can be attached to the end of almost any phrase to indicate a question, similar to finishing a sentence with \"isn't it?\" in English. When じゃないか is too casual, ではないか is used instead. However, ではないか can sound a bit stiff, so it's best used when politeness is expected. じゃないか is generally used to seek confirmation, express a suggestion, or voice a rhetorical question.",
