        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "function": "Connects two sentences or clauses, similar to \"and\" in English.",
        "nuance": "Indicates a sequence of events or an addition of information. It can also imply a cause-and-effect relationship."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「そして」 is derived from the verb 「そうする」 (sou suru), meaning \"to do so\" or \"to act in that way.\" Over time, it evolved into a conjunction to connect related actions or ideas.",
    "writeup": "「そして」 is a conjunction used to connect two sentences or clauses. It is similar to \"and\" or \"and then\" in English. It indicates a sequence of events or an addition of information. It can also imply a cause-and-effect relationship between the two parts of the sentence. While 「そして」 and 「それから」 are similar, 「そして」 often has a slightly stronger sense of consequence or continuation. It is important to note that 「そして」 and 「そうして」 are generally interchangeable. However, if 「そうして」 is used in its original sense of \"by doing so\" (i.e., performing an action that causes a subsequent event), it cannot be replaced by 「そして」. This distinction highlights the etymological root of 「そして」 from 「そうする」 (to do so).",
