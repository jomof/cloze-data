    "etymology": "The word 「たちまち」 originally comes from the kanji structure 「忽ち」, with the kanji itself meaning 'without thought'. This nuance is kept with 「たちまち」, as all actions associated with the word indicate a lack of planning or thought before happening. Despite this, the kanji itself is rarely used in modern writing.",
    "writeup": "「たちまち」 is an adverb that conveys the feeling of something happening suddenly or in a flash. The primary nuance is that it indicates something happened spontaneously, without being controlled. Often, 「たちまち」 indicates something entering a new, ongoing state or being completed. It frequently appears directly before the verb phrase it describes as being the new state.\n\nAs mentioned in the etymology, 「たちまち」 originally derives from 「忽ち」, meaning \"without thought,\" which underscores its sense of spontaneity. Despite this origin, the kanji form is rarely used in contemporary Japanese.",

Reason: Rephrased the Japanese sentence from '有名 な 本 は、本棚 に 並べられた とたん に、{たちまち} 売り切れた。' to 'その 有名 な 本 は、店 に 並べられる と {たちまち} 売り切れた。' to remove the N1 kanji `途端` (とたん) and ensure all kanji used are N2 level or lower, as required by the rule 'Example sentences should use kanji appropriate for the JLPT level of the grammar point.'"
