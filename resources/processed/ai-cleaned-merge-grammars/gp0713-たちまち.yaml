        "usage-context": "Used to describe events that occur rapidly and often spontaneously, without deliberate control.",
        "function": "To emphasize the swiftness or instantaneous nature of an action or change.",
        "nuance": "Implies a sudden, often uncontrollable, and spontaneous transition to a new state or the completion of an action. It can describe a quick shift from one state to another or an instantaneous outcome.",

    },
    "etymology": "The word 「たちまち」 originally comes from the kanji structure 「忽ち」, with the kanji itself meaning 'without thought'. This nuance is kept with 「たちまち」, as all actions associated with the word indicate a lack of planning or thought before happening. Despite this, the kanji itself is rarely used in modern writing.",
    "writeup": "「たちまち」 is an adverb used to convey the feeling of something happening 'suddenly' or 'in a flash'. The primary nuance with 「たちまち」, compared to other similar structures, is that it indicates something happened spontaneously and was not able to be controlled. In many cases, 「たちまち」 will indicate something entering a new, ongoing state, or something being completed. It often appears directly before the verb phrase it describes as being the new state.\n\nHistorically, 「たちまち」 originates from the kanji 「忽ち」 (忽 meaning 'without thought'). This etymology reinforces the nuance of spontaneity, as actions described by 「たちまち」 are often unplanned or occur without conscious effort. While the kanji itself is rarely seen in contemporary writing, its underlying meaning persists in the adverb's usage.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「たちまち」, 「直ちに」 often implies a more formal, urgent, or immediate response that requires action or happens without delay. It lacks the spontaneous or uncontrollable nuance of 「たちまち」."

            "nuance": "Unlike 「たちまち」, 「いきなり」 suggests something abrupt, unexpected, and often without prior warning or apparent reason. While both imply suddenness, 「いきなり」 focuses on the surprise of the event, whereas 「たちまち」 emphasizes the swiftness of the resulting change or new state."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate these expressions, remember that 「たちまち」 highlights the speed and often spontaneous nature of a change or transition to a new state. 「直ちに」 suggests a formal or urgent immediacy. 「いつの間にか」 focuses on a change that occurred without the speaker's notice. 「いきなり」 denotes an abrupt and unexpected event.",
