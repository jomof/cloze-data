details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  usage-context: 一般
etymology: This grammar point is built upon the structure 「わけにはいかない」 (wake ni wa ikanai), meaning "cannot
  afford to" or "no way to." The addition of 「ない」 before 「わけにはいかない」 creates a double negative, emphasizing
  the necessity or inevitability of the action. The literal sense is akin to "there's no reason why (A)
  can't be done," conveying a strong sense of obligation or lack of alternatives.
writeup: 「ないわけにはいかない」 is used to express that something must be done, that there's "no way to avoid" doing
  it. It builds upon the grammar pattern 「わけにはいかない」, which means "can't afford to do." By negating the
  「わけにはいかない」 part, it creates a double negative, emphasizing the necessity. Compared to similar structures
  like 「なければならない」 or 「ないといけない」, 「ないわけにはいかない」 often implies there are specific circumstances necessitating
  the action, frequently used to provide an excuse or justification.

    meaning: must do, have to do (colloquial)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ないといけない」 is a more colloquial way to express obligation, similar to 「なければならない」, but lacks
      the specific sense of inevitability or 'cannot not do' that 「ないわけにはいかない」 conveys due to compelling
      reasons.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ないといけない (must do, have to do colloquial)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key to distinguishing 「ないわけにはいかない」 from similar expressions lies in recognizing
  its specific nuance of obligation or inevitability due to circumstances. Consider whether the situation
  involves a lack of choice due to external factors versus an internal feeling or desire. Is it that you
  must do something, or that you want to do something?

          - 打ち合わせ を する 必要 が ある
        english: There is a need to have a meeting.
        hint: This states necessity but doesn't convey the reluctance or external pressure as strongly

          due to compelling reasons.

    nuance: The phrase 「面倒 だから」 highlights the speaker's reluctance, but 「し ない わけ に は いかない」 emphasizes

      tone with an older female colleague.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 行く 必要 が ある
        english: There is a need to go.
        hint: This states necessity but fails to capture the emotional conflict and social pressure conveyed

          expression that means it's practically unavoidable to get some sleep for proper functioning.
      - competing_japanese:
          - まったく 寝 ない の は 良く ない
        english: Not sleeping at all is not good.
        hint: This states a negative consequence, but not the practical inevitability of needing sleep,
          which the original expression conveys more strongly. We're looking for an expression that implies
          'no way to avoid' due to physical necessity.

    setting: cautious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

      I have circumstances.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - アルバイト を し なけれ ば なら ない
        english: I must do a part-time job.
        hint: This sounds more like a direct instruction or a general rule, less about personal circumstances.
          We're looking for an expression that conveys specific, compelling circumstances (事情 が ある) that
          force the action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - アルバイト を する 必要 が ある
        english: There is a need to do a part-time job.
        hint: This states necessity, but lacks the nuance of an unavoidable personal situation that the

          to personal reasons.
    scene: Explaining your circumstances to a potential employer.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「事情 が ある」 provides a reason why the speaker must work despite being a student. The younger
      female uses a semi-formal tone to explain her situation to an older male, possibly in an interview
      context.
  - english: Although it is a menu I am used to, there is no way to avoid taste testing it.
    japanese:
      - 慣れ た メニュー だ と は いえ、味見 {し ない わけ に は いか ない}。
      - 慣れ た メニュー だ と は いえ、味見 {し ない わけ に は いき ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Although it's a familiar menu, it's not that I can't not taste test it.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 味見 し なけれ ば なら ない
        english: I must taste test it.
        hint: This provides less emphasis on the professional standard or unspoken rule that necessitates
          it. We're looking for an expression that highlights the professional obligation that makes the
          action unavoidable, even if seemingly redundant.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 味見 する 必要 が ある
        english: There is a need to taste test it.
        hint: This is similar, but less about the unavoidable nature due to professional responsibility
          as implied by the original expression. We're looking for an expression that means 'no way to
          avoid' due to professional standards.
    scene: A chef explaining to a colleague about quality control.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male

    nuance: The expression 「とはいえ」 sets up a contrast, emphasizing that even with familiarity, a crucial
      step cannot be skipped. The older male chef imparts professional wisdom to his younger male colleague.
  - english: Because there's an important meeting today, I can't afford to take time off, even if I'm
      feeling unwell.
    japanese:
      - 今日 は 大事 な 会議 が ある から、具合 が 悪く て も {休め ない わけ に は いか ない}。
      - 今日 は 大事 な 会議 が ある から、具合 が 悪く て も {休め ない わけ に は いき ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Because there's an important meeting today, even if I'm feeling unwell, it's not
      that I can't not take time off.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 休む べき で は ない
        english: I shouldn't take time off.
        hint: This implies a choice or a moral judgment, not a strong, external obligation that overrides
          personal health. We're looking for an expression that conveys 'no way to avoid' due to compelling
          external circumstances.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 休ん で は いけ ない
        english: I mustn't take time off.
        hint: This implies a prohibition, not a compelling circumstance. The original expression captures
          the impossibility of taking time off due to the compelling situation. We're looking for an expression
          that means 'no way to avoid' due to external reasons.
    scene: An employee telling their spouse why they have to go to work.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「休め ない わけ に は いきません」 is in the polite form, showing respect to the listener. Being sick 「具合
      が 悪い」 is a valid reason not to come, but in this circumstance, the person still needs to attend,
      emphasizing the strong obligation in a professional setting.
  - english: I'm well aware you're busy, but I simply cannot not invite you for a drink tonight.
    japanese:
      - お 忙しい こと は よく 分かっ て い ます が、あなた を 今夜 の 飲み に お 誘い {し ない わけ に は いか ない}。
      - お 忙しい こと は よく 分かっ て い ます が、あなた を 今夜 の 飲み に お 誘い {し ない わけ に は いき ませ ん}。
    english_literally: I am well aware you are busy, but it's not that I can't not invite you for a drink
      tonight.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 誘い し なけれ ば なり ませ ん
        english: I must invite you.
        hint: This sounds like a mere obligation, lacking the 'irresistible urge' nuance present in the
          original expression. The flirty setting implies a strong, almost unavoidable personal desire.
          We're looking for an expression that conveys an unavoidable desire.
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 誘い し たい です
        english: I want to invite you.
        hint: This is too direct and less subtle for a flirty, business context. The original expression
          conveys the invitation more artfully than a simple declaration of intent. We're looking for
          an expression that frames the invitation as an unavoidable necessity.
    scene: An older man (boss) talking to a younger female employee after work hours.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: flirty
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「よく 分かって います が」 and the polite 「お誘い し ない わけ に は いきません」 makes the invitation formal
      and persistent. This can be seen as charmingly persistent in a flirty context. The older male, using
      respectful language, subtly implies an irresistible urge to invite her, framing it as an unavoidable
      necessity.
  - english: Today's meeting feels just like fate. I simply cannot not see you again, can I?
    japanese:
      - 今日 の 出会い は、まるで 運命 の よう。もう 二 度 と あなた に {会わ ない わけ に は いか ない} ね。
      - 今日 の 出会い は、まるで 運命 の よう。もう 二 度 と あなた に {会わ ない わけ に は いき ませ ん} ね。
    english_literally: Today's encounter is just like fate. It's not that I can't not see you again, is
      it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 一 度 会い たい です
        english: I want to see you again.
        hint: This is too blunt and lacks the romantic inevitability implied by 'fate.' The original expression
          expresses it as an unavoidable consequence of the strong connection. We're looking for an expression
          that conveys an unavoidable desire.
      - competing_japanese:
          - また 会わ なけれ ば なり ませ ん
        english: I must see you again.
        hint: This sounds like a chore or a strict duty, not romantic. The original expression expresses
          it as an unavoidable consequence of the strong connection. We're looking for an expression that
          portrays seeing the person again as a romantic inevitability.
    scene: At the end of a first meeting that went exceptionally well, implying a strong connection.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: first-date
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「まるで 運命 の よう」 (just like fate) explicitly sets a romantic tone. The speaker, a
      younger female, uses 「もう 二度 と あなた に 会わ ない わけ に は いきません ね」 which expresses an unavoidable desire
      to meet again. The ending particle 「ね」 softens the statement, making it sound more like an intimate
      observation or a shared realization than a forceful demand.
  - english: Yesterday, even though I felt terrible with a cold, I couldn't avoid going to work because
      there was an important meeting.
    japanese:
      - 昨日、風邪 で 辛かっ た けど、大事 な 会議 が あっ た から、出勤 {し ない わけ に は いか なかっ た}。
      - 昨日、風邪 で 辛かっ た けど、大事 な 会議 が あっ た から、出勤 {し ない わけ に は いき ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: Yesterday, although I was having a tough time with a cold, because there was an
      important meeting, it's not that I couldn't not go to work.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 出勤 し なけれ ば なら なかっ た
        english: I had to go to work.
        hint: This focuses on a general obligation rather than the personal struggle and the external,
          compelling circumstance (important meeting) that made coming to work unavoidable despite being
          sick. We're looking for an expression that conveys 'no way to avoid' due to specific compelling
          reasons.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 出勤 する しか なかっ た
        english: While similar, this often implies a complete lack of alternatives. The original expression
          still carries the nuance of reluctance and an underlying reason why the negative action (not
          going) was impossible. We're looking for an expression that implies 'could not not do' due to
          specific circumstances.
        hint: While similar, this often implies a complete lack of alternatives. The original expression
          still carries the nuance of reluctance and an underlying reason why the negative action (not
          going) was impossible. We're looking for an expression that implies 'could not not do' due to
          specific circumstances.
    scene: An employee explaining to a colleague why they came to work sick.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「風邪 で 辛かった けど」 expresses the speaker's physical discomfort, highlighting the specific
      circumstance that made going to work difficult. However, the external factor of 「大事 な 会議」 (important
      meeting) made it impossible to avoid. The older male speaks in a semi-formal tone to a female colleague,
      justifying his presence despite illness.
post_example_writeup: Understanding 「ないわけにはいかない」 requires attention to the context, as it always implies
  a compelling reason, whether external or internal, that makes an action unavoidable. It's often used
  when the speaker feels a sense of duty, practical necessity, or strong social obligation, even if they
  would prefer not to do it.
