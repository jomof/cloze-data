    "etymology": "The expression 「かもしれない」 is derived from 「かも」 (kamo), which means \"perhaps\" or \"maybe,\" combined with the potential form of the verb 「知る」 (shiru, to know) in the negative, 「しれない」 (shirenai, cannot know). Thus, literally, it suggests \"even (A), we cannot know,\" conveying uncertainty.",
    "writeup": "「かもしれない」 is a common Japanese expression used to express uncertainty or possibility. It's often translated as \"might,\" \"maybe,\" or \"perhaps.\" While often treated as a single word, it combines the particle 「かも」 (kamo) with the potential form of the verb 「知る」 (shiru - to know) and the auxiliary verb 「ない」 (nai). To use 「かもしれない」, attach it to the end of a verb, *i*-adjective, *na*-adjective, or noun in its plain form.\n\n*   **Polite Form:** The polite form, 「かもしれません」, is created by changing 「しれない」 to its polite potential form.\n*   **Colloquial Forms:** Several colloquial variations exist, including 「かも」, 「かもしらん」, and 「かもしれん」. 「かも」 is the most common, while 「かもしらん」 might sound a bit rough or boyish.",

For emphasizing uncertainty, 「もしかしたら」 can be used to add emphasis. Remember that 「かもしれない」 primarily conveys possibility without soliciting agreement or expressing a strong opinion."
