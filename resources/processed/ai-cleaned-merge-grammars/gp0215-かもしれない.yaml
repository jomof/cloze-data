    "etymology": "The expression 「かもしれない」 is derived from 「かも」 (kamo), which means \"perhaps\" or \"maybe,\" combined with the potential form of the verb 「知る」 (shiru, to know) in the negative, 「しれない」 (shirenai, cannot know). Thus, literally, it suggests \"even (A), we cannot know,\" conveying uncertainty.",
    "writeup": "「かもしれない」 is a common Japanese expression used to express uncertainty or possibility. It's often translated as \"might,\" \"maybe,\" or \"perhaps.\" While often treated as a single unit, it combines the particle 「かも」 (kamo) with the potential form of the verb 「知る」 (shiru - to know) and the auxiliary verb 「ない」 (nai). To use 「かもしれない」, attach it to the plain form of a verb, *i*-adjective, *na*-adjective, or noun.\n\n*   **Polite Form:** The polite form, 「かもしれません」, is created by changing 「しれない」 to its polite equivalent. This form is suitable for more formal contexts.\n*   **Colloquial Forms:** Several colloquial variations exist, including 「かも」, 「かもしらん」, and 「かもしれん」. 「かも」 is the most common and widely used in casual conversation. 「かもしらん」 and 「かもしれん」 are less common and can sometimes sound a bit rough or boyish, particularly 「かもしらん」.",
