        "function": "To present a reason or justification, often carrying an apologetic or mitigating tone. It implies an underlying plea for understanding or forgiveness for a situation caused by the stated reason.",
        "nuance": "Carries a distinctly refined and somewhat archaic nuance, signaling a high degree of politeness and humility. It implies a situation where the stated circumstance is a valid, often unavoidable, explanation for a regrettable outcome.",

    },
    "etymology": "「こととて」 is derived from 「事」 (koto, meaning 'thing' or 'matter') combined with the particle 「とて」, which indicates reason or cause. 「とて」 itself is an older particle, possibly formed from 「と」 (to, a case-marking particle) and 「て」 (te, a conjunctive particle), or alternatively, from the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「たり」 (tari) plus 「て」. Its precise etymological root remains debated, but it has historically served as a formal means to express reason or justification.",
    "writeup": "「こととて」 is a highly formal expression used to present a reason or justification, often carrying an apologetic or mitigating tone. It functions similarly to \"due to,\" \"since,\" or \"because of,\" but with a distinctly refined and somewhat archaic nuance. In contemporary Japanese, its usage is primarily confined to formal written contexts, such as official documents, letters of apology, or literary works. It is rarely used in casual spoken Japanese and is more common in written communication or very formal speeches.\n\nIt attaches to a noun followed by the particle 「の」 (e.g., 「新人のこととて」) or to the plain past tense or negative plain form of a verb (e.g., 「起こったこととて」, 「知らぬこととて」). This highlights something that was done and shouldn't have been, or wasn't done and should have been.\n\nThis grammar point is frequently employed when the speaker or writer seeks forgiveness, understanding, or aims to explain a situation where a negative outcome is either expected or has already occurred. The reason provided with 「こととて」 implicitly requests that the listener or reader consider the stated circumstance as a valid, often unavoidable, explanation for the situation at hand. It is not merely a statement of cause but rather an explanation given in a tone that invites leniency or acceptance of a regrettable situation.",

            "nuance": "「ゆえに」 is a highly formal and literary conjunction indicating a clear cause-and-effect relationship, often a logical or philosophical consequence. While also expressing reason, it lacks the apologetic or mitigating nuance inherent in 「こととて」. It states a definitive conclusion based on a premise, whereas 「こととて」 explains a situation often requiring understanding."

            "nuance": "「ので」 is a common and versatile particle for expressing a reason or cause, often used in both casual and polite speech. Compared to 「こととて」, 「ので」 is much less formal and does not carry the specialized nuance of an apology or a plea for understanding based on an unavoidable circumstance.

            "nuance": "「ため」 is a more formal way to express reason or cause than 「ので」, often used in written contexts or formal speech. While it indicates cause and effect, it generally presents the reason more objectively. 「こととて」, however, introduces a reason with an implicit tone of apology, explanation, or a request for understanding, suggesting that the stated circumstance is an unavoidable or mitigating factor for a situation, often a negative one."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When selecting among expressions like 「こととて」, 「ことですし」, 「ことから」, 「ゆえに」, 「ので」, and 「ため」, consider the precise nuance and formality you wish to convey. 「こととて」 is reserved for formal, often apologetic explanations of a circumstance that has led to a specific outcome. 「ことですし」 indicates a general reason or circumstance that prompts a certain action. 「ことから」 serves to introduce the basis for an inference or conclusion. 「ゆえに」, a more literary term, states a direct, logical consequence. 「ので」 and 「ため」 are more general causal expressions, with 「ため」 being more formal than 「ので」, but neither carries the specific nuanced plea for understanding or apology that 「こととて」 does.
