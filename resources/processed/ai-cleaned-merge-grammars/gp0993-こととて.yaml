    "etymology": "こととて is a combination of the noun 「こと」, meaning 'thing', and the binding (adverbial) particle 「とて」, which is used for presenting reasons. 「とて」 is thought to either be a combination of the case-marking particle 「と」 and the conjunction particle 「て」, or the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「たり」, 「と」, and the conjunction particle 「て」.",
    "writeup": "「こととて」 is a formal expression used to provide a reason or excuse, often when seeking forgiveness. It combines the noun 「こと」 (thing, matter) with the adverbial particle 「とて」 (due to, because of). This expression is considered old-fashioned and is primarily found in written Japanese. It translates to 'due to (A)' or 'because of (A)'.\n\nTo use 「こととて」, attach it to the end of a verb in the past tense or negative form, or to a noun followed by the particle 「の」. When used with verbs, the past tense or negative form highlights something that was done incorrectly or not done at all. In many cases, (A) will be something for which the negative result of (B) is obvious or expected.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   「こととて」 is primarily used in formal contexts, such as business letters or formal apologies.",
