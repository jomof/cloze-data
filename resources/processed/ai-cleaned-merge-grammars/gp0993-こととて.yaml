    },
    "etymology": "「こととて」 is derived from 「事」 (koto, meaning 'thing' or 'matter') combined with the particle 「とて」, which indicates reason or cause. 「とて」 itself is an older particle, possibly formed from 「と」 (to, a case-marking particle) and 「て」 (te, a conjunctive particle), or alternatively, from the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「たり」 (tari) plus 「て」. Its precise etymological root remains debated, but it has historically served as a formal means to express reason or justification.",
    "writeup": "「こととて」 is a highly formal expression used to present a reason or justification, often carrying an apologetic or mitigating tone. It functions similarly to \"due to,\" \"since,\" or \"because of,\" but with a distinctly refined and somewhat archaic nuance. In contemporary Japanese, its usage is primarily confined to formal written contexts, such as official documents, letters of apology, or literary works. It attaches to a noun followed by the particle 「の」 (e.g., 「新人のこととて」) or to the plain past tense or negative plain form of a verb (e.g., 「起こったこととて」, 「知らぬこととて」).\n\nThis grammar point is frequently employed when the speaker or writer seeks forgiveness, understanding, or aims to explain a situation where a negative outcome is either expected or has already occurred. The reason provided with 「こととて」 implicitly requests that the listener or reader consider the stated circumstance as a valid, often unavoidable, explanation for the situation at hand. It is not merely a statement of cause but rather an explanation given in a tone that invites leniency or acceptance of a regrettable situation.",
