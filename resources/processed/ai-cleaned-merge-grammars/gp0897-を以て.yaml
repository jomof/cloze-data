        "[Noun] + を以て": "Indicates means, method, reason, or time limit in formal or written contexts. Similar to 「で」 but more emphatic."
    },
    "jlpt": "N1",
    "meaning": "By means of, With, By, Via, In view of",

    },
    "etymology": "「以 (も)つ」 is an old verb meaning \"to use, employ, or consider\". The 「を以て」 grammar point evolved from this verb to indicate a means, method, or reason. It carries a formal and somewhat literary tone, emphasizing the instrument or method being used.",
    "writeup": "「を以て」 is a formal grammar pattern stemming from the meaning of its kanji counterpart 以て, meaning \"by means of.\" It functions similarly to the case-marking particle 「で」, and can be translated as \"with (A),\" \"by (A),\" \"via (A),\" or \"by means of (A).\" As this structure is preceded by the particle 「を」, it will only be used directly following nouns or noun phrases.\n\nDespite its similarity to 「で」 in meaning, 「を以て」 is generally not used for simple methods of doing something, such as 'traveling by train.' The most accurate translation often emphasizes the means, similar to how 'by means of' is used in English. Furthermore, it is not typically used with concrete items like a fork or a hammer; instead, it commonly appears with abstract concepts, such as 'with sincerity' or 'with compassion.'\n\nAn important related pattern is 「を以てすれば」, which is commonly encountered and can be translated as 'assuming that it were with (A)' or 'if one were to use (A)'.",
