    "etymology": "「以 (も) って」is the continuative form (中止形) of the classical Japanese verb 「以 (も) つ」, meaning \"to use,\" \"to employ,\" or \"to consider.\" This grammar point retains the nuance of employing something—often abstract—as a means or method.",
    "writeup": "「をもって」is a formal grammar pattern stemming from the meaning of the kanji 「以」, meaning \"by means of.\" It is used similarly to the case-marking particle 「で」, and will be translated as \"with (A),\" \"by (A),\" \"via (A),\" or \"by means of (A).\" As this structure is preceded by the particle 「を」, it will only be used directly following nouns or noun phrases.\n\nDespite being similar to 「で」in meaning, 「をもって」 generally will not be used regarding simple methods of doing something, such as traveling by train. The translation of \"by means of\" is the most accurate, as it would only be used in situations where the speaker is trying to emphasize the means. It is not often used with concrete items, such as a fork or a hammer, but instead will appear alongside abstract concepts, like \"with sincerity\" or \"with compassion.\"\n\nImportant note: 「をもってすれば」 is a commonly occurring pattern and may be translated as \"going off the assumption that it were with (A).\"",
