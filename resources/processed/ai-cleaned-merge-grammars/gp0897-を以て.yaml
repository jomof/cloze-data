    "etymology": "「以 (も)つ」 is an old verb meaning \"to use, employ, or consider\". The 「を以て」grammar point evolved from this verb to indicate a means, method, or reason. It carries a formal and somewhat literary tone, emphasizing the instrument or method being used.",
    "writeup": "「をもって」 is a formal grammar pattern derived from the meaning of its kanji counterpart 「以て」, meaning \"by means of.\" It functions similarly to the case-marking particle 「で」, translating to \"with (A),\" \"by (A),\" \"via (A),\" or \"by means of (A).\" Because it's preceded by the particle 「を」, it directly follows nouns or noun phrases.\n\nWhile similar to 「で」in meaning, 「をもって」 is generally not used for simple methods, such as \"traveling by train.\" Thus, \"by means of\" is often the most accurate translation, used when the speaker emphasizes the means. It's not often used with concrete items like forks or hammers, but instead appears with abstract concepts like \"with sincerity\" or \"with compassion.\"\n\n**Important Note:** 「をもってすれば」 is a common pattern, translating to \"assuming that it were with (A).\"",
