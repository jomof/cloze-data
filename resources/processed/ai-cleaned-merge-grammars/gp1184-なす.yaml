    "etymology": "The verb 「なす」 has ancient roots, stemming from the Old Japanese verb 「為す(為る)」 (為す/為る), which carried a broad meaning of 'to do' or 'to make'. Over time, while 「する」 became the more common and versatile verb for 'to do,' 「なす」 retained a more formal and literary flavor. Its usage is now often seen in set phrases, academic writing, and situations where a more elevated tone is desired. It's important to note that in modern Japanese, 「なす」 is not as frequently used in everyday conversation as 「する」.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「なす」 is a formal and somewhat literary verb that means \"to do,\" \"to perform,\" \"to make,\" \"to change,\" or \"to constitute.\" It is not as common in everyday conversation as 「する」, but it is frequently used in written language, especially in academic, business, and literary contexts.\n\n**Key Usages:**\n\n*   **Transforming something:** Often used in the pattern 「AをBと**なす**」, meaning \"to regard A as B\" or \"to transform A into B.\"\n*   **Performing an action formally:** 「～が**なされる**」 is a passive construction indicating that an action is performed, often in an official or formal context.\n*   **Constituting a foundation:** Used to describe something that forms the basis or foundation of something else.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「なす」 is generally more formal than 「する」 and should be used in appropriate contexts.\n*   Pay attention to the specific patterns in which 「なす」 is used, as the meaning can vary depending on the context.",
