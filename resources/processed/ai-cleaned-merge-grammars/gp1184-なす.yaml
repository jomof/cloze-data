    "etymology": "「なす」 originally derives from the verb 「為す」, which has roots in classical Japanese. Its meaning has evolved over time to encompass various forms of \"doing,\" \"making,\" and \"constituting.\"",
    "writeup": "The verb 「なす」 is a somewhat formal and often literary way of saying \"to do,\" \"to perform,\" \"to make,\" or \"to constitute.\" It carries a nuanced sense of actively causing something to happen, bringing something into existence, or forming the essential nature of something. While similar to 「する」 or 「行う」, 「なす」 is distinctly more formal and is frequently encountered in written texts, academic discourse, and more serious or reflective contexts.\n\n「なす」 can be employed in several key patterns:\n\n*   **[Noun1]を[Noun2]と{なす}**: This structure signifies \"to regard Noun1 as Noun2\" or \"to transform Noun1 into Noun2.\" It implies a deliberate act of conceptualizing or changing the nature of something.\n\n*   **[Noun]を{なす}**: This usage generally means \"to do Noun\" or \"to perform Noun.\" It often appears when speaking of actions that have a significant impact, are performed with effort, or relate to moral or foundational deeds, such as \"to do good\" (善をなす) or \"to constitute a foundation\" (基礎をなす).\n\n*   **[Noun]が{なされる}**: The passive form, 「なされる」, is quite common. It conveys that an action is \"being done\" or \"being performed\" in an impersonal, formal, or objective manner, often seen in reports, academic writing, or when describing official procedures.",
