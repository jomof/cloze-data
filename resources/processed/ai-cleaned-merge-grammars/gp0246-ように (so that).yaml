    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ように」 functions to express a purpose or to describe an action undertaken to achieve a particular outcome. It conveys a nuance of the speaker having an indirect influence or lacking direct control over the result, implying an effort to bring about a desired state. This construction is typically translated as \"so that...\" or \"in order to allow...\".\n\nIt is commonly affixed to verbs in their potential form, for instance, when expressing the ability to do something, or to verbs in their negative form, such as when describing an action to prevent something from happening. It can also be used with verbs in their standard dictionary (non-past) form.\n\nWhen using verbs like 「する」, which do not inherently possess a potential form, 「できる」 is employed instead to form expressions such as 「できるように」.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When using 「ように」, be mindful of the specific nuance you want to convey. If you're expressing a simple purpose with an indirect outcome or enabling an ability, 「ように」 is a good choice. However, if you're giving an instruction, describing a change, or indicating an effort, other expressions like 「ように言う」, 「ようになる」, or 「ようにする」 might be more appropriate. Additionally, differentiate it from 「ために」 by remembering that 「ために」 focuses on direct purpose and clear results, while 「ように」 is used when the outcome is not entirely within direct control or when creating a conducive condition for something to happen or not happen.",
