    "etymology": "The word 「次第」 originally meant \"order,\" \"sequence,\" or \"program.\" This meaning is preserved in its grammatical usage, where it indicates that something happens in sequence after a preceding action or is determined by a preceding condition.",
    "writeup": "次第 (shidai) is a noun that functions to indicate either a temporal sequence or a dependency. It conveys the meaning \"as soon as\" when following a verb, or \"depending on\" when following a noun. It is generally used in formal or polite contexts.\n\nThe fundamental concept behind 次第 is \"determining sequence\" or \"determining factor.\" It signifies that an action or outcome (B) is directly governed by a preceding condition or event (A).\n\nWhen 次第 follows the ます-stem of a verb, it means \"as soon as\" or \"upon completion of.\" This usage emphasizes that action B will commence immediately or very soon after action A is completed. The verb itself is the determining factor, so the second action (B) simply happens once the first action (A) occurs.\n\nWhen 次第 follows a noun, it means \"depending on\" or \"in accordance with.\" Here, the noun acts as the determining factor for an outcome or choice. The specific nuance can vary based on the type of noun:\n*   Following a living noun (e.g., 人, 君): This implies that the choice or action (B) is contingent upon the decision or will of the person (A).\n*   Following an inanimate or abstract noun (e.g., 天気, 状況): This indicates that the outcome (B) is determined by the state or condition of the noun (A). While inanimate objects cannot \"choose,\" their state dictates the course of action.\n\nRegardless of the pattern, 次第 consistently highlights a direct and immediate relationship between the preceding element and the subsequent event or outcome. It is often used in official announcements, business communications, or when expressing a strong sense of inevitability or certainty.",
