    "writeup": "次第 (shidai) is a versatile word that functions as a noun, often acting as a suffix or quasi-conjunction to indicate either a temporal sequence or a dependency. It is generally used in formal or polite contexts.\n\nAt its core, 次第 conveys the concept of a \"determining sequence\" or \"determining factor.\" This means that an action or outcome (B) is directly governed by a preceding condition or event (A).\n\n**1. Verb-ます stem + 次第: 'As soon as'**\nWhen 次第 follows the ます-stem of a verb, it means \"as soon as\" or \"upon completion of.\" This usage emphasizes that action B will commence immediately or very soon after action A is completed. The verb itself is the determining factor, so the second action (B) simply happens once the first action (A) occurs. This construction implies a swift and direct consequence.\n\n**2. Noun + 次第: 'Depending on'**\nWhen 次第 follows a noun, it means \"depending on\" or \"in accordance with.\" Here, the noun acts as the determining factor for an outcome or choice. The specific nuance can vary based on the type of noun:\n*   **Following a living noun** (e.g., 人, 君): This implies that the choice or action (B) is contingent upon the decision or will of the person (A).\n*   **Following an inanimate or abstract noun** (e.g., 天気, 状況): This indicates that the outcome (B) is determined by the state or condition of the noun (A). While inanimate objects cannot \"choose,\" their state dictates the course of action.\n\nRegardless of the pattern, 次第 consistently highlights a direct and immediate relationship between the preceding element and the subsequent event or outcome. It is often used in official announcements, business communications, or when expressing a strong sense of inevitability or certainty.",
