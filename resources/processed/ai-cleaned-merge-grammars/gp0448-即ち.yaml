    "etymology": "The term 即ち (すなわち) comes from the verb 即く (つく), which means 'to conform to,' 'to be based on,' or 'to follow.' The 連用形 (ren'yōkei or continuative form) of this verb, 即ち, evolved to become an adverbial conjunction indicating equivalence or clarification.",
    "writeup": "Much like 「つまり」, 「即ち」 is a Japanese grammar pattern often translated as \"in other words.\" It can also mean \"namely\" or \"that is to say.\" While 「即ち」 is technically an adverb, it often acts as a conjunction, connecting two statements where the second clarifies the first. \n\n**Important Consideration**\nThe kanji in 「即ち」 means \"in concordance,\" suggesting that it indicates agreement or correspondence. 「つまり」, however, purely summarizes. Use 「即ち」 when you want to say 'A is the same as B'.",
