    "etymology": "「即ち」 comes from the verb 「即く(つく)」, which means 「すぐに」 or 「その場で」 (immediately, or on the spot). Over time, it evolved to mean 'in other words' or 'that is,' indicating an immediate clarification or restatement.",
    "writeup": "「即ち」 (sokuchi) is similar to 「つまり」, functioning as a conjunction to connect two sentences. It translates to \"in other words,\" \"that is,\" or \"namely.\" 「即ち」 indicates that the second sentence clarifies or restates the first, providing further explanation or specification. The nuance is that of 'agreeance' or 'correspondence' between the two statements.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene describes a formal introduction in a professional setting, where 「即ち」 is a more precise and formal choice than 「つまり」, which might be too casual for this context."

            "nuance": "The speaker uses the polite form 「です」 (desu), which is common in formal settings and is gender-neutral. The use of 「即ち」 also contributes to the formal tone, making it appropriate for a male speaker in a professional setting. The sentence structure itself does not contain overtly gendered language for the speaker."

While 「私」 (watashi) can be used by any gender, it is a standard choice for female speakers in formal contexts, ensuring the sentence is natural for a female speaker. The overall formality of the sentence means there is no other gender-specific phrasing."
