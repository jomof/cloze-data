        "usage-context": "Primarily used in formal writing and speech, indicating a strong conviction or concession. Often appears with interrogative or concessive terms."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「であれ」 derives from 「である」, the formal copula, which itself is a combination of the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb 「だ」 and the verb 「ある」. 「あれ」 is the imperative form of 「ある」. The more literal meaning is closer to \"so it's (A), (B) still won't be affected.\" 「であろうと」 is the positive volitional form combined with the case-marking particle 「と」.",
    "writeup": "「であれ」 functions as an extension of 「である」, the formal copula. It's often used to express a strong will or conviction. 「あれ」 is the imperative form of 「ある」, while 「であろうと」 is the positive volitional form combined with the case-marking particle 「と」. Both structures are usually translated as \"even if (A), (B)\" or \"no matter if (A), (B)\". The more literal meaning of each is closer to \"so it's (A), (B) still won't be affected,\" emphasizing that (A) has no relation to the result, similar to saying \"so what if it is\" in English. 「であれ」 and 「であろうと」 primarily attach to nouns and な-adjective stems in sentences that express a question or assumption using words like 「どんな」 or 「たとえ」. Because both 「であれ」 and 「であろうと」 use structures indicating strong will, they're frequently used in sentences where the speaker expresses their opinions or resolutions.",
