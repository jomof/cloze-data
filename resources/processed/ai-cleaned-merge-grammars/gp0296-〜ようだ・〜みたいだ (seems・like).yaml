pronunciation:
  katakana: ミタイ・ヨウダ
  romaji: mitai・youda
formation:
  Verb (plain form) + みたい・ようだ: Expresses that something seems to be the case, based on observation or
    evidence, or resembles the action.
  い-adjective (plain form) + みたい・ようだ: Indicates that something seems to be the case, or resembles the
    quality.
  な-adjective (stem) + (な) + みたい・(な) + ようだ: Indicates that something seems to be the case, or resembles
    the quality. 'な' is necessary for ようだ.
  Noun + (の) + みたい・(の) + ようだ: Indicates similarity, conjecture, or resemblance. 'の' is necessary for ようだ,
    and 'みたいな' or 'みたいに' are common.
  Demonstrative (e.g., その) + ようだ: Used to express 'it seems so' or 'it looks like that'.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The etymology of 「みたい」 traces back to 「見たような」 (mita yō na), meaning 'like I saw,' reflecting
  its origin in visual or perceived similarities. 「よう」, on the other hand, derives from the noun 「様」 (sama/yō),
  meaning 'appearance' or 'manner,' explaining its core function of describing how something appears or
  seems based on observation or deduction. Both forms have evolved to express conjecture, appearance,
  and resemblance.
writeup: The grammar points 「みたい」 and 「ようだ」 are highly versatile expressions used to convey **likelihood,
  appearance, or resemblance**. While sharing core functionalities, they exhibit distinct nuances and
  formality levels. **「みたい」** is notably more **casual, conversational, and subjective**. It frequently
  expresses a personal impression or a general resemblance, akin to saying "seems like" or "looks like"
  based on direct observation or intuition. It can attach to the plain form of verbs, い-adjectives, the
  stem of な-adjectives, and nouns. When modifying a noun, it typically takes the form 「みたいな」 (e.g., 子供みたいな人
  - a person like a child), and when modifying a verb or adjective, it uses 「みたいに」 (e.g., 鳥みたいに飛ぶ - fly
  like a bird). At the end of a sentence, it commonly appears as 「みたいだ」 or the polite 「みたいです」, with the
  「だ」 often omitted in very casual speech. **「ようだ」** is generally more **formal and objective**, suggesting
  a deduction based on more reliable, often firsthand, evidence or a considered assessment. It is commonly
  found in written Japanese or more formal spoken contexts. It attaches to the plain form of verbs and
  い-adjectives. For な-adjectives, it requires 「な」 (e.g., 静かなようだ - it seems quiet), and for nouns, it requires
  「の」 (e.g., 医者のようだ - he seems to be a doctor). 「ようだ」 can also be written with the kanji 「様だ」 in very
  formal or literary contexts. In summary, both 「みたい」 and 「ようだ」 primarily focus on conjecture and resemblance.
  Understanding these distinctions is key to using them accurately and naturally in Japanese.

  - term: そうに・そうな
    meaning: Seem, Look like, Sound
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「そうに・そうな」 indicates an immediate impression based on sensory information (visual or auditory),
      suggesting appearance or likelihood. In contrast, 「ように・ような」 can be based on a broader, more considered
      assessment of similarity in manner, state, or condition. When expressing conjecture, 「みたい・ようだ」 can
      be based on more comprehensive observation or evidence than 「そうに・そうな」.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]・[い-Adjective-stem]・[な-Adjective]そうだ (it seems・looks like)'
  - term: らしい
    meaning: Seems like, Apparently, I heard
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「らしい」 signifies conjecture or inference drawn from indirect information or common knowledge,
      where the source might be vague or external. 「みたい・ようだ」 are typically used when the observation is
      direct or the evidence is more concrete and reliable, or to express a more subjective resemblance.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
  - term: にみえる
    meaning: To look, to seem, to appear
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にみえる」 primarily focuses on how something appears visually, a subjective perception. 「みたい・ようだ」
      and 「ように・ような」 express a broader range of comparisons or deductions, including manner, condition,
      or abstract resemblance, not limited to visual appearance.
    grammar_point: にみえる (to look like)
  - term: とみえる
    meaning: It seems that, it appears that, one can conclude that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とみえる」 denotes a logical conclusion or deduction from circumstantial evidence, often used
      in more formal or academic contexts, implying a more reasoned inference. 「みたい・ようだ」 are broader in
      scope, encompassing general observations and subjective impressions, while 「ように・ような」 focus on comparisons
      or manner.
    grammar_point: とみえる (seems from observation)
  - term: かのようだ・かのように
    meaning: As if, Just like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「かのようだ・かのように」 implies a strong, often metaphorical, 'as if' comparison where the stated condition
      is not necessarily true but appears to be so. It is more formal or literary. 「みたい・ようだ」 express what
      genuinely seems or appears to be the case based on observation or evidence, and 「ように・ような」 are used
      for more direct, factual, or realistic comparisons.
    grammar_point: かのようだ・かのように (as if)
  - term: まるで…ようだ
    meaning: It is entirely as if, It is just as though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「まるで…ようだ」 is a strong comparison meaning 'just like' or 'as if', often used for dramatic or
      literary effect, emphasizing an almost unreal resemblance. While 「まるで…みたいだ」 can also be used, 「まるで…ようだ」
      often carries a slightly more formal or emphatic tone than the more general 「みたいだ」 or 「ようだ」 for
      conjecture.
    grammar_point: まるで…ようだ (just like)
  - term: ような気がする
    meaning: Have a feeling that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ような気がする」 indicates a subjective feeling, intuition, or sense about something, which is distinct
      from making a direct comparison or expressing a deduction based on objective qualities or manner.
    grammar_point: ような気がする (to have a feeling or hunch)
  - term: ときいた
    meaning: I heard that
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ときいた」 is a direct statement of hearsay, clearly indicating information received from another
      source. 「みたい・ようだ」 convey the speaker's own inference or observation, not merely reported information.
    grammar_point: ときいた (I heard that)
  - term: ようでは・ようじゃ
    meaning: If it seems that / If it is true that (often implying a negative consequence)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ようでは・ようじゃ」 is a conditional phrase meaning 'if it is in such a state/condition,' typically
      leading to a negative consequence. 「みたい・ようだ」 are used to express likelihood or resemblance, not
      to set a condition for an outcome.
    grammar_point: ようでは・ようじゃ (if it seems that)
  - term: '[Noun]らしい'
    meaning: In the sense of 'typical of,' 「らしい」 implies something is characteristic or befitting of a
      person or thing, indicating an inherent quality. In contrast, 「みたい」 suggests a superficial resemblance,
      a 'looks like' quality rather than an 'is like' quality.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「[Noun]らしい」 indicates that something is characteristic of or befitting a noun, implying an
      inherent quality or typical nature. 「みたい」 suggests a superficial resemblance, a 'looks like' quality
      rather than an 'is truly like' quality. This nuance also applies to 「よう」 in its comparative function.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]らしい (typical of・-like)'
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, it is crucial to understand the distinct nuances of these
  expressions. 「みたい」 and 「ようだ」 both express conjecture or resemblance, but 「みたい」 is more casual and subjective,
  suitable for personal impressions or direct observations. In contrast, 「ようだ」 is more formal and objective,
  conveying a higher degree of certainty based on concrete evidence. For comparison, 「そう」 (for appearance)
  offers a less certain, immediate impression, while (for hearsay) it reports information from others.
  「らしい」 suggests inference from indirect evidence or common knowledge. 「かのようだ・かのように」 and 「まるで…ようだ」 imply
  a strong, often metaphorical 'as if' comparison where the condition might not be factual. 「にみえる」 focuses
  specifically on visual appearance, and 「とみえる」 indicates a logical deduction. Finally, 「ときいた」 is a straightforward
  statement of hearsay, 「ようでは」 sets a negative conditional outcome, and 「[Noun]らしい」 is for expressing
  inherent qualities rather than superficial resemblance.

post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「みたい」 and 「ようだ」 are versatile and can be used
  in various situations to express resemblance or conjecture. 「みたい」 is particularly common in casual conversation,
  making your speech sound more natural and approachable. Pay attention to how it connects to nouns, verbs,
  and adjectives. 「ようだ」 tends to be used in more formal settings, conveying a greater sense of objectivity.
  Remember that 「みたい」 itself does not have a kanji form and should be written in hiragana or katakana,
  which is important to avoid confusing it with similarly sounding words suchs as 「見たい」 (want to see).
