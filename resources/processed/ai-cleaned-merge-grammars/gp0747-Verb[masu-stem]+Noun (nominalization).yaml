meaning: Turns a verb's masu-stem into a noun, often describing an action or state as a concept.
pronunciation:
  katakana: マス ケイ プラス メイシ
  romaji: masu kei purasu meishi
formation:
  Verb[masu-stem] + Noun: Transforms a verb into a noun-like form, often representing an action or state
    as a concept or activity. Functions as a noun within a sentence.
jlpt: N3
details:
  function: Nominalization
  nuance: This pattern provides a way to talk about activities or states in a more abstract, conceptual
    way.
  colocation: Often used with nouns like 不足 (fusoku - lack), 過ぎ (sugi - excessive), 応え (kotae - worth,
    response), 合わせ (awase - together, combine), 相手 (aite - partner), 道 (michi - way/path).
  grammatical-role: The nominalized verb acts as a noun and can serve as a subject, object, or part of
    a compound noun.
  temporal-flow: Refers to the state or action of the verb in a general sense, not bound to a specific
    tense, but rather the concept of the action.
etymology: This grammar point utilizes the 「ます」 stem (masu-kei) of a verb. Historically, the 「ます」 stem
  itself has roots in classical Japanese, where certain verb forms could function nominally. In modern
  Japanese, dropping 「ます」 to form the masu-stem inherently carries a sense of an unfinished or connecting
  form. When combined with a noun, it allows the action or state of the verb to be reified, becoming a
  conceptual entity. This is an efficient way to create new compound nouns or expressions that refer to
  an action as a concept rather than a specific event.
writeup: |-
  This grammar point transforms a verb into a noun by using its **masu-stem** form (the part of the verb that precedes 「ます」 in the polite form). This allows you to treat the action or state described by the verb as a noun, which can then function as the subject, object, or complement in a sentence. It provides a flexible way to discuss activities or states in a more abstract or conceptual manner.

  For example, from 「泳ぐ (oyogu - to swim)」, the masu-stem is 「泳ぎ (oyogi)」. When used as a noun, 「泳ぎ」 can refer to "swimming" as an activity or style. Similarly, 「読む (yomu - to read)」 yields 「読み (yomi)」, meaning "reading" as a concept or act.

  This construction is highly productive and is frequently encountered in various contexts, including:
  *   **Compound nouns**: Forming new words like 「待ち合わせ (machiawase - meeting place/time)」 from 「待つ (matsu - to wait)」 and 「合わせる (awaseru - to combine)」.
  *   **Idiomatic expressions**: Such as 「読み応えがある (yomigotae ga aru - to be worth reading)」.
  *   **Referring to states or conditions**: Like 「寝不足 (nebusoku - lack of sleep)」 from 「寝る (neru - to sleep)」 and 「不足 (fusoku - lack)」.

  This structure enables concise and natural expression, allowing speakers to refer to the essence of an action rather than a particular instance.
false_friends:
  - term: こと
    meaning: thing, matter, fact
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike Verb[masu-stem]+Noun, 「こと」 nominalizes entire clauses or general concepts, often referring
      to an abstract 'matter' or 'fact'.
    grammar_point: こと (nominalizer)
  - term: の
    meaning: nominalizer
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike Verb[masu-stem]+Noun which forms a noun-like word from the verb stem, 「の」 directly
      nominalizes a preceding verb or verb phrase, often emphasizing the action itself rather than a conceptual
      entity. For example, 「食べるの」 (eating) vs. 「食べ物」 (food, where 食べ is masu-stem).
    grammar_point: の (that ~)
  - term: Verb[dictionary form] + Noun
    meaning: A verb in dictionary form modifying a noun to describe a person or thing that performs the
      action.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike Verb[masu-stem]+Noun, which forms a noun *from* the verb stem (e.g., 「話し相手」 - conversation
      partner, where 話し is the nominalized verb), this structure uses a dictionary form verb to *modify*
      a noun, describing what kind of noun it is (e.g., 「話す人」 - a person who talks). The dictionary form
      is attributive, while the masu-stem form creates a new noun concept.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[dictionary form] + Noun (modifying nouns)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「こと」 and 「の」 both function as nominalizers, their nuances differ from
  the masu-stem + noun construction. 「こと」 tends to nominalize abstract ideas or general situations, whereas
  「の」 often focuses on the direct action or event. The masu-stem + noun structure, in contrast, creates
  a more integrated noun-like word that conceptualizes the verb's action itself. Furthermore, it is distinct
  from simply using a verb in its dictionary form to modify a noun, as the latter describes the noun's
  characteristic action, while the masu-stem + noun combination creates a new noun or compound term referring
  to the action or its associated concept.
examples:
  - english: That's a made-up story.
    japanese:
      - あれ は {作り} 話 だ。
      - あれ は {作り} 話 です。
      - あれ は {作り} 話 だ よ。
    english_literally: That is a made-up story.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あれ は 嘘 の 話 だ。
        english: That's a lie.
        hint: 「嘘の話」 is a general term for a false story. We're looking for a specific compound noun that
          means 'fabricated story' or 'fiction'.
    scene: A parent dismisses their child's wild tale with a shake of their head.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「作り話」 combines the masu-stem of 「作る」 (tsukuru - to make) with 「話」 (hanashi - story) to form
      a compound noun meaning 'fabricated story'. This is a direct and common way to state that something
      is not true, often used in casual contexts to dismiss something as fiction.
  - english: This book is worth reading.
    japanese:
      - この 本 は {読み} 応え が ある。
      - この 本 は {読み} 応え が あり ます。

    english_literally: As for this book, there is reading worth.

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 読む 価値 が ある。
        english: This book has reading value.
        hint: 「読む価値がある」 is a more literal translation. We're looking for a common, idiomatic expression
          for a book that is satisfying to read.
    scene: A man enthusiastically recommends a novel to a friend.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「読み」 is the masu-stem of 「読む」 (yomu), used as a noun in the fixed expression 「読み応え」. This
      expression implies that the reading experience itself is substantial and rewarding. The phrase implies
      that the book provides a 'response' or 'worth' to the act of reading, fitting the enthusiastic recommendation.
  - english: I have a headache lately due to lack of sleep.
    japanese:
      - 最近、{寝} 不足 で 頭 が 痛い。
      - 最近、{寝} 不足 で 頭 が 痛い です。
      - 最近、{寝} 不足 で 頭 痛ぇな。

          - 最近、睡眠 不足 で 頭 が 痛い。
        english: Lately, my head hurts due to insufficient sleep.

          sleep' in everyday conversation.
    scene: Someone complains about their fatigue after a busy week.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「寝」 is the masu-stem of 「寝る」 (neru), indicating the act of sleeping. When combined with 「不足」
      (fusoku - lack), it forms the compound noun 「寝不足」, meaning 'insufficient sleep' or 'lack of sleep'.
      This is a common and natural way to express this condition, particularly in casual conversation.
  - english: It's lonely when there's no one to talk to.
    japanese:
      - '{話し} 相手 が い ない と 寂しい。'
      - '{話し} 相手 が い ない と 寂しい です。'

    scene: A person reflects on their solitude after moving to a new city.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「話し」 is the masu-stem of 「話す」 (hanasu). When combined with 「相手」 (aite - partner), it forms
      「話し相手」, a compound noun meaning 'conversation partner'. This expresses the lack of someone with
      whom to engage in the activity of talking, emphasizing the specific role rather than just a person.

          means 'how to use' or 'utility'.
    scene: A shop assistant explains the versatility of a new product to a customer, demonstrating its
      multiple functionalities.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「使い道」 combines the masu-stem of 「使う」 (tsukau - to use) with 「道」 (michi - way/path) to form
      a compound noun referring to the 'method of use' or 'utility'. This emphasizes the practical applications
      of the tool's function.
  - english: When shall we meet?
    japanese:
      - '{待ち} 合わせ は いつ に し ます か？'

          a pre-arranged meeting or rendezvous point.
    scene: During a first date, one person suggests making plans for the next meeting.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: first-date

      (awaseru - to combine), forming the compound noun 「待ち合わせ」 which means 'a pre-arranged meeting' or
      'rendezvous'. It implies coordinating an arrival or meeting point, which is suitable for planning
      a next date.
  - english: That movie is worth watching.

          expression for a movie that is satisfying or substantial to watch.
    scene: A friend excitedly recommends a movie to another friend, highlighting its quality.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「見」 is the masu-stem of 「見る」 (miru). Here it is used to nominalize the act of 'seeing' or
      'watching', which then combines with 「応え」 (kotae - response/worth), resulting in the common expression
      「見応えがある」 meaning 'worth watching' or 'substantive viewing'. The use of 「よ」 (yo) adds a sense of
      assertion and conviction to the recommendation.

      strong reception.

      - going/progress) to denote the progress or trend of sales. This compound noun succinctly expresses
      the market's reception to the product's performance over time.
