meaning: Turns a verb's masu-stem into a noun, often describing an action or state as a concept.
pronunciation:
  katakana: マス ケイ プラス メイシ
  romaji: masu kei purasu meishi
formation:
  Verb[masu-stem] + Noun: Transforms a verb into a noun-like form, often representing an action or state
    as a concept or activity. Functions as a noun within a sentence.
jlpt: N3
details:
  function: Nominalization
  nuance: This pattern provides a way to talk about activities or states in a more abstract, conceptual
    way.
  colocation: Often used with words like 不足 (fusoku - lack), 過ぎ (sugi - excessive), 応え (kotae - worth,
    response), 合わせ (awase - together, combine), やすい (yasui - easy to), にくい (nikui - difficult to).
  grammatical-role: The nominalized verb acts as a noun and can serve as a subject, object, or part of
    a compound noun.
  temporal-flow: Refers to the state or action of the verb in a general sense, not bound to a specific
    tense, but rather the concept of the action.
etymology: This grammar point utilizes the 「ます」 stem (masu-kei) of a verb. Historically, the 「ます」 stem
  itself has roots in classical Japanese, where certain verb forms could function nominally. In modern
  Japanese, dropping 「ます」 to form the masu-stem inherently carries a sense of an unfinished or connecting
  form. When combined with a noun, it allows the action or state of the verb to be reified, becoming a
  conceptual entity. This is an efficient way to create new compound nouns or expressions that refer to
  an action as a concept rather than a specific event.
writeup: |-
  This grammar point transforms a verb into a noun by using its **masu-stem** form (the part of the verb that precedes 「ます」 in the polite form). This allows you to treat the action or state described by the verb as a noun, which can then function as the subject, object, or complement in a sentence. It provides a flexible way to discuss activities or states in a more abstract or conceptual manner.

  For example, from 「泳ぐ (oyogu - to swim)」, the masu-stem is 「泳ぎ (oyogi)」. When used as a noun, 「泳ぎ」 can refer to "swimming" as an activity or style. Similarly, 「読む (yomu - to read)」 yields 「読み (yomi)」, meaning "reading" as a concept or act.

  This construction is highly productive and is frequently encountered in various contexts, including:
  *   **Compound nouns**: Forming new words like 「待ち合わせ (machiawase - meeting place/time)」 from 「待つ (matsu - to wait)」 and 「合わせる (awaseru - to combine)」.
  *   **Idiomatic expressions**: Such as 「読み応えがある (yomigotae ga aru - to be worth reading)」.
  *   **Referring to states or conditions**: Like 「寝不足 (nebusoku - lack of sleep)」 from 「寝る (neru - to sleep)」 and 「不足 (fusoku - lack)」.

  This structure enables concise and natural expression, allowing speakers to refer to the essence of an action rather than a particular instance.
false_friends:
  - term: こと
    meaning: thing, matter, fact
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 'Unlike Verb[masu-stem]+Noun, 「こと」 nominalizes entire clauses or general concepts, often referring
      to an abstract ''matter'' or ''fact'', rather '
    grammar_point: こと (abstract thing)
  - term: の
    meaning: nominalizer
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike Verb[masu-stem]+Noun which forms a noun-like word from the verb stem, 「の」 directly
      nominalizes a preceding verb or verb phrase, often emphasizing the action itself rather than a conceptual
      entity. For example, 「食べるの」 (eating) vs. 「食べ物」 (food, where 食べ is masu-stem).
    grammar_point: の (that ~)
  - term: Verb[dictionary form] + Noun
    meaning: A verb in dictionary form modifying a noun to describe a person or thing that performs the
      action.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike Verb[masu-stem]+Noun, which forms a noun *from* the verb stem (e.g., 「話し相手」 - conversation
      partner, where 話し is the nominalized verb), this structure uses a dictionary form verb to *modify*
      a noun, describing what kind of noun it is (e.g., 「話す人」 - a person who talks). The dictionary form
      is attributive, while the masu-stem form creates a new noun concept.
    grammar_point: Relative Clause (modifying nouns)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「こと」 and 「の」 both function as nominalizers, their nuances differ from
  the masu-stem + noun construction. 「こと」 tends to nominalize abstract ideas or general situations, whereas
  「の」 often focuses on the direct action or event. The masu-stem + noun structure, in contrast, creates
  a more integrated noun-like word that conceptualizes the verb's action itself. Furthermore, it is distinct
  from simply using a verb in its dictionary form to modify a noun, as the latter describes the noun's
  characteristic action, while the masu-stem + noun combination creates a new noun or compound term referring
  to the action or its associated concept.
examples:
  - english: My hobby is going to listen to music.
    japanese:
      - 私 の 趣味 は、音楽 を {聴き} に 行く こと です。
      - 俺 の 趣味 は 音楽 を {聴き} に 行く こと だ よ。
      - 私 の 趣味 は 音楽 を {聴き} に 行く こと だ わ。
    english_literally: As for my hobby, it is the thing of going to listen to music.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 趣味 は、音楽 を 聴く こと です。
        english: My hobby is listening to music.
        hint: 「聴くこと」 is a general nominalization of the action. We're looking for a specific purpose of
          going somewhere to perform the action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 趣味 は、音楽 鑑賞 です。
        english: My hobby is music appreciation.
        hint: While 「音楽鑑賞」 means 'music appreciation', we're looking for an expression that specifically
          focuses on the physical act of 'going to listen'.
    scene: A young woman is asked about her hobbies and shares her passion for music.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「聴き」 is the masu-stem of 「聴く」 (kiku), used here to nominalize the action of listening. When
      combined with 「行く」 as 「聴きに行く」, it expresses the purpose of going somewhere to perform the action
      of listening. This sentence implies a specific, active pursuit of the hobby, emphasizing the physical
      act of going.
  - english: This book is worth reading.
    japanese:
      - この 本 は {読み} 応え が ある。
      - この 本 は {読み} 応え が あり ます。
      - この 本 は {読み} 応え が ある よ。
    english_literally: As for this book, there is reading worth.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 読む 価値 が ある。
        english: This book has reading value.
        hint: 「読む価値がある」 is a more literal translation. We're looking for a common, idiomatic expression
          for a book that is satisfying to read.
    scene: A man enthusiastically recommends a novel to a friend.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「読み」 is the masu-stem of 「読む」 (yomu), used as a noun in the fixed expression 「読み応え」. This
      expression implies that the reading experience itself is substantial and rewarding. The phrase implies
      that the book provides a 'response' or 'worth' to the act of reading, fitting the enthusiastic recommendation.
  - english: I have a headache lately due to lack of sleep.
    japanese:
      - 最近、{寝} 不足 で 頭 が 痛い。
      - 最近、{寝} 不足 で 頭 が 痛い です。
      - 最近、{寝} 不足 で 頭 痛ぇな。
      - 最近、{寝} 不足 で 頭 痛い わ。
    english_literally: Lately, due to lack of sleep, my head hurts.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 最近、睡眠 不足 で 頭 が 痛い。
        english: Lately, my head hurts due to insufficient sleep.
        hint: 「睡眠不足」 is a more formal term. We're looking for a common, natural expression for 'lack of
          sleep' in everyday conversation.
    scene: Someone complains about their fatigue after a busy week.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「寝」 is the masu-stem of 「寝る」 (neru), indicating the act of sleeping. When combined with 「不足」
      (fusoku - lack), it forms the compound noun 「寝不足」, meaning 'insufficient sleep' or 'lack of sleep'.
      This is a common and natural way to express this condition, particularly in casual conversation.
  - english: It's lonely when there's no one to talk to.
    japanese:
      - '{話し} 相手 が い ない と 寂しい。'
      - '{話し} 相手 が い ない と 寂しい です。'
      - '{話し} 相手 い ない と 寂しい な。'
      - 話し 相手 い ない と 寂しい わ。
    english_literally: When there is no talking partner, it is lonely.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 話す 人 が い ない と 寂しい。
        english: It's lonely when there's no one to talk to.
        hint: 「話す人」 refers to any person who talks. We're looking for a specific term for someone who
          engages in conversation or is a partner for talking.
    scene: A person reflects on their solitude after moving to a new city.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「話し」 is the masu-stem of 「話す」 (hanasu). When combined with 「相手」 (aite - partner), it forms
      「話し相手」, a compound noun meaning 'conversation partner'. This expresses the lack of someone with
      whom to engage in the activity of talking, emphasizing the specific role rather than just a person.
  - english: Is this town easy to live in?
    japanese:
      - この 町 は {住み} やすい です か？
      - この 町 {住み} やすい？
      - こちら の 町 は {住み} やすい です か？
    english_literally: As for this town, is it easy to live?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 町 は 住む の に 快適 です か？
        english: Is this town comfortable for living in?
        hint: 「住むのに快適」 is a more verbose and formal expression. We're looking for a standard, concise
          adjective for 'easy to live in'.
    scene: A woman asks a man, who has lived in the area for a long time, about the livability of the
      town.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: interrogative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「住み」 is the masu-stem of 「住む」 (sumu), which combines with the suffix 「やすい」 (yasui - easy to)
      to form 「住みやすい」, meaning 'easy to live in'. This shows the masu-stem's function in forming compound
      adjectives that describe the ease or difficulty of an action. This is a direct and common way to
      ask about a town's livability.
  - english: When shall we meet?
    japanese:
      - '{待ち} 合わせ は いつ に し ます か？'
      - '{待ち} 合わせ いつ に する？'

          - 会う 約束 は いつ に し ます か？
        english: When should we make an appointment to meet?
        hint: 「会う約束」 is a general appointment to meet. We're looking for a term that specifically implies
          a pre-arranged meeting or rendezvous point.
    scene: During a first date, one person suggests making plans for the next meeting.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: first-date
    nuance: 「待ち」 is the masu-stem of 「待つ」 (matsu), combined with 「合わせ」 (awase), the masu-stem of 「合わせる」
      (awaseru - to combine), forming the compound noun 「待ち合わせ」 which means 'a pre-arranged meeting' or
      'rendezvous'. It implies coordinating an arrival or meeting point, which is suitable for planning
      a next date.
  - english: That movie is worth watching.
    japanese:
      - その 映画 は {見} 応え が あり ます よ。
      - その 映画 は {見} 応え が ある よ。
      - あの 映画、{見} 応え ある ぞ！
      - その 映画、{見} 応え 十分 だ よ。
    english_literally: As for that movie, there is watching worth.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 映画 は 見る 価値 が あり ます よ。
        english: That movie has viewing value.
        hint: 「見る価値」 is a more general term for value in watching. We're looking for a common, idiomatic
          expression for a movie that is satisfying or substantial to watch.
    scene: A friend excitedly recommends a movie to another friend, highlighting its quality.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「見」 is the masu-stem of 「見る」 (miru). Here it is used to nominalize the act of 'seeing' or
      'watching', which then combines with 「応え」 (kotae - response/worth), resulting in the common expression
      「見応えがある」 meaning 'worth watching' or 'substantive viewing'. The use of 「よ」 (yo) adds a sense of
      assertion and conviction to the recommendation.
  - english: I haven't been getting enough exercise lately, so I think I'll go for a run.
    japanese:
      - 最近、{運動} 不足 だ から、少し {走り} に 行こう か な。

      - 最近、{運動} 不足 だ から、ちょっと {走り} に 行こう か な。

    english_literally: Lately, because of lack of exercise, maybe I will go to run a little.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最近、運動 不足 だ から、少し 走り に で も 行こう か な。
        english: Lately, I'm out of shape, so maybe I'll go for a run or something.
        hint: 「走りにでも」 implies a casual, less committed intention or suggesting an option. We're looking
          for a more direct expression of the intention to go for a run.
    scene: A person considers their health and decides to start exercising.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「運動不足」 is a compound noun where 「運動」 (undō - exercise) is paired with 「不足」 (fusoku - lack).
      「走り」 is the masu-stem of 「走る」 (hashiru), which nominalizes the action of 'running'. When used with
      「に行く」, it specifies the purpose of going somewhere is 'to run'. The phrase 「行こうかな」 conveys a reflective,
      somewhat tentative decision.
  - english: Shall we dance?

          - 一緒 に 踊り ませ ん か？

          in this social context.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 踊り ましょう か？
        english: Shall we dance? (proposing)
        hint: While 「踊りましょうか」 is also an invitation, 「踊りませんか」 explicitly seeks agreement or suggests an
          action, fitting a slightly more engaging and suggestive tone.
    scene: A man at a dance club approaches a woman he is interested in.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「踊り」 is the masu-stem of 「踊る」 (odoru - to dance). The phrase 「踊りませんか」 is a polite and common
      way to invite someone to dance. It effectively nominalizes the action of dancing to propose it as
      a shared activity. This showcases the masu-stem's use in forming invitations, and when spoken by
      a male to a female in this context, it can carry a flirty nuance.
  - english: I ate too much yesterday, so my stomach hurts today.
    japanese:
      - 昨日、{食べ} 過ぎ て、今日 お腹 が 痛い。
      - 昨日、{食べ} 過ぎ て、今日 お腹 が 痛い です。

          - 昨日、たくさん 食べ た から、今日 お腹 が 痛い。
        english: I ate a lot yesterday, so my stomach hurts today.
        hint: 「たくさん食べた」 simply states that one ate a lot. We're looking for an expression that specifically
          means 'too much', implying an excessive amount.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日、過食 し て、今日 お腹 が 痛い。
        english: Yesterday, I overate, so my stomach hurts today.
        hint: 「過食 (kashoku)」 is a more formal or clinical term for overeating. We're looking for a common,
          everyday expression for eating 'too much'.
    scene: A person regrets their indulgence from the previous day.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「食べ」 is the masu-stem of 「食べる」 (taberu - to eat). When combined with 「過ぎ」 (sugi - excessive),
      it forms the noun 「食べ過ぎ」, meaning 'overeating' or 'eating too much'. The 「～て」 form connects this
      action to the resulting stomach ache. This is a common and natural way to express the consequence
      of overindulgence.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, the Verb[masu-stem]+Noun construction is incredibly
  versatile. It allows you to create precise, nuanced expressions by treating actions or states as conceptual
  entities. Mastering this pattern will greatly enhance your ability to express yourself naturally and
  concisely in Japanese.
