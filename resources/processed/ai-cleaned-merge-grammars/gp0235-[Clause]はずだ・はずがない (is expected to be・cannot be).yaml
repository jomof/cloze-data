jlpt: N4
etymology: The word 「はず」 comes from the kanji 「筈」, which originally referred to the notched end of an
  arrow that fits onto the bowstring. From this literal meaning, it evolved to imply something that is
  supposed to fit or be in a certain way, hence its current usage to express expectation or certainty.
  Conversely, 「はずがない」 essentially means something is 'not supposed to be' or 'cannot be' in a certain
  state due to a logical impossibility, meaning it doesn't 'fit' the logical framework.
writeup: |-
  「はずだ」 expresses a strong expectation or conviction that something is true or will happen, based on reason or evidence. When the speaker uses 「はずだ」, they are not merely guessing, but stating a proposition based on reliable information or knowledge. It conveys a higher degree of certainty than a mere guess but doesn't imply absolute proof. Think of it as "it's supposed to be" or "it's expected that". It functions as a dependent noun, so it's often followed by 「だ」 or 「です」. You can use 「はずだ」 after verbs, adjectives, and nouns in their plain forms to express this expectation. Despite 「はずだ」 sometimes being translated as 'should', this is only when you think that something 'should be true', and cannot be used when making suggestions or giving advice. Due to this, 'bound' is often the more accurate translation in most situations. The 「だ」 (or 「です」) in 「はずだ」 may be omitted, especially in casual speech. This usually makes 「はず」 sound a little less certain, similar to adding 「多分」 to the end of a sentence, indicating the speaker is not 100% certain about the accuracy of what they just said.

  In contrast, 「はずがない」 conveys that a certain outcome or situation is logically impossible or highly improbable given known facts or common sense. While often translated as 'hardly possible' or 'unlikely,' its nuance is stronger than those English terms might suggest for logical impossibility. It indicates that a particular state or outcome simply **cannot** be the reality. It is frequently used to express a firm logical conclusion based on given circumstances. It is important to distinguish 「はずがない」 from 「ないはずだ」. While both involve a negative expectation, 「はずがない」 asserts a **logical impossibility** or extreme improbability. For example, if you know someone is a vegetarian, you would say 「彼が肉を食べるはずがない」(He can't possibly eat meat). On the other hand, 「ないはずだ」 expresses a **strong expectation or belief that something is not true**, but it doesn't necessarily imply a logical impossibility. For example, 「財布を忘れたはずはない」(I shouldn't have forgotten my wallet) indicates the speaker believes they didn't forget it, but it's not logically impossible that they did.

    meaning: Is not impossible, it doesn't mean that it isn't
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「はずがない」, which states something is logically improbable, 「ないことはない」 suggests that something
      is potentially possible, though perhaps unlikely, expressing a double negative.
    grammar_point: ないことはない (not impossible)
  - term: ことはない
    meaning: There is no need to, never happens
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「はずがない」 asserts something is logically impossible, 「ことはない」 means there is no need to

    grammar_point: ようがない・ようもない (no way to)
  - term: ものか
    meaning: Definitely not, absolutely not, impossible, do you really think~?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Both 「はずがない」 and 「ものか」 express strong negation. However, 「ものか」 often carries a more emotional,
      emphatic, or rhetorical tone, expressing a firm refusal or disbelief, whereas 「はずがない」 is more about
      logical deduction.

post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  Many expressions convey ideas related to expectation or necessity. It is crucial to distinguish 「はずだ」, which expresses a logical expectation based on evidence, from those that express intention (つもりだ), obligation (べきだ), desire (たらいい), or general tendencies (ものだ).

  To avoid confusion, remember that 「はずがない」 asserts that something is logically not possible or not the expected outcome based on reasoning. If you want to express a high probability or expectation, use 「はずだ」. If you want to explain a reason or natural consequence, use 「わけだ」. If you want to indicate there is no need or that something rarely happens, use 「ことはない」. If you want to clarify that something is not always the case, use 「わけではない」. If you want to indicate there is no possible way to do something, use 「ようがない」. If you want to convey a strong, emotional denial, use 「ものか」. If you want to say something is unlikely based on appearance or impression, use 「そうもない」. 「わけがない」 is often interchangeable with 「はずがない」 but can sometimes imply a more direct or common sense denial. Always consider the nuance of certainty and the source of the information or reasoning.

    japanese:
      - 今日 は 雨 が 降る {はず だ}
      - 今日 は 雨 が 降る {はず です}
      - 今日 は 雨 が 降る {はず}
    english_literally: Today rain falls expected to be.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 雨 が 降る {だろう}
        english: It will probably rain today.
        hint: 「だろう」 indicates a weaker, more speculative prediction. We're looking for a strong expectation
          based on evidence.
    scene: Someone stating a weather forecast with confidence.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「はずだ」 indicates a strong expectation based on some form of reliable information or evidence,
      like a weather forecast.
    etymology: The concept of 'はず' implying logical expectation likely stems from its origin as the 'nock'
      of an arrow. Just as an arrow 'should' fly true from the nock, events 'should' unfold as expected
      based on logical conditions. This sentence uses 'はずだ' to express a prediction based on reliable
      information, much like an archer expects a well-nocked arrow to hit its target.
  - english: It should be faster to go by Shinkansen.
    japanese:

        english: I think it's faster to go by Shinkansen.
        hint: 「と思う」 expresses a personal opinion or thought. We're looking for a statement based on a
          logical expectation or common knowledge.
    scene: Two friends discussing the best way to travel to a destination, based on their understanding
      of transportation options.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「はずだ」 here implies the speaker's belief based on general knowledge about Shinkansen, indicating
      a reasoned expectation.
    etymology: The phrase 「はずだ」 conveys an expectation rooted in reason or evidence. In this context,
      the expectation of Shinkansen being faster is based on common knowledge about its speed and efficiency,
      making it a logical inference. This aligns with the etymological sense of 'はず' as something that
      'fits' or is 'as it should be' based on logical reasoning.
  - english: He hates fish, so he should hate sushi.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 魚 が 嫌い だ から 寿司 は 嫌い な {はず だ}

          - 彼 は 魚 が 嫌い だ から 寿司 は 嫌い {か も しれ ない}
        english: He dislikes fish, so he might dislike sushi.
        hint: 「かもしれない」 expresses possibility but with less certainty. We're looking for a strong deduction
          based on clear information.
    scene: Two people making a logical deduction about a third person's preferences based on known information.
    register: casual
    setting: persuasive
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The speaker uses 「はずだ」 to infer someone's preference based on their known dislike of fish,
      presenting a logical conclusion rather rather than a mere guess.
    etymology: Here, 「はずだ」 is used to express a logical deduction, where 'A leads to B.' The etymology
      of 'はず' as the 'nock' of an arrow, ensuring it points correctly, can be seen in the idea of a conclusion
      that logically 'points' to the truth, given the premises. Knowing his dislike for fish, the conclusion
      that he dislikes sushi is a logical 'fit'.
  - english: This dress should suit me, you know.
    japanese:
      - この ドレス、私 に 似合う {はず よ}
      - この ドレス、私 に 似合う {はず です よ}

          belief.
    scene: A woman trying on a dress, seeking reassurance from a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The use of the final particle 「よ」 in this context, conveying a sense of gentle assurance or
      expectation, is a common feature in female speech patterns. It makes the statement sound softer
      and more feminine.
    etymology: The use of 「はず」 implies a reasonable expectation, perhaps based on the speaker's body shape,
      style preferences, or past experiences with similar dresses. The final particle 「よ」 (yo) softens
      the assertion, making it less direct, a common linguistic strategy for female speakers in Japanese
      to convey warmth and seek engagement. The combination implies 'I expect this to suit me, and I'm
      sharing this with you for confirmation'.
  - english: If I do it, it should finish quickly.
    japanese:
      - 俺 が やれ ば、すぐ に 終わる {はず だ}

          one's own capability.
    scene: A man confidently taking on a task, assuring others of his capability.
    register: casual
    setting: persuasive
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of the casual and assertive male pronoun 「俺」 (ore) clearly indicates a male speaker,
      conveying confidence and personal conviction.
    etymology: The use of 「はずだ」 here reflects a strong personal conviction based on one's own ability
      and experience. The etymological link to the 'nock' of an arrow, which ensures it points correctly,
      can be seen in the speaker's belief that his intervention will ensure the task's swift completion,
      as it 'should' happen given his competence.
  - english: I'm pretty sure I ordered coffee, but tea came.
    japanese:
      - 頼ん だ の は コーヒー の {はず だっ た} けど、お 茶 が 来 た

      - 頼ん だ の は コーヒー の {はず だっ た} ん だ けど、お 茶 が 来 た

          - 頼ん だ の は コーヒー だっ た {だろう} けど、お 茶 が 来 た
        english: I suppose what I ordered was coffee, but tea came.
        hint: 「だろう」 indicates a weaker past assumption or inference. We're looking for a strong past expectation
          that was then contradicted.
    scene: A customer expresses surprise and mild confusion after receiving the wrong order at a cafe.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「はずだった」 indicates the speaker's past expectation, which was not met, conveying a sense of
      surprise or mild frustration at the unfulfilled expectation.
    etymology: The past form 「はずだった」 conveys a past expectation that was not realized, creating a sense
      of discrepancy or surprise. This is a common function of 'はず' when something that 'should have been'
      turns out to be otherwise. The situation highlights the gap between what was reasonably expected
      and what actually occurred, leading to the mild humor.
  - english: Harry is going to the party today... I think.
    japanese:
      - ハリー も 今日 の パーティー に 行く…{はず}

    english_literally: Harry too today's party to go... expected to be.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ハリー も 今日 の パーティー に 行く {らしい}
        english: Harry seems to be going to today's party.
        hint: 「らしい」 expresses information based on what you've heard or observed, implying some uncertainty.
          We're looking for a statement of logical expectation, even if softened.
    scene: Friends casually discussing plans, one person expresses slight uncertainty about Harry's attendance.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: Omitting the copula 「だ」 after 「はず」 softens the certainty, making it more like a casual guess
      or a tentative expectation, often used when reflecting out loud or expressing slight doubt.
    etymology: The omission of 「だ」 after 「はず」 makes the statement more tentative and reflective, signaling
      a slight reduction in certainty or a more casual, internalized thought. This aligns with a nuanced
      understanding of 'はず' where its core meaning of 'expected' can be modulated to express varying degrees
      of conviction, from strong belief to gentle supposition.
  - english: I turned off all the lights in my house before I left... I'm pretty sure.
    japanese:
      - 出かける 前 に 家 の 中 の 電気 は 全部 消し た…{はず}
      - 出かける 前 に 家 の 中 の 電気 は 全部 消し た {はず だ}
      - 出かける 前 に 家 の 中 の 電気 は 全部 消し た {はず です}
    english_literally: Before going out house inside's lights all turned off... expected to be.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 出かける 前 に 家 の 中 の 電気 は 全部 消し た {と 思う}
        english: I think I turned off all the lights in my house before I left.
        hint: 「と思う」 expresses a personal thought or belief. We're looking for a statement of strong expectation,
          even if momentarily doubted.
    scene: Someone standing at the door, having a moment of self-doubt about whether they left the lights
      on.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The trailing 「はず」 without 「だ」 expresses a slight doubt about a past action, characteristic
      of a momentary reflection or a check of one's memory, implying a weakened sense of certainty.
    etymology: Similar to the previous example, the omission of 「だ」 after 「はず」 softens the assertion,
      transforming a strong expectation into a tentative reflection or a self-check. This usage allows
      for the expression of a logical expectation that is momentarily being questioned or re-verified,
      fitting the cautious scenario.
  - english: It should be sunny tomorrow, so let's go on a picnic.
    japanese:

        english: It will probably be sunny tomorrow, so let's go for a picnic.
        hint: 「だろう」 expresses a general probability. We're looking for a strong expectation based on clear
          information, like a forecast.
    scene: Friends planning an outdoor activity, checking the weather forecast to confirm.
    register: casual
    setting: optimistic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「はずだ」 expresses an expectation based on a logical deduction or evidence (e.g., weather forecast),
      leading to a confident suggestion for an activity.
    etymology: The use of 「はずだ」 here signifies an expectation based on a reliable source, such as a weather
      forecast, leading to an optimistic plan. The 'はず' conveys that the sunny weather is a logical and
      anticipated outcome, aligning with its core meaning of something that 'fits' or 'should be' in a
      predictable way.

      of natural laws for humans.
  - english: Someone who has never studied Japanese cannot possibly understand this advanced newspaper

        hint: This is a simple statement of inability. We're looking for a phrase that implies it's logically
          impossible due to lack of prerequisite knowledge.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 語 を 全く 勉強 し た こと が ない 人 に、この 新聞 記事 が 理解 でき {そう も ない}。
        english: It doesn't seem like a person who has never studied Japanese at all can understand this
          newspaper article.

    scene: A tutor explaining to a beginner student why a certain text is too difficult for them.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Highlights the logical impossibility due to a lack of prerequisite knowledge or skill. The
      use of 「全く～ない」 emphasizes the complete absence of prior study, making the inability to comprehend
      the advanced text a logical certainty. This phrasing is firm but supportive in a teaching context.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the nuances of 「はずだ」 is key to expressing a justified expectation
  rather than a mere guess. Pay attention to the context and the speaker's certainty level. Conversely,
  「はずがない」 expresses a logical conclusion that a certain outcome is not the case, or that it is highly
  improbable. It's not a mere guess, but a firm conviction based on known facts or reasoning. The logical
  basis is key to its usage.
