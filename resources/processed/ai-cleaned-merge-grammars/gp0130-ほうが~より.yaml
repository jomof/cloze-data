        "usage-context": "Used to explicitly compare two items, actions, or qualities, highlighting the superiority or preference of one over the other. The 「より」 part can be omitted if the comparison is clear from context.",
        "function": "To express a comparative degree or preference.",
        "nuance": "The explicit use of 「ほうが」 places emphasis on the item or action that is presented as superior or preferred. It's often used when expressing a subjective opinion or a clear factual difference. Omitting 「より」 makes the comparison more subtle or assumes the listener already knows the comparison point."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「ほう」 (方) originally refers to a 'side' or 'direction'. In this grammatical context, it evolved to denote 'on the side of' or 'the side of X', thereby indicating one of two compared entities. 「より」 functions as a comparative particle, akin to 'from' or 'than' in English, signifying the point of comparison or origin. Together, 「ほうが~より」 forms a structure that explicitly highlights one 'side' (ほう) as being superior or different 'from' (より) the other, establishing a direct comparative relationship.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ほうが~より」 is fundamental for making comparisons in Japanese, as the language does not rely on inflected comparative forms for adjectives and adverbs like English does (e.g., 'bigger', 'faster'). Instead, it uses this explicit structural pattern to express that one entity, action, or quality (X) is 'more' of something than another (Y).\n\n**Structure and Usage:**\n\n*   **XのほうがYより [Adjective/Adverb/Predicate]**: This is the most common form, directly comparing two nouns. The particle 「の」 after X is essential for linking the noun to 「ほう」.\n\n*   **Verb/い-adjective (plain form) ほうが Verb/い-adjective (plain form) より [Predicate]**: Used to compare two actions or states. The plain form of the verb or い-adjective directly precedes 「ほうが」.\n\n*   **な-adjective stem な/だった ほうが な-adjective stem な より [Predicate]**: Used for comparing qualities expressed by な-adjectives. Note the use of 「な」 or 「だった」 before 「ほうが」 to maintain the adjectival connection.\n\n*   **Noun である/だった ほうが Noun である より [Predicate]**: Used for comparing identities or roles. 「である」 (or its past form 「だった」) connects the noun to 「ほうが」.\n\n**Omitting 「より」:**\n\nThe 「より」 part can often be omitted if the context makes the comparison clear. For example, if you've already established what you're comparing something *to*, you can simply state 「Xのほうがいい」 (X is better) without needing to re-state the Y.\n\n**Nuance of 「ほうが」:**\n\nThe inclusion of 「ほうが」 explicitly emphasizes the \"side\" that is superior or preferred. This makes the comparison more assertive and can convey the speaker's personal preference or a strong factual statement. Without 「ほうが」, a sentence like 「XはYより[Predicate]」 can still express a comparison, but it's often more neutral, simply stating a difference rather than highlighting one side's superiority or choice.",
