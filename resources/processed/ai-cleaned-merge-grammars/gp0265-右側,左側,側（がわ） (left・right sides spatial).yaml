        "nuance": "Emphasizes a distinct 'face', 'plane', or 'flank' of an object or space, differentiating it from merely 'left' or 'right'. It implies a defined boundary or surface.",
        "grammatical-role": "Often acts as a noun modifier when combined with another noun (e.g., 窓{側}の席 - window-side seat), or as part of a location phrase (e.g., {右側}に - on the right side)."
    },
    "etymology": "The character 側 (ソク, gawa) originally depicted a person standing next to a wall, signifying \"side\" or \"flank.\" It inherently carries the meaning of being adjacent to or a specific face of something. This explains its use in expressions like 右側 (right side) or 左側 (left side), where it denotes a defined boundary or surface of an object or space. Over time, its usage extended to broader spatial and even abstract \"sides\" or \"parties.\"",
    "writeup": "側 (がわ), pronounced \"gawa,\" is a versatile noun and suffix used to indicate a \"side\" or \"flank.\" When used independently, it can refer to a general side, as in 両{側} (りょうがわ, both sides). More commonly, it is affixed to a direction, like 右 (みぎ, right) or 左 (ひだり, left), to form 右{側} (みぎがわ, right side) and 左{側} (ひだりがわ, left side). It can also attach to other nouns to specify a particular side, such as 窓{側} (まどがわ, window side) or 駅{側} (えきがわ, station side).\nThe core nuance of 側 is to designate a **specific face, plane, or region** of an object or area. This differentiates it from simply stating 右 or 左, which indicate direction or general location without emphasizing the \"side\" as a distinct boundary. For instance, 右にあります (It's on the right) is a general location, whereas 右{側}にあります (It's on the right side) points to a particular face or section.\n側 is widely used in everyday conversation and formal settings, making it an essential component for precise spatial descriptions. It is grammatically neutral and can be used by speakers of all genders and ages.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When describing locations, understanding the subtle differences between 側 and similar terms is crucial. While 右 and 左 indicate general direction, 右側 and 左側 specifically refer to a designated surface or area on that side of an object or area. 横 implies a horizontal dimension or being directly beside something, often used for flat surfaces or items positioned horizontally. In contrast, 隣 strictly means \"next to\" another distinct item. 方 and 方面 both indicate a general direction or a broader area, often used for a general vicinity or route. Choosing 側 accurately conveys that you are referring to one of the defined faces or boundaries of an entity, rather than just a general direction, an adjacent object, a general vicinity, or a broad route.",

The seventh option, カフェ は 駅 の {左側} だ, is also a plain form, often used for more direct, declarative statements in casual conversation. The eighth option, 駅 の {左側} に カフェ が ある, places more emphasis on the existence of the cafe on that side, while the ninth option, 駅 の {左側} に カフェ が あります, is its polite counterpart, maintaining the emphasis on location. The colloquial あんじゃん in 駅 の {左側} に カフェ あんじゃん is common among younger male speakers, expressing surprise or confirmation. 駅 の {左側} でございます is a very polite and formal way to state location, often used in customer service. 駅 の {左側} に カフェ が ある わ よ adds the feminine particle わ and the assertive よ, making it friendly and slightly emphatic, common for female speakers. 駅 の {左側} に カフェ が あり ます から ね provides an explanatory or confirming tone, often used when guiding someone. 駅 の {左側} に カフェ が ございまして is a formal and continuous phrase, often used to introduce further description."

The casual versions, 遊んで た and 遊んで た よ, reflect a more intimate or reflective tone, typical when narrating to oneself or in casual conversation. 子供たち は 川 {側} で 遊んで いた offers a simpler plain past narrative, often used in casual storytelling. The version 川 {側} で 子供たち が 楽しそう に 遊んで いた emphasizes the location first before introducing the subject and action, common in descriptive narratives. Adding よ to 遊んで いましたよ makes the statement more empathetic or confirmatory, often used when sharing a recollection that the listener might also relate to. The addition of んだ to 遊んで たんだ provides an explanatory or emphatic nuance, as if providing context or a deeper feeling behind the observation. 子供たち は 川 {側} で 楽しそう に 走り回って いました emphasizes running around, which is a common form of play for children. 川 {側} で 子供たち は 楽しげ に 遊ん でいた uses 楽しげ に, a slightly more formal or literary adverb for 'happily'. 子供たち は 川 {側} で 元気 に 遊ん で いました highlights the children's energetic play."

    "post_example_writeup": "The examples illustrate how 側 can be used to precisely define a location as a specific 'side' or 'flank' of an object or area, distinguishing it from general directions or mere adjacency. It also shows its versatility in referring to abstract 'sides' or 'parties' in discussions or relationships.
