    "writeup": "The particle に indicates frequency. It describes how often something happens or is done within a specific timeframe. The structure is straightforward: [Timeframe] + に + [Number of Times] + [Action]. に retains its basic meaning of indicating a \"goal\" or \"destination,\" but in this context, it signifies the period within which the action occurs.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Do not confuse this use of に with で in relation to time. で expresses the *duration* it takes to do something. に expresses the *frequency* of an action within a time period.\n*   に marks portions of time within a larger timeframe, whereas で marks a whole span of time within which something is completed.",

For instance, 「2年間 {で} 50万円貯めた」 (I saved 500,000 yen *in* two years) specifies the total amount saved during that two-year period, not a frequency of saving.

        "violation: Removed 'etymology' field from example 2. Rule 6 states: 'If there is something etymologically interesting in the Japanese sentence, then mention it here in English.' The previous content related to JLPT kanji level, not etymology.",
        "violation: Modified example 1's Japanese from '一ヶ月' to '一か月に' and example 2's Japanese from '歯を磨かない' to '顔を洗わない'. Rule 6 states: 'Example sentences should use kanji appropriate for the JLPT level of the grammar point.' This change avoids N1 and N2 kanji respectively, which are above the N4 JLPT level.",

Rule 6 states: 'If there is a \"speaker_gender\", then \"nuance\" **must** mention the specific Japanese, in 「quotes」, that would only be spoken by that gender.' The previous nuance was too vague about the Japanese specific to gender, and the updated nuance clarifies the absence of masculine markers.",

Rule 8 states: 'At least one example should suit an early romantic or first-meeting context (without using the word \"date\").' This new example fulfills both requirements.",
        "violation: Added a 'post_example_writeup'. Rule 13 states: 'You may include a \"post_example_writeup\" section after \"examples\" if more clarification is helpful'. This section clarifies the important distinction between 'に' (frequency) and 'で' (duration), which was implicitly present in the original Bunpro input's examples but not directly in the grammar point examples."
