    "writeup": "The particle に, when used with time expressions, indicates frequency. It describes how often something happens or is done within a specific timeframe. The structure is straightforward: **[Timeframe] + に + [Number of Times] + [Action]**. に retains its basic meaning of indicating a \"goal\" or \"destination,\" but in this context, it signifies the period within which the action occurs. For example, in 「一日 に 三回」 (three times a day), 「一日」 is the timeframe, and 「三回」 is the number of occurrences.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Do not confuse this use of に with で in relation to time. で expresses the *duration* it takes to do something, or the total amount of time something is expected to take. For example, 「三時間 で 本を読んだ」 (I read a book in three hours) implies completion within that duration. In contrast, に expresses the *frequency* of an action within a time period.\n*   に marks portions (or points) of time within a larger timeframe, within which something happens. However, で marks a whole span of time, within which something can be completed or takes place.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ごとに」 and 「おきに」 can express similar ideas of frequency, 「に」 is generally the most straightforward way to indicate how many times something happens within a specific timeframe. Use 「ごとに」 when you want to emphasize each individual instance and 「おきに」 when you specifically mean 'every other' or 'at set intervals'. The particle 「で」 is often confused with 「に」 when discussing time, but it focuses on the total duration or completion within a period, not the frequency of an action.
