    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 generally marks a location or time. In this case, it marks a point within a timeframe at which something occurs a certain number of times. Think of it as \"within\" or \"during\" the specified period, where the action takes place or occurs a certain number of times.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」, when used with time expressions, indicates frequency. It describes how often something happens or is done within a specific timeframe. The structure is straightforward: **[Timeframe] + に + [Number of Times] + [Action]**. 「に」 retains its basic meaning of indicating a \"goal\" or \"destination,\" but in this context, it signifies the period within which the action occurs. For example, in 「一日 に 三回」 (three times a day), 「一日」 is the timeframe, and 「三回」 is the number of occurrences.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Do not confuse this use of 「に」 with 「で」 in relation to time. 「で」 expresses the *duration* it takes to do something, or the total amount of time something is expected to take. For example, 「三時間 で 本を読んだ」 (I read a book in three hours) implies completion within that duration. In contrast, 「に」 expresses the *frequency* of an action within a time period.\n*   「に」 marks portions (or points) of time within a larger timeframe, within which something happens. However, 「で」 marks a whole span of time, within which something can be completed or takes place.",
