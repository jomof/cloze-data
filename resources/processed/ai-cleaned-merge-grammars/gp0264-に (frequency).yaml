    "writeup": "The particle に indicates frequency. It describes how often something happens or is done within a specific timeframe. The structure is straightforward: [Timeframe] + に + [Number of Times] + [Action]. に retains its basic meaning of indicating a \"goal\" or \"destination,\" but in this context, it signifies the period within which the action occurs.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Do not confuse this use of に with で in relation to time. で expresses the *duration* it takes to do something. に expresses the *frequency* of an action within a time period.\n*   に marks portions of time within a larger timeframe, whereas で marks a whole span of time within which something is completed.",
