writeup: 「と言うと」 is a versatile phrase used to express what comes to mind or what association arises when
  a particular noun or situation is mentioned. It functions similarly to saying "speaking of..." or "when
  you say...". It indicates an immediate and often involuntary connection between the topic and the associated
  thought or image. This connection can be a memory, a typical characteristic, a stereotype, or even a
  reaction. It can also be used to introduce a situation and its typical consequence, or to highlight
  how a statement might be perceived, sometimes ironically.

      involuntary association, typical outcome, or the perception created by something.
    grammar_point: と言えば (speaking of)
  - term: となると
    meaning: If it comes to (the point where); when it comes to (that situation)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「となると」 implies a logical conclusion or a shift in state based on a preceding situation or
      fact. It leads to a consequence or deduction. In contrast, 「と言うと」 is about an immediate association,
      a typical reaction, or how something is generally perceived when it's mentioned.
    grammar_point: となると (when it comes to)
  - term: と来たら
    meaning: When it comes to..., Concerning...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「と来たら」 often expresses a slightly negative or exasperated tone when referring to someone or

  - term: と言ったら
    meaning: When it comes to; as for (often implying surprise or extremity)
    kind: similar expression

      or introduces something notable about it. It can carry a more emotional or emphatic tone than 「と言うと」.

      on the degree or impact of the thing itself.
    grammar_point: ったら・といったら (extreme degree)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key difference lies in the nuance of the connection being made. 「と言うと」
  highlights an immediate, often involuntary association or a typical consequence, often leading to a
  specific reaction or common thought upon hearing a word or phrase. 「と言えば」, on the other hand, often
  serves to introduce a related topic or shift the conversation, suggesting a broader connection to the
  previous discussion rather than a direct, instantaneous mental link. 「となると」 signifies a logical progression
  or deduction from a given circumstance, focusing on what logically follows if a certain condition is
  met or situation arises. Meanwhile, 「と言ったら」 often emphasizes the surprising or extreme nature of something
  related to the mentioned topic, conveying a strong emotional or emphatic tone. Lastly, 「と来たら」 typically
  introduces a person or thing that is the subject of complaint or exasperation, highlighting a characteristic
  behavior often viewed negatively.

        hint: While similar, 「と言えば」 might introduce a broader range of topics. 「と言うと」 emphasizes the immediate,
          almost automatic association that comes to mind when Kyoto is mentioned. We're looking for the
          very first thing that pops into one's head.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 京都 は 美しい お 寺 や 伝統 的 な 庭園 が ある。
        english: Kyoto has beautiful temples and traditional gardens.
        hint: This is a simple factual statement. 「と言うと」 describes the specific mental image or association
          that is immediately evoked upon hearing the word 'Kyoto'.
    scene: A travel agent talking to a client about popular tourist destinations.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: This sentence illustrates how 「と言うと」 can introduce the most prominent or iconic association
      with a place. 「まず」 (first) and 「頭に浮かぶ」 (comes to mind) emphasize the immediacy and strength of this
      connection, highlighting the direct mental link upon hearing 'Kyoto'.
post_example_writeup: 「と言うと」 is most often used to highlight an immediate, often involuntary, association
  or reaction to a topic. It can describe what naturally comes to mind, or how a statement is typically
  perceived, sometimes with a nuance of irony or overstatement. The phrase sets up an expectation based
  on the initial mention, which can then be fulfilled or contradicted. It effectively conveys the direct
  impact or mental trigger caused by a noun or a statement.
