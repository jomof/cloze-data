        "function": "expresses speaker's intention or decision"
    },
    "etymology": "「よう」 is the volitional form ending of verbs, expressing intent or volition. 「思う」(omou) means \"to think.\" Together, they create a phrase indicating the speaker's intention or consideration of doing something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[volitional-よう] + ようと思う」 is used to express the speaker's intention or decision to do something. It's a way of saying \"I think I will,\" or \"I'm thinking of doing something.\"\n\n*   **Volitional Form:** This is created by changing the verb ending. For example, 「食べる」 (taberu, to eat) becomes 「食べよう」 (tabeyou, let's eat). For verbs ending in 「う」, change to 「お」 then add 「う」. For verbs ending in 「る」, drop the 「る」 and add 「よう」. Irregular verbs: 「する」 becomes 「しよう」 and 「くる」 becomes 「こよう」.\n*   **Negative Form:** To express the intention *not* to do something, use 「Verb[dictionary-form] + まいと思う」. Note that 「まい」 is an archaic negative volitional form.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   When the subject is someone other than the speaker, use 「～と思っている」 instead. 「ようと思う」 is specifically for expressing *your* intentions, or the intentions of others when directly observed or inferred with high certainty (in which case 「～と思っている」 is still more natural).\n*   This grammar is typically used for future actions that the speaker has been considering, not for spontaneous decisions.",
