    "etymology": "The origins of ある are ancient, tracing back to the early stages of the Japanese language. It evolved from a concept of physical presence or location, solidifying over time into its current meaning as a verb indicating existence.",
    "writeup": "The verb **ある** indicates the existence of inanimate objects, abstract concepts, or locations. It can also express possession of something that isn't a living being. Its polite form is **あります**, commonly used in formal speech. Conversely, **ない** or **ありません** signifies non-existence or lack of possession.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish **ある** from **いる**, which is reserved for the existence of animate beings (people and animals).\n\nWhen indicating location, **ある** is used with the particle 「に」 or 「には」 to specify where the inanimate object exists. For possession, **ある** is often used with 「が」, sometimes with 「には」, where the possessor is marked by 「に」, or less commonly, 「が」.\n\nWhile **ある** can denote possession, especially of abstract concepts or things that are generally \"had\" rather than physically \"held,\" the verb **持っている** (motteiru) is more frequently used for the physical possession or ownership of tangible items.",
