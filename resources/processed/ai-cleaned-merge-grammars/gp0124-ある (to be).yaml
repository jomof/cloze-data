    "etymology": "The verb 「ある」 has ancient roots in the Japanese language, tracing back to the Old Japanese period. Its core meaning has consistently revolved around existence. It's related to the verb 「在る」 which is a more formal way to write it, implying a state of being or location.",

It's the counterpart to 「いる」, which is used for animate objects (people and animals). 「ある」 can also mean \"to have\" when referring to possession of an object. The polite form is 「あります」. It is a **Group 1** verb, which means that it uses the -u verb conjugation rules.",
