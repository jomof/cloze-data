    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なくて」 is formed by combining the negative form of a verb or adjective (ない) with the 「て」 form, which is commonly used to connect clauses or express a sequence of actions. Specifically, it's derived from the 「ない」 ending changing to 「なく」 before being joined with 「て」.  Thus, 「なくて」 literally means \"not\" + \"and\", conveying a negative conjunction.",
    "writeup": "The 「なくて」 conjunction in Japanese combines 「ない」 (not) with the 「て」 form to express 'not (A), and...'. It's used to connect clauses, indicating a reason, cause, or sequence of events in the negative. There are two forms of 「ない」: an auxiliary verb for verbs, and an い-adjective for nouns and adjectives.  With nouns and な-adjectives, use 「ではなくて」 or 「じゃなくて」.\n\nIt's **important** to distinguish 「なくて」 from 「ないで」. While both express negation, 「ないで」 typically means \"without doing,\" while 「なくて」 often indicates reasons or causes.",
