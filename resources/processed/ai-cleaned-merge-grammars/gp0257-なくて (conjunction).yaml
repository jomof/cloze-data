        "nuance": "While similar to the plain negative form followed by から or ので (which also indicate cause/reason), なくて tends to feel slightly more direct or a statement of fact without necessarily emphasizing the causality as strongly. It can also simply link two negative statements without a strong causal relationship."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なくて」 is formed by combining the negative form of a verb or adjective (ない) with the 「て」 form, which is commonly used to connect clauses or express a sequence of actions. Specifically, it's derived from the 「ない」 ending changing to 「なく」 before being joined with 「て」. Thus, 「なくて」 literally means \"not\" + \"and\", conveying a negative conjunction. It evolved from the adverbial form of the classical negative auxiliary ぬ (modern ない), which was に or く, combining with て.",
    "writeup": "The 「なくて」 conjunction in Japanese combines 「ない」 (not) with the 「て」 form to express 'not (A), and...'. It's used to connect clauses, indicating a reason, cause, or sequence of events in the negative. There are two forms of 「ない」: an auxiliary verb used with verbs, and an い-adjective used with other い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns.\n\nFor verbs, the negative form ends in 「ない」, and this 「ない」 then changes to 「なくて」. For example, 「行かない」 (will not go) becomes 「行かなくて」 (will not go, and/or because will not go).\n\nFor い-adjectives, the negative form ends in 「くない」, which changes to 「くなくて」. For example, 「高くない」 (not expensive) becomes 「高くなくて」 (not expensive, and/or because not expensive).\n\nFor な-adjectives and nouns, 「ではない」 or 「じゃない」 is used to form the negative. These then change to 「でなくて」 or 「じゃなくて」 respectively. For example, 「静かではない」 (not quiet) becomes 「静かでなくて」, and 「学生ではない」 (not a student) becomes 「学生でなくて」.\n\nIt's **important** to distinguish 「なくて」 from 「ないで」. While both express negation, 「ないで」 typically means \"without doing,\" emphasizing the absence of an action. In contrast, 「なくて」 often indicates reasons or causes stemming from a negative condition or lack of something. It can also simply list negative facts.",

            "nuance": "While the regular 「て」 form can connect clauses sequentially, 「なくて」 specifically introduces a negative connotation to that connection. 「なくて」 is more about indicating a reason or cause originating from a negative condition or simply linking negative states, whereas the regular 「て」 form links positive or neutral actions/states."
