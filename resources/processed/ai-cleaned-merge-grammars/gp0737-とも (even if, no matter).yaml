    "etymology": "The particle 「とも」 originates from the adverbial use of the noun 「共 (tomo)」, meaning 'together' or 'all.' Its evolution into a concessive particle reflects the idea of including all possibilities, leading to the meaning 'even if' or 'no matter.' This suggests that a certain state or action holds true, encompassing all circumstances, including those that might seem to contradict it.",
    "writeup": "「とも」 is a particle that can function in various grammatical roles, including as a sentence-ending particle, a conjunction particle, or an adverbial particle. Despite these classifications, its core meaning consistently conveys \"even if (A)\" or \"no matter if (A),\" highlighting that \"in spite of (A), still (B)\".\n\nAs a conjunction particle, 「とも」 is typically paired with words that precede the auxiliary verbs 「う」 or 「よう」, indicating a volitional form (e.g., 「行こうとも」, \"even if I go\"). It can also follow the conjunctive form of い-adjectives (e.g., 忙しくとも), where it can mean \"even if busy\" or, in cases like 「少なくとも」, \"at least.\" For a more formal or literary tone with い-adjectives, the `かろう` form can be used, such as 「寒かろうとも」.\n\nWhile 「とも」 can sometimes follow a select number of adverbs, this usage is less common and often part of fixed expressions. It's advisable to observe its usage in native material before actively employing it in such contexts. 「とも」 often appears in formal contexts and is less common in everyday, casual speech. However, certain fixed phrases like 「少なくとも (sukunakutomo)」, meaning \"at least,\" are very common in both written and spoken Japanese. Another example is 「いずれとも (izure tomo)」, meaning \"either (of the two)\" or \"both ways.\"",
