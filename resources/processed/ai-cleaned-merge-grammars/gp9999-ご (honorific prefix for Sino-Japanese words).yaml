  usage-context: Used in polite, formal, respectful, and humble language to show deference or politeness.
    Primarily precedes Sino-Japanese words.
  function: politeness, respect, humility
  nuance: Elevates the status of the listener or the object/action being discussed. Can also denote humility
    when used in kenjōgo forms.
  grammatical-role: honorific marker
etymology: The prefixes お and ご both originate from the honorific language used in the Imperial Court
  and aristocratic society, emphasizing politeness and respect towards the emperor, nobles, and their
  belongings. 「ご」 specifically derives from the Chinese character 御 (go), which also means "control" or
  "manipulate," but was extensively used in Japan as an honorific prefix, especially for words of Chinese
  origin (on'yomi). This usage reflects a historical tendency to incorporate Chinese linguistic elements
  into formal and polite discourse, as Chinese culture often carried prestige.
writeup: '「ご」 is an honorific prefix in Japanese, primarily used with Sino-Japanese words (words derived
  from Chinese, often read with on''yomi). Its main function is to add a layer of politeness, respect,
  or humility to the noun or verb it precedes. This prefix is an essential component of `keigo` (honorific
  language) and is crucial for appropriate communication in various social contexts in Japan. 「ご」 can
  be used in several ways: 1. **As a general politeness marker**: When attached to nouns, it elevates
  the status of the item or concept, showing politeness to the listener. For example, 「ご飯」 (gohan, meal/rice)
  is inherently more polite than just 「飯」 (meshi). 2. **In Sonkeigo (respectful language)**: When forming
  respectful verbs or nouns related to the listener''s or a respected person''s actions or belongings.
  For example, 「ご連絡」 (go-renraku) refers to "your contact" or "the contact made by a respected person."
  3. **In Kenjōgo (humble language)**: When forming humble verbs or nouns related to the speaker''s own
  actions, showing humility towards the listener. For example, 「ご説明」 (go-setsumei) can refer to "my explanation"
  when used humbly. It''s important to differentiate 「ご」 from 「お」, its counterpart. While both are honorific
  prefixes, 「お」 is generally used with native Japanese words (kun''yomi), and 「ご」 is used with Sino-Japanese
  words (on''yomi). However, there are exceptions, and some words can take either, or have fixed forms
  with one or the other (e.g., 「お電話」 is common, though 電話 is Sino-Japanese). Recognizing whether a word
  is Sino-Japanese or native Japanese is key to choosing the correct prefix. Misusing these prefixes can
  sound unnatural or even rude in some contexts.'

  - term: です (polite copula)
    meaning: polite form of the copula 'to be'.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「です」 adds politeness to a sentence ending, 「ご」 adds politeness to specific nouns or
      verb stems within the sentence, indicating respect for the item or action itself. They serve different
      grammatical functions though both contribute to politeness.
    grammar_point: です (polite copula)
  - term: Verb[ます] (polite present)
    meaning: polite form of verbs.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ます」 makes a verb polite, but 「ご」 adds honorific or humble nuance to the verb stem itself,
      particularly when combined with respectful or humble auxiliary verbs (e.g., 「ご覧になる」 vs. 「見ます」).
      「ご」 operates at the lexical level, modifying the noun or verb, while 「ます」 operates at the sentence
      ending, modifying the verb's politeness level.
    grammar_point: Verb[ます] (polite present)
post_false_friends_writeup: The distinction between 「お」 and 「ご」 is fundamental to Japanese honorifics.
  While both elevate the politeness of speech, their usage depends on the origin of the word they precede.
  「お」 is typically for native Japanese words, and 「ご」 for Sino-Japanese words. 「です」 and 「ます」 are sentence-ending
  politeness markers, whereas 「ご」 modifies specific words within the sentence, reflecting respect towards
  the entity or action itself. Mastering these distinctions is crucial for accurate and natural Japanese
  communication.
