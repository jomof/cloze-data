    "etymology": "The expression 「が早いか」 combines the particle 「が」, the adjective 「早い」 (hayai, 'fast' or 'early'), and the question particle 「か」. The nuance is that something happens *so* quickly after something else, it's almost as if it happened *before*.",
    "writeup": "「が早いか」 is a formal expression used to describe two actions that occur in very quick succession. It conveys the sense that 'no sooner did A happen, than B happened.' The verb preceding 「が早いか」 can be in its dictionary (plain non-past) or past plain form. The more literal translation, taking into account the interrogative particle 「か」, is perhaps closer to \"(A) happened, or possibly even sooner, (B) happened.\" This emphasizes the instantaneousness of the second action (B), suggesting that the first action (A) was hardly complete before (B) commenced.\n\nThis construction is used when the first action (A) happens momentarily or has a clearly defined finishing point. For actions without a clear end, verbs like 「終わる」 (owaru, 'to finish') are often linked to the stem form preceding 「が早いか」 to specify the completion. The verb in the second clause (B) will always be in the past tense.\n\nWhile the B action often occurs unexpectedly, it is usually volitional—an intentional action. 「が早いか」 expresses something that has already happened in the past, so it cannot be used to express wishes or intentions for the future. Furthermore, this grammar point is generally not used to highlight the speaker's own impulsive actions, focusing instead on observable events.",

This was done to better demonstrate the flexibility of the grammar point, which can attach to both dictionary and past forms, as stated in the updated 'formation' and 'writeup'.",
