    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the particle が, the adjective 早い (hayai, \"early\" or \"fast\"), and the question particle か (ka). Literally, it implies \"is it early?\" suggesting that the second action occurs almost immediately after the first.",
    "writeup": "**が早いか** expresses that something happens immediately after something else. It conveys a sense of immediacy, often implying the second action is unexpected. The literal translation is \"(A), or possibly sooner, (B)\". This grammar point is formal, so reserve it for writing or formal speech. It follows verbs in dictionary or past tense form, though the **dictionary form is more common**. The verb in the second clause will always be in the past tense. The first action tends to be something momentary or with a clear endpoint, and the second action is often volitional (intentional). Because **が早いか** always expresses something in the past, it can't express future wishes or intentions. Additionally, it does not highlight the speaker's own actions.",
