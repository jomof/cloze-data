    "etymology": "The expression 「が早いか」 combines the particle 「が」, the adjective 「早い」 (hayai, 'fast' or 'early'), and the question particle 「か」. The nuance is that something happens *so* quickly after something else, it's almost as if it happened *before*.",
    "writeup": "「が早いか」 is a formal expression used to describe two actions that occur in very quick succession. It conveys the sense that 'no sooner did A happen, than B happened.' Think of it as highlighting the immediacy between two events. The action described by the verb preceding 「が早いか」 is seen as happening almost instantaneously before the following action. While it can be used with verbs in the past tense, using the **dictionary form** is more common. The verb in the second clause is usually in the past tense. This grammar point is often used in written language and formal speech. 「が早いか」 cannot be used to express wishes or intentions for the future.",
