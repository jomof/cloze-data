        "nuance": "Implies that something is being consciously put out of consideration, usually because it is an exception to a general rule or a factor that is not relevant to the main point being made. It can also be used to highlight a specific point by contrasting it with something being set aside."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「は別として」 combines the topic marker 「は」, the noun 「別 (betsu)」 meaning 'difference, separation, or distinction,' the particle 「と (to)」, and the te-form of the verb 「する (suru)」. The literal meaning is close to 'going ahead with (A) as an exception'.",
    "writeup": "「は別として」 is a versatile phrase used to indicate that a specific element, concept, or condition is being set aside or disregarded from the main topic of discussion. It effectively means \"apart from,\" \"except for,\" or \"whether or not\" a certain condition holds true.\n\nThis structure often highlights that while a particular aspect (A) is acknowledged, the speaker chooses to exclude it from the current focus to emphasize another point. The particle 「は」 functions as a topic marker, reinforcing that (A) is the specific item being singled out for temporary exclusion. This can occur after a noun, or even phrases indicating conditions or choices like 「かどうか」.\n\nOne common usage involves presenting a positive and negative form of a word or phrase, like 「XかXじゃないかは別として」 or 「XかYかは別として」 (where X and Y are contrasting words). This conveys the nuance of \"whether or not\" something is the case, effectively setting aside the uncertainty or dual possibility to focus on what remains. For example, 「給料がいいかどうかは別として、…」 (Setting aside whether the pay is good or not,...) implies that the pay is not the primary concern.\n\nAlthough 「は別として」 functionally removes (A) from the discussion, its core purpose is often to draw attention to (A) as an exception or a factor that, despite being secondary, is still relevant enough to be explicitly mentioned before being set aside.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   While 「は別として」 is standard, occasionally you may encounter 「は別にして」. The nuance difference is subtle: 「と」 often implies a more definitive or objective separation, whereas 「に」 suggests a speaker's intentional act of separating or treating something as an exception. However, in most contexts, they are interchangeable.\n*   This grammar point is widely used across various registers, from casual conversation to formal business discussions, making it a highly adaptable expression.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「は別として」 shares some functional overlap with expressions like 「はともかく」, 「以外は」, 「に関わらず」, 「は関係なく」, and 「〜ない限り」, subtle differences in nuance and usage contexts are crucial. 「は別として」 is generally used when you are explicitly acknowledging a factor but choosing to set it aside for the current discussion, often because it's an exception or not the primary focus. In contrast, 「はともかく」 can carry a more dismissive tone, implying the set-aside item is less important. 「以外は」 denotes a complete exclusion. 「に関わらず」 and 「は関係なく」 express general indifference or lack of connection. 「〜ない限り」 establishes a necessary precondition. Choosing 「は別として」 allows for a nuanced acknowledgment of a factor while directing attention to the main point.",
