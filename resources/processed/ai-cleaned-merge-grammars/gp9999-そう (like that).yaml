formation:
  Verb[stem] + そうだ: Indicates something is 'about to happen' or 'looks like it will happen' based on immediate
    observation. For example, 降る (to fall) becomes 降りそうだ (looks like it will rain).
  い-Adjective[stem] + そうだ: Indicates something 'looks' or 'seems' a certain way based on appearance. The
    final い is dropped. For example, 美味しい (delicious) becomes 美味しそうだ (looks delicious). For いい (good),
    it becomes よさそうだ. For ない (not/there isn't), it becomes なさそうだ.
  な-Adjective[stem] + そうだ: Indicates something 'looks' or 'seems' a certain way based on appearance. The
    な is dropped when directly followed by そうだ. For example, 元気 (healthy/energetic) becomes 元気そうだ (looks
    energetic).
  Plain form (Verb, い-Adj, な-Adj, Noun) + そうだ: Indicates reported speech or hearsay ('I hear that', 'it
    is said that'). The plain form (dictionary, plain past, plain negative) is used. For example, 雨が降るそうだ
    (I hear it will rain), 学生だそうだ (I hear he is a student), 美味しいそうだ (I hear it's delicious).
jlpt: N4
etymology: The grammatical suffix 「そう」, indicating appearance or hearsay, originates from the noun 「様
  (さま)」(sama) meaning 'state' or 'condition'. Over time, it evolved into 「さう」 and then 「そう」, attaching
  to verb and adjective stems to describe the 'state' or 'manner' in which something appears or is heard.
  This evolution allowed for expressions of conjecture based on sensory input or reported information,
  making it a versatile tool for conveying subjective observation or secondhand accounts.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「そう」 is a highly versatile expression in Japanese, primarily used to convey two main meanings: appearance/conjecture and reported speech/hearsay. Understanding which meaning is intended depends on the part of speech it attaches to and whether the plain form or a stem form is used.

  When 「そう」 attaches to the **stem form of verbs and adjectives**, it indicates appearance or conjecture based on direct observation. This means you're making a judgment about something based on what you see, hear, or otherwise perceive directly. For verbs, it often means 'looks like it will [verb]' or 'is about to [verb],' especially with instantaneous actions. For adjectives, it means 'looks [adjective]' or 'seems [adjective].'

  On the other hand, when 「そう」 attaches to the **plain form of verbs, adjectives, or nouns**, it signifies reported speech or hearsay. In this case, it means 'I hear that...' or 'it is said that....' This usage is essentially conveying information that you have heard from someone else or from a source, rather than a direct observation.

  It's crucial to distinguish between these two usages based on the preceding word's form. This distinction is fundamental for correctly interpreting and using 「そう」 in Japanese communication.
false_friends:
  - term: そう (that way・like that)
    meaning: that way; like that; in such a way
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This 「そう」 refers to a manner or state that is evident or previously mentioned, functioning
      as a demonstrative adverb. It does not combine with adjective stems or verb stems to indicate appearance
      or hearsay like the current grammar point. For example, 「そうしてください」 means 'Please do it that way,'
      not 'It seems like you are doing it.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:こう・そう・ああ・どう (like this・that way・how)
  - term: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
    meaning: it seems; it looks like; just like
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「そう」 expresses appearance based on direct observation or reported information, often with
      higher certainty or immediacy. 「ようだ」 and 「みたいだ」 express conjecture based on various cues, implying
      a more indirect or inferential judgment, and can also mean 'just like.' 「そうだ」 is usually more direct.
      For example, '雨が降りそうだ' (It looks like it's going to rain, based on current clouds/feel) versus '雨が降るようだ'
      (It seems it will rain, based on forecast or subtle signs).
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
  - term: らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)
    meaning: it seems; it appears; I hear (based on evidence or reputation)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「らしい」 indicates a conjecture based on objective evidence, reputation, or what is generally
      known, carrying a sense of 'it seems to be the case.' 「そう」 (hearsay) directly reports what was heard,
      while 「そう」 (appearance) is based on visual or sensory observation. 「らしい」 is more about logical inference,
      while 「そう」 (appearance) is more about direct sensory perception, and 「そう」 (hearsay) is about direct
      reporting. For example, '彼は日本人らしい' (He seems Japanese, based on his behavior/appearance) versus
      '彼は日本人だそうだ' (I hear he is Japanese).
    grammar_point: らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)
  - term: 〜ている + そう (often 〜てそう)
    meaning: looks like (someone is) doing ~
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: When 「そう」 is appended to the 「て-form」 of a verb (often contracted from 「〜ている + そう」), it creates
      an expression meaning 'looks like someone is currently doing something.' This is distinct from 「Verb[stem]
      + そう」 (about to do or looks like it will happen). For example, '彼は寝ていそうだ' or '彼は寝てそうだ' (He looks
      like he is sleeping) vs. '彼は寝そうだ' (He looks like he's about to sleep/looks sleepy).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[てい]そう (looks like someone is doing)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「そう」 is useful for expressing appearance, hearsay, and conjecture, it's
  easy to confuse it with other expressions that also convey 'seeming' or 'like.' Pay close attention
  to the form preceding 「そう」 (stem vs. plain) to differentiate between appearance/conjecture and reported
  speech. For instance, 「 Verb[stem] + そう」 implies an immediate observation or an impending action, whereas
  「Plain form + そう」 is about secondhand information. The demonstrative adverb 「そう」 (like in 「そうですね」) is
  entirely distinct in its function and doesn't attach to verb or adjective stems. Understanding these
  nuances will prevent misunderstandings.
examples:
  - english: It looks like it's going to rain.
    japanese:
      - 雨 が {降り そう} です。
      - 雨 が {降り そう} だ。
    english_literally: Rain looks like it will fall.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 が 降る {よう だ}。
        english: It seems it will rain.
        hint: While both convey conjecture, 「ようだ」 suggests a more indirect inference, perhaps based on
          general signs, whereas 「そう」 (stem form) is a more direct visual observation. We're looking for
          a direct observation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 が {降り そう} に 見える。
        english: It looks like it will rain (visually).
        hint: 「〜に見える」 explicitly states 'looks like' focusing on visual appearance, but 「そう」 can often
          imply this directly without the additional verb. We're looking for a more concise expression.

          looking for a direct visual impression.
