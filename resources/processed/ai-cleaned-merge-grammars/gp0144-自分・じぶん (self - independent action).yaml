    "writeup": "**自分 (jibun)** is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence. It emphasizes that the action is done by oneself, for oneself, or belonging to oneself. 「自分」 can carry a nuance of independence or self-reliance, contrasting the subject with others. Consider 「自分で何でもする」 \"to do everything by oneself.\" It can be used in various registers, from casual to formal, depending on the context. Note that while 「自分」 often translates to \"self\" or \"own,\" its usage is more nuanced and context-dependent than a direct translation suggests. 自分 is also commonly used to mean 'oneself'. 「自分の国」 means 'one's own country'.",
