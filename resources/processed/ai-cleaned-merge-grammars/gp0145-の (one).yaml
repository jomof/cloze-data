    "meaning": "Represents a thing or concept already mentioned or understood from context, similar to \"one\" in English.",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Varies depending on the modifier and context. Can range from casual to polite.",
        "Function": "Acts as a dependent indefinite pronoun, replacing a noun or clause to avoid redundancy or refer to an understood entity.",
        "Limitations": "Cannot be used independently; requires a modifier (adjective, verb clause, etc.).",
        "Part of Speech": "Pronoun"
    },
    "etymology": "Derived from the possessive particle 'の', but in this case, it functions as a pronoun, indicating a substitute for a previously mentioned noun. The nuance implies something that has already been established or is understood by both the speaker and the listener.",
    "writeup": "The pronoun 「の」 acts as a substitute for a noun that has already been mentioned or is understood from the context. It's similar to the English word \"one\" when used to replace a noun. The key thing to remember is that 「の」 in this context **cannot stand alone**; it must be modified by an adjective, verb phrase, or other relative clause to specify which \"one\" you're referring to. It functions as a nominalizer, effectively turning a modifying phrase into a noun equivalent.",

            "nuance": "The use of 「欲しいです」 indicates a desire. The scene specifies a child, and while 「の」 is generally gender/age neutral, the context of a child desiring a toy makes this a common and innocent expression. 「大きい{の}」 naturally refers to 'a big one' where the specific noun is clear from context."
