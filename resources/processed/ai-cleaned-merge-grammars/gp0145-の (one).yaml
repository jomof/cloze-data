        "part-of-speech": "pronoun",
        "function": "Acts as a dependent indefinite pronoun, replacing a noun or clause to avoid redundancy or refer to an understood entity.",
        "nuance": "The key characteristic is that it cannot stand alone; it always requires a modifier (adjective, verb clause, etc.) to specify which \"one\" is being referred to.",

    "etymology": "The pronoun 「の」 is derived from the possessive particle 「の」, but in this context, it functions as a substitute for a previously mentioned or contextually understood noun. It indicates something that has already been established or is implied by both the speaker and the listener, allowing for concise and natural expression.",
    "writeup": "The pronoun 「の」 serves as a substitute for a noun that is already understood from the context or has been previously mentioned. It is comparable to the English word \"one\" when it is used to replace a noun. A crucial point to remember is that 「の」, in this usage, **cannot stand alone**; it must always be modified by an adjective, a verb phrase, or another type of relative clause to clarify precisely which \"one\" is being referred to. It functions as a nominalizer, effectively converting a modifying phrase into an equivalent noun.",
