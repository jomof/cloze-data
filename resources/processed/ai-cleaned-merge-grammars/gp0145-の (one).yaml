It is comparable to the English word \"one\" when it is used to replace a noun. A crucial point to remember is that 「の」, in this usage, **cannot stand alone**; it must always be modified by an adjective, a verb phrase, or another type of relative clause to clarify precisely which \"one\" is being referred to.
