    "etymology": "The word 「まだ」 originates from the classical Japanese word 「未だ」, which literally means \"not yet reached.\" It carries the nuance of incompleteness or continuation from a past state into the present.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「まだ」 is commonly translated as \"still\" or \"not yet,\" depending on the context. It expresses that something is unexpectedly continuing or has not yet finished. When used in a positive sentence, 「まだ」 signifies that something is unexpectedly still happening, similar to \"still\" in English. In a negative sentence, it indicates that something is unexpectedly not yet finished, similar to \"not yet\" in English. 「まだ」 can also be used in questions to confirm if something is still ongoing.",
