    "etymology": "The word 「まだ」 originates from the classical Japanese word 「未だ」 (imada), which literally means \"not yet reached.\" It carries the nuance of incompleteness or continuation from a past state into the present. This etymology reveals its fundamental meaning of something being in a state of continuation or uncompletion, which underpins both its 'still' and 'not yet' uses.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「まだ」 is a versatile word in Japanese, primarily conveying the idea of continuation, persistence, or uncompletion. It is commonly translated as \"still\" or \"not yet,\" depending on the context and the grammatical form of the verb it accompanies. \n\nWhen 「まだ」 is used with affirmative sentences, it indicates that something is **still** ongoing or in a particular state, often implying that this continuation is somewhat unexpected or noteworthy. For instance, if you expected something to be finished but it is not, 「まだ」 highlights its persistence.\n\nConversely, when 「まだ」 is paired with negative verb forms (especially the -ない form or -ていません), it signifies that something has **not yet** happened or is not yet complete. This usage also carries a nuance of uncompletion relative to an expectation or a set timeline.\n\n「まだ」 can also be used in questions to inquire about the continuation of a state or action. The speaker might be confirming an ongoing situation or asking if something has started/finished as expected.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Unexpectedness**: A key nuance of 「まだ」 is that the state or action it modifies is continuing (or not yet occurring) in a way that might be contrary to expectation. \n*   **Emphasis (まだまだ)**: Repeating 「まだ」 as 「まだまだ」 adds emphasis, suggesting that there is *still* a significant amount of continuation or a considerable way to go before completion. This often carries a humble or slightly exasperated tone.",
