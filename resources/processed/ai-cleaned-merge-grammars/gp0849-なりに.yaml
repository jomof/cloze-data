        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "Used to express that someone or something is doing something or existing in a manner appropriate to its own nature, circumstances, or limitations. It often implies making the best effort possible within those confines.",
        "function": "Expresses a manner, state, or quality characteristic of the preceding noun. It highlights that an action or attribute is particular to the subject, often acknowledging limitations but emphasizing authenticity or appropriateness to its state.",
        "nuance": "Often conveys a sense of \"doing one's best\" or \"being characteristic of\" a particular entity, even if the result isn't ideal or perfect. It acknowledges inherent limitations but highlights the genuineness or suitability of the effort or quality to one's specific condition. It can imply a kind of 'inherent' or 'natural' way of being or acting.",
        "colocation": "Frequently follows nouns describing roles (e.g., 子供, 学生, プロ), qualities (e.g., 下手, 広い), or pronouns (e.g., 自分, 私, それ). The particle に is used when modifying a verb or expressing manner adverbially; の is used when modifying a noun, indicating a characteristic quality.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions adverbially when followed by に, modifying verbs or adjectives. Functions attributively when followed by の, modifying nouns."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なりに」 comes from 「形 (かたち)」 meaning \"shape\" or \"form.\" It implies acting in accordance with one's own inherent shape or form, doing things in a way that is natural or appropriate to oneself. In its modern usage, 「なり」 itself acts as a kind of neologism, extending beyond a literal 'shape' to signify a 'characteristic' or 'appropriate' manner.",
    "writeup": "「なりに」 indicates that someone or something is doing something in their own way, or to the best of their ability, considering their circumstances. It often carries a nuance of acknowledging limitations while still trying to make the most of a situation. It can be translated as \"in one's own way,\" \"to the best of one's ability,\" or \"as much as one can.\"\n\nThis expression fundamentally derives from the concept of `形 (かたち)`, meaning \"shape\" or \"form.\" Thus, 「なりに」 implies acting or existing \"in the pattern of\" or \"in a manner inherent to\" something.\n\nIt often illustrates a scenario where **(A)**, a specific individual or entity, performs an action **(C)**, doing so in a way that is **(B)**, characteristic or appropriate to its own nature or condition.\n\nCrucially, 「なりに」 frequently conveys that while **(A)** may not be achieving perfection or an ideal standard, they are doing their utmost given the inherent `shape` or limitations of **(B)**. It emphasizes that the effort or quality, though perhaps not flawless, is the best that can be expected under the specific circumstances. In this particular grammatical usage, 「なり」 functions as a *neologism*, an established word adopted with a new, nuanced meaning to convey this precise sense of 'in one's own characteristic way'.\n\nThe particle following 「なり」 will be either `に` when modifying a verb or adverbially expressing the manner, or `の` when modifying a noun, signifying a characteristic quality (`なりの [Noun]`). It can follow most words in their plain form, where the preceding word defines the inherent nature or condition.",
