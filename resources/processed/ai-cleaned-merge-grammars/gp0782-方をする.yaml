    "etymology": "「方 (kata)」 means \"way\" or \"manner.\" 「する (suru)」 means \"to do.\" Thus, 「方をする」 literally means \"to do the way/manner,\" implying performing an action in a particular style or method. The particle 「を(o)」 is a direct object marker for 「する」.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「方をする」 is used to express that someone does something in a certain manner or way. It emphasizes the style or method in which an action is performed. The phrase is versatile and can be used with various adjectives, nouns, and verbs to provide specific details about the manner of the action.\n\nThere are three primary patterns:\n\n*   Adjective/Verb (informal) + の + Verb[ます stem] + 方をする: Describes doing something in a specific manner related to the adjective or verb. For example, 「ひどい負け方をする」 (to lose in a terrible way).\n*   Noun + のような + の + Verb[ます stem] + 方をする: Describes doing something in a manner resembling the noun. For example, 「子供のようなものの言い方をする」 (to talk like a child).\n*   Verb (informal) + ような + の + Verb[ます stem] + 方をする: Describes doing something in a way that evokes a certain feeling or result. For example, 「人が感動するような話し方をする」 (to speak in such a way that people are impressed).\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Adjectives rarely occur directly before 「ような」.\n*   The choice of adjective, noun, or verb will heavily influence the nuance of the sentence.",
