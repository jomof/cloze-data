pronunciation:
  katakana: ドウニモコウニモ〜ナイ
  romaji: Dounimo kounimo~nai
formation:
  どうにもこうにも + Verb[ない form]: Emphasizes the absolute impossibility of performing an action or changing
    a situation, despite all efforts or attempts.
jlpt: N1
etymology: The expression `どうにもこうにも` is formed from `どうにも` (dō nimo), meaning 'in any way, no matter how,'
  which itself comes from `どう` (dō, how) + `に` (ni, to) + `も` (mo, even/also). The repetition with `こうにも`
  (kō nimo, even this way) reinforces the idea of trying 'this way, that way, and every possible way.'
  When combined with a negative verb, it conveys that despite trying every conceivable method, there is
  'absolutely no way' to achieve the desired outcome or change a situation.
writeup: |-
  The phrase `どうにもこうにも〜ない` is used to express a strong sense of powerlessness or utter inability to do something, despite having tried everything or explored all options. It literally means 'no matter how, no matter this way or that way, it cannot be done.' This expression conveys a feeling of **frustration, resignation, or helplessness** due to the impossibility of a situation.

  It is often used when a problem is **insurmountable**, a task is **impossible to complete**, or a person feels **completely overwhelmed** by circumstances. It emphasizes that *all* efforts have failed, or that the situation is entirely beyond one's control.

  While generally used in **casual conversation**, the emotional weight of the phrase can make it feel quite serious depending on the context. It's not typically found in formal or business Japanese.

  - term: どうにもならない
    meaning: cannot be helped, is beyond one's control
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While similar, `どうにもならない` emphasizes a situation that has become unmanageable or has reached
      a point where no solution is possible, focusing more on the state of affairs itself. `どうにもこうにも〜ない`
      explicitly implies repeated, futile efforts to *do* something.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どうにもならない (cannot be helped)
  - term: どうしようもない
    meaning: cannot be helped, hopeless, nothing can be done
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expression conveys a stronger sense of hopelessness or resignation, indicating a complete
      lack of options or a truly dire situation. `どうにもこうにも〜ない` specifically highlights the *active inability*
      to perform an action despite trying, whereas `どうしようもない` is more about the overall lack of remedies
      for a situation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どうしようもない (cannot be helped・hopeless)
  - term: 〜ようがない・ようもない
    meaning: there is no way to, impossible to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This structure indicates that a particular action or method is nonexistent or cannot be performed
      due to external circumstances or lack of means. It is more objective and lacks the emotional weight
      of frustration and exhaustive personal effort implied by `どうにもこうにも〜ない`.
    grammar_point: ようがない・ようもない (no way to)
  - term: まったく〜ない
    meaning: not at all, completely not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a general intensifier for negation, simply stating that something is entirely absent
      or not happening. It does not carry the specific nuance of repeated futile effort or the sense of
      helplessness that `どうにもこうにも〜ない` conveys.
    grammar_point: 全く〜ない (not at all)
post_false_friends_writeup: The core distinction lies in the level of personal effort and frustration
  implied. `どうにもこうにも〜ない` carries a strong emotional overtone of having tried everything and still failing.
  Expressions like `どうにもならない` and `どうしようもない` describe a state of being beyond help, often without implying
  the same exhaustive personal struggle. `〜ようがない` indicates a lack of means or method, while `全く〜ない` is
  simply a strong negation without the nuance of struggle.

        english: My computer is too old, I cannot upgrade it.

          - 彼 は 頑固 だ から、説得 {する の は 無理 だ} よ。
        english: He's stubborn, so persuading him is impossible.
        hint: We want to emphasize that *despite all attempts*, it's impossible. The expression should
          show the futility of effort.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a difficult person at work.
    register: casual
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of `どうにもこうにも` here highlights the speaker's repeated failed attempts to persuade the
      stubborn person. The phrase `説得できない` (set-toku dekinai) confirms the impossibility, emphasizing
      the frustration. This reflects a common frustration felt by female colleagues when dealing with
      rigid male counterparts who refuse to listen.

        english: The baby won't stop crying, there's nothing that can be done.
        hint: While `どうしようもない` conveys hopelessness, `どうにもこうにも手が出ない` specifically means you've tried everything
          you can think of and still can't do anything.
    scene: A new parent is exhausted and overwhelmed by their crying baby.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The phrase `手が出ない` (te ga denai) means to be unable to deal with something or to be helpless.
      Combined with `どうにもこうにも`, it strongly expresses the parent's utter inability to soothe the baby
      despite all efforts. This emotional exhaustion can be felt universally, not specific to gender,
      but here used by a male speaker reflecting personal frustration.

        hint: We want to convey that despite trying various methods (like different medicines), the fever
          persists, indicating a difficult-to-resolve situation. `全く` is just a strong 'not at all'.

      kurenai) conveys his personal pain and the feeling of being rejected, underscoring the strong emotional
      impact of the situation.
