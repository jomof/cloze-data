    "writeup": "「かねる」, typically written in kana, attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. It indicates that it is **difficult, impossible, or one is hesitant to do something**, often due to external circumstances or conflicting desires. While 「できない」 also means \"cannot\", 「かねる」 is more formal and implies a sense of regret or reluctance. It suggests that performing the action would be \"a stretch\" of one's ability or capacity.

While other phrases may express inability or impossibility, 「かねる」 subtly suggests a desire or willingness that is overridden by circumstance. The important thing to remember about 「かねる」 is that it expresses reluctance, and that it is a formal construction. Pay attention to the surrounding context to understand the underlying reasons behind the inability and the degree of formality required.",
