    "etymology": "The verb 「兼 (か)ねる」 means \"to combine,\" \"to do two things at once,\" or \"to serve two purposes.\" When used as a suffix, it implies that doing something is difficult because it interferes with another obligation or conflicts with one's desires.",
    "writeup": "「かねる」, usually written in kana, attaches to the ます-stem of a verb and indicates that it is **difficult, impossible, or one is hesitant to do something**, often due to external circumstances or conflicting desires. Though 「できない」 can also mean \"cannot\", 「かねる」 is more formal and implies a sense of regret or reluctance. 「かねる」 is similar to saying something would be \"a stretch\" in English.",
