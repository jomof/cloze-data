  usage-context: General
  grammatical-role: adjective
etymology: 考えられない is the potential negative form of the verb 考える (kangaeru), meaning "to think" or "to
  consider." The potential form 考えられる (kangaerareru) means "can think" or "is conceivable." By adding
  the negative ない (nai), it becomes 考えられない (kangaerarenai), meaning "cannot think" or "is inconceivable."
  The core idea revolves around the inability to intellectually grasp or accept a certain reality.
writeup: |-
  考えられない is the negative potential form of the verb **考える** ('kangaeru', to consider). It is often used with adverbs like **など** (nado, like, such as) or expressions that nominalize a phrase, such as **ということは** (to iu koto wa, the fact that) or **なんて** (nante, such a thing as). **考えられない** is generally translated as "(A) is unimaginable" or "(A) is unthinkable," which is close to its literal meaning. This grammar point implies an inability to conceive of something due to its unbelievability, impossibility, or its being completely outside one's expectations or moral framework.

  **Important Consideration:**

  *   While **考えられない** refers to the inability to think of something, **考えない** (kangaenai, to not consider) or **考えていない** (kangaeteinai, to not be considering) express a conscious decision or current state of not thinking about something. Because of this, only **考えられない** is appropriate to imply something is unbelievable or inconceivable.
false_friends:
  - term: 考えない
    meaning: to not think, to not consider
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 考えられない, 考えない implies a conscious choice or decision to not think about something. It's
      about volition, not capability.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:考える (to think)
  - term: 考えたくない
    meaning: I don't want to think about it.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both are negative, 考えたくない expresses a desire not to think about something, whereas 考えられない
      expresses an inherent inability to imagine it. The former is about personal will, the latter about
      objective inconceivability.
    grammar_point: たい (want to do)
post_false_friends_writeup: It's important to differentiate **考えられない** from similar expressions. While
  **考えない** indicates a choice not to think about something, and **考えたくない** expresses a desire not to think
  about something, **考えられない** describes an inherent inability to conceive of something, often because
  it's unbelievable or outside the realm of possibility. Understanding this distinction is key to using
  each expression appropriately.

    conjugation: conditional (～たら)

      the impossibility of maintaining a certain perception or understanding.

        english: I can't believe such a ridiculous rumor is true.
        hint: This expresses a lack of belief due to credibility. We're looking for a phrase that means
          something is beyond comprehension or logical possibility.
    scene: Two friends are chatting casually about an absurd piece of gossip, finding it utterly impossible
      to accept as fact.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「なんて」 after 「そんな 馬鹿げた 噂 が 本当 だ」 strongly emphasizes the speaker's disbelief and
      rejection of the rumor as absurd. The phrase 「考えられない」 here implies that the idea is so illogical
      it cannot even be processed or conceived as real, reflecting a common male way of dismissing nonsense.
post_example_writeup: The variety of conjugations and contexts illustrates the flexibility of **考えられない**.
  It can express personal incredulity, comment on societal norms, or describe events that defy expectation.
  Pay close attention to the particles used, such as **なんて** and **とは**, as they often precede **考えられない**
  to emphasize the unexpected or inconceivable nature of the preceding clause. Understanding the subtle
  differences between this grammar point and other expressions of disbelief or negative opinion is crucial
  for natural usage.
