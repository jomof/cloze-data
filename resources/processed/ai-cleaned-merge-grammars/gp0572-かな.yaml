    "etymology": "「かな」 is derived from a combination of the sentence-ending particles 「か」 (used to pose questions) and 「な」 (used to express personal thoughts or opinions). Over time, these particles merged to form 「かな」, a single particle indicating the speaker is questioning their own thoughts or expressing a sense of wonder.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「かな」 is used at the end of a sentence to express a question or doubt to oneself, similar to \"I wonder...\" in English. It is used when the speaker is pondering something and seeking confirmation or expressing uncertainty. While it was once considered more feminine, 「かな」 is now used by both men and women equally in modern Japanese.",
