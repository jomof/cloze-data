etymology: 'The suffix 「がる」 is believed to have originated from the combination of the particle 「が」 (subject
  marker for emotions/desires) and the verb 「ある」 (to exist, present). Specifically, it likely evolved
  from phrases like 「気が有る (ki ga aru)」 or 「思いが有る (omoi ga aru)」, meaning "to have a certain feeling or
  thought." Over time, this 「が + ある」 became grammaticized and shortened to 「がる」 when attached to adjectives,
  serving to denote the outward manifestation of an internal state that the speaker observes in someone
  else. This etymology highlights why 「がる」 is used for third-person observation: you are describing the
  "existence" or "presence" of a feeling as it appears to you.'
writeup: 'The suffix 「〜がる」 is a fascinating grammatical tool in Japanese that allows you to describe someone
  else''s emotions or desires based on their outward behavior or appearance. It attaches to the stem of
  い-adjectives and directly to な-adjectives, transforming them into verbs that express the manifestation
  of a feeling.The core concept behind 「〜がる」 is observation. You use it when you are interpreting someone''s
  internal state from what you can see or hear. For instance, if you see a child crying and looking upset,
  you might say 「その子は悲しがっている」 (That child is acting sad/showing signs of sadness). You are not directly
  stating their internal sadness, but rather describing their sad behavior.It is absolutely crucial to
  remember that 「〜がる」 cannot be used to describe your own feelings. You know your own emotions directly;
  you don''t observe them from the outside. So, you would say 「私は嬉しい」 (I am happy), not 「私は嬉しがる」. This
  is a fundamental distinction from simply stating an emotion.The nuance of 「〜がる」 can sometimes imply
  a certain level of indirectness or even a slight negative connotation, especially if the person is overtly
  or annoyingly showing their feelings. However, it is most often used neutrally to simply report an observed
  behavior.Common examples include: い-adjectives: 「嬉しい」 (happy) → 「嬉しがる」 (to act happy), 「悲しい」 (sad) →
  「悲しがる」 (to act sad), 「暑い」 (hot) → 「暑がる」 (to act like one is hot/complain about heat), 「寒い」 (cold) →
  「寒がる」 (to act like one is cold/complain about cold). な-adjectives: 「嫌い」 (dislike) → 「嫌いがる」 (to show
  dislike), 「不思議」 (strange/curious) → 「不思議がる」 (to act surprised/curious). Desiderative form 「〜たい」: 「行きたい」
  (want to go) → 「行きたがる」 (to show signs of wanting to go).'

  - term: 〜そう (it seems・looks like)
    meaning: It seems/looks like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜そう」 expresses a direct observation about an external appearance or a prediction based on
      observable facts, applicable to anything (weather, food, person's state). 「〜がる」 specifically expresses
      an outward manifestation of an internal emotion or desire that is attributed to a person. You can
      say 「美味しそう」 (looks delicious) but not 「美味しがる」. You can say 「悲しそう」 (looks sad) or 「悲しがる」 (acts sad).
      「悲しそう」 is a direct observation of their appearance, while 「悲しがる」 implies they are actively showing
      their sadness (e.g., crying, complaining). The key difference is that 「〜そう」 focuses on how something
      looks, while 「〜がる」 focuses on how a person acts out their feelings.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[そう] (appearance)
  - term: 〜げ (seeming・appearance)
    meaning: Seeming, appearance
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜げ」 is a noun suffix that describes the manner or atmosphere of someone's state or appearance,
      often associated with abstract or internal states. For example, 「悲しげ」 describes a "sad look" or
      "sad manner." Unlike 「〜がる」, which is a verb describing an action or behavior, 「〜げ」 is a more static
      description. You can say 「悲しげな顔」 (a sad-looking face), but 「悲しがる」 implies active behavior like crying.
      「〜げ」 describes a static appearance; 「〜がる」 describes a dynamic act.
    grammar_point: げ (seeming・appearance)
  - term: 〜っぽい (ish; characteristic of)
    meaning: ish; characteristic of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜っぽい」 indicates that something has the characteristics of something else, or a tendency towards
      a certain state. For instance, 「子供っぽい」 means "childish" (having the characteristics of a child),
      and 「怒りっぽい」 means "easily angered" (having a tendency to get angry). This expression describes a
      general characteristic or inclination, not a current, observable display of emotion as 「〜がる」 does.
      It's about an inherent trait rather than a real-time manifestation of a feeling.
    grammar_point: っぽい (ish; characteristic of)
  - term: 悲しい
    meaning: sad
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「悲しい」 states the speaker's own sadness or describes someone else's sadness directly if known.
      「悲しがる」 states that someone appears or acts sad based on observation. The key difference is direct
      knowledge vs. observation.
    grammar_point: い-Adjectives (adjectives ending in い)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate these closely related expressions, remember 「〜がる」 specifically
  highlights the active, observable behavior that someone exhibits due to an internal feeling or desire.
  If you are describing how something looks in general, 「〜そう」 is more appropriate. If you are describing
  a person's general manner or aura of a feeling, 「〜げ」 is often used. And if you are describing a characteristic
  tendency or likeness, 「〜っぽい」 is the right choice. 「〜がる」 implies an observed action, whereas the others
  describe a state, appearance, or characteristic.
