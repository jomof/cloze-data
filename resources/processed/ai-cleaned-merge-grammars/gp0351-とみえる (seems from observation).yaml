formation:
  '[Clause] + とみえる': Expresses a deduction or conclusion based on available information; 'it seems that,'
    'it appears that.'
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Generally applicable in contexts where a speaker makes a deduction based on observable
    facts or available information.
  function: To express a deduction or conclusion about a situation or state based on visual cues or other
    evidence.
  nuance: Implies a reasoned judgment and a relatively confident conclusion, as opposed to a mere impression
    or hearsay.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a sentence-final expression or a clause-connecting element, asserting
    a conclusion.
  logical-flow: Connects an observed fact or premise to a logical conclusion derived from it
etymology: 「とみえる」 combines the particle 「と」, indicating a conclusion or result, with the verb 「見える(みえる)」,
  meaning "to appear" or "to be visible". Essentially, it conveys the idea that something appears to be
  a certain way, leading to a particular conclusion.
writeup: |-
  「とみえる」 (typically written in hiragana) is a grammatical construction combining the particle と, which marks a conclusion or quotation, with the verb 見える (みえる), meaning 'to appear' or 'to be visible.' Literally, it conveys 'from what is visible/appears, one can conclude that...' However, it is best understood as expressing a reasoned deduction or conclusion based on observable evidence or available information. It translates to 'it seems that,' 'it appears that,' or 'one can conclude that.'

  This expression is always appended directly after the clause that forms the basis of the deduction. When the preceding clause ends with a noun or a な-adjective, it requires だ before とみえる. For example, 「学生だ とみえる」(it seems to be a student) or 「静かだ とみえる」(it seems to be quiet).

  While とみえる indicates conjecture, it carries a degree of confidence, implying that the speaker has specific reasons or evidence that led them to this conclusion. It is not a mere guess, but a logical inference drawn from what is perceived. It is generally applicable across registers, though the politeness level of 見える can be adjusted (e.g., とみえます for polite forms).

  The particle と, in this context, functions to "sum up" the preceding clause as a direct conclusion. This is similar to how と marks a quotation (summing up what was said or thought) or accompanies things that are 'together' (summing up a group of items or people).
false_friends:
  - term: ようだ
    meaning: it seems that, it appears that, it looks like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようだ」 expresses a general impression or conjecture, often with less direct evidence or a lower
      degree of certainty than 「とみえる」. It can also imply a similarity or resemblance.
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
  - term: らしい
    meaning: seems like, apparently, I heard
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「らしい」 conveys information based on hearsay, rumors, or what is generally characteristic of
      something, implying an indirect source or common understanding, rather than a direct, evidence-based
      deduction like 「とみえる」.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
  - term: に見える
    meaning: to look, to seem, to appear
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に見える」 describes how something visually appears or strikes one's eye, focusing on perception
      or a subjective impression. In contrast, 「とみえる」 is used for a reasoned conclusion or deduction based
      on observable facts or available information.
    grammar_point: にみえる (to look like)
  - term: そう
    meaning: looks like, appears, seems
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そう」 indicates an immediate impression or appearance based on sensory perception, often directly
      attached to a verb or adjective stem. Unlike 「とみえる」, it doesn't necessarily imply a reasoned deduction
      from evidence, but rather how something outwardly presents itself.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]・[い-Adjective-stem]・[な-Adjective]そうだ (it seems・looks like)'
post_false_friends_writeup: The key to differentiating 「とみえる」 from similar expressions lies in its implication
  of a reasoned deduction. Unlike 「ようだ」 or 「らしい」, which can convey a sense of uncertainty, indirect information,
  or characteristic behavior, 「とみえる」 suggests that the speaker has considered available information and
  arrived at a relatively confident conclusion based on observable evidence. 「に見える」, on the other hand,
  focuses on visual appearance, describing how something looks rather than a logical inference about its
  state or cause. Lastly, 「そう」 expresses an an immediate sensory impression, lacking the deeper deductive
  process of 「とみえる」.
examples:
  - english: She is always smiling, so it seems she has no worries.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は いつ も 笑顔 だ から、悩み が ない {と みえる}。
      - いつ も 笑顔 だ から、彼女 は 悩み なんて ない {と みえる}。
      - 彼女 は いつ も 笑顔 だ ね。悩み は ない {と みえる}。
    english_literally: Because she is always smiling, it appears she has no worries.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は いつ も 笑顔 だ から、悩み が ない {よう だ}。
        english: Because she is always smiling, it seems she has no worries (general impression).
        hint: 「ようだ」 implies a more general impression or conjecture, often with less direct evidence or
          a lower degree of certainty than とみえる. We're looking for a reasoned conclusion based on direct
          observation.
    scene: Observing a friend's consistently cheerful demeanor.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The use of とみえる here implies a deduction based on the repeated observation of her always smiling,
      leading to the conclusion that she likely has no worries. This is a reasoned inference, not a mere
      guess.
    etymology: The formation combines the casual observation of the friend's state (いつも笑顔だ) with とみえる
      to form a conclusive statement about their inner state, reflecting the logical flow inherent in
      the grammar point's structure.
  - english: The customer seems to be in a hurry. Let's hurry so we don't keep them waiting.
    japanese:
      - お 客 様 は 急い で いる {と みえ ます}。お 待た せ し ない よう に、急ぎ ましょう。
      - お 客 様 が 急い で いらっしゃる {と みえ ます}。お 待た せ し ない よう、急ぎ ましょう。
      - 急い で いらっしゃる お 客 様 {と みえ ます}。早急 に ご 対応 し ましょう。
    english_literally: The customer appears to be hurrying. So that we do not make them wait, let's hurry.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 客 様 は 急い で いる {よう です}。お 待た せ し ない よう に、急ぎ ましょう。
        english: The customer seems to be in a hurry (general impression). Let's hurry so we don't keep
          them waiting.
        hint: 「ようです」 implies a general impression or conjecture. 「とみえます」 indicates a more direct deduction
          based on observable behavior. We're looking for a clear deduction based on observation.
    scene: A store clerk noticing a customer's actions and inferring their state.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: In a professional setting, the clerk uses the polite とみえます to convey a respectful observation
      and a confident deduction about the customer's state, which then leads to a necessary course of
      action. This shows keen observation and proactive service.
    etymology: The polite form とみえます enhances the professional context, signifying a respectful but firm
      deduction based on the customer's actions (急いでいる). The instruction to hurry (急ぎましょう) directly follows
      from this observation.
  - english: He didn't come to yesterday's party, so it seemed he was busy.
    japanese:
      - 昨日 の パーティー に は 来 なかっ た から、彼 は 忙しかっ た {と みえ た}。
      - 昨日 の パーティー、彼 来 なかっ た でしょ。忙しかっ た {と みえ た} よ。
      - 彼、昨日 の パーティー 来 なかっ た から、忙しかっ た {と みえ た} ん だ ね。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 の パーティー に は 来 なかっ た から、彼 は 忙しかっ た {らしい}。
        english: Because he didn't come to yesterday's party, apparently he was busy (hearsay/characteristic).
        hint: 「らしい」 suggests the information is based on hearsay or what is characteristic. 「とみえた」 implies
          a deduction made from direct evidence. We're looking for a deduction based on a factual event.
    scene: Friends discussing why someone was absent from an event.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The past tense とみえた indicates a deduction made about a past event, specifically his absence
      from the party. The casual tone suits a conversation among friends, and the deduction feels grounded
      in the specific past fact.
    etymology: The use of the past tense とみえた reflects a past deduction. The causative particle から (because)
      connects the factual absence from the party to the logical conclusion of him being busy.
  - english: The lights in the room are off. It seems no one has returned home yet.
    japanese:
      - 部屋 の 電気 が 消え て いる。まだ 誰 も 帰宅 し て い ない {と みえる}。

        english: The room's lights are off. It seems no one has returned home yet (general impression).
        hint: 「ようだ」 expresses a general impression. 「とみえる」 indicates a deduction based on concrete evidence.
          We're looking for a direct inference from an observable fact.
    scene: Arriving home and finding the house dark.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: This casual expression indicates a straightforward deduction based on direct visual evidence
      (the lights being off), leading to a confident conclusion about the house's occupancy.
    etymology: The direct observation 「部屋の電気が消えている」 immediately leads to the deduction using とみえる. This
      sentence structure demonstrates the point's function in forming conclusions from observable facts.
  - english: That team's practice is very intense. It seems they have a strong will to win.
    japanese:
      - あの チーム の 練習 は とても 厳しい。勝利 へ の 強い 意志 が ある {と みえる}。

        english: That team's practice is very intense. It seems they have a strong will to win (general
          impression).
        hint: 「ようだ」 gives a general impression. 「とみえる」 implies a more concrete deduction based on strong
          evidence. We're looking for a reasoned conclusion from observation.
    scene: A coach observing a rival team's training session.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: Used by a coach, this semi-formal phrasing implies an informed, professional deduction based
      on observing intense training, suggesting a deep understanding of the effort required for success.
    etymology: The observation of rigorous practice (練習はとても厳しい) directly supports the inference of a strong
      will to win (強い意志がある), illustrating とみえる's role in connecting evidence to logical conclusions.
  - english: A huge shadow is visible in the sky. It appears to be a UFO.
    japanese:
      - 空 に 巨大 な 影 が 見える。あれ は UFO {と みえる}。
      - 空 に 巨大 な 影 が 見える よ。あれ は UFO {と みえる} ね。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 空 に 巨大 な 影 が 見える。あれ は UFO {に 見える}。
        english: A huge shadow is visible in the sky. That looks like a UFO (visual appearance).
        hint: 「に見える」 describes how something visually appears or strikes one's eye. 「とみえる」 is used for
          a reasoned conclusion or deduction based on observable facts. We're looking for a deduction
          about what something *is*.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 空 に 巨大 な 影 が 見える。あれ は UFO {そう だ}。
        english: A huge shadow is visible in the sky. That looks like a UFO (immediate impression).
        hint: 「そう」 describes an immediate appearance based on sensory perception. 「とみえる」 implies a more
          reasoned deduction from observable facts. We're looking for a conclusion drawn from the visual
          evidence.
    scene: Someone spotting an unusual object in the sky and making an immediate deduction.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The excited tone emphasizes an immediate deduction based on a striking visual, even if the
      conclusion is speculative. It shows how とみえる can express a direct inference from perception.
    etymology: The visual input 「巨大な影が見える」 directly triggers the deduction about the object's identity,
      using とみえる to express this immediate logical leap based on appearance.
  - english: She's been silent and looking down. It seems she has something to worry about, so it's hard
      to talk to her.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は ずっと 黙っ て 下 を 向い て いる。何 か 心配 事 が ある {と みえ て}、話しかけ にくい。
      - 彼女、黙っ て 下 を 向い てる なあ。心配 事 が ある {と みえ て}、話しかけ づらい な。
      - ずっと 下 を 向い て 黙っ てる よ。何 か 悩み が ある {と みえ て}、声 かけ づらい な。
    english_literally: She is continuously silent and looking down. Appearing to have some worries, it
      is difficult to talk to her.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は ずっと 黙っ て 下 を 向い て いる。何 か 心配 事 が ある {よう で}、話しかけ にくい。
        english: She's been silent and looking down. It seems she has something to worry about (general
          impression), so it's hard to talk to her.
        hint: The te-form of 「ようだ」 implies a general impression acting as a cause. 「とみえて」 indicates a
          more direct deduction based on observable behavior that causes the subsequent difficulty. We're
          looking for a causal relationship based on a clear inference.
    scene: Observing a friend's unusual quietness and inferring their emotional state.
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The male speaker's observation of her silent and downtrodden posture, expressed with 「ずっと黙って下を向いている」,
      leads to the deduction 「心配事がある とみえて」. The use of the te-form とみえて implies that this observation
      and deduction are the cause of the subsequent difficulty in approaching her, conveying a subtle,
      sympathetic understanding. While 「とみえて」 is gender-neutral, the overall sentence structure and implied
      empathy are common in casual speech for an older male observing a younger female's distress.
    etymology: The te-form of とみえる here acts as a conjunctive, indicating that the deduction (her having
      worries) is the reason or cause for the speaker's subsequent action (finding it hard to talk to
      her). This shows its versatility in linking cause and effect based on observation.
  - english: He hasn't been eating much lately. It seems he's not feeling well.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 最近 あまり 食べ て い ない。体調 が 良く ない {と みえる}。
      - 最近、彼 あまり 食べ て ない ね。体調 が 良く ない {と みえる}。
      - 彼、この頃 食欲 ない ん だ。体調 が 悪い {と みえる} なあ。
    english_literally: He recently is not eating much. It appears his physical condition is not good.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 最近 あまり 食べ て い ない。体調 が 良く ない {よう だ}。
        english: He hasn't been eating much lately. It seems he's not feeling well (general impression).
        hint: 「ようだ」 implies a more general impression or conjecture. 「とみえる」 indicates a more direct deduction
          based on observable behavior. We're looking for a clear deduction from observation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 最近 あまり 食べ て い ない。体調 が 良く ない {そう だ}。
        english: He's yawning a lot. He looks unwell (immediate visual impression).
        hint: 「そう」 describes an immediate appearance based on sensory perception. 「とみえる」 implies a more
          reasoned deduction from observable facts. We're looking for a conclusion drawn from the change
          in eating habits.
    scene: A colleague observing another colleague's change in eating habits.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The speaker, a female, observes a colleague's lack of appetite 「最近あまり食べていない」 and makes a direct
      inference about his health 「体調が良くないとみえる」. This reflects a common compassionate observation often
      made in close-knit work or social environments.
    etymology: This example showcases a common use of とみえる to infer an internal state (体調が良くない) from external,
      observable behavior (あまり食べていない). It's a simple, direct application of the grammar point's deductive
      function.
  - english: The train was delayed for over an hour. It seemed there was an accident somewhere.
    japanese:
      - 電車 が 1 時間 以上 遅れ た。どこ か で 事故 が あっ た {と みえ た}。
      - 電車、1 時間 以上 遅れ た よ ね。どこ か で 事故 が あっ た {と みえ た} な。
      - 1 時間 も 電車 が 遅れ た から、どこ か で 事故 が あっ た {と みえ た} な。
    english_literally: The train was delayed over one hour. It appeared there was an accident somewhere.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 電車 が 1 時間 以上 遅れ た。どこ か で 事故 が あっ た {らしい}。
        english: The train was delayed for over an hour. Apparently, there was an accident somewhere (based
          on hearsay).
        hint: 「らしい」 suggests the information is based on hearsay or common knowledge. 「とみえた」 implies a
          direct deduction based on the observed fact of the delay itself. We're looking for a deduction
          from an observable past event.
    scene: Someone reflecting on a past train delay.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: This deduction, 「どこかで事故があったとみえた」, is made based on the concrete, observable fact of the train's
      extensive delay 「電車が1時間以上遅れた」. It highlights how とみえる is used to infer a cause from an an observed
      effect.
    etymology: The past tense とみえた is used to express a deduction about a past event, directly linking
      the observable effect (delay) to the inferred cause (accident). This demonstrates the logical inferential
      power of the grammar point.
  - english: He's yawning a lot. It seems he didn't get enough sleep last night.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は あくび ばかり し て いる。昨日 は あまり 眠れ なかっ た {と みえる}。
      - 彼、あくび ばかり し てる ね。昨日 は あまり 眠れ なかっ た {と みえる}。
      - あくび ばかり し て る よ。きっと 昨日 は 眠れ なかっ た {と みえる} な。
    english_literally: He is only yawning. It appears he could not sleep much yesterday.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は あくび ばかり し て いる。昨日 は あまり 眠れ なかっ た {よう だ}。
        english: He's yawning a lot. It seems he didn't get enough sleep last night (general impression).
        hint: 「ようだ」 implies a more general impression or conjecture, often with less direct evidence or
          a lower degree of certainty than とみえる. We're looking for a reasoned conclusion based on direct
          observation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は あくび ばかり し て いる。昨日 は あまり 眠れ なかっ た {そう だ}。
        english: He's yawning a lot. He looks like he didn't get enough sleep last night (immediate impression).
        hint: 「そう」 describes an immediate appearance based on sensory perception. 「とみえる」 implies a more
          reasoned deduction from observable facts. We're looking for a conclusion drawn from his yawning.
    scene: Two friends are observing another friend during a casual gathering.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The female speaker observes her male friend's repeated yawning 「あくびばかりしている」 and deduces that
      he didn't sleep much, expressing a common empathetic observation in a casual setting.
    etymology: This example highlights how とみえる is used to infer an internal state (lack of sleep) from
      an external, observable behavior (yawning). It's a simple, direct application of the grammar point's
      deductive function.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「とみえる」 is highly versatile. It consistently implies
  a conclusion drawn from observable evidence, distinguishing it from expressions that convey more general
  impressions or hearsay. Pay attention to the preceding clause, as it always provides the factual basis
  for the deduction, whether it's a state, an action, or a past event.
