    part-of-speech: phrase
    register: semi-formal
    function: Expresses naturalness or expectedness
    nuance: Strong expectation, sometimes implies "serves them right" or slight disapproval if negative.
    grammatical-role: predicate modifier
  etymology: The term 当然 (tōzen) combines 当 (tō, meaning 'to hit,' 'to be applicable,' 'to be proper') and
    然 (zen, a suffix indicating 'state' or 'manner,' often seen in words like 自然 shizen 'nature' or 偶然 gūzen
    'by chance'). Thus, 当然 literally means "to be in a proper/fitting state or manner." When combined with
    the て-form of a verb or adjective, it asserts that the action or state is exactly what 'fits' or 'should
    be' in a given situation, making it natural or expected. The て-form itself signifies a preceding action
    or state that leads to the following conclusion, reinforcing the idea that the natural outcome *results
    from* the preceding action/state.
  writeup: The grammar pattern 「〜て当然だ」 is used to express that a certain action, state, or outcome is **natural,
    obvious, or to be expected**. It conveys a strong sense that, given the circumstances, the conclusion
    is logical and unavoidable. It can be translated as "it's natural that...", "it's obvious that...",
    "of course...", or "it stands to reason that...". This expression implies that the speaker believes
    the situation is entirely reasonable and in line with common sense or prior information. It can be applied
    to both positive and negative outcomes. When used with a **negative outcome**, 「〜て当然だ」 can sometimes
    carry a nuance of **"serves them right"** or "it's no surprise that this bad thing happened because
    of X." This is important to note as it can sound critical or judgmental in certain contexts. **Formation:**
    * **Verb (て-form) + 当然だ** (e.g., 疲れて当然だ - it's natural to be tired) * **い-Adjective (くて-form) + 当然だ**
    (e.g., 忙しくて当然だ - it's natural to be busy) * **な-Adjective (で) + 当然だ** (e.g., 元気で当然だ - it's natural to
    be healthy) * **Noun (で) + 当然だ** (e.g., 学生で当然だ - it's natural to be a student) It can also be used in
    the form **「〜のは当然だ」** to nominalize the preceding clause, emphasizing the naturalness of the entire
    action or fact. For example, 「彼が怒るのは当然だ」 (It's natural for him to get angry). While 「〜て当然だ」 expresses
    strong certainty, it generally refers to what is **naturally inherent or logically follows** from a
    situation. It's often used in explanations or to justify an outcome.
  false_friends:
    - term: に決まっている (surely is)
      meaning: It is surely the case; It is bound to be; It is certainly true.
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: に決まっている expresses a strong conviction or certainty that something *must* be the case, often
        based on strong evidence or deduction, even if it's not universally "natural." 「〜て当然だ」 focuses on
        the inherent naturalness or logical expectation of an outcome.
      grammar_point: に決まっている (surely is)
    - term: はずだ (expected to be)
      meaning: Bound to be, Expected to be, Should be (able)
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: はずだ expresses an expectation based on information, plans, or general understanding, implying
        a high probability. While often natural, it can also be used for expectations that might not be
        universally "obvious" or "inherent." 「〜て当然だ」 emphasizes the inherent naturalness or logical inevitability.
      grammar_point: はずだ (expected to be)
    - term: ものだ (general truth expectation)
      meaning: Indicates something is natural, expected, or supposed to be a certain way.
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: ものだ states a general truth, common practice, or inherent characteristic. It describes what
        is generally *expected* or *supposed to be*, but it doesn't carry the same strong sense of a specific
        outcome being *obvious* or *unavoidable* given a particular situation, as 「〜て当然だ」 does. 「ものだ」 is
        more about universal tendencies; 「〜て当然だ」 is about specific, logical conclusions.
      grammar_point: ものだ (general truth expectation)
    - term: 〜に足る (worthy of)
      meaning: To be worthy of, To be enough, To be sufficient
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 〜に足る indicates that something is worthy of a certain action or consideration. While "worth"
        can sometimes align with "natural," it's about deservingness, not inherent obviousness or logical
        consequence. It is often used in formal or literary contexts.
      grammar_point: に足る (worthy of)
  post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「〜て当然だ」, 「に決まっている」, 「はずだ」, and 「ものだ」, consider the subtle
    differences in certainty and basis of expectation. 「〜て当然だ」 asserts that something is inherently logical
    or a natural consequence, leaving little room for doubt. 「に決まっている」 is about strong deduction and certainty,
    often from evidence. 「はずだ」 is about expectation based on information or plans. 「ものだ」 describes general
    truths or common characteristics. Use 「〜に足る」 when discussing deservingness or merit, not naturalness.
  examples:

          english: Since he practiced every day, he should become good.
          hint: 「はずだ」 expresses an expectation based on information or a plan. We're looking for a statement
            about inherent naturalness given the effort.

          english: Since you broke the promise, you should be angered (you deserve to be angered).
          hint: 「べきだ」 expresses an obligation or what *ought* to happen, often with a sense of moral judgment
            or recommendation. We're looking for a statement about an inherent, logical outcome, not what
            you deserve.
      scene: A friend comforting another who is upset after someone broke a promise.
      register: casual
      setting: sympathetic
      nuance: The passive form 「怒ら れて」 (to be angered) combined with 「当然だ」 highlights that being the recipient
        of anger is a natural, unavoidable consequence of breaking a promise.
    - english: After working this much, it's natural to be sleepy.

          english: Since he's a professional athlete, he's bound to run that fast.
          hint: 「に決まっている」 expresses a strong conviction or certainty based on evidence, but not necessarily
            inherent naturalness. We're looking for a statement about what's an inherent and obvious outcome.
      scene: Sports commentators discussing an athlete's performance.
      register: formal
      setting: informative
      nuance: The use of the potential form 「走れ て」 (can run) emphasizes that the ability itself is a natural
        outcome of being a professional athlete.

          english: If you become famous, privacy tends to disappear.

          english: Since they were so irresponsible, they're bound to fail.
          hint: 「に決まっている」 expresses a strong conviction that something *will* happen, often with a sense
            of inevitability due to strong evidence. We're looking for a statement about an inherent, logical
            outcome that might also imply they deserve it.
      scene: Someone expressing a critical view of another's misfortune.
      register: casual
      setting: technical
      speaker_gender: male
      nuance: The masculine casual tone implicit with 「あんなに 無責任 だった ん だから」 combined with 「当然だ」 leans into
        the "serves them right" or "no sympathy" feeling.

          english: Children tend to make noise. It's more unnatural for them to be quiet.

      scene: A parent explaining child behavior to someone without kids.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: female
      nuance: The use of 「子供たち」 (children) coupled with 「当然だ」 implies a common, universally accepted truth
        about their behavior. The follow-up sentence 「静か に して いる 方 が 不自然 だ」 (being quiet is more unnatural)
        further emphasizes this.
    - english: Since it's consecutive days of overtime, it's natural for him to be utterly exhausted.

            - 一生 懸命 勉強 し た ん だ から、良い 点 を 取る {べき だ}。
          english: Since you studied hard, you should get a good score.
          hint: 「べきだ」 expresses an obligation or strong recommendation for what *should* be done. We're
            looking for a statement about an inherent, expected outcome, not a moral obligation.
      scene: A teacher advising a student after an exam.
      register: formal
      setting: instructional
  post_example_writeup: Understanding the core meaning of 「当然だ」 as something that is logically or inherently
    expected will help you distinguish it from similar expressions. While 「はずだ」 and 「に決まっている」 express high
    probability or certainty, 「当然だ」 specifically emphasizes the naturalness or inevitability of the outcome
    given the situation. It's often used when an action or state is a direct and logical consequence of
    a preceding condition or widely accepted truth.

  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    register: casual
    usage-context: Used in general conversations and writing when asserting that a situation or outcome
      is completely expected or logical given the circumstances.
    function: To state something as an obvious, expected, or inevitable truth.
    nuance: Implies a strong sense of certainty and often a slight tone of 'it goes without saying' or 'why
      are you even questioning this?'. It can sometimes be used to dismiss an alternative possibility as
      absurd.
    grammatical-role: Functions as a predicate, completing a sentence or clause.
    logical-flow: Presents a conclusion as a logical and undeniable consequence of a preceding condition
      or reason.
    temporal-flow: Applies to present or past states/actions, asserting their naturalness or inevitability
      at the time of occurrence.
  etymology: 「当然 (とうぜん)」 literally means "of course" or "naturally." By attaching the て-form of a preceding
    word/phrase to 「当然だ」, it creates a construction where the action or state preceding 「て当然だ」 leads to
    a natural or logical consequence. The て-form here acts as a connecting particle indicating reason or
    cause, similar to its use in other grammatical patterns.
  writeup: |-
    The grammar point 「て当然だ」 (or 「て当然です」 in polite form) is used to express that something is **natural, obvious, or a matter of course**. It conveys a strong sense of expectation or inevitability regarding an outcome given a certain preceding condition or reason. The speaker uses this expression when they believe the outcome is fully justified or to be expected under the circumstances.

    This pattern attaches to the て-form of various word types:
    *   **Verbs**: For actions or states expressed by verbs (e.g., 疲れる → 疲れて当然だ 'it's natural to be tired').
    *   **い-Adjectives**: For states expressed by い-adjectives (e.g., 美味しい → 美味しくて当然だ 'it's natural for it to be delicious').
    *   **な-Adjectives**: For states expressed by な-adjectives, using the `な-adjective stem + で` (e.g., 綺麗だ → 綺麗で当然だ 'it's natural for it to be beautiful').
    *   **Nouns**: For states expressed by nouns, using `Noun + で` (e.g., 学生だ → 学生で当然だ 'it's natural to be a student').

    While the nuance is similar to '当たり前だ' (atarimae da), 「て当然だ」 often carries a stronger, more assertive tone, emphasizing the logical consequence or the undeniable nature of the situation. It is a direct and somewhat emphatic way of stating the obvious.
  false_friends:
    - term: のも当然だ
      meaning: It is only natural that; It is no wonder
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「のも当然だ」 often emphasizes the speaker's agreement or understanding of the situation, while
        「て当然だ」 simply states something is a matter of course without necessarily emphasizing agreement.
      grammar_point: のも当然だ (it is only natural)
    - term: のももっともだ
      meaning: May well, Have or has good reason for, No wonder, … Is only natural
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「のももっともだ」 suggests stronger justification or reason behind a situation compared to 「て当然だ」,
        implying a more reasoned basis for the naturalness.
      grammar_point: <suggest>:のももっともだ (it is only natural)
  post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「のも当然だ」 and 「のももっともだ」 are similar in meaning to 「て当然だ」, they carry
    subtly different nuances. 「のも当然だ」 often indicates agreement or understanding with a situation, whereas
    「のももっともだ」 implies a stronger justification or reason for why something is natural. Use 「て当然だ」 when you
    want to assert something as an undeniably natural or expected outcome, often with a direct and emphatic
    tone.
  examples:

    「当然じゃない」 are acceptable, with the latter often carrying a slightly more emphatic or conversational tone.
