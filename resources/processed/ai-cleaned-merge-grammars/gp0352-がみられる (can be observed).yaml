pronunciation:

  romaji: ga mirareru
formation:
  '[Noun] + が + 見られる': Indicates that something can be seen, observed, or is evident.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  usage-context: Used to describe phenomena, trends, or observations that are possible or evident under
    certain conditions, or to express ability to see something. It can be used in both plain and polite
    forms.
etymology: 見られる is the potential or passive form of the verb 見る (miru), meaning "to see" or "to look."
  The potential form indicates the possibility or ability to see something, while the passive form indicates
  that something is being seen or observed. The が particle marks the subject that is being seen or observed.
  This grammatical pattern evolved from the straightforward verb conjugations to convey a sense of objective
  observation or an inherent capacity for something to be seen, rather than an active act of seeing by
  a person.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「がみられる」 indicates that something can be seen, observed, or is evident. It is derived from the potential or passive form of the verb 「見る」 (miru, "to see"). Unlike 「見える」, which simply states that something *is* visible, 「がみられる」 emphasizes the ability or possibility to see something, often implying that some effort, specific conditions, or a certain perspective are required or have been met for the observation to occur.

  Because 「見られる」 is both the potential and passive form of 「見る」, it can be interpreted in either way, depending on the context. However, it's worth noting that in some colloquial uses, the 「ら」 sound is dropped in the potential form of some Godan verbs (known as *ra-nuki kotoba*), but 「見られる」 is an Ichidan verb and maintains its form.

  This grammar point is often used to describe natural phenomena, trends, or situations where something becomes apparent. It highlights the observable nature of the subject. The particle 「が」 marks the subject that can be seen or observed, emphasizing its role in the observation.
false_friends:
  - term: 見える (to be visible・to seem)
    meaning: To be visible, to seem, to be in sight
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「がみられる」, 「見える」 simply describes that something *is* visible, without implying any specific
      conditions or effort to see it. 「見える」 often refers to something within one's natural field of vision
      or an inherent state of visibility. It is a more passive statement of existence of vision.
    grammar_point: 見える (to be visible・to seem)
  - term: らしい (I hear, it seems)
    meaning: Indicates hearsay, conjecture, or something that seems to be the case based on available
      information.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「がみられる」 expresses something that *can be objectively observed or is evident*, 「らしい」
      conveys that something *seems to be the case* based on indirect information, common knowledge, or
      someone's impression. It's about an appearance or a general understanding, not direct physical observation.
    grammar_point: らしい (I hear, it seems)
  - term: ようだ (it seems)
    meaning: It seems that, It appears that, It looks like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようだ」 expresses a subjective conjecture or impression based on direct observation or intuition.
      It indicates something *looks* or *seems* like something. In contrast, 「がみられる」 implies a more objective
      fact that something *is observable* or *can be observed*, often related to data, trends, or physical
      phenomena.
    grammar_point: ようだ (it seems)
  - term: にみえる (to look like)
    meaning: To look, to seem, to appear
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜にみえる」 often describes how something *appears to someone's eyes* or *seems* in a subjective
      way, or how an object presents itself. While it involves visibility, it focuses on the *impression*
      or *perception*. 「がみられる」 is about the objective possibility or fact of something being observable.
    grammar_point: にみえる (to look like)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  To avoid mixing these expressions, remember that 「がみられる」 emphasizes that something *can be objectively observed* or *is evident*, often implying a specific condition or effort, or an objective observation of a phenomenon or trend. For instance, you might say a pattern or trend can be observed.

  In contrast, 「見える」 (mieru) simply describes that something *is visible* to the eye, focusing on its inherent state of visibility without implying special conditions or effort.

  When considering things that *seem* or *appear* to be the case:
  -   「らしい」 (rashii) conveys that something *seems true based on indirect information* or general understanding, rather than direct observation. It's about a common perception or hearsay.
  -   「ようだ」 (you da) indicates a *subjective impression or conjecture* derived from direct observation or intuition, often implying 'it looks like X' or 'it seems like Y'.
  -   「〜にみえる」 (ni mieru) focuses on how something *appears to someone's perception* or creates a certain impression, often in a more subjective or interpretive sense.

  While all these terms touch upon perception or appearance, 「がみられる」 stands out for its emphasis on the objective observability of a fact, trend, or phenomenon.

        english: Seeing the market changes, we decided to revise our strategy.
        hint: 「見て」 implies a conscious, active act of seeing by an agent. 「が 見られて」 implies that the changes
          became observable or evident, leading to the decision. We're looking for an expression that
          focuses on the changes becoming apparent rather than someone actively looking for them.
    scene: During a business strategy meeting, a team leader summarizes findings.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The Te-form 「見られて」 connects the observation to the subsequent action, implying that the changes
      became evident and *as a result*, the strategy was revised. This passive/potential construction
      is suitable for professional contexts where events are presented objectively. The polite 「〜しました」
      adds to the formal business tone.

    english_literally: If similar patterns are observable in various regions, it becomes a thing that

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 様々 な 地域 で 同様 の パターン が {見える} なら、我々 の 仮説 を 裏付ける こと に なる。
        english: If similar patterns are visible in various regions, it supports our hypothesis.
        hint: 「見えるなら」 suggests patterns are simply visible. 「見られれば」 implies that the patterns can be *discerned*
          or *identified* through observation, which is more appropriate for scientific or analytical
          contexts. We're looking for an expression that highlights the analytical observation, not just
          casual visibility.
    scene: A researcher presenting findings at an academic conference.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: conditional (～ば)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The 「〜ば」 conditional form 「見られれば」 is used here for a hypothetical condition in an academic
      context. The formal and objective tone, including phrases like 「我々の仮説を裏付けることになる」, is typical for
      research presentations. A female researcher might adopt this precise and analytical language.
post_example_writeup: This grammar point is versatile and often implies an observational effort or the
  existence of a specific condition that makes something observable. While `見える` conveys passive visibility,
  `がみられる` implies a more active engagement in the act of seeing or that something is noticeable as a phenomenon.
  Pay close attention to the nuance to use it effectively.
