    "writeup": "The grammar point 「までだ」, and its more emphatic variant 「までのことだ」, translate to \"merely (B)\" or \"simply (B)\". However, they are almost always used in hypothetical situations, conveying a sense closer to \"one can only but (B)\". This indicates the speaker's resignation or understanding that they have no other options beyond (B). It typically follows a verb in dictionary form and often appears at the end of a sentence using 「なら」 in the first clause. The structure signifies, \"If (A), then (B) is all that can be done,\" where (A) is usually a negative situation.\n\nTaking the meaning of the particle 「まで」 as signifying an extent, 「までだ」 expresses that (B) is the limit of what's possible given the circumstances caused by (A).",
    "etymology": "「まで」 implies a limit or extent. 「だ」 is the plain form of the copula 「です」, indicating a state or condition. Together, they express the idea that something is the only option up to a certain point.",
