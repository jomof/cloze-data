    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「までだ」combines the particle 「まで」 (until/to the extent) with the copula 「だ」 (is/it is). This combination asserts that a given action or state is the limit or extent of what is possible or necessary in a particular situation, conveying a sense of finality or inevitability. Historically, まで emphasizes boundaries or limits, and when paired with だ, it firmly states that something is confined within those bounds, leading to its current meaning of ",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「までだ」 and its variant 「までのことだ」 both convey the meaning of 'just,' 'merely,' or 'simply' the case. They are frequently used to express a sense of resignation or determination, indicating that a particular action is the only remaining option or the natural consequence of a given situation. This nuance suggests the speaker's acceptance of circumstances and their willingness to proceed with the stated action as the sole available course. While the literal translation might suggest a simple action, the underlying implication is one of inevitability; the speaker has no other choice.\n\nThis pattern typically follows a verb in its dictionary (plain non-past) form. It often appears at the end of a sentence where the preceding clause uses 「なら」 (if), particularly when describing a negative or undesirable hypothetical situation. In such contexts, it means 'if (A), then (B) is all that can be done' or 'if (A) happens, one can only (B).' The 'A' clause almost invariably describes an unfavorable circumstance.\n\nFor example, in a sentence like 「誰にも教えてもらえないなら、ネットで調べてみるまでだ。」 (If no one is going to teach me, I'll just look it up online.), the speaker expresses resignation to the fact that they must rely on the internet because direct help is unavailable. The act of searching online is presented as the extent of their options.\n\nThe inclusion of 「のこと」 in 「までのことだ」 adds a slightly softer, more explanatory tone, but the core meaning of inevitability and a limited range of options remains the same. Both forms emphasize that the stated action represents the boundary or limit of what is possible given the circumstances.\n\nUnderstanding the basic meaning of the particle 「まで」 as signifying an 'extent' or 'limit' is crucial here. The grammar point 「までだ」 retains this sense, with the speaker emphasizing that the action described is the ultimate extent of what can be done under the prevailing conditions. While primarily used in standard Japanese, its tone can range from casual to semi-formal depending on context and accompanying particles like 「よ」 or 「ね」.",

In contrast, 「〜しかない」 highlights the *absence* of other options, underscoring the limited nature of choices available. Think of 「までだ」 as 'This is what I'll do, that's all it is,' and 「しかない」 as 'There's literally nothing else I can do.'",

            "etymology": "The expression 「私 だけでも」 (even just me / by myself) uses the particle 「だけ」 (dake, 'only, just') and 「でも」 (demo, 'even'). 「だけ」 derives from words meaning 'limit' or 'extent,' while 「でも」 adds an inclusive or concessive nuance, often suggesting 'even if it's just this.' Combined, they reinforce the speaker's resolve to proceed alone as the simple, direct course of action, even if not ideal, which strongly resonates with the meaning of 「までだ」."

Its use here reinforces the idea that the lack of apology is an absolute, non-negotiable condition, making the subsequent action expressed by 「までだ」 an inevitable and simple consequence.

In this context, it explains the compelling reason behind the action taken, further emphasizing that the action described by 「までだった」 was merely the logical and simple extent of what could be done under the circumstances."

Thus, 「抱え込む」 suggests taking something entirely upon oneself, often a burden or problem, and holding it within.

When paired with 「言う」 (iu, 'to say'), it signifies the act of voicing dissatisfaction. The speaker's use of 「もう 参加 しない」 (will no longer participate) combined with 「までだ」 conveys a firm, simple, and decisive action taken in response to the perceived negativity, emphasizing that this action is the absolute limit of their tolerance."
