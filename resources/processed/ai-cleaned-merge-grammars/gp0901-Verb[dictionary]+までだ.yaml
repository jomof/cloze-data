        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a sentence-ending expression"
    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「までだ」combines the particle 「まで」 (until/to the extent) with the copula 「だ」 (is/it is). This combination asserts that a given action or state is the limit or extent of what is possible or necessary in a particular situation, conveying a sense of finality or inevitability. Historically, まで emphasizes boundaries or limits, and when paired with だ, it firmly states that something is confined within those bounds, leading to its current meaning of \"just\" or \"merely\" an action.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「までだ」 and its variant 「までのことだ」 both convey the meaning of 'just,' 'merely,' or 'simply' the case. They are frequently used to express a sense of resignation or determination, indicating that a particular action is the only remaining option or the natural consequence of a given situation. This nuance suggests the speaker's acceptance of circumstances and their willingness to proceed with the stated action as the sole available course. While the literal translation might suggest a simple action, the underlying implication is one of inevitability; the speaker has no other choice. This pattern typically follows a verb in its dictionary (plain non-past) form. It often appears at the end of a sentence where the preceding clause uses 「なら」 (if), particularly when describing a negative or undesirable hypothetical situation. In such contexts, it means 'if (A), then (B) is all that can be done' or 'if (A) happens, one can only (B).' The 'A' clause almost invariably describes an unfavorable circumstance. For example, in a sentence like 「誰にも教えてもらえないなら、ネットで調べてみるまでだ。」 (If no one is going to teach me, I'll just look it up online.), the speaker expresses resignation to the fact that they must rely on the internet because direct help is unavailable. The act of searching online is presented as the extent of their options. The inclusion of 「のこと」 in 「までのことだ」 adds a slightly softer, more explanatory tone, but the core meaning of inevitability and a limited range of options remains the same. Both forms emphasize that the stated action represents the boundary or limit of what is possible given the circumstances. Understanding the basic meaning of the particle 「まで」 as signifying an 'extent' or 'limit' is crucial here. The grammar point 「までだ」 retains this sense, with the speaker emphasizing that the action described is the ultimate extent of what can be done under the prevailing conditions. While primarily used in standard Japanese, its tone can range from casual to semi-formal depending on context and accompanying particles like 「よ」 or 「ね」.",

            "etymology": "The verb 「抱え込む」 (kakaekomu) combines 「抱える」 (kakaeru, 'to hold, to carry') and 「込む」 (komu, 'to become crowded, to go into'). 「抱える」 can imply holding a burden or problem. 「込む」 often adds a sense of thoroughness or inwardness. Thus, 「抱え込む」 suggests taking something entirely upon oneself, often a burden or problem, and holding it within. This reinforces the nuance of the speaker's personal resignation and determination to manage their difficulties independently, which aligns well with the self-contained resolve implied by 「までだ」."

The speaker's use of 「もう 参加 しない」 (will no longer participate) combined with 「までだ」 conveys a firm, simple, and decisive action taken in response to the perceived negativity, emphasizing that this action is the absolute limit of their tolerance."
