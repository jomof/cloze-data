    "writeup": "The sentence-ending particle 「わ」 is primarily used by women to add a soft, feminine tone to their statements. It can express emphasis, emotion, or seek agreement. Think of it as adding a touch of softness or charm to what you're saying.\n\nWhile mainly used by women, men may use 「わ」 to express surprise or light exasperation, especially in western Japan. The pitch differs noticeably from the female usage. Pay attention to the context and tone to understand the speaker's intent.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Feminine Use:** Adds a gentle, persuasive tone. Can be translated as \"you know?\", \"oh?\", or \"ever so (A)\", where (A) is something the speaker wants to emphasize.\n*   **Masculine Use:** Indicates surprise or mild annoyance about something unavoidable.\n\nIt is used after the plain form of words, including verbs, adjectives, and auxiliary verbs in their unconjugated forms, such as 「だ」 and 「です」.",
