    "writeup": "The sentence-ending particle 「わ」 is primarily used by women to soften their tone, emphasize a point, or express emotion. It can be translated as \"you know?\" or \"oh!\" depending on the context. It's attached to the end of a sentence in its plain form (e.g., verbs, adjectives, and auxiliary verbs like 「だ」 or 「です」). While historically more common, its usage among younger women has been declining. Men can also use 「わ」 to express surprise or light exasperation, particularly in western Japan, but with a distinct pitch difference from the female usage. Be aware of the potential for misinterpretation based on gender and context.",
