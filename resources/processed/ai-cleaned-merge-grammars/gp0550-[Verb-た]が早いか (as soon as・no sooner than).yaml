id: gp0550
meaning: as soon as; no sooner than; the moment that
meaning_warning: While often translatable as 'as soon as', it carries a stronger nuance of extreme immediacy,
  often with a sense of surprise or inevitability.
pronunciation:
  katakana: がはやいか
  romaji: ga hayai ka
formation:
  Verb[た形] + が早いか: Used to describe an action (B) that follows immediately and unexpectedly after a completed
    action (A). The verb must be in the past tense (た形).
jlpt: N2
etymology: The expression combines the past tense of a verb with 「が早いか」, which literally translates to
  'or is it fast?' or 'is it fast yet?'. This rhetorical phrasing underscores the extreme immediacy between
  two sequential events. It suggests that the second event occurs so rapidly after the first that there's
  barely enough time to register the completion of the first before the second is already underway. This
  linguistic structure evolved to emphasize the instantaneous and often surprising nature of the subsequent
  action, highlighting the speed and lack of a noticeable interval.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern **[Verb-た]が早いか** is used to express that as soon as one action or event occurs, another action or event immediately follows it. It emphasizes the extreme rapidity and close succession of the two events, often implying that the second event is an inevitable or surprising consequence of the first. The phrase conveys a strong sense of 'no sooner has A happened than B happened.' The verb preceding **が早いか** must always be in its past tense (た形).

  This pattern is typically employed to describe spontaneous or quick reactions, often by someone or something other than the speaker, or to describe natural phenomena. It is rarely used to describe the speaker's own intentional actions. The event described by the second clause is usually a factual occurrence, not a command, request, or speaker's volition.

  - term: '[Verb-た]とたんに (as soon as)'
    meaning: as soon as; the moment that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「とたんに」 is a very close synonym and often interchangeable. However, 「が早いか」 often carries a
      stronger nuance of extreme rapidity and a sense of surprise or unexpectedness regarding the second
      action, almost as if it happens *before* the first is fully completed. 「とたんに」 can be used for more
      general, objective immediate sequences.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-た]とたんに (as soon as)
  - term: '[Verb-る・た]やいなや (as soon as)'
    meaning: as soon as; no sooner than
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「やいなや」 is also very similar, emphasizing immediate succession. While often interchangeable,
      「が早いか」 might slightly emphasize the 'speed' of the occurrence, whereas 「やいなや」 can imply a more sudden,
      abrupt onset of the second action. 「やいなや」 can also attach to a plain non-past verb, unlike 「が早いか」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-る・た]やいなや (as soon as)
  - term: '[Verb-た]なり (as soon as)'
    meaning: as soon as; immediately after
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なり」 also expresses immediate succession, but it often implies that the subject of the first
      action *continues* to be involved in the second action or state. It can also carry a slightly unexpected
      or negative nuance. Unlike 「が早いか」, the subject is typically the same for both verbs, and the second
      clause often describes a state or action that *continues* from the first. 「が早いか」 is broader and
      can have different subjects.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-た]なり (as soon as)
  - term: と同時に (at the same time as)
    meaning: at the same time as; simultaneously with
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While both describe close temporal relations, 「と同時に」 implies two actions or events happening
      *at the exact same moment*. 「が早いか」 explicitly states that one action *precedes* the other, albeit
      by an infinitesimally tiny fraction of time, emphasizing the speed of the follow-up.
    grammar_point: と同時に (at the same time as)
  - term: てから (after and since)
    meaning: after; since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てから」 simply indicates that one action occurs after another. It does not carry the strong
      nuance of immediacy, surprise, or inevitability that 「が早いか」 does. The time gap between actions can
      be significant with 「てから」.
    grammar_point: てから (after and since)
  - term: たら (conditional, when・if A then B)
    meaning: when; if; after
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たら」 can indicate sequence ('when A, then B'), but it is much more general and does not emphasize
      extreme immediacy or an unexpected outcome. It can also express a hypothetical conditional relationship.
    grammar_point: たら (conditional, when・if A then B)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'When distinguishing **[Verb-た]が早いか** from other expressions of immediate
  succession like 「とたんに」 or 「やいなや」, remember that **が早いか** often carries a heightened sense of *surprise*
  or *inevitability* regarding the second event, as if it happens even before the first action is fully
  completed. While these expressions are frequently interchangeable, paying attention to this subtle nuance
  can help you choose the most fitting one. For expressions like 「てから」 or 「たら」, the key difference is
  the *degree* of immediacy: **が早いか** implies near-simultaneous occurrence, whereas the others allow for
  a more significant time gap.'

        english: After the alarm clock rang, he jumped out of bed.
        hint: 「てから」 simply states a sequence. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes the *immediacy*
          of the second action right after the first, almost as if it's an automatic reaction, even before
          the first action is fully processed.

        hint: 「と同時に」 implies perfect simultaneity. Here, the cat's action strictly *followed* the door

          perfect simultaneity.
