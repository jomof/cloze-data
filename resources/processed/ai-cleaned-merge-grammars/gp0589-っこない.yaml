    "writeup": "「っこない」 is a combination of the suffix 「っこ」 and the い-adjective 「ない」. When attached to the conjunctive form (masu-stem) of verbs, it creates new い-adjectives that express the impossibility of the verb's action. Common translations include \"there is no chance of (A)\" or \"doing (A) is impossible,\" where (A) is the verb used.\n\n*Important Consideration*: Although extremely rare, 「っこ」 stems from the kanji 「子」, so this grammar point may occasionally be seen written in its kanji form (as 「～子ない」).",
    "etymology": "The 「っこ」 part is likely a diminutive suffix, reinforcing the 「ない」's negation. It emphasizes the lack of possibility in a more emphatic way.",
