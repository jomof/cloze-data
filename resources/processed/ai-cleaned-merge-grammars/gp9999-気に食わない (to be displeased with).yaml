details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  function: Expresses strong dissatisfaction, dislike, or the feeling that something does not meet one's
    standards or preferences.
  nuance: Implies an internal, often visceral, feeling of displeasure or unacceptability. It is more about
    something rubbing you the wrong way or not sitting well with you, rather than just a simple dislike.
    It can also imply a sense of unfairness or annoyance.
  grammatical-role: predicate
etymology: The phrase 「気に食わない」 is a compound expression. 「気 (ki)」 refers to one's spirit, mind, or feelings.
  「に (ni)」 is a particle indicating the target or direction. 「食う (kuu)」 typically means 'to eat', but
  in this context, it carries an older, less common meaning of 'to bite into', 'to gnaw at', or 'to strike
  (as in hitting a target)'. Therefore, 「気に食う」 literally means 'to bite into one's spirit' or 'to suit
  one's mind/taste'. The negative form 「食わない」 means 'does not bite into' or 'does not suit'. Thus, 「気に食わない」
  conveys the feeling of something not sitting well with one's mind or spirit, or being displeasing.
writeup: |-
  The expression 「気に食わない」 is used to describe a strong feeling of displeasure, dissatisfaction, or a sense that something does not align with one's preferences, standards, or expectations. It often conveys a feeling of annoyance, irritation, or that something is unacceptable. While it can sometimes be translated simply as 'dislike', it carries a deeper nuance of something 'rubbing one the wrong way' or 'not sitting well' with one's sensibilities. It's often used when the reason for the dislike isn't purely objective, but rather a subjective feeling of discomfort or disapproval.

  This phrase is typically used in **casual** to **semi-formal** contexts. It's less common in highly formal or business settings, where more formal expressions of dissatisfaction would be preferred. It can apply to people, actions, situations, or even inanimate objects. When expressing dissatisfaction with a person's behavior, it implies that their actions or attitude are unacceptable to the speaker.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   **Subjectivity:** 「気に食わない」 expresses a subjective feeling. While the reason for this feeling might be clear to the speaker, it's rooted in their personal preference or sense of what is right.
  *   **Intensification:** It is a relatively strong expression of dislike or displeasure. Using it implies a significant level of dissatisfaction.
  *   **Usage with に:** When expressing displeasure with a person, it is common to use the 「～の態度が気に食わない」 (their attitude is displeasing to me) or 「～のやり方が気に食わない」 (their way of doing things is displeasing to me). While the grammatical structure allows for 「Person に 気に食わない」, it's less common than directly stating what about the person is displeasing.
false_friends:
  - term: 気に入る (to like, to be pleased with)
    meaning: to like; to be pleased with; to suit one's taste
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「気に入る」 is the exact opposite of 「気に食わない」. While 「気に食わない」 expresses dissatisfaction, 「気に入る」
      expresses satisfaction or liking.
    grammar_point: 気に入る (become fond of)
  - term: 気に入らない (to not like, to be displeased with)
    meaning: to not like; to be displeased with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「気に入らない」 is very similar to 「気に食わない」 in meaning, both expressing displeasure. However, 「気に入らない」
      often focuses more on a general 'not liking' or 'not being pleased with' something (e.g., 'I don't
      like this design'). 「気に食わない」 tends to imply a deeper, more visceral sense of something being unacceptable
      or grating on one's nerves (e.g., 'His arrogant attitude really rubs me the wrong way'). While often
      interchangeable, 「気に食わない」 can convey a stronger, more personal sense of irritation or disapproval.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:気にいらない (to not like)
  - term: 不満だ (to be dissatisfied)
    meaning: to be dissatisfied; to be discontent; dissatisfaction
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「不満だ」 is a more general and objective term for dissatisfaction. It can be used in formal contexts
      and often refers to a lack of something or unmet expectations (e.g., 'I'm dissatisfied with the
      service'). 「気に食わない」 is more subjective and emotional, expressing a personal sense of displeasure
      or annoyance, sometimes without a clear, objective reason beyond 'it just doesn't sit right with
      me'.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:不満だ (dissatisfied)
  - term: 納得がいかない (cannot accept or agree with)
    meaning: cannot accept; cannot agree with; cannot be convinced by
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「納得がいかない」 implies a lack of logical understanding or acceptance, a feeling of 'it doesn't
      make sense' or 'I can't be convinced'. It's often used when one finds a reason or explanation insufficient
      or illogical. 「気に食わない」 is more about an emotional or visceral reaction of strong dislike or displeasure,
      regardless of logical soundness. One might understand something logically but still find it 「気に食わない」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:納得がいかない (cannot accept)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between these similar expressions, consider the source
  and nature of the dissatisfaction. If it's a general lack of approval or a simple dislike, 「気に入らない」
  might be suitable. If the displeasure stems from unfulfilled expectations or objective shortcomings,
  「不満だ」 is appropriate. If you cannot logically understand or agree with something, 「納得がいかない」 is the phrase
  to use. 「気に食わない」, however, emphasizes a deeper, often subjective, feeling that something is fundamentally
  distasteful, annoying, or unacceptable to one's personal standards, even if there isn't an easily articulated
  logical reason for it.
examples:
  - english: His attitude really rubs me the wrong way.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 態度 が {気 に 食わ ない}。
      - 彼 の 態度 が {気 に 食い ませ ん}。
    english_literally: His attitude is displeasing to my spirit.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 態度 に 不満 だ。
        english: I'm dissatisfied with his attitude.
        hint: 「不満だ」 is more general dissatisfaction, often with a clear reason, whereas the focus here
          is on a visceral, personal sense of something being unacceptable. We're looking for an expression
          that conveys a strong feeling of dislike or annoyance that 'rubs you the wrong way'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 態度 が 嫌い だ。
        english: I dislike his attitude.
        hint: While similar, 「嫌いだ」 expresses a simpler dislike. We're looking for a phrase that implies
          a stronger, more internal feeling of something being unacceptable or not sitting well with one's
          standards.
    scene: A coworker is talking about a new team member they find difficult.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: Using 「気に食わない」 with 「彼の態度」 emphasizes a personal and strong negative reaction to someone's
      behavior, suggesting it's not just a mild dislike but something that genuinely bothers the speaker.
      The female speaker adds a slightly softer, yet firm, tone to this expression.
  - english: I don't like the way he talks.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 話し 方 が {気 に 食わ ない}。
      - 彼 の 話し 方 が {気 に 食い ませ ん}。
    english_literally: His way of speaking is displeasing to my spirit.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 話し 方 に 納得 が いか ない。
        english: I can't accept his way of speaking (logically).
        hint: This implies a lack of logical acceptance. We're looking for an expression of personal displeasure
          or annoyance, not necessarily a lack of understanding or agreement. We're looking for a phrase
          that conveys strong personal dislike.
    scene: Two friends are discussing a politician's speech.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: When a male speaker uses 「気に食わない」 about someone's 「話し方」 (way of speaking), it suggests a personal
      judgment and strong disapproval of their communication style, perhaps implying arrogance or insincerity.
      This is a direct expression of his subjective feeling.
  - english: The outcome of the meeting was not to my liking.
    japanese:
      - 会議 の 結果 が {気 に 食わ なかっ た}。
      - 会議 の 結果 が {気 に 食い ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: The result of the meeting was displeasing to my spirit.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 の 結果 に 不満 だ。
        english: I'm dissatisfied with the result of the meeting.
        hint: 「不満だ」 is a more neutral term for dissatisfaction. We're looking for a phrase that implies
          a stronger, more personal reaction of the result not sitting well with one's preferences or
          expectations.
    scene: A manager is frustrated with a recent business decision.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: Using 「気に食わなかった」 for a 「会議の結果」 (meeting outcome) conveys that the result personally displeased
      the speaker, indicating it goes against their judgment or expectations in a significant way. It
      suggests a more profound sense of personal dissatisfaction than a simple 'I don't like it'.
  - english: I couldn't stand the way that company handled the situation.
    japanese:
      - あの 会社 の 対応 が どう に も {気 に 食わ なかっ た}。
      - あの 会社 の 対応 が どう に も {気 に 食い ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: That company's handling is somehow displeasing to my spirit.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 会社 の 対応 が 許せ ない。
        english: I cannot forgive that company's handling.
        hint: 「許せない」 expresses an inability to forgive, implying moral outrage. We're looking for an expression
          of strong personal displeasure or irritation that doesn't necessarily imply unforgiveness. We're
          looking for a strong personal reaction that something doesn't sit well.
    scene: A consumer complains about poor customer service.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: Adding 「どうにも」 (somehow, no matter what) before 「気に食わなかった」 intensifies the feeling, indicating
      that the speaker found the company's handling absolutely unacceptable and irritating, beyond mere
      dislike. It highlights a persistent, unresolvable sense of displeasure.
  - english: I don't like his self-righteous attitude.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 独りよがり な 態度 が {気 に 食わ ない}。
      - 彼 の 独りよがり な 態度 が {気 に 食い ませ ん}。
    english_literally: His self-righteous attitude is displeasing to my spirit.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 独りよがり な 態度 に 腹 が 立つ。
        english: His self-righteous attitude makes me angry.
        hint: This explicitly states anger, which is a specific emotion. We're looking for a broader feeling
          of displeasure or something 'not sitting right' with one's disposition, which can include anger
          but is not limited to it. We're looking for a general sense of deep personal disapproval.
    scene: A mentor is discussing a student's problematic behavior.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: Using 「独りよがりな態度」 (self-righteous attitude) with 「気に食わない」 points to a specific character flaw
      that the speaker finds deeply irritating. The phrase itself conveys the speaker's personal standards
      being violated by such an attitude, showing a strong disapproval.
  - english: I don't like being told what to do by someone younger than me.
    japanese:
      - 年下 の 人 に 指図 さ れる の が {気 に 食わ ない}。
      - 年下 の 人 に 指図 さ れる の が {気 に 食い ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Being given instructions by a younger person is displeasing to my spirit.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 年下 の 人 に 指図 さ れる の が 嫌 だ。
        english: I hate being told what to do by someone younger than me.
        hint: 「嫌だ」 means 'I hate it' or 'it's unpleasant'. While true, it doesn't quite capture the specific
          nuance of something 'not sitting right' with one's standards, especially when related to perceived
          hierarchy or age. We're looking for a deeper, more personal irritation.
    scene: An older employee expresses frustration about a junior colleague.
    register: casual
    setting: professional
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This example highlights a cultural aspect where age and seniority often dictate interactions
      in Japan. For an 「年上の人」 (older person) to find 「年下の人に指図されるの」 (being told what to do by a younger
      person) 「気に食わない」 expresses a significant breach of expected social norms and personal irritation
      with that behavior. The phrase captures this specific cultural discomfort.
  - english: I don't like the noise coming from next door.
    japanese:
      - 隣 から の 騒音 が どう に も {気 に 食わ ない}。
      - 隣 から の 騒音 が どう に も {気 に 食い ませ ん}。
    english_literally: The noise from next door is somehow displeasing to my spirit.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 隣 から の 騒音 が うるさい。
        english: The noise from next door is noisy.
        hint: 「うるさい」 simply states that something is loud. We're looking for an expression of personal
          annoyance and displeasure stemming from the noise, implying it's unacceptable to the speaker.
          We're looking for a phrase that expresses deep personal irritation.
    scene: Someone complaining about their noisy neighbors.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: When 「気に食わない」 is used for 「騒音」 (noise), it emphasizes that the noise is not just loud, but
      personally irritating and unacceptable to the speaker, implying it significantly disrupts their
      peace of mind. The added 「どうにも」 strengthens this feeling of inescapable displeasure.
  - english: I was displeased with how the situation developed.
    japanese:
      - 事態 の 展開 が {気 に 食わ なかっ た}。
      - 事態 の 展開 が {気 に 食い ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: The development of the situation was displeasing to my spirit.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 事態 の 展開 に 納得 が いか なかっ た。
        english: I couldn't accept the development of the situation.
        hint: This implies a lack of logical acceptance in the past. We're looking for a phrase that expresses
          personal, emotional displeasure or something 'not sitting right' with one's standards, in a
          past context. We're looking for a subjective emotional reaction in the past.
    scene: A detective recounts a past case where things went unexpectedly bad.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: Using the past tense 「気に食わなかった」 indicates that the speaker felt significant displeasure with
      the past development of events, suggesting it went against their expectations or sense of propriety.
      The formal register implies a more considered, but still strong, negative assessment.
  - english: It's just that I don't like your way of doing things.
    japanese:
      - ただ 君 の やり 方 が {気 に 食わ ない} だけ だ。
      - ただ 君 の やり 方 が {気 に 食い ませ ん} だけ です。
    english_literally: It's just that your way of doing things is displeasing to my spirit.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ただ 君 の やり 方 が 好き じゃ ない だけ だ。
        english: It's just that I don't like your way of doing things.
        hint: 「好きじゃない」 is a milder, more general dislike. We're looking for an expression that conveys
          a stronger, more specific sense of something being unacceptable or grating on one's personal
          standards. We're looking for a more intense personal disapproval.
    scene: A senior colleague explains why they're hesitant to work with a junior colleague.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「ただ〜だけだ」 (it's just that~) combined with 「気に食わない」 makes the displeasure sound like
      a simple, undeniable fact for the male speaker, emphasizing his firm stance that the other person's
      「やり方」 (way of doing things) is simply not acceptable to him, often implying a lack of skill or proper
      procedure.
  - english: I don't like this vague explanation at all.
    japanese:
      - こんな 曖昧 な 説明 が まったく {気 に 食わ ない}。
      - こんな 曖昧 な 説明 が まったく {気 に 食い ませ ん}。
    english_literally: This vague explanation is completely displeasing to my spirit.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - こんな 曖昧 な 説明 は 理解 でき ない。
        english: I cannot understand this vague explanation.
        hint: This focuses on lack of comprehension. We're looking for an expression of strong personal
          dissatisfaction with the quality or nature of the explanation itself, beyond mere difficulty
          in understanding. We're looking for a phrase that implies deep personal annoyance with the explanation.
    scene: A student expressing frustration with a teacher's unclear explanation.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    nuance: Using 「まったく」 (completely/not at all) with 「気に食わない」 strongly emphasizes the speaker's total
      dissatisfaction with the 「曖昧な説明」 (vague explanation). It implies that the explanation is not just
      unclear, but also unacceptable and frustrating to the speaker's logical or intellectual standards.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「気に食わない」 can be used to express a strong personal
  sense of displeasure across various contexts, from general attitudes to specific actions or situations.
  It's often reserved for things that genuinely bother or offend one's sensibilities.
