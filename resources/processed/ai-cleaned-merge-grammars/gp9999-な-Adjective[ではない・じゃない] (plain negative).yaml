jlpt: N5
etymology: The ではない form combines the particle で (which originates from にて, meaning "by means of" or "in
  the state of") and はない. The は particle acts as a topic marker, emphasizing the negation. ない is the negative
  form of the verb ある (to exist/be). So, literally, it's like "in the state of not existing/being". じゃない
  is a phonetic contraction of ではない, reflecting natural speech patterns where wa often becomes ja when
  preceded by de.
writeup: The grammar point な-Adjective[ではない・じゃない] is used to express the plain negative form of な-adjectives
  and nouns. It directly negates the quality described by a な-adjective or the identity represented by
  a noun. ではない is the more formal and standard plain negative form. It is commonly used in writing, formal
  speeches, or when you want to sound more polite and articulate in a plain style. It maintains a clear
  distinction, making it suitable for situations where precision is valued. じゃない is a very common colloquial
  contraction of ではない. It is widely used in everyday conversation and informal writing. While grammatically
  equivalent to ではない in its negating function, じゃない carries a more casual and conversational tone. It's
  frequently heard in spoken Japanese among friends, family, and in less formal settings. It is crucial
  to understand that じゃない is not just a shorter version; its frequent use as a sentence-ending particle
  to seek agreement or express mild assertion ("Isn't it? / Right?") also adds to its informal and often
  emotive character. For instance, 「美味しいじゃない！」 (It's delicious, isn't it!) uses じゃない to invite agreement
  or express a strong personal feeling. While ではない serves a purely declarative negative function, じゃない
  can sometimes imply a certain expectation from the listener or reflect the speaker's surprise or confirmation.
  This grammatical structure is fundamental for building negative sentences with な-adjectives and nouns,
  forming the basis for more complex negative expressions.
false_friends:
  - term: じゃなかった
    meaning: was not (past plain negative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the past tense of じゃない. It negates a state or identity in the past.
    grammar_point: じゃなかった (was not)
  - term: ではない
    meaning: is not (formal plain negative)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: This is the more formal, non-contracted form. Use ではない for formal or written contexts.
    grammar_point: ではない (formal negative copula)
  - term: じゃない (question)
    meaning: Isn't it? / Right?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: When じゃない is used with rising intonation at the end of a sentence, it functions as a question
      tag seeking agreement or expressing mild assertion, rather than just a simple negation.
    grammar_point: じゃないか (isn't it?)
post_false_friends_writeup: When encountering ではない と じゃない, remember that ではない is the standard and more
  formal expression, suitable for most written and many formal spoken contexts. じゃない, while having the
  same core meaning of negation, is a highly common conversational contraction that can also convey a
  sense of seeking agreement or mild assertion when used with rising intonation. Distinguish じゃない (negation)
  from じゃない (question tag) by context and intonation. Additionally, じゃなかった is the past tense version of
  じゃない, so pay attention to the tense you need to convey.
