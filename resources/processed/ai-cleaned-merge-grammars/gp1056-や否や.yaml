        "Usage": "Often used in formal writing and speech to describe spontaneous or surprising events."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「や否や」 combines 「や」, a particle emphasizing what precedes it, with 「否や (いなや)」, meaning \"no\" or \"not\". It suggests that something happens at the very instant the preceding action occurs, leaving no room for negation or delay. 「否や」 itself comes from the verb 「否む (いなむ)」, meaning \"to deny\" or \"to refuse\".",
    "writeup": "「や否や」 is a formal expression, often found in written Japanese and formal speech. It conveys the meaning of \"as soon as\" or \"no sooner than\". The structure is attached immediately after a verb in its dictionary form to emphasize the immediacy of the subsequent action. It's often used when the result or subsequent action is spontaneous or unexpected. It is useful for describing situations where there is virtually no time between two events.",
