        "usage-context": "Used in formal writing and speech, often to describe spontaneous, sudden, or surprising events where there is virtually no time lag between two actions."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「や否や」 combines 「や」, an ancient particle used to emphasize what precedes it or mark a point of transition, with 「否や (いなや)」. The component 「否 (いな)」 means \"no\" or \"not\", and 「や」 here functions as a particle of doubt or uncertainty, similar to 「か」. Thus, 「否や」 literally means \"whether or not it happened\", suggesting an action occurs at an instant so swift that one cannot even confirm whether the prior action has fully ceased or not. This creates the nuance of extreme immediacy. 「否む (いなむ)」, meaning \"to deny\" or \"to refuse,\" is the root verb from which 「否」 is derived.",
    "writeup": "「や否や」 is a formal and somewhat literary expression, predominantly found in written Japanese, news articles, and formal narratives. It conveys the meaning of \"as soon as\" or \"the moment that\" one action occurs, another action immediately follows. The first action is typically a verb in its dictionary form, emphasizing the instant completion of that action.\n\nThis grammar pattern is used when the second action is spontaneous, sudden, or often surprising. There is a strong sense of direct causality or an extremely close temporal relationship between the two events. The time difference between the first and second action is perceived as negligible, almost simultaneous.\n\nIt is important to note that while 「や否や」 is the full form, sometimes the 「否や」 part can be omitted, leaving just 「～や」. In such cases, the meaning of immediate succession remains the same, but the form becomes even more concise and literary. This usage is common in traditional Japanese literature and poetry.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Immediacy:** The core meaning is the absolute lack of delay between event A and event B.\n*   **Surprise/Spontaneity:** Often, event B is unexpected or happens very suddenly.\n*   **Formal Tone:** This pattern elevates the formality of the statement, making it unsuitable for casual conversation.\n*   **Subject:** The subject of the first and second clauses can be the same or different. However, the connection between the two events must be very strong.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「～たとたん」 often suggests that an unexpected or surprising event occurs immediately after the preceding action, whereas 「や否や」 focuses purely on the strict immediacy without necessarily implying surprise."

            "nuance": "「～なり」 typically connects two actions performed by the *same* subject in immediate succession. 「や否や」 does not have this restriction; the subjects of the two clauses can be different."

            "nuance": "「～が早いか」 strongly emphasizes the swiftness of the second action and often conveys a sense of surprise or astonishment at how quickly it happened. 「や否や」 is more neutral in its implication of surprise, simply stating the immediacy."

            "nuance": "「～と同時に」 suggests two events happening concurrently or with a very short overlap. While similar in meaning, 「や否や」 highlights the absolute, instantaneous start of the second action immediately *after* the first, emphasizing no time lag."
