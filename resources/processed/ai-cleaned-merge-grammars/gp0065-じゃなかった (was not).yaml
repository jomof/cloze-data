details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: general
etymology: 「じゃなかった」 is the casual past negative form derived from the copula 「だ」. Historically, 「だ」 is
  believed to have originated from 「である」, which further simplified to 「ではある」 in the negative. The contraction
  「では」 to 「じゃ」 became common in spoken Japanese. Thus, 「じゃなかった」 is the past negative of this contracted
  form, equivalent to 「ではなかった」 but conveying a more informal tone.
writeup: |-
  「じゃなかった」 is the casual past negative form of the copula 「だ」. It is used to negate nouns and な-adjectives in the past tense, meaning 'was not' or 'wasn't'. The 「じゃ」 part is a contraction of 「では」, making 「じゃなかった」 a more informal and commonly used alternative to 「ではなかった」 in everyday conversation.

  To form the past negative with 「じゃなかった」, simply attach it directly to the noun or the stem of a な-adjective. For example, to say 'it wasn't a cat', you would use 「猫じゃなかった」 (neko janakatta). For a な-adjective like 「静か」 (shizuka, quiet), 'it wasn't quiet' becomes 「静かじゃなかった」 (shizuka janakatta).

  While 「じゃなかった」 is firmly in the casual register, Japanese offers more formal options depending on the context and your relationship with the listener:

  *   **ではなかった**: This form is slightly more formal than 「じゃなかった」. It retains the 「では」 and is often preferred in written contexts or more reserved spoken situations.
  *   **じゃありませんでした**: This is the fully polite form. It combines the polite negative present 「じゃありません」 with the polite past auxiliary 「でした」. This form is suitable for formal conversations, business settings, or when addressing someone of higher status.

  Understanding and appropriately using these variations is crucial for natural and effective communication in Japanese. The choice of form reflects the speaker's deference and the overall formality of the interaction.

  - term: ではない
    meaning: Is not, isn't
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「じゃなかった」 (past negative), 「ではない」 is the formal non-past negative. It means 'is not'
      and is typically used in more formal or written contexts, as opposed to the casual 「じゃない」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ではない (is not formal)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「じゃなかった」, 「ではなかった」, and 「じゃありませんでした」 all convey 'was not' or 'wasn't',
  their usage depends entirely on the level of formality required. 「じゃなかった」 is casual. 「ではなかった」 is a slightly
  more formal version often seen in writing or more reserved speech. 「じゃありませんでした」 is the fully polite
  form used in formal settings. Confusing these can lead to inappropriate levels of politeness. In contrast,
  「じゃない」 is the present tense equivalent, meaning 'is not', and should not be used when referring to past
  states.
examples:
  - english: Today wasn't Sunday.
    japanese:
      - 今日 は {日曜 日 じゃ なかっ た}。
      - 今日 は {日曜 日 で は なかっ た}。
      - 今日 は {日曜 日 じゃ あり ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: Today as for, Sunday was not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 日曜 日 {じゃ ない}。
        english: Today isn't Sunday.
        hint: This sentence expresses a present state. We need the past tense to say today 'was not' Sunday.
          We're looking for the past negative copula for a noun or な-adjective, not the present negative.
    scene: A busy student checks their calendar, realizing they misremembered the day.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The simple sentence structure and direct negation with 「じゃなかった」 are typical of casual, internal
      reflections, especially for a younger female speaker.
    etymology: 日 (hi) means 'day', 曜日 (youbi) means 'day of the week'. 日曜日 (nichiyoubi) literally means
      'sun day of the week', referring to Sunday. The combination of 日 and 曜 forms the days of the week,
      with 曜 itself referring to a 'day of the week' or 'luminary' from Chinese astronomy (Sunday is the
      'sun day').
  - english: That room wasn't very clean, was it?
    japanese:
      - その 部屋 は {あまり きれい じゃ なかっ た} ね。
      - その 部屋 は {あまり きれい で は なかっ た} ね。
      - その 部屋 は {あまり きれい じゃ あり ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: That room as for, not very clean was not, right?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 部屋 は あまり きれい {じゃ ない} ね。
        english: That room isn't very clean, is it?
        hint: This is a present tense statement. We need the past tense to say the room 'wasn't' clean.
          We're looking for a past tense negation of a な-adjective, not a present tense one.
    scene: A young man is commenting to his friend after visiting a messy apartment.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「あまり～じゃなかった」 softens the negative statement slightly, a common casual expression.
      The particle 「ね」 at the end seeks agreement, typical in friendly male conversation.
    etymology: 部屋 (heya) means 'room', combining 'room' (部) and 'shop/house' (屋). The character 屋 (ya)
      often refers to a building or a place where something is done, as in 'yaoya' (greengrocer) or 'pan'ya'
      (bakery).
  - english: Her explanation wasn't clear.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 の 説明 は {明確 で は なかっ た} です。
      - 彼女 の 説明 は {明確 じゃ なかっ た} です。
      - 彼女 の 説明 は {明確 じゃ あり ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: Her explanation as for, clear was not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 の 説明 は 明確 で は {ない} です。
        english: Her explanation isn't clear.
        hint: This sentence expresses a present state. We need the past tense to say the explanation 'was
          not' clear. We're looking for the past negative form of a な-adjective, not the present form.
    scene: A team leader is giving a concise report to a senior manager about a team member's presentation.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Using 「明確ではなかったです」 instead of 「明確じゃなかったです」 indicates a more measured and polite delivery,
      fitting for a semi-formal, professional setting where an older male speaker is reporting to a superior.
      明確 (meikaku, clear) is a な-adjective. The addition of 「です」 further elevates the politeness.
    etymology: 説明 (setsumei) means 'explanation', combining 説 (setsu) 'theory, explanation' and 明 (mei)
      'bright, clear'. The character 説 implies speaking or explaining a concept, while 明 gives the sense
      of making something clear or enlightened. 明確 (meikaku) combines 明 (mei) 'clear' and 確 (kaku) 'certain,
      firm'.
  - english: That report was not factual.
    japanese:
      - その ご 報告 は {事実 で は あり ませ ん でし た}。
      - その ご 報告 は {事実 で は なかっ た} です。
      - その ご 報告 は {事実 じゃ なかっ た} です。
    english_literally: That honored report as for, fact was not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その ご 報告 は 事実 で は {あり ませ ん}。
        english: That report isn't factual.
        hint: This sentence expresses a present state. We need the past tense to say the report 'was not'
          factual. We're looking for a past tense negation of a noun, not a present tense one.
    scene: A senior executive is calmly but firmly correcting a misleading statement made by a subordinate
      in a formal meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of the fully polite 「事実ではありませんでした」 is paramount in formal business Japanese, especially
      when delivering critical feedback. 「ご報告」 (go houkoku) adds a layer of respect to the word 'report',
      fitting the formal context. The nuance here is direct but respectful in a formal setting, highlighting
      the untruth without being overly accusatory. 事実 (jijitsu, fact) and 報告 (houkoku, report) are N3
      kanji.
    etymology: 事実 (jijitsu) literally combines 'matter' (事) and 'truth' (実), meaning 'fact' or 'reality'.
      事 (ji) indicates an affair or matter, while 実 (jitsu) refers to truth or reality.
  - english: It wasn't my fault.
    japanese:
      - 私 の せい {じゃ なかっ た}。
      - 私 の せい {で は なかっ た}。
      - 私 の せい {じゃ あり ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: My fault was not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の せい {じゃ ない}。
        english: It isn't my fault.
        hint: This is a present tense statement. We need the past tense to say it 'wasn't' your fault.
          We're looking for a past negative expression, not a present one.
    scene: A teenager tries to explain to their parents why they shouldn't be blamed for a broken vase.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「じゃなかった」 in 「私のせいじゃなかった」 conveys a casual, slightly defensive tone. It's a common
      phrase for a younger speaker asserting their innocence to a family group. This choice of casual
      form is appropriate given the familial context.
    etymology: せい (sei) here means 'fault' or 'responsibility', often written in kana when used in this
      context, but can also be written with the kanji 所為. The meaning 'cause, reason, or consequence'
      is fundamental to its usage.
  - english: The plan wasn't realistic.
    japanese:
      - その 計画 は {現実 的 じゃ なかっ た}。
      - その 計画 は {現実 的 で は なかっ た}。
      - その 計画 は {現実 的 じゃ あり ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: That plan as for, realistic was not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 計画 は 現実 的 {じゃ ない}。
        english: The plan isn't realistic.
        hint: This sentence expresses a present state. We need the past tense to say the plan 'was not'
          realistic. We're looking for a past negative for a な-adjective, not a present one.
    scene: Two colleagues are debriefing after a project failed to meet its objectives.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Using 「現実的じゃなかった」 in a semi-formal, professional setting allows for a direct but not overly
      harsh assessment. The speaker, being older, might opt for this slightly more reserved casual form
      when speaking to a close colleague. The nuance here is a professional, slightly disappointed assessment.
    etymology: 計画 (keikaku) means 'plan' or 'project'. 現実的 (genjitsuteki) is a な-adjective meaning 'realistic'.
      現 (gen) means 'present' or 'actual', 実 (jitsu) means 'reality', and 的 (teki) is a suffix indicating
      'like' or '-ic', forming adjectives.
  - english: This wasn't the original proposal.
    japanese:
      - これ は {元々 の 提案 で は あり ませ ん でし た}。
      - これ は {元々 の 提案 で は なかっ た} です。
      - これ は {元々 の 提案 じゃ なかっ た} です。
    english_literally: This as for, original proposal was not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ は 元々 の 提案 {で は あり ませ ん}。
        english: This isn't the original proposal.
        hint: This is a present tense statement. We need the past tense to indicate it 'was not' the original
          proposal. We're looking for a past tense negation, not a present tense one.
    scene: During a formal board meeting, a board member points out a deviation from the agreed-upon document.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The choice of 「元々の提案ではありませんでした」 is highly formal and appropriate for an older male speaker
      addressing a group in a business meeting. This emphasizes the seriousness of the discrepancy and
      maintains a respectful, official tone. 「元々」 means 'originally' or 'from the beginning', and 「提案」
      (teian) means 'proposal'.
    etymology: 提案 (teian) combines 提 (tei) 'present, submit' and 案 (an) 'plan, idea'. The character 提
      implies putting forth or presenting, while 案 denotes a draft, plan, or idea.
  - english: The weather wasn't pleasant yesterday.
    japanese:
      - 昨日 は 天気 が {快適 じゃ なかっ た}。
      - 昨日 は 天気 が {快適 で は なかっ た}。
      - 昨日 は 天気 が {快適 じゃ あり ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: Yesterday as for, weather pleasant was not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 は 天気 が {快適 じゃ ない}。
        english: The weather isn't pleasant yesterday.
        hint: The sentence describes something that happened yesterday, so the past tense is required.
          This is a present tense negation. We're looking for a past negative of a な-adjective, not a
          present one.
    scene: Two friends are casually discussing their disappointing camping trip from the previous day.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: Using 「快適じゃなかった」 is a casual way to express displeasure about the past weather among friends.
      The directness of 「じゃなかった」 fits the casual register. 「快適」 (kaiteki) is a な-adjective meaning 'comfortable'
      or 'pleasant'. The use by a younger female speaker to another female reinforces the casual and friendly
      tone.
    etymology: 天気 (tenki) 'weather' combines 天 (ten) 'heaven' and 気 (ki) 'spirit, atmosphere'. 気 (ki)
      has a broad range of meanings including 'spirit', 'mood', 'atmosphere', and even 'air' or 'gas',
      making 'weather' an apt combination of 'heaven's atmosphere'.
  - english: That wasn't the main point.
    japanese:
      - それ は {要点 じゃ なかっ た}。
      - それ は {要点 で は なかっ た}。
      - それ は {要点 じゃ あり ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: That as for, main point was not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ は 要点 {じゃ ない}。
        english: That isn't the main point.
        hint: This is a present tense statement. We need the past tense to say it 'wasn't' the main point.
          We're looking for a past negative form of a noun, not a present one.
    scene: A university student offers constructive criticism to a classmate after a presentation rehearsal.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The direct but polite tone of 「要点じゃなかった」 is common in academic settings among peers. 「要点」
      (youten) is a noun meaning 'main point' or 'gist', fitting for academic discussions. The slightly
      more formal 「ではなかった」 would also fit in this context for added gravitas.
    etymology: 要点 (youten) combines 要 (you) 'important, essential' and 点 (ten) 'point'. The character
      要 implies necessity or the core of something, making 「要点」 the 'essential point'.
  - english: The previous method wasn't efficient.
    japanese:
      - 以前 の 方法 は {効率 的 で は なかっ た}。
      - 以前 の 方法 は {効率 的 じゃ なかっ た}。
      - 以前 の 方法 は {効率 的 じゃ あり ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: Previous method as for, efficient was not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 以前 の 方法 は 効率 的 {で は ない}。
        english: The previous method isn't efficient.
        hint: This is a present tense statement. We need the past tense to say the method 'was not' efficient.
          We're looking for a past negative for a な-adjective, not a present one.
    scene: Engineers in a meeting are discussing improvements to a manufacturing process.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: technical
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Using 「効率的ではなかった」 conveys a professional and objective assessment in a technical discussion.
      For an older male speaking to a group of engineers, this phrasing maintains appropriate formality
      while delivering a clear message. 「効率的」 (kouritsuteki) is a な-adjective meaning 'efficient'.
    etymology: 効率的 (kouritsuteki) combines 効 (kou) 'efficacy', 率 (ritsu) 'rate, ratio', and 的 (teki) 'like,
      -ish', to mean 'efficient'. This construction is common for creating adjectives from nouns or concepts,
      indicating 'having the nature of' or 'related to'.
post_example_writeup: As illustrated by the examples, 「じゃなかった」 functions as the casual past negative for
  nouns and な-adjectives. For situations requiring more politeness, 「ではなかった」 offers a semi-formal alternative,
  and 「じゃありませんでした」 provides the fully polite option. Selecting the correct form based on your relationship
  with the listener and the context is crucial for fluent communication. Pay close attention to the speaker's
  age, gender, and the setting to choose the most appropriate nuance and level of formality.
