    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にすぎない」 is formed from 「に」 (a particle) and 「過ぎる」 (sugiru), a verb meaning \"to exceed\" or \"to be more than\". The 「ない」 (nai) ending negates the verb, creating the meaning \"not more than\". Therefore, the phrase literally means \"does not exceed\", conveying the sense of something being limited or 'no more than' a certain extent.",
    "writeup": "「にすぎない」 is a common structure in Japanese used to indicate that something is \"no more than (A)\" or \"merely (A)\". It is constructed from 「に」 and the negated form of the verb 「過ぎる」, meaning \"to exceed\" or \"to be more than\". The literal translation, \"to not be more than (A)\", closely reflects the English interpretations.\n\n「にすぎない」 is slightly formal but is heard fairly often in day-to-day speech. It can be used after verbs in any of their standard forms, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns. It is often paired with structures that emphasize the phrase even further, such as 「ただ」 (\"merely\") or 「だけ」 (\"just\"). In the case of 「だけ」, it will come between the target word and 「にすぎない」. Remember standard conjugation rules, such as adding 「な」 after a な-adjective before 「だけ」.\n\nIt may occasionally appear in set phrases, such as 「氷山の一角にすぎない」, which means \"to merely be the tip of the iceberg\".",
