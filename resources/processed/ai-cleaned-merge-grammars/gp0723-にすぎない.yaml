    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にすぎない」 is formed from 「に」 (a particle) and 「過ぎる」 (sugiru), a verb meaning \"to exceed\" or \"to be more than\". The 「ない」 (nai) ending negates the verb, creating the meaning \"not more than\". Therefore, the phrase literally means \"does not exceed\", conveying the sense of something being limited or 'no more than' a certain extent.",
    "writeup": "「にすぎない」 is a common structure in Japanese used to indicate that something is \"no more than (A)\" or \"merely (A)\". It is constructed from 「に」 and the negated form of the verb 「過ぎる」, meaning \"to exceed\" or \"to be more than\". The literal translation, \"to not be more than (A)\", closely reflects the English interpretations.\n\n「にすぎない」 is slightly formal but is heard fairly often in day-to-day speech. It can be used after verbs in any of their standard forms, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns. It is often paired with structures that emphasize the phrase even further, such as 「ただ」 (\"merely\") or 「だけ」 (\"just\"). In the case of 「だけ」, it will come between the target word and 「にすぎない」. Remember standard conjugation rules, such as adding 「な」 after a な-adjective before 「だけ」.\n\nIt may occasionally appear in set phrases, such as 「氷山の一角にすぎない」, which means \"to merely be the tip of the iceberg\".",

        "violation: Added 'conjugations' array as per schema rule: 'If the grammar point contains a verb in dictionary form (besides だ or です) or adjective in dictionary form, add a new array field at the top, called \"conjugations\".'",
        "schema: Added 'negative past plain (～なかった)' and 'negative past polite (～ませんでした)' conjugations to the 'conjugations' array to provide more comprehensive forms for the grammar point.",
        "schema: Ensured all 'japanese' example sentences have the grammar point enclosed in curly braces '{ }' for emphasis as required by the schema.",
        "schema: Added 'scene_rationale' to all example sentences that have a 'scene', as required by the schema rule 'Must be present if \"scene\" is present.'",
        "violation: Removed 'speaker_gender', 'listener_gender', and 'nuance' from examples 4, 14, 15, and 16 because the Japanese sentences themselves did not contain gender-specific language that could be quoted in the 'nuance' field, violating the rule: 'If there is a \"speaker_gender\" or \"listener_gender\", then \"nuance\" must mention the specific Japanese, in 「quotes」, that would only be spoken by that gender.'",
        "violation: Modified 'scene' for example 4 to remove explicit gender roles, aligning with the removal of 'speaker_gender' and 'listener_gender'.",
        "violation: Added two new examples (17 and 18) with explicit gendered language to satisfy the schema requirement for 'Example sentences should include at least one male and one female speaker_gender' and 'Example sentences should include at least one male and one female listener_gender'."
