        "function": "Functions as an indefinite pronoun or adverb, often indicating 'something' or 'nothing' depending on context. 「何か」 suggests an unspecified item or event, while 「何も」 indicates a complete absence or nullity in negative constructions.",
        "nuance": "While 「なにか」 introduces an element of indefiniteness or inquiry (e.g., 'something,' 'anything'), 「なにも」 functions to strengthen negation, meaning 'not anything' or 'nothing at all.' This distinction is crucial for accurate expression.",
        "source": "general Japanese linguistics",
        "colocation": "「なにか」 often collocates with verbs like 'ある' (to be/exist), 'する' (to do), '欲しい' (want), '食べたい' (want to eat), or in questions. 「なにも」 almost always precedes a negative verb form."
    },
    "etymology": "「何か (nanika)」 derives from the interrogative pronoun 「何 (nani)」 (what) combined with the particle 「か (ka)」, which here functions to introduce indefiniteness or uncertainty, similar to English 'some-'. 「何も (nanimo)」 combines 「何 (nani)」 with the particle 「も (mo)」, which in this context serves to emphasize totality within a negative statement, thus meaning 'not even anything' or 'nothing at all.' This usage of 「も」 to reinforce negation is a common pattern in Japanese.",
    "writeup": "「なにか (nanika)」 and 「なにも (nanimo)」 are fundamental expressions in Japanese for conveying concepts of 'something,' 'anything,' or 'nothing.' The choice between the two depends entirely on the grammatical polarity of the sentence.\n\n**「なにか (Nanika)」**: This form is used in affirmative sentences, questions, and when making offers or suggestions. It indicates an unspecified item, event, or condition. For example, if you are looking for 'something' but don't know what it is, or if you are offering 'something' to someone without specifying, 「なにか」 is the appropriate choice.\n\n**「なにも (Nanimo)」**: This form is exclusively used with negative verb endings, such as the plain form 「ない」 or the polite form 「ありません.」 In such constructions, 「なにも」 means 'nothing' or 'not anything at all,' emphasizing the complete absence or non-occurrence of something. It acts as a strong negator.\n\n**Usage Notes**: Both 「なにか」 and 「なにも」 are placed directly before the phrase they modify. For instance, if you want to say 'I didn't do anything,' you would say 「なにもしませんでした.」 Similarly, to ask 'Do you want to eat something?', you would say 「なにか食べたいですか.」\n\nIt is important to note that colloquial and dialectal variations exist, such as 「なんか」 for 「なにか」 and 「なんも」 or 「なんにも」 for 「なにも.」 These casual forms are frequently encountered in spoken Japanese but should be used with awareness of the context and register.",
