pronunciation:
  katakana: ガタイ
  romaji: gatai
formation:
  V[stem] + がたい: Indicates that something is difficult or impossible to do.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: formal
  usage-context: used for situations involving high objective difficulty or impossibility
etymology: 「がたい」 comes from the kanji 難 (むずかしい), meaning "difficult." It shares the same root, but functions
  as a suffix attached to verb stems, intensifying the sense of difficulty or impossibility.
writeup: 「がたい」 is a suffix that attaches to the masu-stem of verbs (verb stem + がたい) to express that something
  is **difficult or almost impossible** to do. Although it shares the kanji root 難 (difficult) with 「難しい」,
  its function as a suffix differentiates its usage. Unlike 「にくい」, which indicates difficulty based on
  subjective feelings, personal experience, or physical discomfort (e.g., 'it's difficult to do' or 'it's
  unpleasant to do'), 「がたい」 emphasizes the **inherent, objective difficulty or infeasibility** of the
  action itself. It conveys a stronger sense of impossibility, implying that the task or action possesses
  a high degree of difficulty or distress. Consequently, 「がたい」 is often used in more formal or serious
  contexts.
false_friends:
  - term: ようがない・ようもない
    meaning: There's no way to, it's impossible to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようがない」 and 「ようもない」 express that there is absolutely no means or way to do something, focusing
      on the lack of a solution. While 「がたい」 emphasizes the inherent difficulty of the action itself,
      these expressions indicate that an action is impossible because there are no feasible methods or
      options.
    grammar_point: ようがない・ようもない (no way to)
  - term: にくい
    meaning: Difficult to, Hard to
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「にくい」 indicates difficulty based on personal feelings, experience, or physical discomfort,
      implying 'it's difficult to do' or 'it's unpleasant to do'. In contrast, 「がたい」 signifies inherent,
      objective difficulty or impossibility of the action itself, conveying a nuance of 'virtually impossible'
      or 'extremely difficult'.
    grammar_point: にくい (difficult to do)
  - term: かねる
    meaning: cannot, unable to; hesitate to, find it difficult to (often for social/moral reasons)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「かねる」 implies a difficulty or inability to perform an action, often due to hesitation, reluctance,
      or social/moral considerations. Unlike 「がたい」 which focuses on the objective difficulty of the action
      itself, 「かねる」 emphasizes the speaker's internal constraint or inability to bring themselves to do
      something.
    grammar_point: かねる (unable to)
  - term: えない
    meaning: cannot, unable to (absolute impossibility)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「えない」 indicates absolute impossibility, often because something is conceptually or logically
      impossible. It directly means 'cannot' or 'unable to.' While 「がたい」 implies a very high degree of
      difficulty, suggesting something is *almost* impossible, 「えない」 conveys that it is *absolutely* impossible
      or beyond one's ability to comprehend or execute.
    grammar_point: 得ない (cannot・impossible)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing these expressions, consider the cause of the difficulty.
  If there are truly no means or options, choose 「ようがない」. If the difficulty arises from personal feelings,
  experience, or physical ease, 「にくい」 is appropriate. If the action itself possesses an inherent, objective
  difficulty that makes it almost impossible, 「がたい」 is the most suitable expression. For situations where
  one hesitates due to reluctance or social constraints, 「かねる」 is used. When something is absolutely impossible
  or beyond conceptual grasp, 「えない」 is the appropriate choice.
examples:
  - english: That story is hard to believe instantly.
    japanese:
      - その 話 は、にわか に は 信じ {がたい}。
      - その 話 は、にわか に は 信じ {がたい} です。

          - その 話 は、にわか に は 信じ にくい です。
        english: That story is difficult to believe instantly (due to personal feeling).
        hint: While both express difficulty, 「にくい (difficult to do)」 implies a subjective or personal
          difficulty, whereas 「がたい (hard to do)」 emphasizes an inherent, objective difficulty. We're looking
          for an objective difficulty.
    scene: Someone is told something very unexpected or extraordinary.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「がたい」 here indicates that the story's content itself makes it inherently difficult
      to believe, emphasizing the objective unbelievability rather than a personal feeling.
    etymology: にわかに (niwaka ni) means 'suddenly' or 'instantly', originating from a word describing sudden
      changes in weather or condition, thus implying something unexpected and quick.
  - english: The truth was too cruel to speak.
    japanese:
      - その 真実 は、あまり に 酷く て 言い {がたかっ た}。

          - その 真実 は、あまり に 酷く て 言い にくかっ た です。
        english: The truth was too cruel and difficult to speak (due to my discomfort).
        hint: 「言いにくい」 suggests a personal discomfort or reluctance to speak, but 「がたい (hard to do)」 emphasizes
          the inherent difficulty of speaking such a cruel truth, making it objectively hard. We're looking
          for an objective difficulty.
    scene: Someone had to deliver a harsh truth but found it inherently difficult due to its nature.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: Here, 「がたかった」 conveys that the inherent cruelty of the truth made it objectively difficult
      to utter, signifying a profound barrier beyond mere personal reluctance.
    etymology: 酷い (hidoi) means 'cruel' or 'harsh', with roots in words describing severity or harshness
      in nature or conditions.
  - english: She is full of talent, but she has a slightly unapproachable aura.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 才能 に 溢れ て いる が、少し 近寄り {がたい} 雰囲気 が ある。

          - 彼女 は 才能 に 溢れ て いらっしゃい ます が、少し 近寄り にくい 雰囲気 が ござい ます。
        english: She is full of talent, but she has an atmosphere that makes it a little difficult to
          approach her (for people in general).
        hint: 「近寄りにくい」 suggests a general difficulty or unpleasantness in approaching, but 「がたい (hard
          to do)」 implies an inherent, objective quality of her aura that makes approaching profoundly
          difficult. We're looking for an objective difficulty.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a highly skilled but aloof person in their office.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「近寄り がたい 雰囲気」 emphasizes that her aura itself creates an objective barrier to approach,
      making it profoundly difficult for anyone to get close, not just a personal feeling of discomfort.
      The respectful 「いらっしゃいますが」 and polite 「ございます」 maintain a professional tone.
    etymology: 雰囲気 (fun'iki) means 'atmosphere' or 'ambiance', combining 'wind' (風) and 'breath/air' (気)
      to describe the feeling or mood of a place or person.
  - english: That event became an unforgettable memory for us.
    japanese:

          - あの 出来事 は、私 たち に とっ て 忘れ られ ない 記憶 と なり まし た。
        english: That event became an unforgettable memory for us (it simply cannot be forgotten).
        hint: 「忘れられない」 states a simple inability to forget, while 「がたい (hard to do)」 emphasizes that the
          memory itself is inherently profound, making it objectively difficult to forget due to its nature.
          We're looking for something objectively hard to forget.
    scene: Survivors of a significant event reflect on their experience.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「忘れ がたい 記憶」 highlights that the event's profound impact makes it objectively and inherently
      difficult to forget, conveying a stronger sense of permanence than merely 'cannot forget'.
    etymology: 出来事 (dekigoto) refers to an 'incident' or 'event', often used for significant occurrences.
      記憶 (kioku) means 'memory', formed from 'record' (記) and 'mind/heart' (憶).
  - english: His actions were brave to an unbelievable degree.

        english: His actions were brave to an unbelievable degree (it was simply not possible to believe).
        hint: 「信じられない」 means 'unbelievable' or 'cannot believe,' indicating a simple impossibility or
          disbelief. 「がたい (hard to do)」 implies that something is objectively and inherently difficult
          to believe due to its nature or magnitude. We're looking for an objective difficulty.
    scene: A person recounts the incredibly courageous acts of someone during a crisis.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「信じ がたい ほど」 emphasizes that the sheer magnitude of his bravery made it objectively
      difficult to believe, almost defying comprehension, rather than just personal skepticism.
    etymology: 勇気 (yūki) means 'courage' or 'bravery', combining 'courage' (勇) and 'spirit/energy' (気).

          - あの 方 の 言う こと は、正直 信じ にくい ね。
        english: Honestly, what that person is saying is difficult to believe, isn't it? (I find it hard
          to believe).
        hint: 「信じにくい」 implies a subjective difficulty in believing, focusing on the listener's personal
          feeling. 「がたい (hard to do)」 emphasizes that the content of what is being said makes it objectively
          and inherently difficult to believe. We're looking for an objective difficulty.
    scene: A woman quietly expresses skepticism to a male colleague about their supervisor's recent statements.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「おっしゃる」 (respectful verb for 'say') and the sentence-ending particle 「ね」 in this
      polite context is common for female speakers seeking mild agreement or confirmation from a male
      listener. 「信じ がたい」 here implies that the content itself is objectively difficult to believe, not
      just a personal feeling of disbelief.
    etymology: 正直 (shōjiki) means 'honestly' or 'frankly', formed from 'correct' (正) and 'direct' (直).

    english_literally: Your charm, with words, hard to say beauty, isn't it?
    competing_grammar:

          - 君 の 魅力 は、言葉 で は 言い表せ ない 美し さ だ ね。
          - あなた の 魅力 は、言葉 で は 言い表せ ない 美し さ です ね。
        english: Your charm is a beauty that cannot be expressed in words.
        hint: 「言い表せない」 means 'cannot express' or 'indescribable,' stating a simple inability to put something
          into words. 「がたい (hard to do)」 implies that the beauty itself is so profound that it inherently
          defies verbal description, making it objectively difficult to articulate. We're looking for
          an objective difficulty.
    scene: A young man compliments his girlfriend on her beauty.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「君」 (a familiar 'you' often used by males to females) and the casual sentence-ending
      particle 「ね」 contributes to a slightly intimate and admiring tone, common when males express strong,
      somewhat exaggerated, feelings. 「言い がたい」 conveys that her beauty is so profound it objectively defies
      verbal description, not just personal hesitation.
    etymology: 魅力 (miryoku) means 'charm' or 'appeal', from 'attract' (魅) and 'power/force' (力). 美しさ (utsukushisa)
      is 'beauty', the noun form of 美しい (utsukushii) 'beautiful'.

    english_literally: As for them, that kind of big mistake committed, it is hard to understand.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 ら が そんな 大きな 間違い を 犯し た と は、理解 でき ない。
        english: It is impossible to understand how they could have made such a significant mistake.
        hint: 「理解できない」 simply states an inability to understand. 「がたい (hard to do)」, on the other hand,
          emphasizes that the mistake itself is inherently beyond reasonable comprehension due to its
          nature. We're looking for an objective difficulty in comprehension.
    scene: Two colleagues discuss a baffling error discovered in a project, trying to make sense of it.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
  - english: It was a scene too painful to watch.
    japanese:
      - それ は 見る に 忍び {がたい} 光景 だっ た。
      - それ は 見る に 忍び {がたい} 光景 でし た。
    english_literally: That, to see, hard to bear sight was.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ は 見る の が 辛い 光景 だっ た。
        english: It was a scene that was painful to watch (for me).
        hint: 「辛い」 indicates a personal feeling of pain or difficulty. 「がたい (hard to do)」 implies that
          the scene itself possessed an inherent quality that made it objectively unbearable to witness.
          We're looking for an objective difficulty in bearing to watch.
    scene: A person is describing the aftermath of a natural disaster they witnessed.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The construction 「見る に 忍び がたい」 expresses that the sight itself was so distressing that it
      was objectively difficult to endure. While gender-specific language isn't prominent, a female speaker
      might use this phrasing to convey a deep emotional impact in a narrative.
  - english: Once you fall into that trap, it's hard to escape.
    japanese:
      - 一 度 その 罠 に 落ちる と、なかなか 逃れ {がたい}。
      - 一 度 その 罠 に 落ちる と、なかなか 逃れ {がたい} です。
    english_literally: Once that trap into fall, quite hard to escape.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一 度 その 罠 に 落ちる と、なかなか 逃げ られ ない。
        english: Once you fall into that trap, you can't escape.
        hint: 「逃げられない」 simply states an inability to escape. 「がたい (hard to do)」 emphasizes the inherent,
          profound difficulty in escaping due to the nature of the trap or situation, implying it's almost
          impossible. We're looking for an objective difficulty in escaping.
    scene: A mentor warns a junior colleague about a problematic situation or pattern they might encounter
      in their career.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: cautious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「なかなか 逃れ がたい」 conveys that the inherent nature of the 'trap' makes it objectively
      and profoundly difficult to escape, rather than a mere inability. A male mentor might use this somewhat
      stoic expression to convey a serious warning.
post_example_writeup: While 「がたい」 is often used in formal or serious contexts, as shown in some examples,
  it can appear in casual situations when strongly expressing objective difficulty. It conveys a high
  degree of difficulty, almost to the point of impossibility. It is not used in imperative forms. The
  last example shows a somewhat flirty tone.
