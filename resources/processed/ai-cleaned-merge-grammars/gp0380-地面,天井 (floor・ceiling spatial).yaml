    "meaning": "on the ground; on the floor / on the ceiling",
    "meaning_warning": "While both refer to horizontal surfaces, 地面 is typically the 'ground' outdoors or a general 'floor,' while 天井 is specifically the 'ceiling.'",

        "part-of-speech": "noun",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Used to specify the location of something on the ground/floor or on the ceiling. Often used with spatial particles like に (ni), で (de), or から (kara).",
        "function": "To indicate location or surface.",
        "nuance": "地面 (jimen) often implies an outdoor or natural ground surface, or the general floor of a large area. 天井 (tenjou) exclusively refers to the ceiling. These words are precise for their specific surfaces.",
        "grammatical-role": "Nouns that function as locatives when paired with particles."
    },
    "etymology": "「地面」(jimen) combines 地 (chi/ji), meaning 'earth' or 'ground,' and 面 (men), meaning 'surface' or 'face.' So, 'ground surface.' 「天井」(tenjou) combines 天 (ten), meaning 'heaven' or 'sky,' and 井 (jou), which here refers to 'top' or 'well-like structure.' Historically, ceilings, especially those with coffers or beams, might have resembled the pattern of a well, or the term simply evokes the 'top' or 'sky-like' surface above.",
    "writeup": "Both **地面** (jimen) and **天井** (tenjou) are nouns that specify spatial locations, referring to the 'ground' or 'floor' and the 'ceiling' respectively. While they both denote horizontal surfaces, their usage contexts are distinct. **地面** typically refers to the **earth's surface outdoors** or a **general ground-level area**, such as a stadium floor. It can also refer to the **floor inside a building** in a more general sense, but often when discussing the material or the broad expanse of it.On the other hand, **天井** refers exclusively to the **ceiling of a room or building**. It's important to differentiate them carefully to avoid misunderstanding.When using these nouns, you will typically pair them with particles like **に** (ni) to indicate existence or location, **で** (de) to indicate the location of an action, or **から** (kara) to indicate movement *from* that surface. The choice of particle depends on the verb and the specific nuance you wish to convey.",

            "nuance": "Unlike **地面** (jimen), which refers to the ground or a general floor surface, **床** (yuka) specifically refers to the *indoor floor* of a room or building."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Understanding the subtle differences between **地面**, **床**, and **天井** is crucial for precise communication. Think of **地面** as the broader, often outdoor, surface, **床** as the specific indoor floor you walk on, and **天井** as the overhead surface inside. Similarly, do not confuse **天井** with **屋根**; one is internal, the other external.",
