jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  usage-context: general use
etymology: 「ところ」 literally means "place" or "situation." In this grammar point, it refers to the 'situation'
  immediately after an action has been completed, or the 'point' in time when an action was occurring.
writeup: 「たところだ」 is used to express that an action or event has just finished. It signifies that something
  has **just** been completed, implying that the completion is very recent and relevant to the current
  situation. It's similar to saying "just did (something)" or "have just done (something)." The 「ところ」
  can sometimes be shortened to 「とこ」 in casual speech, particularly when referring to this temporal 'point'
  or 'situation'. While 「ところ」 can also refer to a physical place, written as 「所」, in this grammatical
  construction, it exclusively refers to a temporal or situational 'point' of completion.
