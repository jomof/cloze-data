  Verb[た形] + ところだ: Indicates that an action has just been completed.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The noun 「ところ」 (tokoro) originally meant "place" or "spot". Over time, its meaning extended
  to abstract "points" or "stages" in time or a process. When combined with verb forms, it functions as
  a temporal indicator, pinpointing the exact stage of an action. For 「Verb-たところだ」, the 「た」 form signifies
  past completion, and 「ところだ」 marks that precise 'point' of completion, implying it just happened. This
  evolution from a concrete "place" to an abstract "point in time" is common in language for words referring
  to location.
writeup: 「Verb-たところだ」 is a grammar pattern used to express that an action has just been completed. The
  「ところ」 (tokoro) here refers to a "point" or "moment" in time, and when preceded by the past tense (た
  form) of a verb, it signifies that the action has reached its completion at that precise, very recent
  moment. This pattern emphasizes the immediacy of the action's conclusion. It is commonly used when the
  event has literally just finished, often within seconds or minutes of the statement. For example, if
  you just finished eating, you would say 「たった今 食べたところだ」 (I just ate right now). This conveys a sense
  of "freshness" about the completed action. This expression is highly versatile and can be used in both
  casual and more polite contexts simply by changing the ending copula to 「だ」 for casual speech or 「です」
  for polite speech. The core meaning of "just finished" remains consistent.

  - term: '[Verb-dictionary]ところだ'
    meaning: about to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This indicates an action that is about to happen, contrasting with 「Verb-たところだ」 which signifies
      an action that has just completed. The difference lies in the verb form attached to 「ところだ」.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ところだ (about to do)'
  - term: '[Verb-て]いるところだ'
    meaning: in the process of doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This implies an action that is currently ongoing, while 「Verb-たところだ」 specifically states completion
      in the immediate past.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]いるところだ (in the process of doing)'
  - term: たばかり
    meaning: just did
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both express "just did". 「Verb-たところだ」 emphasizes the point in time of completion, making it
      suitable for very recent, immediate past. 「たばかり」 emphasizes the short duration since the action
      finished, suggesting the action is still 'new' or 'fresh' in memory, and can refer to events that
      happened a bit longer ago but are still considered "recent" by the speaker. 「たばかり」 can also describe
      a state, e.g., 「生まれたばかりの赤ちゃん」 (a newly born baby). 「ところだ」 implies more immediacy.
    grammar_point: たばかり (just did)
post_false_friends_writeup: The core concept of 「ところ」 (tokoro) in these constructions is 'point' or 'stage'.
  When combined with different verb forms, it pinpoints the stage of an action. 「Verb-たところだ」 indicates
  the action has just passed that 'point of completion'. In contrast, 「Verb-dictionaryところだ」 means the
  action is at the 'point of beginning' (about to start), and 「Verb-ていいるところだ」 means the action is at the
  'point of ongoing execution' (in the middle of it). While 「たばかり」 also means 'just did', it has a broader
  sense of recentness and can apply to actions that finished a little while ago, whereas 「Verb-たところだ」
  focuses on something that has happened literally moments ago, emphasizing the recency and immediacy
  of the completion.

  it ideal for events that have finished mere seconds or minutes ago. Always consider the precise timing
  you wish to convey when choosing between these expressions.
