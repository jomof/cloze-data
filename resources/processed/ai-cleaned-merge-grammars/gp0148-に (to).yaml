        "function": "Indicates the recipient of an action or the target of a verb.",
        "nuance": "The particle 「に」 marks the indirect object, the recipient of an action. It's used to show who or what is receiving something.",

    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 has its roots in Old Japanese. Its origins are debated, but it's believed to have evolved from earlier forms indicating location or direction. Over time, it broadened to include marking indirect objects.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 primarily indicates the **recipient of an action**, specifically with transitive verbs that involve the transfer of something. This transfer can be a physical object, information, or even an emotional state. It highlights *who* or *what* is receiving the action or benefiting from it.\n\nCommon verbs used with this function of 「に」 include, but are not limited to:\n*   **あげる / くれる / やる**: \"to give\"\n*   **話す (はなす)**: \"to talk/tell\"\n*   **見せる (みせる)**: \"to show\"\n*   **投げる (なげる)**: \"to throw\"\n*   **教える (おしえる)**: \"to teach\"\n*   **電話する (でんわする)**: \"to call\"\n*   **書く (かく)**: \"to write\"\n*   **貸す (かす)**: \"to lend\"\n\nWhile 「に」 has other functions, such as indicating location, time, or purpose, in this context, its fundamental role is to mark the indirect object: the *to whom* or *for whom* an action is performed.",
