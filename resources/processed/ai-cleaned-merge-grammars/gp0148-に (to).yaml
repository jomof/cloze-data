    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 primarily indicates the **recipient of an action**, specifically with transitive verbs that involve the transfer of something. This transfer can be a physical object, information, or even an emotional state. It highlights *who* or *what* is receiving the action or benefiting from it. Common verbs used with this function of 「に」 include, but are not limited to: **あげる / くれる / やる** (\"to give\"), **話す (はなす)** (\"to talk/tell\"), **見せる (みせる)** (\"to show\"), **投げる (なげる)** (\"to throw\"), **教える (おしえる)** (\"to teach\"), **電話する (でんわする)** (\"to call\"), **書く (かく)** (\"to write\"), and **貸す (かす)** (\"to lend\"). While 「に」 has other functions, such as indicating location, time, or purpose, in this context, its fundamental role is to mark the indirect object: the *to whom* or *for whom* an action is performed.",
