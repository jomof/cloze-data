    "writeup": "「となる」 is a formal expression meaning \"to become\" or \"to result in.\" It is often used in writing and formal speech.  It's crucial to remember that while 「となる」 and 「になる」 both mean \"to become,\" 「となる」 is generally more formal.  The key is recognizing the context. In casual conversation, 「になる」 is perfectly acceptable. However, in a formal essay or business presentation, 「となる」 would be more appropriate.\n\n*   **Formality**: 「となる」 is more formal than 「になる」.\n*   **Usage**: It often describes changes, decisions, or outcomes.\n*   **Context**: Pay attention to the situation to choose the appropriate phrase. For example, 「雨天の場合は、中止となります」 (In case of rain, the event will be cancelled) sounds more formal than 「雨天の場合は、中止になる」.",
