    "writeup": "「多い・おおい」 is an い-adjective that means \"many,\" \"a lot of,\" or \"much.\" Unlike the English word \"many,\" 「多い」 cannot be used directly before a noun, except in relative clauses where 「多い」 acts as the predicate of the clause, not as a direct modifier of the noun. To directly modify a noun with the sense of \"many,\" you would typically use 「たくさんの」 or 「多くの」.",
