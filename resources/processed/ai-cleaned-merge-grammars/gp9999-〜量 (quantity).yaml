jlpt: N3
etymology: The kanji 「量」 (ryō) fundamentally means 'quantity,' 'measure,' or 'amount.' Its origin relates
  to measuring grains or liquids. As a standalone noun, it directly denotes quantity. When attached as
  a suffix, as in 「水の量」 (mizu no ryō), it functions to specify 'the amount of [Noun],' thereby emphasizing
  the measurable aspect rather than just the number of discrete units. This dual usage reflects its core
  meaning of measurement and enumeration.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「〜量」 refers to the **quantity**, **amount**, **volume**, or **capacity** of something. It can be used both as a standalone noun 「量」 (ryō) meaning 'quantity' in general, or as a suffix 「〜量」 attached to another noun, indicating 'the quantity of that noun.'

  When used as a suffix, 「〜量」 follows a noun, often connected with the particle 「の」, as in 「水の量」 (mizu no ryō - amount of water) or 「荷物の量」 (nimotsu no ryō - amount of luggage). This construction allows you to express how much of a particular item there is. It's particularly useful for things that are often measured in terms of volume, weight, or a collective amount, rather than just being counted individually.

  For example, you might talk about 「仕事の量」 (shigoto no ryō - amount of work) to describe your workload, or 「情報の量」 (jōhō no ryō - amount of information) when discussing data. You can use adjectives like 「多い」 (ōi - a lot/much) or 「少ない」 (sukunai - a little/few) to describe the quantity: 「量が多い」 (ryō ga ōi - the quantity is large) or 「量が少ない」 (ryō ga sukunai - the quantity is small).

  「量」 can also be used independently, such as when instructing someone to adjust something: 「量を調整してください」 (ryō o chōsei shite kudasai - Please adjust the quantity). It's a versatile term that covers a wide range of measurable aspects of things.

  - term: 数 (number)
    meaning: number, count
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「数」 specifically refers to a **count** of discrete items (e.g., 個数 kōsu - number of pieces),
      whereas 「量」 refers to a **quantity** or **amount** of something, which can be continuous or discrete
      items viewed as a collective mass (e.g., 水の量 mizu no ryō - amount of water).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:数 (number)
  - term: 分量 (amount・portion)
    meaning: amount, portion, share, quantity
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both refer to quantity, 「分量」 often implies a **given or specific amount** that is divided
      or allocated, especially in cooking or distributing. 「量」 is a more general term for quantity.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:分量 (amount・portion)
  - term: 程度 (degree・extent)
    meaning: degree, extent, level
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「程度」 focuses on the **level or grade** of something, often qualitative (e.g., 痛みの程度 itami
      no teido - degree of pain). 「量」 focuses on the measurable quantity.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:程度 (degree・extent)
  - term: くらい (approximate quantity or degree)
    meaning: about, approximately, to the extent that
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「くらい」 is a particle used to indicate approximation or degree, often related to quantity, but
      it *modifies* an amount or idea. 「量」 itself *is* the amount. For example, 「３キロぐらい」 (san kiro gurai
      - about 3 kg) vs. 「３キロの量」 (san kiro no ryō - a quantity of 3 kg).
    grammar_point: くらい (approximate quantity or degree)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「量」 from similar terms, remember that 「数」 is for countable
  items, focusing on the individual units. 「分量」 implies a specific, often allocated, share of a quantity.
  「程度」 is about the level or degree of something, which might not be numerically quantifiable. Lastly,
  「くらい」 is a particle expressing approximation of a quantity, rather than being the quantity itself.
examples:
  - english: The amount of water is small.
    japanese:

          - 水 が 少ない。
        english: There is little water.
        hint: While this sentence also conveys a small amount of water, it doesn't explicitly use the
          concept of 'quantity' as a distinct noun. We're looking for an example that highlights the use
          of '量'.
    scene: You are looking at a glass of water that is almost empty.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 荷物 が たくさん あっ た。
        english: There was a lot of luggage.
        hint: 「たくさん」 means 'a lot' but doesn't explicitly refer to the '量' (quantity/amount) as a specific

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「お酒の量」 emphasizes the *volume* or *amount* of alcohol consumed, which can sound
      slightly more objective or observational compared to simply saying 'drinks a lot'. The polite register
      「〜です」 is neutral for both genders.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 砂糖 を 適当 に 加え て ください。
        english: Please add sugar appropriately.
        hint: 「適当に」 (tekitou ni) means 'appropriately' or 'suitably' but implies a more casual or approximate
          addition without focusing on a precise 'amount'. We're looking for the specific term for 'suitable
          quantity'.

        english: The work that needs to be done today is ridiculous.

          work, which 「量」 provides.
    scene: A colleague is complaining to you about their overwhelming workload for the day.
    register: casual
    setting: sarcastic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「半端ない」 (hanpa nai) is very casual and often used by younger speakers or in informal
      settings to mean 'incredible,' 'ridiculous,' or 'no joke,' emphasizing the immense quantity. This
      combines well with the casual tone of the male speaker.
  - english: The quantity in the old package was larger.

    english_literally: Old package's side, quantity was more.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 古い パッケージ の 方 が 多かっ た です。
        english: The old package had more.
        hint: This sentence is grammatically correct but doesn't explicitly refer to the 'quantity' or
          'amount.' It's a more general statement. We want to be specific with '量'.
    scene: You are comparing two different versions of a product in a supermarket, noting the change in
      packaging and content size.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「量」 is highly versatile and can describe quantities of
  various items, from tangible objects like water and luggage to abstract concepts like homework and information.
  Pay attention to whether 「量」 is used independently or as a suffix with 「の」, as both are common and indicate
  a focus on the 'amount' rather than just a simple count or general 'lot.'
