    "writeup": "The adverbial particle 「だに」 shares a similar meaning to 「さえ」 and 「すら」 (\"even\"), but is more common in classical literature and formal speech. It presents something as a minimum example, implying that anything greater would be overwhelming. It's often translated as \"just (A)\" or \"merely (A)\". 「だに」 follows verbs in their dictionary form. This structure is formal, appearing more often in literature than in spoken language. However, it is relatively common in anime and manga when characters are being dramatic. Because it presents a minimum, it's often used with words expressing the difference between reality and fantasy, such as **想像するだに** (\"even in my imagination\").",
