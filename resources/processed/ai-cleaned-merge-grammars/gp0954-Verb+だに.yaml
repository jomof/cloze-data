        "particle-pragmatic-function": "emphasis",
        "usage-context": "Used in formal or rigid expressions, often found in classical literature or dramatic contexts.",
        "function": "Emphasizes the minimal degree or extent of an action or state.",
        "nuance": "Implies that even the slightest occurrence of X is enough to elicit a strong reaction, often negative or overwhelming, or that even X is beyond reach/expectation.",

        "grammatical-role": "Adverbial particle modifying verbs."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「だに」 is believed to originate from the classical Japanese word 「のみ」 (nomi), which also means \"only\" or \"just\". Over time, 「のみ」 evolved into 「だに」, taking on a more nuanced meaning that emphasizes the minimal action needed to trigger a strong reaction. It's often found in older texts and formal speech.",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle 「だに」 shares a similar meaning to 「さえ」 and 「すら」 (\"even\"), but is more common in classical literature and formal speech. It presents something as a minimum example, implying that anything greater would be overwhelming. It's often translated as \"just (A)\" or \"merely (A)\". 「だに」 follows verbs in their dictionary form. This structure is formal, appearing more often in literature than in spoken language. However, it is relatively common in anime and manga when characters are being dramatic. Because it presents a minimum, it's often used with words expressing the difference between reality and fantasy, such as **想像するだに** (\"even in my imagination\").",
