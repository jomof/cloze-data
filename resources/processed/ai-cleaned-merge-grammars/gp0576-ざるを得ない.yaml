    "etymology": "「ざるを得ない」 comes from combining 「ざる」, which is an old-fashioned 連体形 (attributive form) of the auxiliary verb 「ず」 (similar to 「ない」, indicating negation), with 「得る (える)」 (to get, to obtain) and 「ない」 (not). The literal meaning is close to \"can't help but do,\" expressing a lack of alternatives.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ざるを得ない」 expresses that one has no choice but to do something. It conveys a sense of obligation or inevitability. The construction is formal and is often used in writing or in serious conversations.\n\n**Key Points:**\n*   「ざる」 is an old-fashioned equivalent to 「ない」.\n*   This construction uses the `ない` form of a verb, dropping the final `ない`.\n*   For `する` verbs, 「せざるを得ない」 is used instead of 「しざるを得ない」.\n*   For `来る` (くる), 「こざるを得ない」 is used instead of 「きざるを得ない」.",
