    "etymology": "Most な-adjectives originate from nouns, often of Chinese or foreign (e.g., English) origin. They behave like nouns but take the な particle when modifying other nouns, distinguishing them from regular nouns that use の for modification.",
    "writeup": "な-Adjectives in Japanese are unique because they function as both adjectives and nouns. Most な-adjectives were originally nouns, differing only in their conjugation rules. The dictionary form ends with だ. The particle な is attached when describing another noun. For example, 綺麗な絵 (kirei na e) 'a pretty picture.' な-adjectives often come from foreign (Chinese or English) origin, which explains their unique conjugation rules.\n\nIdentifying な-Adjectives:\n\nA simple trick to distinguish な-adjectives from regular nouns involves using the adverb とても (very). If とても sounds natural with a word (とても綺麗 'very pretty'), it's likely a な-adjective. If it sounds unnatural (とても外 'very outside'), it's likely a regular noun. Adjectives are measurable while nouns aren't.",
