    "etymology": "Many な-adjectives originate from nouns, often words of foreign (Chinese or English) origin, which have evolved to take on adjectival qualities. The 'な' serves to connect these noun-based adjectives to the nouns they modify.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, many な-adjectives are originally nouns, differing from regular nouns primarily in their conjugation rules. The dictionary form of a な-adjective is often followed by 「だ」. The 「な」 is attached when describing another noun. 「だ」 or 「です」 is required at the end of a sentence, but 「な」 is required when using a な-adjective to describe a noun.\n\nMany な-adjectives are words of foreign (Chinese/English) origin. This is why they've evolved with unique conjugation rules.\n\nAs a learner, identifying a な-adjective compared to a regular noun can be tricky. Nouns connect with 「の」, while な-adjectives connect with 「な」. A simple trick is to use the adverb 「とても」 \"very\". If 「とても」 sounds natural with a word, it's probably a な-adjective; otherwise, it's likely a regular noun. For example, 「とても綺麗」 (very pretty) sounds natural, while 「とても外」 (very outside) does not.",

            "nuance": "This example shows how 「とても」 can precede な-adjectives, indicating the degree of the quality. This would be used between friends or family.",
