    "etymology": "Many な-adjectives have their roots in Chinese *kango* or more recently, English loanwords. Because they began as nouns, they still require the copula だ/です to function as a predicate.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, the vast majority of な-adjectives are originally nouns, differing from nouns only in having their own conjugation rules. The dictionary form of a な-adjective will always be followed by だ. The な is only attached when describing another noun.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n*   だ or です is required at the end of a sentence.\n*   な is required when using a な-adjective to describe a noun.\n\nな-adjectives are often words of foreign (Chinese or English) origin, which is why they have evolved to require unique conjugation rules.\n\n**Identifying な-Adjectives**\n\nIt can be difficult to identify a な-adjective compared to a regular noun. Nouns conjugate with の, while な-adjectives conjugate with な. A simple trick is using the adverb とても \"very\". If とても sounds natural with a word, it's probably a な-adjective; if it sounds unnatural, it's likely a regular noun.\n\nAdjectives are measurable (e.g., \"very big,\" \"very small\"), while nouns are not (e.g., \"very dog,\" \"very boat\").",
