        "grammatical-role": "Can function as a predicate at the end of a sentence (with だ/です) or as an attributive modifier before a noun (with な)."
    },
    "etymology": "Many な-adjectives have their roots in Chinese *kango* (漢字語), or more recently, English loanwords (外来語). Because they were originally nouns or noun-like words, they retain a nominal characteristic of requiring the copula だ/です to form a predicate. The particle な itself evolved from the classical Japanese attributive particle なる.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese grammar, な-adjectives, also known as adjectival nouns (形容動詞, keiyōdōshi), are a distinct class of words that behave similarly to both adjectives and nouns. While most originate from nouns, particularly Chinese loanwords (kango) or foreign loanwords (gairaigo), they have developed their own unique conjugation rules.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n*   **Predicate Use**: When used at the end of a sentence to describe a state or quality, な-adjectives are followed by a form of the copula, typically だ (plain form) or です (polite form). For example, 「この 部屋 は 静か だ」 (This room is quiet) or 「この 部屋 は 静か です」 (This room is quiet, polite).\n*   **Attributive Use**: When a な-adjective modifies a noun, the particle な is inserted between the adjective and the noun. For example, 「静か な 部屋」 (a quiet room).\n\n**Historical Note:** Many な-adjectives were originally nouns. Their nominal origin explains why they rely on the copula だ/です to function as predicates, much like regular nouns do.\n\n**Identifying な-Adjectives:**\nDistinguishing な-adjectives from regular nouns can be challenging for learners, as both can appear with similar structures. A useful heuristic, often taught to Japanese children, involves the adverb とても ('very').\n\nIf とても naturally precedes a word and sounds grammatically correct (e.g., 「とても 静か」, very quiet; 「とても 綺麗」, very beautiful), the word is likely a な-adjective. This is because adjectives denote qualities that can exist in varying degrees and thus can be intensified. Conversely, とても generally sounds unnatural when paired directly with common nouns (e.g., 「とても 犬」, very dog; 「とても 本」, very book) because nouns typically represent discrete entities rather than gradable qualities.",
