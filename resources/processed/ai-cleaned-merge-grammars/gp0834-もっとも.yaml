    "etymology": "もっとも is derived from the adjective 尤も (mottomo), meaning \"reasonable\" or \"justifiable.\" The conjunction retains this sense of acknowledging a previous point while introducing a qualification or exception. It implies that while the first statement has merit, there's another aspect to consider.",
    "writeup": "もっとも, sometimes written as 尤も, is a conjunction used to clarify that the preceding statement (A) is not the only consideration. Common translations include \"although,\" \"for all that,\" or \"with that said,\" depending on context. The speaker acknowledges the validity of (A) but introduces a qualification. The subsequent clause (B) often ends with が, けど, or けれども, signaling a contrast or additional information.  As a noun, 尤も means \"to stand to reason,\" a nuance that carries over to its conjunctive usage.",
