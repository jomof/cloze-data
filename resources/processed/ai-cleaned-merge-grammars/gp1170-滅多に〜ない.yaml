    "details": {
        "Register": "General",
        "Usage": "This grammar point is used to express that something happens very infrequently. It's often used to describe situations that are surprising or unusual because they don't happen often.",
        "Negative Connotation": "The grammar point often carries a slightly negative connotation, implying that the rarity of the event is undesirable or noteworthy."
    },
    "etymology": "「滅多」 (metta) originally meant \"disorderly\" or \"reckless.\" The phrase 「滅多に〜ない」 evolved to mean that something happens so rarely it's almost as if it never happens, implying a sense of disorder or irregularity in its occurrence.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「滅多に〜ない」 (metta ni ~ nai) is used to express that something **rarely** happens. It indicates an extremely low frequency, almost to the point of never happening. It is similar to 「ほとんど〜ない」 (hotondo ~ nai), but 「滅多に〜ない」 often carries a stronger emphasis on the rarity and unexpectedness of the event.",
