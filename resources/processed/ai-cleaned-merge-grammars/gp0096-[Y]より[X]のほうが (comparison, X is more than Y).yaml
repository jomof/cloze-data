details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to explicitly compare two items, actions, or qualities, highlighting the superiority
    or preference of one over the other. The 「より」 part can be omitted if the comparison is clear from
    context.
  function: To express a comparative degree or preference; to highlight one item's superiority over another.
  nuance: This pattern explicitly sets up a comparison between two items (Y and X), highlighting X as
    the greater, superior, or preferred option over Y. The explicit use of 「ほうが」 emphasizes the chosen
    'side,' making the comparison assertive and often reflecting a subjective opinion or a clear factual
    difference. It can be used in various registers.
etymology: The particle 「より」 (yori) means 'than' or 'from,' signifying a point of comparison or origin.
  The term 「ほう」 (方), originally meaning 'side' or 'direction,' evolved in this grammatical context to
  denote 'the side of X.' When combined as `[Y]より[X]のほうが`, this structure explicitly highlights X as being
  superior, or different, 'from' Y, thereby establishing a direct comparative relationship. This allows
  Japanese to express comparative degrees, akin to English '-er' or 'more,' without relying on adjective
  inflection.
writeup: The grammar pattern `[Y]より[X]のほうが` is fundamental for making comparisons in Japanese. Unlike
  English, which uses inflected forms like "bigger" or "faster," Japanese employs this explicit structure
  to indicate that one entity, action, or quality (X) is 'more' of something than another (Y), or that
  X is preferred over Y. The particle 「より」 (yori) is affixed to the item or action that is being compared
  *against* (Y, the lesser or less preferred item). Following this, 「のほうが」 (no hou ga) points to the item
  or action (X) that is greater in quality or the one that is preferred. For comparing two nouns (X and
  Y), the structure is `[Noun Y] + より + [Noun X] + のほうが + [Adjective/な-adjective]` (e.g., `リンゴよりミカンのほうが美味しい`
  - Mikan is more delicious than apples). For comparing two actions or situations (X and Y), it is `[Verb
  (Plain) Y] + より + [Verb (Plain) X] + のほうが + [Adjective/な-adjective]` (e.g., `本を読むより映画を見るほうが楽しい` - Watching
  movies is more enjoyable than reading books). When expressing desire or preference with verbs like `したい`
  (want to do) or `ほしい` (want/desire), both 「が」 and 「を」 can follow 「のほう」. Using `のほうが` (`[Noun Y] + より
  + [Noun X] + のほうが + ほしい/したい`) emphasizes the overall statement of preference or the desire itself. Using
  `のほうを` (`[Noun Y] + より + [Noun X] + のほうを + ほしい/したい`) emphasizes the object or action being preferred.
  The 「を」 marks the preferred item as the direct object of the verb of desire. Both are natural, with
  subtle emphasis differences. The `より` part can often be omitted if the context makes the comparison
  clear. For instance, if the comparison point is already understood, one might simply say `Xのほうがいい` (X
  is better) without explicitly stating Y. The explicit inclusion of 「ほうが」 makes the comparison more assertive
  and can convey the speaker's personal preference or a strong factual statement. Without 「ほうが」, a sentence
  like `XはYより[Predicate]` can still express a comparison, but it's often more neutral, simply stating
  a difference rather than highlighting one side's superiority or choice.
false_friends:
  - term: ほど〜ない
    meaning: Is not as…as, Isn't... like..., Not to the extent of...
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike `[Y]より[X]のほうが`, which states that X is *more* of a quality than Y or X is preferred,
      `ほど〜ない` indicates that something is *less* than something else, or not to the same extent.
    grammar_point: ほど〜ない (not as... as)
  - term: に比べて
    meaning: compared to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While `[Y]より[X]のほうが` emphasizes the superiority or preference of one item, `に比べて` is used
      for a more neutral comparison, simply stating a difference or similarity without necessarily implying
      one is 'better' or 'more' than the other in a subjective sense.
    grammar_point: に比べて (compared to)
  - term: たほうがいい
    meaning: It'd be better to, Should do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both express a 'better' option, `たほうがいい` is used to give advice or suggestions, whereas
      `[Y]より[X]のほうが` is used to state a fact about a comparison or a personal preference.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-た]ほうがいい (it is better to do)'
  - term: より
    meaning: More than, Over
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While `より` can appear alone to indicate a comparison, it often appears in more formal contexts
      or implies that `のほうが` is omitted for brevity. It lacks the explicit emphasis on the preferred 'side'
      that `[Y]より[X]のほうが` provides, making it a more neutral factual comparison.
    grammar_point: より (comparative)
  - term: よりむしろ
    meaning: rather than, more than
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While `[Y]より[X]のほうが` makes a direct comparison stating X is more of something than Y, `よりむしろ`
      implies a choice or preference for X *instead* of Y, often when X is unexpected or preferred contrary
      to initial thought.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:よりむしろ (rather than)
  - term: と〜と・どちらが
    meaning: between A and B, which is?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`と〜と・どちらが` is a question format used to ask for a comparative choice between two options,
      whereas `[Y]より[X]のほうが` provides the answer, stating which of the two is preferred or superior.'
    grammar_point: と〜と・どちらが (between A and B)
  - term: とは比べものにならない
    meaning: incomparable
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While `[Y]より[X]のほうが` establishes a comparative relationship by stating one is better than
      the other, `とは比べものにならない` asserts that a comparison cannot even be made because one item is vastly
      superior or inferior, making any direct comparison meaningless.
    grammar_point: とは比べものにならない (incomparable)
  - term: 一番
    meaning: the most, number one
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While `[Y]より[X]のほうが` directly compares two items to indicate one's superiority or preference
      over the other, `一番` is used to state that something is the absolute best, worst, or most extreme
      among three or more items or a group.
    grammar_point: 一番 (superlative)
post_false_friends_writeup: When making comparisons, `[Y]より[X]のほうが` explicitly highlights X as being superior,
  preferred, or 'more' of a certain quality than Y. In contrast, `ほど〜ない` indicates that something is *not
  as much* as something else. `に比べて` offers a neutral comparison, simply stating a difference without
  implying superiority. `たほうがいい` is specifically used for giving advice or suggestions, not for direct
  factual comparisons. `より` when used alone tends to be a more neutral factual comparison, lacking the
  strong emphasis on the preferred 'side' that `のほうが` provides. `よりむしろ` implies a choice for X *instead*
  of Y. `と〜と・どちらが` is a question asking for a comparative choice, whereas `[Y]より[X]のほうが` provides the
  answer. Lastly, `とは比べものにならない` asserts that no meaningful comparison can be made, as one item is vastly
  superior or inferior, and `一番` is used for superlatives among three or more items, not just two.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 猫 が 好き です、犬 は 好き じゃ ない です。
        english: I like cats, I don't like dogs.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 猫 は 犬 {より} 好き です。
        english: Cats are liked more than dogs.
        hint: This implies a general comparison but doesn't emphasize the preference as strongly as the
          original. We're looking for an explicit statement of preference.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 犬 を 飼う {より} 猫 を 飼っ た {ほう が} いい です。
        english: It's better to keep a cat than a dog.

    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「です」 (desu) at the end of the sentence indicates a polite register suitable for
      a friendly conversation. The comparison is straightforward, expressing a personal preference. The
      addition of 「わ」 (wa) or 「よ」 (yo) can add a feminine or general emphatic nuance respectively, commonly
      used in casual speech. 「っす」 (ssu) is a very casual, masculine contracted form of 「です」 (desu).

      - competing_japanese:
          - 書く こと は 読む こと {より} 難しい です。
        english: Writing is more difficult than reading.
        hint: This is a factual statement using 'より' alone, which is grammatically correct but lacks the
          explicit emphasis on 'which side' of the comparison is greater, as 'のほうが' provides. We are looking
          for the emphasized comparison.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 読む の は 書く ほど 難しく ない です。
        english: Reading isn't as difficult as writing.
        hint: This phrasing indicates a lesser degree or extent. We're looking for a direct comparison
          stating one is 'more' difficult.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 読む {より} 書い た {ほう が} いい です。
        english: It's better to write than to read.

          difficulty of two actions.
    scene: A language learner discusses the challenges of their studies with their teacher.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「です」 (desu) maintains politeness, fitting for a student speaking to a teacher.
      Comparing actions by their dictionary forms followed by 「のほうが」 is a standard way to express relative
      difficulty. Omitting 「です」 makes it casual. Adding 「よ」 (yo) adds a general assertive nuance, while
      「わね」 (wane) adds a feminine, slightly contemplative or agreement-seeking nuance.

          and preference between two items.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 新しい パソコン {より} 古い タブレット {の ほう が} 欲しい です。
        english: I want the old tablet more than this new computer (using 'no hou ga').
        hint: While similar, this uses 'のほうが' which tends to emphasize the overall preference. We're looking
          for 'のほうを' which specifically highlights the object of desire.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 新しい パソコン は 古い タブレット ほど ほしく ない です。
        english: This new computer isn't wanted as much as the old tablet.
        hint: This expresses a lesser degree of desire. We're looking for a positive statement about a
          stronger desire for one item over another.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 古い タブレット が この 新しい パソコン {より} ほしい です。
        english: The old tablet is wanted more than this new computer.
        hint: This expresses desire but lacks the strong emphasis on the preferred *item* that the original
          conveys. We're looking for a phrase that specifically highlights the object of desire in a comparison.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 新しい パソコン を 買う {より} 古い タブレット を 買っ た {ほう が} いい です。
        english: It's better to buy the old tablet than this new computer.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「のほうをほしい」 (no hou o hoshii) with 「です」 (desu) emphasizes the direct object (the
      tablet) of desire, making the preference for this specific item clear and polite, especially when
      it might seem counter-intuitive to the listener. Adding 「な」 (na) expresses contemplation, while
      「ん です けど」 (n desu kedo) provides a softer, explanatory tone, possibly seeking understanding.

          the lesser item first, setting up the comparison with greater emphasis on the preferred item.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 は 母 ほど 優しく ない です。
        english: Teacher isn't as kind as mother.
        hint: This expresses a lesser degree of kindness. We're looking for a positive statement about
          one person being 'more' kind.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 母 は 先生 {より} 優しい です。
        english: Mother is kinder than teacher.
        hint: This states a fact about kindness but doesn't necessarily convey the subjective feeling
          or comparison as strongly as the original. We're looking for a comparison that emphasizes the
          'more' aspect.
      - competing_japanese:

      relative like a grandparent, even when discussing personal feelings. 「優しい」 (yasashii) directly expresses
      the comparative quality. Omitting 「です」 makes it casual, appropriate for a child. Adding 「なあ」 (naa)
      expresses a reflective or empathetic feeling common in casual speech, especially from a younger
      speaker confiding a sentiment.

          - 東京 は 京都 ほど 静か じゃ ない です。
        english: Tokyo isn't as quiet as Kyoto.
        hint: This expresses a negative comparison or a lesser extent. We're looking for a positive statement
          about a greater degree of quietness.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 東京 に 住む {より} 京都 に 住ん だ {ほう が} いい です。

    scene: Two friends are discussing their favorite Japanese cities.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「です」 (desu) maintains politeness appropriate for a friendly conversation. 「静か」
      (shizuka) is a な-adjective meaning "quiet" or "peaceful." This sentence directly compares the atmospheres
      of two cities. Adding 「よ」 (yo) can add a gentle emphasis or confirmation.

          faster and preferred.
    scene: A project team is behind schedule, and a team member offers a quick solution.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The urgency of the situation and the suggestion of a proactive solution emphasize the preferred
      action with 「ほうが」. The use of 「〜よ」 in a more casual variant indicates a slight emphasis or a call
      for agreement, common in informal settings.

        english: Students are not as free as adults.
        hint: 「〜ほど〜ない」 indicates a lesser degree or lack of equality. We're looking for a phrase that
          highlights one side as having more of a quality.
    scene: A university student talks to a recent graduate about their life stages.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The reflective and somewhat wistful tone about life stages, particularly the contrast between
      student and adult freedom, can be common among younger female speakers reflecting on their experiences.
      The use of 「であるほうが」 emphasizes the state of 'being a student' as the preferred side. 「〜だよね」 is a
      casual sentence-ending particle used to seek agreement, often by younger speakers.

          trait.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: Speaking in front of people isn't as much liked as thinking alone.
        hint: This expresses a lesser degree of liking. We're looking for a positive statement about one's
          stronger preference as a personality trait.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一人 で 考える の が 人前 で 話す こと {より} 好き な 性格 です。
        english: Thinking alone is a more liked personality trait than speaking in front of people.
        hint: This is a factual statement about one's personality, but the original emphasizes the *preference*
          for thinking alone. We're looking for a comparison that highlights this intrinsic preference.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 人前 で 話す {より} 一人 で 考え た {ほう が} いい。
        english: It's better to think alone than speak in front of people.
        hint: This gives advice on how one should behave. We're looking for a statement about a personal
          inherent preference regarding one's personality.
    scene: An introverted person describes their nature in a casual conversation with a close friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: While the sentence ends politely with 「です」 (desu), the overall tone is casual due to the personal
      nature of the discussion between close friends. 「好きな性格です」 (suki na seikaku desu) makes this a descriptive
      statement about one's disposition, clearly indicating a preferred way of being. Omitting 「です」 makes
      it more casual. Adding 「ん だ よ ね」 (n da yo ne) makes it an explanatory, seeking-agreement phrase,
      common in casual conversation. 「な の」 (na no) also provides a softer, explanatory nuance.
  - english: Taking the train is more convenient than driving in the city.
    japanese:
      - 都心 で は 電車 に 乗る {ほう が} 車 を 運転 する {より} 便利 です わ よ。
      - 都心 で は 電車 に 乗る {ほう が} 車 {より} 便利 だ よ。
      - 電車 に 乗る {方 が} 車 を 運転 する {より} 便利 だ と 思い ます。
    english_literally: In the city center, the side of taking the train is more convenient than the side
      of driving a car.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 都心 で は 電車 は 車 {より} 便利 です。
        english: In the city center, the train is more convenient than a car.
        hint: This is a more direct and neutral comparison. We're looking for a structure that emphasizes
          the choice or 'side' of taking the train as being better.
    scene: An older female colleague offering advice to a younger male colleague about city commuting.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 'The use of 「わよ」 by an older female speaker adds a gentle but firm assertion, common when
      offering seasoned advice. It softens the statement slightly while still emphasizing the speaker''s
      experience-based preference. The comparison is between two actions: 「電車に乗る」 (taking the train) and
      「車を運転する」 (driving a car).'
post_example_writeup: As shown in these examples, `[Y]より[X]のほうが` is a highly versatile and essential grammar
  pattern for expressing comparisons and preferences. Mastering it allows for nuanced statements about
  what is better, preferred, or possesses a quality to a higher degree. Always ensure the item being compared
  against (Y) is marked by `より`, and the preferred or 'more' item (X) is followed by `のほうが` or `のほうを`.
  Pay close attention to the particles used with `ほうが`—it's often `の` for nouns and the plain form for
  verbs and adjectives. Remember that the `より` part can sometimes be omitted if the context of comparison
  is already clear, which often happens in natural conversation.
