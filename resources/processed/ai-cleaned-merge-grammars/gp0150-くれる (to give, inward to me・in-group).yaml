etymology: 'The verb 「くれる」 is an ancient Japanese word, dating back to Old Japanese. Its original meaning
  was simply ''to give,'' but over time, it developed the specific nuance of the direction of giving:
  ''to give *to the speaker* or the speaker''s immediate circle.'' This directional aspect became distinct
  from verbs like 「あげる」 which imply giving ''away from the speaker'' or to an outsider. This distinction
  reflects a deep-seated cultural emphasis in Japanese on in-group/out-group relationships and the subtle
  expressions of gratitude and obligation within those dynamics. The ''in-group'' concept itself is central
  to understanding the historical development of these giving/receiving verbs.'
writeup: |-
  「くれる」 is a fundamental verb in Japanese that expresses the act of giving. However, unlike English 'to give,' Japanese has different verbs depending on the direction of the giving and the relationship between the giver and the receiver. 「くれる」 is specifically used when someone gives something **to the speaker** or **to someone within the speaker's close circle** (e.g., family, close friends). It always implies that the recipient is the speaker or a member of their in-group, and it often carries a nuance of gratitude, as the giving is perceived as a benefit received.

  This verb is essential for understanding the intricate system of 'giving and receiving' verbs in Japanese, which also includes 「あげる」 (to give, away from the speaker/in-group) and 「もらう」 (to receive). The choice of verb reflects the speaker's perspective and the social context of the interaction.

  While 「くれる」 can be used for tangible items, it is also frequently used in its `Verb[て]くれる` form to express that someone performs an action or favor for the speaker or their in-group. This structure emphasizes the benefit of that action.

  It's important to remember that 「くれる」 cannot be used when the speaker is the one giving something to an outsider. For that, you would use 「あげる」 or 「差し上げる」 (humble).
false_friends:
  - term: あげる・やる (to give, outward)
    meaning: to give (to someone outside one's in-group or to a lower-status person/animal)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While 「くれる」 implies giving to one's in-group, 「あげる」 (and its more casual equivalent 「やる」)
      implies giving something *away* from the speaker or their in-group, or to someone of equal or higher
      status. The focus is on the giver's action.
    grammar_point: あげる・やる (to give, outward)
  - term: もらう (to receive)
    meaning: to receive (from someone)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「もらう」 expresses receiving from the recipient's perspective, whereas 「くれる」 expresses giving
      from the giver's perspective, but with the speaker or in-group as the recipient. Both verbs describe
      the same transfer, but from different viewpoints.
    grammar_point: もらう (to receive)
  - term: 差し上げる (to give, humble)
    meaning: to humbly give (to a superior)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「差し上げる」 is a humble form of 「あげる」, used when the speaker gives something to a person of higher
      status. It does not carry the 'in-group receives' nuance of 「くれる」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:差し上げる (to give, humble)
  - term: いただく (to receive, humble)
    meaning: to humbly receive (from a superior)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いただく」 is a humble form of 「もらう」, used when the speaker receives something from a person of
      higher status. Like 「もらう」, it focuses on the act of receiving, not the giving from an external party
      to one's in-group as 「くれる」 does.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:いただく (to receive, humble)
post_false_friends_writeup: The core distinction between 「くれる」, 「あげる」, and 「もらう」 lies in the direction
  of the action relative to the speaker and their in-group. 「くれる」 is always used when the action benefits
  the speaker or their in-group. 「あげる」 is used when the action benefits someone outside the speaker's
  in-group. 「もらう」 is used when the speaker or their in-group receives something, focusing on the act of
  reception.

          - 頼む から、五 ドル 貸し て くれ！
        english: Please, lend me five dollars!
        hint: 「貸して くれ」 explicitly states 'lend me'. This example uses the more direct 'give me' implying

    scene: A person urgently asking a friend for money.
    register: casual
    setting: emergency/alarm
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    nuance: The direct imperative 「くれ」 in this context, combined with 「頼む から」 (Please!), conveys a sense
      of urgency and desperation, typical in informal, high-stakes situations. It's a very direct plea
      from the speaker for the listener to act for the speaker's benefit.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「くれる」 is highly versatile and appears in various
  conjugations and contexts. Its consistent core meaning is that of a benefit or item being provided to
  the speaker or their inner circle. Pay close attention to the implied direction of the action when choosing
  between 「くれる」, 「あげる」, and 「もらう」.
