  Person が/は + Speaker/In-Group Member に + Object を + くれる: Someone gives an object to the speaker or someone

  Verb (て-form) + くれる: Someone performs an action for the benefit of the speaker or their in-group.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  usage-context: Used when someone gives an object or performs an action for the benefit of the speaker
    or someone in the speaker's in-group. The giver is typically of equal or lower status compared to
    the receiver (the speaker or in-group member).
  function: To indicate that an object is given or a beneficial action is performed by someone for the
    speaker or a member of their in-group.
  nuance: Expresses gratitude or appreciation from the speaker's perspective for the received action or
    item.
  counterpoint: Contrast with 「あげる」, which is used when the speaker gives to someone else, and 「もらう」,
    which is used when the speaker receives something.
  logical-flow: Action by A (giver) → Benefit to B (receiver, speaker/in-group)
  temporal-flow: Action occurs, then benefit is received.
  spatial-flow: The verb 「くれる」 inherently describes an action or object moving towards the speaker or
    their in-group. This implies a spatial flow from an external source to the speaker's immediate circle,
    representing an 'inward' direction of benefit. This inherent directionality is crucial for distinguishing
    it from other verbs of giving and receiving, which imply outward or neutral movement. For example,
    when someone gives something to the speaker, the action flows from the giver to the receiver (speaker).
    This inward flow is fundamental to mastering 「くれる」.
etymology: The verb 「くれる」 (kureru) has roots in Old Japanese, deriving from 「くす」 (kusu), meaning 'to give'.
  It later evolved to 「呉る (くれる)», meaning 'to give' or 'to grant.' It also shares phonetic and possibly
  conceptual connections with 「暮れる (くれる)」, which meant 'to become dark' or 'to set (of the sun),' implying
  an action directed towards the observer or receiver. Over time, its meaning specialized to indicate
  giving specifically to the speaker or someone close to them, evolving into the directional sense we
  use today, where the benefit flows 'inward' towards the speaker's group, emphasizing a benefit received
  by the speaker or their personal sphere.
writeup: |-
  The verb 「くれる」 is fundamental for expressing actions or items given specifically **towards you** (the speaker) or someone within your close circle, such as a family member or close friend. It can be used both as a main verb for giving an object directly and as an auxiliary verb following the て-form of another verb to signify that someone performs an action as a favor for the speaker or their in-group. In both cases, the core implication is that the receiver benefits from the action or item.

  This inward directionality is a **fundamental distinction** from other giving and receiving verbs in Japanese:
  *   **くれる**: Someone gives something (object or action) *to me/my in-group*, emphasizing the benefit to the receiver.
  *   **あげる**: I give something *to someone else*, or someone gives something *to someone else*. The emphasis is on the giver's action.
  *   **もらう**: I *receive* something from someone, or someone *receives* something from someone else. The emphasis is on the receiver's action.

  In terms of social hierarchy, 「くれる」 is typically used when the giver is of **equal or lower status** than the receiver (you or your in-group). When a person of higher status gives something to you or your in-group, the honorific verb 「くださる」 is generally used instead. Conversely, when you (or your in-group) give to a person of higher status, 「差し上げる」 is used.

  While the kanji 「呉」 exists, it is very common to see this verb written entirely in hiragana as 「くれる」, especially in casual contexts. Understanding the directionality of the action is paramount to correctly using 「くれる」. Its usage often carries an underlying nuance of gratitude, as it describes a beneficial action performed by someone else. The distinction between an 'in-group' and an 'out-group' is culturally significant in Japanese; 「くれる」 is reserved for actions benefiting your in-group.

    meaning: to give (outward)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あげる」 describes giving *outward* from the speaker or their in-group, whereas 「くれる」 describes

    meaning: to receive
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「もらう」 focuses on the recipient's act of receiving, whereas 「くれる」 focuses on the giver's act
      of giving to the speaker or in-group. They describe the same transaction from different viewpoints.
    grammar_point: もらう (to receive)
  - term: 差し上げる (sashiageru)
    meaning: to give (humble form)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「差し上げる」 is a humble way to say 'to give,' used when the speaker (or their in-group) gives
      something to someone of higher status. In contrast, 「くれる」 is used when receiving from someone of
      equal or lower status, and implies a benefit to the receiver (the speaker or their in-group).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:差し上げる (humble give)
  - term: くださる (kudasaru)
    meaning: to give (honorific form)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「くださる」 is the honorific version of 'to give,' used when someone of higher status gives something
      to you (or your in-group). 「くれる」 is used when receiving from someone of equal or lower status, and
      implies a benefit to the receiver (the speaker or their in-group).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:くださる (honorific give)
  - term: いただく
    meaning: to humbly receive
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いただく」 can be used instead of 「もらう」 to show humbleness toward the giver of the favor.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:いただく (to humbly receive)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key to choosing the correct giving or receiving verb is to identify the
  direction of the action relative to the speaker or their in-group, as well as the relative social status
  of the giver and receiver. 「くれる」 describes an action or item given *inward* to the speaker or their
  in-group, from someone of equal or lower status. If you are the receiver (or someone close to you is)
  and the giver is of equal or lower status, 「くれる」 is appropriate. If you are giving, use 「あげる」 or 「差し上げる」,
  depending on the receiver's status. If you are receiving, use 「もらう」, or if the giver is of higher status,
  they would use 「くださる」 for the act of giving to you. The choice of verb subtly conveys these crucial
  social relationships and the direction of the benefit.

    nuance: The direct and somewhat demanding tone of 「くれない」 and the casual phrase 「ちょっと 怒ってる」 are typical
      of an older sibling (or person) complaining about a younger one's behavior, reflecting a subtle
      assertion of seniority. It is common for older siblings to use less polite forms with younger siblings,
      even in situations of complaint.

      - competing_japanese:
          - すみ ませ ん、その しお を {もらえ ませ ん か}？
        english: Excuse me, can't I receive that salt?
        hint: This means 'Can't I *receive* that salt from you?'. While grammatically possible, 「くれませんか」

    scene: A child is trying to convince their parent to give them money for a new toy or gadget.
    register: casual
    setting: persuasive
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The direct request for money using 「くれたら」 combined with the childlike aspiration 「新しい カメラ
      を 買うよ」 clearly indicates a younger speaker, likely a child speaking to a parent. While a parent
      is typically higher status, children often use 「くれる」 casually when discussing benefits to themselves,
      especially in an emotional or persuasive context.

  - english: My pet cat always waits for me when I come home.
    japanese:
      - 飼い 猫 が いつ も 家 に 帰る と 待っ て {くれ ます}。
      - 飼い 猫 が いつ も 家 に 帰る と 待っ て {くれる}。
    english_literally: Pet cat always home return when waits for me.

        english: My pet cat always waits when I come home.

    scene: A person expresses their affection for their pet, highlighting its loyalty.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: Using 「待ってくれます」 for a pet expresses the speaker's deep affection and appreciation, as if the
      pet's waiting is a conscious act of kindness or loyalty performed specifically for the owner's benefit.
      This personifies the animal's behavior.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, the core meaning of 「くれる」 consistently revolves
  around an action or item being given or performed *for the benefit of the speaker or their in-group*.
  Whether it's a physical object, assistance, permission, or even just time, the directionality towards
  'us' is constant. While the specific nuance and politeness level change with conjugation and context,
  the underlying sense of benefit remains. Always pay close attention to who is the recipient of the action
  to correctly determine if 「くれる」 is the appropriate choice, and remember to adjust for politeness and
  formality based on the social context and relationships involved.
