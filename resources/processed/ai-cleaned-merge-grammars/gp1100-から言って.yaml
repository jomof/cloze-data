    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「から言って」 combines the particle 「から」 (from/since) and the te-form of the verb 「言う」 (いう - to say), literally meaning \"from saying.\" This linguistic construction implies that a judgment, conclusion, or statement is being drawn \"from\" or \"based on\" the preceding noun or situation. It functions similarly to English phrases like \"judging from\" or \"in terms of,\" providing the foundational perspective for the subsequent assertion.",
    "writeup": "「から言って」 is a versatile phrase used to introduce the basis for a judgment, evaluation, or conclusion. It establishes a viewpoint from which a statement is made, effectively meaning \"in terms of\" or \"judging from.\" This expression is particularly common in analytical discussions, formal reports, or situations where one needs to articulate a reason or perspective for a given outcome or opinion. It serves to clarify that the following statement is a logical inference derived from the specified preceding element.\n\nWhile 「から言って」 often appears in formal contexts, its usage can extend to more casual settings when expressing a strong personal judgment or observation, though it retains a somewhat evaluative tone. It is typically followed by a statement of fact, an opinion, or a prediction. The noun preceding 「から言って」 serves as the focal point or the criterion upon which the judgment is made.",
