        "part-of-speech": "phrase",

    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「から言って」 combines the particle 「から」 (from/since) and the te-form of the verb 「言う」 (いう - to say), literally meaning \"from saying.\" This linguistic construction implies that a judgment, conclusion, or statement is being drawn \"from\" or \"based on\" the preceding noun or situation. It functions similarly to English phrases like \"judging from\" or \"in terms of,\" providing the foundational perspective for the subsequent assertion.",
    "writeup": "「から言って」 is a versatile phrase used to introduce the basis for a judgment, evaluation, or conclusion. It establishes a viewpoint from which a statement is made, effectively meaning \"in terms of\" or \"judging from.\" This expression is particularly common in analytical discussions, formal reports, or situations where one needs to articulate a reason or perspective for a given outcome or opinion. It serves to clarify that the following statement is a logical inference derived from the specified preceding element.While 「から言って」 often appears in formal contexts, its usage can extend to more casual settings when expressing a strong personal judgment or observation, though it retains a somewhat evaluative tone. It is typically followed by a statement of fact, an opinion, or a prediction. The noun preceding 「から言って」 serves as the focal point or the criterion upon which the judgment is made.",

            "term": "からして",
            "meaning": "Judging from; based on; even from",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「からして」 often emphasizes a single, clear example as the basis for judgment, implying that if even this obvious thing is true, then other things must be true too. In contrast, 「から言って」 considers a more comprehensive viewpoint or a broader category as the basis for judgment."

            "term": "からすると",
            "meaning": "Judging from; going by",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While often interchangeable, 「からすると」 tends to imply a more objective observation or a direct inference from a specific piece of evidence. 「から言って」 can be used for a broader, more subjective evaluation or a stronger, more conclusive judgment based on a particular viewpoint."

        {
            "term": "という点で",
            "meaning": "In terms of; from the point of view of",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「という点で」 is generally more formal and academic than 「から言って」, often used in essays, presentations, or when stating a neutral point of discussion. 「から言って」 carries a stronger nuance of making an inference or judgment."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference among these expressions lies in the nuance of evaluation and the scope of the basis for judgment. While 「からして」 often singles out a representative element to make a point, 「から言って」 leverages a broader category or perspective for its judgment. 「からすると」 leans towards objective observation. Meanwhile, 「という点で」 provides a more academic and neutral way to frame a discussion point, unlike the inferential nature of 「から言って」.",

            "etymology": "The term 「ウケる」 (ukeru) for 'popular' or 'well-received' comes from the verb 「受ける」 (ukeru), meaning 'to receive' or 'to take.' In modern slang, it has evolved to mean 'to be accepted' or 'to be a hit,' reflecting something that is well-received by a particular group."

            "nuance": "The sentence uses 「に違いない」 (ni chigainai) and 「違いねえな」, expressing strong certainty based on the observed expression. The casual tone of the conversation between two female friends is conveyed through the simple sentence structure. The use of 「んだね」 softens the assertion slightly while still conveying certainty. 「違いねえな」 is a very casual, slightly masculine-leaning contraction of 「に違いないね」, often used for strong, somewhat rough assertions, but can be used by female speakers in very casual contexts.",
            "etymology": "The word 「表情」 (hyoujou) means 'expression' and is composed of 「表」 (hyou) meaning 'surface' or 'outside' and 「情」 (jou) meaning 'emotion' or 'feeling,' literally referring to emotions displayed on the surface."

            "etymology": "「牽引」 (kenin) meaning 'to lead' or 'to pull,' is a compound of 「牽」 (ken) 'to pull' and 「引」 (in) 'to draw' or 'to pull.' This gives it a sense of forcefully leading or drawing something forward, often used in business contexts for market leadership."
