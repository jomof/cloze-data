    two statements (formal)
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: formal
  usage-context: stiff
etymology: 「だが」 is a conjunction formed from 「だ」 (the plain form of the copula) and 「が」 (a conjunction
  indicating contrast). This formation implies its primary use after nouns and な-adjectives, which typically
  take 「だ」 in their plain predicate form.
writeup: |-
  「だが」 functions as a conjunction to express contrast or contradiction, similar to "but" or "however" in English. It is specifically formed from the plain copula 「だ」 and the conjunction 「が」. Therefore, its use is primarily restricted to connecting clauses where the preceding statement ends with a noun or a な-adjective in its plain form. It conveys a formal and direct opposition between two statements.

  Think of it as saying, "It is [X], but..." or "[X] is the case, but...". For example, if you say 「学生だが」, it implies "I am a student, but...". If the preceding clause ends with a verb or an い-adjective, the simple conjunction 「が」 (without 「だ」) is used instead.

  「だが」 provides a direct and sometimes abrupt contrast, often suitable for formal, literary, or argumentative contexts. In contemporary Japanese, it retains a somewhat stiff impression, particularly in spoken casual conversation. While it is less common to add 「ね」 after 「だが」 to soften its tone, it is sometimes seen in older or very formal contexts. For everyday casual conversation, alternatives like 「でも」 or 「だけど」 are far more common.
false_friends:
  - term: が (but)
    meaning: But, However
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「が」 can connect clauses and imply contrast, it is less formal than 「だが」. Crucially,
      「が」 attaches directly to plain verbs and い-adjectives (e.g., 食べるが, 暑いが), whereas 「だが」 specifically
      follows plain nouns and な-adjectives (e.g., 学生だが, 静かだが).
    grammar_point: が (but)
  - term: けど・だけど
    meaning: But, However
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「けど」 and 「だけど」 are casual equivalents of 「だが」, used in informal conversations. They are much
      less stiff and more commonly used in everyday speech across all parts of speech.
    grammar_point: けど・だけど (but・however)
  - term: ところが (unexpected contrast)
    meaning: Even so, However, Even though, But
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ところが」 often introduces an unexpected result or a situation that differs from what was expected.
      「だが」 simply contrasts two statements without necessarily implying surprise.
    grammar_point: ところが (unexpected contrast)
  - term: けれども (but・although)
    meaning: But, Although
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「けれども」 is a slightly more formal version of 「けど」. Like 「が」, it can introduce contrasting information
      for all parts of speech, but it's generally less direct and emphatic in its opposition than 「だが」.
    grammar_point: けれども (but・although)
  - term: それでも (even so)
    meaning: But still, And yet, Even so, Nevertheless
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「それでも」 implies that despite a previous statement or situation, something else is still true
      or will still happen. It adds a sense of persistence or resilience, which 「だが」 doesn't necessarily
      convey, focusing solely on direct opposition.
    grammar_point: それでも (even so)
  - term: しかしながら (however・nevertheless)
    meaning: However, Nevertheless, But
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「しかしながら」, while formal, tends to introduce a logical counter-argument or a point of transition
      in a formal discourse. 「だが」 often provides a more direct, sometimes abrupt, contradiction or opposition
      within a sentence or between short sentences, primarily after nouns/na-adjectives.
    grammar_point: しかしながら (however・nevertheless)
  - term: とはいえ (though)
    meaning: Although; even though; that being said; however; nevertheless.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とはいえ」 is used to concede a point before introducing a contrasting or qualifying statement,
      often implying 'having said that.' It acknowledges the preceding statement but then presents a different
      perspective, whereas 「だが」 simply states a direct contrast.
    grammar_point: とはいえ (though)
  - term: にもかかわらず (despite)
    meaning: Despite, in spite of, regardless, nevertheless
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にもかかわらず」 emphasizes that something occurred despite a certain condition or expectation, implying
      a stronger sense of counter-expectation than a simple contrast with 「だが」.
    grammar_point: にもかかわらず (despite)
  - term: ものの (although・but)
    meaning: Although, but, even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ものの」 signals a concession followed by a contrasting or unexpected outcome, it carries
      a more literary or formal tone and often implies a slight disappointment or gap between expectation
      and reality. 「だが」 is a more direct, less nuanced statement of contrast.
    grammar_point: ものの (although・but)
  - term: 但し・ただし (however・provided that)
    meaning: However; but; provided that; only
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ただし」 often introduces a condition, proviso, or exception to a previously stated rule or fact,
      rather than a direct contrast or contradiction between two main ideas, which is the primary function
      of 「だが」.
    grammar_point: 但し・ただし (however・provided that)
  - term: 一方 (on the one hand)
    meaning: While; on the one hand; in contrast; at the same time
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「一方」 is typically used to present two contrasting aspects, viewpoints, or ongoing situations.
      It emphasizes a side-by-side comparison, whereas 「だが」 introduces a direct counter-statement or opposition
      to the preceding clause.
    grammar_point: 一方 (on the one hand)
  - term: '<suggest>: しかし (however)'
    meaning: However; but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「だが」 and 「しかし」 convey contrast, 「しかし」 is generally more formal and can stand independently
      at the beginning of a sentence. 「だが」 often connects clauses more directly within a sentence, or
      is used to introduce a more direct, sometimes abrupt, contradiction, specifically after nouns/na-adjectives.
    grammar_point: '<suggest>: しかし (however)'
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「だが」 is a formal conjunction specifically
  used after plain nouns and な-adjectives. For casual speech, prefer 「けど」 or 「でも」. When you want to emphasize
  an unexpected result, 「ところが」 might be a better fit. If you need to convey persistence despite a previous
  fact, consider using 「それでも」. For logical flow or a slightly milder formal transition, 「しかしながら」 can be
  appropriate. And for acknowledging a point while introducing a new perspective, 「とはいえ」 is useful. If
  an event occurred despite a condition, 「にもかかわらず」 provides a stronger sense of counter-expectation. Lastly,
  when introducing a concession with a literary or slightly disappointed nuance, 「ものの」 is often used.
  When introducing a condition or exception, 「ただし」 is more appropriate. For presenting two contrasting
  aspects simultaneously, consider using 「一方」. While 「しかし」 is similar to 「だが」, it generally feels more
  detached and can initiate a new sentence with a strong contrast, and is also not restricted to nouns/na-adjectives.
examples:
  - english: She is a teacher, but she is always late.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 先生 {だ が}、いつ も 遅刻 する。
      - 彼女 は 先生 {だ が}、いつ も 遅刻 し ます。
      - 彼女 は 先生 {だ}。{だ が}、いつ も 遅刻 する。
    english_literally: As for her, she is a teacher, but always is late.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 先生 {な の に}、いつ も 遅刻 する。
        english: She is a teacher, even though she is always late.
        hint: 「なのに」 expresses a sense of unexpectedness or dissatisfaction; it implies 'even though' or
          'despite.' We're looking for a formal conjunction that simply states a direct contrast after
          a noun or na-adjective.
    scene: A parent is discussing a new teacher's punctuality with a fellow parent.
    register: formal
    setting: humorous
    nuance: The speaker uses 「だが」 to present a factual statement about someone's profession (先生) and then
      immediately introduce a contrasting, somewhat amusing habit (遅刻する). This formal conjunction adds
      a touch of detached observation to the comment. The sentence can also be split into two for stronger
      emphasis on the contrast.
  - english: I like fish, but my wife can't eat it.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 魚 が 好き {だ が}、妻 は 食べ られ ない。

        english: While I like fish, on the other hand, my wife can't eat it.
        hint: 「一方 で」 highlights two contrasting aspects or situations, often emphasizing a duality. We're
          looking for a formal conjunction that simply states a direct contrast after a noun or na-adjective.
    scene: A man is explaining dietary preferences to a dinner host at a formal gathering.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The male speaker uses 「だが」 to present a direct, factual contrast about his personal preference
      (魚が好き) versus his wife's dietary restriction (妻は食べられない). This direct construction is suitable for
      conveying practical information in a semi-formal setting. The politeness of the second clause can
      be adjusted (食べられません) or the sentence split.
  - english: Today is a holiday, but I have a lot of work.
    japanese:
      - 今日 は 休日 {だ が}、仕事 が たくさん ある。

      - 今日 は 休日 {だ}。{だ が}、仕事 が たくさん ある。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休日 {な の に}、仕事 が たくさん ある。
        english: Today is a holiday, even though I have a lot of work.
        hint: 「なのに」 expresses a sense of unexpectedness, disappointment, or irony. We're looking for a
          formal conjunction that simply states a direct contrast between two facts after a noun or na-adjective.
    scene: A student is lamenting his heavy workload to a friend during a national holiday.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Even in casual conversation, especially among male speakers, 「だが」 can be used to emphasize
      a strong, perhaps frustrating, contrast between an expectation (休日) and a reality (仕事がたくさんある). The
      speaker's tone conveys a sense of resigned disappointment. The second clause can be made polite
      or the sentence split for variation.
  - english: He is good at English, but he cannot speak Japanese.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 英語 が 上手 {だ が}、日本 語 は 話せ ない。

      - 彼 は 英語 が 上手 {だ}。{だ が}、日本 語 は 話せ ない。

          - 彼 は 英語 が 上手 です。{しかし}、日本 語 は 話せ ませ ん。
        english: He is good at English. However, he cannot speak Japanese.
        hint: 「しかし」 is a more formal conjunction that introduces a strong contrast or limitation, often
          used at the beginning of a sentence or clause. We're looking for a formal conjunction that smoothly
          introduces a contrasting fact within a sentence, specifically after a noun or na-adjective.
    scene: An international student is explaining a friend's language abilities to a mutual acquaintance.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Explaining factual information about someone's capabilities can use 「だが」 to present both a
      strength (英語が上手) and a limitation (日本語は話せない) in a neutral, objective manner. This direct tone is
      suitable for formal or semi-formal discourse. Variations can involve changing the politeness of
      the second clause or splitting the sentence.
  - english: That is a difficult problem, but you must not give up.
    japanese:
      - それ は 難しい 問題 {だ が}、諦め て は いけ ない。

      - それ は 難しい 問題 {だ}。{だ が}、諦め て は いけ ない。

        english: That is a difficult problem. Even so, you must not give up.
        hint: 「それでも」 means 'even so' or 'nevertheless,' implying that despite a previous condition, something
          still holds true or should happen. We're looking for a formal conjunction that directly links
          a challenging situation with a strong imperative, specifically after a noun or na-adjective.
    scene: A coach encourages a discouraged athlete who is struggling with a challenging task.
    register: formal
    setting: inspirational
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The male coach uses 「だが」 to acknowledge the difficulty of the problem (難しい問題) while immediately
      contrasting it with a strong imperative to persevere (諦めてはいけない). This formal, decisive tone is typical
      of guidance or encouragement from a figure in authority. The politeness of the second clause can
      be changed or the sentence split.
  - english: He is a serious person, but sometimes he makes jokes.
    japanese:

          after a noun or na-adjective.
    scene: Two friends are chatting about a mutual friend's new apartment.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The use of 「だが」 here contrasts a positive attribute (綺麗) with a perceived negative (シンプルすぎる).
      While 「だが」 is formal, it can be used for objective evaluation even in a casual context, giving the
      statement a more definitive feel. The politeness of the second clause can be changed or the sentence
      split.

          formal contrast using 「だが」 after a noun or na-adjective.
    scene: A product designer explaining their work to a client.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「だが」 effectively contrasts two qualities of the design, highlighting a positive aspect (機能的だ)
      that might not be immediately obvious from its simple appearance (シンプル). This is a common pattern
      in professional descriptions. Variations include changing the politeness of the second clause or
      splitting the sentence.

          noun or na-adjective without extra nuance.
    scene: A mentor giving advice to a protégé about a new venture.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: cautious
    nuance: The mentor uses 「だが」 to provide a realistic assessment, balancing the positive (良い機会) with
      the negative (リスクも伴う). The formal nature of 「だが」 lends weight to the advice. Variations include
      changing the politeness of the second clause or splitting the sentence.
post_example_writeup: These examples demonstrate how 「だが」 is employed to introduce a contrasting element
  specifically when the preceding clause ends with a noun or a な-adjective. The use of 「だが」 typically
  indicates a more direct or formal tone, aligning with the speaker's relationship to the listener and
  the context of the conversation. Note how the conjunction can sometimes initiate a new sentence for
  stronger emphasis on the contrast.
