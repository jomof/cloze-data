    "etymology": "The term 「あり」 originates from the literary form of the verb 「有る (ある)」, meaning 'to be' or 'to exist'. It functions similarly to 「なし (nashi)」, but instead of indicating the absence of something, it highlights the presence or possibility of something within a broader context. It is important to note that the kanji 「有り」 emphasizes 'inclusiveness as part of a whole', while the kanji 「在り」 focuses more on 'stand-alone existence'.",
    "writeup": "「あり」, while literally the literary form of 「有る」 ('to be'), functions in modern Japanese to indicate that something *is* an option or possibility. It suggests that the mentioned item or feature is present or could be considered among other options. It is similar to 「なし」, but with the opposite meaning; instead of indicating something is 'without (A)', it implies something is 'with (A)'.\n\n**Key Usage**:\n\n*   **Indicating Possibility**: Used to suggest something as a possible option. Often seen with 「～もいい」 or 「～じゃない」 patterns.\n*   **Describing Features**: Indicates that something has a particular feature or amenity. For example, 「駐車場あり」 means 'with parking'.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   The implication is always that it is one of multiple possibilities.\n*   The kanji 「有り」 indicates 'inclusiveness as part of a whole', while 「在り」 focuses more on 'stand-alone existence'.",
