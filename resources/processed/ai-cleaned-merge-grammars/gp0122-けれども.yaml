    "etymology": "けれども is derived from the verb 「蹴る (ける)」 (to kick) and the auxiliary verb 「ども」, originally expressing a sense of resistance or reservation. Over time, it evolved to its modern meaning of 'but' or 'although'. The 'も' adds a sense of inclusiveness or acceptance of the preceding statement.",
    "writeup": "**けれども** is a formal conjunctive particle similar to **けど**, meaning \"but\" or \"although\". It connects two sentences, indicating a contrast or exception. While interchangeable with **けど**, **けれども** conveys a more polite and literary tone. It emphasizes that while acknowledging the first clause (A), the second clause (B) is more important or requires consideration. It's more formal than **けど**, **けれど**, and **けども**, but less formal than **が**. だ is required when connecting a な-adjective or a noun to **けれども**.",
