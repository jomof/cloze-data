    "etymology": "けれども is derived from the verb 「蹴る (ける)」 (to kick) and the auxiliary verb 「ども」, originally expressing a sense of resistance or reservation. Over time, it evolved to its modern meaning of 'but' or 'although'. The 'も' adds a sense of inclusiveness or acceptance of the preceding statement.",
    "writeup": "けれども is a formal conjunctive particle that translates to \"but\" or \"although\". It connects two clauses, where the second clause often presents a contrast, an exception, or an additional piece of information that is significant or requires consideration, given the first clause. While broadly similar in meaning to けど, けれども carries a more formal, polite, and sometimes literary tone.\n\n**Formality Scale**:\nIn terms of formality, けれども stands in the middle of a spectrum of similar conjunctive particles. Generally, the order from most casual to most formal is:\nCasual -> けど -> けども -> けれど -> けれども -> が -> Formal.\n\n**Usage Notes**:\n*   When connecting けれども to a な-adjective stem or a noun, the copula だ is required before けれども (e.g., 静かだけれども, 学生だけれども).\n*   Similar to けど and other concessive conjunctions in Japanese, the clause following けれども can sometimes be omitted if the context makes it obvious, or if the speaker wishes to imply something without explicitly stating it. This can add a nuanced or reserved feel to the statement.\n\n**Historical Nuance**:\nHistorically, けれども was sometimes considered to carry a slightly more feminine nuance compared to が. However, in modern Japanese, especially with the widespread use of けど, this specific feminine nuance has largely faded, making けれども primarily distinguished by its formality rather than gender association.",
