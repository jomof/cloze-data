        "Usage": "Used to express that the speaker, or someone the speaker empathizes with, receives a benefit from an action performed by another person, where the doer's status is not higher than the recipient's."

    "etymology": "The grammar point もらう is derived from the verb もらう, which means \"to receive\". When used as an auxiliary verb, it retains the sense of receiving, but in the context of someone performing an action that benefits the speaker.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **もらう (morau)** is used to express that someone does something for the speaker's benefit. It's attached to the te-form of a verb (Vて + もらう). This grammar point implies that the speaker is receiving a favor or a benefit from someone else's action. It is important to remember that the person doing the action is typically of equal or lower status than the person who benefits. The related verbs are くれる (kureru), which indicates that someone does something for the speaker, and あげる (ageru), which indicates the speaker does something for someone else.",
