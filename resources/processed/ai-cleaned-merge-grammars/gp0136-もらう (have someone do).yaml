    "writeup": "**もらう** (morau) is used as an auxiliary verb with the て-form of another verb to indicate that the speaker, or someone closely associated with the speaker, receives a benefit from someone's action. It conveys the meaning of \"having someone do something for you\" or \"receiving a favor.\"  The person performing the action is usually of equal or lower status than the recipient. When using **もらう**, it's **important** to ensure that the subject is the one receiving the benefit. Consider it as 'I received the action of doing' from someone. **もらう** conjugates just like any other regular u-verb.",
