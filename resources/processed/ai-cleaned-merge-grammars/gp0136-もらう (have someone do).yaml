    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point もらう is derived from the verb もらう, which means \"to receive\". When used as an auxiliary verb, it retains the sense of receiving, but in the context of someone performing an action that benefits the speaker. Historically, the verb itself comes from 古典日本語 (Classical Japanese) 「まらう」 (marau), which had a similar meaning of receiving. The modern てもらう construction solidified over time to express this specific nuance of received favor.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **てもらう (te morau)** is used to express that someone does something for the speaker's benefit. It is attached to the te-form of a verb (Vて + もらう). This construction implies that the speaker is receiving a favor or a beneficial action from someone else.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that the person performing the action is typically of equal or lower status than the person who receives the benefit. This contrasts with polite request forms or honorifics, which typically involve higher-status individuals. While もらう can be used politely (e.g., もらいました), it still carries this underlying social relationship.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n*   **Beneficiary:** The primary beneficiary of the action is the speaker or someone within their inner circle (e.g., family, close friends). If the beneficiary is someone outside this group, other grammar structures like てあげる might be more appropriate.\n*   **Perspective:** The focus is on the recipient's perspective – the speaker acknowledges that they *received* a service or benefit.\n*   **Context:** It is widely used in daily conversation and business settings where a favor is exchanged or a service is rendered for one's benefit.\n\nUnderstanding the distinction between もらう, くれる, and あげる is fundamental. While もらう focuses on the speaker *receiving* a benefit, くれる emphasizes the giver's action of *giving* a benefit to the speaker, and あげる focuses on the speaker *giving* a benefit to someone else.",
