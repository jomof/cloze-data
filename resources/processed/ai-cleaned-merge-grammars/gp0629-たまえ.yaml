        "usage-context": "Primarily used by men addressing someone of lower status (e.g., boss to employee, teacher to student, older to younger). Can also appear in archaic or literary contexts for solemn requests or pleas.",
        "function": "To issue a mild order or request, or to express a solemn wish.",
        "nuance": "Carries an authoritative, sometimes slightly old-fashioned, male-centric tone. It is less harsh than a plain imperative (～ろ/～せよ) but more direct and less universally polite than ～てください.",
        "source": "Bunpro (historical derivation from 給う)"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たまえ」 originates from the verb 「給う」 (tamau), an honorific verb meaning \"to give\" or \"to bestow\". Over time, its imperative form evolved into a way to issue commands or requests, primarily from a superior to a subordinate.",
    "writeup": "The imperative form 「たまえ」 is derived from the classical verb 「給う」 (tamau), which means \"to give\" or \"to bestow\". When attached to the ます-stem of a verb, 「たまえ」 forms a command or a firm request. Although it can sometimes be translated as \"please do (A)\", it is crucial to understand its specific usage and nuance.\n\n**Usage Context and Register:**\n\n「たまえ」 is a highly formal and somewhat stiff expression. It is almost **exclusively used by men** when addressing someone of visibly lower status or rank. This hierarchical relationship is typically clear, such as a boss speaking to an employee, a teacher to a student, or an older man to a younger one. While it conveys a command, it is generally less harsh than the plain imperative form (e.g., 「～しろ」 or 「～せよ」) and maintains a certain level of traditional formality.\n\n**Historical and Literary Use:**\n\nHistorically, 「たまえ」 was also used in more solemn contexts, such as prayers or formal pleas to a higher power or a deity. In modern Japanese, this usage is largely confined to classical literature, religious texts, or dramatic performances, giving it an archaic or literary feel in such instances.",

            "nuance": "The plain imperative forms 「～しろ」 (for Godan verbs) and 「～せよ」 (for Suru verbs) are much harsher and more direct than 「たまえ」. While 「たまえ」 retains a degree of formality or traditional authority, 「～しろ/～せよ」 can sound rude or abrupt if not used in appropriate contexts (e.g., military commands, very angry speech)."
