        "usage-context": "Primarily used by men addressing someone of lower status (e.g., boss to employee, teacher to student, older to younger). Can also appear in archaic or literary contexts for solemn requests or pleas.",
        "function": "To issue a mild order or request, or to express a solemn wish.",
        "nuance": "Carries an authoritative, sometimes slightly old-fashioned, male-centric tone. It is less harsh than a plain imperative (～ろ/～せよ) but more direct and less universally polite than ～てください.",
        "source": "Bunpro (historical derivation from 給う)"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たまえ」 originates from the verb 「給う」 (tamau), an honorific verb meaning \"to give\" or \"to bestow\". Over time, its imperative form evolved into a way to issue commands or requests, primarily from a superior to a subordinate.",
    "writeup": "The imperative form 「たまえ」 is derived from the classical verb 「給う」 (tamau), which means \"to give\" or \"to bestow\". When attached to the ます-stem of a verb, 「たまえ」 forms a command or a firm request. Although it can sometimes be translated as \"please do (A)\", it is crucial to understand its specific usage and nuance.Usage Context and Register:「たまえ」 is a highly formal and somewhat stiff expression. It is almost **exclusively used by men** when addressing someone of visibly lower status or rank. This hierarchical relationship is typically clear, such as a boss speaking to an employee, a teacher to a student, or an older man to a younger one. While it conveys a command, it is generally less harsh than the plain imperative form (e.g., 「～しろ」 or 「～せよ」) and maintains a certain level of traditional formality.Historical and Literary Use:Historically, 「たまえ」 was also used in more solemn contexts, such as prayers or formal pleas to a higher power or a deity. In modern Japanese, this usage is largely confined to classical literature, religious texts, or dramatic performances, giving it an archaic or literary feel in such instances.",

            "nuance": "While both 「たまえ」 and 「～なさい」 are commands given by a superior to a subordinate, 「たまえ」 is generally more formal, often used by older men, and can carry a slightly more authoritative or traditional nuance. 「～なさい」 is generally softer and more common across genders and ages."

            "nuance": "The plain imperative forms 「～しろ」 (for Godan verbs) and 「～せよ」 (for Suru verbs) are much harsher and more direct than 「たまえ」. While 「たまえ」 retains a degree of formality or traditional authority, 「～しろ/～せよ」 can sound rude or abrupt if not used in appropriate contexts (e.g., military commands, very angry speech)."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When giving commands or making requests, it is important to choose the appropriate expression based on the speaker's gender, status relative to the listener, and the desired level of formality or directness. 「たまえ」 offers a distinct nuance of male-centric, authoritative instruction, contrasting with the softer 「～なさい」, the prohibitive 「な」, or the very direct 「～しろ/～せよ」.",

            "speaker_age": "older",
            "nuance": "The use of 「お入りたまえ」 by an older male executive to a junior employee indicates a polite but firm instruction, typical of male-centric superior-subordinate interactions. The phrase 「さあ まあ、どうぞ」 softens the command, making it sound more inviting than a direct order.",
            "etymology": "The honorific prefix 「お」 (o-) before 「入り」 (iri, entering) adds politeness, indicating respect for the action or the person to whom the action pertains, despite the commanding nature of 「たまえ」 itself. This combination is common in formal directions or invitations where both respect and clear instruction are needed. 「さあ まあ、どうぞ」 is an interjection used to gently urge or invite someone, often implying a slight pause or consideration before action, originating from a combination of the urging particle 「さあ」 and the softening particle 「まあ」, followed by the polite invitation 「どうぞ」 (please)."

            "nuance": "「述べたまえ」 is used by the male professor to encourage the student to speak their mind. While it's an imperative, the context implies an encouragement rather than a harsh command, reflecting the professor's role in guiding discussion.",
            "etymology": "「率直」 (socchoku) means 'frank' or 'candid', stemming from 「率」 (sotsu/ritsu, leading/rate) and 「直」 (choku/jiki, straight/direct). Its usage here highlights the desire for unadulterated truth. 「意見」 (iken) means 'opinion', formed from 「意」 (i, meaning/mind) and 「見」 (ken, view/look). The combination 「率直な意見」 is a common collocation to express a direct and honest viewpoint. The phrase 「～ようだな」 (you da na) implies 'it seems that ~', with 「よう」 indicating appearance or state, 「だ」 being the copula, and 「な」 acting as a sentence-final particle to express mild assertion or agreement-seeking, common in conversational Japanese to soften a direct statement or prompt a response. This combination of particles and verb forms creates a nuanced tone of observation followed by encouragement."

            "nuance": "Used by an older male host, 「飲みたまえ」 acts as a warm, authoritative invitation to drink, typical of a superior offering hospitality. The phrase 「遠慮せず」 (without holding back) further emphasizes the encouraging nature.",
            "etymology": "「遠慮」 (enryo) means 'reserve' or 'holding back', combining 「遠」 (en, far) and 「慮」 (ryo, consider/thought). The expression 「遠慮せず」 (enryo sezu) literally means 'without holding back consideration', urging the listener to act freely without hesitation. This phrase often appears in hospitality settings, as seen here. 「もっと」 (motto) means 'more', derived from an older form of 'to hold' or 'to possess', indicating an increase. Its use here reinforces the idea of encouraging the guest to take more. 「さあ」 is an interjection used to urge or prompt action, often with a sense of encouragement or invitation. This example's use of 「遠慮せず」 along with 「さあ」 and 「たまえ」 creates a strong, yet benevolent, push for the guest to feel comfortable and enjoy themselves. The classical particle 「ず」 at the end of 「遠慮せず」 (the negative form of a verb/adjective) is a remnant of classical Japanese and contributes to the slightly formal or literary feel of the expression."

            "etymology": "「主」 (shu) meaning 'Lord' or 'master' is often used in religious contexts to refer to a deity. The particle 「よ」 (yo) after 「主」 is a vocative particle, used to call out to someone or something, similar to 'O' or 'Thou' in archaic English. This usage is common in prayers, poetry, and classical texts. 「魂」 (tamashii) means 'soul' or 'spirit', often having spiritual or philosophical connotations. The verb 「救う」 (sukuu) means 'to save' or 'to rescue', and in this context, it refers to spiritual salvation. This example demonstrates 「たまえ」 in its most archaic and solemn usage, highlighting its historical role in formal entreaties to a higher power, far removed from everyday conversation."

            "nuance": "「取りかかりたまえ」 is a sharp, commanding imperative from an older male boss to a subordinate, suitable for expressing displeasure and demanding immediate action. The use of 「君」 (you) also underscores the direct and hierarchical address.",
            "etymology": "「君」 (kimi) is a second-person pronoun that implies a relationship of superiority (speaker to listener) or familiarity. In this context, it's used by a superior addressing a subordinate, reinforcing the hierarchical relationship. 「取りかかる」 (torikakaru) means 'to set about', 'to begin', or 'to start (work)', combining 「取る」 (toru, to take) and 「かかる」 (kakaru, to hang/to be about to do). The phrasing 「何をしている！」 (nani wo shite iru!) is an interrogative exclamation, literally 'What are you doing!', used to express strong disapproval or surprise at someone's actions. 「すぐに」 (sugu ni) means 'immediately' or 'right away', emphasizing the urgency of the command. This combination of direct address, rhetorical question, and an urgent command creates a very strong and authoritative tone typical of a strict boss."

            "etymology": "「宿題」 (shukudai) means 'homework', composed of 「宿」 (shuku, lodging/inn) and 「題」 (dai, topic/title), referring to a task given to be completed at one's 'lodging'. 「どうした」 (dou shita) is a casual phrase asking 'What happened?' or 'What did you do?', used here to inquire about the status of the homework. 「今すぐ」 (ima sugu) means 'right now' or 'immediately', with 「今」 (ima, now) and 「すぐ」 (sugu, immediately). The verb 「始める」 (hajimeru) means 'to begin' or 'to start'. The use of 「たまえ」 in this parent-child context lends a slightly old-fashioned or particularly stern tone, emphasizing the father's authority in a way that is less harsh than a plain imperative like 「始めろ」 but more firm than a polite request."

            "etymology": "「次の方」 (tsugi no kata) literally means 'the next person', where 「方」 (kata) is a polite and respectful term for 'person'. 「こちらへ」 (kochira e) means 'this way', with 「こちら」 (kochira) being the polite form of 「ここ」 (koko, here). 「お進み」 (osusumi) is the honorific form of the verb 「進む」 (susumu, to proceed/advance), indicating respect. The combined expression 「お進みたまえ」 is a formal and directive instruction often used in professional or service settings where clear, polite guidance is necessary, demonstrating the staff's authority while maintaining decorum. This reflects the nuance of 「たまえ」 being a formal command that can also be used in service contexts."

It is primarily used by male speakers and often conveys a sense of traditional authority or a benevolent but firm instruction.",
