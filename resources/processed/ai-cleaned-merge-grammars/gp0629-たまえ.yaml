    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たまえ」 originates from the verb 「給う」 (tamau), an honorific verb meaning \"to give\" or \"to bestow\". Over time, its imperative form evolved into a way to issue commands or requests, primarily from a superior to a subordinate.",
    "writeup": "The imperative form 「たまえ」 is derived from the verb 「給う」 (tamau), meaning \"to give\". Attaching 「たまえ」 to the ます-stem of a verb creates a mild order or request, often translated as \"please do (A)\". However, it's crucial to note that 「たまえ」 is **exclusively used by men** to address someone of lower status, emphasizing the power dynamic between the speaker and the listener, such as a boss and their subordinate. While it can be translated as \"please\", it's important to recognize the inherent bossy tone. In the past, 「たまえ」 was used in prayers to ask for favors, but this usage is now primarily found in older texts.",

            "nuance": "「座りたまえ」 is a mild command, but sounds welcoming in this context.",

            "listener_age": "younger",
            "nuance": "「言い」 is the ます-stem of the verb 「言う」, and 「たまえ」 is added to create a command. Because the speaker is a teacher and the listener is a student, it is natural for the teacher to use the 「たまえ」 command form.",
