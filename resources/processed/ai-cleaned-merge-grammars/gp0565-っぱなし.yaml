    "etymology": "The suffix 「っぱなし」 originally comes from the verb 「放す(はなす)」, meaning \"to let go\" or \"to release\". However, the nuance of 「っぱなし」 is closer to \"being unchecked\" or \"left unattended.\"",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「っぱなし」 is attached to the ます-stem of a verb to indicate that something has been left in a certain state, typically a negative or undesirable one. It conveys a sense that something is unchecked, continuing without intervention, or left undone. Although 「放す」 means \"to let loose,\" 「っぱなし」 suggests a lack of control or completion. It is almost exclusively used negatively to express feelings of annoyance or inconvenience at the state of something, such as 「電気をつけっぱなし」 (leaving the light on).",
