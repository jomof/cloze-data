    "etymology": "The suffix 「っぱなし」 originally comes from the verb 「放す (hanasu)」, which means \"to let go\" or \"to release\". However, 「っぱなし」 carries a nuance closer to \"being unchecked\" or \"left unattended\". Thus, it implies that something is continuing without anyone stopping it or that something is left in a certain state without being taken care of.",
    "writeup": "「っぱなし」 is a suffix attached to the ます-stem of verbs. While its etymology traces back to the verb 「放す (hanasu)」, meaning \"to let go\" or \"to release,\" its current usage often carries a strong connotation of **leaving something in an undesirable state** or an action continuing **unchecked**. This nuance implies a sense of negligence or a lack of attention to consequences. It can describe either an action that continues without stopping (e.g., talking non-stop) or a state that remains unchanged (e.g., leaving a door open), typically with a negative implication.",
