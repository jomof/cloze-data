        "part-of-speech": "auxiliary verb",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Used to express that an action or state continues without interruption, or that something has been left in a particular (often undesirable) state.",
        "function": "Suffix used to indicate continuity or neglect.",
        "nuance": "Implies a lack of care, oversight, or a prolonged, often problematic, state/action. It frequently carries a negative connotation, suggesting that the speaker disapproves of the unchecked continuation or the unattended state. While it can simply denote continuity, the underlying tone is usually one of mild complaint or observation of something that perhaps should not have been left as it is.",
        "source": "Derived from the verb '放す' (hanasu - to let go, release).",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a suffix modifying the preceding verb to describe a continuous or neglected state."
    },
    "etymology": "The suffix 「っぱなし」 originates from the verb 「放す (hanasu)」, meaning \"to let go\" or \"to release.\" However, its evolution has imbued it with a nuance closer to \"being unchecked\" or \"left unattended.\" This semantic shift highlights a continuous state or action that is either unintentional, prolonged beyond what is desirable, or indicative of negligence. Thus, 「っぱなし」 often conveys a sense of oversight or a lack of proper management regarding the state of an object or the continuation of an action.",
    "writeup": "「っぱなし」 is a suffix attached to the ます-stem of verbs. It describes a situation where an action continues without interruption, or where an object is left in a particular state without being attended to. The core nuance of 「っぱなし」 often carries a connotation of **negligence, oversight, or an undesirable prolonged state**. It suggests that something has been left undone or continues for too long, implying a lack of care or responsibility.\n\nThis grammar point can be used in two main ways:\n\n1.  **To describe a continuous action:** When attached to verbs indicating an action, 「っぱなし」 signifies that the action has been continuing without a break. For example, 「立ちっぱなし」 means \"kept standing\" or \"standing non-stop.\" This often implies discomfort or fatigue due to the continuous nature of the action.\n\n2.  **To describe an object left in a state:** When attached to verbs that describe leaving something in a certain state (like opening, turning on), 「っぱなし」 indicates that the item was left in that state and is still that way, often due to forgetfulness or carelessness. For example, 「電気をつけっぱなし」 means \"left the lights on,\" implying that they should have been turned off.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that while 「っぱなし」 denotes continuity or a state, it almost always carries a subtle or overt negative implication. This can range from mild disapproval to an outright complaint about the consequences of the unchecked state or action.",

            "meaning": "As is, while remaining, left in a state",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both 「っぱなし」 and 「まま」 can describe something left in a certain state, 「っぱなし」 typically carries a negative connotation of negligence, oversight, or an unchecked continuous action. In contrast, 「まま」 is generally neutral, simply stating that a state continues as it is, without implying carelessness or undesirable consequences."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「続ける」 simply indicates that an action continues. While 「っぱなし」 also indicates continuity, it adds the nuance of the action continuing *without interruption* or *without being stopped*, often implying it is unchecked, excessive, or has negative consequences. 「続ける」 is neutral and does not carry this negative implication."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between 「っぱなし」, 「まま」, and 「続ける」, consider the nuance you wish to convey. Use 「っぱなし」 if you want to highlight a lack of care, an oversight, or an excessive, unchecked continuation. Use 「まま」 for a neutral description of a continued state. Opt for 「続ける」 when you simply want to state that an action is ongoing without any particular judgment about its appropriateness or consequences.",
