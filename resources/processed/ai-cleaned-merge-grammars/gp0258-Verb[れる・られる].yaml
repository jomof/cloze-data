    "etymology": "The auxiliary verbs 「れる」 and 「られる」 originate from the classical Japanese verbs 「る」 and 「らる」, respectively, which indicated spontaneity or potential. Over time, their usage expanded to include passive and respectful meanings.",
    "writeup": "The Japanese passive voice, indicated by 「れる・られる」, expresses that the subject of the sentence is the recipient of an action. It's often used when something is done *to* someone, sometimes against their will or to their dismay. Think of it as a \"displacement verb\" where the focus is shifted to the one affected.\n\n*   **Conjugation is key:**\n    *   **う-verbs (godan):** Change the final 「う」 sound to its 「あ」 sound equivalent, then add 「れる」. For example, 「書く」(kaku - to write) becomes 「書かれる」(kakareru - to be written).\n    *   **る-verbs (ichidan):** Simply replace the 「る」 with 「られる」. For instance, 「食べる」(taberu - to eat) becomes 「食べられる」(taberareru - to be eaten).\n    *   **Irregular verbs:** 「する」 becomes 「される」, and 「くる」 becomes 「こられる」.\n*   **Marking the doer:** The person or thing performing the action is typically marked with 「に」. 「から」 can also be used when there is no direct physical contact.\n\nIt's important to note that 「られる」 has multiple uses, including:\n\n*   **Passive (受け身):** Something is done to the subject by an external force.\n*   **Potential (可能):** Expressing the ability to do something.  (This is often shortened to just 「れる」.)\n*   **Spontaneous (自発):** Something happens on its own.\n*   **Respectful (尊敬):** Showing respect by making someone the subject of the sentence, even if they're not the one performing the action.\n\n**ラ抜き言葉 (ra-nuki kotoba):** Dropping the 「ら」 from 「られる」 is common, especially when indicating potential. However, avoid dropping 「ら」 when expressing passive, spontaneous, or respectful meanings.",
