        "usage-context": "General"
    },
    "etymology": "The auxiliary verbs 「れる」 and 「られる」 originate from the classical Japanese verbs 「る」 and 「らる」, respectively, which indicated spontaneity or potential. Over time, their usage expanded to include passive and respectful meanings.",
    "writeup": "The Japanese passive voice, indicated by 「れる・られる」, expresses that the subject of the sentence is the recipient of an action. It's often used when something is done *to* someone, sometimes against their will or to their dismay. Think of it as a \"displacement verb\" where the focus is shifted to the one affected.\n\nTraditionally, many textbooks use the term 'passive' because there is no direct equivalent verb type in English. However, we can also view these as \"displacement verbs,\" where the focus is shifted to the recipient of the action, similar to how keigo (polite speech) might function by elevating the subject.\n\n**Conjugation is key:**\n*   **う-verbs (godan):** Change the final 「う」 sound to its 「あ」 sound equivalent, then add 「れる」. For example, 「書く」(kaku - to write) becomes 「書かれる」(kakareru - to be written).\n*   **る-verbs (ichidan):** Simply replace the 「る」 with 「られる」. For instance, 「食べる」(taberu - to eat) becomes 「食べられる」(taberareru - to be eaten).\n*   **Irregular verbs:** 「する」 becomes 「される」, and 「くる」 becomes 「こられる」.\n\n**Marking the doer:** The person or thing performing the action is typically marked with 「に」. 「から」 can also be used when there is no direct physical contact or source.\n\nIt's important to note that 「られる」 (and its 「れる」 counterpart) has multiple uses, extending beyond just passive voice:\n\n*   **Passive (受け身):** Something happens to the subject as a result of an external force. This often carries a negative nuance, implying an action that was done *to* the subject, sometimes against their will or to their detriment. For example, 「雨に降られる」(ame ni furareru - to be rained on) expresses inconvenience.\n*   **Potential (可能):** Expressing the ability to do something. For example, 「日本語が話せる」(nihongo ga hanaseru - to be able to speak Japanese). This is particularly common, and often the 「ら」 is dropped for る-verbs, resulting in the 「ら抜き言葉」(ra-nuki kotoba).\n*   **Spontaneous (自発):** Something happens by itself, or \"without instigation,\" often used with verbs related to emotion, thought, or perception. For example, 「故郷が思い出される」(kokyou ga omoidasareru - my hometown comes to mind).\n*   **Respectful (尊敬):** Showing respect by making someone the subject of the sentence, even if they're not the one performing the action. This is frequently seen in keigo. For example, 「先生が来られる」(sensei ga korareru - the teacher comes/arrives).\n\n**ら抜き言葉 (ra-nuki kotoba):** Dropping the 「ら」 from 「られる」 (e.g., 食べられる -> 食べれる) is very common, especially when indicating potential. However, this informal usage is typically avoided in formal writing or speech. The standard rules are as follows:\n*   **「ら」 may be removed:** For る-verbs and 「くる」, when the meaning is 'potential' (e.g., 寝られる -> 寝れる).\n*   **「ら」 may not be removed:** For る-verbs and 「くる」, when the meaning is 'passive', 'spontaneous', or 'respectful'.\n\nTherefore, while 「寝れる」 and 「寝られる」 might both convey potential, 「寝られます」 in a polite context would also convey potential, but 「寝られます」 in a passive context would strictly adhere to the full form.",
