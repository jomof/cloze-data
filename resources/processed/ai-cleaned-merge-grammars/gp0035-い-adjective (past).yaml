    },
    "etymology": "The past tense form of い-adjectives is created by conjugating the adjective stem (removing the final い) and adding 「かった」. This 「かった」 is the past tense form of the auxiliary verb 「ある」, which used to be more directly involved in forming the past tense of adjectives. Over time, it became integrated into the adjective itself.",
    "writeup": "To express the past tense of い-adjectives, you conjugate the adjective by removing the final 「い」 and adding 「かった」. This is equivalent to \"was\" or \"were\" in English. To form the polite past tense, add 「です」 after 「かった」. While this polite form is widely accepted and common in modern speech, some purists may consider it less \"academically correct\" than other forms of politeness. Nevertheless, its usage is very prevalent.\nThe negative past form is created by changing the い-adjective to its negative form (e.g., 「～くない」) and then conjugating the 「ない」 ending to its past form 「なかった」, resulting in 「～くなかった」. A more formal polite negative past can be formed using 「～くありませんでした」.",
