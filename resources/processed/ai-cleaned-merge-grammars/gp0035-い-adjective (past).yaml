    "etymology": "The past tense form of い-adjectives is created by conjugating the adjective stem (removing the final い) and adding 「かった」. This 「かった」 is the past tense form of the auxiliary verb 「ある」, which used to be more directly involved in forming the past tense of adjectives. Over time, it became integrated into the adjective itself.",
    "writeup": "To express the past tense of い-adjectives, you conjugate the adjective by removing the final 「い」 and adding 「かった」. This is equivalent to \"was\" or \"were\" in English. To form the polite past tense, add 「です」 after 「かった」. The negative past form is created by changing the い-adjective to its negative form (くありません) and then conjugating the 「ない」 ending to its past form (なかった).",

        "violation: Corrected conjugation for example 'あの宿題、本当に難し{くなかった} よね？' from 'past (plain)' to 'negative past (plain)' as the form 'くなかった' is a negative past form. (Rule 6: 'Each example must use the grammar_point, though it may be in conjugated form.')",
        "violation: Removed 'speaker_gender' and 'listener_gender' from example 'あの宿題、本当に難し{くなかった} よね？' because the nuance for 'よね' did not strictly meet the requirement of being 'only' spoken by a specific gender at the N5 level. (Rule 6: 'If there is a \"speaker_gender\", then \"nuance\" must mention the specific Japanese, in 「quotes」, that would only be spoken by that gender.')",
        "violation: Added a new example '彼の話は面白{くありませんでした}。' to ensure that the 'くありませんでした' conjugation of the negative past polite form is explicitly shown, thereby diversifying the conjugations used in examples. (Rule 6: 'Please include example sentences with a variety of conjugations, especially the ones encountered in common usage.')",
        "violation: Added a new example '昨日はとても暑{かった}。' to explicitly provide a simple, casual 'past (plain)' form example, as the original first example was 'past (polite)'. (Rule 6: 'Example sentences should use the grammar_point, though it may be in conjugated form.')",
