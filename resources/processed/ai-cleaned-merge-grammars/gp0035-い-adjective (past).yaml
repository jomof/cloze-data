    "etymology": "The past tense of い-adjectives is formed by changing the い ending to かった. This 'かっ' is related to the past tense auxiliary verb た, indicating that the state or quality described by the adjective existed in the past.",
    "writeup": "To create the past form of い-adjectives, you must add the auxiliary verb 「た」 to the past conjunction form of the い-adjective. The past conjunction form is created by removing the い and replacing it with 「かっ」. This structure is equivalent to \"was\" or \"were\" in English.\n\nFor example:\n\n*   「面白い」 - \"Interesting\" in its base (dictionary) form.\n*   「面白かった」 - The past form of 「面白い」.\n\nFrom these examples, we can see how the casual past form is constructed. In modern Japanese, adding 「です」 after 「かった」 is considered a standard polite past form.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Although considered polite by many, using 「です」 after 「かった」 is not academically correct Japanese. However, its usage has become so common that it can be used confidently in almost any situation. A more formal way of conjugating い-adjectives in the past polite form is 「～くありませんでした」.",
