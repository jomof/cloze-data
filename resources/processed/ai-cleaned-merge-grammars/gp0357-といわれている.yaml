    "etymology": "「といわれている」 is derived from the verb 「言う(いう)」 (to say) in its passive form 「言われる(いわれる)」, combined with 「と」 indicating the content of what is said, and 「いる」 indicating a state or condition. Thus, it literally means 'is in the state of being said'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「といわれている」 translates to \"it is said that (A)\" or \"it is known that (A).\" It's used to express a commonly held or public opinion. The verb 「言う(いう)」, meaning \"to say,\" is used in its passive form. This grammar point expresses a 'quotation' or commonly heard statement.\n\nTo use 「といわれている」, attach it to the end of a phrase representing something commonly said. This grammar point is often seen with or without the kanji for 「言う」, as the meaning remains the same.",
