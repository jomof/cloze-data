jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Often used when talking about progress, learning, or change that happens in small, manageable
    portions.
  function: Expresses gradual, incremental progression.
  nuance: Emphasizes small, discrete steps rather than a continuous flow. Can convey diligence or patience.
etymology: The term 少しずつ is formed by combining 少し (sukoshi), an adverb meaning 'a little' or 'a few',
  with the particle ずつ (zutsu). ずつ is a distributive particle that indicates 'each', 'at a time', or 'in
  portions'. Therefore, 少しずつ literally means 'a little bit each time' or 'a little bit by little bit',
  emphasizing the incremental nature of an action or change.
writeup: The expression 少しずつ (sukoshizutsu) is an adverbial phrase used to describe actions or changes
  that occur in small, incremental steps over time. It literally combines 少し (sukoshi), meaning 'a little,'
  with the distributive particle ずつ (zutsu), which conveys the idea of 'each' or 'at a time.' This gives
  少しずつ the core meaning of 'little by little' or 'a bit at a time.'It emphasizes the **incremental nature**
  of a process. Unlike だんだん (dandan) or 徐々に (jojoni), which simply describe a gradual change, 少しずつ specifically
  highlights that the change is happening in *small, discrete portions*. This nuance can convey a sense
  of diligence, patience, or a manageable progression. For instance, when learning a new skill, one typically
  improves 少しずつ, meaning each practice session contributes a small amount to the overall improvement.少しずつ
  can modify verbs, indicating that an action is performed gradually, or it can modify adjectives, indicating
  a state that changes incrementally. It is commonly used in both casual and formal contexts, making it
  a versatile and frequently encountered expression in Japanese.

  - term: だんだん
    meaning: gradually
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: だんだん implies a continuous, smooth progression or change in degree, without necessarily emphasizing
      small, discrete increments. 少しずつ highlights the incremental, step-by-step nature.
    grammar_point: だんだん (gradually)
  - term: 徐々に
    meaning: gradually, slowly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 徐々に is more formal than だんだん and 少しずつ. It also describes a smooth, continuous, and often slow
      progression, similar to だんだん, but with a more formal tone. 少しずつ retains its emphasis on small, distinct
      steps.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:徐々に (gradually)
  - term: 少し
    meaning: a little, a few
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 少し simply means 'a little' or 'a small amount.' It does not carry the meaning of incrementation
      or distribution that ずつ adds. 少しずつ means 'a little *at a time*.'
    grammar_point: 少し (a little)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 少しずつ (sukoshizutsu) conveys a gradual process, it specifically emphasizes
  that the change or action happens in **small, discrete steps**. This is a key difference from similar
  terms like だんだん (dandan) and 徐々に (jojoni).だんだん (dandan) describes a general, continuous **gradual change**
  or progression. Think of it as a smooth increase or decrease in something. For example, 「だんだん 寒くなる」
  (It's gradually getting colder) describes a continuous change in temperature.徐々に (jojoni) also means
  'gradually' or 'slowly,' similar to だんだん, but it carries a **more formal** tone. It's often used in
  written language or formal speeches. Like だんだん, it doesn't emphasize discrete steps as much as 少しずつ
  does.Finally, 少し (sukoshi) simply means 'a little' or 'a small amount.' It refers to quantity or degree
  at a single point in time, not a process of incrementation. For example, 「少し 食べる」 (Eat a little) means
  eating a small amount at once, whereas 「少しずつ 食べる」 (Eat little by little) means eating small portions
  over time.
