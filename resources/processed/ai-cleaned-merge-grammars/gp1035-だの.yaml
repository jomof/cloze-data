    "writeup": "だの is used to list examples in a non-exhaustive way, similar to など or とか. It presents **at least two** examples, each followed by だの. The examples often represent opposites or share a negative trait. It can follow verbs, い-adjectives, nouns, or quotations. だの expresses the speaker's frustration or boredom with the mentioned items or the broader category they represent. Using だの implies a range of possibilities, which can emphasize either the diversity or the shared undesirability of the listed examples.",
