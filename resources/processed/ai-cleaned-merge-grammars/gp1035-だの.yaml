It implies \"and things like (A)\" or \"(A) and whatnot.\" It's used when giving at least two examples, each followed by 「だの」. These examples are often opposites or share a negative trait.\n\nIt can follow verbs, い-adjectives, nouns, or quotations.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   When the listed items are opposites, 「だの」 indicates a wide range to which a rule applies.\n*   When the listed items are similar, it expresses undesirable aspects within a specific category.\n*   Overall, 「だの」 emphasizes the speaker's frustration or boredom regarding things falling under that category or scope.",
