    "etymology": "The particle 「だの」 originates from a combination of the auxiliary verb 「だ」 (a form of 「です」) and the case-marking particle 「の」. Over time, it has evolved into a standalone adverbial particle.",
    "writeup": "「だの」 is used to present a list of examples, similar to 「など」 and 「とか」. It implies \"and things like (A)\" or \"(A) and whatnot.\" It's used when giving at least two examples, each followed by 「だの」. These examples are often opposites or share a negative trait.\n\nIt can follow verbs, い-adjectives, nouns, or quotations.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   When the listed items are opposites, 「だの」 indicates a wide range to which a rule applies.\n*   When the listed items are similar, it expresses undesirable aspects within a specific category.\n*   Overall, 「だの」 emphasizes the speaker's frustration or boredom regarding things falling under that category or scope.",
