  part-of-speech: particle
  register: formal
  particle-syntactic-function: case-marking
  particle-pragmatic-function: focus
  usage-context: Primarily used in writing and formal announcements; less common in casual conversation.
    Often appears in official documents, public signs, and formal business communication.
  function: Marks location, time, means, or agent in a formal or literary tone.
  nuance: Conveys formality, precision, and sometimes a slightly archaic or literary feel, distinct from
    the more casual 「で」 or general 「に」.
  colocation: Frequently used with nouns denoting places, specific times, instruments, or agents in formal
    contexts. Common in set phrases like 「これにて」 (with this, hereby).
etymology: 「にて」 originated from 「に」 (a particle indicating location, time, etc.) combined with 「て」 (the
  conjunctive particle). Over time, 「にて」 evolved into a standalone particle with a formal nuance similar
  to 「で」. Its historical use emphasized a precise point or means, which is why it retains a strong sense
  of 'at', 'in', or 'by means of' in formal settings today.
writeup: 「にて」 is a particle used to indicate location, time, means, or agent, primarily in formal or written
  contexts. It functions as a more formal equivalent of the common particle 「で」 and, in some cases, can
  overlap with certain uses of 「に」. While 「で」 is widely used in everyday conversation and writing, 「にて」
  elevates the tone, making sentences sound more official, dignified, or even archaic. It is commonly
  encountered in formal announcements, public signage, legal documents, business correspondence, and literary
  works. Using 「にて」 in casual conversation would sound unnatural and overly stiff.When indicating **location**,
  「にて」 specifies the exact place where an action occurs, similar to 「で」, but with a heightened sense of
  formality, suitable for an event venue or a specific spot for an activity. For **time**, it marks a
  precise point or period, often for official deadlines or event timings.For **means or method**, 「にて」
  expresses what is used to accomplish something, much like 「で」, but again, with a formal touch. This
  can include instruments, modes of transport, or even conceptual means. In certain contexts, it can also
  denote the **agent** of an action, particularly in formal or polite expressions, often replacing 「が」
  or 「によって」 to imply responsibility or formality.It is crucial to reserve 「にて」 for appropriate situations
  to maintain a natural-sounding Japanese. Its primary domain is formal communication where precision
  and a respectful tone are desired.

    nuance: 「で」 is less formal and more commonly used in everyday conversation. Use 「にて」 in formal or
      written contexts for a more elevated tone.
    grammar_point: で (at)
  - term: に (fixed point・target・time)
    meaning: in, at, to, for, on
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「に」 is a general-purpose particle that can indicate location, time, and direction. 「にて」 is
      more specific and formal, often implying 'by means of' or 'through' in a more defined manner than
      the general directional/locative 'に'.
    grammar_point: に (fixed point・target・time)
  - term: において・における (formal context)
    meaning: In, on, at, regarding, in terms of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「において」 and 「における」 are used to specify a context or scope, often translated as "in the context
      of" or "in the realm of." 「にて」 indicates a precise place, time, means, or agent, but it does not
      introduce a broader topic or general context. 「において」 focuses on the environment or field where something
      happens, while 「にて」 focuses on the specific point or means of the action.
    grammar_point: において・における (formal context)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate 「にて」 from similar particles, remember that 「にて」 primarily
  serves as a formal substitute for 「で」, indicating a specific point in time, location, or means. It adds
  a sophisticated and often official nuance. Therefore, it is best reserved for written contexts, public
  announcements, and very formal speech. In contrast, 「において」 and 「における」, while also formal, introduce
  a broader topic or specify a context or scope, making them unsuitable for simply marking a direct location,
  time, or means of action. Think of 「にて」 as pinpointing, whereas 「において」 sets the stage.
examples:
  - english: Today, the facility will close at 6 PM.
    japanese:
      - 本日、午後 六 時 {にて} 閉館 いたし ます。

        english: Today, the facility will close at 6 PM.
        hint: Both 「にて」 and 「で」 can indicate time. 「にて」 adds a higher degree of formality, often used
          in official announcements. We're looking for a formal announcement, signaling important information.
    scene: A public announcement at a museum or public facility regarding its operating hours.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「にて」 in this context is appropriate for formal announcements or written notices,
      emphasizing the official nature of the closing time. It provides a concise and clear statement,
      typical of public information displays or broadcasts.
    etymology: In this usage, 「にて」 retains its sense of a precise point in time, much like 'at' in English,
      but with added formality characteristic of public information. Its directness, even in formality,
      marks an exact moment for an event, rather than a general period. This application is often found
      in official signs and schedules, highlighting its role in conveying definitive information for a
      broad audience. It is chosen for its clear, unambiguous, and polite delivery, ensuring that important
      operational details are communicated with due respect and authority. This echoes the particle's
      origins in emphasizing specific points or means.

        english: Please submit complaints in writing.
        hint: 「にて」 indicates the means or method in a formal context, while 「で」 is its more common, everyday
          counterpart. We're looking for the more formal option here, suitable for official instructions.
    scene: An office policy instruction regarding the proper procedure for submitting a complaint.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: Here, 「にて」 clarifies the **method** or **means** of submission (書面 - in writing), conveying
      a formal instruction, common in official documents or business settings. It emphasizes the specific,
      prescribed way in which the action should be performed. This choice of particle underscores the
      seriousness and official nature of the process, ensuring compliance with established protocols.
    etymology: This usage of 「にて」 reflects its function as a formal equivalent to 「で」 when indicating
      the means by which an action is performed, particularly in administrative or procedural contexts.
      Its adoption in such scenarios emphasizes the gravity and official nature of the communicated instruction.
      It implies that the specified method is not merely one option, but often the designated or preferred
      way, reinforcing adherence to a formal process. This formality stems from its historical role in
      precisely delineating instruments or methods.

        english: The next meeting will be held in the main conference room at headquarters.
        hint: Both 「にて」 and 「で」 can indicate a location where an action takes place. 「にて」 is used in more
          formal settings like official announcements or documents. We're looking for formal language,
          appropriate for a corporate memo.
    scene: An internal company memo or announcement about an upcoming important meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Similar to its use for time, 「にて」 marks the **location** of an event (大 会議 室 - main conference
      room) in a formal, official manner, typical for corporate announcements. It clearly identifies the
      precise venue for an important gathering. This formal designation is common in official corporate
      communications, where exact details and a respectful tone are paramount. It leaves no room for ambiguity
      regarding the meeting's setting.
    etymology: The use of 「にて」 for location in formal settings mirrors its historical development as a
      more dignified alternative to 「で」, suitable for official declarations and significant events. Its
      precision in marking a specific place, combined with its formal register, makes it a preferred choice
      for conveying important logistical information in corporate and official contexts. This precision
      is a carryover from its role in marking exact points or means.

        english: The new store will have its grand opening on the first of next month.
        hint: While 「に」 is the common particle for specific time points, 「にて」 adds a formal, almost ceremonial
          tone when indicating a date for a significant event. We're looking for a formal announcement,
          fitting a grand opening.
    scene: A formal business announcement regarding the opening of a new retail location.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This usage of 「にて」 indicates a specific **time point** for a formal event (来月 一 日 - the first
      of next month), elevating the tone of the announcement. It transforms a simple date into a formal
      pronouncement, emphasizing the significance and official nature of the grand opening. This is often
      seen in press releases or public notices for major corporate milestones.
    etymology: This application of 「にて」 for specific dates or events in a formal announcement emphasizes
      its role in conveying precise and official timing, stemming from its direct and definitive nature.
      The formality here serves to underscore the importance and public nature of the event. It reflects
      a usage pattern where the particle signals a clear and established date for a significant occurrence,
      a characteristic derived from its historical emphasis on exactitude and formality.

          - 授賞 式 は 都内 の ホテル {で} 盛大 に 執り行わ れ ます。
        english: The awards ceremony will be grandly held at a hotel in the city.
        hint: 「にて」 emphasizes the location in a formal context, often used for important events or public
          statements, whereas 「で」 is the general particle for location of an action. We're looking for
          a formal description suitable for a news report.
    scene: A news report describing a prestigious event.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: In news reporting or formal descriptions, 「にて」 specifies the **location** (都内 の ホテル - a hotel
      in the city) where a significant event is held, lending gravity to the statement. This choice of
      particle enhances the official and respectful tone, making the description suitable for formal media
      announcements or public records. It underlines the importance of the venue for a noteworthy ceremony.
    etymology: This emphasizes 「にて」 as a formal marker for location, often chosen in public or broadcast
      contexts to maintain an air of professionalism and seriousness. Its usage in such descriptive scenarios
      highlights its ability to impart a sense of importance and precision to the stated location, reflecting
      a historical preference for formal clarity in official communications. This deliberate choice aims
      to convey that the setting is noteworthy and officially designated, aligning with the particle's

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ご 質問 は 担当 者 {が} お 受け いたし ます。
        english: The person in charge will receive your questions.
        hint: While 「にて」 indicates the means or agent in a formal way, using 「が」 would make the person
          in charge the direct subject, which is also grammatically correct but slightly changes the focus
          to the actor rather than the means by which the questions are received. Choose 「にて」 to maintain
          a polite, formal distance often used in customer service.
    scene: A customer service desk giving instructions on where to direct inquiries.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    nuance: Here, 「にて」 indicates the **agent** or **party** responsible for an action (担当 者 - the person
      in charge), used in polite or formal customer service interactions. It subtly emphasizes the procedural
      aspect of the inquiry handling rather than the individual's direct action. This construction is
      common in business communication to denote responsibility in a respectful and formal manner, suitable
      for interactions where clear roles are defined. It conveys an impersonal politeness, focusing on
      the system rather than individual initiative.
    etymology: This usage highlights 「にて」 as a formal means of attributing responsibility or agency, fitting
      for respectful and clear communication in service-oriented contexts. It reflects a historical shift
      in which the particle, originally marking means or location, expanded to formally denote the actor
      or medium through which an action is facilitated. This nuanced application allows for a polite distancing,
      making the interaction feel more organized and professional, rather than assigning direct, personal
      agency to the individual. The choice emphasizes the designated role rather than the person's inherent
      will or capability.
  - english: With this, today's agenda will be concluded.
    japanese:
      - これ {にて} 本日 の 議事 は 終了 と さ せ て いただき ます。

    english_literally: This by, today's agenda will be concluded.

          - これ {で} 本日 の 議事 は 終了 と さ せ て いただき ます。
        english: With this, today's agenda will be concluded.
        hint: 「これにて」 is a very formal fixed phrase to signal a conclusion, commonly found in official
          settings. 「これで」 is its everyday, less formal equivalent. We're looking for the formal phrasing
          used in official proceedings, befitting a formal closing statement.
    scene: A chairperson closing a formal meeting, signaling the end of discussions.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The fixed phrase 「これにて」 is a highly formal and definitive way to declare the **conclusion**
      of an event or discussion, typical in official proceedings. It carries a sense of finality and solemnity,
      suitable for formal announcements like the closing of a meeting or ceremony. This phrase elevates
      the simple act of concluding into a formal declaration, reinforcing the gravity of the proceedings.
    etymology: 「これにて」 is an example of 'にて' forming a set phrase, where its formal connotation is reinforced
      to clearly mark an ending, drawing from its role in marking precise points or means. The phrase
      captures the essence of a definitive closure, reflecting historical usage in formal pronouncements
      or the conclusion of official events. The inherent precision and formality of 「にて」 are amplified
      in this fixed expression, ensuring that the ending is perceived as official and conclusive, consistent
      with the particle's historical development.
  - english: Upon receiving news of his passing, I am overwhelmed with grief.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 訃報 に 接し、我が輩 は 悲嘆 {にて} 打ちひしが れ て いる。

          - 彼 の 訃報 に 接し、我が輩 は 悲嘆 {で} 打ちひしが れ て いる。
        english: Upon receiving news of his passing, I am overwhelmed with grief.
        hint: While 「悲嘆で」 is grammatically correct for 'by grief,' 「悲嘆にて」 elevates the expression to a
          more literary and dramatic tone, fitting the solemnity and archaic style of 「我が輩」. This construction
          is used to heighten emotional expression in a refined, traditional manner.
    scene: An elderly, dignified man lamenting a loss in a literary or dramatic fashion, expressing profound
      sorrow.
    register: bungo (literary)
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「我が輩」 (wagahai) is a very archaic and literary first-person pronoun, typically
      used by older men or in a self-important, dramatic context. Combining this with 「悲嘆にて」 (hitan nite)
      further elevates the formal and almost poetic nature of the expression, creating a sense of profound
      and measured sorrow characteristic of a male speaker of an older generation. This phrase paints
      a vivid picture of a dignified, traditional male expressing deep, almost classical, grief. The combination
      of these elements creates a unique, somber, and deeply reflective tone that emphasizes a male speaker's
      deep emotional response in a very traditional and refined manner. This distinguishes it from more
      common, less formal expressions of sadness.
    etymology: This usage of 'にて' is an older, literary application, functioning like 'by means of' or
      'with' but with a more dramatic or emotional weight, common in classic literature. Its role here
      is to express the instrument or cause of an intense emotional state, enhancing the descriptive power
      and formality of the sentence. This literary flourish emphasizes the profound impact of the news,
      aligning with the particle's historical role in marking a precise means or state, now applied to
      an internal, emotional condition. It showcases the particle's versatility in conveying not just
      physical means, but also abstract or emotional forces, particularly in elevated prose.
  - english: She wrote beautiful characters with a fountain pen.

        english: She wrote beautiful characters with a fountain pen.
        hint: Both 「にて」 and 「で」 can indicate the instrument used. 「にて」, in this context, adds a touch
          of formality and elegance, fitting the description of 'beautiful characters' written with a
          refined tool. We're looking for a graceful and precise tone, suggesting a delicate action.
    scene: Describing a refined person's action of writing, emphasizing elegance and precision.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: While 「にて」 is generally formal, when describing an action like writing 「美しい文字」 (utsukushii
      moji) with an elegant tool like 「万年筆」 (mannenhitsu), it evokes a sense of grace and precision. This
      phrasing can subtly suggest a refined or artistic sensibility, often associated with a female speaker
      or the subject of discussion. The use of 「にて」 here emphasizes the specific instrument and the deliberate,
      meticulous nature of the writing process, conveying a sense of care and artistry. This refined usage
      contributes to an image of cultured female expression, making the sentence more evocative than a
      simple statement using 「で」.
    etymology: This particular usage of 'にて' for an instrument or means, especially in conjunction with
      an elegant action like writing, reinforces its formal and precise nature, highlighting the specific
      tool used. It connects the action directly and formally to the instrument, signifying that the fountain
      pen is the specific means through which the beautiful characters were created. This precision is
      a hallmark of 「にて」, reflecting its long-standing role in designating the exact method or tool for
      an action, particularly in contexts that require a degree of formality or refinement.

        english: This report was compiled based on extensive research.
        hint: 「にて」 indicates the method or basis in a formal context, emphasizing the rigor of the research.
          「で」 is less formal and more common in everyday situations. We're looking for a formal, authoritative
          tone appropriate for a professional presentation.
    scene: A formal presentation of a research report to a board of directors or academic committee.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Using 「にて」 to describe the means of compilation for a report (広範 な 調査 - extensive research)
      lends a highly formal and professional tone, signifying a document of significant academic or business
      value. This choice emphasizes the rigorous and systematic nature of the research process. It is
      commonly used in academic papers, official reports, or formal presentations to convey authority
      and thoroughness, indicating that the compilation was performed by means of the stated research.
      This formal construction asserts the credibility and meticulousness of the work, reinforcing the
      gravity and importance of the report.
    etymology: This application of 'にて' highlights its function in indicating the foundation or method
      of an action, particularly in contexts requiring a dignified or official declaration. It formally
      links the creation of the report to the extensive research, underscoring the methodical and authoritative
      process. This use extends the particle's historical role of marking means to abstract concepts like
      'basis' or 'foundation,' thereby maintaining its formal and precise character in academic and professional
      discourse. It ensures that the report's origin and methodology are presented with utmost clarity
      and respectability, consistent with the particle's inherent formal quality.
post_example_writeup: 「にて」 is also found in certain fixed phrases, contributing to its formal and somewhat
  elevated nature. In such instances, its usage can be likened to saying "by virtue of" or "at which point."
  Familiarity with these specific usages will further enhance your understanding of this versatile formal
  particle. For instance, the phrase 「これにて」 (kore nite) is a common way to formally announce the conclusion
  of an event, as seen in the examples.
