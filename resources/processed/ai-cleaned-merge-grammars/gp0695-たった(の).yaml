        "nuance": "Emphasizes that a quantity, number, or time is surprisingly small or less than expected. It often carries a sense of disappointment, surprise, or understatement."
    },
    "etymology": "たった is derived from ただ, meaning \"only\" or \"merely,\" with added emphasis. It highlights a sense of unexpectedly small quantity or a minimal extent. This intensification can make the statement more impactful.",
    "writeup": "たった is a common adverb in Japanese that originates from an emphasized alteration of ただ ('only', 'merely'). たった retains the meaning of ただ by expressing that something is \"only (A)\", \"just (A)\", or \"no more than (A)\".\n\nThis nuance is typically used when the actual number or quantity of (A) is exceptionally low compared to the speaker's expectation or anticipation. For example, if someone expects 10 people but only 2 show up, they might say: **たった**２人しか来なかったね (Only two people came, huh?).\n\nたった will often appear at the beginning of sentences and can modify the entire sentence, or a specific number when followed by の, as in **たったの**３つ (only three). As たった is an adverb primarily used for emphasis, it frequently accompanies other similar grammatical patterns like だけ (only) or しか (only, with negative connotation).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   When used with time expressions, such as **たった今** (tatta ima), it emphasizes that something happened \"just now\" or \"right this instant,\" highlighting the immediate past.\n*   It can also be used to emphasize singularity, such as **たった一人** (tatta hitori), meaning \"only one person\" or \"all alone.\"\n\n**Fun-fact**: The common expression ただいま ('I'm home') may occasionally be seen in the emphasized form たったいま. This is primarily when the meaning is 'now', or 'just now' (right at this present moment), rather than 'I'm home', highlighting the immediacy of an action.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "Unlike たった, 僅かに (wazukani) often describes a small degree or amount in a neutral sense, rather than highlighting an unexpectedly low quantity or emphasizing singularity. It can refer to a subtle difference or a barely perceptible quantity."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that たった emphasizes a surprisingly small quantity or singular existence, often carrying a sense of speaker surprise or mild disappointment. In contrast, 僅かに describes a small degree or amount in a more general sense, without necessarily implying a deviation from expectation. For instance, 僅かに残っている (only a little remains) simply states a small quantity, whereas たった３人しか来なかった (only three people came) implies the speaker expected more.",
