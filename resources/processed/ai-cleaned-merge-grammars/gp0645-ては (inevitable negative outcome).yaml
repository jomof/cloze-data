    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ては」 is a combination of the 「て」-form of a verb (or adjective) and the particle 「は」. The 「て」-form indicates a reason or cause, and 「は」 adds a nuance of contrast or emphasis, highlighting the negative consequence that follows. This combination effectively creates a conditional clause where the condition inevitably leads to a problematic or undesirable outcome.",
    "writeup": "「ては」 expresses that if a certain condition is met, a negative result will follow. It can be translated as \"if,\" \"when,\" or \"because,\" but it always carries a negative connotation. It indicates that the speaker believes the condition will lead to an undesirable outcome. This grammar point serves to highlight an inevitable negative consequence of a particular action or state.When 「ては」 follows a noun or a な-adjective, 「では」 is used instead. In casual speech, 「ては」 and 「では」 are frequently contracted to 「ちゃ」 and 「じゃ」, respectively. This informal usage maintains the same core meaning of negative consequence.\n\nWhile 「ては」 can describe repeating actions, its primary use, especially in contexts implying judgment or assessment, is to warn against a potential situation due to its negative implications. It implies a sense of inevitability regarding the negative outcome if the condition described is met or continues. It's often used when expressing concerns or criticisms, linking an action or state directly to an undesirable result. For example, a parent might use it to warn a child about the consequences of their actions, or an expert might use it to point out a flaw in a plan.",
