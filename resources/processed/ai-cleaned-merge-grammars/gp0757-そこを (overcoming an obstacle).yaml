    },
    "etymology": "「そこ」 refers to the place or situation that presents a problem. 「を」 indicates that one is trying to move past or overcome that situation. Thus, 「そこを」 implies 'overcoming that place/situation'. This grammatical construction evolved from the spatial meaning of 'that place' to a metaphorical 'that point' or 'that obstacle', which the speaker wishes to 'pass through' or 'overcome' with the help of the listener.",
    "writeup": "「そこを」 is used as a conjunction to express a desire for someone to do something despite a difficult or problematic situation. It carries a nuance of imploring or requesting special consideration. Think of it as pleading for someone to 'somehow' or 'in some way' overcome the stated difficulty. It's often used when asking for a favor or making a request that might be difficult to fulfill. It is similar to saying \"I know it's difficult, but...\" or \"Even so...\". This expression acknowledges the difficulty first, then makes a strong appeal for special consideration or effort to surmount that specific obstacle. It is versatile and can be used in various registers, from casual personal appeals to highly formal business negotiations, always retaining its core function of a strong, often earnest, request to overcome an acknowledged problem.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「そこを」 which expresses an appeal to overcome a difficulty, 「そこで」 indicates a direct consequence or transition based on a prior event or condition. It acts as a logical connector, meaning 'at that point, therefore, then'.",

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "It is important to distinguish 「そこを」 from similar conjunctions like 「そこで」 and 「それなのに」. 「そこを」 specifically implies an appeal to overcome a difficulty, often with an emotional or persuasive tone. In contrast, 「そこで」 indicates a logical consequence or a sequential action. 「それなのに」, on the other hand, expresses a contrasting or unexpected outcome. Therefore, always consider the context and the speaker's intent when choosing the correct conjunction; 「そこを」 signals a direct plea against an acknowledged obstacle.",
