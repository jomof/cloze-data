    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Noun/Adjective + は + 〜で有名」 is used to express that something or someone is **famous for** a particular quality, characteristic, or reason. \n\n*   The 「は」 particle marks the topic.\n*   「で」 indicates the reason or cause for the fame.\n*   「有名」 itself is a noun that functions as a *na*-adjective, meaning \"famous\" or \"well-known.\"\n\nThis pattern is quite versatile and frequently used to describe the defining characteristics of places, people, or things. Note that when the reason for fame is a phrase or clause, it is often followed by 「こと」 (or 「の」), which nominalizes the preceding expression, allowing 「で」 to attach.",
