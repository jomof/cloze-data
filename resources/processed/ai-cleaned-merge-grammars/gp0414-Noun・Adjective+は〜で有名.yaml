    "etymology": "有名 (yūmei) is formed from 有 (yū), meaning \"to have\" or \"possess,\" and 名 (mei), meaning \"name\" or \"reputation.\" Thus, 有名 literally means \"having a name,\" implying that something or someone has a widespread reputation or is well-known.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Noun/Adjective + は + 〜で有名」 is used to express that something or someone is **famous for** a particular quality, characteristic, or reason. \n\n*   The 「は」 particle marks the topic.\n*   「で」 indicates the reason or cause for the fame.\n*   「有名」 itself is a noun that functions as a *na*-adjective, meaning \"famous\" or \"well-known.\"\n\nThis pattern is quite versatile and frequently used to describe the defining characteristics of places, people, or things.",
