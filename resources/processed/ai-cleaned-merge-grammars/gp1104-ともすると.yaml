        "Register": "Formal; often used in writing and formal speech.",
        "Nuance": "Expresses a predisposition or inclination toward a certain outcome, often negative.",
        "Usage": "Frequently used to describe general tendencies or potential consequences."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「ともすると」 is derived from the verb 「する」 (to do). The 「とも」 adds a sense of 'easily' or 'readily,' suggesting that something happens without much resistance or effort. The full phrase suggests a strong likelihood of a particular outcome.",
    "writeup": "「ともすると」 expresses that something tends to happen or is likely to occur. It suggests a predisposition or inclination toward a specific outcome. It's often used to point out potential negative consequences or tendencies. It is more frequently used in formal speech and writing than in casual conversation, and it leans towards expressing general tendencies rather than specific instances.",
