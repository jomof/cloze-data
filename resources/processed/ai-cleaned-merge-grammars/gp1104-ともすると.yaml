        "Usage": "Frequently used to describe general tendencies or potential consequences."

    "etymology": "The phrase 「ともすると」 is derived from the verb 「する」 (to do). The 「とも」 adds a sense of 'easily' or 'readily,' suggesting that something happens without much resistance or effort. The full phrase suggests a strong likelihood of a particular outcome.",

It's often used to point out potential negative consequences or tendencies. It is more frequently used in formal speech and writing than in casual conversation, and it leans towards expressing general tendencies rather than specific instances.",
