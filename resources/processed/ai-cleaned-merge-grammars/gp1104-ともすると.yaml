        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "nuance": "Expresses a predisposition or inclination toward a certain outcome, often negative.",
        "colocation": "Often precedes verbs or phrases indicating a negative or problematic outcome, e.g., 「〜してしまいがち」, 「〜に陥りやすい」, 「〜になる」.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as an adverbial phrase, modifying the verb or clause that follows it, indicating a strong tendency or likelihood."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「ともすると」 is derived from the verb 「する」 (to do). The 「とも」 adds a sense of 'easily' or 'readily,' suggesting that something happens without much resistance or effort. The full phrase suggests a strong likelihood of a particular outcome.",
    "writeup": "「ともすると」 is a formal expression that signifies a strong tendency or likelihood for something to occur, especially an undesirable outcome. It implies that a certain situation or action can easily lead to a specific result, often without much resistance. While it indicates a predisposition, it differs from simply stating a probability by suggesting an inherent inclination.\n\nThis grammar point is frequently encountered in formal speech and writing, such as academic papers, news articles, or business communications, rather than in casual conversation. It is used to describe general tendencies or potential consequences, highlighting a characteristic behavior or an inherent risk. It is particularly effective when you want to emphasize that a certain condition or action can easily lead to a negative or problematic situation. For instance, it might be used to describe how a particular management style can easily foster bureaucracy or how continuous stress can easily lead to irrational decisions. While the outcome it describes is often negative, it is not exclusively so, though this is its most common usage.",
