It implies that a continuous or persistent state or action can easily lead to a specific outcome. The phrase often expresses a perceived natural progression or susceptibility under certain circumstances. It describes the ease with which a particular outcome can materialize, given the initial conditions."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「ともすると」 is derived from the verb 「する」 (to do). The 「とも」 adds a sense of 'easily' or 'readily,' suggesting that something happens without much resistance or effort. The full phrase suggests a strong likelihood of a particular outcome.",
    "writeup": "「ともすると」 is a formal expression that signifies a strong tendency or likelihood for something to occur, especially an undesirable outcome. It implies that a certain situation or action can easily lead to a specific result, often without much resistance. While it indicates a predisposition, it differs from simply stating a probability by suggesting an inherent inclination. It describes a situation where an outcome is not just possible, but rather easily and naturally brought about by specific circumstances.\n\nThis grammar point is frequently encountered in formal speech and writing, such as academic papers, news articles, or business communications, rather than in casual conversation. It is used to describe general tendencies or potential consequences, highlighting a characteristic behavior or an inherent risk. It is particularly effective when you want to emphasize that a certain condition or action can easily lead to a negative or problematic situation. For instance, it might be used to describe how a particular management style can easily foster bureaucracy or how continuous stress can easily lead to irrational decisions. While the outcome it describes is often negative, it is not exclusively so, though this is its most common usage. It suggests that a natural, almost effortless, progression leads to the stated result, often due to an inherent characteristic or constant factor. For instance, a very humid climate 「ともすると」 (easily) leads to mold, or a very busy person 「ともすると」 (easily) forgets appointments. It points to an almost inherent susceptibility rather than just a possibility.",
