    "etymology": "This grammar pattern combines the topic marker 「は」 (wa), the approximate/extent particle 「くらい」 (kurai), and the polite copula 「です」 (desu). Historically, 「くらい」 evolved from 「くらべ」 (kurabe), meaning 'comparison'. When combined with 「は」, it sets the scope of the topic, and then 「くらい」 limits it, literally meaning 'the extent is that'. This creates the nuance of 'about the only' or 'to the extent that'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「は〜くらいです」 is used to convey that something (B) is the limit or extent of something else (A). It's a precise way to state that very little else exists beyond a specified boundary, often implying a sense of 'only' or 'just' within that context.\n\nTo use this pattern, the element being limited (A) comes before 「は」, highlighting the situation, place, thing, or person that has a defined limit. The limitation itself (B) then follows, with 「くらいです」 (or its casual equivalent 「くらいだ」) completing the sentence. This structure frames B as the absolute or approximate boundary for A.\n\nFor additional emphasis, especially when highlighting an exceptional case or a limited characteristic, 「くらいなものです」 or 「くらいのものでした」 can be used. These variations reinforce the idea that the specified condition is truly the sole or primary factor.",

            "nuance": "「だけ」 is a direct marker for 'only' or 'just', often implying exclusivity. 「は〜くらいです」, while conveying a similar sense of limitation, emphasizes the *extent* or *degree* to which something is limited, rather than simply stating it as the sole item."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「くらい」, 「ほど」, and 「だけ」 can all express degrees or limitations, it is crucial to understand their distinct nuances. Use 「くらい」 alone for approximation. Use 「ほど」 to indicate a degree or comparison. When you want to convey that something is *only* a certain amount or *to the extent that* a specific condition applies, emphasizing the boundary or rarity of that condition, then 「は〜くらいです」 is the appropriate choice. It highlights a limited scope by framing the specified item as the boundary.",
