formation:
  '[Potential Verb] + ものなら': Used to express a hypothetical situation where an action is barely possible,
    often followed by a strong desire or a consequence. It highlights the difficulty or impossibility
    of the action.
  '[Potential Verb] + ものだろうか': Used to express a strong, often wistful, desire or wonder about achieving
    something difficult or seemingly impossible. It poses a rhetorical question about the possibility.
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  usage-context: Used in contexts where the speaker considers an action to be highly difficult, improbable,
    or impossible, but wishes it were possible or considers the consequences if it were.
  function: Expresses a hypothetical condition or a strong, often wistful, desire, emphasizing the difficulty
    or impossibility of the action.
  nuance: Conveys a sense of longing, challenge, or even resignation regarding a difficult or unattainable
    action. 「ものなら」 often implies a 'if only I could...' with a subsequent action or consequence, while
    「ものだろうか」 is more of a rhetorical question expressing a wish or doubt.
  grammatical-role: Conditional/Volitional expression
etymology: The phrase combines the nominalizer 「もの」 (mono) with the conditional 「なら」 (nara) or the conjectural
  rhetorical question 「だろうか」 (darou ka). Historically, 「もの」 emphasizes the 'thing' or 'event' of the potential
  action. Thus, it literally means 'if it were the case that one could (do V)' or 'is it the case that
  one could (do V), I wonder?', thereby highlighting the nature of the hypothetical or desired ability,
  often implying its difficulty or unlikeliness.
writeup: |-
  The grammatical pattern 「ものなら」 or 「ものだろうか」 is used to discuss hypothetical situations or express strong desires concerning actions that are difficult, improbable, or even impossible to achieve. It adds a layer of nuance beyond simple conditionals by emphasizing the challenge or unlikelihood of the action.

  **ものなら (mono nara)**
  This form is typically used with a potential verb and suggests a strong, often wistful, 'if only I could...' scenario. It often implies that if the difficult action *were* possible, then a certain consequence would follow, or the speaker would do something. It highlights the slim chance or the sheer difficulty of the action. It can sometimes carry a tone of challenge or defiance, meaning 'if you dare/can, then...'.

  **ものだろうか (mono darou ka)**
  Also used with a potential verb, this form functions as a rhetorical question, expressing a deep desire or wondering about the possibility of something difficult. It translates to 'I wonder if I could (V)' or 'I wish I could (V)'. The speaker is usually acknowledging the difficulty but still expressing a longing for that outcome. It often conveys a sense of resignation or a hopeful, yet uncertain, wish.

  Both forms convey a strong emotional investment in the hypothetical situation, emphasizing the gap between the speaker's desire/consideration and the reality of the situation.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜たら (conditional)
    meaning: If, when, after
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たら」 is a general conditional without the specific nuance of expressing a highly difficult
      or almost impossible hypothetical situation. It's a neutral 'if X, then Y'.
    grammar_point: たら (conditional, when・if A then B)
  - term: 〜ば (conditional)
    meaning: If, when
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「たら」, 「ば」 is a standard conditional. It doesn't inherently convey the sense of
      difficulty or the strong, often wistful, desire present in 「ものなら・ものだろうか」.
    grammar_point: ば (conditional, if A then B)
  - term: 〜たい (desiderative)
    meaning: Want to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たい」 expresses a straightforward desire. 「ものなら・ものだろうか」, in contrast, expresses a desire specifically
      for something that is difficult or seems impossible to achieve, adding a layer of complexity and
      often wistfulness to the wish.
    grammar_point: たい (want to do)
  - term: 〜ても (even if・even though)
    meaning: Even if, even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ても」 sets up a concession, implying that something will happen or be true *regardless* of
      the condition. While it deals with hypothetical situations, it doesn't carry the 'if only I could
      (do something very difficult)' nuance of 「ものなら」 or the 'I wonder if I could (do something seemingly
      impossible)' nuance of 「ものだろうか」.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: '[V-potential]ものだ (general truth expectation)'
    meaning: Indicates something is natural, expected, or supposed to be a certain way.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While it also uses 「もの」 and a potential verb, 「V-potential + ものだ」 expresses a general truth,
      common sense, or a strong expectation ('should be able to', 'it is natural to be able to'). It lacks
      the specific hypothetical, difficult-to-achieve, or wistful desire nuance of 「ものなら・ものだろうか」.
    grammar_point: ものだ (general truth expectation)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「ものなら・ものだろうか」 from other conditionals or expressions of
  desire, pay close attention to the speaker's implied sentiment. This grammar point specifically highlights
  the speaker's perception of the action as difficult or improbable, unlike simpler conditionals. For
  example, if you want to say 'if I could go to space,' and you perceive this as a highly challenging
  or unlikely feat, you would use 「行けるものなら」. If it were a simple hypothetical without that nuance, 「行けたら」
  would suffice. Similarly, a wish for something difficult is expressed with 「ものだろうか」, whereas a simple
  wish is just 「〜たい」.
examples:
  - english: If I could turn back time, I'd apologize to him.
    japanese:
      - あの 時 に 戻れる もの なら、彼 に 謝り たい。
      - あの 時 に 戻れる もの でし たら、彼 に 謝り たい。
      - あの 時 に 戻れる もん なら、彼 に 謝り たい。
    english_literally: If I could return to that time, I want to apologize to him.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時 に 戻れ たら、彼 に 謝り たい。
        english: If I could return to that time, I'd apologize to him (neutral conditional).
        hint: This uses a simple conditional 「〜たら」, which doesn't carry the same nuance of extreme difficulty
          or regret as 「ものなら」. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes the unlikelihood.
    scene: A person reflecting on a past mistake they deeply regret, knowing they cannot change it.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The use of 「戻れる もの なら」 emphasizes the impossibility and the deep regret of being unable to
      go back in time. It's a strong 'if only' statement.
    etymology: The combination of the potential form of a verb with 「ものなら」 creates a highly conditional
      and often wistful or regretful hypothetical, underscoring the unlikelihood of the condition.
  - english: If you can make a mistake, just go ahead and make it. It's part of learning.
    japanese:
      - 間違い が 出来る もの なら、やっ て みろ。それ も 勉強 だ。
      - 間違い が 出来る もの でし たら、やっ て み て ください。それ も 勉強 です。
      - 間違い が 出来る もん なら、やっ て みろ。それ も 勉強 だ。
    english_literally: If a mistake can be made, try doing it. That too is studying.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もし 間違い を 犯し たら、それ も 勉強 だ。
        english: If you make a mistake, that's also part of learning (simple conditional).
        hint: This uses a simple 'if' clause with 「もし〜たら」. It lacks the challenging, almost dare-like
          nuance of 「ものなら」, which implies 'if you're even capable of it, try it'. We're looking for an
          expression that challenges the listener to perform a difficult action.
    scene: A mentor encouraging a hesitant student to take risks.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Here, 「出来る もの なら」 is used as a challenge or invitation, implying 'if it's even possible (for
      you to make a mistake in this context), then do it'. The speaker's tone is encouraging but also
      acknowledges the potential difficulty or hesitation from the listener. The use of 「〜みろ」 adds to
      the casual, direct, and slightly challenging tone typical of an older male mentor to younger students.
    etymology: 「やってみろ」 is a masculine casual imperative, commonly used by men when giving direct instructions
      or challenges, especially to those younger or of lower status. The 「ものなら」 here gives a sense of
      'go ahead and try if you can', emphasizing the act of attempting something difficult.
  - english: I wonder if I could fly in the sky just once.
    japanese:
      - 一 度 で いい から、空 を 飛べる もの だろう か。
      - 一 度 で いい から、空 を 飛べる もの で あろう か。
    english_literally: Just once is good, I wonder if I could fly the sky.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一 度 で いい から、空 を 飛べ たら いい な。
        english: It'd be nice if I could fly in the sky just once (simple wish).
        hint: This expresses a simple wish using 「〜たら いいな」. It doesn't convey the sense of 'wondering
          if it's even possible' due to the inherent difficulty, which 「ものだろうか」 implies. We're looking
          for an expression that questions the very possibility.
    scene: A child or an adult gazing at birds, expressing a fantastical wish.
    register: casual
    setting: creative
    nuance: 「飛べる ものだろうか」 conveys a strong, wistful desire to do something physically impossible for humans,
      framed as a rhetorical question. The phrase 「一度 で いい から」 intensifies the longing, implying 'just
      once would be enough' to satisfy this deep wish.
    etymology: The phrase 「一度 で いい から」 emphasizes the desire for even a single instance of something,
      often used for things that are difficult or impossible to achieve. Combined with 「ものだろうか」, it heightens
      the sense of yearning.
  - english: Is there really nothing that can be done to help him?
    japanese:
      - 彼 を 助け られる もの だろう か。
      - 彼 を 助け られる もの で あろう か。
    english_literally: Can he be helped, I wonder?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 を 助け られる か な。
        english: Can we help him? (simple question).
        hint: This uses the simple question particle 「かな」. It's a direct question about ability, lacking
          the rhetorical, almost desperate tone that wonders if it's truly possible, which 「ものだろうか」 implies.
          We're looking for an expression that conveys a deeper sense of inquiry about possibility.
    scene: Two friends discussing a third friend's seemingly hopeless situation.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「助けられる ものだろうか」 expresses a genuine concern and a questioning of whether a difficult situation
      can be overcome. It's not a mere 'can he be saved?', but 'is there *any* way he could possibly be
      saved?' showing deep worry or desperation.
    etymology: The potential form 「助けられる」 (can save/help) combined with 「ものだろうか」 (I wonder if it's possible)
      emphasizes the uncertainty and the deep-seated concern about the ability to help someone in a difficult
      situation. It highlights the speaker's contemplation of the difficulty.
  - english: If I could quit my job right now, I would.
    japanese:
      - 今 すぐ 仕事 を 辞め られる もの なら 辞め たい。
      - 今 すぐ 仕事 を 辞め られる もの でし たら 辞め たい です。
      - 今 すぐ 仕事 を 辞め られる もん なら 辞め たい。
    english_literally: If I could quit work immediately, I want to quit.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今 すぐ 仕事 を 辞め られ たら 辞め たい。
        english: If I could quit my job right now, I'd want to (standard conditional).
        hint: This uses a standard conditional 「〜たら」. While it expresses a wish, it doesn't emphasize
          the underlying difficulty or obstacles to quitting the job as strongly as 「ものなら」 does. We're
          looking for an expression that highlights the challenge.
    scene: A tired worker complaining to a colleague after a long day.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「辞められる もの なら」 emphasizes the strong desire to quit, implying that while it's difficult
      or has significant obstacles (e.g., financial stability, responsibilities), if it were possible
      to overcome them, she would do so. This is a common sentiment expressed among close friends.
    etymology: The use of 「辞めたい」 after 「辞められる もの なら」 directly links the hypothetical possibility to the
      speaker's strong desire, a common construction with 「ものなら」 when expressing a deeply held wish despite
      practical difficulties.
  - english: If only I could meet him just once more, I would tell him how I feel.
    japanese:
      - もう 一 度 だけ 会える もの なら、私 の 気持ち を 伝え たい。
      - もう 一 度 だけ 会える もの でし たら、私 の 気持ち を 伝え たい です。
    english_literally: If I could meet him just one more time, I want to convey my feelings.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 一 度 だけ 会え たら、私 の 気持ち を 伝え たい。
        english: If I could meet him just once more, I would tell him how I feel (neutral conditional).
        hint: This uses a simple conditional 「〜たら」. It expresses a hypothetical possibility but doesn't
          carry the poignant, almost impossible longing that 「ものなら」 conveys. We're looking for an expression
          that emphasizes the deep, often unfulfillable, wish.
    scene: Someone yearning for a lost connection, perhaps after a breakup or a departure.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: This usage of 「会える もの なら」 vividly expresses a poignant 'if only' for a reunion that is either
      physically impossible (due to distance, death) or emotionally unattainable. It conveys deep longing.
    etymology: The structure 「もう一度 だけ」 emphasizes the singular, cherished nature of the desired meeting,
      further enhancing the melancholic nuance when combined with the near-impossible hypothetical of
      「会える もの なら」.
  - english: I wonder if I could ever live abroad. It seems so difficult.
    japanese:
      - いつ か 海外 で 暮らせる もの だろう か。とても 難しい こと だ と 思う。
      - いつ か 海外 で 暮らせる もの で あろう か。とても 難しい こと だ と 思い ます。
    english_literally: Someday abroad, I wonder if I could live. I think it is a very difficult thing.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - いつ か 海外 で 暮らせる か な。とても 難しい こと だ と 思う。
        english: I wonder if I can live abroad someday (simple wonder).
        hint: Using 「かな」 just expresses a casual wonder. It doesn't convey the same underlying sense of
          doubt about the feasibility of the difficult action that 「ものだろうか」 does. We're looking for an
          expression that questions the possibility due to perceived difficulty.
    scene: A young adult contemplating their future, feeling daunted by big dreams.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「暮らせる ものだろうか」 reflects a hopeful but uncertain outlook on achieving a significant life change
      like living abroad, acknowledging its inherent difficulties. It's a personal pondering rather than
      a direct question.
    etymology: The addition of 「とても 難しい こと だ と 思う」 explicitly states the perceived difficulty, reinforcing
      the subtle implication of unlikeliness that 「ものだろうか」 already carries.
  - english: If you can criticize someone, why don't you try doing it yourself?
    japanese:
      - 文句 が 言える もの なら、自分 で やっ て みれ ば いい じゃ ない か。
      - 文句 が 言える もの でし たら、ご 自分 で やっ て みれ ば いい の で は ない でしょう か。
      - 文句 が 言える もん なら、自分 で やっ て みれ ば いい じゃ ない か。
    english_literally: If complaints can be said, why don't you try doing it yourself?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 文句 を 言う なら、自分 で やっ て みれ ば いい じゃ ない か。
        english: If you're going to complain, why don't you try doing it yourself? (direct conditional).
        hint: This uses a direct conditional 「〜なら」, which simply sets a condition. It lacks the challenging,
          almost defiant nuance of 「ものなら」, implying 'if you're even capable of it, try it'. We're looking
          for an expression that dares the listener to act.
    scene: A person frustrated with someone's constant complaints but lack of action.
    register: casual
    setting: sarcastic
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「言える もの なら」 used here is highly rhetorical and carries a sarcastic, challenging
      tone, implying 'you can talk the talk, but can you walk the walk?'. It's a direct challenge for
      the critic to put their words into action. The 「〜じゃないか」 ending makes it more assertive and argumentative.
    etymology: 「やってみれば いい じゃないか」 is a common casual expression to challenge someone to 'try it yourself'
      or suggest 'why don't you just do it?', often used with a slightly exasperated or sarcastic tone
      when one is tired of someone's complaints or inaction.
  - english: Could I possibly understand quantum physics? I doubt it.
    japanese:
      - 量子 物理 学 が 理解 できる もの だろう か。無理 だ と 思う けど。
      - 量子 物理 学 が 理解 できる もの で あろう か。無理 だ と 思い ます けど。
    english_literally: Quantum physics, could it be understood? I think it's impossible, but...
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 量子 物理 学 が 理解 できる か な。無理 だ と 思う けど。
        english: I wonder if I can understand quantum physics (simple question).
        hint: Using 「かな」 makes it a simple, casual question. It doesn't convey the same level of profound
          doubt or the sense of 'is it even within the realm of possibility for me?' that 「ものだろうか」 implies.
          We're looking for an expression that questions the very possibility of understanding something
          difficult.
    scene: A student struggling with a complex subject, expressing self-doubt.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    nuance: 「理解 できる ものだろうか」 is used here to express self-doubt and a sense of overwhelm when facing a
      highly challenging academic subject. It's a genuine internal question about one's capability, reinforced
      by the follow-up of 'I think it's impossible'.
    etymology: The scientific term 「量子物理学」 (ryōshi butsurigaku - quantum physics) immediately sets a context
      of high intellectual difficulty, making the self-doubt expressed by 「できる ものだろうか」 particularly apt.
  - english: If I could find a solution to this problem, I would do anything.
    japanese:
      - この 問題 の 解決 策 が 見つけ られる もの なら、何 で も する。
      - この 問題 の 解決 策 が 見つけ られる もの でし たら、何 で も いたし ます。
    english_literally: If a solution to this problem could be found, I would do anything.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 問題 の 解決 策 が 見つけ られ たら、何 で も する。
        english: If I could find a solution to this problem, I would do anything (neutral conditional).
        hint: This uses a simple conditional 「〜たら」. While it expresses a hypothetical, it doesn't convey
          the strong emphasis on the difficulty of finding the solution or the intense determination to
          overcome obstacles that 「ものなら」 implies. We're looking for an expression that highlights the
          challenge and the speaker's willingness to go to great lengths.
    scene: A researcher or team leader facing a critical, seemingly insurmountable problem.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: In a professional setting, 「見つけられる もの なら」 emphasizes the critical nature and high difficulty
      of finding a solution, suggesting that if such an unlikely event occurred, the speaker would be
      willing to make any sacrifice. This shows deep commitment and acknowledges the challenge.
    etymology: The phrase 「何でも する」 (do anything) is a common expression of extreme determination or willingness,
      which pairs well with the highly conditional and challenging nature of 「ものなら」 in a professional
      context, implying a 'no stone un-turned' attitude.
post_example_writeup: These examples illustrate how 「ものなら」 and 「ものだろうか」 are used to express hypotheticals
  or desires concerning actions that are perceived as difficult, improbable, or impossible. The choice
  between the two often depends on whether the speaker is considering a direct consequence or posing a
  rhetorical question about the possibility. Regardless, both forms add a significant emotional and nuanced
  layer to the statement, highlighting the challenging nature of the action.
