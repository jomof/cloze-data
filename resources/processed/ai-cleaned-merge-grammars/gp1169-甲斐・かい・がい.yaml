    "writeup": "The dependent noun 「甲斐・かい・がい」 expresses the idea that something is \"worth\" the effort put into it, or that there is \"value\" in doing something. It often appears in the patterns 「甲斐がある」 (there is worth/value) or 「甲斐がない」 (there is no worth/value). The reading shifts from 「かい」 to 「がい」 in some compound words, so pay close attention. It can also describe something is meaningful or rewarding, as in 「やり甲斐がある」 (worth doing). The phrase 「その甲斐があって」 connects an action with its positive result, signifying that the effort was not in vain. This grammar point is versatile for expressing purpose and accomplishment.",
    "etymology": "「甲斐」 originally referred to a region in present-day Yamanashi Prefecture known for its skilled craftsmanship and resources. Over time, it came to represent 'value' or 'worth' associated with diligent work and effort. The kanji 甲 (kō) itself signifies 'shell' or 'armor,' but in this context, it implies a protective layer of value or benefit gained from one's endeavors. In short, the etymology suggests that effort yields a valuable return, much like the resources from the 甲斐 region.",
