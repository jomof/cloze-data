    "etymology": "The word 「甲斐」 originally referred to a region in present-day Yamanashi Prefecture, known for its resources and value. Over time, it evolved to signify 'worth' or 'value' in a more abstract sense.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「甲斐・かい・がい」 is used to express that an action or effort was worthwhile, leading to a meaningful or satisfying outcome. It primarily functions as a dependent noun, indicating the \"worth,\" \"effect,\" or \"result\" of an endeavor. It is typically employed when reflecting on whether a past effort has yielded positive results, or when expressing the value derived from an ongoing action.\n\nIt is commonly used in conjunction with a verb in its plain form (especially past tense) or with a noun, followed by 「がある」 (to be worthwhile) or 「がない」 (to be not worthwhile). For instance, 「努力した甲斐があった」 conveys that \"the effort was worthwhile,\" implying satisfaction from the result.\n\nAnother significant usage is with the ます-stem of verbs, forming compound nouns like 「やり甲斐」 (worth doing) or 「生き甲斐」 (worth living for). These compounds specifically highlight the inherent value or purpose one finds in an activity or in life itself.\n\nFurthermore, 「その甲斐があって」 acts as a cohesive device, connecting a preceding sentence describing an effort with a subsequent sentence detailing the positive outcome directly resulting from that effort. This construction emphasizes a clear cause-and-effect relationship where the cause (effort) is deemed valuable due to its beneficial effect.",
