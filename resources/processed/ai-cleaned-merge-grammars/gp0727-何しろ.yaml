    "etymology": "The term 何しろ (nani shiro) is a compound formed from 何 (nani, \"what\") and しろ (shiro), which is the imperative form of する (suru, \"to do\"). While literally translating to something like \"do whatever it may be,\" its meaning has evolved over time to function as an adverb meaning \"in any case,\" \"anyway,\" or \"after all.\" This semantic shift reflects its usage in conveying a sense of inevitability or an undeniable foundational truth, regardless of other factors.",
    "writeup": "**何しろ (nani shiro)** is an adverb used to introduce or emphasize a reason, explanation, or circumstance that the speaker considers to be utterly undeniable, obvious, or a fundamental truth. It translates to phrases like \"after all,\" \"in any case,\" \"anyway,\" or \"no wonder.\" Its core function is to present a reason so compelling that the preceding or succeeding statement becomes an inevitable or logical consequence.\n\nThis expression is highly versatile and can appear at the beginning of a sentence, at the start of a second clause, or sometimes even mid-sentence to strongly connect a statement with its underlying justification. It is very commonly followed by causal conjunctions such as **から (kara)** or **ので (node)**, which further reinforces the explanatory nature of the clause introduced by 何しろ.\n\nThink of 何しろ as a linguistic tool to highlight the core reason for something, often implying a sense of \"it couldn't be any other way because...\" or \"it's completely understandable given that...\" when a justification is being provided. It elevates the subsequent reason to a position of undeniable importance, making the outcome seem a natural and expected result. It is widely used in both casual and more formal conversational contexts.",
