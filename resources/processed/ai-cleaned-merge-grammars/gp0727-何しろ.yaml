    "etymology": "The term 何しろ (nani shiro) comes from 何 (nani, \"what\") and しろ (shiro), which is the imperative form of する (suru, \"to do\"). Literally, it means \"do whatever it may be,\" which evolved to mean \"in any case\" or \"anyway.\"",
    "writeup": "**何しろ (nani shiro)** is an adverb used to emphasize the inevitability or importance of a situation. It translates to \"anyway,\" \"after all,\" or \"in any case.\" While it combines 何 (nani, \"what\") and the imperative しろ (shiro) of する (\"to do\"), it functions as a single adverb. It signifies that, regardless of other factors, a particular conclusion is the only logical or accurate one.\n\nThis expression is frequently placed at the beginning of a sentence or at the start of a second clause. It is often paired with conjunctions like **から (kara)** or **ので (node)** to strongly emphasize the reason or explanation for a given situation. Think of it as highlighting the obvious or unavoidable nature of something, often implying a sense of \"it can't be helped because…\" or \"no wonder because…\" when providing a justification.",
