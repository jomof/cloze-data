        "function": "Indicates the space through which movement occurs.",

        "grammatical-role": "The particle を follows the noun indicating the space or path of movement.",
        "logical-flow": "Indicates the path or area traversed during movement.",
        "temporal-flow": "Used with verbs that describe continuous or extended movement through a space.",
        "spatial-flow": "Clearly defines the physical area or trajectory of an action involving movement, such as walking *along* a road or flying *through* the sky. It marks the medium or surface of transit, emphasizing the action's progression across or within that expanse. For example, 『道を歩く』 (michio aruku) highlights the act of traversing the road itself, not merely being on it. This differs from other particles like 「で」 which denotes a static location where an action takes place, or 「に」 which indicates a specific destination or point of arrival. In essence, 「を」 conveys the dynamic interaction of a subject with the space it occupies during its movement, making the space an integral part of the action's trajectory rather than just a backdrop. It implies an engagement with the entirety of the spatial element as one moves through it, across it, or along it. This nuance is crucial for expressing how actions like 'crossing', 'passing through', or 'running along' are performed, by defining the spatial extent over which these actions unfold. It helps to visualize the movement as it carves a path or encompasses an area, making it a powerful particle for conveying the fluidity and directionality of actions within a given environment. The particle is typically used immediately after the noun that represents the space being navigated, establishing a direct link between the moving entity and its spatial context. This direct relationship underscores the particle's role in conveying the route or the expanse of the movement, which is fundamental to understanding the action's complete scope. The spatial element marked by 「を」 can be physical, like a road or a sky, or it can be metaphorical, as seen in expressions where one "

    "etymology": "The particle 「を」 originates from the verb 「離る (ha naru)」, meaning \"to separate\" or \"to move away from.\" Over time, its function evolved to indicate movement away from a starting point or, more broadly, movement through a space.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「を」 indicates movement through a space. It is used with verbs of motion to show the path or area traversed. Think of it as tracing the route someone or something takes, not just the destination. For example, 「公園{を}通って」 means \"passing through the park,\" not just going *to* the park. This particle highlights the trajectory or medium of movement, emphasizing the dynamic interaction between the subject and the space it occupies during transit. It's crucial for expressing actions like 'crossing,' 'passing along,' or 'running through,' as it clearly defines the expanse over which these actions unfold. 「を」 is particularly versatile, applicable to various scales of movement, from navigating a city street to flying across the sky. Understanding its role is fundamental to accurately describing spatial actions in Japanese.",
