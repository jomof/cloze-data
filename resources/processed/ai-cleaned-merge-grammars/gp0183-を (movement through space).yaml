    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「を」 clearly marks the path of movement, it is essential to distinguish its usage from other particles like 「に」 and 「で」. For instance, when using verbs like 「登る」(noboru - to climb), 「を」 specifies the *path traversed* (e.g., 「山{を}登る」- climbing along the mountain, traversing its surface), whereas 「に」 specifies the *destination* or *point of arrival* (e.g., 「山{に}登る」- climbing *to* the mountain, reaching its summit). Similarly, 「で」 indicates the *location where an action takes place* (e.g., 「公園{で}遊ぶ」- playing *in* the park), not the path of movement through it. Mastering these distinctions is key to precise expression.",
