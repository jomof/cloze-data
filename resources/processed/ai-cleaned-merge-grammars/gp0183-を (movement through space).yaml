    "writeup": "The particle 「を」 indicates movement through a space. It is used with verbs of motion to show the path or area traversed. Think of it as tracing the route someone or something takes, not just the destination. For example, 「公園{を}通って」 means \"passing through the park,\" not just going *to* the park.",
