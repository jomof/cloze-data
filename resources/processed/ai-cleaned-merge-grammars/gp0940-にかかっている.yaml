    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にかかっている」 comes from 「懸かる(かかる)」, which means \"to depend on\" or \"to rest on.\" The 「に」 particle indicates the target or direction of the dependence. The 「ている」 form signifies a continuous state, emphasizing that the dependence is ongoing or established.",
    "writeup": "「にかかっている」 is a grammar structure that means \"to depend on (A)\" or \"to rest on (A).\" It combines the case-marking particle 「に」 with the 「ている」 form of the verb 「懸かる(かかる)」, which means \"to depend.\" While 「にかかっている」 can follow nouns, it often follows set structures like 「かどうか」 (\"whether or not\") and 「か否か」 (\"yes or no\").\n\nThe 「に」 in 「にかかっている」 can sometimes be replaced with the adverb 「如何に(いかに)」 (\"how,\" \"in what way,\" or \"to what extent\"). In these situations, the meaning remains similar but extends to \"depending on the way in which (A)\" or \"depending on to what extent (A).\"\n\n「懸かる」 belongs to the same family of verbs as 「掛かる」, 「架かる」, and 「罹る」. These verbs share similar meanings but have slightly different nuances. Japanese has many verbs like this that have the same reading but change in nuance based on the kanji. Since kanji is not always used for these verbs, it is crucial to recognize which nuance is being used in each situation.",
