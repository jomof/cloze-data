        "function": "Adverbial modifier that softens or qualifies negative statements, indicating a lesser degree or frequency.",

    "etymology": "The word 「あまり」 comes from the verb 余る (amaru), meaning \"to remain, to be left over, to be in excess.\" Thus, 「あまり」 retains this sense of \"excess,\" but when used with the negative 「ない」, it indicates that something is *not* in excess, hence \"not very\" or \"hardly.\"",
    "writeup": "「あまり」 is a flexible word used in various grammar points. When paired with the 「ない」 form of a verb or adjective, it translates to \"not very (A)\" or \"hardly (A).\" To use 「あまり」 (or its casual form, 「あんまり」), you place it at the beginning of a phrase, or directly before the 「ない」 statement.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Although 「あまり〜ない」 is regularly translated as \"not very,\" the literal translation is closer to \"not excessively (A).\" \n*   「あまり」 retains this meaning of \"excessive\" in all its grammar points, and the nuance will only change based on whether the sentence itself is positive (does not use 「ない」) or negative (uses 「ない」).",
