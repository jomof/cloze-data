        "usage-context": "general"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ておく」 is derived from the verb 「置く (おく)」, which means \"to put\" or \"to place.\" When used as an auxiliary verb in the 「ておく」 form, it carries the nuance of \"doing something and leaving it in a certain state\" or \"doing something in advance for a specific purpose or future convenience.\"",
    "writeup": "「ておく」 expresses the idea of doing something in advance, preparing for a future event, or leaving something as is for a later purpose. It combines the -te form of a verb with the verb 「置く」 (oku), which typically means \"to put\" or \"to place.\" However, in this grammatical structure, 「置く」 functions as an auxiliary verb, taking on the meaning of \"doing something and leaving it in that state for future use or effect.\"\n\n**Nuance of Preparation and Foresight:** This grammar point implies a proactive approach, where an action is taken in anticipation of a future need or situation. This can range from simple preparations to more complex precautionary measures. For instance, 「晩ご飯を作っておく」 (ban gohan o tsukutte oku) means \"to make dinner in advance,\" implying that dinner is made now so it's ready for a future mealtime.\n\n**Contraction:** 「ておく」 is frequently contracted in casual speech to 「とく」 (or 「どく」 when the verb's -te form becomes -de, as in 「読んでおく」 becoming 「読んどく」). These contractions are very common in everyday conversation, as well as in media like dramas, anime, and manga. It is essential to recognize both the full and contracted forms.\n\n**Prevention:** 「ておく」 can also be used when the speaker is doing something specifically to prevent an undesirable future event from happening. For example, 「雨が降るから傘を持っておく」 (ame ga furu kara kasa wo motte oku) means \"I'll bring an umbrella in advance because it might rain,\" indicating a preventative measure.",
