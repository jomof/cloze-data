        "[Verb in て-form] + おく": "Indicates doing something in advance for a specific purpose or future need."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ておく」 is formed by combining the te-form of a verb with the auxiliary verb 「おく」 (oku). 「おく」, as a standalone verb, means \"to place\" or \"to put.\" When used as an auxiliary verb after the te-form, it takes on the meaning of doing something in advance or keeping something in a certain state for future use. The nuance is that the action is performed with a future benefit or purpose in mind.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ておく」 (teoku) expresses the idea of doing something in advance, preparing for a future event, or leaving something in a certain state. The verb 「置く」 (oku) itself means \"to place\" or \"to put\". When attached to the te-form of another verb, it conveys the sense of doing something and leaving it that way for future convenience or necessity.  It's **important** to note that 「ておく」 can also be contracted to 「とく」 or 「どく」 in casual speech. While not as common in formal settings, this contraction is frequently encountered in informal conversations, dramas, manga, and other media.",
