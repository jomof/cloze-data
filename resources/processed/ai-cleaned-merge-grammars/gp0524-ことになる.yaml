    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことになる」 combines 「こと」 (koto), which nominalizes a verb or adjective, 「に」 (ni), a particle indicating direction or purpose, and 「なる」 (naru), meaning \"to become.\" Literally, it translates to \"to become a thing,\" implying a natural consequence, a decision, or a resulting state.",
    "writeup": "「ことになる」 is an expression that combines the nominalizing use of 「こと」 (creating a noun phrase) with the case-marking particle 「に」, and the verb 「なる」 ('to become'). This expression can be translated as \"to become (A)\", but has the nuance that something or someone caused (A) to become that way. Due to this, it may also be translated as \"it has been decided that (A)\", or \"it will end up being (A)\". 「ことになる」 is primarily used with verbs and い-adjectives in their attributive form. It may also be used with な-adjectives followed by 「な」.\n\nThe meaning \"it has been decided that (A)\" primarily applies to verbs, as only verbs typically describe actions that can be enacted by someone or something. When used with nouns or adjectives, the meaning leans more towards an inevitable outcome or a logical conclusion.\n\nThis structure is a good example of why 「なる」 is often viewed as the intransitive form of 「する」. 「する」 conveys that someone is performing an action (transitive), while 「なる」 implies that something is the result of an action (intransitive). This is why the (A) phrase in 「ことになる」 is usually determined to have been decided or performed by someone else, or to be a natural consequence of circumstances, while still focusing on exactly 'what' (A) became.",

For expressing strong certainty about an outcome, use 「に決まっている」.
