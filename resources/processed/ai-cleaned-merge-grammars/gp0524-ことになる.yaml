    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことになる」 combines 「こと」 (koto), which nominalizes a verb or adjective, 「に」 (ni), a particle indicating direction or purpose, and 「なる」 (naru), meaning \"to become.\" Literally, it translates to \"to become a thing,\" implying a natural consequence, a decision, or a resulting state.",
    "writeup": "「ことになる」 is an expression that combines the nominalizing use of 「こと」 (creating a noun phrase) with the case-marking particle 「に」, and the verb 「なる」 ('to become'). This expression can be translated as \"to become (A)\", but has the nuance that something or someone caused (A) to become that way. Due to this, it may also be translated as \"it has been decided that (A)\", or \"it will end up being (A)\". 「ことになる」 is primarily used with verbs and い-adjectives in their attributive form. It may also be used with な-adjectives followed by 「な」.\n\nThe meaning \"it has been decided that (A)\" only applies to verbs, as only verbs will be enacted by someone or something.\n\nThis structure is a good example of why 「なる」 is often viewed as the intransitive form of 「する」. 「する」 conveys that someone is performing an action (transitive), while 「なる」 implies that something is the result of an action (intransitive). This is why the (A) phrase in 「ことになる」 is usually determined to have been decided or performed by someone else, while still focusing on exactly 'what' (A) became.",
