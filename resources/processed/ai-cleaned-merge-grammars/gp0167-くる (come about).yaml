There are two main usages:\n\n*   **Inceptive**: Indicates the beginning of a change or process. For example, 「雨が降って{きた}」 (ame ga futte {kita}) means \"it started to rain.\"\n*   **Continuative**: Indicates the continuation of an action or state from the past to the present. For example, 「ずっと勉強して{きた}」 (zutto benkyou shite {kita}) means \"I have been studying all along.\"\n\nIt's important to distinguish between the inceptive and continuative usages based on the context of the sentence. The choice of verb will greatly affect this nuance.",
