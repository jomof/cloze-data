For example, 「雨が降って{きた}」 (ame ga futte {kita}) means \"it started to rain.\"\n*   **Continuative**: Indicates the continuation of an action or state from the past to the present. For example, 「ずっと勉強して{きた}」 (zutto benkyou shite {kita}) means \"I have been studying all along.\"\n\nIt's important to distinguish between the inceptive and continuative usages based on the context of the sentence.

        "violation: Example 2's Japanese sentence was changed from `最近、少しずつ暖かくなって{きた}。` to `最近、少しずつ明るくなって{きた}。` because the kanji `暖` (warm) is N3, violating the rule that N4 grammar point examples should only use N4/N5 kanji. The new sentence uses N4 kanji `明` (bright). The `etymology` was also updated accordingly.",
        "violation: Example 4's Japanese sentence was changed from `お酒を飲んで{きた}から、顔が赤くなって{きた}。` to `最近、毎日運動してきたから、体力がついて{きた}。` because the kanji `酒` (N2) and `顔` (N3) violated the N4/N5 kanji rule. The new sentence uses only N4/N5 kanji. The `etymology` and `setting` were updated accordingly.",
        "violation: Example 5's Japanese sentence was changed from `この曲を聴いているうちに、だんだん好きになって{きた}。` to `この本を読んでいるうちに、だんだん面白くなって{きた}。` because the kanji `曲` (N3), `聴` (N2), and `好` (N3) violated the N4/N5 kanji rule. The new sentence uses only N4/N5 kanji. The `etymology` and `setting` were updated accordingly.",
        "violation: Example 6's Japanese sentence was changed from `最近、運動不足で太って{きました}。` to `最近、少しずつ体が大きくなって{きました}。` because the kanji `太` (N3) violated the N4/N5 kanji rule. The new sentence uses only N4/N5 kanji. The `etymology` and `setting` were updated accordingly.",
        "violation: Example 7 (flirty) was extensively revised. The original Japanese `君 の こと を 考える うち に 、 もっと 知り たく なっ て {きちゃった} 。` used N3 kanji `君` and a complex conjugation (`〜てきてしまう` as `きちゃった`) which did not directly align with the `conjugation` field's `past (plain)`. The sentence was changed to `あなたと会うたびに、もっと知りたく{なってくる}んだ。` to adhere strictly to N4/N5 kanji and use a clear `dictionary (plain non-past)` conjugation of the grammar point, addressing rule 6 concerning conjugation accuracy. This also ensured compliance with rules 7 and 8 for including a flirty and first-date context example. The `scene`, `conjugation`, `speaker_gender`, `listener_gender`, `nuance`, and `etymology` fields were all updated to reflect the new sentence.",
        "violation: Example 8's Japanese sentence was changed from `ずっと我慢して{きた}けど、もう限界だ！` to `この町に住んで{きた}ので、色々なことを知っています。` because the kanji `我慢` (N3) and `限` (N3) violated the N4/N5 kanji rule. The new sentence uses only N4/N5 kanji. The `setting`, `etymology`, and `nuance` were updated accordingly.",
        "violation: Example 9's Japanese sentence was changed from `最近、息子が反抗期になって{きました}。` to `日本語を勉強して{きた}から、もっと話せるようになった。` because multiple kanji (`息` N3, `反` N3, `抗` N1, `期` N3) violated the N4/N5 kanji rule. The new sentence uses only N4/N5 kanji. The `setting`, `conjugation`, `etymology`, and `nuance` were updated accordingly.",
