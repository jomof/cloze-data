    "etymology": "「別に」 (betsu ni) literally means \"separately\" or \"distinctly.\" When used with a negative verb, it takes on the nuance of \"not particularly\" or \"not especially.\" The negative form implies that there isn't a specific or significant reason for something.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「別に」 (betsu ni), meaning \"separately\" or \"distinctly,\" when paired with a negative form (〜ない), expresses the idea that something is \"not really\" or \"not particularly\" the case. This nuance of \"not particularly\" arises from the negation of \"separately\"; the literal meaning is akin to \"cannot be separated/differentiated (from other possibilities).\" This conveys the idea that while something might partially exist, it cannot be definitively categorized or stated as fully so. It implies that there's no specific or significant reason for something to be considered as such, offering a softer way of disagreeing or expressing indifference. It often carries a slightly detached or cool tone. It is important to note that 「別に」 is often paired with 「わけではない」 to soften the nuance of uncertainty, but it should **never** be used with 「わけがない」, as that would unnaturally combine an expression of removed certainty with one of strong certainty.",
