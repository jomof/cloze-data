    "etymology": "「別に」 (betsu ni) literally means \"separately\" or \"distinctly.\" When used with a negative verb, it takes on the nuance of \"not particularly\" or \"not especially.\" This nuance of \"not particularly\" arises from the negation of \"separately\"; the literal meaning is akin to \"cannot be separated/differentiated (from other possibilities).\" This conveys the idea that while something might partially exist, it cannot be definitively categorized or stated as fully so. It implies that there's no specific or significant reason for something to be considered as such.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「別に」 (betsu ni), meaning \"separately\" or \"distinctly,\" when paired with a negative form (〜ない), expresses the idea that something is \"not really\" or \"not particularly\" the case. This usage implies that there is no specific or significant reason for something to be considered in a certain way, offering a softer way of disagreeing or expressing indifference compared to a direct negation. It often carries a slightly detached or cool tone, suggesting that the matter is not a big concern for the speaker. While the general register is semi-formal, 「別に〜ない」 is very commonly used in casual conversations, especially among younger speakers. It is important to note that 「別に」 is often paired with 「わけではない」 to soften the nuance of uncertainty or to clarify a mild negation, but it should **never** be used with 「わけがない」, as that would unnaturally combine an expression of removed certainty with one of strong certainty.",
