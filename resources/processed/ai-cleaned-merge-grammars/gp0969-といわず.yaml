    "etymology": "The grammar point 「といわず」 is derived from 「と」 (a particle indicating quotation), 「言わず」 (the negative form of the verb 「言う」 meaning \"to say\"), and 「ず」 (a classical negative auxiliary verb, equivalent to 「ない」). The literal sense is \"without saying (A), and without saying (B)\", indicating that the statement applies beyond A and B.",
    "writeup": "「といわず」 indicates that something is not limited to either A or B, but applies to everything within a specific category or group. It translates to \"not only A or B, but all,\" or \"A, B, and everything else.\" It's a combination of the particle 「と」 (in its \"quotation\" use), the negative stem of 「言う」 (言わ), and the literary form of the classical auxiliary verb 「ず」. The literal meaning is 'without saying A, and without saying B, (C)', where 'without saying A' implies 'without limiting it to A'. The structure follows noun A and noun B before explaining what applies to everything. Both A and B should belong to a logical group for the expression to sound natural, such as \"hands and feet\" being parts of the body, or \"morning and afternoon\" being parts of a day. 「といわず〜といわず」 is a formal expression, less common in everyday speech.",
