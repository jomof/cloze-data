    "etymology": "The grammar point 「といわず」 is derived from 「と」 (a particle indicating quotation), 「言わず」 (iwazu), which is the negative form of the verb 「言う」 (iu, to say). Literally, it means \"without saying.\" The classical auxiliary verb 「ず」 adds a layer of formality.",
    "writeup": "When used in succession, 「といわず」 indicates that something is not limited to either (A) or (B), but applies to everything in a specific category or group. It may be translated as \"not just (A) or (B), but all\", or \"(A), (B) and everything else\". It is a combination of the case-marking particle 「と」 in its \"quotation\" use, the negative stem of 「言う」 (iwazu), and the literary form of the classical auxiliary verb 「ず」. The literal translation is simply \"without saying (A), and without saying (B), (C)\". This \"without saying (A)\" just means \"without limiting it to (A)\". This structure will follow both an (A) and a (B) noun before going on to explain what applies to everything.\n\nIt is **important** to remember that both (A) and (B) must be part of a logical group for the expression to sound natural. For example, hands and feet are parts of the body, morning and afternoon are parts of a day, the chorus and the melody are parts of a song, etc. 「といわず〜といわず」 is a fairly formal expression and is rarely used in everyday speech.",
