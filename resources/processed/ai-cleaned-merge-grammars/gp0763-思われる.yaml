        "Register": "Formal; Written",
        "Usage": "Used to express the speaker's tentative judgment or opinion, often in formal writing or speech. It softens assertions and conveys a sense of subjectivity.",
        "Nuance": "Indicates a degree of uncertainty or distance from a definitive statement. Often used when the speaker doesn't have complete confidence or wants to avoid being too assertive.",
        "Function": "Expressing opinion, speculation, or tentative judgment."

        "[Verb (plain form)] + と思われる": "It seems that...",
        "[Adjective (i-adjective, plain form)] + ように思われる": "It seems that...",
        "[Adjective (na-adjective, stem)] + である/だった + ように思われる": "It seems that...",

    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「思われる」 combines the verb 「思う」(omou, to think) in its passive/potential form. This construction creates a sense of something 'being thought' in a general sense, rather than a direct personal thought. It lends a more objective or distanced feel to the statement.",
    "writeup": "「思われる」 is used to express the speaker's subjective opinion or tentative judgment. It's a way of softening a statement, indicating that it's based on observation or inference rather than concrete certainty. This grammar point is more common in formal writing and speech. It's particularly useful when you want to avoid making strong assertions. Because of the passive voice implications, it is generally translated as 'it seems that', 'it is thought that', or 'appears to be'.\n\n*   **Register:** Predominantly used in formal settings, such as academic papers, news reports, and business presentations. Less common in casual conversation.\n*   **Function:** 「思われる」serves to soften the tone of a statement, making it less assertive and more open to interpretation. It's often employed when the speaker wants to express a degree of uncertainty or subjectivity.\n*   **Formation:** As shown above, there are different ways to form this, depending on whether it is connecting to a verb, i-adjective, na-adjective, or noun.\n*   **Important Considerations:** Remember that 「思われる」conveys a sense of subjectivity. It's suitable when you want to express an opinion or judgment without stating it as an absolute fact.",
