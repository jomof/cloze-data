The 'くする' part of the grammar point name is generally used with i-adjectives to make them adverbs (e.g., '大きくする'), and does not typically apply to the volitional form of verbs in this context of habitual effort or decision."

        "part-of-speech": "auxiliary verb",

        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "Expresses intention, conscious effort, or decision to make something a habit.",

        "grammatical-role": "Sentence-final auxiliary verb phrase"
    },
    "etymology": "「する」 generally means \"to do\". When attached to the volitional form of a verb (e.g., 「食べよう」), it indicates the act of \"doing\" that action or state intentionally or repeatedly. The 「に」 particle here implies a target state or outcome of the action.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[volitional-よう]+にする」 expresses the idea of consciously deciding to do something regularly, or making a consistent effort to incorporate an action into one's routine. It conveys a strong sense of intention and commitment to establishing a new habit or behavior. For example, 「毎日、運動しよう にする」 (to make an effort to exercise every day) implies a sustained effort over time, not just a one-off attempt. This distinguishes it from 「Verb[volitional-よう]+とする」, which often indicates an immediate attempt or being on the verge of an action. The phrase 「～くする」, while part of the grammar point's listed name, is fundamentally different. It is used with *i*-adjectives to turn them into adverbs, signifying making something *more* of that adjective (e.g., 「大きくする」 - to make bigger). It does not apply to the volitional form of verbs in this context of habitual effort.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「Verb[volitional-よう]+にする」, 「～ようになる」 describes a change in ability or the beginning of a new state, focusing on the result rather than the deliberate effort."

            "nuance": "While both involve decision, 「Verb[volitional-よう]+にする」 describes the ongoing effort to *establish* a habit, whereas 「～ことにする」 refers to a specific decision made at a point in time, often establishing a rule or course of action."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The distinction among these similar expressions lies in the nature of the action and intent. 「Verb[volitional-よう]+にする」 emphasizes the ongoing, conscious effort to build a regular habit. 「～ようになる」 highlights a natural change or development in ability or a new state. 「～ことにする」 denotes a clear, often single-point decision to follow a specific course. Lastly, 「Verb[volitional-よう]+とする」 focuses on an immediate attempt or being on the brink of an action, without the implication of forming a lasting habit.",
