details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: teineigo (polite)
  particle-syntactic-function: topic
  particle-pragmatic-function: focus
  usage-context: Used to introduce the topic of discussion, consideration, or information in various contexts,
    ranging from casual conversation to formal academic or business settings.
  function: To indicate the topic or subject of a statement, question, or inquiry.
  nuance: Implies a general discussion 'about' a topic, distinct from 'in relation to' (に関して) or 'concerning
    a specific matter' (の件で).
  colocation: Often appears with verbs like 話す (hanasu, to speak), 考える (kangaeru, to think), 説明する (setsumei
    suru, to explain), and 研究する (kenkyuu suru, to research).
etymology: について is derived from 「に」 (particle indicating location or direction), 「就 (つ)く」 (tsuku, verb
  meaning 'to take a position' or 'to assume'), and 「て」 (te-form, a conjunctive particle). Literally,
  it means 'having taken a position regarding' something, which evolved to mean 'about' or 'concerning'.
  Although the kanji 「就」 exists, については almost always written in hiragana.
writeup: 「について」 is a versatile grammar point used to indicate the topic of a conversation, discussion,
  or written work. It's similar to saying "about," "concerning," or "regarding" in English. It is formed
  by adding 「について」 directly after a noun. For example, you can say 「日本について」 (about Japan) or 「環境問題について」
  (concerning environmental issues). This grammar point can also be used to modify another noun with 「についての」,
  as in 「環境問題についての本」 (a book about environmental issues). It's useful in both formal and informal settings.

    grammar_point: <suggest>:の件で (regarding the matter of)
post_false_friends_writeup: While several expressions share the meaning of 'about' or 'regarding,' it's
  crucial to differentiate their nuances. 「について」 generally introduces a topic for discussion or information.
  「に関して」 is more formal and emphasizes the relationship between two things, whereas 「にとって」 indicates a
  personal perspective or benefit. 「において」 specifies a context, and 「に対して」 indicates direction or opposition.

examples:
  - english: Today's agenda is about the new project.
    japanese:
      - 今日 の 議題 は 新しい プロジェクト {に つい て} です。
      - 今日 の 議題 は 新しい プロジェクト {に つい て} で ござい ます。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 の 議題 は 新しい プロジェクト {に 関し て} です。
        english: Today's agenda is concerning the new project.
        hint: 「に関して」 is more formal and implies a direct relationship or relevance. We're looking for
          a general discussion 'about' the project. The term 「に関して」 can sometimes suggest a more specific
          or delimited area of discussion rather than the broad topic itself.
    scene: A team leader is stating the main topic for the day's meeting.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「です」 or 「で ございます」 maintains a professional and formal tone suitable for a team
      leader addressing a group in a business setting. 「について」 clearly states the agenda's topic without
      implying a specific problem, unlike other alternatives, making it ideal for a neutral topic introduction.
      The nuance here is simply stating the subject matter.
    etymology: 議題 (gida, agenda) refers to the topics to be discussed in a meeting. プロジェクト (purojekuto,
      project) is a common loanword for 'project', derived from English 'project'.
  - english: He is deeply researching Japanese culture.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 日本 の 文化 {に つい て} 深く 研究 し て いる。
      - 彼 は 日本 の 文化 {に つい て} 深く 研究 し て い ます。
    english_literally: He, regarding Japanese culture, is deeply researching.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 日本 の 文化 {に 関し て} 深く 研究 し て いる。
        english: He is deeply researching in relation to Japanese culture.
        hint: While 「に関して」 is also possible, it often emphasizes a more direct, perhaps academic, relationship.
          We're looking for a general statement 'about' his research topic. The term 「に関して」 can sometimes
          suggest a more specific or delimited area of research rather than the broad topic itself.
    scene: You are describing a scholar's specialization to a colleague.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: Using 「について」 in an academic context is appropriate for describing a broad field of study.
      The use of 「している」 (casual) or 「しています」 (polite) allows for flexibility in register while maintaining
      the factual nature of the statement. 「深く 研究 している」 emphasizes the depth of the research, which is
      typical in academic discussions. This phrase highlights the general subject of his extensive study.
    etymology: 文化 (bunka, culture) combines 'bun' (writing, learning) and 'ka' (transform, change), reflecting
      the idea of cultivated practices. 研究 (kenkyuu, research) combines 'ken' (to examine, scrutinize)
      and 'kyuu' (to investigate, seek).

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は AI と 社会 {に 関し て} の 考察 です。
        english: This book is a consideration in relation to AI and society.
        hint: 「に関して」 is often used for topics that imply a direct relationship or connection. Here, we're
          looking for a book generally 'about' a subject. 「に関して」 might be used if the book strictly analyzed
          the *relationship* between AI and society, rather than discussing broader aspects of both.
    scene: A librarian is explaining the content of a new non-fiction book.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「についての 考察」 is a standard way to express that a book is a 'consideration about'
      a specific topic. The choice between 「です」 (polite) and 「だ」 (casual) adjusts the register to the
      context of the conversation. This structure makes it clear that the book delves into the subject
      of AI and its societal implications. The nuance is that the book explores various aspects of AI
      and its societal context.
    etymology: 考察 (kousatsu, consideration) combines 'kou' (to think, consider) and 'satsu' (to inspect,
      examine).
  - english: What do you think about the new teacher?
    japanese:
      - 新しい 先生 {に つい て} どう 思い ます か。

      - 新しい 先生 {に つい て} どう？
    english_literally: Regarding the new teacher, what do you think?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい 先生、どう 思い ます か？
        english: New teacher, what do you think?
        hint: While omitting 「について」 can be casual, it makes the relationship between 'new teacher' and
          'what do you think' less clear. We're looking for a clear expression of asking 'about' someone.
          The omission can sometimes sound abrupt or less specific.
    scene: Two students are chatting casually after class about their new instructor.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The casual variations 「どう 思う？」 and 「どう？」 are typical among friends and young people. 「について」
      is the most natural way to ask for an opinion 'about' someone in this context. The question is straightforward
      and seeks a general impression of the teacher. The nuance is simply asking for a general opinion
      or impression regarding the subject.
    etymology: 先生 (sensei, teacher) means 'one born earlier,' implying seniority or mastery. The kanji
      breakdown is 先 (sen, prior) and 生 (sei, birth/life).
  - english: I want to be a little more careful about my diet.
    japanese:
      - 食 生活 {に つい て} もう 少し 気 を つけ たい。
      - 食 生活 {に つい て} もう 少し 気 を つけ たい です。
    english_literally: Regarding diet, I thought I wanted to know more.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 食 生活 を もう 少し 気 を つけ たい。
        english: I want to be a little more careful with my diet.
        hint: Using 「を」 indicates a direct object. While grammatically correct, 「について」 clearly states
          the topic of what you want to be careful 'about'. 「を」 makes it sound like 'diet' is something
          you physically manipulate, rather than a topic you're reflecting on.
    scene: Someone is making a personal resolution to improve their lifestyle.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: This is a personal reflection, making the casual 「気をつけたい」 appropriate. Adding 「です」 offers
      a slightly polite nuance for internal monologue or if speaking to oneself politely. 「食生活 について」 clearly
      indicates the area of life one wishes to be more mindful of, highlighting it as the subject of one's
      attention and effort.
    etymology: 食生活 (shokuseikatsu, diet/eating habits) combines 'shoku' (food), 'sei' (life), and 'katsu'
      (activity).
  - english: We often discuss his career path as a family.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 進路 {に つい て}、家族 で よく 話し合い ます。
      - 彼 の 進路 {に つい て}、家族 で よく 話し合う。
    english_literally: Regarding his career path, as a family, we often discuss.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 進路 {の 件 で}、家族 で よく 話し合い ます。
        english: Regarding the matter of his career path, we often discuss as a family.
        hint: 「の件で」 refers to a specific 'matter' or 'case', which might be too strong or specific for
          a general family discussion. We're looking for a general discussion 'about' his career path.
          「の件で」 would be more appropriate for a formal, specific agenda item.
    scene: A parent is talking to a friend about their child's future.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「について」 for discussing a 'career path' (進路) is common and natural. The choice between
      「話し合います」 (polite) and 「話し合う」 (casual) depends on the exact relationship with the friend. This sentence
      conveys a supportive and ongoing family discussion about a significant topic. The nuance here is
      a recurring conversation on a subject of mutual interest.
    etymology: 進路 (shinro, career path) combines 'shin' (to advance) and 'ro' (road, path). 話し合う (hanashiau,
      to discuss) combines 'hanashi' (to speak) and 'au' (to meet, combine), implying a mutual discussion,
      literally 'to meet to speak'.
  - english: I wanted to know more about you.
    japanese:
      - あなた {に つい て} もっと 知り たい と 思い まし た。
      - あなた {に つい て} もっと 知り たい と 思っ た。
    english_literally: Regarding you, I thought I wanted to know more.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あなた {に 関し て} もっと 知り たい と 思い まし た。
        english: I wanted to know more in relation to you.
        hint: 「に関して」 would make the sentence sound like you're researching the person as a subject, which
          is too formal and unnatural in a flirty context. We're looking for a personal desire to know
          'about' them. It suggests a more detached, analytical interest.
    scene: During a first date, one person expresses genuine interest in getting to know the other better.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The speaker is a man expressing interest in a woman he likes. The use of 「あなた」 (anata) is
      a polite and direct way to address someone, which in this intimate context, conveys a personal and
      sincere desire to understand her on a deeper level. This directness contributes to the flirty tone.
      「もっと 知りたい」 expresses a desire for deeper knowledge. The nuance of 「について」 here is personal curiosity
      about the entirety of the person, rather than a specific attribute.
    etymology: 知る (shiru, to know) is a fundamental verb. あなた (anata, you) is a common pronoun, its nuance
      changes greatly with context, from formal to intimate depending on usage and context with other
      terms. In this context, it feels intimate and direct, not formal or distant. The desire to 'know
      more' about the person implies a holistic interest, not just factual information, which 「について」 conveys
      well here.
  - english: This document explains about the new system.
    japanese:
      - この 書類 は 新しい 制度 {に つい て} 説明 し て い ます。
      - この 書類 は 新しい 制度 {に つい て} 説明 し て いる。
      - この 書類 は 新しい 制度 {に つい て} ご 説明 し て おり ます。

          - この 書類 は 新しい 制度 {に 関する} 説明 を し て い ます。
        english: This document is providing an explanation related to the new system.
        hint: 「に関する」 can be used but often implies a more official or specific relationship. 「について」 is
          a more general and common way to ask for an explanation 'about'. 「に関する」 might indicate a specific
          section or annex of a larger document that 'relates to' the system.
    scene: A presenter is introducing a technical document to a group of stakeholders.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: In a professional presentation, 「について 説明 しています」 (or its more humble 「ご 説明 しております」) is standard
      for explaining a topic. 「この 書類 は」 clearly indicates the subject providing the explanation. This
      structure is common for technical or business documents, signaling that the document covers various
      aspects of the new system. The use of 「ご説明 しております」 indicates a humble and respectful tone appropriate
      for a formal presentation to stakeholders.
    etymology: 書類 (shorui, document) combines 'sho' (to write) and 'rui' (type, class). 制度 (seido, system)
      combines 'sei' (system, institution) and 'do' (degree, system).
  - english: Could you please explain the payment method in detail?
    japanese:
      - 支払い 方法 {に つい て} 詳しく ご 説明 いただけ ます か。
      - 支払い 方法 {に つい て} 詳しく ご 説明 いただけ ませ ん か。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 支払い 方法 {に 関し て} 詳しく ご 説明 いただけ ます か。
        english: Could you please explain in detail concerning the payment method?
        hint: 「に関して」 is often used for explanations with a stronger sense of relationship or direct relevance.
          「について」 is a more general and common way to ask for an explanation 'about' something. While possible,
          「に関して」 can sometimes imply that the payment method itself is complex or problematic, rather
          than just needing a detailed explanation.
    scene: A customer is politely asking a bank teller for more information about a transaction process.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「について」 with 「詳しく ご説明 いただけますか」 is a very polite and common way to request a detailed
      explanation about a topic in a formal setting. The addition of 「ご」 is a respectful prefix for the
      explanation, and 「いただけますか」 or 「いただけませんか」 are polite forms for making a request. This phrase is commonly
      used to seek comprehensive information on a subject without implying an issue.
    etymology: 支払い (shiharai, payment) comes from the verb 支払う (shiharau, to pay). 方法 (houhou, method)
      combines 'hou' (direction, way) and 'hou' (law, rule).
  - english: Do you have any new information about the other day's accident?
    japanese:

          - 先日 の 事故 {の 件 で} 何 か 新しい 情報 は あり ます か。
        english: Regarding the matter of the other day's accident, is there any new information?
        hint: 「の件で」 often implies a specific 'case' or 'matter' that might require official attention.
          「について」 is a more general inquiry 'about' the accident. 「の件で」 might sound too formal or suggest
          an ongoing official investigation, which may not be the reporter's immediate query.
    scene: A reporter is asking a police officer for updates on a recent incident.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The direct question with 「何か 新しい 情報 は あります か」 is common for inquiring about updates. 「について」
      clearly states the accident as the topic of the information. The casual 「ある？」 can be used if the
      reporter has a more established, informal relationship with the officer. This nuance of 「について」 is
      to simply identify the subject of the inquiry for updates.
    etymology: 先日 (senjitsu, the other day) means 'previous day'. 事故 (jiko, accident) combines 'ji' (matter,
      affair) and 'ko' (happenstance, cause).
  - english: I'd like to ask your opinion about the recent domestic situation.
    japanese:
      - 最近 の 国内 情勢 {に つい て} ご 意見 を 伺い たい です。

          - 最近 の 国内 情勢 {に 関し て} ご 意見 を 伺い たい です。
        english: I'd like to ask your opinion concerning the recent domestic situation.
        hint: 「に関して」 is also a very natural and formal choice for asking opinions on serious topics. However,
          「について」 is slightly more versatile for general topics and opinions. We're looking for an opinion
          'about' the situation. While 「に関して」 is formal, 「について」 feels slightly more conversational and
          open-ended for general opinions.
    scene: A woman asks her male colleague for his professional opinion during a casual coffee break at
      work.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「について」 in a professional setting by a female speaker addresses a male colleague
      with appropriate formality and intellectual curiosity, fitting the serious topic of '国内情勢' (domestic
      situation). 「ご 意見 を 伺い たい です」 is a humble and polite way to solicit an opinion, showing respect
      for the listener's expertise. The casual 「伺いたい」 is used if the context allows for slightly less
      formality. The nuance is to engage in a discussion or solicit a viewpoint on a given subject.
    etymology: 国内 (kokunai, domestic) combines 'koku' (country) and 'nai' (inside). 情勢 (jousei, situation)
      combines 'jou' (circumstance, condition) and 'sei' (power, force, tendency).
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated, 「について」 is highly adaptable across various registers and contexts,
  from professional discussions to casual conversations, serving consistently to introduce the topic at
  hand. Its use emphasizes the subject of focus, making it a fundamental particle for clear communication.
