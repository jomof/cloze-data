    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てでも」 is formed by combining the 「て」-form of a verb with the particle 「でも」. The 「て」-form connects actions or states, while 「でも」 adds the nuance of \"even if\" or \"no matter what.\"",
    "writeup": "「てでも」 combines the 「て」 form of a verb with the particle 「でも」. It expresses a **strong determination** to do something, regardless of the difficulty or consequences. Think of it as saying, \"even if I have to (do A), I will...\" It emphasizes the speaker's resolve. Because 「てでも」 expresses such a strong will, it often appears in sentences containing phrases expressing desire or intent, such as 「ほしい」, 「たい」, and 「ようと思う」. While considered somewhat informal due to the use of 「てでも」 instead of the expected 「ても」, the construction of 「て」-form plus an adverbial particle is common for emphasis or comparison, as seen with 「ては」 in patterns like 「てはいけない」 or 「てはだめ」.",
