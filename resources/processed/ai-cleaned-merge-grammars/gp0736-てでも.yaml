    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed by combining the -て form of a verb with the particle でも. The -て form connects actions or expresses a reason, while でも adds the nuance of \"even if\" or \"no matter what\" to emphasize the speaker's determination.",
    "writeup": "「てでも」 combines the 「て」 conjunction with the adverbial particle 「でも」. It conveys the meaning of \"no matter what\" or \"even if I have to (do something)\". When connected to verbs, 「てでも」 emphasizes that even if something needs to be done, it *will* be done. It expresses a strong determination by the speaker to do something, regardless of the consequences or difficulty involved.\n\nBecause 「てでも」 expresses strong will, it is often found in sentences including other phrases indicating desire or intent, such as 「ほしい」, 「たい」, and 「ようと思う」.\n\nWhile 「てでも」 can be considered fairly casual due to the 「て」 form rather than the expected 「ても」, the construction of 「て」-form partnered with an adverbial particle is quite common and often marks emphasis or comparison. This is frequently seen with 「ては」 in patterns like 「てはいけない」 or 「てはだめ」.",
