    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てでも」 is formed by combining the 「て」-form of a verb with the particle 「でも」. The 「て」-form connects actions or states, while 「でも」 adds the nuance of \"even if\" or \"no matter what.\" Historically, 「でも」 evolved from 「とて」 (even) and 「も」 (also, even). The combination of 「て」-form, which denotes a cause, reason, or condition, with 「でも」, emphasizing an extreme case, creates the strong sense of 'even if that extreme condition holds, I will do it.' This structure highlights the speaker's resolve to push through difficult circumstances to achieve a desired outcome.",
    "writeup": "「てでも」 combines the 「て」 form of a verb with the particle 「でも」. It expresses a **strong determination** to do something, regardless of the difficulty or consequences. Think of it as saying, \"even if I have to (do A), I will...\" It emphasizes the speaker's resolve. Because 「てでも」 expresses such a strong will, it often appears in sentences containing phrases expressing desire or intent, such as 「ほしい」, 「たい」, and 「ようと思う」. While considered somewhat informal due to the use of 「てでも」 instead of the expected 「ても」, the construction of 「て」-form plus an adverbial particle is common for emphasis or comparison, as seen with 「ては」 in patterns like 「てはいけない」 or 「てはだめ」. This grammar point conveys a much stronger sense of resolve and a willingness to overcome obstacles than a simple 「ても」.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "While 「ようが〜まいが」 also expresses 'no matter what,' it focuses on contrasting two possibilities, whereas 「てでも」 emphasizes the speaker's resolve despite difficulty."

            "meaning": "Even though; even if; even when; also",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「にしても」 can mean 'even if,' but it often implies a degree of surprise or concession. 「てでも」 is more about determination and willingness to overcome obstacles."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「てでも」 highlights the speaker's strong will to achieve something, even if it requires significant effort or sacrifice. 「ようが〜まいが」 presents alternatives without necessarily emphasizing the speaker's determination. 「にしても」 introduces a sense of surprise or acknowledgment of a situation, which is different from the resolve expressed by 「てでも」.",
