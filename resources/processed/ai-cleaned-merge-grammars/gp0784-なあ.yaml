It's an emphatic form of 「な」 and often carries a sense of longing or hoping. It's considered informal and is **more commonly used by males**. It's similar to saying \"I wonder...\" or \"I wish...\" in English, but with a stronger emotional tone. It can also be used rhetorically, not necessarily seeking an answer.",
