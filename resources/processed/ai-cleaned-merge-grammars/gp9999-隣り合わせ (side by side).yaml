details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  nuance: Can imply a sense of inevitability, shared destiny, or inseparable connection, extending beyond
    mere physical adjacency. It is used for both positive and negative connotations.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a predicate, adverb, or attributive modifier.
  temporal-flow: Can indicate simultaneous or concurrent existence/occurrence of two things or concepts.
etymology: The expression {隣り合わせ} is a compound of 「隣り」 (tonari), meaning "next door" or "neighbor," and
  「合わせる」 (awaseru), meaning "to join," "to combine," or "to face each other." The 「り」 in 「隣り」 is an older
  form, often seen in adverbial or connecting usages of verbs and nouns. The combination vividly portrays
  not just physical adjacency, but also situations where things or concepts are so closely associated
  that they appear to be "joined at the hip" or co-occur inevitably.
writeup: |-
  {隣り合わせ} is a versatile phrase used to describe situations where two or more things, concepts, or people are in close proximity, either physically or metaphorically. Beyond simple adjacency, it often carries the nuance of an inseparable connection, shared circumstances, or a coincidental, often inevitable, co-occurrence. It can be used in both positive and negative contexts, implying a natural pairing or a close encounter with something.

  While it can describe physical closeness, such as two buildings standing {隣り合わせ}, its more profound usage lies in describing abstract concepts. For instance, joy and sorrow might be {隣り合わせ} in life, or danger and opportunity could be {隣り合わせ} in a challenging situation. This phrase suggests that the elements are not just near each other but are intimately linked or found together as a common pairing.

  The grammatical formation typically involves a noun followed by と or に, and then {隣り合わせ} だ/です. It can also appear as an attributive modifier (Noun の {隣り合わせ}) or an adverbial phrase ({隣り合わせ} に Verb). The choice of particle (と vs. に) can subtly change the nuance, with と often implying a mutual or paired relationship, and に indicating adjacency to a specific point or situation. However, in many abstract contexts, they are interchangeable.
false_friends:
  - term: 隣
    meaning: next door, neighbor, immediate vicinity
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「隣」 simply indicates physical proximity to a person or object. 「隣り合わせ」 emphasizes a more intimate
      connection, often implying shared circumstances, fate, or an inseparable pairing, not just simple
      adjacency.
    grammar_point: 隣 (immediately next to)
  - term: 一緒に
    meaning: together, with (implies joint action or presence)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「一緒に」 denotes performing an action or being present *with* someone or something. It implies
      intentional togetherness or shared activity. 「隣り合わせ」 describes a state of being next to each other,
      often implying an inherent connection or co-occurrence, regardless of joint action.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:一緒に (together)
  - term: 同時に
    meaning: simultaneously, at the same time
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「同時に」 strictly refers to temporal simultaneity, meaning events happen at the exact same moment.
      While {隣り合わせ} can describe temporal closeness, it also covers physical or conceptual closeness and
      often implies more than just happening at the same time—it implies a close relationship or shared
      fate, rather than mere timing.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:同時に (simultaneously)
  - term: 隣接
    meaning: adjacency, contiguity (more formal and technical term)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「隣接」 is a more formal, technical term typically used for physical or spatial adjacency (e.g.,
      adjacent buildings, territories). 「隣り合わせ」 is more versatile, encompassing both physical and abstract/metaphorical
      "side-by-sideness" and often carries a nuance of inherent connection or shared fate, not just formal
      proximity.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:隣接 (adjacency)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share some semantic overlap with {隣り合わせ}, their specific
  nuances differ. Remember that {隣り合わせ} often conveys a sense of inherent connection, shared circumstances,
  or inevitable co-occurrence, extending beyond simple physical adjacency or temporal simultaneity.

  can sometimes depend on whether the speaker perceives the elements as mutually associated or one being
  adjacent to the other, but often these distinctions are subtle and interchangeable in everyday usage.
