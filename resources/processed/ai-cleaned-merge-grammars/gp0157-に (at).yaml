    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 is used to precisely indicate when an action or event takes place. It acts as a temporal marker, answering the question \"When?\" It is essential for specifying exact times, dates, days of the week, and fixed events. \n\n**Key Usage Rules:**\n*   **Use 「に」 with specific times:** For instance, 「７時に」 (at 7 o'clock), 「９時半に」 (at 9:30).\n*   **Use 「に」 with specific dates:** Like 「４月１日に」 (on April 1st), 「５月５日に」 (on May 5th).\n*   **Use 「に」 with specific days of the week:** Such as 「月曜日に」 (on Monday), 「金曜日に」 (on Friday).\n*   **Use 「に」 with fixed events or holidays:** For example, 「クリスマスに」 (on Christmas), 「誕生日パーティーに」 (at the birthday party).\n\n**Important Exclusions:**\nHowever, 「に」 cannot be used with time expressions that are not specific, such as 「今日」 (today), 「明日」 (tomorrow), 「昨日」 (yesterday), 「来週」 (next week), 「今月」 (this month), 「最近」 (recently), or 「いつも」 (always). If a time expression can be uniquely identified by a number or a fixed calendar point, 「に」 can be used. If it's a relative or general time expression, 「に」 is typically omitted.",
