jlpt: N3
details:
  register: casual
  usage-context: General daily conversation
  function: Indicates an action or state is incomplete or on the verge of occurring
  nuance: Implies a "suspended" state, either mid-action or just before initiation. Its interpretation
    varies depending on whether the accompanying verb describes a momentary or ongoing action.
  colocation: Often appears as part of a noun phrase, e.g., Verb stem + かけ + の + Noun.
etymology: The grammar point 「かけ」 comes from the verb 「掛ける」 (kakeru), which means "to hang," "to suspend,"
  or "to start doing something." The nuance is that something is "suspended" in the process of happening,
  or is partially completed.
writeup: |-
  「かけ」 functions as a suffix indicating that an action or state is unfinished, about to start, or on the verge of occurring. It is derived from the verb 「掛ける」 (kakeru), meaning "to hang" or "to suspend." This nuance is key: think of it as something 'suspended' in the middle of a process, like a photo capturing a moment between start and finish. It attaches to the stem (連用形, ren'yōkei) of verbs. While 「かけ」 primarily functions like a noun and can be followed by the particle 「の」 when modifying another noun, or 「だ」 at the end of a sentence, the verb 「掛ける」 itself may occasionally be used to convey a similar meaning. The interpretation of 「かけ」 depends on the verb it is paired with:

  *   With verbs denoting momentary actions (which cannot be 'half' done), 「かけ」 conveys that the action was 'on the verge of' happening. For example, 「死にかけ」 (shini-kake) means "on the verge of dying."
  *   With verbs describing ongoing actions, 「かけ」 implies that the action is 'in the process' of being done, or 'half-done.' For example, 「食べかけ」 (tabe-kake) means "half-eaten."

  - term: たて
    meaning: Freshly ~ed, Just ~ed
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「かけ」 which means "half done", 「たて」 indicates something has just been done, so it's
      completed.
    grammar_point: たて (freshly done)
  - term: るところだ
    meaning: About to, On the verge of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both 「かけ」 and 「るところだ」 can mean "about to", 「かけ」 also covers "half-done" and "unfinished"
      states.
    grammar_point: るところだ (about to)
  - term: はじめる
    meaning: To start; To begin to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「はじめる」 simply means to start something, while 「かけ」 implies the action has been started but
      not finished or is on the verge of starting.
    grammar_point: はじめる (to start doing)
  - term: だす
    meaning: To suddenly begin; to start doing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「だす」 means to start something suddenly, whereas 「かけ」 suggests an ongoing state or something
      nearing completion.
    grammar_point: だす (to suddenly begin)
  - term: 寸前
    meaning: Just before, On the verge of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「かけ」 and 「寸前」 express being on the verge of something, 「寸前」 emphasizes an immediate,
      critical point right before an event, while 「かけ」 can describe a more general state of being incomplete
      or near completion, especially for ongoing actions.
    grammar_point: '<suggest>: 寸前 (just before)'
  - term: 食べ残し
    meaning: Leftovers, uneaten food
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「食べ残し」 refers specifically to food that has been left over or uneaten, often implying it's
      no longer being consumed or is discarded. 「食べかけ」 implies food that is currently in the process of
      being eaten or has been only partially consumed and might still be intended for consumption.
    grammar_point: '<suggest>: 食べ残し (leftovers)'
  - term: てしまう
    meaning: to do something completely; to do something by accident; to do something regrettably/unfortunately
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「てしまう」 indicates an action has been completed, often with a nuance of completion, regret,
      or accidental finish, which is the opposite of 「かけ」 indicating an action is unfinished or on the
      verge.
    grammar_point: てしまう・ちゃう (completion・regret・accident)
  - term: ている
    meaning: Is, Am, Are (~ing); state of being; has done
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ている」 describes an action that is currently ongoing, 「かけ」 specifically denotes that
      the action is *incomplete* or *on the verge of starting/finishing*, implying a temporary or suspended
      state, whereas 「ている」 can be for simple ongoing processes without the nuance of incompleteness.
    grammar_point: ている (resultant and ongoing state)
  - term: たばかり
    meaning: Just did; something just happened
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「たばかり」 indicates an action has just been completed very recently, directly contrasting with
      「かけ」 which signifies an action that is unfinished or on the verge of beginning/ending.
    grammar_point: たばかり (just did)
post_false_friends_writeup: Be mindful of the subtle differences between 「かけ」 and similar expressions.
  「たて」 signifies a recently completed action, the opposite of 「かけ」. While 「るところだ」 shares the sense of
  'about to happen', 「かけ」 also includes the idea of something being half-finished. 「はじめる」 and 「だす」 simply
  mean to start something, lacking the nuance of incompleteness that 「かけ」 provides. Furthermore, `寸前`
  focuses on the immediate, critical point before an event, whereas `かけ` allows for a broader sense of
  being near completion or incomplete. `食べ残し` specifically denotes actual leftovers, distinct from `食べかけ`,
  which implies a meal still in progress. Similarly, 「てしまう」 indicates an action's completion, contrasting
  with 「かけ」's incompleteness, and 「たばかり」 emphasizes very recent completion. While 「ている」 describes an ongoing
  action, it lacks the specific nuance of being unfinished or on the verge that 「かけ」 conveys.

    japanese:
      - この {食べかけ} の パン、まだ 食べ られ ます か？
      - この {食べかけ} の パン、まだ 食べ られる？

          - この {食べ 残し} の パン、まだ 食べ られ ます か？
        english: Can I still eat this leftover bread?
        hint: 「食べ残し」 refers to food that has been abandoned or left over, not necessarily something that
          is still in the process of being eaten. We're looking for 'half-eaten'.
    scene: A friend asks if they can finish a piece of bread someone else started, noticing it's partially
      consumed.

    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The casual tone and question about consuming something already started is common among close
      friends. The use of 「食べかけ」 highlights the incomplete state of eating, suggesting it was paused rather
      than abandoned.
    etymology: The term 「食べかけ」 itself is a compound formed by the verb stem of 「食べる」 (taberu, to eat)
      and the suffix 「かけ」. This structure inherently conveys the meaning of an action that has begun but
      is not yet complete. This particular construction reflects the broader Japanese linguistic tendency
      to create highly nuanced compound expressions that precisely describe states of being or processes,
      making it distinct from more general terms for 'leftovers' like 「食べ残し」 which denote completion or
      abandonment rather than a state of ongoing consumption.

        english: He put his leftover coffee on the desk.
        hint: 「飲み残し」 implies the drink is abandoned or no longer desired, while 「飲みかけ」 suggests it's merely
          paused. We're looking for 'half-drunk' (in progress).
    scene: A busy office worker, needing to attend to something else, places his coffee down mid-consumption.

    setting: professional
    etymology: The expression 「飲みかけ」 combines the verb stem of 「飲む」 (nomu, to drink) with the suffix 「かけ」.
      Similar to 「食べかけ」, it precisely describes a beverage that has been started but is not yet finished.
      This is distinct from 「飲み残し」 (nominokoshi), which means 'leftover drink' and implies it may no longer
      be intended for consumption. The construction showcases how Japanese can specify the status of an
      item in relation to an action, emphasizing its 'in-progress' state.

    speaker_gender: female
    etymology: 「読みかけ」 is formed from the verb stem of 「読む」 (yomu, to read) and the suffix 「かけ」. It specifically
      denotes a book that has been started but is not yet completed, implying that the reading process
      was merely paused rather than abandoned. This precise articulation of an 'in-progress' state is
      a hallmark of how Japanese compounds verb stems with suffixes to convey nuanced meanings related
      to the completion or commencement of actions.

    etymology: The term 「書きかけ」 combines the verb stem of 「書く」 (kaku, to write) with the suffix 「かけ」. It
      refers to a written piece (like a letter or document) that has been started but is not yet finished.
      This construction is a prime example of how Japanese grammar allows for concise expressions of a
      state of action being 'midway' or 'in progress,' highlighting that the writing process has commenced
      but awaits completion.

    scene: A compassionate man discovers a severely injured and frail cat by the roadside.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    etymology: 「死にかけ」 is formed from the verb stem of 「死ぬ」 (shinu, to die) and the suffix 「かけ」. For momentary
      verbs like 'to die', 「かけ」 conveys the meaning of being 'on the verge of' or 'about to'. It implies
      a state of being extremely close to death, rather than a prolonged process. This usage highlights
      the versatility of 「かけ」 in applying to both instantaneous and continuous actions, adapting its nuance
      accordingly.

    etymology: 「壊れかけ」 combines the verb stem of 「壊れる」 (kawareru, to break/collapse) with the suffix 「かけ」.
      It signifies a state where something is already in the process of breaking or is very unstable,
      implying it is 'about to collapse' or 'on the verge of breaking completely.' This construction clearly
      distinguishes it from simply 'something that might break' (壊れそうなもの), conveying an ongoing state
      of deterioration.

        english: Just when I was about to go out, the phone rang.
        hint: 「出かけるところだった」 emphasizes being on the verge of leaving. 「出かけかけ」 highlights being physically
          in the process of leaving, or 'halfway out the door' when interrupted.
    scene: Someone is just about to leave their house when an unexpected call comes in.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: The use of 「出かけかけ」 here, derived from 「出かける」 (to go out) and 「かけ」, implies being literally
      'halfway out the door' or in the very early stage of leaving when an interruption occurs. This is
      more specific than simply 'about to leave' (出かけようとしていた時), which focuses on the intention rather
      than the physical state of departure. This precise nuance of being caught mid-action is characteristic
      of 「かけ」 when applied to verbs of movement.
    etymology: The expression 「出かけかけ」 is formed from the verb stem of 「出かける」 (dekakeru, to go out) and
      the suffix 「かけ」. While less common than other forms of 「かけ」, it emphasizes being in the very initial
      phase of leaving, or literally 'halfway out the door.' This highlights the grammar point's ability
      to describe a state of being interrupted or suspended during the commencement of an action, making
      it more nuanced than a simple statement of intent to leave.

        english: He tried to say something, but stopped.
        hint: 「言おうとした」 focuses on the intention or attempt to speak. 「言いかけ」 means he actually started
          speaking but didn't finish, implying an interrupted action.
    scene: A person hesitates, opening their mouth to speak but then changing their mind.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    etymology: 「言いかけ」 is formed from the verb stem of 「言う」 (iu, to say) and the suffix 「かけ」. It means
      to 'begin to say something but not finish it', implying the speech was interrupted or stopped midway.
      This usage vividly captures the moment of hesitation or incomplete utterance, distinguishing it
      from merely 'intending to say something' (言おうとした) or 'starting to speak' (言い始めた), by emphasizing
      the uncompleted nature of the action.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「かけ」 can be used with both continuous verbs (like 食べる,
  読む, 作る, 書く, 飲む) to indicate something is 'half-done' or 'in progress', and with momentary verbs (like
  死ぬ, 壊れる, 生まれる, 始まる, 動く, 出かける, 言う) to convey being 'on the verge of' or 'just beginning' an action. Pay
  attention to the context and the nature of the verb to grasp the precise nuance. While many verbs can
  be paired with 「かけ」, this grammatical pattern is particularly effective for describing states of suspension
  or transition.
