jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: suffix
  register: casual
  usage-context: General use
etymology: The suffix 「さ」 is believed to have originated from the kanji 差 (sa), meaning "distinction."
  It was initially used to emphasize the distinctive features of something. While less common in modern
  Japanese, さ can also follow the dictionary form of verbs to highlight a specific point in time, a usage
  primarily found in older, more poetic language.
writeup: 'The suffix 「さ」 in Japanese is attached to the stem of い-adjectives and な-adjectives. This transforms
  the adjective into a noun that represents the **degree** or **extent** of that quality. Think of it
  as adding "-ness" or "-ity" in English: sweetness, tallness, beauty, etc. Although less frequent, 「さ」
  can also follow the dictionary form of verbs in poetic contexts to pinpoint a specific moment or instance.
  This use is primarily found in older, more literary Japanese.'

  - term: み
    meaning: ~ness; Used to indicate conditions or nature
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「さ」 generally refers to the *degree* or *measurable extent* of a quality (e.g., 長さ for
      length, 重さ for weight), 「み」 often describes the *nature*, *condition*, or *inherent quality* itself,
      sometimes with a nuance of feeling or deeper implication (e.g., 深み for profoundness, 悲しみ for sadness).
      For example, 「深さ」 (fukasa) means 'depth' as a measurement, while 「深み」 (fukami) means 'depth' as
      in 'profoundness' or 'richness'.
    grammar_point: み (suffix inherent quality)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between 「さ」 and 「み」, consider whether you are emphasizing
  the quantifiable measure or extent of something versus its inherent quality or state. If you're talking
  about the amount, size, or a measurable characteristic, use 「さ」. If you're describing an inherent condition,
  a subjective feeling, or a deeper quality that isn't necessarily quantifiable, 「み」 is often more appropriate.

        english: That mountain is tall, so I am surprised.

      height, emphasizing its degree. This is a common and natural way to express a quantifiable quality.

      emphasizing its quality. This reflective statement might be made to oneself or in a general observation.

      meaning 'quietness' or 'stillness'.

      or very formal/poetic speech, emphasizing the precise, emotional moment of departure. It is not
      common in modern everyday Japanese.
    etymology: This usage of 「さ」 after a verb is a remnant of classical Japanese, where 「さ」 could function
      as a nominalizing suffix, often indicating a point or instance, similar to 「ところ」 or 「とき」 but with
      a more emphatic or emotional tone.
