    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないで」 is derived from the negative form of a verb, 「ない」, combined with the particle 「で」. The auxiliary verb 「ない」 indicates negation. The particle 「で」, in this construction, functions to connect the negative verbal phrase, forming a direct or implied prohibition. It's akin to stating 'by not doing (X)' or 'in the state of not doing (X)', leading to the nuance of 'please do not (X)'. The addition of 「ください」 further formalizes this request, making it a polite command.",
    "writeup": "「ないで」 is a grammatical construct used to express a request or gentle command **not** to do something. While 「ないでください」 provides a more polite form, 「ないで」 on its own is frequently employed in casual contexts, particularly among close friends and family. It functions as a direct statement or a mild prohibition. Grammatically, this structure combines the auxiliary verb 「ない」, indicating negation, with the particle 「で」. To form it, attach 「ないで」 to the **negative stem** of the verb you wish to negate. The sentence often concludes directly with 「ないで」.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish this usage from the 「ないで」 that means 'without doing (A), (B)', which connects two clauses. This grammar point refers to the terminal usage as a request or command, where the sentence ends with 「ないで」 or 「ないでください」.",

            "term": "ないで",
            "meaning": "Without doing; Not ~ and ~",
            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "When used to mean \"without doing\", 「ないで」 connects two actions. For example, 「朝ご飯を食べないで学校へ行った」 means \"I went to school without eating breakfast.\" This 「ないで」 serves as a conjunctive particle, linking two clauses, and does not function as a request."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "It's crucial to differentiate between 「ないで」 as a request and 「ないで」 indicating 'without doing'. Context is key: if it stands alone as a gentle command, it's likely a request. If it connects two clauses, it probably means 'without doing'. Pay attention to whether the phrase concludes the sentence or introduces another action.",
