    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないで」 is derived from the negative form of a verb, 「ない」, combined with the particle 「で」. The auxiliary verb 「ない」 indicates negation. The particle 「で」, in this construction, functions to connect the negative verbal phrase, forming a direct or implied prohibition. It's akin to stating 'by not doing (X)' or 'in the state of not doing (X)', leading to the nuance of 'please do not (X)'. The addition of 「ください」 further formalizes this request, making it a polite command.",
    "writeup": "「ないで」 is a grammatical construct used to express a request or gentle command **not** to do something. While 「ないでください」 provides a more polite form, 「ないで」 on its own is frequently employed in casual contexts, particularly among close friends and family. It functions as a direct statement or a mild prohibition. Grammatically, this structure combines the auxiliary verb 「ない」, indicating negation, with the particle 「で」. To form it, attach 「ないで」 to the **negative stem** of the verb you wish to negate. The sentence often concludes directly with 「ないで」.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish this usage from the 「ないで」 that means 'without doing (A), (B)', which connects two clauses. This grammar point refers to the terminal usage as a request or command, where the sentence ends with 「ないで」 or 「ないでください」.",

            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "When used to mean \"without doing\", 「ないで」 connects two actions. For example, 「朝ご飯を食べないで学校へ行った」 means \"I went to school without eating breakfast.\" This 「ないで」 serves as a conjunctive particle, linking two clauses, and does not function as a request."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "It's crucial to differentiate between 「ないで」 as a request and 「ないで」 indicating 'without doing'. Context is key: if it stands alone as a gentle command, it's likely a request. If it connects two clauses, it probably means 'without doing'. Pay attention to whether the phrase concludes the sentence or introduces another action.",

            "nuance": "This direct command 「立ち止まないで」 (don't stop) is a common instruction given by figures of authority, such as teachers, in school environments. It is firm yet not overly harsh, conveying an expectation of obedience. The lack of 「ください」 makes it more direct. While it can be casual, in this context from a teacher, it is a straightforward instruction rather than an informal plea.",
            "etymology": "The phrase 「立ち止まらないで」 combines 「立ち止まる」 (to stop) with the negative request form. This construction is common in directives, emphasizing the act of not stopping in a particular location, suggesting flow or continuation. The casualness suits an immediate, on-the-spot instruction to students to keep moving or clear the way, reflecting the dynamic nature of a busy school hallway. The nuance here is more about directing movement rather than strict prohibition, making it appropriate for a teacher guiding students."

This phrase is a common way to express a warning or prohibition, especially in contexts of caution or safety. The nuance of 「ついていかないで」 is a gentle yet firm directive, often used by parents or guardians to convey important safety instructions without being overly harsh.

            "etymology": "The phrase 「そんなにお金を使わないで」 integrates 「そんなに」 (that much, so much) with 「お金を使う」 (to spend money) in the negative request form.

            "etymology": "The expression 「そんなにたくさん飲まないで」 combines 「そんなにたくさん」 (such a large amount) with the negative request form of 「飲む」 (to drink). This construction effectively conveys concern or a mild warning about excessive consumption. The use of 「そんなにたくさん」 highlights the quantity, adding a layer of emphasis to the speaker's concern.

            "etymology": "The phrase 「そんなに走らないでよ」 combines the intensifying adverb 「そんなに」 (so much) with the negative request form of 「走る」 (to run), adding the sentence-final particle 「よ」. The 「よ」 particle adds emphasis, assertion, or a gentle emotional appeal, making the request softer and more intimate.

The phrase 「くださいね」 makes it a soft request.",
