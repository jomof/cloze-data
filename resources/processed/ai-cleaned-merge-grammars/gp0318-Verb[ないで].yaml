    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないで」 is derived from the negative form of a verb 「ない」 combined with the particle 「で」. While 「で」 has various uses, here it functions to connect the negative verb to the rest of the sentence, creating a sense of request or prohibition.",
    "writeup": "「ないで」 is a grammatical construct used to express a request or gentle command **not** to do something. While 「ないでください」 provides a more polite form, 「ないで」 on its own is frequently employed in casual contexts, particularly among close friends and family. It functions as a direct statement or a mild prohibition. Grammatically, this structure combines the auxiliary verb 「ない」, indicating negation, with the particle 「で」. To form it, attach 「ないで」 to the **negative stem** of the verb you wish to negate. The sentence often concludes directly with 「ないで」.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish this usage from the 「ないで」 that means 'without doing (A), (B)', which connects two clauses. This grammar point refers to the terminal usage as a request or command.",

            "nuance": "This direct command 「立ち止まないで」 (don't stop) is a common instruction given by figures of authority, such as teachers, in school environments. It is firm yet not overly harsh, conveying an expectation of obedience. The lack of 「ください」 makes it more direct. 「立ち止まる」 (to stop) uses N4 kanji."
