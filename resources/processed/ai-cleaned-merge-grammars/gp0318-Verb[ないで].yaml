    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないで」 is derived from the negative form of a verb 「ない」 combined with the particle 「で」. While 「で」 has various uses, here it functions to connect the negative verb to the rest of the sentence, creating a sense of request or prohibition.",
    "writeup": "「ないで」 is a way to express \"please don't do (A)\" in a casual manner. While 「ないでください」 is a more polite version, 「ないで」 on its own is common among close friends and family. It essentially acts as a simple statement or a gentle command. Grammatically, it combines the auxiliary verb 「ない」 with the particle 「で」. To use this, attach it to the negative stem of the verb you want someone to avoid doing. This form is mostly used in casual speech.",
