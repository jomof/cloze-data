        "Verb (negative stem) + ないで": "Expresses a request or command not to do something."

    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないで」 is derived from the negative form of a verb 「ない」 combined with the particle 「で」. While 「で」 has various uses, here it functions to connect the negative verb to the rest of the sentence, creating a sense of request or prohibition.",
    "writeup": "「ないで」 is a grammatical construct used to express a request or gentle command **not** to do something. While 「ないでください」 provides a more polite form, 「ないで」 on its own is frequently employed in casual contexts, particularly among close friends and family. It functions as a direct statement or a mild prohibition. Grammatically, this structure combines the auxiliary verb 「ない」, indicating negation, with the particle 「で」. To form it, attach 「ないで」 to the **negative stem** of the verb you wish to negate. The sentence often concludes directly with 「ないで」.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish this usage from the 「ないで」 that means 'without doing (A), (B)', which connects two clauses. This grammar point refers to the terminal usage as a request or command.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene sets up a direct, firm command from a teacher, making the softer request of 「ないで」 more appropriate than a strict prohibition. While \"寝てはいけない\" is possible, \"寝ないで\" is often used to convey a direct, authoritative instruction in this context without being overly harsh."

            "speaker_age": "older",
            "nuance": "This usage is a direct, firm command from a position of authority, common in a school setting. The direct 「ないで」 is strong despite its lack of 「ください」. The phrase 「そこの生徒」 is a common way for a teacher to address a specific student in a commanding manner."

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies a parental warning, where a gentle but firm request using 「ないで」 is more natural than a strict prohibition. The addition of 「大事なことよ」 emphasizes the importance without resorting to a strong prohibition, fitting a mother's softer approach."
