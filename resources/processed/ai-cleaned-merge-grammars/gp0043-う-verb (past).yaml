    "etymology": "The past tense conjugation of verbs in Japanese, including う-verbs (also known as godan verbs), is formed by altering the verb's ending and adding either た (casual) or ました (polite). The specific change to the verb ending depends on the final sound of the dictionary form of the verb. Historically, the た form evolved from the て form, which is used to connect verbs, reflecting a completed action or state.",
    "writeup": "To create the past tense form of う-verbs (also known as godan verbs) in Japanese, you need to modify the final kana of the verb stem before adding た (casual) or ました (polite). The specific sound change depends on the last kana of the verb. Note that some verbs ending in う will change to った.",
