    "etymology": "The past tense conjugation of verbs in Japanese, including う-verbs (also known as godan verbs), is formed by altering the verb's ending and adding either た (casual) or ました (polite). The specific change to the verb ending depends on the final sound of the dictionary form of the verb. Historically, the た form evolved from the て form, which is used to connect verbs, reflecting a completed action or state.",
    "writeup": "The past tense of う-verbs (godan verbs) is formed by modifying the verb's final kana before attaching the auxiliary verb た (casual) or ました (polite). For the casual form, the conjugation involves specific sound changes, known as 音便 (onbin). For example, verbs ending in う, つ, る often become った (促音便 - sokuonbin); verbs ending in ぬ, ぶ, む become んだ (撥音便 - hatsuonbin); and verbs ending in く, ぐ become いた or いだ respectively (イ音便 - ionbin). The instances where た becomes だ are due to a historical sound change for smoother pronunciation, not the auxiliary verb だ. In contrast, the polite past form, ending in ました, generally involves a more consistent change of the verb's final う-sound to an い-sound before adding ました. The auxiliary た, when affixed to verbs, can convey three core meanings: past action (\"did/was\"), completion (\"done\"), or a resulting state that continues (\"has been done\"). Be aware that some う-verbs are irregular and do not follow these standard patterns.",

Adding 「よ」 to the humble form makes it slightly more emphatic."
