details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General use. Implies a subtle reservation or qualification even while affirming possibility.
  function: Weak affirmation; concession.
  nuance: Often used to hedge or soften a statement, suggesting something is possible but perhaps not
    ideal, easy, or the main point.
  colocation: Often followed by phrases indicating a slight contradiction or additional condition (e.g.,
    けど, が, わけでもない).
etymology: This grammar point is a double negative. 「こと」 refers to a situation or a thing. 「ない」 means
  'not exist' or 'not be'. Therefore, 「ないことはない」 literally means 'there isn't a situation where something
  does not exist', which implies possibility or a qualified affirmation. This structure evolved to allow
  for nuanced expressions of partial agreement or reluctant possibility.
writeup: |-
  「ないことはない」 is an expression that employs a double negative to convey a weak affirmation. It translates to 'it's not impossible', 'it doesn't mean that it isn't', or 'it is possible, but with reservations'. This structure can be used with the negative form of verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns.

  At its core, the phrase functions as a qualified affirmative. While the literal translation suggests the absence of a negative state, the practical implication is often a reluctant or partial acknowledgment of something. For instance, if someone says 「食べられないことはない」 (taberarenai koto wa nai), it means 'it's not that I *cannot* eat it', implying 'I *can* eat it, but perhaps I don't particularly want to, or it's not my preference.'

  **Usage Considerations:**
  *   **Nuance of Hesitation**: The double negative inherently creates a softer, more indirect statement compared to a direct affirmative. It often expresses a lack of enthusiasm, a concession, or a polite refusal.
  *   **Potential Form**: This grammar point frequently appears with verbs in the potential form (e.g., 「できないことはない」). When used this way, it often carries a nuance of 'it's not like I *can't* (do something)', sometimes implying a lack of effort or a half-hearted attitude towards the action.
  *   **Context is Key**: The precise meaning of 「ないことはない」 heavily relies on the context and the speaker's tone. It's crucial to pay attention to the surrounding phrases and the speaker's implied intent.
false_friends:
  - term: というわけではない
    meaning: It is not that, It doesn't mean that, It is not always the case
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「というわけではない」 directly negates a general statement or a presumed truth. Unlike 「ないことはない」, it
      does not imply a possibility, but rather clarifies that something is not necessarily true or the
      case.
    grammar_point: というわけではない (not necessarily)
  - term: はずがない
    meaning: Hardly possible, Cannot be, Highly unlikely, Improbable
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「はずがない」 expresses strong disbelief or impossibility, indicating that something absolutely
      cannot be true. In sharp contrast, 「ないことはない」 acknowledges at least a slight possibility, even if
      reluctant.
    grammar_point: はずがない (logical impossibility)
  - term: そうもない
    meaning: Very unlikely to, Does not seem that, Does not appear that
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「そうもない」 suggests a very low probability based on observation or current circumstances, implying
      an action or event is unlikely to occur. This differs from 「ないことはない」, which affirms the possibility,
      even if it might be difficult or undesirable.
    grammar_point: そうもない (very unlikely to)
  - term: はない
    meaning: There is not ~ that is not/does not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This structure is also a double negative, but it emphasizes completeness or universality,
      meaning 'there isn't a single X that doesn't Y'. 「ないことはない」, on the other hand, focuses more on a
      specific possibility or a limited affirmation, often with a nuance of concession.
    grammar_point: はない (no exceptions)
  - term: とは限らない
    meaning: Not necessarily so, Is not always true, There is no guarantee that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「とは限らない」 signifies that something is not always true or that there's no guarantee, often implying
      exceptions. While it shares a similar function of qualifying a statement, 「ないことはない」 specifically
      emphasizes the existence of a possibility despite apparent negation, often with a more personal
      or internal reservation.
    grammar_point: とは限らない (not necessarily)
post_false_friends_writeup: The main difference between 「ないことはない」 and similar expressions lies in the
  degree of affirmation or possibility they convey. 「ないことはない」 expresses a modest affirmation, implying
  that something is 'possible' but not necessarily highly probable or a preferred option. Expressions
  like 「というわけではない」 and 「とは限らない」 negate or question something, while 「はずがない」 and 「そうもない」 express impossibility
  or low probability. When choosing the appropriate expression, consider whether you want to acknowledge
  possibility (even a slight one) or express a stronger negation or disbelief. 「ないことはない」 is often used
  to soften a statement, offer a concession, or reluctantly confirm a fact.

    scene: Discussing someone's food preferences with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: This sentence uses the negative form of a な-adjective 「嫌いではない」 with 「ないことはない」 to express a
      reluctant or qualified affirmation about liking something. The phrase 「ほどではない」 further clarifies
      the degree of preference.
    etymology: The word 「納豆」 (nattō) is a traditional Japanese food made from fermented soybeans, a staple
      in many Japanese diets known for its unique smell and sticky texture. 「嫌い」 (kirai) is a な-adjective
      meaning dislike or hate, commonly used for preferences.

    scene: A mentor advising a new employee on a challenging project.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of the polite form 「ありません」 and the indirectness of 「成功できないことはありません」 conveys a respectful
      but firm message from an older mentor to a junior. It implies that while success is possible, it
      demands significant effort and careful planning, as indicated by 「周到な準備が必要です」.
    etymology: 「周到」 (shūtō) means thorough or meticulous, often used in contexts of planning or preparation.
      「準備」 (junbi) means preparation. The combination highlights the careful planning required for success.

      creates a strong contrast, emphasizing her current enjoyment.
    etymology: 「苦手」 (nigate) means poor at or not good at something. It is derived from 「苦しむ手」 (kurushimu
      te), meaning 'hand that suffers', implying difficulty or lack of skill.

          - もし 準備 を し ない と 間に合わ ない なら、急が なく て も いい よ。
        english: If we won't make it in time without preparation, then you don't have to rush.
        hint: This is a direct conditional statement about not making it in time. We're looking for a
          double negative that implies a nuanced 'it's not that we won't make it in time'.
    scene: A team leader giving instructions to a junior member.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: conditional (～ば)
    nuance: The leader uses the plain form 「いいよ」 which is casual. The use of 「間に合わないことはなければ」 presents
      a conditional statement with a subtle emphasis on not falling behind schedule, reflecting careful
      planning. The 「よ」 softens the instruction slightly.
    etymology: 「間に合う」 (maniau) means to be in time for or to be sufficient. It combines 「間」 (ma), interval,
      and 「合う」 (au), to fit/match, literally meaning 'to fit the interval'.
  - english: If it weren't for the fact that I didn't make more effort back then, things would probably
      be going better now.
    japanese:
      - あの 時、もっと 努力 {し ない こと は なかっ たら}、今頃 は もっと 上手く いっ て いる だろう。
      - あの 時、もっと 努力 {し ない こと なかっ たら}、今頃 は もっと 上手く いっ て いる だろう。
    english_literally: If it were not for the fact that I didn't make more effort at that time, now things
      would probably be going better.

          - あの 時、もっと 努力 し ない と いう わけ で は なかっ たら、今頃 は もっと 上手く いっ て いる だろう。
        english: If it wasn't that I didn't make more effort back then, things would probably be going
          better now.
        hint: 「というわけではない (not necessarily)」 clarifies that something is not necessarily true. We're looking
          for an expression that implies a possibility with reservations.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時、もっと 努力 し ない はず が なかっ たら、今頃 は もっと 上手く いっ て いる だろう。
        english: If it wasn't impossible that I didn't make more effort back then, things would probably
          be going better now.
        hint: 「はずがない (logical impossibility)」 indicates strong impossibility. We're looking for an expression
          that admits a degree of possibility, even if it's undesirable.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時、もっと 努力 し そう も なかっ たら、今頃 は もっと 上手く いっ て いる だろう。
        english: If it didn't seem like I didn't make more effort back then, things would probably be
          going better now.
        hint: 「そうもない (very unlikely to)」 expresses that something is very unlikely or doesn't appear to
          be the case. We're looking for an expression that implies a possibility with reservations.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時、もっと 努力 し ない と は 限ら なかっ たら、今頃 は もっと 上手く いっ て いる だろう。
        english: If it wasn't necessarily true that I didn't make more effort back then, things would
          probably be going better now.
        hint: 「とは限らない (not necessarily)」 indicates something is not always true or guaranteed. We're looking
          for an expression that acknowledges a specific possibility, albeit a less-than-ideal one.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時、もっと 努力 し なかっ たら、今頃 は もっと 上手く いっ て いる だろう。
        english: If I hadn't made more effort back then, things would probably be going better now.
        hint: This is a direct past conditional statement. We're looking for a double negative that implies
          a nuanced 'if it weren't for the fact that I didn't make effort'.
    scene: Someone reflecting on past choices and their consequences.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    nuance: This sentence uses the past conditional 「なかったら」 with 「ないことはない」 to express a hypothetical situation
      contrary to past reality. 「もっと 上手く いって いる だろう」 implies a sense of regret or what-if, typical for
      reflective scenarios.
    etymology: 「努力」 (doryoku) means effort or endeavor. It combines 「努」 (do), to exert, and 「力」 (ryoku),
      power/strength.
  - english: If it's not that there's no way to do it, then let's try searching for information a bit
      more.
    japanese:

        english: If it's impossible, then let's try searching for information a bit more.
        hint: This is a direct conditional statement about something not being possible. We're looking
          for a double negative that implies a nuanced 'it's not that it's impossible'.
    scene: Two students are struggling with a difficult homework problem. One is about to give up.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    conjugation: conditional (～ば)
    nuance: The use of `できないことはなければ` gently pushes back against the idea of something being completely
      impossible, encouraging further effort. The plain volitional `探し て みよう` makes it a collaborative
      suggestion.
    etymology: 「情報」 (jōhō) means information, composed of 「情」 (jō), feeling/circumstance, and 「報」 (hō),
      report/news.
  - english: It's not that he's not a genius, but he also works incredibly hard.
    japanese:

          - 彼 は 天才 で は ない が、ものすごく 努力 も し て いる。
        english: He is not a genius, but he also works incredibly hard.
        hint: This is a direct negation, simply stating 'he is not a genius'. We're looking for a double
          negative that implies a nuanced 'it's not that he isn't a genius'.
    scene: Colleagues discussing a successful peer's exceptional abilities.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: Using `天才ではないことはない` acknowledges the person's genius while immediately adding a qualifier
      about their hard work. The `が` or `けど` connects these two contrasting ideas, implying that while
      talent is present, effort is equally significant.
    etymology: 「天才」 (tensai) means genius, combining 「天」 (ten), heaven, and 「才」 (sai), talent/ability.
  - english: It's not that I can't speak English, but it's not like I'm fluent enough to debate.
    japanese:
      - 英語 が {話せ ない こと は ない} が、ディベート できる ほど の 流暢 さ が ある わけ で も ない。
      - 英語 が {話せ ない こと も ない} が、ディベート できる ほど の 流暢 さ が ある わけ で も ない。
      - 英語 が {話せ ない こと は あり ませ ん} が、ディベート できる ほど の 流暢 さ が ある わけ で も あり ませ ん。

    scene: A student talking to a foreign exchange coordinator about their language skills.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: This sentence effectively uses `ないことはない` to acknowledge a basic ability in English, then immediately
      follows with `わけでもない` to temper that statement and clarify the actual level of proficiency. This
      creates a balanced and nuanced self-assessment.
    etymology: 「流暢」 (ryūchō) means fluent or eloquent, combining 「流」 (ryū), flow, and 「暢」 (chō), stretch/extend.
post_example_writeup: The nuance of 「ないことはない」 is often one of a modest affirmation or an expression of
  possibility accompanied by some hesitation. To understand the speaker's true intent, it is crucial to
  pay attention to the context and surrounding words. While it affirms a possibility, it often suggests
  that the situation is not ideal, easy, or the primary desired outcome.
