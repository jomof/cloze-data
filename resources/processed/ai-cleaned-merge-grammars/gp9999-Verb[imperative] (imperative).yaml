details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Giving direct orders, cheerleading, expressing strong desires, or prohibiting actions.
    Often heard in sports, between close friends/family (especially from older to younger), or in military/emergency
    contexts.
  function: To directly command or instruct.
  nuance: Directness, authority, urgency. Can be harsh or intimate depending on context and speaker/listener
    relationship.
  grammatical-role: Forms the predicate of a sentence, acting as a direct command.
etymology: The imperative forms in Japanese have evolved from older grammatical structures. The 「〜え」 ending
  for Godan verbs derives from the *izenkei* (已然形) or realis form, which historically indicated a completed
  action or a state, but in this context, it gained a commanding function. The 「〜ろ」 ending for Ichidan
  verbs and the irregular 「しろ」 and 「こい」 are simplified or irregular developments from earlier forms. The
  negative imperative 「〜な」 comes from the classical negative auxiliary 「ず」 (「ぬ」) combined with 「な」 (a
  particle for prohibition), leading to 「〜ずるな」 or 「〜ぬな」 which eventually simplified to 「〜な」. This 「〜な」
  form is distinct from the sentence-final particle 「な」 that softens requests or expresses exclamation.
writeup: Imperative forms are used to directly command someone to do something. They are highly direct
  and can sound blunt or rude if used improperly, particularly with superiors or strangers. They are commonly
  used among close friends, family members (especially from older to younger), in very informal settings,
  or in situations requiring immediate and unambiguous instruction (e.g., sports, emergencies). There
  are distinct forms for positive commands (Verb-ろ/え, しろ, こい) and negative prohibitions (Verb-dictionary
  + な). The nuance of an imperative can range from a harsh command to an encouraging cheer, depending
  on intonation, context, and the relationship between speakers. For instance, in sports, 「走れ！」 (Hashire!
  - Run!) is an encouraging cheer, while 「やめろ！」 (Yamero! - Stop it!) could be an urgent warning or a stern
  command. Female speakers tend to use these plain imperative forms less frequently than male speakers,
  often opting for softer expressions like 「〜てね」 or 「〜てください」, even in casual settings.
false_friends:
  - term: てなさい
    meaning: Polite imperative (do X)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both are imperatives, 「〜てなさい」 is less direct and carries a sense of instruction or gentle
      urging, often from a superior to a subordinate, whereas the plain imperative 「〜ろ/え」 is very direct
      and can be rude or intimate.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]なさい (polite imperative)'
  - term: ないでください
    meaning: Please don't do X
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ないでください」 is a polite request to refrain from an action, implying a choice, while the negative
      imperative 「〜な」 is a very direct prohibition, allowing no room for negotiation and can be very strong/blunt.
    grammar_point: ないでください・ないで (please don't)
  - term: てほしい
    meaning: I want you to do X
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てほしい」 states a wish or desire, placing the onus of action on the listener's willingness,
      whereas the imperative directly demands the action, carrying the speaker's authority.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]ほしい (to want someone to do)'
  - term: べき
    meaning: Should do X / Should not do X
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜べき」 indicates what is socially or morally proper to do, or a strong recommendation, but
      it's not a direct command. Imperatives are direct orders.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]べき・べきではない (should・should not)'
  - term: てはいけない
    meaning: Must not do X
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てはいけない」 conveys a rule or a strong warning against an action, often implying consequences,
      making it more about general conduct. The negative imperative 「〜な」 is a direct, often immediate,
      prohibition from the speaker.
    grammar_point: 〜てはいけない・〜てはならない (must not)
post_false_friends_writeup: The imperative forms are distinguished by their directness and the speaker's
  assumed authority. While 「〜てなさい」 softens a command, it is still a direct instruction, unlike the plain
  imperative which can be quite abrupt. 「〜ないでください」 and 「〜てはいけない」 are forms of prohibition, but the former
  is a polite request, and the latter emphasizes rules or consequences, both less direct than the stark
  negative imperative 「〜な」. Similarly, 「〜てほしい」 expresses a desire rather than a command, and 「〜べき」 denotes
  obligation or strong recommendation, neither of which directly compels immediate action like the imperative.

  their use often implies a hierarchical relationship or a high degree of intimacy. Students should be
  mindful of these social dynamics to avoid sounding rude or overly demanding.
