etymology: The imperative form (命令形) has deep roots in classical Japanese, evolving from various endings
  that conveyed direct instruction or strong desire. Its structure reflects ancient linguistic patterns
  for expressing immediate and forceful directives. The forms for Godan verbs (Group 1) often derive from
  the 'e' sound in classical Japanese, indicating direct address, while Ichidan verbs (Group 2) and irregular
  verbs have developed their unique patterns, though all serve the fundamental purpose of commanding.
  Over time, while the forms largely remained, their social usage became more restricted to casual or
  hierarchical contexts, or situations of urgency.
writeup: 'The imperative form, or 命令形 (meirei-kei), is a direct way to give commands or strong instructions
  in Japanese. It is typically used in casual speech among close friends or family, by superiors to subordinates,
  or in urgent situations like warnings or shouts. Due to its directness, it can often sound forceful
  or even rude if used inappropriately with someone of higher status or someone you don''t know well.
  For Group 1 verbs (五段動詞, godan doushi), the final ''u'' sound changes to an ''e'' sound (e.g., 行く (iku)
  becomes 行け (ike)). For Group 2 verbs (一段動詞, ichidan doushi), the final ''ru'' changes to ''ro'' (e.g.,
  食べる (taberu) becomes 食べろ (tabero)). Irregular verbs する (suru) and くる (kuru) have their own unique imperative
  forms: しろ (shiro) and こい (koi) respectively. While the imperative form is common in casual male speech,
  both genders use it in specific contexts, such as when giving instructions to children, subordinates,
  or in sports and emergencies. It is less common for women to use the plain imperative in general conversation,
  especially with male speakers, favoring softer alternatives. The nuance of the imperative can shift
  significantly based on the speaker''s tone. A harsh tone makes it a strict command, while a gentler
  or encouraging tone can make it a supportive instruction, especially in contexts like cheering someone
  on. For prohibitions, the plain negative form of the verb is combined with the particle な (e.g., 行くな
  (ikuna) - ''Don''t go''). This negative imperative also carries a strong, direct tone.'

  - term: 〜なさい (polite imperative)
    meaning: Polite imperative
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While also an imperative, 「〜なさい」 is softer and generally used by adults to children or by
      teachers to students, suggesting a gentle instruction rather than a forceful command. We're looking
      for the more direct, casual imperative.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]なさい (polite imperative)'
  - term: 〜てください (please do)
    meaning: Please do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てください」 is a polite request form, emphasizing politeness and asking for cooperation, rather
      than issuing a direct command. We're looking for a direct command.
    grammar_point: てください (polite request)
  - term: 〜てはいけない (must not)
    meaning: Must not do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てはいけない」 expresses a strong prohibition or rule, which is a negative command. The imperative
      form itself is primarily for positive commands, though it can combine with な for negative imperative.
      We're looking for the basic positive imperative.
    grammar_point: 〜てはいけない・〜てはならない (must not)
  - term: 〜べきだ (should do)
    meaning: Should do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜べきだ」 indicates a strong obligation or recommendation, often based on moral or logical reasoning,
      rather than a direct order. We're looking for a command, not a suggestion of what 'should' be done.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]べき・べきではない (should・should not)'
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between the imperative (plain or polite form), or 「〜てください」,
  consider the social hierarchy and your relationship with the listener. The plain imperative is the most
  direct and can sound harsh if not used with care, while the polite imperative softens the command, making
  it more suitable for giving instructions to those younger or of lower status in a gentle manner. 「〜てください」
  is a neutral polite request, emphasizing politeness and cooperation, suitable for broader situations.
examples:
  - english: Go!
    japanese:
      - '{行け}！'
      - '{行け} よ！'
      - '{行け}っ！'

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 行っ て ください！
        english: Please go!
        hint: 「〜てください」 is a polite request. We're looking for a direct, informal command.
    scene: A soccer coach yells at a player during a practice.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The coach uses 「行け」, the plain imperative, to give a sharp, immediate command to his player.
      This is typical in sports or urgent situations where directness and speed are prioritized. It reflects
      the hierarchical relationship between a coach and player, and the expectation of immediate compliance.
      The male speaker's use of this direct form is also very common in male speech, especially when issuing
      commands.
  - english: Eat your vegetables!
    japanese:

      - competing_japanese:
          - 野菜 を 摂取 する の が いい！
        english: It's good to consume vegetables!

    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The father uses 「食べろ」, a direct and common way for parents to instruct children. This form
      is very typical in a family setting, where directness is acceptable and expected. The use of the
      imperative here reflects the parent's authority over the child. While it's a command, in this family
      context, it's not necessarily harsh but rather a firm instruction.
  - english: Sit down!
    japanese:
      - '{座れ}！'
      - '{座れ} よ！'
      - '{座れ}っ！'
    english_literally: Sit!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 座っ てろ！
        english: Keep sitting! / Sit and stay! (Continuous imperative)
        hint: 「座ってろ」 emphasizes a continuous state or an order to stay put, as opposed to the simple command
          to 'sit down' at this moment. We're looking for a direct, one-time action command.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 座っ て ください！
        english: Please sit down!
        hint: 「〜てください」 is a polite request. We're looking for a direct command, often used in urgent situations
          or when frustrated.

    setting: commanding
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Even though female speakers often use softer language, in a situation of frustration or when
      dealing with misbehavior, 「座れ」 is a direct command that a female teacher might use to exert authority.
      It conveys a strong, no-nonsense directive. This example highlights that context can override typical
      gendered speech patterns.
  - english: Come here!
    japanese:
      - '{来い}！'
      - '{来い} よ！'
      - '{来い}っ！'
    english_literally: Come!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 来 て！
        english: Come (te-form casual request)!
        hint: 「来て」 is a casual request using the te-form. We're looking for a more direct and commanding
          imperative, typical in urgent or hierarchical situations.
    scene: A dog owner calls their dog.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: When addressing animals, the plain imperative form like 「来い」 is perfectly natural and common.
      There's no need for politeness, so the directness of the imperative is appropriate. This demonstrates
      a non-human context where the imperative is used without any negative social implications.
  - english: Listen carefully!
    japanese:
      - よく {聞け}！
      - よく {聞け} よ！
    english_literally: Well listen!

    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: In a mentoring relationship, 「聞け」 can be used to emphasize the importance of the instruction.
      While direct, it can convey sincerity and a strong desire for the mentee to truly understand. This
      usage highlights that the imperative is not always negative; it can also show earnestness and care
      when used appropriately within a close relationship.
  - english: Run!

          in emergency situations.
    scene: Someone shouts a warning during an emergency.
    register: casual
    setting: emergency/alarm
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    nuance: In an emergency, direct commands like 「走れ」 are used for clarity and urgency, overriding typical
      politeness conventions. The focus is on immediate action, and the imperative form perfectly conveys
      this without any nuanced social implications beyond the necessity of the moment.
  - english: Wait!
    japanese:
      - '{待て}！'

          used when someone is about to do something you want to stop.
    scene: A police officer shouts at a suspect who is trying to flee.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    nuance: The imperative 「待て」 is used in situations of authority, especially by law enforcement. It
      demands immediate compliance and signals the serious nature of the situation. This usage is common
      in formal professional contexts where direct commands are part of the job function.
  - english: Throw it!
    japanese:
      - '{投げろ}！'

      - competing_japanese:
          - 物 を 離し て！

          a direct command to throw.
    scene: A baseball coach instructs his pitcher during a game.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Similar to the 'Go!' example, 「投げろ」 is a straightforward command used in sports for efficiency
      and clear communication. The coach's male gender and older age reinforce the common association
      of the imperative with male speech and hierarchical roles in Japanese society, though its primary
      function here is purely practical for the game.
  - english: Give it to me!
    japanese:
      - '{くれ}！'
      - '{くれ} よ！'
      - '{くれ}っ！'
    english_literally: Give!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ください！
        english: Please give it to me!
        hint: 「ください」 is a polite request. We're looking for a very direct, informal demand, often used
          when showing impatience or in a very casual context.
    scene: A child demands a toy from another child.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「くれ」 is the imperative form of くれる (kureru) and is a very direct and informal way to ask someone
      to give something to the speaker. It is often associated with male speech and can sound quite brusque,
      especially when used by a child to another child, reflecting their unrefined directness.
  - english: Read this book!
    japanese:
      - この 本 を {読め}！
      - この 本 を {読め} よ！
    english_literally: This book read!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 を 読ん で ください！
        english: Please read this book!
        hint: 「〜てください」 is a polite request. We're looking for a direct, informal command.
    scene: A librarian sternly tells a student to read a particular book.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Here, 「読め」 is a direct command. While a female speaker might typically use softer language,
      in a context of authority like a librarian giving an instruction, the plain imperative can be used
      to convey a firm expectation. It is direct and leaves no room for ambiguity.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the context and relationship is crucial when using the imperative
  form. While it can be a straightforward command, its impact varies greatly from a coach shouting instructions
  to a parent disciplining a child, or even a friend cheering you on. Always consider if the directness
  is appropriate for the situation and your relationship with the listener to avoid sounding impolite
  or demanding.
