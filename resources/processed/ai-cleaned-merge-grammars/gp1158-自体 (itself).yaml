formation:
  Noun + 自体: Emphasizes the noun itself, implying its inherent quality or essence.
  Noun Phrase + 自体: Emphasizes the entire noun phrase, often referring to an action or situation in and
    of itself.
  Noun + それ + 自体: Provides stronger emphasis on the noun itself, often used when distinguishing it from
    other aspects or elements related to it, with 「それ」 acting as a demonstrative pronoun for the preceding
    noun. This construction is more emphatic and formal than simply using 「自体」 after the noun.
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  register: formal
  function: Used to emphasize the inherent qualities or essence of something, often to distinguish it
    from related or external factors.
  nuance: Implies that the focus is on the thing itself, rather than external factors or related elements.
    It highlights the noun's core identity or intrinsic nature. It can convey a sense of 'even if everything
    else is disregarded, this one thing is important' or 'this is fundamentally true about this thing'.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a dependent noun, usually modifying or emphasizing the preceding noun
    or noun phrase.
  logical-flow: Often used to draw a contrast between the intrinsic nature of something and its surrounding
    circumstances or effects. It clarifies that the primary focus is on the entity in question, not on
    what it leads to or is associated with.
  temporal-flow: Not directly related to time, but can emphasize the inherent state of something at a
    given moment, independent of a temporal sequence.
  spatial-flow: Not directly related to space, but can emphasize the inherent characteristics of an object
    or concept, regardless of its location or context.
etymology: '「自体」 (jitai) is composed of two kanji: 「自」 (ji), meaning "self" or "oneself," and 「体」 (tai),
  meaning "body," "substance," or "form." When combined, they literally translate to "self-body" or "self-substance,"
  thereby conveying the meaning of "the thing itself" or "in and of itself." This etymology directly reflects
  its function in emphasizing the intrinsic nature or essence of a noun, setting it apart from external
  attributes or influences.'
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「自体」(jitai) functions as a dependent noun used to place emphasis on the inherent qualities, nature, or essence of the preceding noun or noun phrase. It highlights the noun itself, distinct from any external factors, circumstances, or effects. It can be translated as "itself," "in and of itself," or "the very thing."

  This expression is typically used in formal or semi-formal contexts, including academic writing, business discussions, or formal speeches. While it is grammatically versatile, its primary role is to sharpen the focus on the subject at hand, often to draw a contrast or to isolate an inherent truth.

  ### Usage Notes:
  *   **Emphasis on Nouns**: 「自体」 directly follows a noun to emphasize that specific noun. For example, 「問題自体」(mondai jitai) means "the problem itself."
  *   **Emphasis on Noun Phrases (Actions/Concepts)**: It can also follow noun phrases, especially those ending in 「こと」 or 「の」, to emphasize the action or concept. For instance, 「参加すること自体」(sanka suru koto jitai) means "the act of participating itself."
  *   **「それ自体」 for Stronger Emphasis**: Adding 「それ」 (sore, meaning "that") before 「自体」 creates a more emphatic expression: 「〜それ自体」(sore jitai). This construction further isolates the noun, often implying that its intrinsic nature is being considered apart from all other aspects. For example, 「技術それ自体」(gijutsu sore jitai) would strongly emphasize "the technology itself," perhaps in contrast to its applications or implications.

  「自体」 is crucial for conveying precision and nuanced emphasis in Japanese, allowing speakers to direct attention to the core identity or inherent characteristics of a subject.

  - term: 自身
    meaning: oneself; myself/himself/herself
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「自体」, 「自身」 often refers to a person's own self or being, or emphasizes that the person
      themselves is doing something. For example, 「彼自身が言った」 (kare jishin ga itta) means 'he himself said
      it.' While 「自体」 can refer to the essence of something abstract, 「自身」 is more commonly used for sentient
      beings or their direct involvement. It can also be used reflexively, e.g., 「自分自身」 (jibun jishin)
      meaning 'myself.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:自身 (oneself)
  - term: そのもの
    meaning: the very thing; the thing itself; exactly that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そのもの」 (sono mono) is used to emphasize that something is exactly what it seems or is claimed
      to be, often confirming its authenticity or definitive nature. It focuses on identity. For example,
      「この絵は本物そのものだ」 (kono e wa honmono sono mono da) means 'This painting is the very real thing.' While
      「自体」 focuses on the inherent qualities or essence, 「そのもの」 emphasizes being the perfect or genuine
      example of something.
    grammar_point: そのもの (itself)
  - term: 本質
    meaning: essence; true nature
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「自体」 and 「本質」 relate to the inherent nature of something, 「本質」 refers more specifically
      to the fundamental, underlying characteristic or essence that defines something, which may not be
      immediately obvious. 「自体」 emphasizes the thing as it is, in its entirety, distinct from external
      factors, whereas 「本質」 delves into what makes it that thing at its deepest level. For example, you
      might say 「彼の問題の本質はコミュニケーション不足にある」 (Kare no mondai no honshitsu wa komyunikeeshon busoku ni aru)
      to point to the core issue, but 「問題自体は単純だ」 (Mondai jitai wa tanjun da) to state that the problem
      as a whole is not complex.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:本質 (essence)
  - term: 本来
    meaning: originally; primarily; essentially; by nature
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「自体」 emphasizes the thing itself, isolating it from external factors, 「本来」 refers to
      something's original, inherent, or fundamental state or nature. It often implies 'what it should
      be' or 'how it truly is by nature,' in contrast to how it currently appears or functions. For example,
      「本来の目的」 (honrai no mokuteki) means 'the original/true purpose.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:本来 (originally or inherently)
  - term: 正に
    meaning: exactly; precisely; truly; just; indeed
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「正に」 is an adverb emphasizing exactness or truth, often used to affirm that something is precisely
      as stated or expected. It can highlight a moment or a characteristic. In contrast, 「自体」 is a noun
      that emphasizes the inherent quality or existence of the subject itself, rather than confirming
      a description. For example, 「正にその通りだ」 (masani sono toori da) means 'That is exactly right.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:正に (exactly)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「自体」, 「自身」, 「そのもの」, 「本質」, 「本来」, and 「正に」 all serve to emphasize a noun
  or concept, their specific nuances differ. 「自体」 focuses on the intrinsic nature or core essence of something,
  isolating it from external factors. 「自身」 is typically used when referring to a person or their direct
  involvement, emphasizing the individual themselves. 「そのもの」, on the other hand, highlights the authenticity
  or perfect embodiment of something, confirming it is precisely what it purports to be. 「本質」 delves into
  the fundamental, underlying characteristic or essence of something, often that which is not immediately
  apparent. 「本来」 points to something's original, inherent, or fundamental state, often implying an ideal
  or natural state. Lastly, 「正に」 is an adverb emphasizing exactness or truth, affirming that something
  is precisely as stated. Understanding these subtle distinctions is key to precise and natural Japanese
  expression.

      - この 技術 は、環境 へ の 影響 {自体} は 少ない。
      - この 技術 {自体} が 環境 に 与える 影響 は 少ない。
      - この 技術 {自体}、環境 負荷 は 小さい。
    english_literally: Regarding this technology, its environmental impact itself is small.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 技術 は、環境 へ の 影響 は 少ない。
        english: The environmental impact of this technology is low.

          of the technology's environmental impact, separate from external factors.
    scene: A company is showcasing a new manufacturing process, focusing on its environmental benefits.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The speaker, addressing a group in a formal setting, uses 「環境への影響自体は少ない」 to underscore that
      the environmental impact is inherently low. This focuses on the technology's core design rather
      than other aspects like its usage methods or disposal, showing a precise technical assessment. The
      use of 「は」 after 「自体」 further emphasizes this distinction with other potential concerns.

    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The male speaker maintains a semi-formal tone appropriate for professional discussion. By
      saying 「行動自体は理解できる」, he acknowledges the inherent rationality of the colleague's decisions, separating
      it from the surprising and perhaps negative consequences. This shows a balanced view, attributing
      the problem to the outcome, not the initial action. The 「は」 after 「自体」 emphasizes this distinction.

    japanese:
      - 彼女 が その 場 に いる こと {自体} が、みんな に とっ て 励み に なっ た。

      This highlights the profound, unadulterated impact of her existence in that moment, making it more
      personal and emotionally resonant.

    nuance: The male speaker, in a business context, uses 「アイデアそれ自体」 to strongly emphasize the intrinsic
      innovativeness of the idea, making it clear that its brilliance is not in question. This use of
      「それ」 adds significant force to the emphasis, contrasting it directly with the external challenges
      of implementation. It’s a common strategy in business to praise the concept while discussing practical
      obstacles.

        english: A life where earning money becomes the sole purpose is lonely.
        hint: This says earning money became the purpose. We want to emphasize that the act of earning

    register: formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male

    nuance: The male philosopher speaks formally in an academic setting. The phrase 「稼ぐこと自体が目的」 isolates
      the act of earning money as the sole intrinsic purpose, stripping it of any broader meaning or contribution.
      This highlights the inherent hollowness of such a life, criticizing the act itself as the ultimate
      goal rather than a means to an end.

          exist.
    scene: A city council member is giving an update on urban development and public welfare.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The female council member uses formal language to present a nuanced report. 「治安自体は改善された」 points
      to the inherent improvement in public safety, isolating this aspect from broader urban issues. The
      「は」 after 「自体」 creates a clear contrast, acknowledging positive change in one area while still pointing
      out remaining problems, conveying a comprehensive assessment.

    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The male librarian, speaking in a semi-formal academic context, uses 「書物それ自体が」 to powerfully
      assert that the book's inherent nature—its physical form, content, and age—is the source of its
      historical value. The strong emphasis from 「それ」 highlights that the book is a valuable artifact
      in its own right, independent of its story or ownership history.
  - english: The problem itself isn't difficult, but understanding the instructions is.
    japanese:
      - この 問題 {自体} は 難しく ない よ、で も 指示 を 理解 する の が 大変 な ん だ。
      - この 問題 {自体} は 難しく ない けど、説明 が 分かり にくい ん だ。

        english: This problem isn't difficult, but understanding the instructions is.
        hint: This simply states the problem isn't difficult. We want to emphasize that the problem itself,
          separate from other factors like instructions, isn't hard.
    scene: A mother helping her child with homework.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The mother uses 「問題自体は難しくないよ」 in a supportive tone. The particle 「よ」 softens the statement
      and makes it sound more encouraging. She differentiates the inherent difficulty of the problem from
      the external difficulty of understanding the instructions, showing her empathy and analytical approach.
  - english: The system itself is flawed, so simply patching it won't solve the issue.
    japanese:
      - その システム {それ 自体} に 欠陥 が ある の で、単なる パッチ で は 解決 し ない。
      - システム {それ 自体} が 根本 的 に おかしい から、パッチ を 当てる だけ じゃ 駄目 だ。
    english_literally: Because that system itself has a flaw, with mere patches it will not be solved.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その システム に 欠陥 が ある の で、単なる パッチ で は 解決 し ない。
        english: The system has a flaw, so simply patching it won't solve the issue.
        hint: This states the system has a flaw. We need to strongly emphasize that the fundamental nature
          of the system itself is flawed, implying a deeper problem than just external bugs.
    scene: Software engineers discussing a critical bug in a core system.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The male engineer uses 「システムそれ自体に欠陥がある」 to strongly assert that the flaw lies at the very
      core of the system's design or fundamental components, not just in its superficial aspects. The
      use of 「それ」 underscores the gravity and inherent nature of the problem, indicating that a more profound
      solution is required. This is typical in professional, technical discussions.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「自体」 can follow a noun, or a noun phrase ending in 「こと」,
  to emphasize the inherent nature or core identity of that thing or action. When 「それ」 is added directly
  before 「自体」 (e.g., 「〜それ自体」), the emphasis becomes even stronger, isolating the noun or concept more
  emphatically and often drawing a sharper contrast with external factors.
