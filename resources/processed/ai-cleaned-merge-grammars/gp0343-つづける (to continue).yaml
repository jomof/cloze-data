    "etymology": "The verb 「続ける (つづける)」 is derived from the verb 「続く (つづく)」, which means \"to continue\" or \"to last.\" 「続ける」 is the transitive form, meaning \"to continue something,\" while 「続く」 is intransitive, meaning \"something continues.\"",
    "writeup": "The verb 「{続ける}」 (tsuzukeru) signifies the continuation of an action. It is formed by attaching 「続ける」 to the **-masu stem** of another verb. This structure emphasizes that an action is sustained over a period, or that one persists in an action without interruption.\n\nIt is crucial to understand the nuanced difference when connecting verbs. While the **-masu stem + 続ける** form implies that the preceding action is being done *continuously* or *persistently*, using the **て-form** of a verb followed by a separate verb (e.g., 頑張って 続ける) often implies that the first action is completed, and *then* the second action of continuing takes place. For example, 「走り続ける」 means \"to continue running\" as a single, sustained action, whereas 「走って 続ける」 implies \"run, and then continue (something else, or the act of continuing itself).\" The former is a single, continuous act, while the latter separates the initial action from the act of continuing.\n\n{続ける} is a transitive verb, meaning it takes a direct object when used independently (e.g., 「仕事を 続ける」 - to continue the work). However, when affixed to the -masu stem of another verb, it serves to modify the action of that verb, emphasizing its ongoing nature. This grammatical structure is common across various registers and is fundamental for expressing sustained actions in Japanese.",

While the primary formation involves attaching it to the -masu stem of a verb, be aware of the difference in nuance if you were to use it with the te-form of a verb. For instance, 「V-masu続ける」 (e.g., 頑張り続ける) means \"to continue V-ing\" as a single, sustained action, whereas 「V-te続ける」 (e.g., 頑張って続ける) implies \"do V and then continue,\" with 「続ける」 acting on the preceding clause. Also, be aware that direct imperative forms like 「続けなさい」 can sound strong and should be used carefully depending on the context and relationship.",
