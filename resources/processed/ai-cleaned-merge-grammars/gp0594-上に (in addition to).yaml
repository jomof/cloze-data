jlpt: N2
etymology: The etymology of 「上に」 can be understood by breaking it down. 「上」 (ue) means "above" or "on
  top," and 「に」 (ni) is a particle indicating location or direction. Therefore, 「上に」 literally means "on
  top of" something. This conveys the sense of adding something more to what is already there, similar
  to adding another layer on top of an existing one, reinforcing the idea of accumulation or addition.
writeup: '「上に」 (ue ni) is a grammar pattern used to express that something is "in addition to" or "besides"
  something else. It functions as a slightly formal way of connecting two pieces of information, presenting
  the second as an additional quality or action that compounds the first. Think of it as saying "on top
  of (A), (B) also applies." This pattern is versatile and can follow various parts of speech: Verbs (plain
  form) + 「上に」: For example, 「食べる上に」 (in addition to eating). い-Adjectives (plain form) + 「上に」: For example,
  「美味しい上に」 (in addition to being delicious). な-Adjectives + 「な」 + 「上に」: For example, 「静かな上に」 (in addition
  to being quiet). Nouns + 「の」 + 「上に」: For example, 「医者の上に」 (in addition to being a doctor). Nouns + 「である」
  + 「上に」: This is a more formal or objective way to connect nouns, for example, 「学生である上に」 (in addition
  to being a student). The particle 「に」 can sometimes be omitted from this structure (e.g., 「上」), particularly
  in very casual speech or certain fixed expressions, but including it is more common and generally recommended
  for clarity. Important Considerations: 「上に」 is crucially used to highlight qualities or actions that
  are equivalent or similar in nature. This means you typically connect two positive attributes (e.g.,
  "good and also convenient") or two negative attributes (e.g., "expensive and also small"). Using 「上に」
  to connect contradictory attributes (e.g., "handsome and also rude") might sound unnatural or sarcastic.
  While not always strictly prohibited, it''s generally best to maintain a consistent tone or logical
  relationship between the two clauses when using this pattern.'

  - term: 上は
    meaning: Once, Since, Now that, As long as
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「上に」 which adds an additional quality or action, 「上は」 introduces a condition or reason
      based on a preceding fact, often implying an obligation or logical consequence. For example, 「約束した上は守るべきだ」
      (Since you promised, you should keep it).
    grammar_point: '[Clause]以上(は)・上は (since・now that)'
  - term: 上で
    meaning: After, Upon
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「上で」 indicates a sequence of actions or events, meaning 'after' or 'upon doing something',
      implying a prerequisite. 「調べた上で決める」 (Decide after investigating). In contrast, 「上に」 adds qualities
      or information to a single subject.
    grammar_point: 上で (after doing)
  - term: その上
    meaning: Besides, In addition, Furthermore
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「その上」 is a general discourse marker that introduces additional information, often to reinforce
      or add to a previous statement. While similar to 「上に」, 「その上」 is less tied to the specific attributes
      of a single subject and often feels more like 'what's more' at a sentence level.
    grammar_point: それに (in addition・moreover)
  - term: おまけに
    meaning: In addition, On top of that, What is more, To make matters worse
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「おまけに」 often carries a nuance of an unexpected or even aggravating addition, especially when
      the preceding statement is negative. It can suggest 'to make matters worse' or 'as if that weren't
      enough'. 「上に」 is more neutral in its implication of compounding.
    grammar_point: おまけに (in addition・on top of that)
  - term: しかも
    meaning: Moreover, furthermore
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「しかも」 connects two facts, often indicating that the second fact is surprising or adds to the
      gravity (positive or negative) of the first. While similar to 「上に」 in adding information, 「しかも」
      tends to introduce a stronger, often more unexpected, additional point. It acts more as a conjunctive
      adverb rather than attaching directly to a clause like 「上に」.
    grammar_point: それに (in addition・moreover)
  - term: また
    meaning: Also, As well, Moreover, Again, Additionally
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「また」 is a very general term for adding information, meaning 'also' or 'again'. It's simpler
      and doesn't carry the same emphasis on compounding or layering as 「上に」. 「上に」 is more specific in
      presenting an additional quality directly tied to the subject.
    grammar_point: また (again; also; or)
  - term: 更に
    meaning: Even more or further, Again, More and more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「更に」 emphasizes an increase in degree, quantity, or an additional step ('furthermore,' 'moreover').
      While it adds information, it focuses on intensifying or extending, whereas 「上に」 focuses on adding
      a distinct, often parallel, quality.
    grammar_point: 更に (even more)
  - term: し〜し
    meaning: And, Giving reasons
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「し〜し」 is used to list multiple reasons or parallel facts, often informally. It implies that
      there are other reasons not explicitly stated. 「上に」, while also listing, often emphasizes the *cumulative*
      effect of the qualities on a single subject, and is slightly more formal than 「し〜し」.
    grammar_point: し〜し (and; listing reasons)
  - term: ばかりでなく
    meaning: Not only...but also, As well as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ばかりでなく」 also expresses "not only A, but also B," it has a more direct and often exhaustive
      listing feel. 「上に」 carries a nuance of one thing being 'on top of' another, implying a cumulative
      effect on the same subject, and can sometimes feel more natural when describing two positive or
      two negative qualities that build on each other.
    grammar_point: 〜だけでなく・〜ばかりでなく・〜ばかりか (not only... but also)
  - term: ばかりか
    meaning: Not only... but also; much more than; in addition to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ばかりか」 is a more emphatic way to say 'not only A, but also B', often implying that B is even
      more significant or surprising than A. While 「上に」 focuses on two qualities stacking on a single
      subject, 「ばかりか」 can introduce a consequence or a further development that goes beyond the initial
      statement.
    grammar_point: 〜だけでなく・〜ばかりでなく・〜ばかりか (not only... but also)
  - term: 加えて
    meaning: In addition to; not only... but also; moreover; what's more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「加えて」 is a conjunctive adverb primarily used to add a new, often related, point or reason.
      It acts more like a sentence connector. 「上に」 typically connects two qualities or actions *of the
      same subject*, emphasizing the layering or compounding of these attributes. 「加えて」 is generally more
      formal.
    grammar_point: それに (in addition・moreover)
  - term: のみならず
    meaning: Not only...but also, Not just...but also, What is more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「のみならず」 is a more formal and emphatic version of "not only... but also" than 「上に」 or 「ばかりでなく」.
      It often implies a broader scope or a surprising extent of addition. While similar in function,
      「上に」 tends to describe attributes that pile up on a single item, whereas 「のみならず」 can introduce a
      completely new, parallel item.
    grammar_point: はもとより・のみならず (not only・let alone)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「上に」 is best used when connecting qualities or actions that are similar in
  nature, especially when emphasizing a compounding effect where one attribute is 'on top of' another.
  While expressions like 「その上」, 「おまけに」, 「しかも」, 「また」, and 「更に」 can also add information, they often carry
  different nuances regarding emphasis, emotional tone, or scope. For instance, 「おまけに」 can imply 'to make
  matters worse', while 「その上」 is a more general 'what's more'. 「ばかりでなく」 and 「ばかりか」 are also used for 'not
  only... but also,' but 「上に」 often feels more natural for properties directly stacking on a single item,
  whereas 「のみならず」 can introduce a completely new, parallel item. Expressions like 「上は」 and 「上で」 are distinct
  in their grammatical function, indicating conditions or sequences of action, and should not be confused
  with the additive function of 「上に」.

  - english: This smartphone has many features, and its design is stylish too.
    japanese:
      - この スマホ は 機能 が 多い {上 に}、デザイン も おしゃれ だ。
      - この スマホ は 機能 が 多い {上 に}、デザイン も おしゃれ だ ね。

          - この スマホ は 機能 が 多い {し}、デザイン も おしゃれ だ。
        english: This smartphone has many features, and its design is also stylish.
        hint: The 「し〜し」 structure lists reasons or facts, often with a more casual tone. We are looking
          for a pattern that emphasizes the compounding of attributes.
    scene: A young professional is showing a new smartphone to a colleague, highlighting its positive
      aspects.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker uses 「多い」, an い-adjective, to describe the phone's features, and 「おしゃれだ」, a な-adjective,
      for its design. Both are positive attributes, reinforcing the rule that 「上に」 connects similar qualities.
      The phrasing implies a comprehensive benefit from both aspects.
    etymology: The term おしゃれ (oshare) originally referred to dressing up, evolving to mean 'fashionable'
      or 'stylish' in a broader sense, reflecting a positive aesthetic quality which compounds well with
      the functionality mentioned.
  - english: The ramen at that shop is small in portion, and expensive too.
    japanese:

          - あの 店 の ラーメン は 量 が 少ない。{おまけ に}、値段 も 高い。
        english: The ramen at that shop is small in portion. To make matters worse, it's expensive too.
        hint: 「おまけに」 often suggests an unexpected or aggravating addition, carrying a more negative tone
          than simply adding information. We are looking for a neutral way to compound these attributes.
    scene: Two friends are complaining about a recent dining experience at a ramen shop.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Here, 「少ない」 and 「高い」 are both negative い-adjectives, perfectly illustrating how 「上に」 is used
      to stack similar negative qualities. The tone is one of shared disappointment.
    etymology: ラーメン (ramen) is a loanword from Chinese, reflecting a cultural exchange that brought this
      popular noodle dish to Japan. The qualities of 'small portion' and 'expensive' stack up as negative
      attributes of this food item.
  - english: The scenery on this trip was beautiful, and the food was luxurious too.
    japanese:
      - 今回 の 旅行 は 景色 が 美しい {上 に}、食事 も 豪華 だっ た。

        english: The scenery on this trip was beautiful. And the food was luxurious too.
        hint: 「そして」 is a simple conjunction that links two independent clauses. We are looking for a structure
          that emphasizes the compounding of positive attributes for a single subject.
    scene: A traveler recounts the wonderful experiences of their recent vacation to a family member.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「美しい」 is an い-adjective, and 「豪華だった」 is a な-adjective (past tense), both describing positive
      aspects of the trip. The sentence highlights the dual delights of the scenery and the food, adding
      to the overall positive impression of the trip.
    etymology: 豪華 (gōka) combines 豪 (gō, magnificent) and 華 (ka, splendor), indicating a high degree of
      extravagance or luxury. Its use here describes an experience that exceeds expectations, adding to
      the trip's overall positive impression.
  - english: His presentation's content was clear, and his way of speaking was polite too.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の プレゼン は 内容 が 明確 な {上 に}、話し 方 も 丁寧 だっ た。

        english: Not only was his presentation's content clear, but his way of speaking was polite too.
        hint: 「ばかりか」 means 'not only... but also'. While similar, 「上に」 focuses more on the idea of one
          attribute being 'on top of' another, compounding them.
    scene: After a business meeting, two colleagues are debriefing and evaluating a recent presentation.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Both 「明確な」 and 「丁寧だった」 are な-adjectives, connected by 「な」 before 「上に」. This shows the combination
      of two positive attributes in the presentation, indicating high quality in both substance and delivery.
    etymology: プレゼン (purezen) is a clipped form of プレゼンテーション (purezentēshon), a loanword for 'presentation.'
      This common shortening in Japanese business contexts reflects efficiency, much like the clear content
      and polite speaking style being described.
  - english: She is a doctor, and enthusiastic about local volunteer activities too.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 医者 の {上 に}、地域 の ボランティア 活動 に も 熱心 だ。

        english: She is a doctor, and furthermore, enthusiastic about local volunteer activities too.
        hint: 「さらに」 adds information, but it doesn't carry the same nuance of 'stacking' or compounding
          qualities as 「上に」 does, especially when describing multiple roles or attributes of a person.
    scene: At a community event, someone is introducing a notable person to a new attendee, highlighting
      her various commendable roles.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「医者」 is a noun, connected by 「の」 to 「上に」. 「熱心だ」 is a な-adjective. This sentence presents her
      professional status and her dedication to volunteering as two impressive, accumulating qualities,
      showcasing her admirable character.
    etymology: ボランティア (borantia) is a loanword from 'volunteer'. Its inclusion here, alongside being a
      doctor, highlights multiple admirable facets of the person, demonstrating how the grammar point
      stacks diverse positive roles.
  - english: This apartment is inconveniently located, and the rent is high too.
    japanese:

        english: This apartment is inconveniently located. Moreover, the rent is high too.
        hint: 「しかも」 often implies that the second piece of information is unexpected or adds to the negative
          situation in a surprising way. We are looking for a pattern that emphasizes the compounding
          of multiple drawbacks.
    scene: A young adult is discussing their housing search frustrations with a friend, detailing the
      drawbacks of a particular apartment.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「不便な」 is a な-adjective, and 「高い」 is an い-adjective. Both describe negative attributes of the
      apartment. This use of 「上に」 effectively expresses the double disadvantage, reinforcing the speaker's
      frustration.
    etymology: アパート (apāto) is a loanword from 'apartment'. The phrase 「交通の便が不便な」 (kōtsū no ben ga fuben
      na) means 'inconvenient for transportation,' which along with high rent, forms a compounded negative
      evaluation of the living situation.

        english: He is a famous scholar, and also an excellent educator.
        hint: 「また」 is a general 'also' or 'additionally'. While correct, it doesn't convey the sense of
          one quality being 'on top of' another, which 「上に」 emphasizes for cumulative attributes.
    scene: At a university reception, a professor is praising a distinguished guest to a student, highlighting
      their multifaceted contributions.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「学者」 is a noun, and is formally connected with 「である」 before 「上に」. This emphasizes both his
      established academic standing and his additional excellence as an educator. This phrasing is common
      in academic or formal contexts when describing a person's combined merits.
    etymology: 学者 (gakusha) combines 学 (gaku, study) and 者 (sha, person), literally 'person of study.'
      The use of 「である」 is a formal way to state a fact, layering his identity as a scholar with his excellence
      as an educator.
  - english: This incident is complex, and involves many people.
    japanese:

        english: This incident is complex. In addition, it involves many people.
        hint: 「加えて」 is a formal way to say 'in addition'. While functionally similar, 「上に」 specifically
          highlights that the second aspect is 'on top of' the first, making the situation even more so.
    scene: A detective briefing their team on a new, challenging case, emphasizing its difficulties.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「複雑である」 uses the formal 「である」 form before 「上に」, indicating a factual and objective description
      of the incident's difficulty. The second clause, 「多くの人々を巻き込んでいる」, adds another layer of complication.
      Both aspects contribute to the incident being difficult, highlighting the compounding negative factors.
    etymology: 事件 (jiken) combines 事 (ji, matter) and 件 (ken, matter, case), literally 'a matter case.'
      The phrase 「巻き込んでいる」 (makikonde iru) implies involvement or entanglement, compounding the complexity
      of the incident being discussed.

        english: This company offers good benefits, and its working environment is also excellent.
        hint: 「し〜し」 can list multiple points, but 「上に」 specifically emphasizes that one attribute is layered
          on top of another, making the overall situation even better.
    scene: During a job interview or a career fair, a recruiter is highlighting the advantages of working
      at their company.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「充実している」 is a verb in plain form, indicating 'being substantial' or 'being well-provided'.
      「素晴らしい」 is an い-adjective. Both are positive attributes, demonstrating the combined strength of
      the company's offerings. The use of 「上に」 reinforces the idea that these are cumulative benefits.
    etymology: 福利厚生 (fukuri kōsei) refers to welfare benefits, encompassing aspects like health insurance,
      pensions, and other employee perks. 「充実している」 (jūjitsu shite iru) means to be 'substantial' or 'complete',
      emphasizing the comprehensiveness of the benefits. The term 職場環境 (shokuba kankyō) means 'workplace
      environment', highlighting another positive aspect of the company.

          - 彼女 の 歌 は 技術 的 に 完璧 で、{そして} 表現 力 も 豊か だ。
        english: Her singing is technically flawless, and her expression is also rich.
        hint: 「そして」 simply connects two statements. 「上に」 specifically implies that the second quality
          adds to or compounds the first, making the overall assessment even more positive.
    scene: Two music critics are discussing a recent performance by a singer, evaluating her skills.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: Both 「完璧な」 and 「豊かだ」 are な-adjectives, both indicating positive attributes. 「完璧な」 describes
      technical precision, while 「豊かだ」 describes emotional depth. The use of 「上に」 emphasizes that these
      two distinct strengths combine to make her singing truly exceptional, highlighting the layered excellence.
    etymology: 技術的 (gijutsu-teki) means 'technical' and 完璧 (kanpeki) means 'perfect' or 'flawless'. 表現力
      (hyōgenryoku) literally means 'expressive power'. 豊か (yutaka) means 'rich' or 'abundant'. This combination
      of technical skill and rich expression showcases a multifaceted talent, which is perfectly conveyed
      by the compounding nature of 「上に」.
post_example_writeup: Remember that 「上に」 is best used when connecting qualities or actions that are similar
  in nature. Be mindful of the specific nuances of similar expressions to ensure your communication is
  accurate and natural. Connecting completely unrelated or contradictory things might sound unnatural
  or be perceived as ironic.
