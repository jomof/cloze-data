        "usage-context": "Stiff/Formal",
        "function": "To indicate that a subsequent action or decision is made after a preceding action, consideration, or process has been completed. It implies a deliberate, often important, prerequisite step.",
        "nuance": "Implies a logical progression or a necessary prerequisite. The first action is often a foundational step for the second, suggesting a thoughtful or deliberate process. It carries a more formal and official tone than simple temporal connectors."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「上で」 is derived from 「上」 (ue), meaning \"above\" or \"on,\" and 「で」 (de), which can indicate means or condition. Literally, it can be understood as \"with the above/previous,\" implying that something is done based on a prior action or consideration. The use of 「で」 as a case-marking particle highlights the conditional nature of the construction.",
    "writeup": "「上で」 is an expression used to indicate that an action or decision (B) is made *after* a prior action or consideration (A) has been completed. It's akin to saying \"upon (A)\" or \"after (A), (B).\" This grammar point suggests a **logical progression** where A serves as a necessary prerequisite or a foundational step for B. It carries a formal and somewhat official tone, making it more common in written Japanese, official statements, or polite conversation rather than casual speech.\n\n**Formation:**\n*   When used with verbs, 「上で」 attaches to the plain past form (e.g., 読んだ上で).\n*   When used with nouns, it attaches as 「名詞の上で」 (e.g., 調査の上で).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Prerequisite Nature**: The action or consideration before 「上で」 is typically a deliberate, crucial step that forms the basis for the subsequent action. It's not just a simple sequence of events, but rather a dependency.\n*   **Formality**: This expression leans towards formal or semi-formal contexts. While it can be understood in casual settings, other simpler expressions like 「てから」 or 「あとで」 are more common for mere chronological sequence.\n*   **No Passive Verbs**: A key restriction of 「上で」 is that the verb preceding it cannot be in the passive voice. This is because 「上で」 implies a deliberate, controlled action or consideration (A) that leads to (B). Passive verbs often denote a lack of agency or control over the action, which conflicts with the intentionality conveyed by 「上で」. For instance, you cannot say 「医者に教えられた上で」 (upon being told by a doctor) because being told is a passive reception, not a proactive action you perform as a prerequisite.",
