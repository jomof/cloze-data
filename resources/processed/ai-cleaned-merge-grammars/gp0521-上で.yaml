    "etymology": "The grammar point 「上で」 is derived from 「上」 (ue), meaning \"above\" or \"on,\" and 「で」 (de), which can indicate means or condition. Literally, it can be understood as \"with the above/previous,\" implying that something is done based on a prior action or consideration. The use of 「で」 as a case-marking particle highlights the conditional nature of the construction.",
    "writeup": "「上で」 is used to indicate that something happens after or upon completing a previous action or considering a specific condition. It's similar to saying \"after (A)\" or \"upon (A),\" and implies a logical progression or a requirement. 「上で」 is often found in formal settings. The 「上」 means 'above', and 「で」 means 'with'. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The action described by the verb or noun preceding 「上で」 is typically a prerequisite or a logical step before the subsequent action. \n*   The verb preceding 「上で」 cannot be in the passive voice. Passivity implies a lack of control, which doesn't align with the sense of intentionality that 「上で」 conveys.",
