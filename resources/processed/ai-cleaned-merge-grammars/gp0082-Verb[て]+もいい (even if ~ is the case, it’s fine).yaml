    "etymology": "The grammar point 「～てもいい」 is constructed from the te-form of a verb 「～て」, the particle 「も」 (meaning \"even\"), and 「いい」 (meaning \"good\" or \"okay\"). Literally, it translates to \"even if [verb in te-form], it is good.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[て]+もいい」 attaches to the te-form of a verb, expressing permission for an action or indicating that an action is acceptable even under certain conditions. It conveys a nuance similar to \"it's fine to do X\" or \"it's okay if X happens.\" When used in a question, such as 「～してもいいですか」, it serves to ask for permission, contrasting directly with 「～してはいけない」, which expresses prohibition or unacceptability.",

            "conjugation": "plain present affirmative",
            "nuance": "The casual 「来てもいいよ」 with the final particle 「よ」 creates an inviting, slightly suggestive tone. The lack of formal politeness indicates a relaxed, personal relationship."

            "nuance": "The polite conditional 「もしよければ」 (\"if it's alright\") combined with the polite question 「話してもいいですか」 shows respect and consideration, ideal for a first meeting. This demonstrates politeness while also indicating a desire for deeper connection."
