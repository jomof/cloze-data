    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「～てもいい」 is constructed from the te-form of a verb 「～て」, the particle 「も」 (meaning \"even\"), and 「いい」 (meaning \"good\" or \"okay\"). Literally, it translates to \"even if [verb in te-form], it is good.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[て]+もいい」 attaches to the te-form of a verb, expressing permission for an action or indicating that an action is acceptable even under certain conditions. It conveys a nuance similar to \"it's fine to do X\" or \"it's okay if X happens.\" When used in a question, such as 「～してもいいですか」, it serves to ask for permission. This construction can also imply concession, meaning \"even if an action is performed, it is acceptable.\" While 「～てもいい」 can generally be applied to i-adjectives (e.g., 「高くてもいい」) and nouns/na-adjectives (e.g., 「静かでもいい」), this grammar point specifically focuses on its application to verbs.\n\nWhen asking for permission, 「～してもいいですか」 directly contrasts with 「～してはいけない」, which expresses prohibition or unacceptability. Furthermore, the particle 「も」 in 「～てもいい」 can be omitted in casual speech (e.g., 「～ていい」). This makes the expression more direct and is typically used when speaking to close friends or family.",
