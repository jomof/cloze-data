    "etymology": "The grammar point 「～てもいい」 is constructed from the te-form of a verb 「～て」, the particle 「も」 (meaning \"even\"), and 「いい」 (meaning \"good\" or \"okay\"). Literally, it translates to \"even if [verb in te-form], it is good.\"",
    "writeup": "「～てもいい」 expresses permission or that something is acceptable even if a certain condition is true. It is commonly used to ask for permission, express that something is okay, or to concede a point. Remember that「～てもいい」 is different from 「～てはいけない」, which means \"must not\" or \"is not allowed.\"",
