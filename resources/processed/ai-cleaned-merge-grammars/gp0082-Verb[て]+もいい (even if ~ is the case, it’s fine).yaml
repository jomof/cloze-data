    "etymology": "The grammar point 「～てもいい」 is constructed from the te-form of a verb 「～て」, the particle 「も」 (meaning \"even\"), and 「いい」 (meaning \"good\" or \"okay\"). Literally, it translates to \"even if [verb in te-form], it is good.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[て]+もいい」 attaches to the te-form of a verb, expressing permission for an action or indicating that an action is acceptable even under certain conditions. It conveys a nuance similar to \"it's fine to do X\" or \"it's okay if X happens.\" When used in a question, such as 「～してもいいですか」, it serves to ask for permission, contrasting directly with 「～してはいけない」, which expresses prohibition or unacceptability.",

The scene of a student asking a teacher implies a need for explicit permission, which 『読んでもいいですか』 conveys more directly than a simple ability question 『読めますか』."

                    "mitigation": "While 『読んでいいですか』 is also correct for asking permission, adding 『も』 (as in 『読んでもいいですか』) often subtly adds a nuance of 'even if there's a reason not to, is it okay?' or a softer, more deferential request for permission, which is suitable when speaking to a teacher in a formal setting."
