    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from を (particle), 余儀 (another method), なく (conjunctive form of the い-adjective ない), and させる (causative form of する). It literally means \"to not give another way than to (A)\". 余儀なく is often considered a single word meaning 'unavoidably' or 'inevitably'.",
    "writeup": "This formal grammar pattern, similar to 「を余儀なくされる」, generally translates to \"to be forced to (A)\" or \"to compel (something to happen)\".  It comprises the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「余儀」 (another method), the conjunctive form 「なく」 of the *i*-adjective 「ない」, and the causative form 「させる」 of 「する」. It conveys the sense of “not giving another way than to (A).”\n\nTypically, 「を余儀なくさせる」 follows a noun phrase (A), where (A) is the unavoidable action or situation. Unlike 「を余儀なくされる」, the subject of sentences using 「を余儀なくさせる」 is often a non-human cause or entity.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「余儀なく」, though composed of separate words, is often perceived as a single unit meaning \"unavoidably\" or \"inevitably.\"",
