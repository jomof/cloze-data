id: gp0374
meaning: this (near speaker)
pronunciation:
  katakana: コノ
  romaji: kono
formation:
  この + Noun: Used to describe a noun that is physically or conceptually close to the speaker.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The demonstrative `この` combines the proximal root `こ` (indicating proximity to the speaker)
  with the particle `の`. This `の` acts as a genitive particle, similar to 'of' or 's' in English, but
  here it functions to connect the demonstrative root directly to the noun it modifies, forming a pre-nominal
  modifier. This is distinct from demonstrative pronouns like `これ` which can stand alone.
writeup: '`この` is a demonstrative determiner, meaning "this" or "these." It is used to refer to a noun
  that is close to the speaker, both physically and in terms of mental or emotional proximity. Unlike
  `これ`, which is a demonstrative pronoun and can stand alone (e.g., これはペンです - This is a pen), `この` must
  always be followed by a noun (e.g., このペンは私のです - This pen is mine). It functions similarly to an adjective,
  directly modifying the noun.'

  - term: これ (this)
    meaning: this (pronoun)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`これ` is a pronoun and stands alone, referring to "this thing." `この` is a determiner and must

  - term: その (that)
    meaning: that (near listener)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`この` refers to something near the speaker. `その` refers to something near the listener, or
      something previously mentioned.'
    grammar_point: その (that)
  - term: あの (that over there)
    meaning: that (far from both)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`この` refers to something near the speaker. `あの` refers to something far from both the speaker
      and the listener, or something mutually known.'
    grammar_point: あの (interjection)
  - term: どの (which)
    meaning: which (determiner)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`この` is a demonstrative. `どの` is an interrogative, used to ask "which [noun]?" among a group.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どの (which of 3 or more)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the difference between `この`, `その`, `あの`, and `どの` is crucial
  for correctly identifying location and reference. `この`, `その`, and `あの` form a set of demonstrative determiners
  (often called 'ko-so-a-do' words) indicating proximity, while `どの` is their interrogative counterpart.
