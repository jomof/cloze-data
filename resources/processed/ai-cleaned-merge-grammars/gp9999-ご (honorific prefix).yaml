details:
  part-of-speech: prefix
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to show respect to the listener or to an object/action associated with them. Frequently
    seen in polite requests, business communication, and formal settings.
  function: Elevates the noun, verb, or adjective it precedes, expressing politeness, respect, or sometimes
    indicating 'your' or 'honorable' in relation to the listener or a third party.
  nuance: Implies an elevated status for the item or action. While it primarily attaches to Sino-Japanese
    words, some native Japanese words also take 'ご' (e.g., ご飯), which are generally fixed expressions.
  colocation: Often collocates with verbs in humble (謙譲語) or respectful (尊敬語) forms, such as ご連絡ください (please
    contact us) or ご覧になる (to see - respectful).
etymology: The honorific prefix 「ご」 (go) originates from the Chinese character 御, which signifies honor,
  control, or something imperial. When adopted into Japanese, this kanji and its reading 'go' were used
  to form honorifics, primarily attaching to words of Chinese origin (Sino-Japanese words). Its purpose
  is to elevate the status of the person, object, or action being referred to, reflecting a deeply ingrained
  cultural emphasis on respect and social hierarchy. This stands in contrast to 「お」 (o), which generally
  applies to native Japanese words (和語), though both prefixes serve the fundamental function of expressing
  respect.
writeup: |-
  The prefix 「ご」 is an essential component of Japanese polite language, serving to express respect or politeness towards the listener or someone else, or to elevate the status of a noun, adjective, or verb. It is predominantly used with words that have Sino-Japanese (Chinese) origins, which constitute a significant portion of the Japanese lexicon. For instance, words like 連絡 (れんらく - contact), 協力 (きょうりょく - cooperation), or 案内 (あんない - guidance) are often preceded by 「ご」 when used in polite or respectful contexts, becoming ご連絡, ご協力, or ご案内.

  When 「ご」 precedes a noun, it often implies 'your' or 'honorable' in a respectful sense. For example, ご意見 (ごいけん) means 'your opinion,' and ご家族 (ごかぞく) means 'your family.' This elevates the person or item associated with the listener, showing deference.

  With verbs, 「ご」 is typically attached to the stem of Sino-Japanese verbs, particularly when forming polite requests or humble expressions. For instance, 説明する (せつめいする - to explain) can become ご説明ください (please explain) as a polite request, or ご説明いたします (I will explain) as a humble expression indicating the action is done for the listener's benefit.

  It is crucial to distinguish 「ご」 from its counterpart 「お」, which is generally used with native Japanese words. However, there are exceptions where 「ご」 is used with native Japanese words, most notably in fixed expressions like ご飯 (ごはん - meal) or ご馳走 (ごちそう - feast). In these cases, 「ご」 is an integral part of the word and doesn't function as a separable honorific prefix in the same way, though its historical origin is honorific. Understanding the distinction and appropriate usage of 「ご」 is vital for navigating polite social interactions in Japanese.
false_friends:
  - term: お (honorific prefix)
    meaning: Honorific prefix (general use)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「お」 is typically used with native Japanese words (和語) and a small subset of Sino-Japanese
      words, while 「ご」 is primarily used with Sino-Japanese words (漢語). Both serve to add politeness or
      respect. You use them based on the origin of the noun or verb they modify.
    grammar_point: お (honorific prefix)
  - term: 御 (おん)
    meaning: Honorable, imperial (older, formal prefix)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「御 (おん)」 is an older, more formal honorific prefix, often seen in historical contexts or specific
      fixed expressions (e.g., 御所 Gosho - Imperial Palace, 御飯 Gohan - meal, though ご飯 uses the 'go' reading
      here). It shares the same kanji as 「ご」 but has a distinct reading and generally conveys a higher
      level of reverence, often associated with imperial or divine matters.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:御 (on・older formal prefix)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「お」 and 「ご」 both serve as honorific prefixes, their usage largely depends
  on the origin of the word they modify. 「お」 is primarily for native Japanese words, and 「ご」 is for Sino-Japanese
  words. However, remember there are exceptions, and some words have become fixed expressions, so direct
  translation logic doesn't always apply. The older form 「おん」 uses the same kanji as 「ご」 (御) but is a
  distinct, more historical or highly reverent prefix, not to be confused with the common 「ご」.

          - 返事 を お 待ち し て おり ます。
        english: I am waiting for the reply.
        hint: The nuance of 'your' or 'honorable' is lost without the honorific prefix. We're looking
          to show respect for the listener's reply.
    scene: A customer service representative speaking to a client about their inquiry.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「ご返事」 uses the honorific prefix 「ご」 with a Sino-Japanese word, making 'reply' respectful towards
      the customer. This shows that the action (replying) originates from or pertains to the respected
      listener.
  - english: Please contact us.
    japanese:
      - '{ご} 連絡 ください。'

      - competing_japanese:
          - 連絡 ください。
        english: Please contact.
        hint: While understandable, omitting 「ご」 makes the request less polite and formal. We're looking
          for a polite request to contact.
    scene: A notice displayed at a reception desk or in a public service area.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「ご連絡ください」 politely refers to the act of contacting, treating it as an action originating from
      the listener, thus showing respect. The 「ご」 prefix makes the request more courteous than a plain
      verb form.

    japanese:
      - '{ご} 意見 は いかが です か。'
      - '{ご} 意見 を お 聞か せ いただけ ます か。'

    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「ご意見」 politely refers to the listener's opinion, using 「ご」 to elevate their input and show

          - 親切 に ありがとう ござい ます。
        english: Thank you for kindness.
        hint: Omitting 「ご」 here makes the expression less appreciative and polite, especially when expressing
          gratitude for a personal attribute or action. We're looking to express gratitude for someone's
          kindness.
    scene: Expressing gratitude to a stranger who helped you carry heavy bags.

          - 食事 を 召し上がっ て ください。
        english: Please eat your meal.
        hint: While correct, 「食事」 is a more general term. 「ご飯」 with 「ご」 is a very common polite expression

    scene: A waiter serving food to a customer at a high-end restaurant.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: While 「ご飯」 is a common word, its origin includes 「御」, making it an example of a fixed expression

          - 心配 し ない で ください。
        english: Please don't worry.

        english: I will explain.
        hint: This is a basic polite statement, but it lacks the humility and respect conveyed by 「ご」
          and 「いたします」 when offering a service. We're looking to humbly offer an explanation.
    scene: A museum guide offering detailed information about an exhibit to visitors.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「ご説明 いたします」 uses 「ご」 to elevate the act of explaining, which benefits the listener. 「いたします」

          personal state. We're looking to politely ask about someone's well-being.

    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「ご気分 は いかがですか」 uses 「ご」 with 「気分」 (feeling/mood) to politely inquire about the listener's

          - 名前 を 使っ て も いい です か。
        english: May I use the name?

    register: formal
    setting: professional

          - いつ も 利用 いただき、本当 に ありがとう ござい ます。
        english: Thank you for always using our services.
        hint: This is more general and lacks the specific business-oriented polite nuance. 「ご愛顧」 is a
          specific term for patronage. We're looking for a formal expression of gratitude for continued
          business.
    scene: A store manager addressing a loyal, long-time customer.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「ご愛顧」 is a formal and respectful term meaning 'patronage' or 'favor', almost always used with
