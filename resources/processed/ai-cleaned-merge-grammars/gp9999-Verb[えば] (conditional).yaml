formation:
  Godan Verb (-u) + えば: Add えば to the Godan verb stem (changing the final -u sound to -e and adding ば).
    E.g., 書く (kaku) -> 書けば (kakeba), 読む (yomu) -> 読めば (yomeba).
  Ichidan Verb (-ru) + れば: Add れば to the Ichidan verb stem (remove る and add れば). E.g., 食べる (taberu) ->
    食べれば (tabereba), 見る (miru) -> 見れば (mireba).
  する → すれば: The irregular verb する conjugates to すれば.
  くる → くれば: The irregular verb くる conjugates to くれば.

etymology: The conditional particle 「ば」 originates from the classical Japanese conjunctive particle 「ば」
  (written as 葉 in some early texts), which was attached to the irrealis form (未然形) of verbs. Initially,
  it indicated a cause or reason, similar to 'because' or 'if'. Over time, its usage evolved to primarily
  express a conditional relationship, establishing a general or habitual consequence. The 'e' sound in
  the modern 「えば」 form for Godan verbs is a phonetic evolution that occurred to facilitate smoother pronunciation
  after the verb stem.
writeup: 'The 「ば」 conditional (Verb[えば]) is used to express a condition and its consequence, often implying
  a general truth, a habitual action, or a logical outcome. It is frequently seen in proverbs, rules,
  and statements where the relationship between the condition and the result is consistent or natural.Key
  Characteristics:   **General Truths and Habits**: It is commonly used for statements that are always
  true, or actions that habitually lead to a certain result. For example, 「春になれば暖かくなる」 (When spring comes,
  it gets warm).   **Advice and Suggestions**: When the subject of both the conditional clause and the
  main clause is the same, and the main clause expresses the speaker''s volitional action or strong request/command,
  「ば」 typically cannot be used. However, it can be used to give advice or suggestions, especially when
  the main clause describes a desired state or a positive outcome. For example, 「分からなければ、先生に聞けばいい」 (If
  you don''t understand, you should ask the teacher).   **Involuntary Actions/States**: The consequence
  clause often describes a natural or involuntary outcome, state, or discovery, rather than a conscious
  action or strong command by the speaker. For example, 「ボタンを押せば、ドアが開く」 (If you push the button, the door
  opens).   **Sequence of Actions**: While less common than 「〜てから」 or 「〜たら」, 「ば」 can sometimes indicate
  a sequential relationship between actions, especially when the second action naturally follows the first.
  For example, 「本を読めば読むほど、知識が増える」 (The more you read books, the more knowledge you gain).Common Combinations:   **～ば～ほど
  (the more… the more)**: This structure uses 「ば」 in the first clause and a plain form verb or adjective
  followed by 「ほど」 in the second, to express a proportional relationship. 「練習すればするほど、上手になる」 (The more
  you practice, the better you become).   **～ばいい (it would be good if..., should)**: This common pattern
  is used to give advice or express a desire for a certain outcome. 「もっと勉強すれば、合格するだろう」 (If you study more,
  you''ll probably pass).Important Considerations:   Unlike 「たら」, the 「ば」 conditional cannot be directly
  followed by volitional, imperative, or strong requests when the subject of both clauses is the same
  and the action is controlled by the speaker. For example, you cannot say 「明日雨が降れば、家で勉強しよう。」 instead
  you would say 「明日雨が降ったら、家で勉強しよう。」   While 「ば」 is generally applicable to verbs, for adjectives and nouns,
  other conditional forms like 「〜なら」 or 「〜ければ」/「〜であれば」 are used.'
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[たら] (conditional)
    meaning: if... then...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たら」 implies a conditional or temporal sequence, focusing on a specific, completed action.
      It can be used for unexpected outcomes, requests, or volitional statements in the result clause,
      unlike 「ば」. We're looking for a general conditional here.
    grammar_point: Verb[たら] (conditional)
  - term: と (conditional, inevitable result)
    meaning: if... then... (always happens)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「と」 is used for conditions where the result is a natural, automatic, or inevitable consequence,
      always true. 「ば」 expresses a general condition but not necessarily an inevitable one. We're looking
      for a general conditional here, not an an automatic or inevitable one.
    grammar_point: と (conditional, inevitable result)
  - term: なら (conditional, if it's the case that A)
    meaning: if it's the case that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なら」 introduces a condition based on a presumed or existing situation, often reacting to something
      heard or known. It usually implies that the speaker is giving advice or making a suggestion specific
      to that situation. 「ば」 is for more general conditions. We're looking for a general conditional here.
    grammar_point: なら (conditional, if it's the case that A)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the subtle differences between 「ば」, 「たら」, 「と」, and 「なら」 is crucial
  for natural Japanese. While all translate to 'if... then...', their specific nuances regarding generality,
  sequence, inevitability, and speaker intent vary. 「ば」 is best for general truths and advice where the
  condition naturally leads to the outcome, whereas the others have more specific applications for particular
  instances, automatic results, or reactions to stated facts.

    scene: You are showing someone how to use a device.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    nuance: This is a simple, general truth. Pushing the button always results in the door opening. The
      politeness comes from the 「ます」 form at the end.

      more informal but still polite.

      polite.

    register: formal
    setting: academic

        english: When you achieve your dreams, you always have to work hard.

    register: formal
    setting: inspirational
