formation:
  Noun + ぐるみ: Denotes the inclusion of an entire group or entity, emphasizing collective involvement or
    totality.
jlpt: N1
etymology: 'The suffix 「ぐるみ」 is believed to originate from the verb 「包む (くるむ - kurumu)」, meaning "to wrap,
  to envelop, to include." The sound change from ''ku'' to ''gu'' is a common phenomenon in Japanese called
  rendaku (連濁). This etymology underscores the core meaning of 「ぐるみ」: an action or state that ''wraps
  up'' or ''encompasses'' an entire entity or group, emphasizing complete inclusion.'
writeup: |-
  The suffix 「ぐるみ」 is attached to nouns, typically collective nouns, to indicate that an action or state involves the entirety of that group or entity. It signifies an 'all-inclusive' or 'whole' involvement, often implying a unified or collective effort. This contrasts with simply stating that 'everyone' or 'all parts' were involved, as 「ぐるみ」 emphasizes the entity as a cohesive unit.

  For instance, 「家族ぐるみ」 (kazoku gurumi) doesn't just mean "all family members"; it implies the *family as a whole*, acting in unison or being collectively responsible. Similarly, 「会社ぐるみ」 (kaisha gurumi) suggests that the *entire company*, from top to bottom, is united in an effort. It is frequently seen in contexts of collective action, support, or shared experience.

  While occasionally heard in casual conversation, 「ぐるみ」 lends a slightly formal or emphatic tone. It highlights thoroughness and full participation, making it a useful expression when you want to convey that no part or member of a designated group was left out.

  - term: 全部
    meaning: all, everything
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「全部」 is a general term for "all" or "everything," primarily referring to quantity or totality
      in a broad sense. 「ぐるみ」 specifically implies the *entirety* of a collective entity or the *inclusion*
      of all associated parts/people, often with a nuance of collective action or identity.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:全部 (all・everything)
  - term: 〜ごと
    meaning: entire, whole, including something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ごと」 can mean "whole" (e.g., eating a whole apple) or "including" (e.g., eating with the
      skin). While close, 「ぐるみ」 is more specifically about the *entirety of a group or organization* or
      an *all-encompassing effort* where members are actively involved. 「ごと」 often applies to individual
      items or their components; 「ぐるみ」 emphasizes the *involved collective parties*.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜ごと (entire・including)
  - term: 一切
    meaning: all, everything; absolutely (with negation)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「一切」 means "all" in a comprehensive sense, but it is very often used with negation (e.g.,
      「一切〜ない」 - not at all). While it denotes totality, it lacks the "collective involvement" nuance of
      「ぐるみ」. 「ぐるみ」 is about the *group* acting as a whole; 「一切」 is about the *quantity* or *complete absence*.
    grammar_point: 一切〜ない (not at all)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「全部」, 「〜ごと」, and 「一切」 all relate to the concept of 'wholeness' or 'completeness,'
  「ぐるみ」 distinctively focuses on the involvement of an *entire collective entity* or a *unified, all-encompassing
  effort*. 「全部」 serves as a general quantifier for 'all of something.' 「〜ごと」 can indicate consuming or
  handling an item in its entirety, or including certain parts, but it doesn't carry the same nuance of
  collective action among members of a group. 「一切」, often used in negative constructions, emphasizes absolute
  completeness or absence without the focus on group participation.
