    "etymology": "The grammar point 「というのは」 is derived from 「と」 (a quoting particle), 「言う」 (iu, to say), 「の」 (a nominalizer), and 「は」 (a topic marker). Literally, it means 「と言うことは」 'the thing that is said'.",
    "writeup": "「というのは」 combines the particle 「と」, the verb 「言う」 (to say), and the nominalizing particle 「の」 with the topic marker 「は」. It generally translates to \"~ known as ~ is~\", \"~ called ~ is~\", or simply \"~ means ~.\" It serves to introduce a phrase as a noun, which is then explained further by providing a definition or a reason. 「というのは」 is attached to the end of a phrase (A), indicating that an explanation (B) will follow.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「というのは」 is used to present facts or highlight points of discussion.\n*   Replacing 「は」 with 「も」 can indicate a rebuttal or extension of the original statement, implying that (B) has equal weight to (A).\n*   When used at the beginning of a new sentence, 「というのは」 can add extra information about what was previously said, similar to \"what I mean to say is ~\" or \"because of that ~.\"\n*   「というのは」 is often abbreviated as 「とは」 or 「って」 in casual speech, but the (B) explains (A) concept still applies.",
