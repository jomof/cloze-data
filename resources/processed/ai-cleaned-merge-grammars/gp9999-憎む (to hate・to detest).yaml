etymology: 憎む (nikumu) derives from the classical Japanese にくむ (nikumu), which conveyed the meaning of
  'to hate' or 'to detest.' The kanji 憎 itself inherently signifies hatred and animosity. Its origin can
  be traced back to the concept of being displeasing or 'ugly' (related to words like 憎い), which then
  evolved into a robust feeling of aversion and malice. It is a foundational word in Japanese for expressing
  intense, profound negative emotions, often implying a deep-seated animosity rather than a superficial
  dislike.
writeup: |-
  憎む (nikumu) is a transitive Godan verb meaning “to hate” or “to detest.” It expresses a strong, often enduring, negative emotion towards a person, group, concept, or object. Unlike 嫌う (kirau), which means “to dislike” and can be used for mild aversion, 憎む implies a deep-seated and intense feeling of hatred or animosity.

  This verb is typically used to describe emotions that are profound and potentially long-lasting, often related to actions, behaviors, or characteristics that are found utterly unacceptable or despicable. 憎む carries significant emotional weight, so its use should reflect the gravity of the feeling being conveyed. It is less common in casual conversation for minor dislikes and more often appears in contexts describing serious interpersonal conflicts, historical grievances, or moral condemnations. It is a powerful word to describe a profound sense of animosity.

    meaning: to dislike, to hate

    grammar_point: <suggest>:嫌う (to dislike)
  - term: 恨む (uramu)
    meaning: to resent, to bear a grudge
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 恨む focuses on the feeling of resentment or bitterness towards someone for a past wrong or
      perceived injustice. While related to negative feelings, it emphasizes the lingering grievance rather
      than pure hatred. 憎む is a broader term for hatred, not necessarily tied to a specific past act of
      wrongdoing.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:恨む (to resent)
  - term: 憎い (nikui)
    meaning: hateful, detestable (adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 憎い is an i-adjective meaning “hateful” or “detestable,” describing the quality of something
      that is hated or deserves hatred. It describes the object of hatred. 憎む is the verb, describing
      the act of hating.
    grammar_point: い-Adjectives (adjectives ending in い)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 憎む and 嫌う, consider the intensity of the emotion. 嫌う
  is for general dislike, much like “I don't like natto.” 憎む is for profound hatred, typically reserved
  for people, actions, or concepts that evoke a strong moral or emotional repulsion. 恨む is distinct in
  its focus on lingering resentment stemming from past grievances. While a person you 憎む you might also
  恨む, the core emotion emphasized is different. 憎い is an adjective describing something as an object of
  hatred, whereas 憎む is the action of hating.
