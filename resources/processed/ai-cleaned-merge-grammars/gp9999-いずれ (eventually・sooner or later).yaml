jlpt: N3
etymology: The word いずれ (izure) is thought to derive from いづれ (idure), an older form that originally meant
  'which one (of two or more)' or 'where.' Over time, its meaning shifted from indicating a choice or
  location to denoting an an unspecified future time or an inevitable outcome, retaining a sense of 'in
  one way or another' or 'at some point.' This evolution highlights how words for choice or place can
  develop temporal or modal meanings in Japanese.
writeup: '`いずれ` is a versatile adverb in Japanese that can express several related concepts: ''''eventually,''''
  ''''sooner or later,'''' ''''anyway,'''' or ''''in any case.'''' Its core nuance revolves around inevitability
  or a future state that will certainly arrive, often without specifying an exact time. It''s important
  to note that while `いずれ` can refer to a choice among possibilities in older or more formal contexts
  (like `いずれの道も険しい` - ''''Both paths are difficult''''), its more common modern adverbial use, especially
  for ''''eventually'''' or ''''anyway,'''' does not directly imply a choice but rather a definitive outcome.'
false_friends:
  - term: 結局
    meaning: after all, in the end
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While `結局` and `いずれ` both relate to outcomes, `結局` implies a conclusion or result reached
      after a process, often with a sense of finality or resignation. `いずれ` simply points to an inevitable
      future, without necessarily implying a long process or a specific conclusion, and without the nuance
      of 'as it turned out.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:結局 (after all・in the end)
  - term: そのうち
    meaning: eventually, before long
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Very close in meaning to `いずれ`. `そのうち` often implies 'in due course' or 'before long,' suggesting
      something will happen relatively soon or naturally without specific effort, and it feels slightly
      more casual. `いずれ` can convey a stronger sense of certainty or inevitability over a potentially
      longer or more unspecified period.
    grammar_point: そのうち (eventually・before long)
  - term: いずれにしても
    meaning: in any case, anyhow
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a common fixed phrase that explicitly uses `いずれ` to express 'in any case' or 'anyhow,'
      regardless of prior considerations. While `いずれ` itself can convey this meaning, `いずれにしても` is a set
      conjunction for connecting ideas.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:いずれにしても (in any case, anyhow)
  - term: 最終的に
    meaning: finally, ultimately
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`最終的に` clearly states a ''final'' outcome or step in a sequence. `いずれ` is less precise about
      the timing and focuses more on the certainty of the future event.'
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:最終的に (finally)
post_false_friends_writeup: While `いずれ` and `結局` both describe an outcome, `いずれ` indicates an inevitable
  future occurrence, whereas `結局` describes a conclusion reached after a process, often with a sense of
  'as it turned out.' `そのうち` is very similar to `いずれ` in meaning 'eventually,' but `そのうち` often feels
  more casual and suggests a natural, perhaps sooner, occurrence, while `いずれ` can imply a more definitive,
  albeit unspecified, future event. The phrase `いずれにしても` uses `いずれ` to mean 'in any case,' indicating
  that the statement holds true regardless of other possibilities. `最終的に` refers to a definitive 'final'
  stage.
