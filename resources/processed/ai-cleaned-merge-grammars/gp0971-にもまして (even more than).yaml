id: gp0971
meaning: Even -er than, Even more than, More than anybody, More than ever
pronunciation:
  katakana: ニモマシテ
  romaji: ni mo mashite
formation:
  Noun + に + も + まして: Indicates something is even more so than the noun.
jlpt: N1
etymology: The grammar point 「にもまして」 is derived from 「に」 (particle indicating direction or comparison),
  「も」 (particle indicating "even"), and the te-form of the verb 「増す」 (masu), which means "to increase".
  So, literally, it means "even increasing from".
writeup: 「にもまして」 is used to express that something has surpassed a certain level or standard, particularly
  when it indicates a significant increase or growth from a previous state. Its core meaning conveys **surpassing**
  or **exceeding** a prior state or comparison point. This construction is formed by combining the particle
  「に」 (indicating comparison or basis), the adverbial particle 「も」 (meaning "even"), and the te-form of
  the verb 「増す」 (masu), which means "to increase". Thus, it literally translates to "even increasing from
  (A), (B)". The particle 「に」 attaches to the noun serving as the comparison point. This pattern frequently
  appears with indefinite pronouns like 「誰」 ("who"), 「何」 ("what"), or 「いつ」 ("when"), in which cases it
  conveys "anyone", "anything", or "ever" respectively, emphasizing an exceptional degree.

  - term: より
    meaning: than, more than
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「より」 is a neutral comparative particle indicating a simple difference. 「にもまして」 emphasizes
      that something is *even more* or *exceptionally* so than the comparison point, implying a notable
      surpassing or exceeding. It conveys a stronger sense of degree and often surprise or emphasis.
    grammar_point: より (comparative)
  - term: 以上に
    meaning: more than, beyond
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「以上に」 broadly means 'more than' or 'beyond a certain level', 「にもまして」 specifically highlights
      an *increase* or *intensification* from a previous state or comparison point, suggesting an unexpected
      or remarkable surpassing. It carries a nuance of exceeding what was already significant.
    grammar_point: 以上に (more than expected)
  - term: まして
    meaning: To say nothing of; not to speak of; let alone; still more; much less; all the more reason
      why
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「まして」 can imply a stronger degree or logical consequence, similar to 「にもまして」. However, 「にもまして」
      *always* emphasizes that something is *even more* or *exceptionally* so *compared to a specified
      point or standard*, often implying a remarkable surpassing. 「まして」 often means "furthermore, much
      more so" in a sequential or logical sense, or "let alone" in a negative context, which is broader.
      「にもまして」 is more focused on the *intensification beyond a comparison point*.
    grammar_point: まして(や) (even more so)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing among 「にもまして」, 「より」, 「以上に」, and 「まして」, consider the specific
  nuance you wish to convey. Use 「より」 for straightforward comparisons indicating a simple difference.
  Opt for 「以上に」 when something exceeds a general threshold or quantity. Use 「まして」 for logical amplification,
  meaning 'furthermore, much more so,' or 'let alone' in negative contexts. However, when you want to
  express that something has intensified or surpassed a previous state or comparison point in an exceptionally
  remarkable and emphatic way, 「にもまして」 is the most precise choice.

    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The phrase 「心 を 揺さぶる」 (kokoro o yusaburu - to shake one's heart) combined with 「にもまして」 conveys
      a strong, almost overwhelming emotional impact, suggesting a significant increase in the effect
      compared to her past performances, which implies a noticeable surpassing of previous expectations.
    etymology: The verb 「揺さぶる」 (yusaburu) literally means "to shake forcefully" or "to sway", and when
      combined with 「心」 (kokoro), it creates a powerful image of emotional impact or agitation, as if
      one's heart is being physically moved. This emphasizes the profound effect the singing voice has
      on the listener, reflecting a deeper level of engagement than a simple emotional response might
      imply.

    nuance: 「いつにもまして」 implies that the current feeling of loneliness is *more intense* or *deeper* than
