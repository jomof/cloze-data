    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たがる」 is formed by combining the auxiliary verb 「たい」 (tai), which expresses the speaker's desire to do something, with the verb 「がる」 (garu), which indicates a feeling or behavior is being exhibited by someone other than the speaker. Thus, 「たがる」 essentially means \"to show signs of wanting to do something,\" referring to a third person's apparent desire.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「たがる」, is used to express that someone *appears* or *acts like* they want to do something. It is used exclusively for third persons, not the speaker themselves. You learned about 「がる」already, and this is another place it appears. It is formed by attaching 「たい」 to the ます stem of a verb and then replacing the い of 「たい」 with 「がる」. Think of it as \"wanting to want\" something. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「たがる」 contrasts with 「てほしい」, which means \"to want someone to do (A).\" The nuance is different: 「たがる」 describes an observed behavior, while 「てほしい」 expresses a direct desire.\n*   It also contrasts with the い-adjective 「ほしい」. To describe that someone seems like they want something (rather than wanting to *do* something), 「がる」 will be paired with this adjective, forming 「ほしがる」.",
