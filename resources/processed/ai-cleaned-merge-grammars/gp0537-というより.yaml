        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "To refine or correct a preceding statement by offering a more accurate or appropriate alternative.",
        "nuance": "The phrase 『というより』 is used to introduce a statement that is presented as a more precise, suitable, or insightful characterization compared to the preceding one. It implies a subjective re-evaluation or a deeper understanding of the situation. The part of the sentence after 『というより』 is always considered to be the 'truer' or 'better' description."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「と」 (a quotation particle), 「言う」 (iu, to say), and 「より」 (yori, than). The combination creates a structure that compares two statements, suggesting the latter is more accurate or suitable.",
    "writeup": "『というより』 is a grammatical construction used to clarify or correct a previous statement by offering a more accurate or fitting description. It translates roughly to \"rather than saying (A), it's more like (B)\" or \"(B) is more of a... than (A)\". The nuance conveyed is that while the first statement (A) might be plausible, the second statement (B) provides a superior or more insightful characterization. It functions as a way to refine perception or articulate a more precise truth.\n\nThis expression is formed by combining the quotation particle 『と』, the verb 『言う』 (iu, \"to say\"), and the comparative particle 『より』 (\"than\"). The phrase literally means \"than saying...\", which naturally leads to the meaning of choosing a better description over a less accurate one.\n\n『というより』 can follow various parts of speech:\n*   **Verbs (dictionary form):** Verb + 『というより』\n*   **I-adjectives (plain form):** I-adjective + 『というより』\n*   **Na-adjectives (stem form):** Na-adjective stem + 『だというより』 (The 『だ』 is often omitted in casual speech).\n*   **Nouns:** Noun + 『だというより』 (The 『だ』 is often omitted in casual speech).\n\nIt is important to remember that the particle 『より』, in all its uses, emphasizes what is 'less' or inferior. Therefore, the statement introduced by 『というより』 (the 'B' part) will always describe something that is considered 'more accurate', 'closer to the truth', 'more intense', or 'more appropriate' than the preceding statement (the 'A' part). While grammatically 「は」 can follow 「より」 (e.g., 『というよりは』), it typically functions to add emphasis to the contrast, making the distinction more pronounced. In daily conversation, 『というより』 without 「は」 is common.",
