    "etymology": "「と言う」 (to say) + 「より」 (than). It indicates a comparison where the latter part of the statement is considered a more accurate or appropriate description than the former.",
    "writeup": "「というより」 is used to suggest that a more accurate description follows. It's similar to saying \"rather than\" or \"more...than...\" in English. It indicates that while the first part of the statement may have some validity, the second part is more fitting. The nuance of 「より」 highlights that the second part is 'more' accurate. When used with nouns and な-adjectives, 「だ」 is often added, though it may be omitted in casual speech.",
