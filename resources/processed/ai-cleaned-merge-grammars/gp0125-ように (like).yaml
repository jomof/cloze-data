    "etymology": "Derived from the noun 「様 (よう)」 meaning 'state,' 'appearance,' or 'way.' The particle 「に」 turns it into an adverbial form, indicating 'in the manner of' or 'like'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ように」 (youni) functions as an adverbial phrase to express similarity, resemblance, or manner. It translates broadly to \"like,\" \"as,\" or \"as if.\" This form connects a preceding clause or word to describe how an action is performed or how something appears.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish this usage from 「ように」 that expresses purpose or a wish (e.g., 「日本語 が 話せる よう に なる」 - 'to become able to speak Japanese'). While both share the same phonetic form, their grammatical functions and contextual meanings are entirely different.\n\n「ように」 can attach to various word types:\n*   **Verbs**: Attach to the plain (dictionary or plain past) form of a verb. This indicates that an action is performed in a way that resembles the verb's action or state.\n*   **い-Adjectives**: Attach to the plain (present or plain past) form of an い-adjective. This conveys that something possesses a quality or state resembling that adjective.\n*   **な-Adjectives**: Use the stem of the な-adjective followed by 「な」 for present tense or 「だった」 for past tense. This indicates a resemblance to the characteristic described by the adjective.\n*   **Nouns**: Use the noun followed by 「の」 for present tense or 「だった」 for past tense. This signifies that something is similar to or behaves like the noun.\n\nThis grammar point is versatile and appears frequently in both spoken and written Japanese to add descriptive depth by drawing comparisons.",
