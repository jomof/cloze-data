jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  function: Indicates that the subject undergoes an action or is affected by it, often implying a natural
    occurrence, a state, or an action by an external agent. It shifts the focus from the actor to the
    recipient of the action.
  nuance: The passive voice can sometimes imply a sense of misfortune or an action occurring against one's
    will, especially when the agent is explicitly stated with 「に」. However, it is also used neutrally
    in formal or objective contexts (e.g., news reports) or to describe natural occurrences. The agent
    is often omitted if it's unknown, unimportant, or obvious.
  grammatical-role: Transforms a transitive or intransitive verb into a form where the original object
    (or the subject of an intransitive verb) becomes the new subject, receiving the action. The original
    agent, if mentioned, is marked by 「に」.
  logical-flow: Reverses the direction of the action from agent-to-object to object-receiving-action.
  temporal-flow: Does not inherently change the temporal flow; it describes an action completed or experienced
    by the subject at a given time.
etymology: The Japanese passive forms 「れる」 and 「られる」 originate from the classical Japanese auxiliary verbs
  「る」 and 「らる」. These older forms conveyed both passive and potential meanings. Over centuries, while
  the passive function solidified primarily with 「れる/えられる」, the potential meaning diversified, leading
  to distinct potential verb forms (e.g., Godan verbs like 「読める」) and the analytical construction 「～ことができる」.
  The differentiation between 「れる」 for Godan verbs and 「られる」 for Ichidan verbs (and irregular verbs like
  「来る」 and 「する」) is largely phonetic, designed to make pronunciation smoother and to avoid a repetition
  of 'r' sounds that would occur if 「られる」 were used uniformly across all verb types.
writeup: |-
  The passive voice in Japanese is formed by adding 「れる」 or 「られる」 to the verb stem, depending on the verb group. This construction allows the subject of the sentence to be the recipient of an action, rather than the performer. The agent (the one performing the action) can be indicated using the particle 「に」, but it is very common for the agent to be omitted, especially if it is unknown, unimportant, or clear from context.

  For **Godan verbs**, you change the final 「う」 sound to an 「あ」 sound and add 「れる」. For example, 「飲む (nomu - to drink)」 becomes 「飲まれる (nomareru - to be drunk)」.

  For **Ichidan verbs**, you drop the final 「る」 and add 「られる」. For example, 「食べる (taberu - to eat)」 becomes 「食べられる (taberareru - to be eaten)」.

  **Irregular verbs** have their own passive forms: 「する (suru - to do)」 becomes 「される (sareru - to be done)」, and 「来る (kuru - to come)」 becomes 「来られる (korareru - to be come to or visited by)」.

  While the passive voice is widely used, it often carries a nuance of the subject being affected by an external force or situation, sometimes implying a negative or undesirable outcome. However, it is also frequently used in neutral or objective contexts, such as news reports, scientific writing, or when describing natural phenomena.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[potential] (can do)
    meaning: can do, able to do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 'Passive voice expresses that the subject *receives* an action, whereas the potential form
      expresses the subject''s *ability* to perform an action. For Godan verbs, the forms are distinct
      (e.g., 「読む (yomu)」: passive 「読まれる」, potential 「読める」). However, for Ichidan verbs, the forms are
      identical (e.g., 「食べる (taberu)」: passive 「食べられる」, potential 「食べられる」), requiring context to differentiate.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[potential] (can do)
  - term: させられる (causative-passive)
    meaning: to be made to do, to be forced to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both involve the subject being acted upon, the causative-passive specifically means
      being *forced* or *caused* to perform an action by someone else, often implying an unwilling participation
      or negative feeling. The simple passive (「～れる/えられる」) means undergoing an action without the explicit
      nuance of coercion.

  - term: お[Verb-stem]になる・なさる・いらっしゃる (respectful action - sonkeigo)
    meaning: respectful form of verbs
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: The passive forms can also be used as honorifics (尊敬語) to elevate the status of the person
      performing the action (e.g., 「先生が話される (Sensei speaks)」). In this usage, there is no implied external
      agent; the honorific simply expresses respect for the subject. Context is crucial for distinguishing
      between passive and honorific usage.
    grammar_point: お[Verb-stem]になる・なさる・いらっしゃる (respectful action - sonkeigo)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the distinction between the passive, potential, and honorific
  forms of verbs is crucial. While their constructions may overlap, especially for Ichidan verbs and in
  honorific usage, their fundamental meanings differ. The passive describes what *happens to* the subject,
  the potential describes what the subject *can do*, and honorifics simply show *respect* to the subject's
  actions. Always consider the context, the presence of an agent (marked by 「に」 for passive), and the
  overall politeness level to correctly interpret these forms.

    scene: A historian is explaining the origin of a local festival.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: passive (～られる/～かれる)
    nuance: The use of 「受け継がれています」 (passive + ~ている) indicates a continuous state of the tradition being
      passed down. The agent 'people' is implied and not explicitly stated with 「に」, making the focus
      entirely on the tradition itself, which is common in formal and informative contexts.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: This is a common use of the passive voice to express being affected by an action, particularly
      when the action is somewhat impersonal or done by a figure of authority like 「先生」. The subject 「私」
      is omitted but implied, and the agent 「先生」 is marked with 「に」. While 「先生が私の名前を呼びました」 is also grammatically
      correct, the passive 「呼ばれました」 often feels more natural when the speaker wants to highlight their
      experience of being called.
  - english: My favorite mug was accidentally broken by my little brother.
    japanese:
      - お 気 に 入り の マグ カップ を 弟 に {割ら れ ちゃい まし た}。

        hint: This active sentence highlights the brother's action. We need the mug to be the subject,
          and the speaker expresses misfortune about it.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 弟 は お 気 に 入り の マグ カップ を 割ら せ まし た。
        english: My little brother made someone break my favorite mug. (causative)
        hint: This implies the brother *caused* someone to break it. We're looking for the mug being broken
          *by* the brother, with a nuance of misfortune for the speaker.
    scene: You discover your treasured mug in pieces.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of 「割られちゃいました」 combines the passive voice 「割られる」 with the 「～ちゃう」 contraction of 「～てしまう」,
      adding a nuance of completion, regret, or an accidental occurrence. The particle 「に」 marks the agent
      「弟」, and the entire phrase implies the speaker's personal misfortune or slight annoyance at their
      younger brother's action.
post_example_writeup: The passive voice is a versatile grammatical tool that can shift sentence focus,
  describe unfortunate events, or convey objective information. Pay close attention to context when encountering
  sentences that could be interpreted as passive, potential, or honorific, as the shared verb endings
  can sometimes lead to confusion. Practice distinguishing these usages by considering who is doing what
  to whom, and the implied feelings or formality of the speaker.
