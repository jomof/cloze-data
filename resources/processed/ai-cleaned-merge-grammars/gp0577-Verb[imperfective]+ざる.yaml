    "etymology": "「ざる」 is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「ず」, indicating negation. 「ず」 itself is derived from older forms of negation in Japanese. It carries the same 'not' meaning as 「ない」, but is more formal and literary. Some dictionaries list 「ざる」 as the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「ざり」. However, 「ざり」 itself is just a contraction of 「ず」 and 「あり」 'to be'. Due to this, both variations may be considered as correct, with 「ず」 being the underlying origination.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[imperfective]+ざる」 represents the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「ず」, expressing negation. It holds a meaning equivalent to 「ない」, but carries a significantly more formal, literary, and sometimes archaic tone. You will primarily encounter 「ざる」 in written contexts such as historical texts, news articles, academic papers, or established idiomatic expressions.\n\nWhile 「ざる」 functions similarly to 「ない」, its use in modern spoken Japanese is largely confined to specific set phrases. For instance, it is a key component of the common grammar structure 「〜ざるを得ない」 (to have no choice but to...). Using 「ざる」 in casual conversation outside of these fixed expressions would sound unnatural or overly stiff.\n\nCharacteristic of its older grammatical origins, when combined with the irregular verb 「する」, 「ざる」 connects to its classical 「せ」 stem, resulting in 「せざる」, rather than the more common modern 「し」 stem.",

Therefore, while you might say 「彼は来ず」 (He didn't come) or 「彼は来ない」 (He doesn't come), you would use 「来ざる者」 (a person who does not come) to describe someone in a literary context.
