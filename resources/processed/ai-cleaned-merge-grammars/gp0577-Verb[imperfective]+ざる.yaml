    "etymology": "ざる is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb ず (zu), indicating negation. ず is related to ない (nai), the modern negative auxiliary verb. ざる itself is a contraction of ず and ある (aru) 'to be'.",
    "writeup": "ざる is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb ず. It carries the same negation meaning as ない but sounds more formal and literary. It's often translated as \"un-\" when used as a prefix. You'll often see ざる attached to verbs to describe a noun directly after it.\n\nAlthough ざる can replace ない, it's primarily used in common expressions or sayings, such as ざるを得ない (zaru o enai) \"have no choice but to (A).\" This grammar is mostly encountered in writing, and very rarely in casual speech.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   As with many old-fashioned grammar patterns, ざる conjugates with the せ-stem of する (suru) rather than the more modern し-stem.",
