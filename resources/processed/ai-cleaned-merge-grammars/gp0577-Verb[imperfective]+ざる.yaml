    "etymology": "「ざる」 is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「ず」, indicating negation. 「ず」 itself is derived from older forms of negation in Japanese. It carries the same 'not' meaning as 「ない」, but is more formal and literary. Some dictionaries list 「ざる」 as the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「ざり」. However, 「ざり」 itself is just a contraction of 「ず」 and 「あり」 'to be'. Due to this, both variations may be considered as correct, with 「ず」 being the underlying origination.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, `Verb[imperfective]+ざる`, represents the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb `ず`, expressing negation. It is equivalent to `ない` in meaning but carries a significantly more formal and literary tone. You will primarily encounter `ざる` in written contexts such as news articles, academic texts, or established expressions. Its use in spoken modern Japanese is largely confined to specific set phrases, such as `〜ざるを得ない` (to have no choice but to...). Note that, characteristic of older grammatical patterns, `ざる` when attached to the verb `する` will connect to its classical `せ` stem, forming `せざる`, rather than the modern `し` stem.",
