jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General use in everyday conversation and writing.
  function: Expresses that despite a certain condition or situation, the result or outcome in the main
    clause is contrary to expectation or remains unchanged.
  nuance: Implies a concessive conditional relationship. The emphasis is on the fact that the action or
    state in the main clause occurs or remains true regardless of the condition stated in the preceding
    clause. Can convey resilience, acceptance, or unexpected outcomes.
etymology: The grammar point 「ても」 is a combination of the 「て」-form of a verb or adjective and the particle
  「も」. The 「て」-form serves as a conjunctive particle, linking clauses and sometimes indicating a temporal
  sequence, cause, or means. The particle 「も」, in this context, adds the nuance of 'even,' 'also,' or
  'likewise,' creating a concessive conditional meaning. Historically, this construction evolved from
  simply linking clauses with 「て」 and then adding 「も」 to emphasize the unexpected nature of the outcome
  despite the preceding condition.
writeup: The 「ても」 grammar pattern is used to express 'even if,' 'even though,' or 'no matter how/what.'
  It indicates that despite the condition or situation described in the first clause, the event or state
  in the second clause still occurs or remains true, often contrary to expectation. This makes it a crucial
  pattern for conveying resilience, acceptance, or unexpected results. To form 「ても」:For verbs, conjugate
  them into their **て-form** and add 「も」. For example, 食べる (to eat) becomes 食べても (even if one eats).For
  **い-adjectives**, remove the final 「い」 and add 「くても」. For example, 寒い (cold) becomes 寒くても (even if it's
  cold).For **な-adjectives**, add 「でも」. For example, 静か (quiet) becomes 静かでも (even if it's quiet).For
  **nouns**, add 「でも」. For example, 学生 (student) becomes 学生でも (even if one is a student).This pattern
  is highly versatile and frequently encountered in daily Japanese. It can also be used to highlight negative
  sentences, translating similarly to 'even if not (A)' or 'even though not (A)'. For instance, 行かなくても
  (even if I don't go) or 好きじゃなくても (even if I don't like it).
false_friends:
  - term: 〜てもいい
    meaning: It's okay to; it's alright to; can/may
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「ても」, which expresses a concessive condition ('even if A, then B'), 「～てもいい」 expresses
      permission or allowance ('It's okay to do A'). The nuance shifts from 'despite' to 'permitted'.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て]+もいい (permission)
  - term: でも
    meaning: Even; or something; any (with question words); no matter (who/what/where/when)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「でも」 can function as a conjunction ('but, however') connecting two independent clauses, or
      as a particle meaning 'or something'/'any' when following a question word. These uses are distinct
      from the concessive particle 「ても」.
    grammar_point: でも (even・any・no matter)
  - term: ～ようが～まいが
    meaning: Even if; no matter what; whether or not (emphatic)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～ようが～まいが」 is a more emphatic and often literary way to express 'whether or not' or 'no matter
      what,' indicating a complete indifference to the outcome. It carries a stronger sense of 'it makes
      no difference' compared to the broader 'even if' of 「ても」.
    grammar_point: ようが〜まいが (regardless of whether)
  - term: もし
    meaning: If (for emphasis)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「もし」 is an adverb that emphasizes a hypothetical condition, typically preceding a conditional
      like 「～ば」, 「～たら」, or 「～なら」. While it sets up a 'if' scenario, it does not inherently carry the concessive
      'even though' nuance of 「ても」.
    grammar_point: もし・もしも (if, emphasis)
  - term: ～にしても
    meaning: Even if, Even though, No matter what, Also
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～にしても」 is often used to introduce additional considerations or to make a concession based
      on a statement or assumption. It can convey 'even if that is the case' or 'even considering that,'
      implying a broader context than the simple 'even if' of 「ても」.
    grammar_point: にしても (even if)
  - term: ～としても
    meaning: Even if (we assume), Assuming, Also as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～としても」 specifically focuses on a hypothetical assumption or a presumption. It means 'even
      assuming that...' or 'even if it's considered that...'. While similar in meaning, it emphasizes
      the assumed nature of the condition more strongly than 「ても」.
    grammar_point: としても (even if assumed)
  - term: ～にせよ・～にしろ
    meaning: Even if, Even though, No matter, Whether… or
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～にせよ」 and 「～にしろ」 are more formal and often used to present two contrasting options, implying
      'whether A or B, the result is the same.' This binary or exhaustive concession differs from 「ても」,
      which can apply to a single condition.
    grammar_point: 〜にせよ・〜にしろ・〜であれ (even if・no matter what)
  - term: さえ
    meaning: Even; if only; as long as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The particle 「さえ」 means 'even' but often emphasizes a minimum requirement or an extreme case.
      For example, 'even a child' (子供さえ) can do something, highlighting that if the easiest case can do
      it, others surely can. It marks an inclusive extreme, whereas 「ても」 focuses on concession despite
      a condition.
    grammar_point: さえ (even・if only)
  - term: たとえ～ても
    meaning: Even if…is the case, Supposing that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たとえ～ても」 is a more emphatic and formal version of 「ても」. 「たとえ」 (even if, granted that) explicitly
      introduces a hypothetical or concessive situation, often used in written or more formal speech to
      stress the 'even if' aspect strongly.
    grammar_point: たとえ〜ても (even if)
  - term: ～たって
    meaning: Even if, Even though, No matter how
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～たって」 is a more casual and colloquial variant of 「ても」, commonly used in informal conversations.
      It carries the same concessive meaning but with a relaxed tone.
    grammar_point: たって (even if)
  - term: 〜ても〜ても
    meaning: No matter how much/often/hard/etc.; no matter how many times
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ても」 expresses a general 'even if' concession, the repetition in 「〜ても〜ても」 specifically
      emphasizes repeated effort or a continuous state, highlighting that the outcome remains the same
      despite continuous or exhaustive attempts.
    grammar_point: 〜ても〜ても (repeated effort or state)
  - term: たところで
    meaning: Even if; even though; no matter how much
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ても」 simply expresses a concession ('even if A, then B'), 「たところで」 implies that the action
      in the first clause is futile or will not lead to the desired outcome, often followed by a negative
      result. It carries a nuance of resignation or a sense that 'it won't make a difference'.
    grammar_point: (にし)たところで (even if)
  - term: にもかかわらず
    meaning: Despite, in spite of, regardless, nevertheless
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にもかかわらず」 is more formal than 「ても」 and strongly emphasizes that something happened or is true
      **despite** a preceding condition, often one that would logically prevent it. It highlights a stronger
      contrast or unexpectedness than 「ても」, which can be a simple 'even if'.
    grammar_point: (いかん)に(も)かかわらず (regardless of)
post_false_friends_writeup: When using 「ても」, it is essential to distinguish it from similar-sounding expressions.
  For instance, 「～てもいい」 expresses permission, whereas 「ても」 denotes a concession. Similarly, the conjunction
  「でも」 ('but, however') is distinct from the concessive particle 「ても」. Other expressions like 「たとえ～ても」
  provide a more emphatic or formal alternative, while 「～たって」 serves as its casual counterpart. Understanding
  these nuances is key to accurate and natural Japanese communication.
examples:
  - english: Even if I practice every day, I can't really get good.
    japanese:
      - 毎日 練習 し {て も}、なかなか 上手 に なれ ませ ん。
      - 毎日 練習 し {て も}、なかなか 上手 に なれ ない。
      - 毎日 練習 し {たっ て}、なかなか 上手 に なれ ない よ。
    english_literally: Every day practice do even if, quite good at cannot become.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 毎日 練習 すれ {ば}、上手 に なれ ます。
        english: If I practice every day, I can get good.
        hint: The grammar point is for 'even if/though', indicating that the result occurs despite the
          condition. We're looking for a sentence that conveys frustration that effort doesn't lead to
          improvement.
    scene: A student expressing frustration about their slow progress in a new skill.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker is a young man. The phrase 「なかなか～ない」 emphasizes the difficulty of improving despite
      effort. The final 「なれません」 uses the polite negative potential form, which is common in casual conversation
      to express an inability.
    etymology: The term 「なかなか」 (difficult to, not easily) is often paired with negative verbs to express
      difficulty in achieving something.
  - english: No matter how busy you are, you have to eat properly.
    japanese:
      - どんな に 忙しく {て も}、食事 は ちゃんと 摂ら ない と。

          - もし 忙しい {なら}、食事 は ちゃんと 摂ら ない と。
        english: If you are busy, you have to eat properly.
        hint: The grammar point emphasizes 'no matter how' or 'even if', conveying that the rule applies
          regardless of the degree of business. We're looking for a stronger emphasis on the concession.
    scene: A concerned mother reminding her college student child about their health.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「どんなに～ても」 adds emphasis, meaning 'no matter how much.' The phrase 「摂らないと」 is a casual contraction
      of 「摂らないといけない」, meaning 'you have to take/eat,' and is typically used by an older person speaking
      to a younger one. The use of 「ちゃんと」 emphasizes doing something properly.
    etymology: 「摂る」 (to take/eat) is a more formal or clinical verb often used for consuming food or medicine,
      in contrast to more casual 「食べる」 (to eat).

        english: She is a little clumsy, but she is a very kind person.
        hint: While 'but' can connect contrasting ideas, the grammar point specifically means 'even if'
          or 'even though', highlighting an unexpected outcome despite the initial condition. We're looking
          for a sentence that emphasizes this concession.
    scene: Friends discussing a mutual acquaintance's personality.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「不器用でも」 illustrates the concession for a な-adjective. The use of 「です」 maintains a semi-formal
      tone while describing a personal observation.

          - この 問題 は、子供 が 解ける {くらい} 簡単 だ。
        english: This problem is easy enough that a child can solve it.
        hint: The grammar point adds emphasis, meaning 'even a child,' highlighting that it's easy for
          someone who might typically find it difficult. We're looking for an emphasis on the inclusiveness
          of 'even'.
    scene: A teacher reviewing a math problem with a class, emphasizing its simplicity.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「子供でも」 shows the concessive use with a noun, emphasizing that even a child (who might typically
      struggle) can do it. 「～くらい簡単だ」 means 'it's easy to the extent that...'. The use of plain form 「だ」
      for a declarative statement is common in instructional settings.

        english: If it doesn't rain, there's no need to take an umbrella.
        hint: The grammar point expresses a concessive 'even if not', meaning the action is taken regardless
          of the condition. We're looking for a sentence that implies caution despite a potential lack
          of rain.
    scene: A group of friends planning an outing, considering potential weather changes.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)

        english: She was utterly exhausted, but she never stopped smiling.
        hint: Using 'が' offers a simple contrast, but the grammar point emphasizes the strong concessive
          'even though', highlighting the unexpected persistence of her smile despite extreme exhaustion.
          We're looking for a stronger sense of concession.
    scene: Observing a performer who has just finished a long and demanding show.

    scene: You're at a shop, looking at an item you really like but it's a bit pricey.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: optimistic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female

      The sentence conveys a strong intention to purchase, even in the face of a high price, which is
      why 「ても」 is more fitting than a simple "but".
  - english: Even if you don't understand, you must continue studying.

        hint: The grammar point means 'even if not', emphasizing persistence regardless of immediate comprehension.
          We're looking for a sentence that conveys the necessity of continuing study despite lack of
          understanding.
    scene: A teacher encouraging a struggling student not to give up.
    register: formal
    setting: inspirational
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「分からなくても」 uses the negative て-form + も for a verb. The phrase 「～なければなりません」 indicates obligation
      or necessity. This sentence is a strong encouragement, highlighting that effort is required even
      when results are not immediately apparent, a common sentiment from teachers.

          - 車 で 行く {と}、2 時間 かかり ます。
        english: If you go by car, it will take 2 hours.
        hint: The grammar point means 'even if', suggesting that taking the car (which might seem faster)
          won't save much time. We're looking for a sentence that expresses this concession.
    scene: Someone asking about travel time, and being told that even the fastest method will take a certain
      amount of time.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「車でも」 uses the noun + でも formation. This phrase emphasizes that even with the seemingly fastest
      mode of transport (car), the journey still takes a considerable amount of time, implying that other
      modes might take even longer or that the distance is simply far.
post_example_writeup: The 「ても」 construction is highly versatile, conveying the sense of "even if" or "even
  though" across a wide range of situations. As seen in the examples, it attaches to verbs, い-adjectives,
  な-adjectives, and nouns, allowing for nuanced expression of concession. Remember that the negative form,
  「なくても」, means "even if not," altering the meaning to express an outcome that occurs despite a negative
  condition. For continuous states or actions, the progressive form 「ていても」 can be used.
