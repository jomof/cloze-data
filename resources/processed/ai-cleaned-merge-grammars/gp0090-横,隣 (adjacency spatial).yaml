        "function": "To specify relative location.",
        "nuance": "横 can mean 'side' (as in the side of a car) or 'next to' (as in 'next to the building'). It has a broader sense of 'beside' or 'horizontal direction'. 隣 specifically means 'immediately next to', like a neighbor's house or the seat next to you.",

    },
    "etymology": "「横」 (yoko) originally denoted the 'horizontal direction' or 'breadth', stemming from the idea of something laid flat or extending across. Its meaning evolved to include 'beside' in a general sense. 「隣」 (tonari) is believed to derive from the ancient Japanese verb 「と成る」 (to naru), meaning 'to become joined' or 'to form a pair with', emphasizing the direct, immediate adjacency. This etymological distinction highlights why 横 is broader (horizontal orientation, general side) and 隣 is more specific (direct, immediate adjacency, sharing a boundary).",
    "writeup": "Both 「横」 (yoko) and 「隣」 (tonari) are used to express proximity in Japanese, but they carry distinct nuances that are crucial for accurate communication. Understanding their differences is key to sounding natural.横 (yoko) primarily refers to the 'side' of something, or 'beside' in a more general sense. It can indicate a horizontal direction or position. Think of it as 'on the side of' or 'to the side'. For example, if you say 車 の 横 (kuruma no yoko), it means 'the side of the car' or 'next to the car' in a way that doesn't necessarily imply immediate, direct contact or sharing a boundary. It's often used when describing general adjacency or orientation.隣 (tonari), on the other hand, strictly means 'immediately next to' or 'neighboring'. It implies that there is nothing in between the two things, and they are often of the same type or category, or share a direct boundary. For instance, if you are sitting on a train and someone is in the seat right beside you, they are あなた の 隣 (anata no tonari). If you are talking about the house next door, it is 隣 の 家 (tonari no ie).Consider the difference with people: if you are standing next to someone, either could potentially work, but 「隣」 emphasizes that they are *right* there, shoulder-to-shoulder, while 「横」 might just mean they are in the general vicinity to your side. When describing inanimate objects, 「隣」 is used for items in a row or array that are immediately adjacent, like books on a shelf or buildings on a street.Important Considerations:Use 「横」 when the relationship is more about general proximity or being 'to the side' of something, or when referring to the side *surface* of an object.Use 「隣」 when emphasizing direct, immediate adjacency, often implying a shared boundary or items within the same category/line.",
