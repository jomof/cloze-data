    "etymology": "This grammar point is a combination of 「こと」 (koto, a thing or matter), the particle 「に」 (ni, indicating a state or condition), the topic marker 「は」 (wa), and the negative form of the verb 「なる」 (naru, to become). Literally, it means something along the lines of \"it will not become that thing/matter.\"",
    "writeup": "「ことにはならない」 is an expression used to emphasize that a statement made earlier is not necessarily true. It often follows structures like 「ても」 (\"even if\") or 「からといって」 (\"just because\"). It highlights that \"it will not be that (B).\" The entire expression can be interpreted as \"just because (A), it doesn't mean that (B).\" Though not required, the (B) expression may be further emphasized by including 「という」 before 「ことにはならない」.",
