    "etymology": "ところ (tokoro) literally means \"place\" or \"spot.\" In this grammar, it refers to a specific point in time or a situation. に (ni) and へ (e) are particles indicating direction or location, further emphasizing the \"place\" or \"time\" where something occurs.",
    "writeup": "ところに / ところへ highlights the time of an action or state. It can be interpreted as \"at the time of,\" \"when,\" or \"while.\" Because it uses the noun ところ (place/spot), it emphasizes the scene or situation more than the action itself.\n\n*   This pattern follows verbs in the ている or ていた forms.\n*   へ is sometimes used instead of に.\n\nDepending on the verb form, ところに may indicate being \"on the verge of,\" \"partway through,\" or having \"just finished.\" The addition of に or へ often precedes a statement indicating that at the moment of A, B happened, which may be positive or negative.",
