    "etymology": "「前 (mae)」 means \"front\" or \"before.\" に (ni) is a particle indicating location or time. Thus, 「まえに」 literally combines these meanings to indicate a position in front of something or a point in time before something else.",
    "writeup": "「前に」 indicates something that is \"before\" in either a temporal or spatial sense. It can mean \"before\" an action (in time) or \"in front of\" an object (location). When used with verbs, they must be in their dictionary form. When used with nouns, the particle 「の」 is required before 「前に」. 「前に」 is a versatile term applicable to various contexts.",
