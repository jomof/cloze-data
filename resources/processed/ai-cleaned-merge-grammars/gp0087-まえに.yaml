        "particle-syntactic-function": "case-marking",
        "usage-context": "Used to denote temporal precedence or spatial position.",
        "function": "Indicates time before an event or location in front of something.",
        "nuance": "Can be used for both temporal (before) and spatial (in front of) meanings, depending on the context of the preceding word.",
        "source": "Bunpro, DOJG"
    },
    "etymology": "「前 (mae)」 means \"front\" or \"before.\" に (ni) is a particle indicating location or time. Thus, 「まえに」 literally combines these meanings to indicate a position in front of something or a point in time before something else.",
    "writeup": "「まえに」 is a versatile particle that indicates either **temporal precedence** (before an action or event) or **spatial position** (in front of something). Its meaning depends entirely on the context and the type of word it follows. For example, it does not mean \"the past\" or \"previously.\" \n\nWhen used with **verbs**, the verb must be in its plain, non-past (dictionary) form. This construction signifies that the action described by 「まえに」 occurs prior to the action of the main verb in the sentence. For example, 「食べる前に」 means \"before eating,\" indicating that a certain action will be performed before the act of eating.\n\nWhen used with **nouns**, the particle 「の」 is required between the noun and 「まえに」. If the noun refers to an event or a point in time (e.g., 「会議」 'meeting', 「試験」 'exam'), 「まえに」 denotes temporal precedence, meaning \"before the meeting\" or \"before the exam.\" If the noun refers to a physical object or location (e.g., 「駅」 'station', 「家」 'house'), 「まえに」 denotes spatial position, meaning \"in front of the station\" or \"in front of the house.\" \n\nThis grammar point is fundamental for describing order in both time and space in Japanese.",
