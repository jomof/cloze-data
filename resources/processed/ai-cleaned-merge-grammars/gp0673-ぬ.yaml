    "writeup": "「ぬ」 is an archaic auxiliary verb that expresses negation, much like 「ない」 in modern Japanese. However, 「ぬ」 is primarily found in classical literature, historical contexts, or when attempting to create a deliberately old-fashioned or dramatic tone. It connects to the stem of a verb (the part before 「ます」). While not typically used in everyday conversation, understanding 「ぬ」 is crucial for interpreting older texts and appreciating certain stylistic choices in contemporary media.\n\n*   **Irregular Conjugations:** Be aware that certain verbs have irregular negative forms with 「ぬ」. For example:\n    *   「する」 becomes 「せぬ」\n    *   「くる」 becomes 「こぬ」\n    *   「いる」 often becomes 「おらぬ」",
