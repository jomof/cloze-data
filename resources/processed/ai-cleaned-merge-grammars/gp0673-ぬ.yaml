    "etymology": "「ぬ」 is the attributive form of 「ず」, a classical auxiliary verb indicating negation. It's an older form of 「ない」 and carries a formal or archaic nuance.",
    "writeup": "「ぬ」 is a classical auxiliary verb that functions as a negative, similar to 「ない」 in modern Japanese. It is the attributive form of 「ず」. It's primarily found in classical literature, historical dramas, and fixed expressions. While 「ない」 is the standard negative form in modern Japanese, 「ぬ」 is used to evoke a sense of antiquity or formality. The forms of specific verbs change in predictable ways.\n\n*   「いる」 becomes 「おらぬ」\n*   「する」 becomes 「せぬ」\n*   「くる」 becomes 「こぬ」\n\nWhile rarely used in modern conversation, knowing 「ぬ」 helps in understanding older texts and appreciating stylistic choices in certain media. Some set phrases still use 「ぬ」, like 「知らぬ間に」 (\"before you know it\").",
