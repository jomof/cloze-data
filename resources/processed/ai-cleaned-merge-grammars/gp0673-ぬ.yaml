    "etymology": "「ぬ」 is the attributive form of 「ず」, an archaic auxiliary verb signifying negation. It's the older counterpart to modern 「ない」.",
    "writeup": "ぬ」 is an archaic auxiliary verb that expresses negation, much like 「ない」 in modern Japanese. However, 「ぬ」 is primarily found in classical literature, historical contexts, or when attempting to create a deliberately old-fashioned or dramatic tone. It connects to the stem of a verb (the part before 「ます」). While not typically used in everyday conversation, understanding 「ぬ」 is crucial for interpreting older texts and appreciating certain stylistic choices in contemporary media.\n\n**Irregular Conjugations:** Be aware that certain verbs have irregular negative forms with 「ぬ」. For example:\n*   「する」 becomes 「せぬ」\n*   「くる」 becomes 「こぬ」\n*   「いる」 often becomes 「おらぬ",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ぬ」 shares its core meaning of negation with 「ない」 and 「ず」, its usage is distinct. 「ない」 is the standard modern negative. 「ず」 is the stem form of the same classical auxiliary as 「ぬ」, often appearing before other grammatical elements (e.g., 「～ずに」). In contrast, 「ぬ」 acts as the attributive form, directly preceding nouns, or as a strong, final negation, evoking a literary or archaic tone.",
