meaning: in addition
pronunciation:
  katakana: クワエテ
  romaji: kuwaete
formation:
  Noun に加えて: Used to introduce an additional noun or item, meaning "in addition to Noun."

  Sentence 加えて: Used as a conjunctive word to add further information or a new element to a previously
    stated sentence.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The term 加えて (kuwaete) is the te-form of the verb 加える (kuwaeru), which means "to add," "to
  sum up," or "to include." Historically, its use as a conjunctive expression evolved from its literal
  meaning of "adding on" to convey the sense of "in addition" or "furthermore." This grammaticalization
  allows it to function as a transition word that introduces supplementary information or another element
  to what has already been stated, whether it be a list, a reason, or an action.
writeup: 加えて (kuwaete) is a versatile conjunction used to introduce additional information that supplements
  or reinforces a previously stated idea, fact, or action. It can be translated as "in addition," "furthermore,"
  "moreover," or "on top of that." It is more formal than simply connecting clauses with と or そして, and
  implies a logical extension or accumulation of points. This grammar point is commonly used in both written
  and spoken Japanese, especially in contexts where clarity and a structured presentation of information
  are important, such as presentations, reports, or formal discussions. It allows the speaker or writer
  to build upon previous statements by adding new details, reasons, or examples.

  - term: そして
    meaning: and.and then
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: そして (soshite) is a general conjunctive particle that primarily indicates a sequential or simple
      additive relationship between clauses or sentences. It implies "and then" or "and," focusing on
      the flow of events or listing items without necessarily emphasizing the cumulative aspect. 加えて (kuwaete),
      on the other hand, specifically introduces additional information or an additive element that reinforces
      or expands upon what was previously mentioned, often with a slightly more formal tone.
    grammar_point: そして (and・and then)
  - term: また
    meaning: again.also.or
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: また (mata) can mean "also" or "again," indicating repetition or the inclusion of another item.
      While it adds information, it is generally less formal than 加えて (kuwaete) and can simply list items
      or actions without strongly emphasizing the idea of accumulation or building upon a previous point.
      加えて carries a stronger sense of "in addition to what was already stated."
    grammar_point: また (again; also; or)
  - term: おまけに
    meaning: in addition.on top of that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: おまけに (omake ni) means "in addition" or "to make matters worse/better," but it often carries
      a nuance of an extra, often unexpected, or even a slightly negative or positive, addition. It can
      imply a "bonus" or an "unfortunate consequence." 加えて (kuwaete) is more neutral and objective, simply
      stating the addition without the implied emotional coloring.
    grammar_point: おまけに (in addition・on top of that)
  - term: その上
    meaning: in addition.moreover
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: その上 (sono ue) is very similar to 加えて (kuwaete), meaning "in addition" or "moreover." However,
      その上 often suggests a logical progression or a surprising reinforcement of the previous statement,
      implying "on top of that, something else is true." 加えて can be a more general and direct way to simply
      state an additional point, without necessarily implying a strong logical connection or surprise.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:それに・加えて・その上・しかも (in addition・moreover)
  - term: それに
    meaning: in addition.moreover
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: それに (sore ni) is a relatively casual conjunction used to add another point or reason. It's
      often used when simply listing additional facts. While similar to 加えて (kuwaete), 加えて is generally
      more formal and emphasizes the cumulative effect of adding information, making it suitable for more
      structured or formal discourse. それに is more akin to simply saying "and also."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:それに・加えて・その上・しかも (in addition・moreover)
post_false_friends_writeup: The choice among these "in addition" expressions often depends on the formality,
  nuance, and the type of information being added. While そして, また, and それに are generally more casual and
  serve broader connective functions, 加えて and その上 lean towards more formal or structured contexts, emphasizing
  the accumulation or logical progression of points. おまけに uniquely carries an emotional connotation of
  an additional, often unexpected, factor. Understanding these subtle differences will allow you to select
  the most appropriate expression for your intended meaning and context.
