    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にあって」 combines the particle 「に」, indicating location or circumstance, and the te-form of the verb 「ある」, meaning 'to be'. Together, they express the idea of 'being in' or 'existing under' a specific condition.",
    "writeup": "「にあって」 is a formal Japanese grammar construction that functions as a sophisticated way to specify the context or conditions under which an event or situation takes place. It literally translates to \"being in/at\" or \"existing under\" a certain state. It is primarily used in formal writing and speech, and is not typically encountered in casual conversation.\n\nThis grammar point is formed by attaching 「にあって」 to a noun that defines the specific situation, condition, or period. The subsequent clause then typically describes something notable, often unexpected, that occurs within or despite these circumstances.\n\nWhen 「にあって」 is followed by 「も」 (i.e., 「にあっても」), it emphasizes that an action or state persists **even if** the given conditions are challenging or contrary to what might be expected. This highlights resilience or an unusual outcome.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「にあって」 sets the stage for what follows, providing the situational background.\n*   It often implies a contrast between the described situation and the event that unfolds, especially with the addition of 「も」.\n*   **Caution**: Do not confuse this 「にあって」 with the te-form of the verb 「遭う (あう)」 (to meet, to encounter, often used for negative experiences). For example, 「事故に遭って (じこ に あって)」 means \"to meet with an accident,\" where the あって is a conjugation of 「遭う」, not 「ある」. The 「にあって」 of this grammar point specifically uses the te-form of 「ある」.",
