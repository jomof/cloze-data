    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にみえる」 combines the particle 「に」, indicating direction or purpose, with the verb 「見える(みえる)」, meaning 'to be visible' or 'to appear'. This combination creates the nuance of something appearing *as* or *like* something else.",
    "writeup": "「にみえる」 combines the particle 「に」 with the verb 「見える(みえる)」. It's used to express that something looks or appears a certain way. Think of it as conveying the impression something gives off to the observer. It is typically written in hiragana. \n\nWhile it primarily connects to nouns, showing something 'appears to be (A)', it can also pair with auxiliary verbs like 「ようだ」 or 「そうだ」(in their adverbial forms 「ように」 and 「そうに」) to add a layer of uncertainty, making it sound like 'to seem to be (A)'. 「みたい」 can replace 「ようだ」, resulting in 「みたいにみえる」, reinforcing the speaker's guess that something *could be* (A).\n\n**Important Consideration: Kanji Usage**\nFor grammatical structures like this, kanji is very rarely used. Using kanji for 「見える」 when it is part of a set grammatical construction such as 「にみえる」 can subtly alter a native speaker's perception of the meaning. Many grammar structures are written purely in hiragana precisely to signify they are a fixed grammatical pattern. Employing kanji might lead the reader to interpret the meaning literally based on the kanji itself, rather than the intended grammatical function.",
