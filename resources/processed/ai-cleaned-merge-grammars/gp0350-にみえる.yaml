    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the particle 「に」, indicating direction or purpose, with the verb 「見える(みえる)」, meaning 'to be visible' or 'to appear'. Together, they form a construction that describes something appearing as or resembling something else.",
    "writeup": "「にみえる」 (primarily written only in hiragana) is a phrase that combines the case-marking particle 「に」 with the verb 「見える」, meaning 'to appear' or 'to be visible'. This construction is regularly used with nouns to show that something 'appears to be (A)', but it may also be partnered with the auxiliary verbs 「ようだ」 or 「そうだ」 (in their adverbial forms 「ように」 and 「そうに」) to add a level of uncertainty. In these cases, it sounds closer to 'to seem to be (A)' in English. As with many other 「ようだ」 structures, 「みたい」 may be used instead. This creates the expression 「みたいにみえる」. While this may appear confusing at first, it just means 'to look like something that could be (A)'. In this way it reinforces the 'guess' that the speaker is making.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   In grammar constructions like this, kanji will very rarely be used. This is primarily because it will change the way a native speaker perceives the meaning. Many grammar structures are written purely in hiragana, specifically to express that they are a 'set' construction. Adding kanji can lead a reader to assume that the writer is highlighting the kanji's meaning, rather than the more common grammatical meaning.",
