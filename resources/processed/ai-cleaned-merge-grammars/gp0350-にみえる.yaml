    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にみえる」 combines the particle 「に」, indicating direction or purpose, with the verb 「見える(みえる)」, meaning 'to be visible' or 'to appear'. This combination creates the nuance of something appearing *as* or *like* something else.",
    "writeup": "「にみえる」 combines the particle 「に」 with the verb 「見える(みえる)」. It's used to express that something looks or appears a certain way. Think of it as conveying the impression something gives off to the observer. It is typically written in hiragana. \n\nWhile it primarily connects to nouns, showing something 'appears to be (A)', it can also pair with auxiliary verbs like 「ようだ」 or 「そうだ」(in their adverbial forms 「ように」 and 「そうに」) to add a layer of uncertainty, making it sound like 'to seem to be (A)'. 「みたい」 can replace 「ようだ」, resulting in 「みたいにみえる」, reinforcing the speaker's guess that something *could be* (A).",
