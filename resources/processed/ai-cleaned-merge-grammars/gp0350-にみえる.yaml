        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "To describe an impression or appearance based on observation.",
        "nuance": "This expresses an appearance or impression, often based on visual observation, but can also be based on general perception. It differs from a direct statement of fact, implying a subjective observation by the speaker. The use of hiragana for 見える is crucial to distinguish it as a grammatical pattern rather than the literal verb 'to be visible'.",

        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a predicate, describing the state or appearance of the subject."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にみえる」 combines the particle 「に」, indicating direction or purpose, with the verb 「見える(みえる)」, meaning 'to be visible' or 'to appear'. This combination creates the nuance of something appearing *as* or *like* something else. Historically, 「見える」 itself developed from 「目得る」 (me eru), meaning 'to gain sight' or 'to enter the eye', evolving into its current stative sense of 'being visible'. When combined with 「に」, it emphasizes the resulting appearance or the way something is perceived.",
    "writeup": "「にみえる」 combines the particle 「に」 with the verb 「見える(みえる)」. It's used to express that something looks or appears a certain way. Think of it as conveying the impression something gives off to the observer. It is typically written in hiragana.\n\nWhile it primarily connects to nouns, showing something 'appears to be (A)', it can also pair with auxiliary verbs like 「ようだ」 or 「そうだ」(in their adverbial forms 「ように」 and 「そうに」) to add a layer of uncertainty, making it sound like 'to seem to be (A)'. 「みたい」 can replace 「ようだ」, resulting in 「みたいにみえる」, reinforcing the speaker's guess that something *could be* (A).\n\n**Important Consideration: Kanji Usage**\nFor grammatical structures like this, kanji is very rarely used. Using kanji for 「見える」 when it is part of a set grammatical construction such as 「にみえる」 can subtly alter a native speaker's perception of the meaning. Many grammar structures are written purely in hiragana precisely to signify they are a fixed grammatical pattern. Employing kanji might lead the reader to interpret the meaning literally based on the kanji itself, rather than the intended grammatical function.",
