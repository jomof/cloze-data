    "etymology": "「ずにはおかない」 is a sophisticated expression rooted in classical Japanese. It combines the classical negative auxiliary verb 「ず」 (z-u), the particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negated form of the verb 「措く」 (oku), meaning 'to set aside' or 'to leave as is'. Literally, it means 'cannot leave it as it is without doing (A)', thus conveying an unwavering determination or the inevitability of an action. The form 「ないではおかない」 is a modern equivalent where 「ず」 is replaced by 「ないで」, maintaining the same strong implication.",
    "writeup": "「ずにはおかない」 is a powerful grammatical construction that expresses a strong determination that something **will definitely happen** or that the speaker **will not fail to do something**. It carries a nuance of unwavering resolve, implying that the speaker will not give up until the action is completed. This expression is quite formal and is typically encountered in written language, speeches, or very serious conversations.\n\nWhile its literal interpretation is 'cannot leave it undone', its practical meaning signifies an absolute certainty or firm commitment. It emphasizes the inevitability of an action or outcome. For instance, if a person says 「敵を倒さずにはおかない」, it conveys a firm resolve to defeat the enemy, a promise that the action will certainly be carried out.\n\nA key aspect of 「ずにはおかない」 is its use with verbs, particularly causative verbs. When used with causative verbs (e.g., 「〜させる」), it indicates that the speaker is determined to *make* someone else do something. This highlights the strong will of the speaker to influence or control an outcome involving others. For example, 「彼に謝らせずにはおかない」 means 'I will not fail to make him apologize', indicating a strong determination to force an apology.\n\nAn equally common and interchangeable variation is 「ないではおかない」. Although it uses the more modern 「ないで」 form, the meaning and strength of expression remain identical. Both forms convey the same degree of certainty and determination.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While adverbs like 「必ず」、「間違いなく」、and 「絶対に」 convey certainty, 「ずにはおかない」 adds a layer of strong determination or inherent inevitability that these adverbs alone do not. For example, 「必ず来る」 means 'will certainly come', but it doesn't carry the same weight as 「来させずにはおかない」, which implies a strong personal resolve to make someone come. The distinction between 「ずにはおかない」 and 「ずにはいられない」/「ずにはおれない」 is crucial. The former implies a willful action or an inevitable outcome, whereas the latter describes an irresistible internal impulse or feeling. Remember, 「おかない」 means 'not leave undone', emphasizing action or outcome, while 「いられない」/「おれない」 means 'cannot remain', emphasizing an internal state or feeling.",
