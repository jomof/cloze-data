        "[Noun] + かたがた": "Indicates doing something for one purpose while also accomplishing another, often of equal or lesser importance."

    "etymology": "「かたがた」 is derived from 「方々(かたがた)」, which means \"various people\" or \"various places.\" The grammar point evolved to express the idea of visiting various people or places for multiple purposes simultaneously. It carries a sense of performing one action while also incidentally or intentionally accomplishing another.",
    "writeup": "「かたがた」 is a conjunction primarily written in hiragana. It translates to \"in addition to (A), (B),\" \"along with (A), (B),\" or \"incidentally to (A), (B).\" While both (A) and (B) may have equal priority, (B) carries the nuance of \"while doing (A), also doing (B) in passing.\" 「かたがた」 attaches to a noun marking (A), while (B) often involves a verb of action, though not always. When (A) is a noun typically used with 「する」, the 「する」 is omitted.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「かたがた」 is a formal structure, common in writing and used in apologies or expressions of gratitude. It may sound unnatural if the linked actions lack a specific purpose.",

            "japanese": "婚約の報告 {かたがた}、お父様と お母様に 会いに行きます。",
            "english": "I will go see my partner’s parents, partly to let them know about our engagement.",

                    "mitigation": "While grammatically correct, this phrasing emphasizes a single purpose. The scene highlights that the visit has a dual purpose: formal announcement and building family relations, which 「かたがた」 conveys with subtlety."

            "speaker_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "While this phrase can be used by anyone, when a woman uses 「お父様」 and 「お母様」 in this context, it often carries a specific nuance of deeply respecting and integrating into her partner's family, fitting the formal register of 「かたがた」. This usage emphasizes her commitment and responsibility to the new family.",
            "etymology": "「婚約」 means engagement. 「報告」 means report. 「お父様」 and 「お母様」 are respectful ways to address one's father and mother (or in-laws)."

When addressing a male superior, the formality of 「かたがた」 is highly appropriate, emphasizing respectful communication. It is used when speaking to someone of a higher status, such as a boss or client.",
