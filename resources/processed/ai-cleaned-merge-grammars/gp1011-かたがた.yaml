    "etymology": "「かたがた」 is derived from 「方々(かたがた)」, which means \"various people\" or \"various places.\" The grammar point evolved to express the idea of visiting various people or places for multiple purposes simultaneously. It carries a sense of performing one action while also incidentally or intentionally accomplishing another.",
    "writeup": "「かたがた」is a conjunction primarily written in hiragana. It translates to \"in addition to (A), (B),\" \"along with (A), (B),\" or \"incidentally to (A), (B).\" While both (A) and (B) may have equal priority, (B) carries the nuance of \"while doing (A), also doing (B) in passing.\" 「かたがた」 attaches to a noun marking (A), while (B) often involves a verb of action, though not always.  When (A) is a noun typically used with 「する」, the 「する」 is omitted. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「かたがた」 is a formal structure, common in writing and used in apologies or expressions of gratitude. It may sound unnatural if the linked actions lack a specific purpose.",
