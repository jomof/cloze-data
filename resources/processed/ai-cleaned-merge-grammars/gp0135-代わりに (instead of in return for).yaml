    "etymology": "The phrase 「代わりに」 comes from the noun 「代わり」 (kawari), which means \"substitute\" or \"replacement,\" combined with the particle 「に」 (ni), indicating a purpose or function. Thus, 「代わりに」 literally means \"in the role of a substitute.\" Over time, its usage expanded to encompass notions of compensation and trade-offs beyond simple direct replacement.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「代わりに・かわりに」 (kawari ni) is used to express ideas of substitution, replacement, or compensation. It connects two clauses or phrases, indicating that one element or action occurs in the place of another, or that one aspect serves to balance or make up for another.\n\nThere are primarily two ways 「代わりに」 is used:\n\n1.  **Substitution/Replacement (Nounの代わりに):** When attached to a noun with 「の」, 「代わりに」 means \"instead of [Noun]\" or \"in place of [Noun].\" It indicates a direct substitution, where the original noun is replaced by something or someone else.\n\n2.  **Compensation/Trade-off (Verb/Adjective plain form + 代わりに):** When attached to a plain form verb or adjective (including Adjective い and Adjective な), 「代わりに」 indicates a compensatory relationship or a trade-off. This usage implies that while one thing is true or one action is taken, another action or state occurs to balance it out, often suggesting that one aspect is done \"in return for\" or \"to make up for\" another. It can also be used to show a contrasting aspect that compensates for the preceding characteristic.",

In contrast, 「けれど(も)」 and 「しかし」 merely express a simple contrast or concession without the 'in return' nuance. 「〜じゃなくて」 is a direct negation followed by an alternative, lacking the compensatory or substitutional depth of 「代わりに」. Therefore, if the meaning involves a trade-off, compensation, or a direct replacement where the original item or action is specifically substituted, 「代わりに」 is the appropriate choice.",
