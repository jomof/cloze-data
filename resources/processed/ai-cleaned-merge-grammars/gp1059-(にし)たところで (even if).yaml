id: gp1059
meaning: Even if; even when (implying futility or lack of effect)
pronunciation:
  katakana: タトコロデ
  romaji: tokorode
formation:
  Verb[た form] + ところで: Indicates that even if the action is performed, the expected outcome will not be
    achieved, or the action will be futile.
jlpt: N1
etymology: The expression `〜たところで` is formed from the past tense of a verb (〜た) followed by the noun `ところ`
  (place, situation, point in time) and the particle `で` (at, in, by means of). Literally, it means something
  like "even at the point where [action] was done." This construction highlights a specific juncture or
  state (ところ) and then uses `で` to introduce a condition or context. The nuance of futility arises from
  the context where, despite reaching that 'point' or 'situation' (ところ), the anticipated positive outcome
  does not materialize, implying that the effort was in vain. It evolved from describing a specific state
  of affairs to expressing a general conditional where the action performed is deemed insufficient or
  ineffective.
writeup: "The grammatical pattern `〜たところで` is used to express that 'even if' a certain action is taken\
  \ or a certain situation occurs, the result will be negligible, futile, or contrary to what might be\
  \ expected. It strongly conveys the speaker's resignation, disappointment, or skepticism regarding the\
  \ effectiveness of the action or the possibility of a different outcome. \n\nThis expression is typically\
  \ used when the speaker believes that a particular effort or action will not lead to a desired result.\
  \ It's often found in sentences where the consequence is negative or indicates a lack of change. It's\
  \ a more emphatic and often pessimistic version of other 'even if' conditionals like `〜ても` or `〜としても`.\n\
  \nWhile `〜ても` can express a simple 'even if' without a strong negative connotation (e.g., 「雨が降っても行きます」\
  \ - \"Even if it rains, I'll go.\"), `〜たところで` explicitly implies that the action is not worth doing\
  \ because it won't make a difference. For example, 「今から走ったところで、間に合わないだろう」 (\"Even if I run now, I probably\
  \ won't make it in time.\") clearly states the futility of running.\n\nIt can be used with various types\
  \ of verbs, always in their past plain (`た`) form."
false_friends:
  - term: 〜ても
    meaning: Even if; even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both `〜たところで` and `〜ても` mean 'even if', `〜たところで` carries a strong nuance of futility
      or resignation, implying that the action is pointless. `〜ても` is a more general conditional and does
      not necessarily imply futility; it can simply state a fact or possibility.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: 〜としても
    meaning: Even if; supposing that; granted that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`〜としても` is used to present a hypothetical situation and then comment on it, often with a
      more neutral or objective tone. `〜たところで` is more subjective and explicitly conveys the speaker''s
      belief that the hypothetical action will be ineffective or useless.'
    grammar_point: としても (even if assumed)
  - term: 〜たからといって
    meaning: Just because; even if it's true that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`〜たからといって` means ''just because X, doesn''t mean Y'', often used to deny a logical consequence.
      `〜たところで` means ''even if X, it won''t lead to Y'', focusing on the futility of X itself, not disputing
      the logical connection.'
    grammar_point: からと言って・だからと言って (just because・even so)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between these expressions, consider the degree of futility or
  resignation you wish to convey. If you simply want to state a general conditional or a concession without
  a strong negative implication, `〜ても` or `〜としても` are better choices. If you want to emphasize that an
  action is pointless or will not lead to the desired outcome, `〜たところで` is the appropriate option.
examples:
  - english: Even if you complain now, it's too late.
    japanese:
      - 今更 文句 を {言っ た ところ で}、もう 遅い。
      - 今更 文句 を {言っ た ところ で}、もう 遅い です。
    english_literally: Even if complain now, already late.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今更 文句 を 言っ て も、もう 遅い。
        english: Even if you complain now, it's already too late.
        hint: The nuance of `〜ても` is a general 'even if', without strongly implying futility or resignation.
          We're looking for an expression that suggests complaining now is utterly pointless.
    scene: A student missed a deadline and is trying to argue with the teacher.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
  - english: Even if you study this much, it won't make a difference to the results.
    japanese:
      - これ だけ 勉強 {し た ところ で}、結果 は 変わら ない だろう。
      - これ だけ 勉強 {し た ところ で}、結果 は 変わら ない でしょう。
    english_literally: Even if this much study do, results will not change probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ だけ 勉強 し た と し て も、結果 は 変わら ない だろう。
        english: Even if you study this much, supposing that, the results probably won't change.
        hint: While `〜としても` expresses a hypothetical, it lacks the strong implication of inherent futility
          that `〜たところで` conveys. We need to emphasize the pointlessness of the action.
    scene: A disheartened student is studying for a very difficult exam.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: pessimistic
    nuance: The speaker is expressing a sense of resignation that, despite the effort of studying (「勉強した」),
      the outcome is predetermined and unfavorable. The use of 「だろう」 reinforces the speaker's low expectation
      for a positive change.
  - english: Even if I apologize now, it won't resolve anything.
    japanese:
      - 今 謝っ た ところ で、何 も 解決 し ない だろう。
      - 今 謝っ た ところ で、何 も 解決 し ない でしょう。
    english_literally: Now apologize, nothing will solve probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今 謝っ て も、何 も 解決 し ない だろう。
        english: Even if I apologize now, nothing will be resolved.
        hint: This form (〜ても) simply states a conditional. We want to convey that apologizing is a futile
          act in this specific situation, emphasizing its pointlessness.
    scene: A person reflects on a past mistake that caused irreparable damage.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of `〜たところで` here, coupled with the casual male speech ending `だろう`, signifies a personal,
      somewhat melancholic realization that the act of apologizing (「謝った」) would be utterly ineffective
      and not lead to any resolution. The speaker's internal monologue expresses a deep sense of futility.
      Male speakers often use plain forms like `だろう` in casual self-reflection.
  - english: Even if you tell the truth now, nobody will believe it.
    japanese:
      - 今 更 真実 を {言っ た ところ で}、誰 も 信じ ない だろう。
      - 今 更 真実 を {言っ た ところ で}、誰 も 信じ ない でしょう。
    english_literally: Now truth tell, nobody will believe probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今 更 真実 を 言っ たって、誰 も 信じ ない だろう。
        english: Even if you say the truth now, nobody will believe it.
        hint: The casual `〜たって` is similar to `〜ても` but still doesn't carry the strong sense of futility
          that `〜たところで` does. We need to imply the absolute pointlessness of telling the truth at this
          stage.
    scene: Someone has lied for a long time and is considering confessing.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
  - english: Even if you gather all your strength, you won't be able to lift this rock.
    japanese:
      - 全力 を {出し た ところ で}、この 岩 は 持ち上がら ない だろう。
      - 全力 を {出し た ところ で}、この 岩 は 持ち上がら ない でしょう。
    english_literally: All strength put out, this rock will not lift probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 全力 を 出し たって、この 岩 は 持ち上がら ない だろう。
        english: Even if you give your all, this rock won't lift.
        hint: The casual `〜たって` is too general. We need to express that even max effort (「全力」) will be
          insufficient and futile in lifting the rock.
    scene: Two friends are trying to move a massive rock.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
  - english: Even if you try to explain it now, it's already useless.
    japanese:
      - 今 から 説明 {し た ところ で}、もう 無駄 だ。
      - 今 から 説明 {し た ところ で}、もう 無駄 です。
    english_literally: From now explanation do, already useless.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今 から 説明 し た ところ で、もう 意味 が ない。
        english: Even if you explain it now, it's meaningless.
        hint: The original phrasing uses `無駄だ` (useless), which `意味がない` (meaningless) is very close to.
          However, we want to ensure the specific nuance of 'futile' is captured rather than just 'meaningless'.
    scene: A project has already been canceled due to a misunderstanding.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
  - english: Even if you chase after it, you won't catch up.
    japanese:
      - 追いかけ た ところ で、追いつか ない よ。
      - 追いかけ た ところ で、追いつき ませ ん よ。
    english_literally: Even if chase, won't catch up.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 追いかけ て も、追いつか ない よ。
        english: Even if you chase, you won't catch up.
        hint: '`〜ても` is a weaker conditional. We''re looking for a phrase that specifically conveys the
          futility of getting angry, implying it''s a useless reaction.'
    scene: Someone is lamenting missing a bus or train.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The feminine sentence-ending particle 「よ」 adds a gentle, somewhat resigned tone to the statement
      of futility. While `〜たところで` itself conveys the futility of chasing (「追いかけた」), the 「よ」 softens the
      delivery, making it sound more like an empathetic observation rather than a harsh judgment. Female
      speakers often use `よ` to add emphasis or a sense of knowing to their statements in casual conversation.
  - english: Even if you put it off until tomorrow, the work won't decrease.
    japanese:
      - 明日 に {し た ところ で}、仕事 は 減ら ない よ。
      - 明日 に {し た ところ で}、仕事 は 減り ませ ん よ。
    english_literally: Even if put off until tomorrow, work won't decrease.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 に し て も、仕事 は 減ら ない よ。
        english: Even if it's tomorrow, the work won't decrease.
        hint: '`〜にしても` here means ''even if it''s X'', referring to a time. While similar, it doesn''t
          carry the strong futility of ''even if you *do* something until tomorrow''. We need to express
          that delaying the action is pointless.'
    scene: A busy person considers procrastinating.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
  - english: Even if you try to make excuses, it's no use.
    japanese:
      - どんな に 言い訳 を {し た ところ で}、無駄 だろう。
      - どんな に 言い訳 を {し た ところ で}、無駄 でしょう。
    english_literally: No matter how much excuses make, useless probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - どんな に 言い訳 を し て も、無駄 だろう。
        english: No matter how many excuses you make, it will be useless.
        hint: This competing option (`〜ても`) means 'even if' or 'no matter how much'. While grammatically
          correct, it doesn't convey the same strong sense of complete futility and resignation as `〜たところで`
          when discussing the act of making excuses.
    scene: A boss talks to an employee who is trying to justify poor performance.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The combination of `どんなに...したところで` emphasizes that regardless of the extent of excuses made
      (「言い訳をした」), the effort is pointless. An older speaker in a formal setting might use this to convey
      authority and finality, implying that further attempts at justification are futile and will not
      change the outcome. The `だろう` softens the directness slightly but maintains the firm stance.
  - english: Even if you retry, the result will probably be the same.
    japanese:
      - もう 一 度 やり直し た ところ で、結果 は 同じ だろう。
      - もう 一 度 やり直し た ところ で、結果 は 同じ でしょう。
    english_literally: One more time retry, result same probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 一 度 やり直し たって、結果 は 同じ だろう。
        english: Even if you retry, the result will be the same.
        hint: This casual `〜たって` does not carry the same strong nuance of inescapable futility as `〜たところで`.
          We want to emphasize that retrying is definitively pointless.
    scene: A team failed a task and is debating whether to attempt it again.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
  - english: Even if I get angry, nothing will change.
    japanese:
      - 怒っ た ところ で、何 も 変わら ない。
      - 怒っ た ところ で、何 も 変わり ませ ん。
    english_literally: Even if get angry, nothing changes.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 怒っ て も、何 も 変わら ない。
        english: Even if I get angry, nothing will change.
        hint: '`〜ても` is a general conditional. We''re looking for a phrase that specifically conveys the
          futility of getting angry, implying it''s a useless reaction.'
    scene: A person feeling frustrated but resigned.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
post_example_writeup: As illustrated by the examples, `〜たところで` is a versatile expression to convey futility
  across various contexts, from daily frustrations to more serious reflections. It's particularly effective
  when you want to strongly emphasize that an action will not yield the desired effect, serving as a powerful
  tool to express resignation or skepticism.
