  particle-syntactic-function: temporal
  usage-context: Indicates the specific time when an action or event takes place. It is used with specific
    times, dates, days of the week, and certain events. However, it cannot be used with relative time
    expressions such as 今朝 (this morning), 明日 (tomorrow), 昨日 (yesterday), 今日 (today), 最近 (recently), 今週
    (this week), 来月 (next month), or other terms that do not pinpoint a unique time.
  function: To specify the precise temporal point or period at which an action or event occurs.
  nuance: The particle 「に」 provides a clear and unambiguous marker for time, highlighting the exact moment
    or period of an action. Its usage emphasizes specificity.
etymology: The particle 「に」 has ancient roots in Japanese, evolving from earlier forms used to denote
  location and direction. Over time, its function expanded to include marking specific points in time.
  It's a fundamental particle and its origins are intertwined with the core development of the Japanese
  language.
writeup: "The particle 「に」 is used to precisely indicate when an action or event takes place. It acts\
  \ as a temporal marker, answering the question \"When?\" It is essential for specifying exact times,\
  \ dates, days of the week, and fixed events. \n\n**Key Usage Rules:**\n*   **Use 「に」 with specific times:**\
  \ For instance, 「７時に」 (at 7 o'clock), 「９時半に」 (at 9:30).\n*   **Use 「に」 with specific dates:** Like 「４月１日に」\
  \ (on April 1st), 「５月５日に」 (on May 5th).\n*   **Use 「に」 with specific days of the week:** Such as 「月曜日に」\
  \ (on Monday), 「金曜日に」 (on Friday).\n*   **Use 「に」 with fixed events or holidays:** For example, 「クリスマスに」\
  \ (on Christmas), 「誕生日パーティーに」 (at the birthday party).\n\n**Important Exclusions:**\nHowever, 「に」 cannot\
  \ be used with time expressions that are not specific, such as 「今日」 (today), 「明日」 (tomorrow), 「昨日」 (yesterday),\
  \ 「来週」 (next week), 「今月」 (this month), 「最近」 (recently), or 「いつも」 (always). If a time expression can\
  \ be uniquely identified by a number or a fixed calendar point, 「に」 can be used. If it's a relative\
  \ or general time expression, 「に」 is typically omitted."

  - term: で (de)
    meaning: at, in, on (location)
    kind: often confused with

    meaning: to, towards (direction)

    grammar_point: <suggest>:に (location, direction)
  - term: 「に」の省略
    meaning: Omission of the time particle に
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: For certain specific time expressions (e.g., days of the week, defined seasons like 夏休み, or
      after 時), the particle 「に」 can be optionally omitted. While acceptable, including 「に」 often adds
      a nuance of greater precision or emphasis on that specific temporal point.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:に (optional time marker)
post_false_friends_writeup: The particle 「に」 can sometimes be confused with 「で」 or directional uses of
  「に」. The key is to remember that when referring to time, 「に」 pinpoints *when* something occurs. 「で」
  identifies the *location* of an action, while directional 「に」 indicates movement *towards* a place.
  Additionally, be aware that 「に」 can sometimes be omitted without changing the core meaning, but its
  inclusion often adds a nuance of precision to the temporal reference.
