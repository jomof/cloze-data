    "etymology": "「に限る」is derived from the particle 「に」 (indicating location or scope) and the verb 「限る(かぎる)」 (to limit). The combination expresses the idea of something being limited to or being the best within a certain scope or context. Literally, it means \"to set a boundary on\", implying the best thing is within that boundary or is restricted to that boundary.",
    "writeup": "「に限る」 combines the particle 「に」, indicating location or scope, and the verb 「限る」, meaning \"to limit\". It expresses the idea that something is the best, most suitable, or limited to a specific condition. It can be translated as \"nothing beats,\" \"there's nothing like,\" or \"limited to.\"\n\n*   When used with a noun, it indicates a preference or that something is limited to that noun.\n*   When used with a verb in dictionary form, it suggests that doing that action is the best option.\n*   When used with a verb in negative form (ない), it expresses that *not* doing something is the best option.",
