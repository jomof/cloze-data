    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に限る」 is derived from 「に」 (a case marking particle indicating location or scope) and 「限る」 (kagiru), which means \"to limit.\" Therefore, 「に限る」 literally means \"to be limited to\" or \"to set a boundary on,\" implying that something is the best within that specified scope or the only thing applicable.",
    "writeup": "「に限る」 combines the particle 「に」 (marking a location or scope) with the verb 「限る」 (kagiru, meaning \"to limit\"). This grammar point expresses that there is \"nothing better than\" something, or that something is \"limited to\" a specific case. It's used to express a strong preference or that something is the best choice in a given situation. 「に限る」 can follow nouns or verbs in their dictionary form. When used with a negative verb form (ない), it indicates that \"there is nothing better than not doing\" something.",
