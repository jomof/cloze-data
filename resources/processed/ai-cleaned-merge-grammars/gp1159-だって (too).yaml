        "part-of-speech": "particle",
        "register": "casual",
        "function": "Expresses that something applies in addition to what was previously stated or emphasizes that something is true even in a certain circumstance. Can also indicate 'any' or 'no matter' when used with question words. Can also function as a casual equivalent of ～ても (even if/though).",
        "nuance": "Often conveys a sense of slight impatience, surprise, or an insistent tone. It adds a stronger emphasis than も or でも in many cases.",
        "counterpoint": "も, でも"
    },
    "etymology": "Originally a conjunctive particle meaning \"because,\" the usage as 'too' or 'even' likely evolved from the nuance of providing a reason or justification. The question-word usage extends this to mean 'for any reason' or 'in any case'. Its use as a casual form of ～ても suggests a contraction or phonetic shift from that conditional particle.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「だって」 is a versatile expression primarily conveying the meaning of \"too,\" \"also,\" or \"even.\" It is frequently encountered in informal, conversational Japanese, adding emphasis or indicating that something applies in addition to what has been previously stated or implied. It often highlights an unexpected inclusion or assertion. For example, 「私だって」 means \"even I\" or \"I too,\" suggesting a nuance of surprise or insistence.\n\nWhen 「だって」 is paired with question words such as 誰 (who), 何 (what), いつ (when), or どこ (where), it takes on the meaning of \"any\" or \"no matter what/who/when/where.\" For instance, 「誰だって」 translates to \"anyone\" or \"no matter who,\" implying universality without exception.\n\nFurthermore, 「だって」 can function as a more casual, colloquial alternative to the conditional particle 「～ても」 (even if/though) when attached to the plain past form of verbs or adjectives. This usage adds a sense of resignation, emphasis, or an acknowledgment of a condition despite its implications.\n\nIt is important to note that while 「だって」 can often be interchangeable with 「も」 or 「でも」 in certain contexts, 「だって」 typically carries a stronger, more direct, and sometimes more emphatic tone, making it particularly effective in expressing surprise, slight impatience, or a firm assertion.",
