        "Register": "Typically used in conversation.",
        "Usage": "Expresses that something applies in addition to what was previously stated or emphasizes that something is true even in a certain circumstance. Can also indicate 'any' or 'no matter' when used with question words.",
        "Related Expressions": "も, でも"

    "etymology": "Originally a conjunctive particle meaning \"because,\" the usage as 'too' or 'even' likely evolved from the nuance of providing a reason or justification. The question-word usage extends this to mean 'for any reason' or 'in any case'.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「だって」 primarily conveys the meaning of \"too,\" \"also,\" or \"even.\" It is often used in casual conversation to add emphasis or to indicate something is true in addition to something else. When used with question words (誰, 何, いつ, どこ, etc.), it takes on the meaning of \"any\" or \"no matter what/who/when/where.\" For example, 「誰だって」 means \"anyone\" or \"no matter who.\"",
