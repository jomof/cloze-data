    "etymology": "The 「とする」 in this grammar point doesn't have a direct, literal etymology in the same way as some other grammar structures. Instead, it functions more as a verb that links a sensory description (often onomatopoeic or mimetic) to the experience of feeling or sensing it. The 「と」 particle here indicates the content of the feeling or sensation, while 「する」 is the verb \"to do,\" which in this case means \"to feel\" or \"to experience.\"",
    "writeup": "「とする」 is used to describe sensory or psychological experiences, often in response to something. It frequently accompanies onomatopoeic or mimetic words (sound symbolism) to express how something feels or appears. Several expressions use this pattern. For example, 「むっとする」 (to feel offended), 「ほっとする」 (to feel relieved), and 「かっとする」 (to flare up) are commonly used. These expressions capture immediate and often strong emotional or physical reactions.",
