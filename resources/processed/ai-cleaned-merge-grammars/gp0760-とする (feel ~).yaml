    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とする」 is derived from the verb 「する」 (to do). In this context, it functions as an auxiliary to express the feeling or impression that something *does* have a particular quality. It attaches to mimetic words (onomatopoeia and gitaigo) to convey a subjective sensation, emphasizing the manner or state described by the mimetic word.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「とする」 is primarily used with mimetic words (擬態語 - gitaigo, and 擬音語 - giongo, collectively often referred to as onomatopoeia in English) to describe a specific feeling, impression, or appearance. It transforms these descriptive words into a verbal expression, focusing on the subjective experience or vivid manner of something. This construction is highly versatile and frequently encountered in daily Japanese.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n*   **Subjective Impression:** 「とする」 conveys how something *feels* or *appears* to the speaker or observer. It's less about an objective fact and more about a sensory or psychological impression.\n*   **Mimetic Word Dependence:** Its meaning is entirely dependent on the mimetic word it follows. For example, 「ほっとする」 means \"to feel relieved\" (from the sound of a sigh), 「からっとする」 means \"to feel dry/clear\" (from the sensation of dryness).\n*   **State or Manner:** It describes either a momentary occurrence or a continuous state, or the manner in which an action or state occurs. For instance, 「ぼうっとしている」 describes being in a dazed state.\n\nWhile 「とする」 can be conjugated like a regular verb, its primary function remains tied to expressing these nuanced sensory or psychological impressions.",
