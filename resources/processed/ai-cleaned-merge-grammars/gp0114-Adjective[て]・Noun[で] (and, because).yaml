    "writeup": "This grammar point, **Adjective[て]・Noun[で]**, is used to connect adjectives and nouns, similar to \"and\" or \"because\" in English. It allows you to list multiple qualities or states.  \n\nFor い-adjectives, change the final い to くて. For example, *atarashii* (新しい - new) becomes *atarashikute* (新しくて).\n\nFor nouns and な-adjectives, simply add で to the base form. For example, *byouki* (病気 - illness) becomes *byoukide* (病気で).\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   This て/で form can also indicate a reason or cause, similar to \"because of\" or \"due to\".\n*   Be aware that いい becomes よくて, not いくて.",
