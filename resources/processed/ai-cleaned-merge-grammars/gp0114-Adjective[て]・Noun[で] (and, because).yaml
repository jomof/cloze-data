        "usage-context": "Used to connect adjectives or nouns to express multiple qualities, states, or to indicate a reason/cause. The 'standard' register typically means it is appropriate for a broad range of everyday situations without being overly casual or overly formal. It can be used in both written and spoken Japanese.",
        "function": "Conjunctive, indicating addition or causation",
        "nuance": "The て/で form of adjectives and nouns integrates the connected elements into a single coherent thought, implying a closer relationship than simply listing separate clauses.",
        "colocation": "Often followed by descriptive phrases or clauses that continue the description or consequence. Common with various い-adjectives (e.g., 大きい, 小さい, 難しい, 易しい) and な-adjectives/nouns (e.g., 静か, 綺麗, 病気, 晴れ).",

        "temporal-flow": "Does not typically indicate temporal sequence, unlike the て-form of verbs. Instead, it describes co-existing qualities or states. In the case of cause, the cause and effect are often simultaneous or the cause is a state that exists prior to or during the effect.",
        "spatial-flow": "Not directly related to spatial flow, but can describe multiple attributes of a single object or location simultaneously. For example, describing a room as 'big and bright' (広くて明るい) implies both qualities coexist in the same space."

    "etymology": "The 「て」 form originally evolved from the classical Japanese conjunctive particle 「して」, which itself derived from the verb 「す」 (to do). 「で」 is the conjunctive form of the copula 「だ」.",

It allows you to list multiple qualities or states.\n\nFor い-adjectives, change the final い to 「くて」. For example, *atarashii* (新しい - new) becomes *atarashikute* (新しくて).\n\nFor nouns and な-adjectives, simply add 「で」 to the base form. For example, *byouki* (病気 - illness) becomes *byoukide* (病気で).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This て/で form can also indicate a reason or cause, similar to \"because of\" or \"due to\".\n*   Be aware that いい becomes 「よくて」, not 「いくて」.",

The 「て」 form of verbs, such as 「食べて」 (tabete), implies a sequential action or a manner, like 'eating and then...' or 'by eating...'. For instance, 「ご飯を食べて、出かける」 (gohan o tabete, dekakeru) means 'I will eat and then go out'. This differs from 「い-adjective + くて」 which links attributes, or 「な-adjective / noun + で」 which connects attributes or states a reason. Furthermore, the negative conjugation 「なくて」, as in 「面白くなくて」 (omoshirokunakute - 'not interesting and/because'), expresses negation and connection simultaneously. It indicates that something is 'not X, and as a result...' or 'because it's not X...'.\n\nUnlike 「そして」, which simply links independent clauses or sentences additively, the 「て/で」 form integrates the elements into a single cohesive thought. Similarly, while 「から」 and 「ので」 explicitly state a cause or reason, the 「で」 form for nouns and な-adjectives implies the reason as part of the state or characteristic itself, often feeling less emphatic than 「から」 or 「ので」.",
