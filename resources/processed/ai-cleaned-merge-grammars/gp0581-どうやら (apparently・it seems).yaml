meaning: Apparently, it seems, it looks like
pronunciation:
  katakana: ドウヤラ
  romaji: douyara
formation:
  どうやら + [statement]: Indicates a degree of uncertainty, implying "apparently" or "it seems".
jlpt: N2
details:
  usage-context: general use
  function: expresses a strong inference or deduction, often based on circumstantial evidence or observation,
    conveying "it seems that" or "apparently".
  nuance: implies that the speaker has observed something or gathered information from which they are
    drawing a conclusion, rather than simply hearing it or directly observing an action.
  grammatical-role: adverb
etymology: 「どうやら」 originally comes from 「どう」 (how) + 「やら」, an archaic particle indicating uncertainty
  about a singular thing or a list. It's similar to adding "or whatever" or "or some such" in English
  to soften a statement, but for a whole statement. It implies the speaker is trying to figure out 'how'
  things are, and 'apparently' this is the conclusion.
writeup: 「どうやら」 translates to "apparently," "it seems like," or "it looks like." It is an adverb that
  expresses speculation and often appears at the beginning of a sentence, modifying the entire phrase.
  It strengthens the uncertainty of things the speaker is already unsure about, functioning similarly
  to saying "in some way it seems like (A)." It is frequently used in conjunction with other speculative
  expressions like 「ようだ」, 「そうだ」, and 「らしい」, adding a layer of personal inference or deduction to the statement.
  While 「どうやら」 can be used in both casual and polite contexts, its primary function is to indicate that
  the speaker is drawing a conclusion based on available, often circumstantial, evidence.
false_friends:
  - term: ようだ (it seems)
    meaning: It seems, looks like (based on direct observation or strong impression)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express conjecture, 「～ようだ」 is often based on direct observation or a more immediate
      impression, whereas {どうやら} suggests a conclusion reached after considering various circumstances
      or indirect evidence.
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
  - term: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems・I hear)'
    meaning: It seems, apparently (based on hearsay or strong likelihood/characteristic)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～らしい」 often indicates that information was received from others or describes something true
      to its nature. {どうやら} emphasizes the speaker's own inference or deduction from the situation, rather
      than information simply heard or a general characteristic.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
  - term: '[Adj-stem]・[V-stem]そうだ (looks・seems like)'
    meaning: Looks like, seems (based on visual appearance)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This form of 「～そうだ」 is strictly based on immediate visual cues. {どうやら} is not limited to visual
      information; it can be based on any kind of circumstantial evidence or reasoning.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem・Adj-stem]〜そうだ (it seems・looks like)'
  - term: そうだ (hear that)
    meaning: I hear that; I'm told that (hearsay)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This form of 「～そうだ」 conveys information received directly from others. {どうやら} implies the
      speaker has processed various pieces of information or observations to arrive at a conclusion, rather
      than simply reporting what they heard.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]〜そうだ (i heard・it is said)'
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between {どうやら} and similar expressions like 「～ようだ」, 「～らしい」,
  and 「～そうだ」, consider the source of the conjecture. {どうやら} is best used when the speaker is drawing a
  conclusion through their own process of deduction, piecing together various bits of information or observations.
  It implies a sense of 'from what I can tell' or 'it appears to be the case.' In contrast, 「～ようだ」 is
  more about direct sensory impressions, 「～らしい」 is often about hearsay or typical characteristics, and
  「～そうだ」 (looks like) is visual, while 「～そうだ」 (I hear that) is about direct reports. {どうやら} adds a nuance
  of the speaker's intellectual involvement in arriving at the conclusion.
examples:
  - english: It seems like she doesn't need me.
    japanese:
      - '{どう やら} 私 に は 彼女 が 必要 が ない よう だ。'
      - '{どう やら} 俺 に は 彼女 が 必要 ない みたい だ。'
      - '{どう やら} 私 に は 彼女 が 必要 と し て い ない みたい。'
    english_literally: Apparently, I am not necessary for her.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 彼女 に は 必要 が ない {らしい}。
        english: Apparently, I'm not needed by her (based on hearsay).
        hint: 「らしい」 implies information from others or a strong likelihood, whereas {どうやら} is your own
          inference. We're looking for a deduction based on your own observation. There is no information
          in this sentence that implies the information came from others. Rather, it implies an internal
          deduction from observations. So, this sentence would be translated using {どうやら} to emphasize
          that deduction.
    scene: A man is reflecting on a recent breakup and feeling unneeded.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: melancholic
  - english: It seems he's apparently married.
    japanese:
      - '{どう やら} 彼 は 結婚 し て いる らしい よ。'
      - '{どう やら} 彼 は ご 結婚 なさっ た らしい です よ。'
      - '{どう やら} 彼、結婚 し てる っぽい よ。'
    english_literally: Apparently, he is apparently married.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 結婚 し て いる {よう だ} よ。
        english: It seems he's married (based on observation).
        hint: 「～ようだ」 implies an observation or impression, while {どうやら} emphasizes your personal deduction
          from various pieces of information. We're looking for a deduction based on various hints. Therefore,
          this sentence would be translated using {どうやら} to emphasize that deduction rather than a simple
          observation.
    scene: Two friends are gossiping about a mutual acquaintance, connecting various pieces of information
      to draw a conclusion.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
  - english: It seems our neighbor, Mr. Suzuki, is apparently going to England next month.
    japanese:
      - お 隣 の 鈴木 さん が {どう やら} 来月 から イギリス に 行く らしい です よ。
      - お 隣 の 鈴木 さん、{どう やら} 来月 イギリス 行く らしい よ。
      - '{どう やら} お 隣 の 鈴木 さん は 来月 イギリス へ 行か れる よう です。'
    english_literally: Our neighbor, Mr. Suzuki, apparently next month from England go apparently polite.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 隣 の 鈴木 さん が 来月 から イギリス に 行く {よう です} よ。
        english: It seems our neighbor, Mr. Suzuki, is going to England next month (based on observation).
        hint: 「～ようだ」 implies an observation or impression, while {どうやら} emphasizes your personal deduction.
          We're looking for a deduction based on various bits of information. Therefore, this sentence
          would be translated using {どうやら} to emphasize that deduction rather than a simple observation.
    scene: Two neighbors are sharing recent news about someone they both know, having gathered bits of
      information.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
  - english: Looks like I left the light on. Sorry about that.
    japanese:
      - '{どう やら} 俺 は 電気 を つけ っぱなし に し た らしい。すみ ませ ん。'
      - '{どう やら} 電気 を つけ っぱなし に し て しまっ た よう です。申し訳 あり ませ ん。'
      - '{どう やら} 電気 を つけ っぱなし に し て た みたい。ごめん。'
    english_literally: Apparently, I left the electricity on. Sorry.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 俺 は 電気 を つけ っぱなし に し た {よう だ}。すみ ませ ん。
        english: It seems I left the light on. Sorry about that.
        hint: 「～ようだ」 implies an observation or impression, while {どうやら} emphasizes your personal deduction
          upon realizing something. We're looking for a sentence that shows a sudden realization and deduction.
          Therefore, this sentence would be translated using {どうやら} to emphasize that deduction, rather
          than a simple observation.
    scene: A young man walks into a room, notices the light on, and realizes he made a mistake.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The speaker uses 「俺」 (ore), a casual first-person pronoun typically used by young men, indicating
      a male speaker in a relaxed setting. The tone is one of mild self-reprimand upon discovering something.
      The use of {どうやら} emphasizes this is a personal realization, not just an observation, as it indicates
      a deduction made by the speaker about their own actions based on the current situation. The phrase
      「つけっぱなしにしたらしい」 further reinforces the speaker's conclusion or deduction about their own action,
      rather than a simple statement of fact or observation of the state.
  - english: It seems like it's going to rain, given how dark the sky is.
    japanese:
      - 空 が {どう やら} 降り そう な 暗 さ だ な。
      - 空 の 感じ から {どう やら} 雨 が 降り そう だ ね。
      - '{どう やら} 雨 が 降り そう だ、この 空 の 色 は。'
    english_literally: The sky apparently is a darkness that looks like it will rain.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 空 が 降り {そう} な 暗 さ だ ね。
        english: The sky is a darkness that looks like it will rain.
        hint: Without {どうやら}, the sentence states a direct observation. We're looking for a sentence that
          conveys a deduction based on observed circumstances.
    scene: Someone looks out the window, observing the dark clouds and deducing it will rain soon.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    nuance: The sentence-ending particle 「な」 (na) is used here to express a casual, reflective tone, often
      used by male speakers to share a thought or observation with themselves or a close listener. The
      use of {どうやら} here emphasizes that the conclusion about rain is a deduction based on the visual
      evidence of the sky's darkness.
  - english: It seems the project deadline will apparently be extended, considering the current progress.
    japanese:
      - 現在 の 進捗 状況 から 見 て、プロジェクト の 締め切り は {どう やら} 延長 さ れる よう です。
      - 今 の 進み 具合 から {どう やら} プロジェクト の 締め切り は 延び そう です。
      - 現状 を 鑑み る と、締め切り は {どう やら} 延長 と なり そう です。
    english_literally: Considering the current progress situation, the project's deadline apparently seems
      like it will be extended.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 現在 の 進捗 状況 から 見 て、プロジェクト の 締め切り は 延長 さ れる {そう です}。
        english: I hear the project deadline will be extended, considering the current progress.
        hint: 「～そうです」 (hearsay) indicates information received from others. We're looking for a sentence
          that emphasizes the speaker's own professional deduction from the data.
    scene: A project manager is reviewing progress reports and concluding the inevitable.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
  - english: It seems our cat has apparently found a new favorite napping spot.

      - '{どう やら} うち の 猫 は 新しい 寝床 が 気 に 入っ た よう です わ。'
    english_literally: Our cat apparently seems to have found a new favorite sleeping place.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - うち の 猫 は 新しい お 気 に 入り の 寝床 を 見つけ た {みたい だ} ね。
        english: Our cat seems to have found a new favorite napping spot.
        hint: 「～みたいだね」 conveys a more direct, casual observation. We're looking for a sentence that implies
          a deduction based on various little signs the cat has given.
    scene: A woman observes her cat always sleeping in a new, unusual spot and deduces it's a new favorite.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The sentence-ending particle 「わ」 (wa) is characteristic of female speech, adding a gentle
      and often self-affirming or slightly emphatic tone. The use of {どうやら} here suggests the speaker
      has noticed a pattern or various subtle signs that lead her to conclude the cat has found a new
      spot, rather than it being an obvious, single event.
  - english: It seems young people these days don't bother to read newspapers anymore.
    japanese:
      - 最近 の 若者 は {どう やら} 新聞 を 読ま ない よう だ のう。

      - '{どう やら} 最近 の 若者 は 新聞 を 手 に し ない よう だ。'

        english: I heard young people these days don't read newspapers.
        hint: 「～そうだ」 (hearsay) implies you've been told this information. We're looking for a statement
          that sounds like a personal deduction or observation from someone reflecting on the trends.
    scene: An older person, perhaps sitting in a cafe, observes the lack of newspaper readers among the
      younger generation.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The ending particle 「のう」 (nō) is often used by older speakers, particularly men, to express
      a contemplative or somewhat nostalgic sentiment. The use of {どうやら} here suggests that this conclusion
      is drawn from various observations over time, rather than a single piece of information, highlighting
      the speaker's personal inference about a generational shift.
  - english: It seems I've lost my wallet again. Oh no.
    japanese:

        english: It seems I lost my wallet again. Oh no.
        hint: 「～ようだ」 is a general observation. We're looking for a sentence that shows a sudden realization

    scene: Someone frantically searches their pockets and bag, then realizes the unfortunate truth.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 今日、コーヒー だけ で 動い て いる {そう だ} よ。
        english: I heard he's running on coffee alone today.
        hint: 「～そうだ」 (hearsay) indicates you received this information from someone else. We're looking
          for a sentence that expresses your own deduction based on observing his behavior.
    scene: A colleague observes another's exhausted but highly caffeinated state at work.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
post_example_writeup: 「どうやら」 adds a layer of uncertainty or conjecture. Use it when you want to express
  that something is likely, but not certain, based on available information or your personal deduction.
