    "etymology": "The prefix 真 (ma), originating from the kanji 真 (shin) meaning \"true\" or \"genuine,\" is used to emphasize the degree or trueness of a following word. It adds a sense of \"completely,\" \"exactly,\" or \"genuinely\" to the meaning. Its evolution reflects the human desire to express absolute qualities, transforming a word for 'truth' into a intensifier for states and conditions.",
    "writeup": "The prefix 真 (ma), coming from the kanji 真 (true), is attached to words in Japanese to express that something is **completely**, **exactly**, or **genuinely**. Depending on the word that follows 真, different euphonic changes will occur to 真.\n\nWhen linked with a ま column, or な column word, 真 will become 真ん (man). For instance, 丸 (maru) becomes 真ん丸 (manmaru).\n\nWhen linked with a か column, さ column, or しゃ sound word, 真 will become 真っ (mat). Examples include 真っ直ぐ (massugu) and 真っ逆さま (massakasama).\n\nWhen linked with a は column, 真 will become 真っ, and the first kana of the following word will change to a 'P' sound. For example, 裸 (hadaka) becomes 真っ裸 (mappadaka), and 昼間 (hiruma) becomes 真っ昼間 (mappiruma).\n\nThere are several exceptions to the standard changes that happen when using 真 as a prefix. For example, when linked with 青い (aoi), 真 will become 真っ, and 青い will become 真っ青 (massao). Similarly, when linked with 赤い (akai), 真 will become 真っ, and 赤い will become 真っ赤 (makka). These specific combinations are fixed expressions that you will encounter frequently.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "This grammar point is a prefix and does not typically have false friends in the sense of easily confused expressions. However, it is crucial to understand that it serves to emphasize the following word, often a color or a state, conveying a sense of completeness or exactness. Distinguishing it from simple adjectives or adverbs relies on recognizing this intensification of meaning. While other adverbs like とても (totemo) or とても (taihen) also express 'very' or 'extremely,' 真 (ma) uniquely integrates with the word it modifies, often changing its pronunciation, to create a single, intensified concept.",
