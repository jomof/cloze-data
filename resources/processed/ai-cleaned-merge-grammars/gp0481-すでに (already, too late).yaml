    "etymology": "The word 「すでに (sudeni)」 originally comes from the verb 「過ぐ (sugu)」, meaning \"to pass\" or \"to exceed\". Over time, it evolved to mean \"already\" or \"previously\", implying that a certain point in time has already passed, highlighting the finality of the state or action.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「すでに」 serves as a formal alternative to 「もう」, both conveying the meaning of \"already\". However, 「すでに」 carries deeper nuances beyond simple completion, often implying that a situation is un changeable or that it is, indeed, too late to alter it. It conveys a strong sense of finality and absolute completion. Consider the multifaceted meaning of 「すでに」 through these underlying nuances: *   **のこらず (nokorazu)**: Implies \"nothing remaining\" or \"completely\". The state is fully established with nothing left to be done or changed. *   **あまねく (amaneku)**: Suggests \"all around\" or \"universally\". The condition is widespread or applies to everything. *   **ことごとく (kotogotoku)**: Means \"altogether\" or \"entirely\". Everything related to the matter is encompassed. *   **もはや (mohaya)**: Reinforces \"already\" with a sense of \"by now\" or \"no longer\". It often emphasizes a point of no return. *   **まぎれもなく (magiremonaku)**: Signifies \"beyond doubt\" or \"unmistakably\". The situation is unequivocally confirmed. These seemingly disparate nuances collectively reveal the core meaning of 「すでに」: a state of complete and immutable establishment. It is precisely this implication of unchangeability that leads to its frequent use in contexts where something is \"too late\", signifying that no further action can be taken or that the outcome is irreversible.",

            "nuance": "Both convey something has already happened. 「すでに」 focuses on the state of being completed or established. 「とっくに」 emphasizes the passage of time, meaning something happened a long time ago and often carries a sense of \"way past due\" or \"it should have happened by now\". It can also imply a slight exasperation. 「すでに」 can be used for things that happened very recently, as long as they are fully established, whereas 「とっくに」 implies a more significant duration.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing between 「すでに」, 「もう」, 「とっくに」, and 「今更」, it is crucial to consider the nuances of formality, emphasis on completion, the passage of time, and emotional connotation. 「すでに」 denotes that an action or state is already established, often with a sense of formality, finality, or unchangeability. 「もう」 is the most versatile and common, simply indicating \"already\" or \"anymore\" in a neutral or casual context. 「とっくに」 emphasizes that something happened a long time ago, often implying that it's past due or that the speaker is slightly exasperated that the listener didn't realize it sooner. Finally, 「今更」 conveys that something is too late to be meaningful or effective, carrying a strong connotation of regret or futility. While 「すでに」 focuses on the accomplished state, 「とっくに」 on the elapsed time, and 「今更」 on the missed opportunity, all three convey a sense of being \"too late\" in different ways.",
