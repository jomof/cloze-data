    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に堪えない」 is derived from 「堪える(たえる)」, a verb meaning \"to endure,\" \"to bear,\" or \"to tolerate.\" The addition of 「ない」 negates this, creating the sense of something being unbearable or intolerable. The particle 「に」 functions to indicate the purpose or reason for the inability to endure.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「に堪えない」 conveys the meaning of \"cannot bear to,\" \"cannot stand to,\" or \"cannot tolerate.\" It is formed by combining the particle 「に」 with the negative form of the ru-verb 「堪える(たえる)」, meaning \"to tolerate\" or \"to endure.\" When used with verbs, it signifies that an action or experience is so overwhelming, unpleasant, or unacceptable that one simply cannot bring themselves to endure it. It expresses a strong, internal reaction of repulsion or extreme discomfort towards the subject.",
