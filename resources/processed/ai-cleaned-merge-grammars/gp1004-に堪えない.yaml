        "[Verb in Dictionary Form] + に堪えない": "Indicates something is unbearable or intolerable.",

    "etymology": "The grammar point に堪えない combines the particle に with the negative form of the verb 堪える (たえる), which means \"to endure,\" \"to bear,\" or \"to tolerate.\" Thus, literally, it means \"not able to endure.\"",
    "writeup": "に堪えない is a construction that translates as \"to not be able to bear (A)\" or \"to not be able to tolerate (A).\" It combines the particle に with the negative form of the る-verb 堪える (taeru), meaning \"to tolerate,\" resulting in 堪えない (taenai). In this meaning, に堪えない follows verbs.\n\nThis contrasts with the に堪えない grammar point that follows nouns, meaning \"to be very (A)\", but more literally, \"to be so (A) I can't stand it.\"\n\nAlthough 堪える is used more often, 耐える (taeru), meaning \"to withstand,\" may be used when the emphasis is on the ability to endure (A), while 絶える (taeru), meaning \"to discontinue\" or \"to peter out,\" may be used when the emphasis is on not being able to suppress (A), especially strong feelings.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The affirmative form of に堪える may express that something is \"worth doing,\" similar to \"to be passable for (A).\" It highlights that something acceptably falls into category (A), despite not being intended or expected for it.",
