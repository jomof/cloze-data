    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に堪えない」 is derived from 「堪える(たえる)」, a verb meaning \"to endure,\" \"to bear,\" or \"to tolerate.\" The addition of 「ない」 negates this, creating the sense of something being unbearable or intolerable. The particle 「に」 functions to indicate the purpose or reason for the inability to endure.",
    "writeup": "The construction 「に堪えない」 translates to \"cannot bear to,\" \"cannot stand to,\" or \"cannot tolerate.\" It combines the particle 「に」 with the negative form of the verb 「堪える(たえる)」, which means \"to tolerate.\" This grammar point expresses the idea that something is so unpleasant, extreme, or outrageous that one cannot endure or tolerate it.\n\n*   It's important to note that 「堪える」 can also be written as 「耐える」, which means \"to withstand.\" While both are acceptable, 「耐える」 emphasizes the ability to endure something.\n*   The affirmative form 「に堪える」 has a different meaning, indicating that something is \"worth doing\" or \"passable.\" Be careful not to confuse the affirmative and negative forms.",
