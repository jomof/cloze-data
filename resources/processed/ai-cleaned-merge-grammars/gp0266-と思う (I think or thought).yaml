    or written contexts or with more assertion. 「だ」 is often omitted in casual speech for nouns and な-adjectives,
    which softens the statement and makes it less direct.

jlpt: N4
etymology: The grammar point 「とおもう」 is derived from the particle 「と」, which indicates content or quotation,
  and the verb 「思う(おもう)」, meaning "to think". Together, they form a structure to express one's thoughts
  or opinions.
writeup: |-
  To express what you "think" in Japanese, the common expression 「と 思う」 is regularly used. This is a combination of the particle 「と」, plus the verb 「思う(おもう)」. 「と 思う」 can be used after any verb, い-adjective, な-adjective, or noun. When used with nouns or な-adjectives in formal or written contexts, or when making a more assertive statement, 「だ」 is typically inserted before 「と 思う」.

  Although this structure usually requires 「だ」 after nouns and な-adjectives in formal settings, it is very often omitted in casual speech. This omission contributes to a softer, less assertive tone, and is particularly common in feminine speech or when softening a statement in general. For example, a young woman might say 「この 本 は 美味しい と 思う」 (I think this book is delicious) rather than 「この 本 は 美味しい だ と 思う」.

  **Important Considerations**

  *   If you want to express what *someone else* is thinking, 「と 思っている」 is used. This is because 「と 思う」, in its simple form, has a sense of permanence or direct access to the speaker's mind, and thus is not something the speaker could know about another person. 「と 思っている」 can also be used to express your own thoughts when they are currently happening or are ongoing. For example, 「彼 は 嘘つき だ と 思っている」 (He thinks he's a liar) or 「来週 の 旅行 が 楽しみ だ と 思っています」 (I'm thinking that next week's trip will be fun).

  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う
    meaning: I intend to, I think I will
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「と 思う」, 「〜よう と 思う」 expresses intention or a plan for the future. 「と 思う」 expresses a
      thought or opinion.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-よう]思う (intend to)'
  - term: ようだ
    meaning: It seems that, It appears that, It looks like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようだ」 expresses a judgment based on external observation or sensory perception, implying objective
      evidence. 「と 思う」 expresses a subjective personal opinion or belief.
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
  - term: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems・I hear)'
    meaning: Appears to be, I heard that, seems that (based on indirect information or hearsay)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「らしい」 indicates conjecture based on indirect information, reports, or common knowledge, often
      meaning "it seems like (from what I hear/know)". 「と 思う」 conveys your own direct, personal thought
      or belief.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
post_false_friends_writeup: The key difference is that 「と 思う」 expresses a thought or opinion, whereas
  「〜よう と 思う」 indicates intention or a plan. Furthermore, while 「ようだ」 and 「らしい」 also express appearances
  or conjectures, they are based on external evidence or hearsay, respectively, unlike 「と 思う」 which is
  a direct personal thought. Pay close attention to the verb form preceding 「と 思う」 and the source of information
  for appearances to distinguish these meanings.

        hint: 「です」 is a direct statement about the book. 「と 思う」 expresses your personal opinion, softening
          the statement. We're looking for an expression of opinion, not a direct assertion.

        hint: 「親切 だ」 is a direct statement. 「親切 と 思う」 expresses your subjective opinion, softening the
          statement, especially when 「だ」 is omitted. We're looking for a subjective opinion.
    scene: A young woman talking to her friend about a new acquaintance.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The usage of 「親切 と 思う」 without 「だ」 is common in casual feminine speech when expressing a personal
      impression, softening the statement and making it sound less direct. This phrasing often comes across
      as more gentle and reflective of a personal sentiment rather than a factual assertion.

          - あの 映画 は {面白かっ た}。

        hint: 「面白かった」 is a factual statement about the movie. 「面白かった と 思った」 expresses your past opinion
          or impression of it, emphasizing your subjective feeling at the time. We're looking for a past
          subjective opinion.

          doubt or disagreement.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は {正しい}。
        english: She is correct.
        hint: 「正しい」 states a fact. 「正しい と 思っている」 expresses someone's ongoing belief or state of mind,
          typically used when reporting another's thoughts (as you cannot truly know their internal thoughts).
          We're looking for an expression of another person's ongoing thought or belief.
    scene: Two friends discussing a third person's stubbornness.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: This usage specifically implies that the speaker is conveying someone else's belief or state
      of mind, which is inferred rather than directly known. The casual 「って 思ってる」 is particularly common
      among male speakers when informally referencing another person's thoughts. This contrasts with the
      simple 「と 思う」, which is typically for the speaker's own current thoughts and not for reporting others'.

      - 来週 の 旅行 が 楽しみ {だ と 思っ て い ます}。

          - 来週 の 旅行 が 楽しみ {です}。
        english: I am looking forward to next week's trip.
        hint: 「楽しみ です」 is a direct statement of enjoyment. 「楽しみ だ と 思っています」 conveys that your anticipation
          is an ongoing thought process, emphasizing the continuous nature of the feeling. We're looking
          for an ongoing thought rather than a static emotion.
    scene: Someone sharing their excitement about an upcoming trip.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: excited
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
  - english: That way of thinking seems understandable.

      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな 考え 方 は {分かる}。
        english: That way of thinking is understandable.
        hint: While 「分かる」 means 'I understand' or 'it is understandable', 「分かる と 思える」 expresses that it
          *seems* or *can be thought* to be understandable, implying a more objective assessment or possibility
          from a broader perspective. We're looking for an expression of objective possibility or appearance.
    scene: Someone evaluating a difficult concept and finding it comprehensible.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    conjugation: potential (～られる/～える)
  - english: He is believed to have important information.
    japanese:

      - 彼 が 重要 な 情報 を 持っ て いる {と 思わ れ ます}。
    english_literally: He, it is believed, possesses important information.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 重要 な 情報 を 持っ て いる {だろう}。
        english: He probably has important information.
        hint: 「だろう」 expresses probability based on personal conjecture. 「と 思われる」 indicates a general belief
          or opinion held by others, often used in more formal or objective contexts to present a widely
          held view. We're looking for an general belief or consensus.
    scene: Colleagues speculating about a confidential matter.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: passive (～られる/～かれる)
  - english: I will try to think about it for a while.
    japanese:
      - ちょっと 考え て {と 思う}。
      - ちょっと 考え て {と 思い ます}。
    english_literally: I will think about it for a while.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ちょっと {考える}。
        english: I will think about it.
        hint: While 「考える」 is a direct statement of intent to think, 「考えて と 思う」, though less common than
          「考えよう と 思う」 for intention, can sometimes imply a softer, more reflective resolve to think. We're
          looking for a slightly softened commitment to thinking something over.
    scene: A person agreeing to consider a proposal, but not committing immediately.
    register: casual
    setting: negotiating
    nuance: In this context, while 「考えよう と 思う」 is more direct for 'I intend to think,' the simple 「と 思う」
      after a verb in the て-form (like 考えて) can sometimes express a gentler, less firm internal decision
      or contemplation, almost like 'I'm thinking of trying to think it over.' This usage is less common
      but exists in very casual speech for softening.
  - english: I didn't think it would be such a difficult problem.
    japanese:
      - こんな に 難しい 問題 {だ と 思わ なかっ た}。
      - こんな に 難しい 問題 {と 思わ なかっ た}。
      - こんな に 難しい 問題 {だ と 思い ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: I didn't think it was such a difficult problem.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - こんな に 難しい 問題 {だっ た}。
        english: It was such a difficult problem.
        hint: 「問題 だっ た」 states a past fact. 「問題 だ と 思わなかった」 expresses your prior expectation or opinion
          that turned out to be incorrect. We're looking for an expression of a past mistaken belief.
    scene: A student reflecting on a challenging exam question.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
  - english: You should not think about negative things.
    japanese:
      - 悪い こと ばかり {と 思わ ない} ほう が いい よ。
      - 悪い こと ばかり {と 思わ ない} ほう が いい です よ。
    english_literally: It is better not to think only about bad things.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 悪い こと ばかり 考え {ない ほう が いい よ}。
        english: It's better not to think about only bad things.
        hint: While 「考えない」 is a direct negative instruction, 「思わない」 in this context implies not holding
          certain thoughts or opinions, making it a broader advisory. We're looking for advice about not
          harboring certain thoughts.
    scene: An older sibling advising a younger one who is feeling down.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Used to give advice, implying that it is better not to have or dwell on certain thoughts or
      opinions. The casual 「〜ない ほうが いい よ」 is a common way for an older person to advise a younger one,
      conveying care without being overly prescriptive.
post_example_writeup: The usage of 「と 思う」 is highly flexible and context-dependent. Remember that the
  plain form of verbs and adjectives is used before 「と 思う」, with nouns and な-adjectives sometimes taking
  「だ」 depending on formality and desired assertiveness. Pay close attention to the specific nuance conveyed
  by different conjugations of 思う, especially with progressive and potential forms.
