meaning: is incomparable
pronunciation:
  katakana: トワヒカクニナラナイ
  romaji: to wa hikaku ni naranai
formation:
  '[Noun] とは比較にならない': Used to emphasize that something is so superior or inferior that it cannot be adequately
    compared to something else.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  function: Expresses strong negative comparison, highlighting a significant difference in quality, scale,
    or degree.
  nuance: Conveys that one thing is so vastly superior or inferior that a comparison with the other is
    meaningless or inappropriate. It often carries a sense of admiration (for the superior item) or disdain
    (for the inferior item).
etymology: The phrase combines と (to), a particle indicating comparison or quotation, は (wa), the topic
  marker, 比較 (hikaku), meaning "comparison," and にならない (ni naranai), the negative potential form of になる
  (ni naru), "to become." Literally, it means "does not become a comparison" or "is not able to be compared."
  The とは emphasizes the absolute nature of the incomparability, often setting the topic apart.
writeup: とは比較にならない is a powerful expression used to state that something is so vastly different in quality,
  scale, or importance that comparing it to something else would be inappropriate or meaningless. It conveys
  a strong sense of **incomparability**, often implying that one item is significantly superior or inferior
  to the other. This phrase goes beyond simply stating a difference; it asserts that the gap is so wide
  that a meaningful comparison cannot even be made. It's frequently employed when praising something exceptional
  or criticizing something profoundly inadequate. The とは emphasizes the item being discussed, setting
  it apart as the subject of this strong assertion of incomparability.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜より
    meaning: than (comparison)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜より is a simple comparative particle, merely indicating that one thing is more (or less) of
      something than another. It implies a measurable difference on the same scale, whereas とは比較にならない
      suggests an unbridgeable gap.
    grammar_point: より (comparative)
  - term: 〜とは違う
    meaning: is different from
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜とは違う simply states that two things are not the same. It does not carry the strong evaluative
      nuance or the sense of absolute incomparability found in とは比較にならない.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:と違う (similarity and contrast)
  - term: 〜どころか
    meaning: far from it; on the contrary
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜どころか expresses a strong contradiction or a surprising negative outcome, implying something
      is even worse or completely opposite to what was expected. While it shows a large discrepancy, its
      focus is on contradiction rather than direct comparison of qualities.
    grammar_point: どころか (far from)
  - term: 〜には及ばない
    meaning: cannot compare to; is no match for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜には及ばない is very close in meaning and often interchangeable, but とは比較にならない can feel slightly
      more formal or emphatic in expressing the impossibility of comparison due to the magnitude of the
      difference. 〜には及ばない implies one simply falls short of the other, while とは比較にならない implies the comparison
      itself is absurd.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:には及ばない (no match for)
  - term: 比べものにならない
    meaning: cannot be compared; no comparison
    kind: synonym
    nuance: This is essentially the same meaning. とは比較にならない uses とは to add a slightly more formal or objective
      tone, focusing on the very nature of the comparison. 比べものにならない is perhaps slightly more colloquial
      but conveys the same core idea of incomparability.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:比べものにならない (cannot be compared)
post_false_friends_writeup: While とは比較にならない emphasizes an absolute lack of comparability due to vast differences,
  other phrases convey simpler comparisons or contradictions. For instance, 〜より simply indicates a greater
  or lesser degree of something, maintaining a common scale for comparison. 〜とは違う states a distinction
  without the strong evaluative judgment of とは比較にならない. 〜どころか points to a surprising reversal or an even
  worse situation. 〜には及ばない is very similar but focuses on one thing falling short of another. Finally,
  比べものにならない is almost identical in meaning, emphasizing that a comparison is futile. The choice among
  these often depends on the exact nuance of difference or contradiction you wish to convey, and the degree
  of emphasis on the impossibility of a valid comparison.

  - english: His talent is incomparable to anyone else's.
    japanese:

          - 彼 の 才能 は 誰 より 優れ て いる。
        english: His talent is superior to anyone's.
        hint: 「〜より優れている」 is a simple comparative structure that indicates superiority, but it doesn't
          convey the sense of absolute incomparability that the original sentence implies. We're looking
          for an expression that states a vast, unbridgeable difference in quality.
    scene: A conversation among colleagues admiring a prodigy's exceptional abilities.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: This sentence expresses profound admiration for the talent, suggesting it's on a completely

          almost immeasurable gap in quality or performance.
    scene: A tech reviewer discussing the significant upgrade of a new product over its predecessor.
    register: formal

        english: The beauty of traditional Japanese gardens is different from Western gardens.
        hint: 「〜とは異なる」 simply states a difference. The original sentence implies a qualitative distinction
          so profound that a direct comparison of 'beauty' becomes meaningless due to differing aesthetic
          principles. We're looking for a phrase that goes beyond mere difference to emphasize a unique
          aesthetic value.
    scene: A tour guide explaining the unique artistic philosophy behind Japanese gardens.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: This points out the distinct aesthetic principles that make a direct comparison culturally

        english: Her cooking is much more delicious than chain restaurant food!
        hint: 「〜よりずっとおいしい」 emphasizes a significant quantitative difference. The original sentence, with
          「とは比較にならない」, implies a qualitative difference so vast that the cooking is on an entirely different
          level of excellence. We're looking for a phrase that conveys an absolute difference in quality,
          not just a degree.
    scene: Two friends casually discussing their dining experiences, with one expressing strong admiration
      for a friend's cooking.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly

        english: The quality of their customer service is greatly different from ours.
        hint: 「大きく違う」 means 'greatly different', but it doesn't carry the same strong negative judgment
          or implication of absolute inferiority as the original phrase. We're looking for a phrase that
          dismisses any attempt at comparison due to a profound qualitative gap.
    scene: A business meeting where a company is evaluating a competitor's customer service, concluding
      it is vastly inferior.
    register: formal
    setting: professional

          that the speech's impact transcends normal comparison, implying it's in a category of its own.
          We're looking for a phrase that conveys a unique and profound level of influence.
    scene: People reflecting on a particularly powerful and memorable public address.

        english: Although he put in a lot of effort, his current skill level is no match for a professional's.
        hint: 「〜には及ばない」 means 'is no match for' and is very similar. However, 「とは比較にならない」 often implies
          a more fundamental, almost absurd, impossibility of comparison due to a vast qualitative gap,
          rather than just falling short. We're looking for a phrase that truly emphasizes the absolute
          difference.
    scene: A coach evaluating a promising but still amateur athlete, acknowledging their hard work while
      also being realistic about their current standing.
    register: formal
    setting: informative

      an amateur and a professional. It indicates that the professional's level is so far beyond that
      of the amateur that a direct comparison is not meaningful.

          else.
        hint: 「〜よりも素晴らしい」 expresses a higher degree of wonderfulness. However, 「とは比較にならない」 suggests that
          the feeling is in a unique category, making direct comparison futile. We're looking for a phrase
          that conveys an experience that is qualitatively distinct and beyond typical comparisons.
    scene: A motivational speaker sharing personal insights about perseverance and the unique reward of
      achieving long-term goals.
    register: formal
    setting: inspirational
    nuance: This conveys that the experience is uniquely profound and cannot be paralleled by other life
      events. It highlights the unparalleled nature of achieving a long-held dream.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how とは比較にならない is used to emphasize a profound qualitative
  difference, making a direct comparison inappropriate. Notice how it's used across various contexts,
  from professional evaluations to personal reflections, always highlighting an absolute gap rather than
  a mere degree of difference.
