  katakana: ジュウ
  romaji: juu
  pronunciation_warning: This grammar point specifically covers the pronunciation 「じゅう」, used to express
    the entirety or full duration of a time period or space. The pronunciation 「ちゅう」, which indicates
    being 'in the process of' an action, carries a distinct nuance and is covered separately.
formation:
  Noun + 中 (じゅう): Indicates throughout a time or space.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: suffix
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: General
  function: To denote duration throughout a time or comprehensive coverage of a space.
  nuance: Indicates duration and entirety of a time period or comprehensive coverage of a space.
  colocation: Often used with nouns related to time (e.g., 一日・一年・週末・今晩) or space (e.g., 家・国・世界・町・体).
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially, modifying the entire clause.
  temporal-flow: Describes a state or event that spans an entire period of time.
  spatial-flow: Indicates comprehensive coverage or presence within an entire space or area.
etymology: The kanji 「中」 literally means "middle" or "inside." When read as 「じゅう」 and used as a suffix,
  it signifies the full extent or entire duration of a time period or the comprehensive coverage of a
  space. This usage emphasizes the totality of the designated time or area.
writeup: 'The suffix 「中」, when read as 「じゅう」, is used to indicate that something happens or exists **throughout**
  an entire period of time or **all over** an entire space. It is attached to a noun to show comprehensive
  coverage or continuous duration. This usage of 「中」 (じゅう) highlights the ''length'' or ''space'' itself,
  signifying "all throughout" the specified time or area. For example: a day (一日中), a year (一年中), a house
  (家中), a town (町中), or a country (全国中). It is typically used with nouns that represent a fixed, measurable
  quantity of time or a defined physical space. Historically, the distinction between the readings of
  「中」 (ちゅう) and 「中」 (じゅう) often relates to their original Chinese readings (音読み) versus Japanese readings
  (訓読み). While 「じゅう」 is often associated with native Japanese words or concepts that emphasize a complete,
  predetermined unit (e.g., 今晩中 - こんばんじゅう, meaning ''all night''), it can also combine with Sino-Japanese
  words to express totality (e.g., 世界中 - せかいじゅう, meaning ''all over the world''). This grammar point is
  widely applicable across various registers, from casual to formal, depending on the preceding noun and
  overall context.'

  - term: 中 (ちゅう)
    meaning: in the process of; during
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「中」 (ちゅう) signifies being actively engaged in an action (e.g., 「勉強中」 - studying), focusing
      on the *ongoing nature* of an activity. In contrast, 「中」 (じゅう) emphasizes the *entire duration*
      or *comprehensive coverage* of a period or space.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:中 (in the process of)
  - term: とき
    meaning: When, at the time of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とき」 refers to a specific point or general period, whereas 「中」 (じゅう) emphasizes covering an
      entire duration or space.
    grammar_point: とき (when)
  - term: 最中に
    meaning: In the middle of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「最中に」 emphasizes being right in the *very midst* of an action, often with an implication of
      an unexpected interruption or a specific moment. 「中」 (じゅう) is a more neutral descriptor of continuous
      duration or complete coverage.
    grammar_point: 最中に (in the middle of)
  - term: の間に
    meaning: While, during, between, period
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「の間に」 refers to an interval between two points, implying something happens *within* that period,
      often at some unspecified point. 「中」 (じゅう) indicates something happening *throughout* the entire
      specified period or covering the *entirety* of a space.
    grammar_point: の間に (within an interval)
  - term: 全体に (throughout, entirely)
    meaning: Throughout, entirely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「全体に」 explicitly means 'to the whole' or 'all over,' which is a close synonym for 「中」
      (じゅう) when referring to space, 「中」 (じゅう) also encompasses temporal duration, making it more versatile.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:全体に (throughout, entirely)
  - term: 限り
    meaning: As long as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「限り」 sets a condition for the duration of an action or state ('as long as X is the case'),

      an additional condition.
    grammar_point: 限り (as long as)
  - term: 〜っぱなし
    meaning: Leaving something in a state
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「っぱなし」 indicates a continuous state that has been left as is, often with a negative or careless
      nuance. 「中」 (じゅう) neutrally describes something that persists throughout a period or covers an area
      without implying negligence.
    grammar_point: 〜っぱなし (leaving something in a state)
  - term: 至る所に
    meaning: Everywhere; in every place
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「至る所に」 explicitly states 'in every place,' emphasizing discrete locations across a wide area.
      「中 (じゅう)」 implies a more continuous or pervasive spread *throughout* the entire designated area
      or duration.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:至る所に (everywhere)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share some semantic overlap with 「中」 (じゅう), they each
  carry distinct nuances. 「中」 (じゅう) is particularly useful for concisely expressing being **throughout
  an entire duration** or **covering an entire span** of time or space. Pay close attention to whether
  the context implies a complete duration or comprehensive coverage to choose the most appropriate expression.

          - 一日 いつ も 雨 でし た。
        english: It was always raining for one day.
        hint: 「一日 いつ も 雨でした」 sounds unnatural and suggests constant, unchanging rain rather than the duration
          of a single day's rainfall. 「一日中」 directly conveys the continuous nature of the rain *throughout*
          the entire day. We're looking for an expression that conveys rain continuously throughout the
          entire day.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一 日間 雨 でし た。
        english: It rained for a period of one day.
        hint: 「一日間 雨でした」 indicates the duration of the rain but lacks the emphasis on it being continuous
          *throughout* the entire day, as conveyed by 「一日中」. We're looking for an expression that conveys

        english: A sweet scent is spreading inside the house.
        hint: 「家 の 中 に」 simply means 'inside the house' and doesn't convey the idea of the scent permeating
          *every part* of the house. 「家中」 (いえじゅう) emphasizes comprehensive coverage. We're looking for
          an expression that indicates the scent is everywhere in the house.

        hint: 「今年 に」 would typically imply 'in this year' for an event at a specific point. 「今年中」 (ことしじゅう)
          specifies that the action will happen *at some point within* the designated time frame, not
          necessarily at the very end. We're looking for an expression that indicates the action will
          happen at some point within the year.

        english: I want to buy a new car by this year.
        hint: 「今年 まで に」 implies a deadline ('until this year') rather than an action occurring at an unspecified
          time *within* the year. 「今年中」 is more flexible about when it happens, as long as it's within
          the period. We're looking for an expression that indicates the action will happen at some point
          within the year, not by a deadline.

      - competing_japanese:

          widespread coverage across the entire nation.
