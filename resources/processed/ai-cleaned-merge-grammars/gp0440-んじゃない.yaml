    "etymology": "んじゃない is derived from 「の」, a particle that nominalizes the preceding verb, and 「じゃない」, which is a colloquial contraction of 「ではない」 (dewa nai), meaning 'is not'. The literal sense is something like 'it is not the case that you do X'. 「ん」 is a colloquial form of 「の」.",
    "writeup": "「んじゃない」 is an informal grammar point used to prohibit someone from doing something, or to express regret about something that happened. It's often translated as \"don't do (A)\" or \"you shouldn't have (A)\". It's a combination of the particle 「の」 and the abbreviated form of 「ではない」, which is 「じゃない」.\n\nKey points:\n*   **Usage**: Generally used by someone in a higher position towards someone of lower status, and can sound harsh.\n*   **Past Tense**: 「んじゃなかった」 indicates something 'should not have been done' and carries a nuance of regret.\n*   **Intonation**: Be aware that when 「んじゃない」 comes at the end of a sentence, it can be a question (an abbreviation of 「んじゃないか」) if the intonation rises. Otherwise, it is a command.\n*   **ている Form**: It is common to see the abbreviated 「ている」 form, 「てん」, before 「じゃない」. For example, 「食べてんじゃない」 (tabeten janai) means \"Don't eat that!\"\n*   **More Polite**: The slightly more formal version 「んじゃありません」 can also be used, particularly when the speaker wishes to forbid something without sounding too angry.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "It's important to differentiate between 「んじゃない」, which is a form of direct prohibition or regret, and other similar-sounding expressions. For example, 「のではないか」 is used to soften a statement or to ask a question, while 「わけではない」 expresses a partial negation. Pay attention to the context and intonation to understand the intended meaning. In writing, the question mark often distinguishes 「んじゃない」 (as a question) from 「んじゃない」 (as a prohibition). But when speaking, the intonation of 「んじゃない」 is key.",
