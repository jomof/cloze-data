    "etymology": "んじゃない is derived from のではない (no dewa nai). の is a nominalizer, turning a verb into a noun-like phrase. で is the te-form of だ (da), and は (wa) is a topic marker. ない (nai) is the negative form of ある (aru) or だ (da). Over time, のではない contracted to んじゃない.",
    "writeup": "「んじゃない」 is a somewhat slangy grammar pattern used to prohibit an action or express a mild rebuke. It is often translated as \"Don't do (A)!\" or \"You mustn't (A)!\". The speaker usually has a higher social position or authority than the listener. While it can be used when angry, that's not always the case.\n\n「んじゃない」 is a contraction of 「のではない」, where 「の」 is a nominalizing particle and 「ではない」 is the negative form of 「だ」.\n\nThe more formal version 「んじゃありません」 is also occasionally used, especially when the speaker wants to forbid something without sounding too harsh, for example, when an adult is speaking to a child.\n\nWhen used in the past tense as 「んじゃなかった」, it indicates that something \"should not have been done\" and carries a nuance of regret or disappointment.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Intonation:** When 「んじゃない」 comes at the end of a sentence, pay attention to the intonation, as it might actually be a question—an abbreviation of 「んじゃないか」. A rising intonation indicates a question, while a falling intonation indicates an order or prohibition.\n*   **Slang Level:** This grammar point is considered somewhat slangy, so be mindful of your audience and situation when using it.\n*   **ている Form:** It is common to see the abbreviated 「ている」 form, 「てん」, before 「じゃない」.",
