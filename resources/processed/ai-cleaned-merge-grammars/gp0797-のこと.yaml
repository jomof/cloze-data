        "Usage": "Often used to introduce a subject or to clarify what is being referred to."
    },
    "etymology": "「こと (koto)」 means 'thing' or 'matter.' Attaching 「の (no)」 clarifies the relationship between the noun and the 'thing' being discussed. It essentially means 'the matter of' or 'the thing about'.",
    "writeup": "「のこと (no koto)」 is a versatile grammatical structure used to indicate \"about,\" \"concerning,\" or \"regarding\" a particular noun. It serves to specify or focus on a specific topic within a conversation or text. It's similar to 「に関して (ni kanshite)」 or 「について (ni tsuite)」, but often provides a slightly more casual or conversational feel. It can be used in both formal and informal contexts, depending on the surrounding language. Often paired with 「なんですが (nan desu ga)」 as a lead-in when you want to talk to someone about something, but in a softer, more indirect way.",
