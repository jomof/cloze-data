details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  particle-syntactic-function: purpose
  function: Expresses the purpose or objective of an action, especially motion.
  colocation: Frequently used with verbs of movement such as 行く (iku), 来る (kuru), and 帰る (kaeru). Can
    also be paired with action nouns.
  grammatical-role: Connects a verb or noun indicating purpose to the main verb of the sentence.
  temporal-flow: The purpose indicated by に precedes the main action; the main action is performed with
    that purpose in mind.
  spatial-flow: Implies movement towards a location where the stated purpose will be carried out.
etymology: The particle 「に」 generally signifies direction, location, or a point in time. When used for
  purpose, it extends this fundamental meaning. The "purpose" is the "destination" or "aim" of the action.
  So, in 「食べに行く」 (to go to eat), 「食べ」 (eating) is the target or goal that the 「行く」 (going) is directed
  towards. The etymological roots of 「に」 are very old, stemming from proto-Japanese, signifying 'location'
  or 'direction', which naturally evolved to encompass 'purpose' as a form of directional goal-setting.
writeup: 'The particle 「に」, when indicating purpose, marks the objective or goal of an Japanese action,
  particularly often with verbs of movement. It specifies *what* you are going or coming to do, or *for
  what* reason an action is being performed. It can attach to the ます-stem of a verb (e.g., 食べに, 読みに, 買いに)
  or directly to a noun that signifies an action or purpose (e.g., 買い物に, 散歩に, 勉強に). **Key Points:** *   **Verb
  ます-stem + に**: This is a common construction for expressing the purpose of movement. For example, 「映画を見に行く」
  (eiga o mi ni iku - "to go to see a movie"). The ます-stem 「見」 (mi) is used here. *   **Noun + に**: When
  the purpose is expressed by a noun, the noun itself is followed by 「に」. For instance, 「買い物に行く」 (kaimono
  ni iku - "to go shopping"). Here, 「買い物」 (kaimono - "shopping") is the noun representing the activity.
  *   **Specificity**: This 「に」 is quite specific about the immediate purpose of the action. It implies
  that the primary reason for the movement or action is the stated purpose. *   **Contrast with 「ため」**:
  While 「に」 for purpose directly links the purpose to the action, 「ため」 (tame) often implies a broader
  or more indirect purpose, or a reason/cause. For example, 「日本語を勉強するために日本へ行く」 (nihongo o benkyou suru
  tame ni nihon e iku - "to go to Japan for the purpose of studying Japanese") emphasizes the reason for
  going to Japan. 「日本へ日本語を勉強しに行く」 (nihon e nihongo o benkyou shi ni iku - "to go to Japan to study Japanese")
  is more direct about the activity performed upon arrival.'

  - term: ため・ために
    meaning: For the purpose of; in order to; because of; due to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に (purpose)」 directly states the immediate objective of an action, especially movement. 「ため・ために」
      indicates a broader reason, cause, or more general goal. While often interchangeable in some contexts,
      「に」 is more concise for direct purposes, especially with verbs of motion, whereas 「ため」 can express
      a more abstract or indirect purpose, or a reason/cause.
    grammar_point: ため・ために (for the purpose of・because of)
  - term: ように
    meaning: so that; in order to; in such a way that (purpose or desired state)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に (purpose)」 specifies a direct action's objective, often linked to physical movement. 「ように」
      expresses a purpose to achieve a certain state or outcome, implying an effort to bring about a desired
      condition, or to do something *in a way that* something else happens. It's often used with potential
      forms or verbs expressing change.
    grammar_point: ように (purpose or desired state)
  - term: へいく
    meaning: To go to, To head toward
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「へいく」 uses 「へ」 to denote direction towards a destination. While you are *going* somewhere,
      the focus is on the destination itself. 「に (purpose) 行く」 specifies *why* you are going somewhere,
      with the focus on the action you intend to perform at that destination. For example, 「学校 へ 行く」 (to
      go to school) vs. 「勉強 に 行く」 (to go to study).
    grammar_point: へいく (to head toward)
  - term: で (cause・reason)
    meaning: because of; due to; by
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「で (cause・reason)」 expresses the cause or reason for an event or state. In contrast, 「に (purpose)」
      expresses the objective or goal of an action. For example, 「風邪 で 学校 を 休む」 (to miss school due to
      a cold) explains *why* you missed school, whereas 「本 を 買い {に} 出かける」 (to go out to buy a book) explains
      *what* your purpose is in going out.
    grammar_point: で (cause・reason)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「に」, 「ため」, and 「ように」 to express purpose, consider the
  directness and type of purpose. 「に」 is best for the immediate objective of an action, especially movement.
  「ため」 is suitable for broader goals or reasons. 「ように」 focuses on achieving a desired state or outcome.
  The particle 「へ」 indicates direction, while 「で」 indicates cause or means.
