        "Noun1 が Noun2 なら ~": "Expresses a hypothetical situation where Noun1 being a proper or ideal version of Noun2 would lead to a different, often better, outcome.  Implies that the current reality falls short of this ideal.",

    "meaning": "If (something) were a proper/ideal (something); if (something) were the real deal.",
    "details": {
        "Function": "Expresses a hypothetical situation where something being its ideal self would change the outcome. It carries a sense of disappointment or regret that the current reality isn't up to par.",
        "Nuance": "Implies a gap between the current state and an ideal state.",
        "Common constructions": "Often used with expressions like 「～だろう」 (probably), 「～かもしれない」 (might be), or 「～のに」 (if only).",
        "Register": "Can be used in both formal and informal settings, depending on the context and the specific nouns used."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「が」, indicating a subject, with 「なら」, the conditional form of the copula 「だ」.  Essentially, it sets up a conditional statement where the noun is hypothetically in a better or more ideal state. It highlights the discrepancy between the hypothetical ideal and the current reality.",
    "writeup": "「Noun+が~なら」 expresses a hypothetical situation, suggesting that if something were a true or ideal version of itself, the outcome would be different or better. It often carries a sense of regret or disappointment about the current state of affairs. The nuance implies a contrast between the actual situation and an idealized version.\n\nIt is often used with expressions such as 「～だろう」 (probably) or 「～かもしれない」 (might be) to indicate a degree of uncertainty about the hypothetical outcome. The formula to create this grammar point is 「Noun1 が Noun2 なら」, where Noun1 is hypothetically the proper form of Noun2.  For example, 「病院 が 病院 なら 治っていただろう」 (If that hospital were a *real* hospital, someone might have been cured).",
