        "Register": "Varies depending on the context, but often used in situations expressing regret or hypothetical improvements.",
        "Usage": "Used to express a counterfactual situation, implying that things would be better if a particular noun were of higher quality or more appropriate.",
        "Structure": "Noun1 が Noun2 なら"
    },
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Noun が Noun なら」 is used to express a hypothetical situation where if the first noun were a 'true' or 'better' version of the second noun, things would be different or better. It often carries a sense of regret or wishful thinking. The second noun acts as a qualifier or ideal state for the first noun. \n\nFor example, saying 「会社が会社なら」 implies that if the company were a 'real' company (i.e., well-managed, successful), things would be better. This grammar point is frequently followed by expressions like 「〜だろう」 (probably) or 「〜かもしれない」 (might be).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The two nouns are usually the same or closely related, with the first being a specific instance and the second being an idealized version.\n*   This structure often conveys a sense of disappointment or resignation about the current state of affairs.",
    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the particle 「が」, which marks the subject, with 「なら」, the conditional form of the copula 「だ」. Essentially, it creates a conditional statement highlighting a discrepancy between what is and what could be. The repetition of the noun emphasizes the desired quality or state.",

            "etymology": "医者 (isha) means doctor, hence if the subject can't perform basic medical services, the speaker is doubtful that he is a real doctor."
