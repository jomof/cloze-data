        "Noun が Noun なら": "Used when the first Noun is a repetition of the second Noun, emphasizing that if the thing in question were an ideal or proper example of itself.",
        "Noun が Noun なら (だろう/かもしれない/のに)": "Often followed by auxiliary expressions like だろう, かもしれない, or のに to indicate hypothetical outcomes, uncertainty, or regret."
    },
    "jlpt": "N2",
    "meaning": "If (something) were a proper/ideal (something); if (something) were the real deal.",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used to express disappointment, regret, or a critical assessment regarding the actual state of something compared to its ideal form.",
        "function": "To express a hypothetical situation where something being its ideal self would change the outcome, often implying that the current reality falls short.",
        "nuance": "Implies a significant gap between the current state and an idealized standard, conveying a sense of lament or dissatisfaction. The repetition of the noun intensifies this feeling.",
        "colocation": "Often used with modal expressions such as 「～だろう」 (probably), 「～かもしれない」 (might be), or 「～のに」 (if only) to indicate the nature of the hypothetical outcome or the speaker's regret."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「が」, indicating a subject, with 「なら」, the conditional form of the copula 「だ」. Essentially, it sets up a conditional statement where the noun is hypothetically in a better or more ideal state. It highlights the discrepancy between the hypothetical ideal and the current reality.",
    "writeup": "「Noun が Noun なら」 is a grammatical construction used to express a hypothetical situation where something, if it were its ideal or proper self, would lead to a different, often better, outcome. It carries a strong nuance of disappointment or regret, implying that the current reality falls short of this ideal state.\n\n The structure involves repeating the same noun: 「Noun が Noun なら」. For example, 「会社 が 会社 なら」 (If the company were a *real* company). This repetition serves to emphasize the contrast between the actual entity and its idealized form.\n\nThis pattern is frequently followed by expressions such as 「～だろう」 (probably), 「～かもしれない」 (might be), or 「～のに」 (if only) to articulate the hypothetical consequence or the speaker's lament. For instance, 「病院 が 病院 なら 治っていただろう」 (If that hospital were a *real* hospital, someone might have been cured). This structure is versatile and can be used in both formal and informal contexts, depending on the specific nouns and the overall tone of the sentence.",

                    "mitigation": "The phrase 「車 が 車 なら」 suggests the car *itself* failed to live up to the expectations of what a car should be, not just that it was of poor quality generally. The scene highlights the contrast between the minor incident and the excessive damage, emphasizing the car's inherent inadequacy rather than merely attributing the damage to low quality."

            "nuance": "The repetition of 「車 が 車 なら」 underscores the speaker's disappointment in the vehicle's inadequate quality, implying it doesn't meet the basic standards of what a 'car' should represent in terms of durability. The phrase 「壊れなかった はず だ」 expresses a strong expectation that was not met."

The humorous setting emphasizes this playful yet frustrated comparison."

                    "mitigation": "While the cat might be untrainable, 「猫 が 猫 なら」 focuses on an inherent quality—the expectation of what a 'cat' should be—rather than just the result of training. The scene highlights the animal's willful disregard for human instruction, suggesting a deeper gap between expectation and reality."

The context of a failed project reinforces the idea that the proposal was inherently flawed, not just suboptimal."
