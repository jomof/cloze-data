formation:
  '[Noun/Phrase] + が + 気になる': Expresses interest or concern about something or someone. The subject of
    the sentence (which can be omitted) is the person experiencing the feeling, and the thing causing
    the feeling is marked by が. This indicates a spontaneous or involuntary feeling, where something simply
    'becomes' a matter of one's attention or feelings, rather dreaded than a conscious decision to focus
    on it. It describes a state where something draws one's attention, whether out of curiosity, mild
    worry, or attraction, and the object of this feeling is what 'becomes' a concern or interest to the
    speaker. Therefore, the phrase can be understood as 'something causes one's mind to be occupied' or
    'something becomes a subject of one's thoughts or feelings'.
jlpt: N2
details:
  usage-context: It indicates a natural inclination towards something, not necessarily a deliberate focus.
    It is often used to express mild interest or concern. This grammar point is versatile and can be used
    in various contexts, from casual conversation to more formal settings.
  function: To express that something draws one's attention or becomes a concern.
  nuance: Describes a passive, involuntary feeling of interest or concern, as opposed to an active, conscious
    decision.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a compound verb phrase, where the noun preceding が is the subject of
    the spontaneous feeling or attention.
  temporal-flow: Describes a change in state where something comes to mind or begins to concern one.
  spatial-flow: Can imply a mental shift, where attention moves towards a particular object or situation.
etymology: The grammar point 「が気になる」 is derived from the noun 「気」 (ki), meaning 'spirit,' 'mind,' or 'feeling,'
  combined with the particle 「に」 and the verb 「なる」 (naru), meaning 'to become.' Therefore, it literally
  translates to 'something becomes of one's interest' or 'something becomes a concern.' This construction
  highlights the involuntary nature of the feeling, as if the object itself acts upon one's 'ki,' drawing
  it in. This reflects the traditional Japanese concept of 'ki' as an invisible energy or spirit that
  can be influenced or directed.
writeup: |-
  「が気になる」 expresses a state of being interested in or concerned about something. 「気」 refers to one's spirit, mind, or feeling, and 「になる」 means 'to become'. So, literally, something 'becomes of one's concern.' It is commonly used to express curiosity, worry, or a general interest in a topic, person, or situation. It indicates a natural inclination towards something, not necessarily a deliberate focus. It is often used to express mild interest or concern. This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts, from casual conversation to more formal settings.

  Unlike 「気にする」, which implies a more active and deliberate focus on something, often due to worry or concern, 「が気になる」 highlights that something is naturally becoming a focus due to the speaker's spontaneous interest or underlying concern. It is a more passive experience, where the external entity draws the speaker's attention.

  While this grammar point is generally gender-neutral and age-neutral, the context of its usage can imply certain demographics. For instance, expressing a mild, lingering concern might be more common in polite or reflective conversation, while a more direct expression of interest could appear in casual settings. It doesn't have strong regional variations.
false_friends:
  - term: 気にする
    meaning: to mind, to worry about, to care about
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「が気になる」, 「気にする」 implies a more active and deliberate focus on something, often due
      to worry or concern. It suggests a conscious effort not to ignore something, or to actively pay
      attention to it.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:を気にする (to mind)
  - term: 見える
    meaning: to be visible; to seem, to appear
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「が気になる」, 「見える」 relates to something being visible to the eye or how something appears
      or looks to someone. It describes visual perception or appearance, and does not express an internal
      feeling of interest or concern, nor is it about something entering one's thoughts. It is a much
      more literal and less emotional expression.
    grammar_point: 見える (to be visible・to seem)
  - term: 興味がある
    meaning: to have an interest in
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express interest, 「興味がある」 implies a more active, often intellectual interest or
      curiosity, whereas 「気になる」 suggests a more passive, spontaneous feeling of attraction or something
      simply catching one's attention, without necessarily implying a deep, conscious pursuit of knowledge.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:興味がある (to have an interest in)
  - term: 心配する
    meaning: to worry, to be anxious
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「心配する」 denotes an explicit act of worrying or being anxious, often with a stronger emotional
      intensity and a sense of active cognitive engagement with the problem. 「気になる」, on the other hand,
      describes a state where something *becomes* a concern, often implying a milder, lingering thought
      or preoccupation rather than intense, active anxiety. It's more about something being on one's mind.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:心配する (to worry)
  - term: 夢中になる
    meaning: to be absorbed in, to be crazy about
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「夢中になる」 implies a state of being completely engrossed or passionate about something, often
      to the exclusion of other things, indicating a deep, overwhelming focus. 「気になる」 is a much milder
      form of interest or concern, often a precursor to becoming 「夢中」, but without the same intensity
      or level of immersion. It merely means something has captured attention, not consumed it.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:夢中になる (to be absorbed in)
  - term: 知りたくてたまらない
    meaning: dying to know, can't help but want to know
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「知りたくてたまらない」 conveys an overwhelming, almost unbearable desire for information, an intense
      urge to find out something immediately, often to the point of discomfort. 「気になる」 indicates a persistent
      preoccupation or curiosity, but without the intense, almost unbearable longing implied by 「たまらない」.
      It is a more subtle and less demanding form of curiosity.
    grammar_point: てならない (cannot help but feel)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  「が気になる」 indicates a passive interest or concern, meaning something 'becomes' a matter of your attention or feelings. It highlights that an external factor draws your attention without a conscious decision on your part. In contrast, 「気にする」 indicates an active effort of focusing on something, meaning you 'make' it a matter of your attention or feelings, often implying a conscious decision to worry or care. For instance, if you are walking down the street and you see a cat, and your attention is drawn to it without intending to, that is 「猫が気になる」. If you deliberately try to look for the cat, or actively think about it after seeing it, that would be 「猫を気にする」. 「見える」 means 'to be visible' or 'to seem' and is unrelated to one's internal feelings or preoccupations about something; it describes objective visual perception.

  Furthermore, while 「興味がある」 also expresses interest, it implies a more conscious and often intellectual curiosity, suggesting a more deliberate engagement. 「心配する」 directly translates to 'to worry,' indicating an active state of anxiety, whereas 「気になる」 is a more subtle 'to become concerned,' where the feeling simply arises. 「夢中になる」 suggests a much stronger, engrossing passion that consumes one's attention, and 「知りたくてたまらない」 conveys an intense desire to know, far more emphatic than the mild curiosity of 「気になる」. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for choosing the most appropriate expression in various situations.
examples:
  - english: I'm curious about the dog in the house next door. What should I do?
    japanese:
      - 隣 の 家 の 犬 が {気 に なる}。
      - 隣 の 家 の 犬 が {気 に なり ます}。
      - 隣 の 家 の 犬、結構 {気 に なる} よ ね。
    english_literally: The dog of the house next door becomes a concern.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 隣 の 家 の 犬 に {興味 が ある}。
          - 隣 の 家 の 犬 の こと が {好き です}。
        english: I have an interest in the dog next door.
        hint: 「興味がある」 expresses a conscious, intellectual interest, while 「気になる」 is a more spontaneous
          feeling. We're looking for something that just captures your attention, not a deliberate study
          of it.
    scene: Two neighbors chatting about neighborhood pets.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
  - english: I'm concerned about what to wear for tomorrow's party. What should I put on?
    japanese:
      - 明日 の パーティー の 服 が {気 に なる} わ。何 を 着 て 行 こう かしら。
      - 明日 の パーティー の 服 が {気 に なっ て} 困る わ ね。
      - 明日 の パーティー の 服 が {気 に なっ ちゃっ て}。
    english_literally: Tomorrow's party clothes become a concern, huh. I wonder what I should wear.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 の パーティー の 服 で {悩ん で いる} わ。
          - 明日 の パーティー の 服 が {心配 です} わ。
        english: I'm deliberating over what to wear for tomorrow's party.
        hint: 「悩む」 means to actively ponder or struggle with a decision, implying a more deliberate thought
          process. 「気になる」 is about something simply coming to mind as a concern without necessarily involving
          deep deliberation. We're looking for the sense of something just being on your mind and occupying
          your thoughts.
    scene: A woman preparing for a social event.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The sentence-ending particle 「わ」 (as in 「気になるわ」) is a distinctly feminine particle, used here
      to express a personal feeling or concern in a soft, reflective manner. This usage clearly indicates
      a female speaker. 「困るわね」 adds a nuance of being troubled by the concern. 「～ちゃって」 is a contracted
      form of 「～てしまう」, implying an an action or state that happens spontaneously or unintentionally, adding
      to the involuntary nature of 「気になる」, as if the concern just popped up and won't leave her mind.
      The phrase expresses a natural preoccupation rather than active worrying or deep deliberation about
      the outfit choice, making 「気になる」 a fitting choice here, as the choice simply becomes a constant
      thought.
  - english: Manager, this matter, it's still concerning, isn't it?
    japanese:
      - 部 長、この 件、やはり {気 に なる} でしょ う か。
      - 部 長、この 件、やはり {気 に なり ます} でしょ う か。
      - 部 長、この 件、まだ {気 に なさい ます} か。
    english_literally: Manager, this matter, it still becomes a concern, doesn't it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 部 長、この 件、やはり {ご 懸念 です} か。
          - 部 長、この 件、まだ {心配 し て いらっしゃい ます} か。
        english: Manager, regarding this matter, are you still concerned?
        hint: 「ご懸念」 is a formal noun for 'concern' or 'anxiety', and 「心配していらっしゃる」 uses the honorific form
          of 'to worry.' While both express concern, 「気になる」 implies something is just drawing their attention
          and staying on their mind, not necessarily an active state of intense worry or deliberation.
          We're looking for a general sense of 'on one's mind' or 'lingering concern'.
    scene: A subordinate asking his male boss if he shares a concern.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The address 「部長」 (buchou, manager) is typically used when addressing a superior in a professional
      context. While the particles used are gender-neutral, this situation is common when a subordinate
      addresses their male manager, implying a male listener. The use of 「なさいますか」 or 「なさるか」 is honorific
      language (sonkeigo) for the manager's action, showing respect. 「やはり」 means 'as expected' or 'as
      I thought,' suggesting the concern is an ongoing or persistent one for the manager. The usage is
      polite and indirect, reflecting professional etiquette and a subtle inquiry into the manager's mental
      state regarding the issue, rather than a direct challenge or strong accusation of worry. This highlights
      the nuance of 「気になる」 as a more subtle and less direct expression of concern compared to 「心配する」 (to
      worry).
  - english: Mom, are you concerned about tomorrow's excursion weather?
    japanese:
      - お 母 さん、明日 の 遠足 の お 天気、{気 に なる}？
      - お 母 さん、明日 の 遠足 の お 天気、{気 に なっ てる}？
      - お 母 さん、明日 の 遠足 の お 天気、{気 に なり ます} か？
    english_literally: Mom, tomorrow's excursion weather, does it become a concern?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 母 さん、明日 の 遠足 の お 天気、{心配 し てる}？
          - お 母 さん、明日 の 遠足 の お 天気、{不安 です} か？
        english: Mom, are you worrying about tomorrow's excursion weather?
        hint: 「心配する」 indicates an active act of worrying. 「気になる」 is a more passive state, where the weather
          simply occupies one's thoughts or attracts one's attention, without necessarily being a source
          of strong anxiety. We're looking for the weather simply being on your mind.
    scene: A child asking her mother about the weather for an outing.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The address 「お母さん」 (okaasan, mother) clearly indicates a female listener. This type of direct,
      casual inquiry is typical when a child addresses their mother about a shared concern or upcoming
      event, fostering a friendly and familiar atmosphere. 「気になってる」 uses the progressive form, implying
      an ongoing state of concern or preoccupation with the weather. The overall tone is light and conversational,
      characteristic of a child's natural curiosity and slight anticipation about a future event. This
      example subtly conveys the nuance of 「気になる」 as a spontaneous thought or a persistent presence in
      one's mind rather than a deliberate choice to worry, highlighting its less intense nature compared
      to 「心配する」 (to worry).
  - english: I'm concerned about the results of the exam.
    japanese:
      - 試験 の 結果 が {気 に なる}。
      - 試験 の 結果 が {気 に なっ て} しょう が ない。
      - 試験 の 結果 が {気 に なり ます} ね。
    english_literally: The exam results become a concern.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 の 結果 が {心配 だ}。
          - 試験 の 結果 が {不安 です}。
        english: I am worried about the exam results.
        hint: 「心配だ」 expresses an active state of worry or anxiety, often implying a strong emotional response.
          「気になる」 indicates that the exam results simply occupy your thoughts or attention as a concern,
          which is a less intense and more passive feeling. We're looking for the results simply being
          on your mind and hard to ignore.
    scene: A student worrying after taking a test.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: cautious
  - english: I'm so interested in her that I can't sleep.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 の こと が {気 に なっ て}、眠れ ない。
      - 彼女 の こと が {気 に なっ て} 眠れ ませ ん。
      - 彼女 の こと、{気 に なっ て} 全然 眠れ ない ん だ よ ね。
    english_literally: Regarding her, it became a concern, and I can't sleep.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 の こと で {夢中 で}、眠れ ない。
          - 彼女 に {恋 し て}、眠れ ない。
        english: I'm so absorbed in her that I can't sleep.
        hint: 「夢中」 implies being completely engrossed or passionate, a stronger and more consuming state
          than the spontaneous interest of 「気になる」. We're looking for a more general 'on my mind' feeling
          that keeps one awake, rather than being utterly absorbed.
    scene: A person infatuated with someone.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The te-form 「気になって」 connects the feeling of interest or preoccupation directly to the consequence
      of not being able to sleep, emphasizing the intensity of the speaker's emotions. This casual register
      and intimate setting highlight the depth of infatuation, where the person's presence in one's thoughts
      is so strong it affects daily life. The use of 「全然」 (not at all) further emphasizes the complete
      inability to sleep due to this pervasive feeling. This example illustrates how 「気になる」 can describe
      a strong, lingering attraction or preoccupation that is not necessarily a conscious decision but
      rather an involuntary state of mind, common in the early stages of infatuation. The addition of
      「～ん だ よ ね」 creates a casual, explanatory tone, seeking empathy from the listener about this relatable
      feeling.
  - english: If I weren't interested in her, I'd ask someone else out.
    japanese:
      - もし 彼女 が {気 に なら} なかっ たら、他 の 人 に 声 を かける よ。
      - もし 彼女 が {気 に なら なかっ たら}、他 の 人 に 声 を かけ て た と 思う。
      - もし 彼女 が {気 に なら ない} ん だっ たら、他 の 人 に 声 を かける だろ う ね。
    english_literally: If she did not become a concern, I would call out to other people.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もし 彼女 に {興味 が なかっ たら}、他 の 人 に 声 を かける よ。
          - もし 彼女 の こと を {好き じゃ なかっ たら}、他 の 人 に 声 を かける よ。
        english: If I didn't have interest in her, I'd ask someone else out.
        hint: 「興味がある」 expresses a conscious, intellectual interest, implying a more deliberate choice.
          「気になる」 is a more spontaneous feeling of attraction or something capturing one's attention, a
          less intentional form of interest. We're looking for a more general 'on my mind' type of interest
          that prevents pursuing others.
    scene: A man deciding who to ask out.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The plain negative past conditional form 「気にならなかったら」 is used here in a casual, somewhat hypothetical
      context, indicating a hypothetical past state of not having had a lingering interest. The male speaker's
      use of 「〜よ」 at the end, as in 「声をかけるよ」, is a common sentence-ending particle strongly associated
      with masculine speech, adding a declarative or reassuring tone, suitable for this confident, flirty
      declaration. This sentence captures the nuance that this particular person (「彼女」) has involuntarily
      captured his attention or mind, thereby influencing his actions, rather than him actively choosing
      to be interested. The flirty setting is enhanced by the implication that his attention is currently
      solely on 'her'.
  - english: Lately, I can't help but be concerned about the stock price fluctuations.
    japanese:
      - 最近、株価 の 変動 が {気 に なっ て} 仕方 が ない。
      - 最近、株価 の 変動 が {気 に なっ て} しょう が ない ん です。
      - 最近、株価 の 変動 が {気 に なっ て} 仕方 あり ませ ん。
    english_literally: Recently, the fluctuation of stock prices has become such a concern that I can't
      help it.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最近、株価 の 変動 が {心配 で たまら ない}。
          - 最近、株価 の 変動 が {不安 で たまら ない です}。
        english: Recently, the stock price fluctuations worry me immensely.
        hint: 「～でたまらない」 (can't stand it, overwhelmingly so) can be used with emotions like worry, indicating
          extreme distress. However, 「気になる」 implies the fluctuations are simply on your mind and difficult
          to ignore, not necessarily causing intense anxiety. We're looking for something that just persistently
          occupies your thoughts.
    scene: A businessman worrying about the market.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: cautious
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The expression 「気になって仕方がない」 (or 「しょうがない」/「仕方ありません」) emphasizes an uncontrollable sense of
      concern or an inability to stop thinking about something, indicating a persistent and involuntary
      preoccupation. This is a common phrase used when one cannot stop thinking or worrying about something.
      The semi-formal register is appropriate for a business context. The cautious setting reflects the
      inherent uncertainty of stock market fluctuations and the natural apprehension of someone whose
      investments are affected. The use of 「最近」 (recently) highlights that this is an ongoing, current
      state of concern, a continuous mental burden. This demonstrates how 「気になる」 can describe a strong,
      persistent, yet often unchosen mental state, where something weighs on one's mind consistently.
  - english: I can't help but wonder what that person is thinking.
    japanese:
      - あの 人 が 何 を 考え て いる の か {気 に なっ て} しょう が ない。
      - あの 人 が 何 を 考え て いる の か {気 に なっ て} 仕方 あり ませ ん。
      - あの 人 が 何 を 考え てる か、{気 に なっ ちゃっ て} さ。
    english_literally: What that person is thinking has become such a concern that I can't help it.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 人 が 何 を 考え て いる の か {知り たく て たまら ない}。
          - あの 人 が 何 を 考え て いる の か {謎 です}。
        english: I'm dying to know what that person is thinking.
        hint: 「知りたくてたまらない」 conveys an intense, almost unbearable desire to know. 「気になる」 expresses a persistent
          preoccupation or curiosity, but without the intense longing or urgency. We're looking for a
          general sense of something being on your mind and hard to ignore.
    scene: Wondering what a coworker thinks.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: Similar to 「仕方がない」, 「しょうがない」 expresses an uncontrollable feeling. The phrase 「気になってしょうがない」
      means one can't help but be interested or concerned, indicating a persistent, involuntary preoccupation.
      「仕方ありません」 is its polite counterpart. 「～ちゃってさ」 is a very casual, explanatory, slightly exasperated
      expression, typically used between close friends. The reflective setting emphasizes the internal
      nature of this curiosity, where the speaker is deeply pondering something. The example perfectly
      illustrates how someone's internal state (what they're thinking) can become a strong, persistent
      preoccupation for another person, demonstrating the broad applicability of 「気になる」 beyond just concrete
      objects or events. This is a common human experience, making the expression highly relatable.
  - english: I'm concerned about the weather tomorrow, but there's nothing I can do about it.
    japanese:
      - 明日 の 天気 が {気 に なる} けど、どう しよ う も ない。
      - 明日 の 天気 が {気 に なり ます} けど、どう しよ う も ない です ね。

        english: I'm worried about tomorrow's weather, but there's nothing I can do.
        hint: 「心配だ」 explicitly states a state of active worry. 「気になる」 indicates that the weather simply
          occupies your thoughts as a concern, a more passive state, without necessarily implying a strong
          emotional distress. We're looking for the weather being on your mind, even if you can't influence
          it.

      - 旅行 中 に 事故 に 遭わ ない か {気 に なっ て}、なかなか 眠れ なかっ た。
      - 旅行 中 に 事故 に 遭わ ない か {気 に なっ て}、ほとんど 眠れ ませ ん でし た。
      - 旅行 中 に 事故 に 遭わ ない か {気 に なっ ちゃっ て} さ、全然 眠れ なかっ た よ。
    english_literally: During the trip, whether I would encounter an accident became a concern, so I couldn't

          - 旅行 中 に 事故 に 遭わ ない か {心配 で}、なかなか 眠れ なかっ た。
          - 旅行 中 に 事故 に 遭わ ない か {不安 で}、なかなか 眠れ なかっ た。
        english: I was so worried about having an accident during the trip that I couldn't sleep.
        hint: 「心配で」 emphasizes an active state of intense worrying. 「気になって」 describes something occupying
          your thoughts as a concern, which then leads to sleeplessness, indicating a more passive, lingering
          preoccupation. We're looking for the sense of something just being on your mind and preventing
          sleep.
    scene: A person worried before a trip.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The te-form 「気になって」 again connects the concern to a resulting state, here, the inability to
      sleep. The sentence depicts a strong, persistent worry about 「事故 に 遭わ ない か」 (not having an accident),
      emphasizing a preoccupation that is hard to shake off. This casual context allows for expressions
      like 「～ちゃってさ」 (a colloquial contraction of 「～てしまって」), which adds a sense of exasperation or an unintended
      outcome. The cautious setting highlights the speaker's anxiety about potential negative events.
      This illustrates how 「気になる」 can describe a deep, involuntary concern that profoundly affects one's
      well-being, even leading to physical symptoms like insomnia. The nuance is that the worry 'came
      to be' and persisted, rather than being an actively chosen state of mind.
  - english: Recently, his health concerns me.
    japanese:
      - 最近、彼 の 健康 が {気 に なり ます}。
      - 最近、彼 の 健康 が {気 に なる} ん だ。
      - 最近、彼 の 健康 が {気 に なっ て い まし て}。
    english_literally: Recently, his health becomes a concern.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最近、彼 の 健康 が {心配 です}。
          - 最近、彼 の 健康 状態 に {懸念 が あり ます}。
        english: Recently, I am worried about his health.
        hint: 「心配です」 indicates an active state of worry, often implying a stronger emotional response.
          「気になります」 implies his health is simply on your mind or has drawn your attention as a concern,
          which is a less intense and more passive feeling. We're looking for something that just captures
          your attention and lingers in your thoughts.
    scene: A friend expressing polite concern for a mutual acquaintance's well-being.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: sympathetic
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: The use of the polite form 「気になります」 indicates a respectful and considerate tone when discussing
      a potentially sensitive topic like health. This register is appropriate when speaking to someone
      you respect but are not necessarily close to, or when expressing concern in a general, formal manner.
      「～るんだ」 is a casual explanatory form that softens the statement, while 「～ていまして」 is a more formal
      and humble way of expressing an ongoing state, often used in business or polite conversations. The
      sympathetic setting underscores the genuine, involuntary concern one feels for another's well-being.
      This demonstrates how 「気になる」 is suitable for expressing subtle, empathetic preoccupations without
      sounding overly intrusive or alarmist, making it ideal for delicate topics like health.
  - english: I don't care about what other people think at all.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 他人 の 目線 は 全然 {気 に なり ませ ん}。
      - 私 は 他人 の 目線 は 全然 {気 に なら ない}。
      - 他人 の 目線 なんて、まったく {気 に なら ない} よ。
    english_literally: I do not become concerned at all by other people's gazes.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 他人 の 目線 を 全然 {気 に し ませ ん}。
          - 私 は 他人 の 目線 なんて 全然 {気 に し ない}。
        english: I don't mind what other people think at all.
        hint: 「気にする」 implies an active, conscious decision to mind or care about something. 「気になる」 describes
          something spontaneously becoming a concern, but the negative here means it *doesn't* become
          a concern or enter one's thoughts. We're looking for the absence of something coming to your
          attention or lingering in your mind.
    scene: Someone confidently asserting their independence to a peer.
    register: formal
    setting: persuasive
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「全然 気 に なりません」 (or 「気にならない」 in plain form) strongly emphasizes a complete lack
      of concern, implying that the speaker is unaffected by 「他人 の 目線 」 (other people's gazes or opinions).
      This expression, while polite, can convey a strong sense of personal conviction and independence,
      often heard from younger individuals expressing their individuality and confidence. The use of 「まったく」
      (absolutely) further reinforces the negation. The persuasive setting suggests the speaker is trying
      to convince the listener (and perhaps themselves) of their steadfastness. The male speaker might
      use 「よ」 at the end for added assertion. This showcases how 「気になる」 can be used in the negative to
      express a state of being unbothered by something that might typically draw attention or cause worry
      for others, highlighting the speaker's self-assuredness.
post_example_writeup: When using 「が気になる」, remember that it expresses a spontaneous or involuntary feeling
  of interest or concern. It is less about a deliberate action and more about something drawing your attention
  or weighing on your mind. The particle 「が」 marks the subject of this feeling. Different conjugations
  allow expressing this feeling across various tenses and connecting it to other actions or states. Its
  strength lies in describing subtle, unchosen mental states, from mild curiosity to persistent preoccupation.
