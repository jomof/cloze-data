formation:
  な-adjective + すぎる: Indicates that the state described by the な-adjective is excessive or goes beyond
    an appropriate limit.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The verb 「過ぎる」(sugiru) fundamentally means "to pass," "to go beyond," or "to exceed." When
  attached to the stem of adjectives or verbs, it retains this core meaning of exceeding a limit or boundary,
  thus conveying "too much" or "excessive." This concept of "passing" a normal point leads to the nuance
  of an undesirable or out-of-bounds state.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「〜すぎる」 is attached to the stem of な-adjectives to indicate that a quality or state is present to an excessive, undesirable degree. This construction conveys a sense of "too much" or "overly" whatever the adjective describes, often implying a negative judgment or consequence. It's not simply stating a high degree, but rather that the degree is beyond what is considered appropriate or good.

  For example, if something is 「静かすぎる」(shizuka sugiru), it means it is "too quiet," implying perhaps that it's uncomfortably quiet, or eerily silent. It differs from simply 「とても静か」(totemo shizuka - very quiet), which is a neutral statement of degree. The nuance of 「〜すぎる」 often carries a subtle complaint, a sense of regret, or a warning about the negative implications of the excess.

  It can be used with a wide range of な-adjectives, and the resulting phrase functions like an い-adjective, meaning it can be conjugated for tense and politeness. For example, 「忙しすぎた」(isogashisugita) means "was too busy." Understanding the negative connotation is key to using 「〜すぎる」 correctly.
false_friends:
  - term: とても
    meaning: very
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とても」 simply emphasizes a high degree of something without implying any negative consequence
      or judgment. 「〜すぎる」, however, specifically means "too much" and almost always carries a negative
      connotation of being beyond an acceptable or desirable limit.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:とても (very)
  - term: 非常に
    meaning: extremely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「とても」, 「非常に」 expresses a very high degree but is more formal and lacks the negative
      nuance of 「〜すぎる」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:非常に (extremely)
  - term: すぎる
    meaning: too much; excessive
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This grammar point specifies な-adjective usage. The general 「すぎる」 applies the same "excessive"
      meaning to verbs and い-adjectives as well, but the conjugation rules differ.
    grammar_point: すぎる (too much・excessive)
  - term: い-Adjective[すぎる]
    meaning: excessive
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This has the same meaning of "excessive" but is used with い-adjectives, requiring a different
      conjugation rule (dropping the final い and adding すぎる). The current grammar point is specific to
      な-adjectives.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[すぎる] (excessive)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「〜すぎる」 and simple intensifiers like 「とても」 or 「非常に」,
  consider the underlying nuance you wish to convey. If you simply want to express a high degree of a
  quality, use 「とても」 or 「非常に」. However, if the high degree is problematic, undesirable, or exceeds an
  appropriate limit, then 「〜すぎる」 is the correct choice. For example, 「この部屋はとても静かです」 (This room is very
  quiet) is a neutral observation. But 「この部屋は静かすぎる」 (This room is too quiet) suggests an uncomfortable
  or eerie silence. Remember that 「〜すぎる」 itself is a general concept, and its application varies depending
  on the part of speech it modifies, such as with verbs or い-adjectives, which have different formation
  rules.
