pronunciation:
  katakana: ナアドジェクティブ スギル
  romaji: na-adjective sugiru
formation:
  な-Adjective (stem) + すぎる: Indicates that the quality described by the na-adjective is present to an
    excessive or undesirable degree.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: casual
  function: expresses that a quality or state is beyond an appropriate or desirable limit.
  nuance: Typically conveys a negative connotation, suggesting that the degree is problematic or creates
    an issue. It can sometimes be used neutrally or positively in informal contexts to emphasize a high
    degree.
  grammatical-role: modifies verbs or acts as a predicate itself.
etymology: The auxiliary suffix すぎる derives from the verb 過ぎる (sugiru), meaning 'to pass, to exceed, to
  go too far.' When appended to the stem form of na-adjectives, it retains this core meaning of 'exceeding
  a limit' or 'being too much,' implying that the quality expressed by the adjective has gone beyond a
  desirable or normal point. This direct link to its verb origin highlights the sense of 'overdoing' or
  'excess,' which often carries a negative implication.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point な-Adjective[すぎる] is used to express that a quality described by a な-adjective is present to an excessive degree. It is formed by taking the stem of a な-adjective and attaching すぎる. For example, from 綺麗 (kirei, 'beautiful' or 'clean'), you get 綺麗すぎる (kireisugiru, 'too beautiful' or 'too clean').

  While すぎる can sometimes be used neutrally or even positively in informal contexts to simply emphasize a very high degree, it most commonly carries a negative nuance. It implies that the excessiveness of the quality is undesirable, problematic, or a cause for concern. For instance, if something is 綺麗すぎる, it might mean it's 'too clean to be comfortable' or 'too beautiful to be approachable.'

  This structure can be conjugated like a normal る-verb (e.g., 綺麗すぎます, 綺麗すぎた, 綺麗すぎない). The negative connotation is inherent in the 'excessive' meaning, so use it carefully when describing things, as it might imply criticism or dissatisfaction.

  - term: とても な-Adjective
    meaning: very; extremely (na-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とても」 simply indicates a high degree without implying excessiveness or a negative connotation.
      For example, 「とても綺麗」 just means 'very beautiful,' whereas 「綺麗すぎる」 means 'too beautiful' (often with
      a hint of being excessive or even problematic).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:とても な-Adjective (very na-adjective)
  - term: あまり な-Adjective ない
    meaning: not very (na-adjective)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「あまり〜ない」 indicates a lack of degree or insufficient level of a quality. For example, 「あまり綺麗じゃない」
      means 'not very clean,' which is the opposite extreme from 'too clean.'
    grammar_point: あまり ない (not very or much)
  - term: Verb[すぎる]
    meaning: too much (verb)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This uses the same auxiliary verb すぎる but attaches to the masu-stem of verbs, indicating an
      excessive action. For example, 「食べすぎる」 means 'to eat too much.' While conceptually similar in expressing
      excess, it applies to actions, not qualities.
    grammar_point: すぎる (too much・excessive)
  - term: い-Adjective[すぎる]
    meaning: too (i-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to な-Adjective[すぎる], this form attaches すぎる to the stem of い-adjectives to indicate
      an excessive quality. For example, 「忙しすぎる」 means 'too busy.' The core concept of excessiveness is
      the same, but the grammatical attachment differs.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:い-Adjective[すぎる] (too i-adjective)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「な-Adjectiveすぎる」 specifically deals with an excessive degree of a na-adjective,
  understanding its relationship with other expressions of degree is crucial. Expressions like 「とても」 simply
  state a high level, whereas 「あまり〜ない」 denotes a low level. The auxiliary verb 「すぎる」 itself can also be
  attached to verbs or i-adjectives, maintaining its core meaning of 'excessive' but applying to different
  parts of speech. Pay attention to the part of speech it modifies to ensure correct usage and nuance.
examples:
  - english: This room is too quiet, it feels a bit eerie.
    japanese:
      - この 部屋 は 静か すぎ て、少し 不 気味 です。

          - この 部屋 は とても 静か で、少し 不 気味 です。
        english: This room is very quiet, and it feels a bit eerie.
        hint: 「とても」 just means 'very' and doesn't imply the quietness is excessive or problematic, which
          「静かすぎて」 does. We're looking for an excessive degree.
    scene: A student entering a vacant classroom.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The use of 「静かすぎて」 (shizuka sugite) indicates that the quietness is excessive to the point
      of being unsettling or 'eerie' (不気味). This highlights the common negative connotation of すぎる.

    japanese:

        english: His casualness is very casual, and he will be misunderstood by people.
        hint: 「とても」 indicates a high degree, but 「適当すぎて」 specifically conveys that his casualness is problematic
          and leads to misunderstandings. We're looking for a negative consequence of the quality.
    scene: Two friends discussing a mutual acquaintance.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The repetition of 「適当すぎ」 emphasizes the problematic nature of his overly casual attitude,
      leading to misunderstandings. The final 「よ」 adds a light emphasis to the statement.

    scene: Designers reviewing a new graphic.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: 「シンプルすぎて」 (shinpuru sugite) implies that the simplicity crosses into a negative realm, leading
      to a lack of impact, which is undesirable in design. This exemplifies the negative nuance of すぎる.
  - english: This topic is too complicated for me to explain clearly.
    japanese:
      - この 話 は 複雑 すぎ て、私 に は はっきり 説明 でき ない。
      - この 話 は 複雑 すぎ て、私 に は はっきり 説明 でき ない よ。

        hint: 「とても」 expresses a high degree, but 「複雑すぎて」 suggests the topic's complexity is beyond what's

          an obstacle.
    scene: A researcher struggling to simplify a complex concept for a general audience.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    conjugation: te-form (～て)

      showing a negative consequence of the excessive quality.

    competing_grammar:

        english: That store's customer service is sometimes very polite, and it makes me feel uncomfortable.
        hint: 「とても」 indicates a high level of politeness, but 「丁寧すぎて」 conveys that this politeness is
          excessive to the point of causing discomfort. We're looking for politeness that is *too much*.
    scene: Two friends chatting about shopping experiences.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「丁寧すぎて」 (teinei sugite) shows that the politeness is excessive to the point of causing discomfort
      (恐縮しちゃう). The particle 「わ」 (wa) is often used by female speakers to add a soft, empathetic, or emotional
      nuance.
  - english: The presentation materials were too flashy, making it hard to focus on the content.
    japanese:
      - プレゼン の 資料 が 派手 すぎ て、内容 に 集中 し にくかっ た です。
      - プレゼン の 資料 が 派手 すぎ て、内容 に 集中 し にくかっ た。

      the content.

  - english: This jacket is too constricting; I can't even close the zipper.
    japanese:
      - この ジャケット は 窮屈 すぎ て、チャック が 閉まら ない。
      - この ジャケット は 窮屈 すぎ て、チャック が 閉まり ませ ん。
    english_literally: This jacket is too constricting, the zipper won't close.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ジャケット は とても 窮屈 で、チャック が 閉まら ない。
        english: This jacket is very constricting, and the zipper won't close.
        hint: 「とても」 indicates a high degree of constricting, but 「窮屈すぎて」 highlights that it's excessively
          so, making it impossible to close the zipper. We're looking for a state that's too much to function.
    scene: Someone trying on clothes in a fitting room.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: Here, 「窮屈すぎて」 (kyūkutsu sugite) clearly indicates that the constricting feeling is excessive,
      preventing the zipper from closing. 「窮屈」 is a な-adjective.
    etymology: 窮屈 (kyūkutsu) derives from 窮 (kyū, meaning 'extremity' or 'distress') and 屈 (kutsu, meaning
      'to bend' or 'to yield'). It literally conveys a sense of being 'bent to an extreme,' leading to
      the meaning of being cramped, tight, or stifling, which fits the 'excessive' nuance of すぎる here
      in a physical sense.

        english: The story's ending was very dramatic, and it felt unrealistic.
        hint: 「とても」 means 'very,' but 「ドラマチックすぎて」 conveys that the drama was excessive to the point of

    scene: Friends discussing a movie or book.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: 「ドラマチックすぎて」 (doramachikku sugite) implies that the dramatic quality of the ending was overdone,
      making it feel unrealistic (現実味がない).

        english: His way of talking is very pessimistic, and everyone gets gloomy.
        hint: 「とても」 indicates a high level of pessimism, but 「悲観的すぎて」 implies this pessimism is excessive

    english_literally: This cafe is too lively, I cannot read my book.
    competing_grammar:

          - この カフェ は とても 賑やか で、本 が 読め ませ ん。
        english: This cafe is very lively, and I can't read my book.

    competing_grammar:

          - あなた の 計画 は とても 楽観 的 で、リスク を 考慮 し て い ない。
        english: Your plan is very optimistic, and it doesn't consider the risks.
        hint: 「とても」 means 'very,' but 「楽観的すぎる」 implies the optimism is excessive and problematic because
          it ignores risks. We're looking for a quality that is so strong it leads to a flaw.
    scene: A manager giving feedback on a project proposal.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「楽観的すぎる」 (rakkanteki sugiru) points to an excessive and undesirable level of optimism that
      hinders proper planning. This is a direct, critical assessment.

    japanese:

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 の 話 は とても ファンタスティック で、本当 だ と は 思え ませ ん。
        english: Her story was very fantastic, and I cannot think it is true.
        hint: 「とても」 simply indicates a high degree of fantastic, but 「ファンタスティックすぎて」 implies it's excessively
          fantastic to the point of being unbelievable. We're looking for a degree that challenges reality.
    scene: Friends discussing an unbelievable anecdote.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: 「ファンタスティックすぎて」 (fantasutikku sugite) implies that the story's fantastical nature was so extreme
      that it became unbelievable. This uses すぎる to express a quality that crosses a boundary into implausibility.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, な-Adjective[すぎる] consistently implies that the extent of
  a quality is undesirable or problematic, whether it's a physical state like being 'too constricting'
  or an abstract concept like being 'too optimistic.' The context often reveals the negative impact of
  this excessiveness.
