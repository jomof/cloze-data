    "etymology": "「おきに」 comes from the verb 「置く (おく)」 (to place, to put) and the particle 「に」. The nuance is placing something at an interval or leaving space between occurrences.",
    "writeup": "「おきに」 indicates that something happens at intervals. It's a combination of 「置き」, meaning \"opening\" or \"interval\", and the case-marking particle 「に」. It is primarily written in hiragana.\n\nThe difference between \"every\" and \"at intervals of\" can be tricky. Because 「おきに」 is a suffix, it attaches to numbers, counters, or spaces to highlight the interval.\n\n*   **Large time frames/distances:** Only 「ごとに」 expresses \"every\". It makes sense to ask \"at what point\" during a day, week, or month. Therefore, only 「おきに」 means \"after the interval of,\" while 「ごとに」 means \"every\".\n*   **Small time frames/distances:** Both 「ごとに」 and 「おきに」 can express \"every\". It's less common to ask \"at what point\" during seconds, minutes, or hours. Here, 「おきに」 points at the interval, meaning \"every interval of one second,\" because the exact timing within the interval is often assumed.\n\nIn short, 「おきに」 can mean \"every\" for short durations like seconds, minutes, or hours. But for larger durations, it usually means \"with spaces of\". Remember that 「おきに」 always highlights that (B) occurs after or outside of (A), while 「ごとに」 highlights (B) happening within (A).\n\n*   「一秒おきに」: The space is \"one second,\" so pointing to the next second assumes immediacy.\n*   「五年おきに」: The space is \"five years,\" so it's more natural to consider when (B) happens within that next year.\n\nIt's also worth noting that native speakers sometimes misuse these grammar points themselves. If unsure, think of 「おきに」 as \"leaving intervals of (A), (B)\" for most situations. An 「時間」 is about the upper limit of time that people disagree about.",
