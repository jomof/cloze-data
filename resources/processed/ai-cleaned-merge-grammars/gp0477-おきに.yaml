    "etymology": "「おきに」 comes from the verb 「置く (おく)」 (to place, to put) and the particle 「に」. The nuance is placing something at an interval or leaving space between occurrences.",
    "writeup": "「おきに」 indicates that something happens at intervals. It's a combination of 「置き」, meaning \"opening\" or \"interval\", and the case-marking particle 「に」. It is primarily written in hiragana.\n\nThe core concept of 「おきに」 is to highlight that an event (B) occurs after or outside of a specified interval (A). The distinction between whether it means \"every\" or \"at intervals of\" can be nuanced, often depending on the length of the interval:\n\n*   **For large time frames or distances (e.g., days, months, years, kilometers):** 「おきに」 generally means \"at intervals of\" or \"every other\". For example, 「二日おきに」 means \"every third day\" (after an interval of two full days). In contrast, 「ごとに」 would mean \"every\" (e.g., 「毎日」 or 「毎年」).\n\n*   **For small time frames or distances (e.g., seconds, minutes, centimeters):** Both 「ごとに」 and 「おきに」 can sometimes translate to \"every\", though their underlying nuance differs. When the interval is very short, the exact point within that interval often doesn't matter. So, 「一秒おきに」 often means \"every second\", because the 'space' between occurrences is effectively the entire second, and it's less common to distinguish where within that second something happens. This is because the focus remains on the *interval* itself being the primary unit.\n\nTo summarize: 「おきに」 consistently points to the occurrence of (B) *after* an interval of (A). For very short intervals, this effectively translates to \"every (A)\" because the concept of a precise point within that tiny interval becomes less relevant. For longer intervals, it clearly implies a gap.\n\nIt is important to understand the distinction from 「ごとに」, which emphasizes (B) happening *within* or *for each* unit of (A). For instance, 「一時間ごとに」 means something happens at some point during every hour, whereas 「一時間おきに」 emphasizes the occurrence after the hour interval has passed. There is sometimes a debate among native speakers regarding phrases like 「一時間おきに」, where some might interpret it as \"every hour\" while others as \"every two hours\", depending on their focus on the immediate next hour or the full interval. However, the consistent meaning of 「おきに」 always refers to the event happening after the specified interval. If unsure, think of 「おきに」 as \"leaving intervals of (A), then (B)\" for most contexts.\n\n**Fun Fact:** This grammatical nuance, particularly the distinction between 「おきに」 and 「ごとに」 for certain time frames, is a topic that even native speakers sometimes find tricky or debate among themselves. So, do not be discouraged if it takes time to grasp fully.\n",
