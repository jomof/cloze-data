    "etymology": "「おきに」 comes from the verb 「置く(おく)」 meaning \"to place\" or \"to put\", combined with the particle 「に」. The idea is that something is 'placed' or happens with a certain space or interval in between.",
    "writeup": "「おきに」 is generally written in kana (おきに). It combines the verb 「置く」 (oku), meaning \"to put\" or \"to place,\" with the case marking particle 「に」 (ni). It's used to express that something happens \"every (A)\" or \"at intervals of (A).\" The nuance can be tricky: sometimes it means \"every,\" and sometimes \"at intervals of.\" Let's clarify both cases.\n\nBecause 「おきに」 is a suffix, it attaches to numbers, counters, or whatever unit of \"space\" you're using to highlight the interval.\n\nThe best way to think of 「おきに」 is \"leaving a space of (A), (B).\" So, \"leaving a space of two days, (B)\" clarifies that something happens on the third day.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\n「ごとに」 and 「おきに」 are often confused. 「ごとに」 literally means \"every.\" 「おきに」 can also mean \"every\" sometimes, but because it has the core meaning of \"at intervals,\" it's more complex. Let's see when these overlap and when they differ.\n\n*   **Large time frames or distances:** Only 「ごとに」 expresses \"every.\" It makes sense to ask, \"at what point\" during a day, week, or month something occurs. Only 「おきに」 means \"after an interval of (A),\" while 「ごとに」 means \"every\".\n*   **Small time frames or distances:** Both 「ごとに」 and 「おきに」 can express \"every.\" It doesn't matter \"at what point\" during seconds, minutes, or hours something occurs. Here, 「おきに」 points to the interval, meaning \"every interval of one second,\" etc., because nobody asks, \"when did (B) happen during the next second?\" The space is just assumed to be \"one second\".\n\nIn summary:\n\n*   「おきに」 means \"every (A)\" for seconds, minutes, hours, millimeters, centimeters, and kilometers.\n*   「おきに」 means \"with spaces of\" for almost anything larger.\n\nThis isn't an exception, but a change of focus as spaces grow. 「おきに」 highlights that (B) occurs after or outside of (A), while 「ごとに」 highlights (B) happening within (A).\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   「一秒おきに」 (ichibyō oki ni): The space is \"one second.\" If 「おきに」 points to the next second's beginning, the space is still \"one second.\" Since 「おきに」 doesn't care when (B) happens within that next second, we assume it happens straight away.\n*   「五年おきに」 (gonen oki ni): The space is \"five years.\" If 「おきに」 points to the next year's beginning, the space becomes \"six years,\" because we'll want to know when (B) happens within that next year. Assuming someone waits for New Year of the sixth year to do something instantly would be strange.\n\n**Fun Fact:** Native speakers often misuse this, so don't worry if it's hard to grasp! If unsure, think of 「おきに」 as \"leaving intervals of (A), (B)\" for most situations.\n\n「一時間」 (ichijikan - one hour) is the upper time limit where people disagree if it means \"every hour\" or \"every second hour.\" The timeframe is short, yet long enough that opinions differ on whether the beginning of the hour or some point during the hour is the key information. Remember, 「おきに」 always points to the space's start after (A); it doesn't care when/where (B) happens afterward.",
