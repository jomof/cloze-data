meaning: gentle suggestion to try doing something
pronunciation:
  katakana: ゴラン
  romaji: goran
formation:
  Verb[て-form] + ごらん: Used to give a gentle suggestion or advice, implying 'try it and see'.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The phrase 『ごらん』 originates from 『ご覧になる』 (goran ni naru), which is the honorific form of 『見る』
  (miru - to see). Over time, when combined with the te-form of a verb, its meaning evolved from a respectful
  'please look at' or 'please see' to a gentler, less formal 'try doing (and see for yourself)' or 'why
  don't you try'. This evolution reflects a linguistic tendency for honorifics to sometimes generalize
  into more common usage, losing some of their original formality in specific contexts.
writeup: |-
  The grammatical pattern 『Verb[て-form] + ごらん』 is used to offer a gentle suggestion, advice, or instruction. It carries a nuance of encouraging someone to “try doing something and see what happens” or “why don’t you try (this action).” It is less direct and demanding than 『〜なさい』 (a polite but firm imperative) and generally softer than 『〜てください』 (a standard polite request).

  This expression is frequently employed by parents to children, teachers to students, or by someone in a more senior or experienced position addressing a less experienced individual. It implies that the speaker believes the action is beneficial or necessary for the listener to try and understand.

  While grammatically rooted in the honorific 『ご覧になる』, in this construction, 『ごらん』 itself does not convey honorific respect to the listener. Instead, it serves to soften the command, making it sound more like an invitation or a piece of helpful advice rather than a strict order. Therefore, it is important to understand the context and the relationship between the speakers when using or interpreting 『〜ごらん』.

  - term: '[Verb-stem]なさい'
    meaning: polite imperative
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『〜なさい』 is a direct command, often used by adults to children or in instructional settings.
      It can sound stern or authoritative, whereas 『〜ごらん』 is a softer, more encouraging suggestion.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]なさい (polite imperative)'
  - term: 〜てください
    meaning: please do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『〜てください』 is a general polite request that can be used in a wide range of situations. While
      polite, it is a straightforward request. 『〜ごらん』, conversely, implies a more personal suggestion
      or encouragement, often with an underlying message of 'experience it for yourself.'
    grammar_point: てください (polite request)
  - term: 〜てみる
    meaning: try doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『〜てみる』 means to 'try' an action, often to see the outcome or gain experience. It can be used
      by the speaker about themselves or to suggest to others. 『〜ごらん』 specifically functions as a gentle
      suggestion *to another person* to try something, explicitly inviting them to 'see' or experience
      the result.
    grammar_point: Verb[てみる] (try doing)
  - term: Verb[て]+みろ
    meaning: try doing (masculine, rough imperative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 『〜ごらん』 comes from 『ご覧になる』 (to see) and implies 'try and see', 『〜みろ』 is the plain imperative
      form of 『見る』 (to see) and sounds very rough and direct, often confrontational. It is a command to
      'look' or 'try', typically used by a male speaker to another male in a very casual or aggressive
      context, and lacks the gentleness of 『〜ごらん』.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て]みろ (rough imperative)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 『〜ごらん』 offers a gentle suggestion, be careful not to confuse it with
  more direct commands or simple requests. 『〜なさい』 is more authoritative, and 『〜てください』 is a neutral polite
  request. 『〜てみる』 focuses on the act of trying itself, rather than inviting someone else to try or observe.
  Remember, 『〜ごらん』 often implies 'try it and see for yourself,' which distinguishes it from these other
  expressions.
