meaning: Emphasis; Information Sharing (Sentence-ending particle)
pronunciation:
  katakana: ヨ
  romaji: yo
formation:
  '[Sentence] + よ': Adds emphasis or conveys new information.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: casual
  particle-syntactic-function: sentence-final
  particle-pragmatic-function: emphasis
  usage-context: Primarily used in informal or casual settings to convey new information, assert an opinion,
    or give a strong suggestion. Often used in spoken language and can carry emotional resonance.
  function: To add emphasis, inform the listener of new information, or assert the speaker's opinion or
    decision. It effectively indicates the speaker's certainty about a fact or their belief that the information
    is new to the listener.
  nuance: Carries a sense of informing, asserting, or drawing the listener's attention to something the
    speaker considers important or new to them. Can sometimes imply a slight presumption that the listener
    is unaware of the information. When combined with ね, it can seek empathy or agreement, deepening the
    interaction between speaker and listener.
  counterpoint: Often contrasted with ね, which seeks confirmation or agreement. よ is more declarative,
    ね is more inquisitive/inclusive.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a sentence-final particle, modifying the entire utterance.
  logical-flow: Introduces or confirms information with a sense of certainty or strong conviction from
    the speaker's perspective.
  temporal-flow: No specific temporal implication, functions with various tenses.
  spatial-flow: No specific spatial implication, functions in various spatial contexts.
etymology: 'The origins of よ are not definitively known, but it''s believed to have evolved from older
  forms of Japanese sentence-ending particles. Its function has remained consistent over time: to add
  emphasis or assert information. It''s a very fundamental particle, reflecting its long history in the
  language.'
writeup: よ is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese, primarily used to convey new information to the
  listener or to add emphasis. It is typically affixed to the end of a sentence. While its primary function
  is to inform, よ is frequently combined with ね to seek agreement or confirmation, such as in 「〜ですよね」,
  which conveys a sense of "I think (A), and I expect you agree (A)." It is crucial to remember that the
  copula だ precedes よ when attached to nouns or な-adjectives in plain form, a rule consistent with general
  Japanese conjugation, not unique to よ. Furthermore, ですよ can be used with all parts of speech to maintain
  politeness. It is particularly effective when indicating the speaker's certainty about a particular
  fact or situation, or the recognition that the information is new to the listener. Its use can deepen
  the interaction between the speaker and the listener, as it serves not just to transmit information,
  but also to invite engagement or agreement.
false_friends:
  - term: ね
    meaning: Confirmation seeking (sentence-ending particle)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike よ, ね is used to seek confirmation or agreement, or to soften a statement, rather than
      to primarily introduce new information or assert one's opinion.
    grammar_point: ね (seeking agreement)
  - term: ぞ
    meaning: Strong emphasis (primarily used by men)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike よ, ぞ conveys a very strong, often forceful, emphasis or assertion, almost like a warning
      or a strong command, and is predominantly used by men. It carries a more confrontational or determined
      tone.
    grammar_point: ぞ (strong emphasis)
  - term: さ
    meaning: Casual emphasis
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While よ informs or emphasizes new information, さ is used for lighter, more general emphasis,
      often to draw the listener's attention in a casual way, or sometimes as a filler. It lacks the strong
      informative or assertive quality of よ.
    grammar_point: さ (casual emphasis)
  - term: ぜ
    meaning: Male emphatic particle
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ぜ is an even stronger and more masculine emphatic particle than ぞ or よ. It often implies a
      confident, sometimes challenging, or very assertive declaration, mostly used among close male friends
      or in very casual, direct speech.
    grammar_point: ぜ (male emphatic particle)
post_false_friends_writeup: While よ, ね, ぞ, さ, and ぜ are all sentence-ending particles, their nuances differ
  significantly. よ is primarily for conveying new information or assertive emphasis. ね seeks confirmation
  or softens a statement. ぞ and ぜ are used for strong, masculine emphasis, with ぜ being more assertive
  than ぞ. さ offers a lighter, more general emphasis or acts as a casual filler.

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 'よ' can be appended to various sentence structures (plain
  forms, polite forms, sentences ending in だ/です, and combinations with ん/の) to convey new information,
  assert an opinion, or give a strong suggestion. Its placement at the end of the sentence consistently
  highlights the speaker's emphasis on the preceding statement, inviting the listener's attention or acknowledgment.
