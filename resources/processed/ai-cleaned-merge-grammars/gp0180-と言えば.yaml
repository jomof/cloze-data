It's similar to saying \"speaking of...\" in English. It indicates that the speaker is reminded of something or wants to shift the conversation to a connected topic, often triggered by the previous speaker's words.

The other expressions each carry a different emotional tone, a specific purpose (like explanation or contradiction), or a higher degree of informality, and thus are not interchangeable with 「と言えば」 for simple topic transitions.",
