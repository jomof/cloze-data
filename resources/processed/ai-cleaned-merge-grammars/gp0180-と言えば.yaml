    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Used to bring up a related topic or something that you recall upon hearing a particular word or phrase. It can express a casual connection or a spontaneous thought triggered by the previous statement.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the speaker is reminded of something or wants to switch the topic to something related."
    },
    "etymology": "「と言う (to iu)」 meaning \"to say\" and 「ば (ba)」, the conditional particle. Literally, it means \"if you say,\" indicating that the topic is being introduced based on what was just mentioned.",
    "writeup": "「と言えば (to ieba)」 literally means \"if you say that...\" but functions as an expression to introduce a topic related to what was just mentioned. It's similar to saying \"speaking of...\" in English. It indicates that the speaker is reminded of something or wants to shift the conversation to a connected topic, often triggered by the previous speaker's words. This phrase is typically used in conversational settings, allowing for a smooth and natural transition between subjects.",

The other expressions each carry a different emotional tone, a specific purpose (like explanation or contradiction), or a higher degree of informality, and thus are not interchangeable with 「と言えば」 for simple topic transitions.",
