    "writeup": "「と言えば (to ieba)」 literally means \"if you say that...\" but functions as an expression to introduce a topic related to what was just mentioned. It's similar to saying \"speaking of...\" in English. It indicates that the speaker is reminded of something or wants to shift the conversation to a connected topic, often triggered by the previous speaker's words. This phrase is typically used in conversational settings, allowing for a smooth and natural transition between subjects.",

It is a neutral and common conversational bridge. The other expressions each carry a different emotional tone, a specific purpose (like explanation or contradiction), or a higher degree of informality, and thus are not interchangeable with 「と言えば」 for simple topic transitions.",
