    "meaning": "On the contrary; rather; instead",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Generally used in formal and informal settings.",
        "Nuance": "Expresses a result that is the opposite of what one would expect or hope for. It implies a sense of disappointment or irony due to the unexpected outcome.",
        "Usage": "Used to describe situations where the outcome is contrary to what was intended or expected. It often carries a negative connotation."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「かえって」 originally comes from the verb 「返る(かえる)」 which means \"to return\" or \"to revert.\" Over time, it evolved to mean \"contrary to expectation\" or \"instead,\" indicating a reversal of the expected outcome.",
    "writeup": "「かえって」 is used to express that the result of an action or situation is the opposite of what was expected. It carries a nuance of disappointment or irony, highlighting the unexpected and often undesirable outcome. It's similar to saying \"on the contrary,\" \"rather,\" or \"instead\" in English, but with a stronger sense of surprise at the reversed result. The grammar point is an adverb, so it is located before the part it modifies.",
