        "Register": "Generally used in formal and informal settings.",
        "Nuance": "Expresses a result that is the opposite of what one would expect or hope for. It implies a sense of disappointment or irony due to the unexpected outcome.",
        "Usage": "Used to describe situations where the outcome is contrary to what was intended or expected. It often carries a negative connotation."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「かえって」 originally comes from the verb 「返る(かえる)」 which means \"to return\" or \"to revert.\" Over time, it evolved to mean \"contrary to expectation\" or \"instead,\" indicating a reversal of the expected outcome.",
    "writeup": "「かえって」 is used to express that the result of an action or situation is the opposite of what was expected. It carries a nuance of disappointment or irony, highlighting the unexpected and often undesirable outcome. It's similar to saying \"on the contrary,\" \"rather,\" or \"instead\" in English, but with a stronger sense of surprise at the reversed result. The grammar point is an adverb, so it is located before the part it modifies.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「むしろ」 and 「かえって」 can both translate to \"rather\" or \"instead,\" their nuances differ significantly. 「むしろ」 is used to indicate a preference or correction, while 「かえって」 expresses an unexpected and often undesirable reversal of the expected outcome. Similarly, 「やはり」 indicates confirmation of an expectation, which is the opposite of the surprise conveyed by 「かえって」.",
