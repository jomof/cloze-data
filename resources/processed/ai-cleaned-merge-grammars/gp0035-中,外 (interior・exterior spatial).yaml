    "etymology": "The kanji 中 (naka) originally depicted an arrow piercing the center of a target, symbolizing 'middle' or 'interior.' The kanji 外 (soto) is believed to have evolved from a pictograph of a person standing outside a gate, representing 'outside' or 'exterior.' Their roles as spatial indicators are deeply rooted in these ancient visual representations.",
    "writeup": "The Japanese words **中 (naka)** and **外 (soto)** are fundamental for expressing spatial relationships. **中 (naka)** primarily means \"inside\" or \"middle,\" and it can be used for both physical spaces and more abstract concepts like being \"in the middle of\" an action or a period of time. For example, 「箱 の 中」 means \"inside the box,\" while 「食事 中」 means \"during a meal\" or \"in the middle of eating.\"\n\n**外 (soto)** means \"outside\" or \"exterior.\" It is generally used for physical spaces outside of something. For instance, 「家 の 外」 means \"outside the house.\"\n\nIt's important to pay attention to how **中** is used with verbs. When attached to the **dictionary form of a verb**, it signifies that an action is currently in progress, similar to the English \"-ing\" form. For example, 「走る 中」 would mean \"while running\" or \"in the middle of running.\" When **中** follows a noun, it often denotes a state of being *during* a particular period or event, such as 「会議 中」 (\"during the meeting\").\n\nThe usage of **中 (naka)** can be quite versatile, extending beyond simple physical location to encompass temporal states and abstract contexts. Understanding the core meaning of \"middle\" or \"interior\" helps connect these various uses.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing between **中 (naka)** and **うち (uchi)**, remember that **うち (uchi)** often carries a sense of belonging or being part of one's own sphere, whereas **中 (naka)** is more neutral and simply refers to the interior space. For instance, you would say 「家 の 中」 for 'inside the house' in general, but 「うち の 中」 if you mean 'inside *my* house' with a sense of personal connection. As for **間 (aida)**, think of it as the space *between* things or the *duration* of an event, while **中 (naka)** is more about being *within* something or *in the midst* of an action. Regarding **以内 (inai)** and **以外 (igai)**, these particles delineate *boundaries* or *exclusions*. **以内 (inai)** specifies being *within a defined limit or range*, often relating to time, quantity, or scope, whereas **中 (naka)** denotes a more general 'inside' or 'during' an ongoing state. Conversely, **以外 (igai)** indicates 'everything but' a specified item or category, functioning to *exclude*, while **外 (soto)** simply means 'outside' a physical boundary.",
