It emphasizes the universality or complete absence of exceptions regarding a particular state or action.",
    "writeup": "「Noun[negative-modifier]・Verb[ない]・Adjective[negative] + はない」 is a grammatical construction that uses a double negative to emphasize a positive statement. It's similar to saying \"There isn't anything that doesn't...\" in English, implying \"everything does...\" or \"everyone is...\". This pattern is used to express that something is universally true or that there are no exceptions. Pay close attention to what type of word is being negated (a noun modified by a negative clause, a verb in its negative form, or an adjective in its negative form) to properly use and interpret the phrase. This term is **not** to be confused with 「なくはない」, a more advanced grammar pattern which means \"It's not that it isn't (A).\"",
