    "writeup": "「Noun[negative-modifier]・Verb[ない]・Adjective[negative] + はない」 is a grammatical construction that uses a double negative to emphasize a positive statement. It's similar to saying \"There isn't anything that doesn't...\" in English. This pattern is used to express that something is universally true or that there are no exceptions. Pay close attention to what type of word is being negated (noun, verb, or adjective) to properly use and interpret the phrase. This term is **not** to be confused with 「なくはない」, a more advanced grammar pattern which means \"It's not that it isn't (A).\".",
