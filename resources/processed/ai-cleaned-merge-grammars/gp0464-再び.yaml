        "Adverbial Usage": "[再び] + Verb/Verb Phrase: Placed before a verb or verb phrase to indicate a repetition of an action."
    },
    "jlpt": "N3",
    "meaning": "Again, once more, a second time.",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used to indicate an action or state occurring a second time, often after a significant interval or interruption.",
        "function": "Modifies verbs or verb phrases to denote recurrence.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes that something is happening for a second time, rather than continuous or frequent repetition. It carries a more formal or literary tone compared to 'また'.",
        "source": "Bunpro",
        "counterpoint": "While 'また' is a general term for 'again', '再び' specifically implies 'a second time' and is more formal.",
        "colocation": "Typically precedes the verb or verb phrase it modifies.",
        "grammatical-role": "Adverbial modifier.",
        "logical-flow": "Indicates a re-initiation of an action or state.",
        "temporal-flow": "Denotes a past action or state being repeated in the present or future."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「再び」 is derived from 「二度 (にど)」, meaning \"twice\" or \"a second time,\" with the 「び」 acting as a suffix indicating frequency or repetition. Over time, 「再び」 evolved to specifically denote something happening for the second time.",
    "writeup": "「再び」 is an adverb that means \"to repeat\". It is typically translated as \"again,\" \"once more,\" or \"a second time.\" While it often appears at the beginning of a sentence, it can also be placed before the verb or clause it modifies.Despite meaning \"to repeat,\" 「再び」 has the nuance of repeating something specifically \"for the second time.\" Because of this, it is not used to highlight things that need to be repeated over and over again.Unlike 「また」, which is frequently used to express \"again,\" 「再び」 is quite formal and is more often seen in books or articles than in casual spoken language.",
