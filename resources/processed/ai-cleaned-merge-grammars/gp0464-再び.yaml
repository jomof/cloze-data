    "etymology": "再び (futatabi) is derived from the verb 重ねる (kasaneru), meaning 'to pile up' or 'to repeat'. The 'futa' part comes from 二つ (futatsu), meaning 'two', indicating the sense of doing something a second time. The 'bi' ending is related to the adverbial form.",
    "writeup": "**再び** (futatabi) is an adverb that means \"to repeat.\" It is regularly translated as \"again,\" \"once more,\" or \"a second time.\" Usually, **再び** will appear at the beginning of a sentence, before some sort of request or statement is made about what needs to be repeated.\n\nDespite meaning \"to repeat,\" **再び** specifically has the nuance of repeating something \"for the second time.\" Because of this, it should not be used to highlight things that need to be repeated over and over again.\n\n**Important Considerations**\nUnlike **また**, which is frequently used to express \"again,\" **再び** is quite formal and will be seen far more often in books and articles than it will be spoken.",
