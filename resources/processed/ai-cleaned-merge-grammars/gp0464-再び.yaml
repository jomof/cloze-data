    "etymology": "The term 「再び」 is derived from 「二度 (にど)」, meaning \"twice\" or \"a second time,\" with the 「び」 acting as a suffix indicating frequency or repetition. Over time, 「再び」 evolved to specifically denote something happening for the second time.",
    "writeup": "「再び」 is an adverb that means \"to repeat\". It is typically translated as \"again,\" \"once more,\" or \"a second time.\" While it often appears at the beginning of a sentence, it can also be placed before the verb or clause it modifies.\n\nDespite meaning \"to repeat,\" 「再び」 has the nuance of repeating something specifically \"for the second time.\" Because of this, it is not used to highlight things that need to be repeated over and over again.\n\n**Important Consideration:** Unlike 「また」, which is frequently used to express \"again,\" 「再び」 is quite formal and is more often seen in books or articles than in casual spoken language.",
