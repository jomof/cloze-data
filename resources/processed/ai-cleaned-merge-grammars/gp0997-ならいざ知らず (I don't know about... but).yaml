    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ならいざ知らず」 combines the hypothetical form of the auxiliary verb 「だ」 (nara), the adverb 「いざ」 (iza) meaning 'now' or 'well then', and the classically-negated form of the verb 「知る」 (shiru), 「知らず」 (shirazu) meaning 'to not know'.",
    "writeup": "「ならいざ知らず」 is a complex expression combining the hypothetical form 「なら」, the adverb 「いざ」, and the negated form 「知らず」. It is often translated as “I don’t know about (A), but (B)” or “maybe (A), but (B).” This phrase is often considered formal or semi-formal and typically used to emphasize that, regardless of situation (A), situation (B) is definitely the case or fits a specific description. It follows verbs in their dictionary forms, as well as な-adjectives or nouns where their terminal 「だ」 is replaced with 「なら」. It can also follow nominalized い-adjectives using 「の」, though this is less common with verbs. This structure highlights that while (A) may or may not be the case or is an extreme example, (B) is a definite or more common reality. The contrast between (A) being unknown or less significant and (B) being definite is key to its meaning. In many instances, (A) is an extreme or unlikely example, used to set up (B) as a more surprising or irritating counterpoint. While not directly translating to 'but', the contrasting meaning arises from the assertion of (B) in light of the uncertainty of (A). Occasionally, 「は」 may be used instead of 「なら」 (e.g., 「〜はいざ知らず」), but the overall meaning of the phrase remains the same, maintaining the emphasis on the contrast.",
