    "etymology": "The particle 「さえ」 is believed to have originated from the verb 「添う(そう)」, meaning \"to accompany\" or \"to add to\". Over time, it evolved to express the idea of something being added or included, eventually taking on the meaning of \"even\" or \"only\".",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle 「さえ」 is used to emphasize something exists in a certain state. It's often translated as \"even\". It indicates that something is an extreme example, a minimum requirement, or an addition to a pre-existing condition.\n\n「さえ」 is frequently paired with other particles, and it is often followed by verbs in the negative form. The overall meaning is usually determined by what part (B) of the sentence is conveying.\n\nHere's how 「さえ」 relates to other adverbial particles: 「は」, 「も」, and 「でも」:\n\n*   「は」: (A) is completely expected, nothing unusual.\n*   「も」: (A) is included as part of what's expected, but can be unusual.\n*   「でも」: (A) may or may not be included as part of what's expected, and can be unusual.\n*   「さえ」: (A) is separated completely from what's expected and is unusual. Often translated as \"let alone (A)\" or \"not to mention (A)\".",
