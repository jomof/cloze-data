    "etymology": "The particle 「さえ」 is believed to have originated from the verb 「添う(そう)」, meaning \"to add\" or \"to accompany.\" This etymology aligns with one of 「さえ」's primary functions: to add emphasis by indicating that if something unexpected is true, then it logically follows that more ordinary things are true as well.",
    "writeup": "「さえ」 is an adverbial particle used to emphasize the extreme nature of something. It often translates to \"even,\" \"if only,\" or \"as long as.\" 「さえ」 highlights that if something unexpected or unlikely is true, then it naturally follows that more ordinary things are true as well.\n\n「さえ」 can express several related ideas:\n\n*   **Analogical Reasoning (類推):** Indicating that something is an outstanding example.\n*   **Limit (限定):** Suggesting that something is *all* that is needed.\n*   **Addition (添加):** Implying that something compounds a pre-existing state.\n\n「さえ」 is frequently paired with other particles and followed by verbs in the negative form, with the meaning usually determined by the surrounding context. It functions to single out an item as an extreme case, implying that if even this item is true, then everything else is also true.",
