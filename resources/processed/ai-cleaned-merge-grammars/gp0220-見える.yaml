    "meaning": "To be visible, to seem, to be in sight.",
    "meaning_warning": "見える was originally a conjugation of 見る, but nowadays we treat it as a standalone intransitive verb. It is also used in honorific speech, meaning “to come.”",
    "formation": {
        "[Subject が] + 見える": "Indicates that something is visible or can be seen.",
        "[Object に] + [Subject が] + 見える": "Indicates how something appears to someone (it seems or looks a certain way).",

    "etymology": "見える is derived from the verb 見る (miru), meaning \"to see.\" Over time, it evolved into an intransitive verb, indicating that something is visible without active intention.",
    "writeup": "In much the same way that 聞こえる is used to describe things that are \"audible,\" 見える can be used to describe things that are \"visible.\" 見える itself is an intransitive verb, meaning that the object that is \"visible\" will be marked with が. When using 見える, (A) will always be followed by が.\n\nHowever, the 'way that something looks' will be marked adverbially. This means that an い-Adjective will be changed to its く form, and な-Adjectives/nouns will be followed by に.\n\nThe primary difference between 見える and 見られる (the potential form of 見る), is that 見える is used to identify things that do not require the active concentration of the spectator to be seen. In other words, seeing it is unavoidable (if looking in its direction of course). However, 見られる is used when the onlooker is trying to concentrate on some specific object, and is referring to their \"ability\" to see it.\n\n見える is also sometimes used to describe the \"sense\" of sight, and refers to whether anything is visible at all for the speaker.",
