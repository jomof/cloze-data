    "etymology": "見える is derived from the verb 見る (miru), meaning \"to see.\" Over time, it evolved into an intransitive verb, indicating that something is visible without active intention. It also gained a usage to describe appearance or seeming.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 見える (mieru) is an intransitive verb used to describe something that is **visible** or **can be seen spontaneously** without conscious effort. It inherently expresses a state of being seen, much like 聞こえる (kikoeru) expresses a state of being audible.\n\nWhen using 見える to describe something that is visible, the object that is seen is typically marked with the particle が. For instance, 「富士山 が 見える」 (Fuji-san ga mieru) means \"Mount Fuji is visible\" or \"Mount Fuji can be seen.\"\n\n見える can also be used to describe **how something appears or looks**. In this case, it is often preceded by an adverbial modifier. For example, an い-adjective will change to its く-form (e.g., 小さい → 小さく), and a な-adjective or noun will be followed by に (e.g., きれいな → きれいに, 学生 → 学生に). For instance, 「小さく 見える」 (chiisaku mieru) means \"it looks small,\" and 「学生に 見える」 (gakusei ni mieru) means \"he/she looks like a student.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nThe primary distinction between 見える and 見られる (mirareru), the potential form of 見る (miru), lies in the **intentionality of seeing**. \n\n*   **見える** implies that something simply comes into your field of vision, often without active concentration. It's about what is *unavoidably visible* if you are in the right position.\n*   **見られる** on the other hand, implies the *ability* to see something, often requiring effort, focus, or specific conditions to be met. For example, if you are looking for a rare bird, you might say 「鳥 が 見られる」 (tori ga mirareru) meaning \"I can see the bird\" (implying you successfully spotted it).\n\nAdditionally, 見える can refer to the **sense of sight itself**, indicating whether a person has the faculty of vision or not. For example, 「目 が 見えない」 (me ga mienai) means \"cannot see\" or \"is blind.\"\n\nWhile 見える was historically a potential form of 見る, it has evolved into a distinct intransitive verb in modern Japanese, focusing on the state of visibility rather than the action of seeing.",
