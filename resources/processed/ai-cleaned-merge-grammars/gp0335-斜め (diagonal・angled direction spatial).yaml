        "usage-context": "Used to describe objects or directions that are not horizontal or vertical, but at an angle. Can refer to physical alignment or a direction.",

    },
    "etymology": "The term 「斜め」 (naname) comes from the kanji 「斜」 (sha, nana-me), which means 'slant' or 'inclination'. The doubling of 'naname' itself creates a more descriptive, visual quality, emphasizing the 'slanting' or 'diagonal' nature. It paints a picture of something specifically angled, rather than just 'not straight' or 'crooked'. Its origin highlights the visual characteristic of being neither perfectly horizontal nor vertical.",
    "writeup": "「斜め」 is a versatile word in Japanese used to describe anything that is *diagonal*, *slanted*, or *at an angle*. It can refer to physical objects, lines, directions, or even abstract concepts like a 'slant' in one's mood (though less common in basic usage). When used as a な-adjective, it directly modifies a noun, as in 「斜めな線」 (a diagonal line). When modifying a verb, it often takes the particle 「に」, for example, 「斜めに切る」 (to cut diagonally). It can also function as a noun itself, as in 「斜めから見る」 (to look from a diagonal angle). It is a fundamental term for spatial description in Japanese.",

            "meaning": "bent, curved, crooked",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「斜め」 describes a straight line or direction at an angle, 「曲がっている」 implies a curve or an irregular, non-straight shape. Something 「斜め」 is intentionally or structurally angled, while something 「曲がっている」 is often unintentionally or naturally curved or bent."

            "meaning": "tilted, leaning",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「傾いている」 specifically describes something that is *tilted* or *leaning* from its usual upright or level position, often implying instability or a temporary state. 「斜め」 refers to something being diagonal or angled as its inherent form or direction, without necessarily implying a tilt or lean from a standard position. For example, a diagonal line is 「斜め」, but a tower might be 「傾いている」."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When describing spatial orientation, it's easy to confuse 「斜め」 with words like 「曲がっている」 or 「傾いている」. Remember that 「斜め」 is about a clear, straight angle, like a diagonal line. 「曲がっている」 is for things that are curved or bent. 「傾いている」 is for things that are tilted or leaning, often from an upright position. Understanding these subtle differences will help you describe situations more accurately.",
