    "etymology": "The term 「斜め」 (naname) comes from the kanji 「斜」 (sha, nana-me), which means 'slant' or 'inclination'. The doubling of 'naname' itself creates a more descriptive, visual quality, emphasizing the 'slanting' or 'diagonal' nature. It paints a picture of something specifically angled, rather than just 'not straight' or 'crooked'. Its origin highlights the visual characteristic of being neither perfectly horizontal nor vertical.",
    "writeup": "「斜め」 is a versatile word in Japanese used to describe anything that is **diagonal**, **slanted**, or **at an angle**. It can refer to physical objects, lines, directions, or even abstract concepts like a 'slant' in one's mood (though less common in basic usage). When used as a な-adjective, it directly modifies a noun, as in 「斜めな線」 (a diagonal line). When modifying a verb, it often takes the particle 「に」, for example, 「斜めに切る」 (to cut diagonally). It can also function as a noun itself, as in 「斜めから見る」 (to look from a diagonal angle). It is a fundamental term for spatial description in Japanese.",

            "nuance": "「傾いている」 specifically describes something that is *tilted* or *leaning* from its usual upright or level position, often implying instability or a temporary state. 「斜め」 refers to something being diagonal or angled as its inherent form or direction, without necessarily implying a tilt or lean from a standard position. For example, a diagonal line is 「斜め」, but a tower might be 「傾いている」.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When describing spatial orientation, it's easy to confuse 「斜め」 with words like 「曲がっている」 or 「傾いている」. Remember that 「斜め」 is about a clear, straight angle, like a diagonal line. 「曲がっている」 is for things that are curved or bent. 「傾いている」 is for things that are tilted or leaning, often from an upright position.
