    "etymology": "The grammar point 「Verb[volitional-よう] + と + する (suru)」 means 'to try to do'. By negating 「する」, we get 「しない」, creating the meaning 'to not try to do' or 'to be unwilling to do'.",
    "writeup": "The 「Verb[volitional-よう] + としない」 grammar point expresses a **lack of willingness or effort** to do something. It's similar to saying \"not willing to\" or \"not making an effort to\".\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This expression often carries a **negative connotation**, as it implies a deliberate choice not to act.\n*   It's generally used to describe **other people's actions** rather than your own. Using it to describe yourself can sound abrupt or rude. In such cases, consider using 「ようと思わない」 instead, which means \"I don't think I will do (A)\" or \"I have no intention of doing (A)\".",
