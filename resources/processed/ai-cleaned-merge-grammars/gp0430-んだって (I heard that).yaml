formation:
  '[Sentence] + んだって': Indicates that the speaker heard something (casual).
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used among close friends/equals
etymology: The grammar point 「んだって」 is a combination of 「ん」 (a shortened form of 「の」 used to provide explanation),
  「だ」 (the copula 'to be,' indicating assertion), and 「って」 (a colloquial abbreviation of 「と言って」, meaning
  'said'). Thus, it literally translates to 'it is that (A) was said'.
writeup: 「んだって」 is used at the end of sentences to express information the speaker has heard from someone
  else. It's a casual way of saying "I heard that..." or "Someone said that...". Because 「んだって」 is quite
  casual, it's best used in conversations with friends or people you're close to. It is often used in
  informal conversation to pass along information without necessarily vouching for its accuracy.
false_friends:
  - term: と聞いた
    meaning: I heard that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「んだって」, 「と聞いた」 is a more formal phrase suitable for wider social contexts, often implying
      a more direct or reliable source.
    grammar_point: ときいた (I heard that)
  - term: って (quotation)
    meaning: Casual quotation
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「って」 indicates reported speech, it is usually a direct or near-direct quote, whereas
      「んだって」 is used for more general hearsay or simply relaying information.
    grammar_point: って (quotation)
  - term: とか
    meaning: I heard that… something like, They said ... or something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とか」 conveys uncertainty or lists possibilities with a vague or dismissive nuance. In contrast,
      「んだって」 directly reports something heard.
    grammar_point: とか (hearsay)
  - term: らしい (I hear, it seems)
    meaning: Seems like; Apparently; I heard
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「らしい」 implies the speaker's deduction from evidence, not direct hearsay. 「んだって」, on the other
      hand, specifically reports information that was heard.
    grammar_point: らしい (I hear, it seems)
  - term: そうだ (hear that)
    meaning: I heard that, It is said that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「そうだ」 (hearsay) often carries a higher degree of confidence than 「んだって」, or it can describe
      direct sensory observation ('it looks like').
    grammar_point: そうだ (hear that)
  - term: だって (casual reason・hearsay・even)
    meaning: Because, But, Even or also, Even if or even though
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「だって」 has various uses, such as 'because' or 'but', and often serves as a conversational filler
      or mild protest. 「んだって」, however, specifically reports hearsay, combining the explanatory 「ん」 with
      「だって」.
    grammar_point: だって (casual reason・hearsay・even)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「んだって」 is primarily used for relaying information
  you've heard, emphasizing the source is external to yourself. When you want to express your own reasoning
  or use a more formal expression, consider alternatives like 「から」, 「と聞いた」, or 「そうだ」.
