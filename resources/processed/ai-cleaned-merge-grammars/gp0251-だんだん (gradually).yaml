        "grammatical-role": "adverb"
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「だんだん」 originally comes from the kanji construction 「段々」, which literally means 「step by step」 or 「stage by stage」. The repetition emphasizes the gradual nature of the change, evoking the image of ascending or descending steps. This core concept of sequential, continuous movement or change is fundamental to its usage.",
    "writeup": "「だんだん」 is an adverb used to express a slight but constant progression of something. It signifies a change that occurs \"step by step\" or \" steadily,\" often implying a natural, continuous process rather than a series of distinct increments. This adverb modifies the meaning of entire phrases, indicating a gradual increase or decrease in a state or action. To use 「だんだん」, simply place it before the phrase that describes the change. While 「だんだん」 can optionally take the particle 「と」 (e.g., だんだんと), it is very often omitted, a common characteristic for many adverbs and onomatopoeic words in Japanese. It is important to distinguish 「だんだん」 from 「どんどん」. While both describe progression, 「どんどん」 implies a rapid or forceful change, often carrying the nuance of a banging sound (like a drum). In contrast, 「だんだん」 emphasizes a slower, more deliberate, and continuous progression. Similarly, while 「少しずつ」 also means \"little by little,\" it tends to imply discrete, incremental steps or changes that are more consciously measured, whereas 「だんだん」 suggests a more flowing, unfolding process.",

            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「だんだん」, 「どんどん」 expresses fast changes or progression. It has the onomatopoeic feel of drums, implying force or speed, or a rapid, unhesitating action.",

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The primary differences among 「だんだん」, 「どんどん」, 「少しずつ」, and 「徐々に」 lie in the speed, nature, and formality of the change. Use 「だんだん」 for a continuous, steady, and often natural progression in general conversation. Use 「どんどん」 when the change is rapid, forceful, or dramatic, or when encouraging rapid action. 「少しずつ」 is for incremental, deliberate changes, often implying conscious effort or measurement. 「徐々に」 is a more formal alternative to 「だんだん」, suitable for written contexts or more polite speech, but less natural for casual, ongoing processes.",
