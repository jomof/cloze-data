    "writeup": "「いる」 is a verb that means \"to exist\" or \"to be.\" It is used exclusively for **animate objects**, such as people and animals. To express the existence of inanimate objects, you must use 「ある」.\n\n*   The location of the animate object is typically indicated by the particle 「に」.\n\n*   There are humble and respectful alternatives to 「いる」, such as 「おる」 and 「いらっしゃる」, respectively. The appropriate form depends on the speaker's relationship with the subject of the sentence.\n\n    *   「おる」 is generally used when referring to oneself or someone within one's in-group.\n    *   「いらっしゃる」 is used when referring to someone of higher status or someone to whom one wishes to show respect.",
