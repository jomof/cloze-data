pronunciation:

  romaji: ori
formation:
  Vて + おり: Indicates a state or condition resulting from a previous action, used in formal speech and
    writing.
  おる + Verb: Indicates a continuous state or an ongoing action where 『おる』 functions as an auxiliary verb,
    replacing 『いる』 to add formality or humility.
  Noun + で + おる: Expresses a state of being a noun in a formal or humble context. It functions similarly
    to 『でいる』.
  Adjective + で + おる: Less common, but can express being in a state described by an adjective in a formal
    or humble context, akin to 『でいる』 for adjectives (though typically adjectives directly conjugate).
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: formal
  function: Indicates a continuous state or action, often with a humble or formal nuance. It connects
    two clauses, where the first describes a state or action that is ongoing or has resulted in a certain
    state, and the second provides further information or a consequence. It is a humble form of 『いる』 (iru)
    when used as an auxiliary verb.
  nuance: While 『いる』 (iru) is a neutral verb for existence or progressive action, 『おる』 (oru) adds a layer
    of humility and formality. It is often used by speakers to show deference to the listener or reader,
    or to maintain a respectful tone in formal settings. This humility is not self-abasement, but rather
    a way of elevating the person to whom one is speaking or writing. It can also imply a sense of continuity
    or persistence in a state or action.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a connective auxiliary verb, linking a preceding verb in its て-form (Vて
    + おる) to subsequent clauses. It can also appear independently as a main verb, replacing 『いる』, particularly
    in its humble usage. It serves to convey an ongoing condition or a result of an action with added
    politeness or humility.
  temporal-flow: Primarily indicates ongoing states or actions, similar to 『～ている』, but often implying
    a more continuous or established state rather than a momentary one. The action or state denoted by
    the preceding verb (in て-form) is portrayed as continuing up to the present moment or having resulted
    in a stable condition. It can also denote a habitual or customary action.
etymology: Ori (おり) is the ren'yōkei (連用形), or masu-stem, of the auxiliary verb oru (おる). Oru itself is
  the humble form (謙譲語) of iru (いる), indicating existence or a state. As an auxiliary verb, ori connects
  to the te-form of other verbs, expressing a continuous state or a state resulting from an action. Historically,
  『おる』 was a common verb of existence used broadly, but over time, 『いる』 (iru) became the more common,
  neutral term, and 『おる』 evolved into a more humble or formal variant. Its use as a humble equivalent
  to 『～ている』 is a later development, emphasizing politeness in describing ongoing situations.
writeup: |-
  『おり』 is an auxiliary verb derived from 『おる』 (oru), which is the humble form (謙譲語・kenjōgo) of 『いる』 (iru), meaning "to be" or "to exist." As an auxiliary verb, 『おり』 primarily serves to indicate a state or situation that results from a preceding action, or an ongoing action or state. It is commonly used in **formal writing and speech**, where politeness and humility are valued. You will typically find it connected to the て-form of verbs (Vて + おり), forming expressions like 『～ております』.

  For example, while 『知っています』 (shitte imasu) means "I know" in a general polite sense, using 『知っております』 (shitte orimasu) adds a layer of humility and formality, often seen in business or customer service contexts. It conveys the nuance of "being in a state (of knowing), and as a result..." or "because of being (in a state of knowing), therefore..."

  While 『おる』 itself is often described as a humble verb, its use can also simply elevate the register to a formal or polite one, especially in its 『～ております』 form. The plain form 『おる』 can sound old-fashioned or even slightly brusque in casual conversation if not used by an older speaker in a familiar context. However, its various conjugated forms are indispensable in business Japanese and formal communications.

  It is important to remember that while 『おる』 is the humble form of 『いる』, it is not always interchangeable with 『いる』. Its specific function as an auxiliary verb, especially in the 『～ております』 form, gives it a unique role in expressing ongoing states or actions with appropriate formality and humility. When 『おる』 is used as a main verb (e.g., to say "I am here" humbly), it directly replaces 『いる』.

  - term: いる
    meaning: to be, to exist (animate objects)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Ori (おり) is a more polite expression of existence, conveying a sense of humility, primarily
      used in written language and formal speech. In contrast, iru (いる) is more general and widely used
      in everyday conversation.
    grammar_point: いる (to exist, animate)
  - term: ございます
    meaning: to be, to exist (polite)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 『おり』 is a humble auxiliary verb, 『ございます』 is a polite form of 『ある』 (aru), used for inanimate
      objects or to express existence in a very formal and respectful way. 『おり』 is more focused on humble
      progressive or resulting states.
    grammar_point: ございます (polite 'to be or exist')
  - term: なさる
    meaning: to do (honorific)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『なさる』 is an honorific verb, used to show respect to the actions of someone else. 『おり』, on
      the other hand, is a humble auxiliary verb that typically describes one's own state or actions,
      or the state of something else, in a polite or humble manner, often in relation to the listener.
    grammar_point: なさる (honorific verb)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between these related expressions, remember that 『おり』 (oru)
  functions primarily as a humble or formal equivalent to 『いる』 (iru) for ongoing states or actions, especially
  when you are describing your own actions or states to a superior or in a formal context. 『ございます』 is
  the polite form of 『ある』 (aru) and focuses on the existence of inanimate objects or concepts in a highly
  respectful manner. 『なさる』 is used to respectfully describe the actions of others, particularly those
  of higher status. Each serves a distinct purpose within the intricate hierarchy of Japanese politeness.

          to explain a restaurant policy to a customer, emphasizing the established state of the business
          operation. We're looking for a formal, humble connective that emphasizes the existing state

          communicate its policy to customers. The use of 『～ております』 in official communications like store
          notices adds a layer of politeness and formality, which is appropriate for informing customers
          about policies.

    register: formal
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: |-
      The formal 『おりまして』 (orimashite) and 『おります』 (orimasu) create an unusual, almost overly polite tone for a flirty comment, which can come across as earnest or slightly humorous. The phrase 『夢中になっております』 (muchū ni natte orimasu) is a very strong, formal declaration of being captivated, which in this context conveys deep infatuation. The speaker's earnestness is highlighted by this formality, which can be interpreted as charming by the listener. It's a way of saying "I am so captivated by you that I am using the most respectful language possible to express it."
       This exaggerated politeness for a romantic declaration can be endearing or intriguing.

post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, the specific conjugation of 『おる』 will greatly
  influence the nuance and register of your sentence. While its humble and polite forms are essential
  in formal and business settings, its plain forms, particularly 『おった』, can carry a warm, intimate, or
  even old-fashioned tone when used in casual, personal contexts by certain speakers. Always consider
  your audience and the situation when choosing between plain and polite forms, and the various connective
  forms of 『おり』. Mastering these nuances allows for a richer and more appropriate expression in Japanese.
