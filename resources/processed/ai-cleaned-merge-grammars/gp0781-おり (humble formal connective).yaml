jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: kenjōgo (humble)
  usage-context: Primarily used in formal or business settings, when addressing superiors, clients, or
    a general audience where humility and respect are paramount. It is almost exclusively used to describe
    the speaker's or their in-group's actions or states.
  function: To convey humility and politeness regarding the speaker's own actions, state, or presence,
    thereby elevating the listener.
  nuance: Indicates a deep sense of respect and humility. It is a more formal and humble expression than
    〜ています and should be used cautiously to avoid sounding overly stiff in casual contexts, or inappropriately
    humble when referring to others.
  counterpoint: The polite form 〜ています. While 〜ています is polite, 〜ております adds a layer of humility from the
    speaker towards the listener, making it suitable for kenjōgo contexts.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a humble auxiliary verb, modifying the preceding te-form verb to express
    continuous action or state with humility.
  temporal-flow: Indicates an ongoing or continuous action/state, similar to 〜ています, but with added humble
    nuance.
etymology: The verb 「おる」 originates from 「居る」(おる), which historically meant "to stay," "to be," or "to
  sit." Over time, 「おる」 evolved to serve as a humble alternative for 「いる」 (to exist, animate) and, by
  extension, 「ある」 (to exist, inanimate) when referring to one's own or one's in-group's state or actions.
  Its prevalent use in the 「〜ております」 construction firmly established its role as a cornerstone of formal
  Japanese humility, emphasizing the speaker's deference towards the listener.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「おり」 refers to the humble form of the verb 「いる」 (to exist, animate) or 「ある」 (to exist, inanimate), primarily used as a connective in formal and humble speech. Its most common application is in the form 「〜ております」, which serves as the humble equivalent of 「〜ています」. This construction is crucial for demonstrating politeness and respect, especially in business, customer service, or other formal interactions.

  When you use 「〜ております」, you are humbling your own actions or state, or those of your in-group (e.g., your company, family), to elevate the listener. For instance, instead of saying 「待っています」 (I am waiting) in a formal setting, you would say 「お待ちしております」 to show greater deference.

  **Key Considerations:**
  *   **Subject:** This form is almost exclusively used for the speaker or members of the speaker's in-group. Using it to describe someone outside your in-group, especially a superior or client, would be inappropriate, as it implies humbling *them*.
  *   **Context:** It is standard in formal situations, such as conversations with clients, superiors, or in public announcements. In casual conversation, it would sound overly stiff or even sarcastic.
  *   **Nuance:** While 「〜ています」 conveys politeness, 「〜ております」 adds a layer of deep humility and respect. It's not just about politeness; it's about acknowledging one's lower status in relation to the listener.
  *   **Difference from 「〜ています」:** Both indicate ongoing actions or states. However, 「〜ております」 (kenjōgo) humbles the speaker, while 「〜ています」 (teineigo) simply expresses politeness without explicit humbling.

  Mastering 「おり」 in its various forms, particularly 「〜ております」, is essential for navigating formal Japanese communication effectively and demonstrating appropriate social etiquette.

    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「でございます」 is a humble form of the copula 「です」 used for identities or attributes (e.g., これはペンでございます).

post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the distinction between 「おり」 as a humble verb connective and
  other similar-sounding or looking expressions is vital. The context and the part of speech are your
  best clues. Always remember that the humble verb 「おり」 (as in 「おります」) is about humbling the speaker's
  actions or state, while the noun 「折」 refers to a time or occasion. Similarly, distinguish it from other
  humble forms like 「でございます」 based on whether you are describing an action/state or an identity/attribute.

  humble the speaker's or their in-group's actions, states, or intentions. This usage is fundamental in
  formal and business Japanese to show respect and deference to the listener. It's important to remember
  that while 「〜ています」 is simply polite, 「〜ております」 specifically conveys humility and is reserved for situations
  where humbling oneself is appropriate. The conjugations (non-past, past, negative) follow standard polite
  verb patterns, but with the added humble nuance. Pay close attention to the context to ensure appropriate
  application of this formal expression. For verbs that are originally `〜する` verbs, using `〜いたしております`
  is also a common and often more explicitly humble variation.
