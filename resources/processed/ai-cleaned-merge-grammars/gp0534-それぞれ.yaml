    "etymology": "「それぞれ」 comes from the repetition of 「其 (そ) 」, which means 'that.' The idea is 'that and that,' implying each individual thing or person. It shares a root with demonstrative pronouns.",
    "writeup": "「それぞれ」 is a Japanese noun, frequently used adverbially, that conveys the meaning of \"each\" or \"respectively.\" It's similar to adverbs like 「ほとんど」, 「沢山」, and 「かなり」 in that it often precedes a whole sentence or a noun phrase marked with 「の」. The literal sense stems from repeating 「其」, originally pointing to 'that' (close to the listener), thus implying 'that and that,' which evolved to mean 'everyone' or 'each.' It's a versatile word, useful for indicating individual actions, preferences, or characteristics within a group.",
