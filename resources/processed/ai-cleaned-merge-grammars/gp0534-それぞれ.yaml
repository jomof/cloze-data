    "etymology": "「それぞれ」 stems from the repetition of the demonstrative pronoun 「其 (そ) 」 (so), meaning 'that.' Conceptually, its etymology can be understood as 'that and that,' which evolved to signify individual elements within a collective, thus leading to the meaning of 'each' or 'everyone.' This illustrates a linguistic process where a simple pointing gesture expands to encompass a distributive sense.",
    "writeup": "「それぞれ」 is a versatile Japanese term, primarily functioning as a noun but frequently used adverbially, akin to 'each' or 'respectively' in English. It serves to emphasize the individuality or distinctness of items, people, or actions within a group. This grammatical behavior is analogous to other nouns such as 「ほとんど」 (hotondo - mostly), 「沢山」 (takusan - a lot), and 「かなり」 (kanari - quite), which can similarly modify entire sentences or noun phrases. When 「それぞれ」 is followed by 「の」 (no), it explicitly modifies a subsequent noun, highlighting that noun's individual association (e.g., 「それぞれの意見」, \"each opinion\"). When used adverbially without 「の」, it typically precedes a verb or a clause, indicating that multiple subjects perform actions individually or possess distinct characteristics.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「それぞれ」 is standard in register and widely applicable across various contexts, from casual conversation to formal discourse.\n*   It is not gender-specific and can be used by speakers of all ages.\n*   Its use clarifies that actions or attributes apply to members of a group individually rather than collectively or uniformly.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「それぞれ」, which emphasizes individuality or distinction within a set, 「当たり」 is primarily used to express a rate or proportion, such as 'per person' (一人当たり - hitori atari) or 'per item' (品物当たり - shinamono atari). It focuses on quantity or allocation rather than unique characteristics."

            "meaning": "Each person, each, individual",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both 「それぞれ」 and 「各自」 (kakuji) can mean 'each,' 「各自」 specifically refers to individual *people* and often implies a responsibility or action to be taken by each person independently. 「それぞれ」 is broader, applying to things as well, and emphasizes the distinctness or individuality of items or actions within a group, rather than a duty."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「それぞれ」 and 「当たり」 can be translated as \"each\" in English, their applications differ significantly. 「それぞれ」 highlights the notion of distinctness or individuality among multiple entities, focusing on qualitative differences or separate actions. In contrast, 「当たり」 quantifies a distribution or rate, indicating how much or how many apply to each unit. Understanding this distinction is crucial for precise expression in Japanese. Similarly, while 「各自」 can also mean 'each,' it primarily refers to individuals and their independent actions or responsibilities, whereas 「それぞれ」 is more general and focuses on distinctness among various items or people.",
