    "etymology": "「それぞれ」 stems from the repetition of the demonstrative pronoun 「其 (そ) 」, meaning 'that.' Conceptually, its etymology can be understood as 'that and that,' which evolved to signify individual elements within a collective, thus leading to the meaning of 'each' or 'everyone.' This illustrates a linguistic process where a simple pointing gesture expands to encompass a distributive sense.",
    "writeup": "「それぞれ」 is a versatile Japanese term, primarily functioning as a noun but frequently used adverbially, akin to 'each' or 'respectively' in English. It serves to emphasize the individuality or distinctness of items, people, or actions within a group. This grammatical behavior is analogous to other nouns such as 「ほとんど」 (mostly), 「沢山」 (a lot), and 「かなり」 (quite), which can similarly modify entire sentences or noun phrases. \n\nWhen 「それぞれ」 is followed by 「の」, it explicitly modifies a subsequent noun, highlighting that noun's individual association (e.g., 「それぞれの意見」, \"each opinion\"). When used adverbially without 「の」, it typically precedes a verb or a clause, indicating that multiple subjects perform actions individually or possess distinct characteristics. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「それぞれ」 is standard in register and widely applicable across various contexts, from casual conversation to formal discourse.\n*   It is not gender-specific and can be used by speakers of all ages.\n*   Its use clarifies that actions or attributes apply to members of a group individually rather than collectively or uniformly.",
