id: gp0181
meaning: Suffix added to names, primarily for males, expressing familiarity, a slightly informal tone,
  or a hierarchical relationship.
pronunciation:
  katakana: クン
  romaji: kun
formation:
  '[Last Name] + 君': Used with a surname, often by a superior or elder addressing a junior or younger
    male, or among male peers.
  '[First Name] + 君': Used with a given name, typically conveying familiarity or endearment, common among
    peers, or by parents to their sons.
  '[Full Name] + 君': Used with a full name, often in formal announcements or official contexts, indicating
    respect for the person's identity while maintaining a subtle hierarchical or formal tone.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The kanji 君 originally meant "lord" or "ruler." While it retains some sense of respect, as
  a suffix, it softens and conveys familiarity. It can also be used when addressing young children of
  either gender, implying a form of gentle authority or endearment.
writeup: |-
  The suffix 君・くん is an honorific primarily used to address males, conveying a sense of familiarity, informality, or a subtle hierarchical relationship. It is commonly attached to the first or last name of someone of equal or lower status than the speaker. For example, a male teacher might address a male student as 田中{君}・たなかくん. However, it's important to note that its usage can be more complex and is not always strictly limited to male-to-male interactions.

  While predominantly used for males, there are specific contexts where 君・くん can be applied to females. A male of higher status (e.g., a male teacher or senior colleague) might address a female of lower rank or age with 君・くん. Similarly, a female student might use 君・くん to address a male student of equal or lower rank.

  君・くん is frequently encountered in schools, workplaces, and various informal social settings where there's a clear understanding of hierarchy or a close relationship. It is considered less formal or universally polite than さん, but it carries more respect than completely omitting an honorific (呼び捨て・よびすて).

  Its usage often implies a gentle authority or a sense of caring from the speaker's perspective, especially when used by parents towards their sons or by superiors towards their subordinates. Understanding these nuanced applications based on context and speaker/listener relationship is crucial for proper usage.
false_friends:
  - term: さん
    meaning: Mr., Ms., Mrs., honorific suffix
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: さん is a universally polite and gender-neutral honorific used for adults. Unlike 君, it does
      not carry implications of hierarchy or a specific level of familiarity; it is generally safe to
      use in most situations where politeness is required.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:さん (honorific suffix)
  - term: ちゃん
    meaning: Suffix used for young children, close female friends, or lovers
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ちゃん conveys a strong sense of endearment and closeness. It is most commonly used for young
      children (especially girls), pets, or among very close female friends and romantic partners. It
      is more intimate and less formal than 君, and generally not used in hierarchical or professional
      contexts.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ちゃん (honorific suffix)
  - term: 様・さま
    meaning: Mr., Ms., Sir, Ma'am (highly respectful)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 様・さま is a highly formal and respectful honorific used for customers, superiors, deities, or
      in very formal written communication. It expresses a much higher degree of respect than 君 and implies
      a significant distance in status.
    grammar_point: 様・さま (honorific suffix)
  - term: 呼び捨て (yobisute)
    meaning: Calling someone by their name without an honorific
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 呼び捨て is the act of calling someone by their name without any suffix, implying extreme closeness
      or, if misused, extreme rudeness. It contrasts with 君 which, even when informal, still retains a
      degree of honorific function.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:呼び捨て (yobisute)
  - term: 君 (pronoun)
    meaning: You (casual, often masculine or used by superiors)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike the suffix 君, which attaches to a name, the independent pronoun 君 directly refers to
      the listener. While both can carry a sense of informality or implied hierarchy, the pronoun functions
      as a direct address and is often used by males or superiors towards subordinates/juniors.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:君 (pronoun)
post_false_friends_writeup: To effectively differentiate between these honorifics and 君・くん, consider the
  context, gender, and relationship dynamic. 君 is specifically tailored for addressing males, often with
  a subtle nuance of hierarchy or familiarity. さん is a default polite choice for general respect. ちゃん
  signifies deep affection, especially for children or close relationships. 様 is reserved for the highest
  level of respect. Finally, 呼び捨て is the complete absence of honorifics, reserved for very intimate or
  disrespectful interactions.
examples:
  - english: Sato, please submit today's assignment by tomorrow morning.
    japanese:
      - 佐藤 {君}、今日 の 課題 は 明日 の 午前 中 まで に 提出 し て ください。
      - 佐藤 {君}、本日 の 課題 は 明朝 まで に 提出 を お 願い し ます。
    english_literally: Sato-kun, today's assignment please submit by tomorrow morning.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 佐藤 {さん}、今日 の 課題 は 明日 の 午前 中 まで に 提出 し て ください。
        english: Mr. Sato, please submit today's assignment by tomorrow morning.
        hint: さん is a universally polite honorific without the implied hierarchical relationship that
          君 carries from a professor to a student. We're focusing on the professor's subtle authority
          here.
    scene: A university professor is reminding a male student about an upcoming deadline.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The professor uses 「佐藤 {君} 」 to address the male student, which is common in academic settings
      to denote a hierarchical relationship while still being respectful. The use of 「して ください 」 indicates
      a polite command from a superior. This example demonstrates the use of 「君」 with a last name in a
      formal, instructional context.
    etymology: The phrase 「午前中 」 (gozenchū) means "during the morning," with 「午前 」 referring to the period
      before noon and 「中 」 indicating "during" or "within."
  - english: Hey, Kenta! Wanna play a game together?
    japanese:
      - おい、健太 {君}！一緒 に ゲーム し ない？
      - おい、健太 {君}！一緒 に ゲーム やら ない か？
      - よう、健太 {君}！一緒 に ゲーム し ない？
    english_literally: Hey, Kenta-kun! Game together won't you?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - おい、健太 {ちゃん}！一緒 に ゲーム し ない？
        english: Hey, Kenta-chan! Wanna play a game together?
        hint: ちゃん is typically used for young children or female friends and carries a much stronger sense
          of endearment or cuteness. Here, we're looking for a casual but slightly less intimate address
          among male friends.
    scene: A high school boy casually inviting his male friend to play video games at his house.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker uses 「おい 」 to get his friend's attention, a common casual address among young
      males. Following it with 「健太 {君} 」 for his male peer adds a friendly, familiar tone, common among
      friends who are not necessarily the absolute closest, or to slightly soften the casual address.
      This example uses 「君」 with a first name in a casual setting among peers.
    etymology: The interjection 「おい 」 is an onomatopoeic word, stemming from the sound used to call attention,
      similar to "hey" or "hoi."
  - english: Tanaka, could you please check these documents soon?
    japanese:
      - 田中 {君}、この 資料、早め に 確認 し て おい て くれる か な？
      - 田中 {君}、この 資料、早め に 確認 し て おい て ください。
      - 田中 {君}、こちら の 資料 を 早め に ご 確認 いただけ ます でしょう か。
    english_literally: Tanaka-kun, these documents, soon check will you?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 田中 {さん}、この 資料、早め に 確認 し て おい て くれる か な？
        english: Mr. Tanaka, could you please check these documents soon?
        hint: While さん is generally polite, using 君 by a senior colleague to a junior male colleague subtly
          emphasizes the internal company hierarchy. We're illustrating that specific dynamic.
    scene: A senior colleague asking a male junior colleague to review documents quickly.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Here, a senior male colleague addresses a junior male colleague with 「田中 {君} 」. This is a
      common practice in Japanese companies to address subordinates, showing their position while still
      maintaining a professional tone. 「して くれる かな ？ 」 is a semi-formal, slightly softer way to make a
      request. This demonstrates 「君」 with a last name in a professional, hierarchical context.
    etymology: The phrase 「早め に 」 combines 「早い 」 (hayai, early/fast) and the suffix 「め 」 (me), indicating
      "to some extent" or "a bit more," thereby meaning "a bit early" or "sooner rather than later."
  - english: Taro, dinner's ready! Come quickly.
    japanese:
      - 太郎 {君}、ご飯 だ よ！早く おい で。
      - 太郎 {君}、ご飯 だ よ。早く 来 て ね。
      - 太郎 {君}、ごはん でき た よ！早く お いでー！
    english_literally: Taro-kun, it's meal! Quickly come here.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 太郎 {ちゃん}、ご飯 だ よ！早く おい で。
        english: Taro-chan, dinner's ready! Come quickly.
        hint: ちゃん is very commonly used for children, especially young boys, for extreme cuteness, while
          君 from a parent to a son can subtly imply a parental authority or more traditional endearment,
          rather than just cuteness.
    scene: A mother calling her young son to the dinner table.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The mother uses 「太郎 {君} 」 to address her young son, which is a common and affectionate way
      for parents to call their children. The use of 「だ よ 」 and 「おいで 」 are casual and direct. This showcases
      「君」 with a first name in a familial, intimate setting, conveying endearment from a parent to a child.
    etymology: The phrase 「ご飯 だ よ 」 uses 「ご飯 」 (gohan), originally meaning cooked rice, but commonly extended
      to mean "meal." 「だ よ 」 is a casual sentence-ending particle combination for assertion and emphasis.
  - english: Today, to Yamada Taro, who shone with the excellence award, congratulations.
    japanese:
      - 本日、優秀 賞 に 輝い た 山田 太郎 {君}、お めでとう ござい ます。
      - 優秀 賞 受賞 の 山田 太郎 {君}、お めでとう ござい ます。
      - 本日、優秀 賞 を 受賞 さ れ た 山田 太郎 {君}、誠 に お めでとう ござい ます。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 本日、優秀 賞 に 輝い た 山田 太郎 {さん}、お めでとう ござい ます。
        english: Today, to Yamada Taro-san, who shone with the excellence award, congratulations.
        hint: In formal public announcements like this, especially for younger awardees, 君 is often preferred
          over the more general さん to acknowledge their age or student status in a more specific, traditionally
          formal manner.
    scene: An announcer congratulating a male student during a school award ceremony.
    register: formal
    setting: cautious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: In this formal announcement at an award ceremony, 「山田太郎 {君} 」 is used to acknowledge the male
      recipient. This usage is common in public settings (like schools or certain competitions) where
      a full name with 「君」 is used to formally recognize an individual, often a younger person, while
      maintaining a sense of formality and a subtle traditional hierarchical context. The phrase 「おめでとう
      ございます 」 is a formal congratulation.
    etymology: 「優秀賞 」 (yūshūshō) combines 「優秀 」 (yūshū, excellence/superiority) and 「賞 」 (shō, award/prize),
      directly translating to "excellence award."
  - english: Aoi, your report was well-researched, but try to summarize your findings more concisely next
      time.

      - 蒼井 {君}、レポート は よく 調べ られ て い まし た が、次回 は もう 少し 簡潔 に まとめ て いただけ ます でしょう か。
      - 蒼井 {君}、レポート は 非常 に よく 分析 さ れ て い まし た が、次回 は もう 少し 簡潔 に まとめ て ください。

      please.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 蒼井 {さん}、レポート は よく 調べ られ て い まし た が、次回 は もう 少し 簡潔 に まとめ て み て ください。
        english: Ms. Aoi, your report was well-researched, but try to summarize your findings more concisely
          next time.
        hint: While さん is a safe, polite option for anyone, the professor's use of 君 for a female student
          emphasizes the hierarchical relationship often found in academic settings, particularly from
          an older male superior.
    scene: A male university professor giving feedback to a female student after reviewing her term paper.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The professor's use of 「蒼井 {君}」 toward a female student implies a traditional hierarchical
      relationship, where the male superior gently guides the female subordinate. This usage, though decreasing,
      still occurs in some educational or professional settings. The polite request 「まとめ て み て ください」 softens
      the instruction.
    etymology: The verb 「まとめる 」 (matomeru) means "to gather, to summarize." It combines with 「簡潔 」 (kanketsu),
      meaning "concise" or "brief," to form the nuance of summarizing something succinctly.
  - english: Suzuki, please prepare the agenda for tomorrow's meeting.
    japanese:
      - 鈴木 {君}、明日 の 会議 の 議題 を 準備 し て ください。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 鈴木 {さん}、明日 の 会議 の 議題 を 準備 し て ください。
        english: Mr. Suzuki, please prepare the agenda for tomorrow's meeting.
        hint: While さん is the standard polite honorific, a female manager might use 君 to a male subordinate
          to clearly assert her professional authority within the company hierarchy, a nuance not present
          with さん.
    scene: A female manager instructing a male subordinate in an office setting.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: A female manager using 「鈴木 {君}」 to address a male subordinate is less common than a male manager
      doing so, but it is not incorrect. It emphasizes the manager's authority within the workplace hierarchy
      in a semi-formal but direct manner. 「準備 し て ください」 is a clear directive.
    etymology: The noun 「議題 」 (gidai) means "agenda" or "topic for discussion." It combines 「議 」 (gi),
      meaning "deliberation" or "council," and 「題 」 (dai), meaning "topic" or "subject."
  - english: Yuki, don't forget to clean your room before dad gets home.
    japanese:
      - 勇気 {君}、お 父 さん が 帰っ て くる 前 に 部屋 を 掃除 する の を 忘れ ない で ね。
      - 勇気 {君}、お 父 さん が 帰る 前 に 部屋 を 片付け て おい て ね。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 勇気 {ちゃん}、お 父 さん が 帰っ て くる 前 に 部屋 を 掃除 する の を 忘れ ない で ね。
        english: Yuki-chan, don't forget to clean your room before dad gets home.
        hint: While ちゃん is often used for younger children, especially boys, for extreme cuteness, 君 from
          an older brother to a younger brother maintains a sense of fraternal affection while also implying
          a slight seniority or responsibility.
    scene: An older brother reminding his younger brother about a chore while they are playing video games.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The older brother addresses his younger brother as 「勇気 {君}」. This is a common and affectionate
      way to address younger male siblings, combining familiarity with a slight sense of seniority. The
      phrase 「忘れ ない で ね 」 is a gentle reminder typical of sibling interactions.
    etymology: The phrase 「掃除 する 」 (sōji suru) means "to clean." 「掃除 」 (sōji) combines 「掃 」 (sō), meaning
      "to sweep," and 「除 」 (ji), meaning "to remove" or "to clean."
  - english: Koga, keep your eyes on the ball, focus!
    japanese:
      - 古賀 {君}、ボール から 目 を 離さ ない で、集中 だ！

          - '{古賀}、ボール から 目 を 離さ ない で、集中 だ！'
        english: Koga, keep your eyes on the ball, focus!
        hint: Calling someone by their name without an honorific (呼び捨て) can be too blunt or disrespectful,
          especially from a coach to a player. 君 maintains the coach's authority while still showing a
          degree of respect suitable for the player.
    scene: A baseball coach yelling instructions to a male player during practice after he missed a catch.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: A male coach using 「古賀 {君}」 to address a male player is very common in Japanese sports. It's
      a direct, instructional address that asserts the coach's authority while maintaining a team dynamic.
      「集中 だ！」 is a forceful but encouraging command. The phrase 「ボール から 目 を 離さ ない で 」 (don't take your
      eyes off the ball) is a common idiom.
    etymology: The verb 「離す 」 (hanasu) means "to separate, to release." In the context of 「目 を 離す 」, it
      means "to take one's eyes off." 「集中 」 (shūchū) means "concentration" and comes from 「集 」 (shū, to
      gather) and 「中 」 (chū, middle/center).
  - english: The list of successful applicants includes Mr. Hiroshi Tanaka.
    japanese:
      - 合格 者 一覧 に は、田中 広司 {君} の 名前 が あり ます。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 合格 者 一覧 に は、田中 広司 {さん} の 名前 が あり ます。
        english: The list of successful applicants includes Mr. Hiroshi Tanaka.
        hint: While さん is generally used for formal references, in official documents or public announcements
          listing younger individuals (like students or new hires), 君 with the full name is a specific
          formal convention to denote their status without implying familiarity.
    scene: A school official reading out names from a formal school document during a public announcement
      of new admissions.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: In formal written documents, especially in educational or official contexts, 「君」 is used after
      a full name to refer to younger male individuals, such as students or new recruits, in an objective
      and formal manner. This usage differs from spoken usage as it is more about categorization and official
      designation rather than direct address.
    etymology: 「合格 者 」 (gōkakusha) means "successful applicant." It combines 「合格 」 (gōkaku, passing an
      exam) and 「者 」 (sha, person). 「一覧 」 (ichiran) means "list" or "summary," literally "one glance."
post_example_writeup: Each example demonstrates how 君・くん is used to address males across various contexts
  and relationships, from formal academic settings to intimate family interactions. Pay attention to the
  subtle hierarchical or affectionate nuances it carries depending on the speaker's and listener's relationship
  and the context. For instance, while a professor might use 君 to a student to maintain authority, a mother
  uses it to her son out of endearment. Understanding these situational distinctions is key to mastering
  its appropriate use.
