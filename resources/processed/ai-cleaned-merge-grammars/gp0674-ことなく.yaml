    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことなく」 is derived from 「こと」 (koto), which means 'thing' or 'matter', and 「なく」 (naku), which is the adverbial form of 「ない」 (nai), meaning 'not'. The combination creates the meaning of 'without doing that thing/matter'.",
    "writeup": "「ことなく」 is used to express that an action is performed 'without' another action taking place. It is similar to 「ないで」 but is more formal and often implies a sense of contrast or that something unexpected has occurred. It is often used when (A) is something negative that was avoided, or when (A) is something desired that did not happen while (B) occurred.",
