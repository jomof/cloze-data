    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことなく」 is derived from 「こと」 (koto), which means 'thing' or 'matter', and 「なく」 (naku), which is the adverbial form of 「ない」 (nai), meaning 'not'. The combination creates the meaning of 'without doing that thing/matter'.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「ことなく」 is used to describe an action that is performed without another action taking place. It is similar in meaning to 「ないで」 or 「ずに」, both of which also convey 'without doing something'. However, 「ことなく」 carries a more formal, stiff, and often literary nuance, making it suitable for written texts, official statements, or situations where a dignified tone is desired. It can emphasize the complete absence of an action, sometimes implying a significant or surprising omission.",

            "nuance": "「ないで」 is typically more casual and lacks the strong contrastive or emphatic nuance found in 「ことなく」. It can also serve as a negative imperative ('don't do...')."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ずに」 and 「ないで」 can often be used in place of 「ことなく」, remember that 「ことなく」 is more formal. Therefore, reserve 「ことなく」 for written documents, formal speeches, or situations where you want to sound particularly polite or educated. In casual conversation, 「ずに」 or 「ないで」 are generally more appropriate.",
