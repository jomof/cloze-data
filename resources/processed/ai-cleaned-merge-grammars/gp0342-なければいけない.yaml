    "writeup": "「なければいけない」 is a grammatical structure used to express a sense of obligation or necessity. It translates to \"must do\" or \"have to do\" in English. It's essentially a double negative construction, implying that if you don't do something, it won't work out.\n\nThe structure is formed by taking the negative form of a verb (ない form), changing it to its conditional form (ば form), and then adding 「いけない」. For example, 「行かない」 (ikanai - not go) becomes 「行かなければいけない」 (ikanakereba ikenai - must go).\n\n「いけない」 (ikenai) implies that something is not acceptable or permissible if the action is not performed. It is more commonly used in speech than 「ならない」 (naranai), which carries a more formal tone.",
