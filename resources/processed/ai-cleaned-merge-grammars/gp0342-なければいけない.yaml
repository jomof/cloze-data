    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the conditional form of the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 (nakereba) meaning 'if not', combined with 「いけない」 (ikenai) meaning 'cannot go' or 'is not good'. The literal meaning is 'if (something) is not done, it cannot go/it's no good', which is equivalent to 'it must be done'.",
    "writeup": "「なければいけない」 is a grammatical structure used to express a sense of obligation or necessity. It translates to \"must do\" or \"have to do\" in English. It's essentially a double negative construction, implying that if you don't do something, it won't work out.\n\nThe structure is formed by taking the negative form of a verb (ない form), changing it to its conditional form (ば form), and then adding 「いけない」. For example, 「行かない」 (ikanai - not go) becomes 「行かなければいけない」 (ikanakereba ikenai - must go).\n\n「いけない」 (ikenai) implies that something is not acceptable or permissible if the action is not performed. It is more commonly used in speech than 「ならない」 (naranai), which carries a more formal tone.",
