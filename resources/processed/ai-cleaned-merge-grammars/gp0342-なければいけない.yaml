    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the conditional form of the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 (nakereba), combined with the verb 「いけない」 (ikenai), which means \"must not go\", \"is not good\", or \"is not allowed\". The literal meaning is \"if (something) is not done, it will not do/go\", which implies obligation or necessity.",
    "writeup": "「なければいけない」 expresses a strong sense of obligation or necessity. It translates to \"must do\" or \"have to do\" something.\n\nIt's formed by taking the negative form of a verb (ない form), changing it to the conditional 「～ければ」 form, and then adding 「いけない」. While similar to 「なくてはいけない」, 「なければいけない」 has a slightly more formal feel. Both indicate something 'must be done'.\n\nImportant notes:\n\n*   「いけない」 literally means \"must not go\", but in this context implies something undesirable will happen if the action is not performed.\n*   The 「いけない」 part can often be omitted in casual speech, leaving just 「なければ」.",
