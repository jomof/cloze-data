pronunciation:
  katakana: ニガテダ
  romaji: nigate da
formation:
  '[Verb-dictionary] + の + が + 苦手だ': Describes an action or activity that one is not good at or has an
    aversion to.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express one's lack of skill, aptitude, or strong personal disinclination towards
    an action or activity. Often carries a nuance of avoiding something because one is not good at it,
    or finds it difficult/unpleasant.
  function: Expresses a subjective inability or disinclination concerning an action, often implying avoidance
    or difficulty.
  nuance: While often translated as "to be bad at", it can also imply "to dislike" or "to have an aversion
    to" an activity, particularly if that aversion stems from a lack of skill or comfort. It's more personal
    than just "cannot do".
etymology: The term 苦手 (nigate) literally combines 苦い (nigai, "bitter") and 手 (te, "hand"), metaphorically
  meaning "a bitter hand" or "something one handles poorly." This contrasts with 得意 (tokui, "good at"),
  which means "a gained hand" or "advantageous hand." The の particle nominalizes the verb phrase, transforming
  the action into a concept, which then becomes the object of one's '苦手' (poorness/aversion).
writeup: |-
  The grammatical pattern **[Verb-dictionary]のが苦手だ** is used to express that someone is **bad at doing something**, or conversely, **dislikes doing something** because they lack skill or aptitude. This phrase highlights a personal weakness or aversion towards a particular action. It is often used when the speaker feels a sense of inadequacy or discomfort with the activity.

  This structure uses the nominalizer の (no) to turn a verb phrase into a noun clause, which is then marked by the subject particle が (ga) as the object of 苦手だ (nigate da). The phrase can be used in both casual (苦手だ) and polite (苦手です) registers.

  While often translated simply as 'to be bad at,' **苦手だ** carries a slightly different nuance than merely stating a lack of ability. It implies that one either genuinely dislikes the activity, or avoids it because they are not proficient, making it a more personal expression of inadequacy or dislike. It's not just that you *can't* do it, but perhaps you *don't like* to do it because you're not good at it, or it makes you uncomfortable.

  - term: '[Noun]が嫌いだ'
    meaning: to dislike (something)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 嫌いだ (kiraida) expresses general dislike, 苦手だ (nigate da) specifically implies dislike
      due to a lack of skill or aptitude, or an aversion to performing a specific action. 嫌いだ is a broader
      term for dislike without necessarily implying inability.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]が嫌いだ (to dislike)'
  - term: '[Verb-dictionary]のが嫌いだ'
    meaning: to dislike doing (something)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to [Noun]が嫌いだ, this expresses general dislike for an action. 苦手だ, however, specifically
      links the dislike or aversion to a lack of skill or an unpleasant experience with the activity itself.
      It implies a personal weakness.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]のが嫌いだ (to dislike doing)'
  - term: '[Noun]が下手だ'
    meaning: to be unskilled at (something)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 下手だ (heta da) strictly refers to a lack of skill or clumsiness in an objective sense. 苦手だ
      (nigate da) can also convey lack of skill, but it adds the nuance of personal aversion or dislike,
      making it more subjective and encompassing emotional discomfort. You can be 下手 at something without
      being 苦手 if you still enjoy it.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Noun]が下手だ (to be unskilled at)
  - term: '[Verb-dictionary]ことができない'
    meaning: cannot do (something)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This phrase simply states an inability to perform an action. 苦手だ goes beyond mere inability,
      suggesting that the reason for being 'bad at' something might also involve an emotional aversion
      or discomfort. You might be able to 'できない' (not able to do) something, but still not be '苦手' (have
      an aversion to it), if you don't mind trying.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-dictionary]ことができない (cannot do)
post_false_friends_writeup: "When differentiating between **苦手だ** and **嫌いだ**, remember that **苦手だ** often\
  \ implies that the dislike or aversion stems from a lack of proficiency or comfort with the activity.\
  \ For instance, if you say 歌うのが苦手です (Utatunoga nigate desu), it suggests you are not good at singing,\
  \ and perhaps you dislike it for that reason. If you say 歌うのが嫌いです (Utatunoga kirai desu), it simply\
  \ means you dislike singing, regardless of your skill level. \n\nSimilarly, while **下手だ** focuses purely\
  \ on objective skill level (e.g., 彼は絵が下手だ - Kare wa e ga heta da, 'He is bad at drawing'), **苦手だ** adds\
  \ a personal, subjective layer of aversion or discomfort (e.g., 彼は絵を描くのが苦手だ - Kare wa e o kaku noga\
  \ nigate da, 'He dislikes drawing because he's not good at it, or finds it unpleasant'). \n\n**[Verb-dictionary]ことができない**\
  \ is a direct statement of inability. While being 苦手 implies you *tend to be unable* or *find it hard*,\
  \ it's not a definitive statement of absolute impossibility like できない. You might still be able to do\
  \ something you're 苦手 at, but perhaps not well or willingly."

    nuance: Adding 本当に (hontouni, 'really') and the explanatory のです (no desu / n desu) softens the statement
      and emphasizes the personal feeling of inadequacy towards sports. It suggests not just a lack of
      skill but a genuine personal struggle or dislike that makes participating difficult.
post_example_writeup: Notice how **苦手だ** applies not just to physical skills but also to social interactions
  or even abstract tasks like remembering names or dealing with certain situations. It always carries
  that underlying feeling of personal discomfort or lack of aptitude towards the action described by the
  verb.
