    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ともなると」is derived from 「と」 (a particle indicating condition or result), 「なる」 (the verb 'to become'), and 「も」 (a particle adding emphasis). The combination highlights the idea that once a certain state is reached, a specific outcome naturally follows.",
    "writeup": "「ともなると」is a strong expression that emphasizes that once a certain threshold is reached, a specific outcome will occur. It's often translated as \"once (A), (B)\" or \"when (A), (B).\" The 「も」 adds a slight emphasis. While 「ば」 and 「と」 have slightly different nuances, they are often interchangeable in this grammar point.\n\n「ともなると」can follow nouns or verbs in their dictionary form. The emphasis is partly due to the function of the initial 「と」, which indicates that the outcome is unavoidable or expected. Using 「に」 instead of 「と」 (i.e., 「になると」) simply focuses on the transition from (A) to (B) without the implication of inevitability.",
