    "etymology": "The etymology of 「さぞ」 is somewhat uncertain, but it's believed to have originated from the verb 「然る (さる)」, meaning \"to be so\" or \"to be like that.\" Over time, it evolved into an adverb emphasizing the speaker's inference or assumption about a situation. There is a kanji form, 「嘸」, but it is rarely used.",
    "writeup": "「さぞ」 is a relatively formal adverb used to express a strong assumption or empathy towards someone else's situation or feelings. It conveys that the speaker understands or imagines the other person's feelings to a great extent. It's often translated as \"you must be very...\", \"how... you must be\", or \"I dare say...\" The speaker is essentially saying, \"I'm sure that must be the case, given the circumstances.\"  Since it's an adverb, 「さぞ」 typically appears at the beginning of the sentence, modifying the entire phrase that follows. The sentence often ends with 「だろう」 or 「でしょう」, indicating the speaker's inference is based on limited knowledge.",
