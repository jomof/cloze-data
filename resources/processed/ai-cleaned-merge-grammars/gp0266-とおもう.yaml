    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とおもう」 is derived from the particle 「と」, which indicates content or quotation, and the verb 「思う(おもう)」, meaning \"to think\". Together, they form a structure to express one's thoughts or opinions.",
    "writeup": "To express what you \"think\" in Japanese, the common expression 「とおもう」 is regularly used. This is a combination of the particle 「と」, plus the verb 「思う(おもう)\\」. 「とおもう」 can be used after any verb, い-adjective, な-adjective, or noun, but requires 「だ」 after a noun or な-adjective.\n\nAlthough this structure usually requires 「だ」 after nouns and な-adjectives, it is often omitted in casual speech.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   If you want to express what *someone else* is thinking, 「とおもっている」 is used. This is because 「とおもう」 has a sense of permanence, and thus is not something the speaker could know about another person. 「とおもっている」 can also be used to express your own thoughts when they are currently happening.",
