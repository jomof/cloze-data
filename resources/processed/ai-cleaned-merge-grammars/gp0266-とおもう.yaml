        "function": "Expresses the speaker's personal thought, opinion, or belief.",
        "nuance": "Implies subjectivity and a softening of the statement, contrasting with a direct factual assertion. The use of だ before と思う is optional in casual speech, especially after な-adjectives and nouns, which further softens the expression.",
        "counterpoint": "Contrasted with 〜と思っている, which is used for ongoing thoughts (speaker's) or reporting others' thoughts (as the speaker cannot directly know another's internal, static thought).",
        "grammatical-role": "The particle と quotes the preceding clause, making it the object of 思う."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とおもう」 is derived from the particle 「と」, which indicates content or quotation, and the verb 「思う(おもう)」, meaning \"to think\". Together, they form a structure to express one's thoughts or opinions.",
    "writeup": "To express what you \"think\" in Japanese, the common expression 「とおもう」 is regularly used. This is a combination of the particle 「と」, plus the verb 「思う(おもう)」. 「とおもう」 can be used after any verb, い-adjective, な-adjective, or noun, but requires 「だ」 after a noun or な-adjective in formal or written contexts.\n\nAlthough this structure usually requires 「だ」 after nouns and な-adjectives, it is often omitted in casual speech, which contributes to a softer, less assertive tone. This omission is particularly common in feminine speech or when generally softening a statement.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   If you want to express what *someone else* is thinking, 「とおもっている」 is used. This is because 「とおもう」, in its simple form, has a sense of permanence or direct access to the speaker's mind, and thus is not something the speaker could know about another person. 「とおもっている」 can also be used to express your own thoughts when they are currently happening or are ongoing.",
