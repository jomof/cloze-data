meaning: even though, despite
pronunciation:
  katakana: ツツモ
  romaji: tsutsumo
formation:
  Verb-stem + つつも: Used to express 'even though' or 'despite' an action or state, often highlighting an
    internal contradiction or conflict within the subject.
jlpt: N2
etymology: The origin of 「つつも」 lies in the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「つつ」, which indicates simultaneous
  or continuous action, derived from the particle 「つ」 (a connective). The particle 「も」, meaning 'even'
  or 'also', adds a concessive nuance. Thus, 「つつも」 literally means 'even while doing/being', evolving
  to express 'despite' or 'even though' by emphasizing the simultaneous existence of contradictory states
  or actions. This highlights the inherent tension between the two clauses.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「つつも」 is used to convey the meaning of "even though" or "despite." It connects two clauses where the second clause expresses something that occurs or is true, contradictory to the first clause. The key nuance of 「つつも」 is that it often implies an **internal conflict, regret, or a conscious awareness** of the contradiction on the part of the subject. It is frequently employed in more formal or literary contexts, particularly in written Japanese.

  This pattern highlights a situation where the subject knows or feels one thing, but acts, or finds themselves in a situation, contrary to that knowledge or feeling. For instance, if someone understands a situation is bad but continues with it, or has a certain feeling but acts against it, 「つつも」 is fitting. It's a way of saying, "I knew X, but I did Y anyway," or "Despite being X, Y happened."

  While similar to other concessive expressions, 「つつも」 distinctively emphasizes the subjective experience of the contradiction. The speaker or subject is typically aware of the discrepancy, which can lead to feelings of guilt, regret, or a simple acknowledgement of an unavoidable contradiction.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜ても (even if, even though)
    meaning: even if, even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ても」 is a general concessive form that means "even if" or "even though." It does not necessarily
      carry the nuance of internal conflict or self-awareness that 「つつも」 does. It simply states that despite
      a certain condition, something else happens.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: 〜のに (despite, although)
    meaning: despite, although (implying unexpectedness or dissatisfaction)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜のに」 expresses unexpectedness or dissatisfaction. It indicates that the second clause is
      contrary to what one would expect given the first clause, often with a feeling of complaint or surprise.
      Unlike 「つつも」, it doesn't necessarily focus on an internal struggle of the subject but rather on
      the objective discrepancy or the speaker's reaction to it.
    grammar_point: のに (unexpected result)
  - term: 〜ながら (while doing)
    meaning: while doing, at the same time as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ながら」 primarily denotes simultaneous actions. While 「ながらも」 (which is a variant of ながら and
      can be very similar to 「つつも」) can express concession, the basic 「ながら」 is about simultaneity without
      the strong implication of internal contradiction or regret present in 「つつも」.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]ながら・つつ (while doing)'
  - term: 〜けれども (although, but)
    meaning: although, but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜けれども」 is a straightforward conjunctive particle meaning "although" or "but." It connects
      two clauses that are somewhat contrary or provide contrasting information, but it lacks the specific
      nuance of internal conflict or regret characteristic of 「つつも」. It's a more neutral connective.
    grammar_point: しかし (but・however)
  - term: 〜にもかかわらず (despite, regardless of)
    meaning: despite, regardless of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜にもかかわらず」 conveys a strong sense of "despite" or "regardless of." It highlights that something
      happened or is true, completely unaffected by a condition that might logically hinder it. This often
      implies overcoming an obstacle, rather than an internal struggle. It is generally more formal and
      objective than 「つつも」.
    grammar_point: にかかわらず (regardless of)
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions convey a sense of concession or contradiction,
  「つつも」 is unique in its emphasis on the subject's internal state. It highlights a conscious, often regrettable,
  action or state that goes against what one knows or feels. In contrast, 「〜ても」 is a general 'even if',
  「〜のに」 expresses surprise or dissatisfaction with an unexpected outcome, and 「〜ながら」 is mainly about simultaneous
  actions (though 「ながらも」 can overlap with 「つつも」, its origin is simultaneity). 「〜けれども」 is a neutral 'but',
  and 「〜にもかかわらず」 emphasizes overcoming an external obstacle, not internal conflict. When choosing 「つつも」,
  consider if the contradiction involves a personal, conscious conflict or a feeling of knowing better.

        english: Even if I knew it was wrong, I stole a cookie.
        hint: 「〜ても」 generally expresses 'even if' without the strong emphasis on an internal, conscious
          contradiction or regret that 「つつも」 implies. We're looking for a grammar point that suggests
          internal conflict.

          physical state.

        english: She wanted to cry, but she made a smile.
        hint: 「〜が」 simply states a contrast. 「つつも」 specifically shows the internal struggle of wanting

  where an individual's actions or current state contradict their own knowledge, feelings, or principles.
  This internal tension is what sets 「つつも」 apart from other concessive expressions. It often conveys a
  subtle sense of self-awareness, resignation, or a determined adherence to a principle despite personal
  cost.
