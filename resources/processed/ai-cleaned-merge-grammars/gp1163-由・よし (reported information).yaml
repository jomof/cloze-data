details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  register: formal
  usage-context: Primarily in formal writing and formal speech, such as business correspondence, official
    announcements, or polite conversations when relaying information received from a third party.
  function: Conveys information obtained from a source, emphasizing that the speaker is merely reporting
    it, rather than stating it as a fact of their own knowledge.
  nuance: Adds a highly formal and polite tone, implying the information is reliable but not directly
    observed by the speaker. It suggests the information is taken from a trusted source, often for important
    news or announcements.
  counterpoint: とのこと (to no koto) - similar meaning, but can be slightly less formal.
etymology: The word 「由」 originally meant "reason" or "cause." Over time, it evolved to also indicate the
  source or origin of information, hence its use to convey "I heard from the source that...". Its association
  with formal contexts likely stems from its historical use in official documents and classical texts.
writeup: 「由・よし」 is a dependent noun used to convey information that one has learned from another source,
  functioning similarly to "I heard that..." or "It is said that..." in English. This grammar point primarily
  appears in **formal writing** and **formal speech**, often in settings like business correspondence,
  official announcements, or polite conversations where information is being relayed from a third party.
  The core function of 「由・よし」 is to indicate that the preceding statement is information received, rather
  than a direct observation or personal knowledge of the speaker. This adds a layer of **politeness and
  objectivity** to the statement, making it suitable for situations requiring a respectful or professional
  tone. It implicitly asserts that the information is from a reliable source. While 「由」 can be encountered
  in both written and spoken forms, its usage in modern Japanese conversation is quite limited, usually
  reserved for highly formal or solemn occasions. It is **more formal** than similar expressions like
  「とのこと」, which is more commonly used in general polite conversation. Although 「由」 is its primary kanji,
  it can also be written in hiragana as 「よし」, particularly when emphasizing its phonetic value or to avoid
  overly stiff kanji usage in certain contexts. However, in formal documents, the kanji 「由」 is generally
  preferred.

  - term: によると
    meaning: according to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「由・よし」, 「によると」 directly cites the source and is more commonly used in general contexts.
      It doesn't carry the same high level of formality or implication of importance as 「由・よし」.
    grammar_point: によると・によれば (according to)
  - term: そうだ
    meaning: I heard that; it seems
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「由・よし」, 「そうだ」 is much more casual and common in everyday conversation. It can also
      imply hearsay without a definite source, or refer to outward appearance ('it seems').
    grammar_point: 〜そうだ (hearsay)
  - term: とのこと
    meaning: I heard that; it is said that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While similar in meaning to 「由・よし」, 「とのこと」 is less formal and more versatile for conveying
      information received in polite, everyday communication. It's often used when quoting or summarizing
      what someone said.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:とのこと (reported information)
  - term: 旨 (むね)
    meaning: content of official message; gist
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「由・よし」, which emphasizes the source or reason for the information received, 「旨 (むね)」
      typically refers to the summary or main point of a formal message or instruction, often written.
      While both are formal, 「旨」 is more about the substance of a communication.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:旨 (gist of message)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「由・よし」 is primarily reserved for highly
  formal or official contexts, especially when relaying significant or important information received
  from a reliable source. 「によると」 is a more general phrase for citing sources, suitable for various registers.
  「そうだ」 is very common and casual, often implying hearsay or appearance. 「とのこと」 serves as a polite and
  commonly used alternative for relaying information in less formal, but still respectful, everyday communication.
  Finally, 「旨 (むね)」 focuses on the content or gist of a formal message rather than the source of the information
  itself.

        english: According to informed sources, your company is flourishing. I sincerely congratulate
          you.
        hint: 「によると」 requires an explicit source before it, unlike 「由」 which follows the reported information.
          We're looking for a grammar point that conveys the information as being from a very formal,
          internal source.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 御 社 益々 ご 清栄 の {旨}、心 より お 慶び 申し上げ ます。
        english: I heard your company is flourishing, and I sincerely congratulate you.
        hint: 「旨 (むね)」 is used for official notices or reports, often implying written communication,
          but 「由」 is more about the source of information or reason. We're looking for a grammar point
          that emphasizes receiving information from a reliable source in a highly formal context.

        english: Regarding your company's further prosperity, I offer my congratulations from the heart.
        hint: 「につき」 means 'pertaining to' or 'because of' and is a conjunction that connects reasons or
          circumstances. It doesn't imply information received from a third party like 「由」. We're looking
          for a grammar point that conveys information heard from a source.
    scene: A business professional writing a formal congratulatory letter to a partner company upon hearing
      news of their success.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The usage of highly honorific language like 「御社」 (your company) and 「ご清栄」 (flourishing prosperity)
      combined with 「お慶び申し上げます」 (I sincerely congratulate you) demands the utmost formality. 「由」 is perfectly
      suited here to convey information about the company's prosperity from a reliable, perhaps official,
      source, maintaining the solemnity and professionalism of the congratulation.

        hint: 「旨 (むね)」 typically follows a noun or plain verb form and signifies the 'gist' or 'contents'
          of a communication, often written. 「由」 specifically points to the source of the information
          or the reason. We're looking for a grammar point that focuses on the information being received

      a humble and formal expression, clearly establishes a business and formal context. 「由」 here conveys
      the information as an official report from a trusted source, suitable for relaying confirmed attendance
      in a professional exchange between colleagues.

      「由」 is chosen to convey significant, officially reported information with appropriate gravity to
      a general audience, as would be expected from a spokesperson.

        english: The content of the exam being very difficult is what was heard.

    scene: A teacher discussing student feedback on an exam with a colleague in a formal setting.

    nuance: The use of 「難しかった」 (was difficult), an い-adjective in plain past form, combined with 「由」,

      discussion. The overall formal register is maintained even when discussing a subjective experience
      like 'difficulty'.

    register: formal
    setting: academic

      authoritative source of the information. The use of 「高い」 (high, plain form of an i-adjective) followed
      by 「由」 in 「効果が高い由」 gives the statement an objective, factual tone, appropriate for conveying confirmed
      scientific results in a formal, academic or professional setting.

    scene: A legal counsel or executor formally announcing the execution of a will.

    setting: professional
    nuance: 「ご遺志」 (the director's will, honorific) and 「寄付されることになりました」 (will be donated, formal passive)
      indicate a significant, official decision. 「由」 here formalizes the communication of this directive,
      acting as a direct report of the will's contents, underscoring its authoritative source.

        hint: While 'とのこと' works for general reported information, in an academic or historical context
          where the information is presented as a known 'fact' or 'claim', 「由」 adds a more objective and
          established tone. We're looking for a grammar point that presents historical claims as established

        english: According to historians, the ancient ruins were built by a mysterious civilization.
        hint: 「によると」 explicitly names the source. 「由」, when used without an explicit preceding source,
          implies a more generalized 'it is said' or 'it is understood' in formal contexts. We're looking

        english: The gist is that the ancient ruins were built by a mysterious civilization.
        hint: 「旨 (むね)」 conveys the main content or point. 「由」 specifically implies that this information
          has been reported or passed down from a source, which is fitting for historical facts. We're
          looking for a grammar point that emphasizes the information's reported nature in a historical
          context.
    scene: A historian or archaeologist presenting findings to a general audience or in an academic lecture.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「謎の文明によって築かれた」 (built by a mysterious civilization) describes an ancient, unconfirmed fact.
      「由」 gives this statement the weight of reported or generally accepted historical information, rather
      than a personal speculation, fitting an academic context.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「由・よし」 consistently maintains a high level of
  formality, making it appropriate for official communications, business contexts, and when relaying significant
  information derived from reliable sources. It's distinct from more casual reporting expressions and
  even other formal options like 「旨」 by its specific emphasis on the information's origin or reason. Pay
  close attention to the context and the level of formality required when choosing between 「由・よし」 and
  similar expressions.
