  katakana: ニクイ

formation:
  Verb[ます stem] + にくい: Indicates that something is difficult to do, often due to an inherent quality or
    objective circumstance.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General use, describing inherent or objective difficulty.
etymology: The grammar point 「にくい」 originates from the classical Japanese `ku`-form ending of adjectives
  expressing difficulty. Its root is directly connected to the adjective `難い (かたい)` (or `かたし` in classical
  form), meaning "difficult" or "hard," which shares the same kanji 難. Over time, this `ku`-form combined
  with the `masu` stem of verbs, developing into the modern `~にくい` construction. The shared kanji 難 with
  `難しい (むずかしい)` (difficult) reinforces its core meaning of inherent or practical difficulty, rather than
  a subjective or emotional one.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「にくい」 is attached to the ます-stem of a verb to indicate that an action is **difficult to perform**. This difficulty typically stems from an inherent quality of the object, a lack of necessary skill, or an objective circumstance that makes the action challenging. It functions grammatically like an い-adjective.

  For example:
  *   このペンは**書きにくい**。 (This pen is **hard to write with**.) - *The pen itself has a characteristic that makes writing difficult.*
  *   あの人は**話しかけにくい**。 (That person is **hard to talk to**.) - *The person's demeanor or circumstances make approaching them difficult.*

  **Key Nuance and Distinction from Similar Expressions:**

  While 「にくい」 translates to "hard to do," its nuance is crucial for correct usage. It emphasizes **objective or inherent difficulty**. This contrasts with other expressions:

  *   **〜づらい (zurai)**: This expression also means "hard to do," but it carries the nuance of **subjective difficulty** or **discomfort**. The difficulty arises from the speaker's personal feelings, physical discomfort, or a psychological burden that makes the action unpleasant or unbearable. For instance, if you are ill, you might say 「喉が痛くて、食べづらい。」 (My throat hurts, so it's **hard/uncomfortable to eat**.) Here, the difficulty is personal and stems from pain.

  *   **〜がたい (gatai)**: This implies a strong emotional or moral impossibility. It means something is "hard to do" because it goes against one's feelings, principles, or expectations, often suggesting an unlikelihood or incredulity. For example, 「信じがたい話」 (an **unbelievable** story) means it's hard to believe due to the shocking nature of the content.

  In summary, 「にくい」 focuses on the **practical aspects of difficulty**, whether due to design, skill, or environment. 「づらい」 points to **personal discomfort**, and 「がたい」 suggests an **emotional or moral barrier** making an action difficult or impossible.

  - term: やすい
    meaning: Easy to, Likely to
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike {にくい}, {やすい} means something is easy or likely to do, indicating the opposite of difficulty.
    grammar_point: やすい (easy to do・likely to)
  - term: がたい
    meaning: Hard to, Difficult to
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both mean 'hard to do,' {がたい} implies a strong emotional or moral impossibility, making
      it difficult to do something against one's feelings or principles. {にくい} refers to practical or
      inherent difficulty.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:がたい (difficult to)
  - term: づらい
    meaning: Hard to, Difficult to (due to discomfort)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Both mean 'hard to do,' but {づらい} emphasizes difficulty caused by the speaker's personal discomfort,
      pain, or psychological burden, making the action unbearable. {にくい} refers to an inherent, objective
      difficulty.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[masu-stem]+づらい (difficult to due to discomfort)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「にくい」, 「づらい」, and 「がたい」, consider the nature of the
  difficulty. Use 「にくい」 when the difficulty arises from an objective characteristic or external factor,
  such as a poorly designed object or a task requiring specific skills. Use 「づらい」 when the difficulty
  is personal, caused by discomfort, pain, or an emotional burden. Use 「がたい」 when the action is difficult
  due to a strong emotional or moral barrier, making it nearly impossible or unbelievable. For example,
  if a chair is uncomfortable to sit in, it is 「座りづらい」; if the chair is broken and hard to sit on, it
  is 「座りにくい」; if it is hard to accept someone's unkind words, it is 「受け入れがたい」.
