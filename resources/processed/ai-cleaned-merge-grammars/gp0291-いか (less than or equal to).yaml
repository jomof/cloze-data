pronunciation:
  katakana: イカ
  romaji: ika
formation:
  Amount + 以下: Indicates something is less than or equal to a specified amount.
  以下の + Noun: Indicates something that follows. This form is particularly used in written communication
    to introduce lists or details that will be presented immediately after the phrase itself, often literally
    'below' in a document. For instance, 「以下の点にご注意ください」 means 'please pay attention to the following points'.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: suffix
  register: formal
  usage-context: General, frequently used in official documents, instructions, and setting quantitative
    limits.
  function: Specifies a maximum value or introduces subsequent information.
  nuance: Implies a hard boundary (inclusive of the specified value) or signals the start of a list/explanation.
  grammatical-role: Acts as a quantifier for numerical limits or as a discourse marker for upcoming information.
  logical-flow: In its quantitative use, it establishes an upper bound. In its informational use, it guides
    the reader to subsequent details, implying a logical flow where further information is to be found
    'below' or 'after'.
etymology: 'The term 「以下」 is composed of two kanji: 「以」 (i), meaning "by means of" or "from," and 「下」
  (ka), meaning "below" or "under." Thus, 「以下」 literally signifies "from below," indicating a value or
  position that is at or below a certain point. Its usage for "the following" evolved from its role in
  documents, signifying "what comes below this point."'
writeup: The grammar point 「以下」 (ika) serves two primary functions in Japanese, both derived from its
  literal meaning of "below" or "under." It is essential for specifying limits and for introducing subsequent
  content. Firstly, 「以下」 is used to denote a quantity or value that is **"less than or equal to"** a stated
  amount. When attached directly to a numerical value, a counter, or an amount, it includes that specific
  amount as the upper boundary. For instance, 「５００円以下」 means "500 yen or less." This is a precise and
  common usage in rules, specifications, and pricing, often seen in official notices, regulations, and
  product descriptions. Secondly, 「以下」 is employed to mean **"the following"** or "hereafter." This usage
  is particularly prevalent in written communication, such as official documents, reports, and presentations.
  Phrases like 「以下の通り」 (as follows) or 「以下の点にご注意ください」 (please note the following points) are standard
  ways to direct the reader's attention to information that will be presented immediately after. This
  function acts as a formal signpost, indicating that details are about to be laid out.
false_friends:
  - term: 以上
    meaning: More than (or equal to), Over・(and) above, Any more・Greater, Exceeding
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「以下」, 「以上」 indicates that something is at or or above a certain limit.
    grammar_point: 以上 (more than or equal)
  - term: 未満
    meaning: Less than, under (a specified amount, explicitly excluding that amount).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「以下」 which includes the specified numerical value, 「未満」 explicitly excludes it. For
      example, 「20歳以下」 includes 20-year-olds, while 「20歳未満」 means 'under 20', excluding 20-year-olds.
    grammar_point: 未満 (strictly less than)
  - term: 以内
    meaning: Within (a certain range or limit); inside.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「以下」 typically refers to a value being less than or equal to a specific point, 「以内」
      refers to something being 'within' a range or boundary, often implying a space or time limit. For
      example, 「10分以内」 means 'within 10 minutes'.
    grammar_point: 以内 (within)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the precise difference between 「以下」, 「以上」, 「未満」, and 「以内」 is
  crucial for accuracy in Japanese, especially in formal contexts. While 「以下」 and 「以上」 set inclusive upper
  and lower bounds respectively, 「未満」 explicitly excludes the number, and 「以内」 refers to being contained
  'within' a limit, often spatial or temporal. These distinctions are critical in legal documents, technical
  specifications, and general precise communication.
examples:
  - english: The student discount applies to those 25 years old or younger.
    japanese:
      - 学生 割引 は ２５ 歳 {以下} の 方 に 適用 さ れ ます。
      - 学生 割引 は ２５ 歳 {以下} の 方 が 対象 です。
    english_literally: Student discount, 25 years old and under people to applies.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 学生 割引 は ２５ 歳 まで の 方 に 適用 さ れ ます。
        english: The student discount applies to those up to 25 years old.
        hint: 「まで」 indicates 'up to' a certain point. While often inclusive, 「以下」 is more commonly used
          and formal for stating a specific upper age limit, explicitly including the age itself. We're
          looking for a formal term that means '25 years old or less'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 学生 割引 は ２５ 歳 未満 の 方 に 適用 さ れ ます。
        english: The student discount applies to those less than 25 years old.
        hint: 「未満」 (miman) means 'less than', explicitly excluding the specified number. Here, the discount
          includes those who are exactly 25 years old. We're looking for a term that means '25 years old
          or less'.
    scene: A university staff member explains eligibility for a student discount to a new student.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「～に適用されます」 makes the statement formal and objective, common in institutional settings.
      「２５歳以下」 specifies the age limit, which is inclusive of 25 years old, a precision valued in official
      communication. This phrasing is neutral in terms of gender or age, focusing on the policy itself.
  - english: Please keep the weight of this bag to 5kg or less.
    japanese:
      - この バッグ の 重 さ は ５ kg {以下} に し て ください。

      - competing_japanese:
          - この バッグ の 重 さ は ５ kg まで に し て ください。
        english: Please keep the weight of this bag up to 5kg.
        hint: 「まで」 indicates 'up to' a certain point. While it can imply inclusivity, 「以下」 is a more formal
          and precise term for 'less than or equal to' a specific numerical limit, especially in official
          instructions. We're looking for a formal way to express '5kg or less'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この バッグ の 重 さ は ５ kg 以内 に し て ください。
        english: Please keep the weight of this bag within 5kg.
        hint: 「以内」 (inai) means 'within' a certain range or limit. While it also implies inclusivity,
          「以下」 more directly translates to 'less than or equal to' and is often preferred for exact numerical
          upper bounds. We're looking for a phrase that means '5kg or less'.
    scene: An airline attendant instructs a passenger at check-in about luggage weight limits.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「～にしてください」 is a polite request, emphasizing the desired state. The use of 「重さ」
      (weight) with 「５kg以下」 clearly indicates a physical limit, specifically '5kg or less'. A female attendant
      might use this polite framing in a service context, maintaining an appropriate level of formality
      with a customer.
  - english: Students who score 60 points or less on the exam must take a retest.
    japanese:
      - 試験 で ６０ 点 {以下} の 学生 は 再 テスト を 受け なけれ ば なり ませ ん。

        english: Students who score less than 60 points on the exam must take a retest.
        hint: 「未満」 (miman) explicitly means 'less than', excluding the stated number. In this case, 60
          points itself is included in the retest requirement. We're looking for a phrase that means '60
          points or less'.
    scene: A high school teacher announces the grading policy after an exam.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The formal phrase 「～なければなりません」 (must) conveys a strict rule. 「６０点以下」 specifies the exact threshold
      for the retest, including those who scored exactly 60 points. An older teacher would typically use
      such formal language with students, reinforcing the seriousness of academic requirements.
  - english: For the sweets, two eggs or fewer are sufficient for the ingredients.
    japanese:

          - お 菓子 の 材料 は 卵 が 二 個 まで あれ ば 十分 です。
        english: For the sweets, up to two eggs are sufficient for the ingredients.
        hint: 「まで」 indicates 'up to' a certain point. While it can imply sufficiency, 「以下」 more precisely
          states 'two eggs or less' as the maximum amount. We're looking for a term that means 'two eggs
          or fewer'.
    scene: A baking instructor explains how many eggs are needed for a recipe.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「～ば十分です」 (if ~ it's enough) indicates a practical limit. The grammar point 「二個以下」 specifies
      the maximum number of eggs, including two eggs. A male instructor might use this precise phrasing
      in a formal class setting, ensuring clarity for all students.
  - english: Admission is free for elementary school children and younger.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 小学 生 まで の お 子 様 は 入場 料 無料 です。
        english: Admission is free for children up to elementary school age.
        hint: While 「まで」 (until/up to) can convey a similar meaning, 「以下」 explicitly includes elementary
          school students and anyone younger. 「まで」 might be ambiguous about whether 'elementary school'
          itself is included or just the ages leading up to it. We're looking for a clear inclusive term,
          appropriate for official announcements to avoid confusion.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 小学 生 未満 の お 子 様 は 入場 料 無料 です。
        english: Admission is free for children younger than elementary school age.
        hint: 「未満」 (miman) means 'less than', explicitly excluding elementary school students. This sentence
          clearly states that elementary school students themselves are also included. We're looking for
          a term that explicitly includes elementary schoolers and those younger.
    scene: A notice at a museum entrance regarding ticket prices for children.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The formal language like 「お子様」 (children, respectful) and 「無料です」 (it is free) suits a public
      announcement. 「小学生以下」 sets the age bracket, including elementary schoolers and those even younger,
      ensuring clarity for families and aligning with official policies where precise age ranges are important.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 本日 の 報告 書 は 次 の 通り です。
        english: Today's report is as follows.
        hint: 「次の通り」 (tsugi no tōri) also means 'as follows' but doesn't necessarily imply that the content
          is literally 'below' or 'after' the current text in a document or presentation. 「以下」 specifically
          refers to content that is presented physically after the current point, which is typical for
          reports. We're looking for a formal term that literally means 'the following'.
    scene: A manager begins a presentation by introducing the day's report.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「以下の通りです」 is a very common and formal way to introduce content that immediately follows, often
      seen in business presentations or documents. It signals that the details are about to be presented
      immediately 'below' this statement. This phrase is gender and age-neutral, common in formal business
      communication.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 次 の ページ に は、データ が 示さ れ て い ます。
        english: While this sentence is grammatically correct, it lacks the specific nuance of 「以下」 which
          implies that the data being referred to is 'the following' or 'what is below' the current point
          of reference in a document. We're looking for a way to specify 'the following data'.
        hint: While this sentence is grammatically correct, it lacks the specific nuance of 「以下」 which
          implies that the data being referred to is 'the following' or 'what is below' the current point
          of reference in a document. We're looking for a way to specify 'the following data'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 次 の ページ に ある データ が 示さ れ て い ます。
        english: This phrase describes data that exists on the next page, but 「以下」 specifically emphasizes
          that this data is 'the following' data in a sequence or document. We're looking for a phrase
          that means 'the following data'.
        hint: This phrase describes data that exists on the next page, but 「以下」 specifically emphasizes
          that this data is 'the following' data in a sequence or document. We're looking for a phrase
          that means 'the following data'.
    scene: A presenter directs the audience's attention to a slide containing statistics.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: 「次のページに」 (on the next page) clearly indicates where the information will be found. 「以下のデータ」
      introduces the specific content that follows, emphasizing that the data is literally 'below' the
      current text in the presentation flow. The passive form 「示されています」 is common for objective presentation
      of facts in academic settings.

        english: The temperature today will be up to 20 degrees Celsius.
        hint: 「まで」 indicates 'up to' a certain point. While it can imply inclusivity, 「以下」 is more precise
          for explicitly including the given temperature as the upper limit. We're looking for a term
          that means '20 degrees Celsius or lower'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 の 気温 は ２０ 度 未満 でしょう。
        english: The temperature today will be less than 20 degrees Celsius.
        hint: 「未満」 (miman) means 'less than', explicitly excluding the specified number. Here, 20 degrees
          Celsius itself is included as a possibility. We're looking for a term that means '20 degrees
          Celsius or lower'.
    scene: A meteorologist reporting on the morning news.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「でしょう」 expresses a probability, suitable for a weather forecast. The formal tone

        english: Please write your answer in the next blank space.
        hint: While 「次 の」 (tsugi no) means 'next', 「以下」 specifically refers to content or space that is
          physically 'below' the current point in a document or on a page, which is more appropriate for
          written instructions, especially for exams. We're looking for a phrase that means 'the space
          below'.
    scene: A proctor addressing students at the start of an exam.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional

        english: For details, please refer to the next section.
        hint: Similar to previous examples, 「次 の」 (tsugi no) means 'next' in a sequence. However, 「以下」
          specifically implies that the item or section being referred to is 'below' the current position
          in the document. We're looking for a phrase that means 'the section below'.
    scene: A business professional explaining a complex proposal to a client.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「ご参照ください」 is a highly polite and formal request, suitable for professional and business contexts.

  - english: The minimum order quantity for this product is 10 units or more. Orders of 9 units or fewer
      cannot be accepted.
    japanese:
      - この 製品 の 最低 発注 量 は １０ 個 {以上} です。９ 個 {以下} の ご 注文 は お 受け でき ませ ん。
      - この 製品 は １０ 個 {以上} から の ご 注文 と なり ます。９ 個 {以下} は 受け 付け て おり ませ ん。
    english_literally: This product's minimum order quantity 10 pieces or more is. 9 pieces or less orders
      cannot be accepted.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 製品 の 最低 発注 量 は １０ 個 です。９ 個 未満 の ご 注文 は お 受け でき ませ ん。
        english: The minimum order quantity for this product is 10 units. Orders of less than 9 units
          cannot be accepted.
        hint: This example specifically highlights how 「以下」 contrasts with 「以上」 and defines the boundary.
          While 「未満」 might be used for 'less than 9', the use of 「以下」 here specifically refers to '9 or
          less', creating a clear, inclusive upper limit for what is not acceptable. We're demonstrating
          the contrast with 「以上」 and the boundary for unacceptable orders.
    scene: A sales representative explains ordering policies to a new client.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: negotiating
    nuance: This example directly contrasts 「以上」 and 「以下」 to define acceptable and unacceptable order
      quantities. The business Japanese register (「お受けできません」) emphasizes professionalism. The use of both
      terms within one statement is common in policy explanations to establish precise boundaries.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the context is key to distinguishing between 「以下」 meaning "less than
  or equal to" and "the following." When it precedes a noun or is used in a set phrase like 「以下の通り」, it
  signals upcoming content. When it modifies a number or quantity, it sets an inclusive upper limit. Pay
  close attention to whether the grammar point is used as part of a numerical expression or as a discourse
  marker for text organization; the latter is almost exclusively used in written contexts.
