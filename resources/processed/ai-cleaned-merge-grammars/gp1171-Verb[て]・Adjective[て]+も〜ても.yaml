        "Meaning": "This structure emphasizes the repetition of an action or state, highlighting that even with repeated effort or an extreme condition, the expected or desired result is not achieved.",
        "Usage": "Often used to express frustration, futility, or a sense of being stuck despite one's efforts.",
        "Example": "考えても考えてもわからない (kangaete mo kangaete mo wakaranai) - No matter how much I think about it, I don't understand."
    },
    "etymology": "The 「～ても」 form is derived from the conjunctive form of verbs and adjectives plus the particle 「も」, which adds the meaning of \"even if\" or \"even though.\" Repeating this structure emphasizes the persistence or intensity of the action or state being described. Its roots can be traced back to classical Japanese literature, where similar constructions were used to convey strong emphasis and emotional weight.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「Verb[て]・Adjective[て]+も〜ても」, is used to emphasize the repetition of an action or state, implying that even with repeated effort or an extreme condition, the expected or desired outcome is not achieved. It conveys a sense of futility or frustration.\n\nFor example, 「読んでも読んでも理解できない」 (yondemo yondemo rikai dekinai) means \"No matter how much I read it, I can't understand it.\"\n\nThe 「て」-form of the verb or adjective is repeated, connected by the particle 「も」. This repetition amplifies the sense of continuous or excessive action without the desired result. It's similar in meaning to 「いくら〜ても」 (ikura ~ te mo), but the 「〜ても〜ても」 construction often carries a stronger emotional weight.",

Choose 「～ても～ても」 when you want to stress the repetition and the resulting lack of progress, and 「いくら～ても」 when you simply want to state that something doesn't change despite the quantity or intensity."
