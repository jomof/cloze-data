    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "usage-context": "Used to express frustration, futility, or a sense of being stuck despite one's efforts.",
        "function": "Emphasizes the repetition of an action or state, highlighting that even with repeated effort or an extreme condition, the expected or desired result is not achieved.",
        "nuance": "This structure conveys a strong sense of persistence, futility, or exasperation, emphasizing that despite continuous or intense engagement with a situation, no progress or desired change occurs. It often implies an emotional weight not always present in simpler expressions."
    },
    "etymology": "The 「～ても」 form is derived from the conjunctive form of verbs and adjectives plus the particle 「も」, which adds the meaning of \"even if\" or \"even though.\" Repeating this structure emphasizes the persistence or intensity of the action or state being described. Its roots can be traced back to classical Japanese literature, where similar constructions were used to convey strong emphasis and emotional weight.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「Verb[て]・Adjective[て]+も〜ても」, is used to emphasize the repetition of an action or state, implying that even with repeated effort or an extreme condition, the expected or desired outcome is not achieved. It conveys a strong sense of futility or frustration. The 「て」-form of the verb or adjective is repeated, connected by the particle 「も」. This repetition amplifies the sense of continuous or excessive action without the desired result. It's similar in meaning to 「いくら〜ても」 (ikura ~ te mo), but the 「〜ても〜ても」 construction often carries a stronger emotional weight.",
