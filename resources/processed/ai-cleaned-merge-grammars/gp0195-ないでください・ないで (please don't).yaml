  meaning: Without doing; Don't do (a request)
  pronunciation:
    katakana: ナイデ
    romaji: naide
  formation:
    Verb[ない形] + で: Indicates an action performed without performing another action, or a request to not
      perform an action.
  jlpt: N4
  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    usage-context: General
  etymology: The grammar point 「ないで」 is formed from the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 and the particle 「で」.
    「で」 here retains its meaning of 'by means of' or 'with'. Therefore, it literally means 'by not doing'.
  writeup: The grammar point 「ないで」 (naide) functions in two primary ways. Firstly, it expresses an action
    (B) performed without first performing another action (A). This often implies that action (A) was expected
    but omitted, or that the omission of (A) is notable or surprising. For instance, 「朝ご飯を{食べないで}学校へ行った」
    (I went to school without eating breakfast) highlights the absence of eating breakfast before going
    to school.Secondly, 「ないで」 can be used to form polite negative requests or commands, indicating that
    one should not perform an action. For example, 「まだ{帰らないで}ください」 (Please don't go home yet) is a polite
    way to ask someone to refrain from leaving.It is crucial to distinguish 「ないで」 from 「なくて」. While both
    involve negation, 「ないで」 emphasizes the manner in which an action is performed (i.e., *without* doing
    something else) or a direct request *not to do* something. In contrast, 「なくて」 typically expresses a
    reason or cause for a state or action (e.g., 「時間がなくて行けなかった」 - I couldn't go *because I didn't have time*).
    「なくて」 focuses on the preceding clause as the *reason* for the following clause, whereas 「ないで」 connects
    two actions where the first is merely unperformed in relation to the second.
  false_friends:
    - term: ないでください
      meaning: Please don't do...
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「ないで」 can be used in general statements of not doing something, 「ないでください」 is specifically
        a polite request to *refrain* from an action.
      grammar_point: ないでください・ないで (please don't)
    - term: ずに
      meaning: Without doing
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「ないで」 is versatile for both 'without doing' and negative requests in various contexts,
        「ずに」 primarily means 'without doing' and is generally considered more formal or literary.
      grammar_point: ずに (without doing)
    - term: なくて
      meaning: Without doing; Because not
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: Unlike 「ないで」 which emphasizes an action performed without another, 「なくて」 primarily indicates
        a reason or cause for something not being done, often leading to a negative consequence or state.
      grammar_point: なくて (conjunction)
    - term: てください
      meaning: Please do (Polite request)
      kind: antonym
      nuance: Unlike 「ないで」 which expresses an action without doing another or a negative request, 「～てください」
        is a polite request to *do* something.
      grammar_point: てください (polite request)
    - term: なさい
      meaning: Command to do
      kind: antonym
      nuance: Unlike 「ないで」 which expresses an action without doing another or a negative request, 「～なさい」
        is a direct command to *do* something.
      grammar_point: なさい (polite imperative)
    - term: な
      meaning: Don't, Do not (Prohibitive)
      kind: synonym
      nuance: Unlike the broader uses of 「ないで」, 「～な」 is a very strong, casual, and direct prohibitive command
        to *not* do something.
      grammar_point: な (prohibitive particle)
    - term: Verb[ない] + まま
      meaning: While remaining in a state of not doing; without having done
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「ないで」 indicates an action performed without another action, 「ないまま」 specifically emphasizes
        that the state of 'not having done' something persists during the subsequent action. It literally
        means 'as if not having done'.
      grammar_point: まま (as is)
  post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between 「ないで」, 「ずに」, and 「なくて」, remember that 「ないで」 is
    a general way to express doing something without something else. 「ずに」 is its more formal counterpart,
    and 「なくて」 implies a reason or cause for something not being done.
  examples:
    - english: He went out without taking an umbrella.
      japanese:
        - 彼 は 傘 を {持た ない で} 出かけ た。
        - 彼、傘 を {持た ない で} 出かけ ちゃっ た よ。
        - 彼 は 傘 を {持た ない で} 家 を 出 て いっ た。
        - 彼 は 傘 を {持た ない で} 外 へ 出 た。
      english_literally: He umbrella not-having went out.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 は 傘 を {持た ず に} 出かけ た。
          english: He went out without taking an umbrella (more formal).
          hint: 「ずに」 is another way to say 'without doing something', but it often carries a more formal
            or literary nuance than 「ないで」. We're looking for a common, versatile expression.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 傘 が {なく て} 彼 は 出かけ た。
          english: Because he didn't have an umbrella, he went out.
          hint: 「なくて」 indicates a reason or cause. Here, we're talking about performing an action while
            omitting another, not a reason for the action. We're looking for 'without doing'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 傘 を 持っ {て 出かけ て ください}。
          english: Please take an umbrella and go out.
          hint: The sentence indicates an action performed without another. This is a request to do something.
            We're looking for the original meaning of 'without'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 傘 を 持っ {て 出かけ なさい}。
          english: Take an umbrella and go out!
          hint: This is a direct command. We're looking for the original meaning of 'without doing'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 傘 を {持つ な}。
          english: Don't take an umbrella.
          hint: 「～な」 is a very strong, direct prohibitive command, often used in casual or angry contexts,
            and usually applies to a single action. Here, we're describing an action taken *without* another
            action. We're looking for the sense of 'without doing'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 は 傘 を {持た ない まま} 出かけ た。
          english: He went out without having an umbrella (the state of not having continued).
          hint: 「～ないまま」 indicates that an action was performed while a certain state (of not doing something)
            continued. While very similar, 「ないで」 is more general for describing an action done *without*
            another. We're looking for a straightforward 'without doing'.
      scene: A man quickly leaves his house despite the weather.
      register: casual
      setting: cautious
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The use of 「持たないで」 here indicates the action of leaving was done while omitting the action
        of bringing an umbrella, implying it was a choice or oversight. The casual tone suits the everyday
        observation.
      etymology: 「出かける」 comes from 「出る」 (to go out) and 「掛ける」 (to hang, to start). Here, it means to start
        going out or to depart.
    - english: She quit the company without telling anyone.
      japanese:
        - 彼女 は 誰 に も {言わ ない で} 会社 を 辞め た。

          english: She quit the company without telling anyone (more formal).
          hint: 「ずに」 is a more formal alternative for 'without doing something'. We're looking for a more
            common, everyday expression.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 誰 に も {言わ なく て} 彼女 は 会社 を 辞め た。
          english: Because she didn't tell anyone, she quit the company.
          hint: 「なくて」 indicates a reason or cause. The original sentence describes the *manner* in which
            she quit. We're looking for 'without doing'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 誰 に も {言い なさい}。
          english: Tell everyone!
          hint: This is a direct command. The original sentence describes an action taken without another
            action. We're looking for 'without doing'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 誰 に も {言う な}。
          english: Don't tell anyone.
          hint: 「～な」 is a strong, direct prohibitive command. The original sentence describes an action
            taken without another action. We're looking for the sense of 'without doing'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼女 は 誰 に も {言わ ない まま} 会社 を 辞め た。
          english: She quit the company without having told anyone (the state of not telling continued).
          hint: 「～ないまま」 indicates that an action was performed while a certain state (of not doing something)
            continued. While very similar, 「ないで」 is more general for describing an action done *without*
            another. We're looking for a straightforward 'without doing'.
      scene: Colleagues are surprised by a coworker's sudden departure.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: informative
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: 「言わないで」 signifies the action of quitting was done while omitting the act of telling anyone.
        The use of 「辞めた」 (quit) combined with 「誰に も」 (to anyone) emphasizes the suddenness and lack of communication,
        suitable for relaying a surprising event.
      etymology: 「辞める」 (やめる) means to quit or resign. Its kanji 「辞」 relates to words, suggesting the act
        of formally notifying resignation, though here it's used with 「ないで」 to convey the opposite.
    - english: I failed when I tried cooking without looking at the recipe.
      japanese:

          hint: This is a direct command. The original sentence describes an action taken without another
            action. We're looking for 'without doing'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - レシピ を {見る な}。
          english: Don't look at the recipe.
          hint: 「～な」 is a very strong, direct prohibitive command, often used in casual or angry contexts.
            Here, we're describing an action taken *without* another action. We're looking for the sense
            of 'without doing'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - レシピ を {見 ない まま} 料理 を 作っ たら 失敗 し た。
          english: I failed when I tried cooking without having looked at the recipe (the state of not looking
            continued).
          hint: 「～ないまま」 indicates that an action was performed while a certain state (of not doing something)
            continued. While very similar, 「ないで」 is more general for describing an action done *without*
            another. We're looking for a straightforward 'without doing'.
      scene: Someone admits to a friend that their culinary experiment didn't go well.
      register: casual
      setting: humorous
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: 「見ないで」 naturally states the condition of not looking at the recipe, leading to the failure.
        The casual tone of the Japanese (e.g., 「失敗 した」) and the setting of a humorous admission among friends
        fits well.
      etymology: 「失敗」 (しっぱい) is a compound noun and verb meaning 'failure' or 'to fail'. 「失」 means 'lose'
        and 「敗」 means 'defeat'.
    - english: Please don't worry. I'm here.
      japanese:
        - 心配 {し ない で} ください。私 が い ます から。

        - 心配 {し ない で}。私 が いる から。

        - competing_japanese:
            - 心配 {し て ください}。私 が い ます から。
          english: Please worry. I'm here.
          hint: This is a polite request to *do* something, the opposite of the original sentence. We're
            looking for a polite request to *not* do something.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 心配 {し なさい}。
          english: Worry!
          hint: This is a direct command to *do* something. We're looking for a polite request to *not*
            do something.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 心配 {する な}。
          english: Don't worry.
          hint: 「～な」 is a very direct and strong prohibitive command, often considered harsh depending on
            context. While it means 'don't do', it lacks the politeness of the original request. We're looking
            for a polite negative request.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 心配 {し て は いけ ませ ん}。
          english: You must not worry.
          hint: 「～てはいけません」 is a strong prohibition, indicating something is forbidden or not allowed. The
            original sentence is a softer, reassuring request. We're looking for a gentle negative request.
      scene: A friend comforts another after a minor setback, assuring them of support.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: supportive
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The use of 「ないでください」 creates a soft and comforting tone for the request. The addition of 「私
        が いますから」 (because I am here) further emphasizes the supportive and reassuring nuance. For the second
        example 「心配 {しないで} ね」 adds a gentle, feminine touch, common among female friends. The third example
        「心配 {しないで}」 without 「ください」 is a more direct, yet still caring, casual address.
      etymology: 「心配」 (しんぱい) combines 「心」 (heart, mind) and 「配」 (distribute, arrange), literally meaning
        'to distribute one's heart' or 'to worry'.
    - english: Don't make noise here anymore.
      japanese:

        - もう ここ で {騒が ない で}。
        - もう ここ で {騒が ない で} ください。
        - もう ここ で は {騒が ない で} ほしい。
      english_literally: Already here not-making-noise particle.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - もう ここ で {騒い で ください}。
          english: Please make noise here anymore.
          hint: This is a polite request to *do* something, the opposite of the original sentence. We're
            looking for a negative request.
        - competing_japanese:
            - もう ここ で {騒ぎ なさい}。
          english: Make noise here anymore!
          hint: This is a direct command to *do* something. We're looking for a negative request.
        - competing_japanese:
            - もう ここ で {騒ぐ な}。
          english: Don't make noise here anymore.
          hint: 「～な」 is a very direct and strong prohibitive command, often considered harsh. While it means
            'don't do', it's much harsher than the original request using 「ないで」. We're looking for a slightly
            softer prohibitive.
        - competing_japanese:
            - もう ここ で {騒い で は いけ ませ ん}。
          english: You must not make noise here anymore.
          hint: 「～てはいけません」 is a strong prohibition, indicating something is forbidden. The original sentence
            is a direct request or command, but often less formal or strict than 「～てはいけません」. We're looking
            for a more common negative command.
      scene: A man asks a noisy child to quiet down in a public space.
      register: casual
      setting: commanding
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: The final particle 「よ」 in 「騒がないで よ」 adds a direct, emphatic, but not overly aggressive tone,
        common for a male speaker addressing a younger person or child. It's a casual warning. The second
        example 「騒がないで」 is slightly less emphatic but still firm. The third example 「騒がないで ください」 is a polite
        request, suitable if the speaker wanted to soften the command.
      etymology: 「騒ぐ」 (さわぐ) means to make noise, be boisterous. It is related to commotion or disturbance.
    - english: She worked straight through the afternoon without taking a break.
      japanese:
        - 彼女 は 休憩 を {取ら ない で} 午後 も ずっと 働い た。

            - 彼女 は 休憩 が {なく て} 午後 も ずっと 働い た。
          english: Because she didn't have a break, she worked straight through the afternoon.
          hint: 「なくて」 indicates a reason or cause. The original sentence describes the *manner* in which
            she worked. We're looking for 'without doing'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼女 は 休憩 を {取ら ない まま} 午後 も ずっと 働い た。
          english: She worked straight through the afternoon without having taken a break (the state of
            not taking continued).
          hint: 「～ないまま」 indicates that an action was performed while a certain state (of not doing something)
            continued. While very similar, 「ないで」 is more general for describing an action done *without*
            another. We're looking for a straightforward 'without doing'.
      scene: A coworker observes their diligent colleague.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: informative
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: 「取らないで」 emphasizes the omission of taking a break while continuing to work. The phrase 「午後
        も ずっと」 (throughout the afternoon as well) highlights the continuous nature of her work. This phrasing
        is common when describing someone's dedication or diligence. The second example uses 「ぶっ通し で」 (continuously,
        straight through), adding more emphasis to the unbroken work period.
      etymology: 「休憩」 (きゅうけい) combines 「休」 (rest) and 「憩」 (repose), meaning a period of rest or a break.
    - english: It's not good to be late without contacting.
      japanese:
        - 連絡 を {し ない で} 遅刻 する の は よく ない。

          english: It's not good to be late without contacting (more formal).
          hint: 「ずに」 is a more formal alternative for 'without doing something'. We're looking for a more
            common, everyday expression.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 連絡 が {なく て} 遅刻 する の は よく ない。
          english: Because there's no daily study, it's difficult to pass a test.
          hint: 「なくて」 indicates a reason or cause. The original sentence describes the *manner* of being
            late. We're looking for 'without doing'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 連絡 {なし で} 遅刻 する の は よく ない。
          english: It's not good to be late without contact.
          hint: 「～なしで」 uses the noun 「なし」 (absence) with 「で」 to mean 'without'. While similar, it can feel
            slightly more formal or direct compared to the verb conjugation of 「ないで」. We're looking for
            a verbal construction of 'without doing'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 連絡 を {し ない まま} 遅刻 する の は よく ない。
          english: It's not good to be late without having contacted (the state of not contacting continued).
          hint: 「～ないまま」 indicates that an action was performed while a certain state (of not doing something)
            continued. While very similar, 「ないで」 is more general for describing an action done *without*
            another. We're looking for a straightforward 'without doing'.
      scene: A supervisor gives advice to a new employee about workplace etiquette.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: instructional
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: group
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: This phrasing would be typical of an older male supervisor giving general workplace guidance.
        The straightforward statement 「よくない」 (is not good) combined with 「ないで」 makes it clear advice without
        being overly strict, suitable for a formal instructional context. The second example adds 「も」 to
        「しないで」, adding an emphasis of 'even without contacting', implying it's even worse.
      etymology: 「連絡」 (れんらく) combines 「連」 (to link, connect) and 「絡」 (to entwine, entangle), meaning communication
        or contact. 「遅刻」 (ちこく) combines 「遅」 (late) and 「刻」 (time, moment), meaning to be late or tardy.
    - english: I want you not to tell him about that.
      japanese:
        - 彼 に その こと を {言わ ない で} 欲しい ん だ。
        - 彼 に その こと {言わ ない で} 欲しい。
        - 彼 に は その こと を {話さ ない で} 欲しい ん だ。
      english_literally: Him to that thing not-saying I-want-it.

        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 に その こと を {伝え て 欲しい} ん だ。
          english: I want you to tell him about that.
          hint: This is a request to *do* something, the opposite of the original sentence. We're looking
            for a request to *not* do something.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 に その こと を {伝える な}。
          english: Don't tell him about that.
          hint: 「～な」 is a very direct and strong prohibitive command. While it means 'don't do', it lacks
            the nuance of a personal desire expressed by 「～て欲しい」. We're looking for an expression of desire.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 に その こと を {言っ て は いけ ない}。
          english: You must not tell him about that.
          hint: 「～てはいけない」 is a strong prohibition, indicating something is forbidden. The original sentence
            expresses a personal desire for someone not to do something, which is softer than a general
            prohibition. We're looking for an expression of desire.
      scene: A person confides a secret to a close friend and asks for discretion.
      register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
      setting: serious
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The use of 「欲しいんだ」 (I want it, in a slightly explanatory or casual tone) in combination with
        「言わないで」 creates an intimate and earnest plea. This phrasing, particularly the 「～んだ」 ending, is common
        among close female friends sharing something sensitive. The second example, 「言わないで 欲しい」, is slightly
        less explanatory but maintains the intimacy.
      etymology: 「欲しい」 (ほしい) is an adjective meaning 'wanted' or 'desired'. When combined with the て-form
        of a verb (or in this case, ないで), it expresses a desire for someone to do (or not to do) something.
    - english: It's difficult to pass a test without studying every day.
      japanese:

          english: It's difficult to pass a test without studying every day (more formal).
          hint: 「ずに」 is a more formal alternative for 'without doing something'. We're looking for a more
            common, everyday expression.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 毎日 勉強 が {なく て} テスト に 合格 する の は 難しい。
          english: Because there is no daily study, it's difficult to pass a test.
          hint: 「なくて」 indicates a reason or cause. The original sentence describes the *condition* for passing.
            We're looking for 'without doing'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 毎日 勉強 {なし で} テスト に 合格 する の は 難しい。
          english: It's not good to pass a test without daily study.
          hint: 「～なしで」 uses the noun 「なし」 (absence) with 「で」 to mean 'without'. While similar, it can feel
            slightly more formal or direct compared to the verb conjugation of 「ないで」. We're looking for
            a verbal construction of 'without doing'.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 毎日 勉強 を {し ない まま} テスト に 受かる の は 難しい よ。
          english: It's difficult to pass a test without having studied every day (the state of not studying
            continued).
          hint: 「～ないまま」 indicates that an action was performed while a certain state (of not doing something)
            continued. While very similar, 「ないで」 is more general for describing an action done *without*
            another. We're looking for a straightforward 'without doing'.
      scene: A student discusses their struggles with a friend.
      register: casual
      setting: academic
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: This sentence uses 「ないで」 to indicate the condition of not studying daily, making passing difficult.
        It's a common lament among students. The inclusion of 「毎日」 (every day) emphasizes the consistent
        effort required. The second example uses 「ないで は」 (cannot without doing) to emphasize the impossibility
        without daily study.
      etymology: 「合格」 (ごうかく) means passing an exam. 「合」 means 'to fit, meet' and 「格」 (かく) means 'status,
        rule', thus 'meeting the standard'. 「難しい」 (むずかしい) means difficult, challenging.
    - english: Don't forget your homework.
      japanese:
        - 宿題 を {忘れ ない で} ね。
        - 宿題 {忘れ ない で}。

      english_literally: Homework not-forgetting particle.

        - competing_japanese:
            - 宿題 を {忘れ て ください}。
          english: Please forget your homework.
          hint: This is a polite request to *do* something, the opposite of the original sentence. We're
            looking for a polite request to *not* do something.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 宿題 を {忘れ なさい}。
          english: Forget your homework!
          hint: This is a direct command to *do* something. We're looking for a polite request to *not*
            do something.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 宿題 を {忘れる な}。
          english: Don't forget your homework!
          hint: 「～な」 is a very direct and strong prohibitive command, often considered harsh depending on
            context. While it means 'don't do', it lacks the gentleness and nuance of a reminder. We're
            looking for a softer, cautionary request.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 宿題 を {忘れ て は いけ ませ ん}。
          english: You must not forget your homework.
          hint: 「～てはいけません」 is a strong prohibition, indicating something is forbidden. The original sentence
            is a softer, more personal reminder. We're looking for a gentle negative request.
      scene: A parent reminds their child before they leave for school.
      register: casual
      setting: instructional
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The phrase 「忘れ ない で ね」 is a common, gentle, yet firm reminder used by parents or guardians
        to children. The particle 「ね」 softens the imperative nature, making it sound more like a caring
        prompt than a strict command. This casual register is typical for intimate family interactions.
        If the speaker wanted to be more formal, they might use 「忘れ ない で ください」.
      etymology: 「宿題」 (しゅくだい) combines 「宿」 (lodging, inn; implying 'assigned to one's residence') and 「題」
        (topic, subject), referring to tasks given to be completed at home. 「忘れる」 (わすれる) means to forget.
    - english: Please don't open that box.
      japanese:

        - competing_japanese:
            - その 箱 を {開け て ください}。
          english: Please open that box.
          hint: This is a polite request to *do* something, the opposite of the original sentence. We're
            looking for a polite request to *not* do something.
        - competing_japanese:
            - その 箱 を {開け なさい}。
          english: Open that box!
          hint: This is a direct command to *do* something. We're looking for a polite request to *not*
            do something.
        - competing_japanese:
            - その 箱 を {開ける な}。
          english: Don't open that box!
          hint: 「～な」 is a very direct and strong prohibitive command. While it means 'don't do', it is much
            harsher than a polite request. We're looking for a polite negative request.
        - competing_japanese:
            - その 箱 を {開け て は いけ ませ ん}。
          english: You must not open that box.
          hint: 「～てはいけません」 is a strong prohibition, indicating something is forbidden. The original sentence
            is a softer, more direct request. We're looking for a polite negative request.
      scene: Someone warns another person about a delicate or dangerous package.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: cautious
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: Using 「開け ない で ください」 is a standard polite negative request, conveying a clear instruction
        without being overly demanding. The scenario of a delicate or dangerous package highlights the importance
        of the request. The second example 「開け ない で ね」 is a slightly softer version, often used between
        acquaintances or in less formal situations, still conveying caution.
      etymology: 「開ける」 (あける) means to open, derived from 「開く」 (ひらく) which means to open (intransitive).
        The causative form means to cause something to open. 「箱」 (はこ) means a box or case.
  post_example_writeup: Pay attention to the context when using 「ないで」. It's crucial to ensure that the sentence
    conveys the intended meaning of doing one action *without* doing another. Practice using it in different
    scenarios to get a feel for its nuances.

  jlpt: N4
  details:
    part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
    register: casual
    usage-context: Used to express a request or command not to do something, often in casual settings. Can
      be made polite with 「ください」.
  etymology: The grammar point 「ないで」 is derived from the negative form of a verb, 「ない」, combined with the
    particle 「で」. The auxiliary verb 「ない」 indicates negation. The particle 「で」, in this construction, functions
    to connect the negative verbal phrase, forming a direct or implied prohibition. It's akin to stating
    'by not doing (X)' or 'in the state of not doing (X)', leading to the nuance of 'please do not (X)'.
    The addition of 「ください」 further formalizes this request, making it a polite command.
  writeup: |-
    「ないで」 is a grammatical construct used to express a request or gentle command **not** to do something. While 「ないでください」 provides a more polite form, 「ないで」 on its own is frequently employed in casual contexts, particularly among close friends and family. It functions as a direct statement or a mild prohibition. Grammatically, this structure combines the auxiliary verb 「ない」, indicating negation, with the particle 「で」. To form it, attach 「ないで」 to the **negative stem** of the verb you wish to negate. The sentence often concludes directly with 「ないで」.

    It is crucial to distinguish this usage from the 「ないで」 that means 'without doing (A), (B)', which connects two clauses. This grammar point refers to the terminal usage as a request or command, where the sentence ends with 「ないで」 or 「ないでください」.
  false_friends:
    - term: なくて (conjunction)
      meaning: Without doing; Not ~ and ~
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: When used to mean "without doing", 「ないで」 connects two actions. For example, 「朝ご飯を食べないで学校へ行った」
        means "I went to school without eating breakfast." This 「ないで」 serves as a conjunctive particle,
        linking two clauses, and does not function as a request.
      grammar_point: なくて (conjunction)
    - term: てはいけない (must not・cannot)
      meaning: You must not; it is forbidden.
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: 「ないで」 is a softer request or gentle command, implying a wish or preference. 「～てはいけない」 is a
        strong prohibition or rule, indicating something is forbidden or highly discouraged, with a more
        authoritative tone.
      grammar_point: てはいけない (must not・cannot)
    - term: な (prohibitive particle)
      meaning: Don't, Do not (Prohibitive)
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: 「ないで」 is a polite or gentle request. 「～な」 is a very direct and often harsh command, typically
        used in informal settings or when scolding, with a strong, prohibitive tone.
      grammar_point: な (prohibitive particle)
    - term: なくてもいい (no need to)
      meaning: There is no need to; it's okay not to do.
      kind: antonym
      nuance: While 「ないで」 requests *not* to do something, 「～なくてもいい」 states that doing something is *unnecessary*
        or *permissible to omit*.
      grammar_point: なくてもいい (no need to)
  post_false_friends_writeup: 'It''s crucial to differentiate between 「ないで」 as a request and 「ないで」 indicating
    ''without doing''. Context is key: if it stands alone as a gentle command, it''s likely a request. If
    it connects two clauses, it probably means ''without doing''. 「ないで」 also differs from stronger prohibitions
    like 「～てはいけない」 or the blunt 「～な」 in its level of politeness and assertiveness. Furthermore, it''s the
    opposite of 「～なくてもいい」, which grants permission to omit an action.'
  examples:
    - english: Don't stop here!
      japanese:
        - ここ に 立ち 止ま {ない で}！
        - ここ に 立ち 止ま {ない で ください}。

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - ここ に 立ち 止まっ {て は いけ ない}。
          english: You must not stop here!
          hint: 「～てはいけない」 is a strong prohibition, like 'must not' or 'it is forbidden.' We're looking for
            a softer request.
      scene: A teacher instructing students in a busy hallway during school hours.
      register: casual
      setting: instructional
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      nuance: This direct command 「立ち止まないで」 (don't stop) is a common instruction given by figures of authority,
        such as teachers, in school environments. It is firm yet not overly harsh, conveying an expectation
        of obedience. The lack of 「ください」 makes it more direct. While it can be casual, in this context from
        a teacher, it is a straightforward instruction rather than an informal plea.
      etymology: The phrase 「立ち止まらないで」 combines 「立ち止まる」 (to stop) with the negative request form. This construction
        is common in directives, emphasizing the act of not stopping in a particular location, suggesting
        flow or continuation. The casualness suits an immediate, on-the-spot instruction to students to
        keep moving or clear the way, reflecting the dynamic nature of a busy school hallway. The nuance
        here is more about directing movement rather than strict prohibition, making it appropriate for
        a teacher guiding students.
    - english: Don't go with strangers.
      japanese:
        - 知ら ない 人 に は つい て いか {ない で}。

      english_literally: Unknown people to follow-go-not-by.
      competing_grammar:

            - 知ら ない 人 に は つい て いっ {て は いけ ない}。
          english: You must not go with strangers.
          hint: 「～てはいけない」 is a strong prohibition, like 'must not' or 'it is forbidden.' Here, we're looking
            for a more gentle warning.
      scene: A mother warning her young daughter about safety when they are out in public.
      register: casual
      setting: cautious
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: The casual 「ないで」 is appropriate for a parent speaking to their child. It conveys a direct
        warning. The absence of additional softening particles makes it a clear, simple instruction, suitable
        for safety advice. The phrasing 「知らない 人には」 (to unknown people) emphasizes the danger.
      etymology: The expression 「ついていかないで」 combines 「ついていく」 (to follow someone, to go with someone) with
        the negative request form. This phrase is a common way to express a warning or prohibition, especially
        in contexts of caution or safety. The nuance of 「ついていかないで」 is a gentle yet firm directive, often
        used by parents or guardians to convey important safety instructions without being overly harsh.
        It implies a protective sentiment, instructing the listener to avoid potentially dangerous situations.
    - english: Don't spend so much money.
      japanese:
        - そんな に お 金 を 使わ {ない で}。

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - そんな に お 金 を 使っ {て は いけ ない}。
          english: You must not spend so much money.
          hint: 「～てはいけない」 is a strong prohibition, like 'must not.' We're looking for a softer, advisory
            tone.
      scene: A mother advising her teenage son about managing his pocket money after he spent a lot on unnecessary
        items.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: This simple 「使わないで」 is a common, direct request in a casual family setting, emphasizing the
        speaker's concern about excessive spending. The absence of politeness markers highlights the intimacy
        of the relationship, allowing for a straightforward expression of mild disapproval. 「そんなに」 (so much)
        intensifies the request.
      etymology: The phrase 「そんなにお金を使わないで」 integrates 「そんなに」 (that much, so much) with 「お金を使う」 (to spend
        money) in the negative request form. This construction is often used to express a gentle reproof
        or advice regarding excessive action. The nuance here is one of concern and guidance rather than
        a strict prohibition, fitting a parental role. 「そんなに」 adds a sense of surprise or mild disapproval
        at the extent of the action, making the request more specific and personal.
    - english: Please don't drink so much.
      japanese:
        - そんな に たくさん 飲ま {ない で}。
        - そんな に たくさん 飲ま {ない で ください}。
      english_literally: So much a lot drink-not-by.

        - competing_japanese:
            - そんな に たくさん 飲ん {で は いけ ない}。
          english: You must not drink so much.
          hint: 「～てはいけない」 implies a stronger rule or prohibition. Here, the speaker is expressing concern
            in a softer way.
      scene: A friend expressing concern to another friend about their drinking habits at a party.
      register: casual
      setting: sympathetic
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The direct 「飲まないで」 without any additional particles indicates a straightforward concern often
        shared among close male friends, reflecting genuine care. The phrase 「そんなにたくさん」 (so much) emphasizes
        the quantity, conveying a clear message without being overly formal. This implies a friendly warning
        rather than a harsh reprimand.
      etymology: The expression 「そんなにたくさん飲まないで」 combines 「そんなにたくさん」 (such a large amount) with the negative
        request form of 「飲む」 (to drink). This is a very common phrase used to offer comfort or reassurance.
        The nuance of 「そんなにたくさん飲まないで」 is one of gentle encouragement to alleviate anxiety, implying that
        the situation might not be as bad as one thinks, or that worrying excessively is counterproductive.
        It's an empathetic expression used to console someone.
    - english: Don't run so much.
      japanese:
        - そんな に 走ら {ない で} よ。
        - そんな に 走ら {ない で}。

        - competing_japanese:
            - そんな に 走る {な} よ！
          english: Don't run so much, you hear!
          hint: 「～な」 is a very direct and often harsh command. We're looking for a gentler request, suitable
            for a parent to a child.
      scene: A parent gently asking their energetic child to calm down while playing inside the house.

      setting: supportive
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The casual 「走らないで」 is used in an intimate family context. The particle 「よ」 at the end softens
        the request into a gentle plea, common in affectionate speech from a parent to a child. This conveys
        concern rather than a strict command, suggesting an emotional appeal. The specific phrasing 「そんなに
        走らないでよ」 makes it sound like a loving mother's exasperated but soft request.
      etymology: The phrase 「そんなに走らないでよ」 combines the intensifying adverb 「そんなに」 (so much) with the negative
        request form of 「走る」 (to run), adding the sentence-final particle 「よ」. The 「よ」 particle adds emphasis,
        assertion, or a gentle emotional appeal, making the request softer and more intimate. This construction
        is commonly used within families to express a gentle directive or a plea, particularly from a parent
        to a child. The nuance is one of caring guidance, aiming to encourage a desired behavior without
        resorting to a harsh command, reflecting the close bond.
    - english: I want to talk more, so please don't go home yet.
      japanese:

            - もっと 話し たい から、まだ 帰る {な}。
          english: I want to talk more, so don't go home yet!
          hint: 「～な」 is a very strong and blunt command. The speaker here is making a gentle plea.
      scene: One person subtly expressing a desire to extend a first date, hinting at wanting to spend more
        time together.
      register: casual
      setting: first-date
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The casual 「帰らないで」 directly conveys a sincere desire for the interaction to continue, creating
        an intimate atmosphere that is perfect for a developing romantic relationship. The reason 「もっと話したいから」
        (because I want to talk more) makes the request feel earnest and personal. The lack of 「ください」 makes
        it a more direct and heartfelt plea.
      etymology: The sentence 「もっと話したいから、まだ帰らないで」 uses 「から」 (because) to state the reason for the negative
        request. 「まだ」 (still, yet) emphasizes the timing of the request, urging the listener not to leave
        at the current moment. This construction conveys a heartfelt plea or a gentle request, often used
        in personal or intimate settings. The nuance of 「まだ帰らないで」 is a soft, persuasive appeal, highlighting
        the speaker's desire for continued interaction. It implies a personal longing rather than a formal
        demand, making it suitable for expressing affection or a wish for more time together in developing
        relationships.
    - english: Please don't fall, okay?
      japanese:
        - 転ば {ない で ください} ね。

      english_literally: Fall-not-by, please, okay?
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 転ん {で は いけ ませ ん} ね。
          english: You must not fall, okay?
          hint: 「～てはいけません」 is a formal way to say 'you must not.' We're looking for a gentle, caring reminder.
      scene: A caring older sibling gently reminds their younger sibling to be careful while walking on
        an uneven path.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: supportive
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      nuance: The polite 「転ばないでください」 (please don't fall) is softened by the final particle 「ね」, transforming
        it into a gentle, caring suggestion rather than a stern command. This nuance is often used to express
        concern for the listener's well-being and is common in polite yet warm interactions, such as between
        siblings or friends. The phrase 「くださいね」 makes it a soft request.
      etymology: The phrase 「転ばないでくださいね」 combines the polite negative request 「転ばないでください」 with the sentence-final
        particle 「ね」. The 「ね」 particle seeks agreement or confirmation, and in this context, it softens
        the request further, making it sound more like a gentle suggestion or a caring reminder. This construction
        is commonly used when expressing concern for someone's well-being, conveying a warm and supportive
        tone. The nuance is a blend of polite instruction and affectionate concern, making it suitable for
        familial interactions where care is paramount.
    - english: Please do not enter here.
      japanese:
        - ここ へ は、入ら {ない で ください}。

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - ここ へ は、入っ {て は いけ ませ ん}。
          english: You must not enter here.
          hint: 「～てはいけません」 indicates a rule or strict prohibition. The speaker is giving an instruction
            in a slightly less authoritative, but still polite, manner.
      scene: A security guard politely giving an instruction to a visitor at the entrance of a restricted
        area.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: informative
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      nuance: This example uses the polite 「入らないでください」 to convey a clear, formal instruction, typical of
        official or public settings. It's a clear, impersonal instruction, avoiding the harsher tone of
        a direct prohibition. The use of 「ここへは」 (to here) specifies the location, making the instruction
        unambiguous and formal.
      etymology: The phrase 「ここへは、入らないでください」 explicitly uses 「ここへは」 (to here) to specify the location of
        the prohibition, followed by the polite negative request 「入らないでください」. This construction is formal
        and clear, commonly used in public or official settings where instructions need to be polite yet
        unambiguous. The nuance of 「入らないでください」 in this context is a formal directive, emphasizing that entry
        is not permitted, but delivered in a respectful manner. It is often seen in signage or spoken instructions
        by staff in places requiring regulated access.
    - english: Please don't disclose confidential information.
      japanese:
        - 機密 情報 を 漏ら {ない で ください}。
        - 機密 情報 を 漏ら {ない で}。
      english_literally: Confidential information leak-not-by, please.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 機密 情報 を 漏洩 し {て は いけ ませ ん}。
          english: You must not leak confidential information.
          hint: 「～てはいけません」 expresses a stronger prohibition or a rule that must be followed. We're looking
            for a polite request or instruction.
      scene: A manager speaking to employees during a training session on company policy.
      register: formal
      setting: informative
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      nuance: The use of 「漏らさないでください」 (please don't disclose) is appropriate in a professional setting where
        a clear, polite instruction regarding sensitive information is required. This phrasing is firm but
        respectful, suitable for a manager addressing their team. It conveys a standard of conduct without
        being overly authoritarian.
      etymology: The phrase 「機密情報を漏らさないでください」 combines 「機密情報」 (confidential information) with the negative
        request form of 「漏らす」 (to disclose, to leak). This construction is common in business or legal contexts
        for giving instructions or setting policies. The nuance is a formal directive that is expected to
        be followed, reflecting professional conduct and the importance of discretion regarding sensitive
        matters.
    - english: Don't worry too much.
      japanese:
        - あまり 心配 し {ない で}。
        - あまり 心配 し {ない で ください}。
      english_literally: Too much worry do-not-by.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - あまり 心配 する {な}。
          english: Don't worry too much!
          hint: 「～するな」 is a very direct and strong prohibition, often used in scolding. We're looking for
            a gentler, empathetic suggestion.
      scene: A friend comforting another friend who is anxious about something.
      register: casual
      setting: supportive
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      nuance: The casual 「心配しないで」 (don't worry) is a common expression of comfort among friends. The use
        of 「あまり」 (too much) adds a softening touch, indicating that some worry might be natural, but excessive
        worry is not helpful. This conveys empathy and support, typical for intimate conversations.
      etymology: The expression 「あまり心配しないで」 combines the adverb 「あまり」 (not much, not too) with the negative
        request form of 「心配する」 (to worry). This is a very common phrase used to offer comfort or reassurance.
        The nuance of 「あまり心配しないで」 is one of gentle encouragement to alleviate anxiety, implying that the
        situation might not be as bad as one thinks, or that worrying excessively is counterproductive.
        It's an empathetic expression used to console someone.
  post_example_writeup: The usage of 「ないで」 or 「ないでください」 allows for a range of expressions from casual requests
    to polite directives. The addition of sentence-final particles like 「よ」 or 「ね」 can further soften or
    emphasize the nuance, making the request sound more intimate, empathetic, or gently assertive. Understanding
    these nuances is crucial for effective communication in Japanese.

    Verb (ない form) + で + ください: Polite request not to do something
  jlpt: N5
  details:
    part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
    register: teineigo (polite)
  etymology: 'The grammar point 「ないでください」 is composed of: 「ない」, the negative form of a verb; the particle
    「で」, indicating a state or condition; and 「ください」, the polite imperative form of 「くださる」, meaning "to
    give" (in this context, used to request a favor).'
  writeup: |-
    「ないでください」 is an expression used to politely ask someone **not** to do something. It is a combination of the casual negative form of a verb, the particle 「で」, and 「ください」, which is the conjunctive form of 「くださる」. 「くださる」 itself is the honorific language equivalent of 「くれる」 (to give).

    「くださる」 (kudasaru) is categorized as honorific language (敬語 - keigo), a polite form of speech used when referring to the actions of others. The 「ください」 (kudasai) form of 「くださる」 is used almost exclusively for making requests.

    In friendly conversation, 「ください」 may be omitted from this expression, and the 「で」 form itself can be used as a very casual way to say "please don't do (A)".

    **Important Considerations**

    Although 「ください」 is the polite form of 「くれる」, using 「ないでくれ」 (the conjunctive form of 「くれる」) is generally considered far too casual in most situations.

    - term: ないで
      meaning: Without doing, Not ~ and ~, Please don't (casual)
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「ないで」 can function as a casual request to mean "please don't" by itself, it also commonly
        means "without doing" (e.g., 「ご飯を 食べないで 学校へ 行った」 - "I went to school without eating") or connects
        clauses (e.g., 「勉強 しないで 遊んだ」 - "I played without studying"). 「ないでください」 specifically forms a polite
        negative request.

    - term: な
      meaning: Don't, Do not (Prohibitive)
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「な」 is a very casual and direct prohibitive, meaning "don't!". 「ないでください」 is a much more polite
        and softer request, "please don't".
      grammar_point: な (prohibitive particle)
    - term: Verb-te + は いけません
      meaning: Must not do, It's not allowed to do
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「ないでください」 makes a polite request to refrain from an action, 「Verb-te + は いけません」 states
        a general prohibition or rule, indicating that an action is not permitted. The latter is a statement
        of rule, the former is a direct request.
      grammar_point: てはいけない (must not・cannot)
  post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between these expressions and 「ないでください」, remember that
    「ないでください」 is exclusively for making polite negative requests. Antonyms like 「てください」 and 「お〜ください」 are
    for positive requests. Similarly, 「なさい」 is a mild command or instruction to perform an action. The key
    distinction for 「ないで」 is its dual function as a casual negative request and a conjunction meaning "without
    doing," whereas 「ないでください」 is always a direct request to refrain from an action. 「な」 is a very strong,
    casual prohibition, unlike the politeness of 「ないでください」。 Lastly, 「Verb-te + は いけません」 expresses a general
    rule or prohibition, rather than a direct personal request to avoid an action.
