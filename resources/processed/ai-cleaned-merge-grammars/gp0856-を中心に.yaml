        "usage-context": "Used to describe the primary focus, main subject, or central element of an action, group, or situation. It can apply to physical centers (e.g., a city) or abstract concepts (e.g., a topic, a person). Generally used in standard communication, including formal writing and speech.",
        "function": "To specify the core element or primary area of concentration for an action or state.",
        "nuance": "While generally standard and versatile, its use often implies a deliberate or inherent focus. The addition of に emphasizes the target of the focus, while と can imply a more conclusive or decisive focus. The forms を中心とする/した/として provide flexibility in modifying nouns or acting adverbially.",
        "source": "This grammar point is widely used in both written and spoken Japanese, common in news, academic texts, and business communication."
    },
    "etymology": "「を中心に」 comes from the noun 「中心 (chuushin)」, meaning \"center\" or \"focus\", combined with the particle 「を (o)」, indicating the object of focus, and 「に (ni)」, indicating direction or location. So, literally, it means \"with the center at\". The combination signifies a central pivot point or the primary element around which something operates or from which something extends.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「を中心に」 indicates that a particular noun serves as the primary focus, central point, or main subject of an action, group, or situation. The literal translation of 「中心 (chuushin)」 is \"center\" or \"core\". Combined with the direct object particle 「を (o)」 and the directional particle 「に (ni)」, it literally means \"with (Noun) as the center.\" This conveys a sense of something revolving around, being concentrated on, or being primarily defined by the preceding noun.\n\nThis grammar point can be used in various contexts:\n*   **Physical or Geographical Center:** Describing a location from which activities spread or are concentrated (e.g., 「東京を中心に」 - mainly in Tokyo).\n*   **Main Subject or Topic:** Indicating the primary theme of a discussion, study, or project (e.g., 「環境問題を中心に」 - focused on environmental issues).\n*   **Key Figure or Group:** Highlighting the most important person or group within an organization or movement (e.g., 「リーダーを中心に」 - with the leader at the helm).\n*   **Main Component or Element:** Specifying the main ingredient or core principle of something (e.g., 「野菜を中心に」 - mainly vegetables).\n\nVariations of 「を中心に」 include 「を中心とする」 and 「を中心とした」, which function as attributive phrases to modify a subsequent noun, meaning \"(something) centered around (Noun)\" or \"(something) with (Noun) as its focus\". For example, 「環境問題を中心とするプロジェクト」 means \"a project centered around environmental issues\". The form 「を中心として」 acts adverbially, meaning \"with (Noun) as the core\" or \"taking (Noun) as the basis\" for an action.\n\nWhile 「を中心に」 generally uses the particle に, you might occasionally encounter 「を中心と」. The use of 「と」 can sometimes emphasize a more conclusive or decisive focus, whereas 「に」 often implies a progressive or ongoing centering. However, in many contexts, their meanings are quite similar and interchangeable.",

            "meaning": "Mainly, primarily",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「主に」 also means \"mainly\" or \"primarily\", it functions as an adverb and is more general. 「を中心に」, on the other hand, explicitly implies a 'center' or 'core' around which something revolves or is focused. It highlights the central element itself, rather than just indicating the largest proportion or most frequent occurrence."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing 「を中心に」 from 「主に」, remember that 「を中心に」 emphasizes the central or core element, suggesting a foundational or organizing principle. 「主に」 simply denotes that something is the main or most significant part without necessarily implying a 'center' from which things radiate or are organized.",
