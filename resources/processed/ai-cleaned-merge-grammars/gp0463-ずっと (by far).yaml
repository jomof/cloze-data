    "writeup": "In addition to meaning \"always\" or \"non-stop,\" ずっと can also express that one thing is \"by far (A)\" or \"much more (A)\" than something else. Typically, ずっと appears at the beginning of the sentence, preceding the comparison between (A) and (B).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   While ずっと as \"ever since\" or \"always\" may seem different from ずっと as \"way more\" or \"by far,\" the literal meaning remains the same. In all cases, ずっと emphasizes \"an extremely big interval\" or degree.",
    "etymology": "The etymology of ずっと comes from the idea of something continuing or being in a state for a long duration. This sense of extended duration is what gives it the comparative meaning of 'by far' or 'much more,' as it emphasizes a significant difference or degree.",
