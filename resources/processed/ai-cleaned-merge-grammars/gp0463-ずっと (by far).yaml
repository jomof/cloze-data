    "etymology": "「ずっと」 originally meant continuously or for a long duration. Its use to mean 'by far' is a semantic extension, indicating a significant difference or interval between two things.",
    "writeup": "In addition to meaning \"always\" or \"non-stop,\" 「ずっと」 can also convey that one thing is \"by far (A)\" or \"much more (A)\" than something else. In these cases, 「ずっと」 usually appears at the beginning of the sentence, before the comparison between (A) and (B) is made. The literal meaning of 「ずっと」 highlights \"an extremely big interval\".",
