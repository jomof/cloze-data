        "ずっと + Comparative Phrase (e.g., noun より adjective)": "Emphasizes a significant difference in degree or quality between two things or states.",
        "ずっと + Adjective/Adverb (e.g., ずっと大きい、ずっと早く)": "Indicates a considerably greater extent or intensity."

        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Used to emphasize a significant difference when making a comparison. Can be used in both informal and formal contexts, though its directness often lends itself to casual speech. It can also appear in more formal settings, particularly in objective comparisons."
    },
    "etymology": "Originally, 「ずっと」 conveyed the idea of continuity, stretching in time or space, meaning 'all the way,' 'continuously,' or 'always.' This sense of 'an extremely big interval' naturally extended to expressing a large difference in comparison. If a quality extends 'all the way' or 'continuously' beyond another, it is 'by far' superior or different.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「ずっと」 serves to emphasize a considerable difference when comparing two items, qualities, or states. While 「ずっと」 also means 'always' or 'continuously' (referring to duration), this usage focuses on the **degree** of difference, indicating that something is 'by far,' 'much more,' or 'way' different than something else. It highlights a significant gap or disparity.\n\nWhen used for comparison, 「ずっと」 typically precedes the adjective or adverb that describes the quality being compared, often appearing in structures like 「A は B より ずっと (adjective/adverb)」 (A is *much more* [adjective/adverb] than B). It can also modify single adjectives or adverbs to intensify their meaning, indicating a significantly greater extent.\n\nDespite its seemingly different meanings, both 'continuous' and 'by far' usages of 「ずっと」 stem from the core concept of an 'extremely large interval' – whether that interval is in time, space, or a comparative scale.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike this usage of 「ずっと」 which expresses a large comparative difference, 「ずっと ①」 refers to duration, continuity, or a long stretch of time or distance. For example, 「ずっと待っていた」 (I was waiting the whole time) vs. 「ずっと高い」 (much taller)."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「はるかに」 is very similar to 「ずっと」 in conveying a significant difference. While often interchangeable, 「はるかに」 can sometimes carry a slightly more formal or literary tone compared to the more commonly used and versatile 「ずっと」, especially in everyday conversation."

            "nuance": "「とても」 expresses a high degree of an absolute quality (e.g., とてもおいしい - very delicious), but it does not inherently imply a *comparison* or a *degree of difference* between two things in the way 「ずっと」 does. 「ずっと」 is used when you want to say something is 'much more X than Y'."

            "nuance": "Similar to 「とても」, 「すごく」 emphasizes an absolute degree of a quality. While 「すごくいい」 means 'really good', it doesn't convey 'much better than something else' like 「ずっといい」 does in a comparative context. It is generally more casual than 「とても」."

            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "「かなり」 indicates a noticeable or considerable amount, but the degree of difference it implies is generally less emphatic or extreme than that conveyed by 「ずっと」. 「ずっと」 suggests a *far* greater disparity, making it stronger for emphasizing large differences."

            "meaning": "More",
            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "「もっと」 means 'more' (e.g., もっと大きい - bigger). While it implies an increase, it doesn't carry the strong emphasis of 'by far' or 'much more' that 「ずっと」 does, which stresses a substantial or overwhelming difference."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To distinguish between 「ずっと」 and similar adverbs, consider whether you are emphasizing an absolute degree of a quality (like 「とても」 or 「すごく」), a moderate degree (like 「かなり」), a simple increase (like 「もっと」), or a significant, often overwhelming, comparative difference (like 「ずっと」 and 「はるかに」). Choose 「ずっと」 when you want to highlight a large gap or superiority in a comparison.",
