        "[clause describing the noun] + noun": "Modifies a noun by providing additional descriptive information about it."

    "meaning": "A clause that modifies a noun by providing additional descriptive information about it.",
    "details": {
        "Function": "A relative clause acts as an adjective, providing more information about a noun.",
        "Structure": "A relative clause precedes the noun it modifies. The clause can be a simple phrase or a complex sentence.",
        "Word Order": "Japanese word order is flexible, but typically the relative clause comes directly before the noun it describes."
    },
    "etymology": "The concept of a 'relative clause' is a grammatical term borrowed from Western linguistics. The Japanese language incorporates this concept by embedding clauses directly before the nouns they modify, without the need for relative pronouns like 'which' or 'that' as in English. This inherent structure is a core feature of Japanese sentence construction.",
    "writeup": "A relative clause in Japanese functions much like an adjective phrase in English, providing additional information about a noun. The relative clause *always* precedes the noun it modifies. Unlike English, Japanese does not use relative pronouns such as \"which,\" \"that,\" or \"who\" to introduce the relative clause. Instead, the entire clause is placed directly before the noun it describes. This grammatical structure is fundamental to creating complex and nuanced sentences in Japanese. Think of it as embedding a descriptive sentence directly into another sentence to provide context or detail about a particular noun.",
