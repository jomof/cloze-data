    "meaning": "A clause that modifies a noun.",
    "details": {
        "Function": "To provide additional descriptive information about a noun.",
        "Structure": "A relative clause consists of a subject, verb, and optional objects or adverbs, just like a regular sentence. It precedes the noun it modifies.",
        "Tense": "The tense of the verb in the relative clause determines when the action or state occurred relative to the main clause.",
        "Word Order": "The word order within the relative clause is generally the same as in a regular Japanese sentence (Subject-Object-Verb).",
        "Omission": "In certain cases, particles like 「が」 or 「を」 can be omitted within the relative clause for brevity."
    },
    "etymology": "The concept of relative clauses is universal across languages, but its expression in Japanese involves embedding a clause before the noun it modifies. This structure reflects the head-final nature of Japanese syntax, where the main element (the head noun) comes at the end of the phrase.",
    "writeup": "Relative clauses in Japanese function similarly to adjective clauses in English, providing additional information about a noun. The entire clause precedes the noun it modifies. Think of it as embedding a sentence inside another sentence to add detail. The basic structure is: [Clause] + Noun. For example, 「私が作ったケーキ」 means \"the cake that I made\".\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   The tense within the relative clause indicates the timing of the action relative to the main clause. 「昨日買った本」 means \"the book I bought yesterday.\"\n*   Particles within the relative clause can sometimes be omitted, especially 「が」 and 「を」.\n*   Relative clauses are essential for expressing complex ideas and descriptions in Japanese.",
