        "言わば": "Used to introduce a metaphorical or analogous explanation.",

        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used to introduce a rephrasing or comparison that isn't literally true, but helps to explain or understand the main point.",
        "function": "To signal that you are about to use an analogy, metaphor, or approximation."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 言わば comes from the verb 言う (iu, to say). 言わば is a hypothetical or conditional form of saying something, implying \"if I were to say it.\" Thus, it suggests that the speaker is offering a way of expressing something that is not necessarily exact but helps convey the idea.",
    "writeup": "**言わば (iwaba)** is an adverb that translates to \"so to speak,\" \"as it were,\" \"like,\" or \"sort of.\" It's used to introduce a metaphorical or analogous explanation of something, indicating that the comparison isn't literal but helps to illustrate the point. Think of it as a way to say, \"If I had to put it another way...\" or \"It's kind of like...\". This expression is often used to clarify or add emphasis to a description by presenting it through an analogy or a figurative statement. It acknowledges that the statement is not literally true but is a useful comparison to convey a deeper understanding.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies a more deliberate and considered comparison, where 言わば emphasizes the speaker's framing of the analogy, rather than a simple casual observation with みたい."
