    "writeup": "The Japanese verb 「くれる」 (kureru) is similar to 「与える」 (ataeru, to bestow). 「くれる」 (usually written in hiragana) indicates that something is \"bestowed to the speaker\" (or someone within the speaker's inner circle). In this way, 「てくれる」 is the opposite of 「てあげる」, which means someone (usually the speaker) gives (an action) to someone outside of their inner circle. 「てくれる」 is commonly translated as \"someone did (A) for me.\" When asking for a favor, 「てくれる」 can be shortened to 「てくれ」. However, this is very casual and should not be used with strangers or those you don't know well. Think of 「てくれ」 as similar to saying \"would ya do (A)\" in English.\n\nImportant points:\n*   「てくれる」 indicates the giver is doing something for the **benefit** of the receiver.\n*   It expresses gratitude or appreciation.\n*   It can also be used to ask someone to do something for you (more polite alternatives exist).\n*   Using 「てくれ」 is **very casual**.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Understanding the benefactive verbs in Japanese can be challenging. The key is to always consider the perspective of the speaker and the recipient of the action. If the action benefits the speaker or their inner circle, you are likely looking for 「くれる」 or 「てくれる」. If the action benefits someone outside your inner circle, you would use 「あげる」 or 「てあげる」. If you are receiving an action, regardless of who is giving it, 「もらう」 or 「てもらう」 is generally used, with 「いただく」 or 「ていただく」 for humble contexts.
