    "writeup": "**Kekkou** (結構) is a versatile word with multiple uses. Primarily, it is used as an adverb meaning \"quite,\" \"fairly,\" or \"rather.\" For instance, 「結構大きい」 (kekkou ookii) translates to \"quite big.\" It is also frequently used as a polite way to decline an offer, similar to \"no, thank you\" or \"I'm fine\" in English. In this context, it is often accompanied by 「です」 (desu), forming 「結構です」 (kekkou desu). Although it can be written with the kanji 結構, it is also often written in hiragana as けっこう, especially in informal situations or for improved readability.",

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Both 「結構」 and 「なかなか」 convey a sense of \"quite\" or \"to some extent,\" but their nuances differ. **Kekkou** (結構) tends to express the objective state or degree of something being sufficient or better than expected. For example, 「結構高い」 (kekkou takai) simply means \"quite expensive.\" On the other hand, **nakanaka** (なかなか) often carries a subjective nuance, suggesting that something is better than anticipated or requires effort to achieve. For instance, 「なかなか良い」 (nakanaka yoi) can mean \"surprisingly good\" or \"not bad at all,\" while 「なかなか来ない」 (nakanaka konai) means \"it won't come easily\" or \"it's taking a long time to come.\" As for 「十分」 (juubun), it strictly means \"enough\" or \"sufficient.\" While 「結構です」 can politely decline by implying sufficiency, 「十分です」 is a more direct and objective statement of having enough, lacking the nuanced politeness or the sense of 'quite' as an intensifier that 「結構」 carries.

Using just 「結構です」 is a common direct, polite refusal. Adding 「ありがとう」 expresses gratitude along with the refusal. The phrase 「もう結構」 indicates that one has already had enough. 「お構いなく」 emphasizes not wanting to bother the host. 「恐れ入りますが」 is a very formal and humble way to preface a refusal."
