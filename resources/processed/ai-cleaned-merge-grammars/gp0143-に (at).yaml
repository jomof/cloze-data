    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 marks a specific point in time when something happens. Think of it as pinpointing an exact moment. It's used with times, dates, days of the week, and specific events. **Important:** You generally can't use 「に」 with time words that aren't specific, like 「今日」 (today), 「明日」 (tomorrow), or 「最近」 (recently). These words don't refer to a precise moment that 「に」 can latch onto. For example, you can say 「３時に」 (at 3 o'clock) or 「月曜日に」 (on Monday), but not 「今日に」. Instead, you would just say 「今日」.",
    "etymology": "「に」 is thought to have originated from a word meaning 'place' or 'location.' Over time, its usage expanded to include points in time as well.",
