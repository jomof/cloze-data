    "etymology": "This grammar point combines a verb in the past or continuous form (た or ている) with a noun. This structure creates a relative clause, where the verb modifies or describes the noun.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, to describe something or someone that is performing an action, you can use a relative clause. This combines two phrases into one sentence. Typically, the た (plain-past) or ている (continuous) form of verbs are used.\n\nFor example, instead of saying \"Takashi-san is a man. He lives in Tokyo,\" you can say \"Takashi-san is a man *who lives* in Tokyo\".\n\nUnlike English, which uses words like \"that\" or \"which,\" Japanese simply attaches the verb phrase directly to the noun. It's crucial to remember that the ます (polite) forms of verbs are not used in relative clauses.",
