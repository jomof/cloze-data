    "etymology": "This construction arises from the fundamental structure of Japanese clauses, where modifiers precede the nouns they modify. The 「た」 form indicates the completion of an action, while 「ている」 indicates a continuous or ongoing action. Combining these verb forms directly before a noun creates a relative clause, specifying the state or action associated with that noun. It's a core concept for building more complex sentences by embedding clauses to provide additional information about a noun.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point covers how to modify nouns with verbs using relative clauses. In English, we often use words like \"that\" or \"which\" to connect a verb to a noun. However, in Japanese, you simply place the verb in its 「た」 (past) or 「ている」 (continuous) form directly before the noun it modifies.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n*   The 「た」 form indicates a completed action. For example, 「食べたパン」 (tabeta pan) means \"the bread that was eaten\".\n*   The 「ている」 form indicates an ongoing action or state. For example, 「走っている犬」 (hashitteiru inu) means \"the dog that is running\".\n*   You should not use the polite 「ます」 form in relative clauses.",
