    "etymology": "The grammar point 「んとする」 is derived from the verb 「する」 (to do) and the grammatical particle 「ん」, which is a contraction of 「～よう」, indicating intention or attempt. Thus, it literally means \"to try to do.\"",

It's often used in formal writing and speech to describe a situation or convey a particular feeling. The verb 「する」 becomes 「せん」 when used with this grammar point, so it's 「せんとする」. \n\n*   **Formal Usage:** Commonly found in literature, news reports, and formal speeches.\n*   **Expressing Imminence:** Captures the sense of something being just about to occur.\n*Note: there is a related expression, 「ようとする」, which has a similar meaning.",
