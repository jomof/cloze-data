        "usage-context": "Describes an action about to happen or someone's intention to do something. Often used to depict a situation or feeling.",
        "nuance": "This grammar point carries a formal, often literary nuance, suggesting a strong sense of imminence or a determined effort. It is frequently encountered in written works, news reports, and formal speeches. While it can overlap with 「ようとする」 in meaning, 「んとする」 tends to convey a more decisive or critical moment, or a more profound intention. The 'about to' sense implies being right at the edge of an event, often dramatic or significant. The 'try to' sense implies a strong, deliberate effort or aspiration."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「んとする」 is derived from the verb 「する」 (to do) and the grammatical particle 「ん」, which is a contraction of 「～よう」, indicating intention or attempt. Thus, it literally means \"to try to do.\" The usage is generally formal or literary, contrasting with more common expressions like 「ようとする」.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「んとする」 is used to express that something is **on the verge of happening** or that someone is **trying to do something**. It's commonly found in literature, news reports, and formal speeches, making it suitable for academic or official contexts.\n\nWhen 「んとする」 expresses imminence, it captures the sense of something being just about to occur, often highlighting a crucial or dramatic moment. For example, a speaker might use it to describe an impending natural disaster or a significant historical event.\n\nWhen expressing intention, 「んとする」 conveys a determined or strong effort to achieve something. This usage implies a deliberate aspiration rather than a casual attempt.\n\nA key point of formation is that for the verb 「する」 (to do), it conjugates irregularly to 「せんとする」, not 「しんとする」.\n\nWhile there is a related expression, 「ようとする」, which shares a similar meaning, 「んとする」 often carries a more formal or literary tone and can imply a greater sense of gravity or decisiveness.",
