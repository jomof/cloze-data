        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "Generally used with a limited set of antonymous い-adjectives to express that the outcome is consistent despite two opposing conditions. It carries a somewhat formal or literary tone. The phrase is often used when discussing universal truths or inevitable outcomes."
    },
    "etymology": "The structure 「かれ〜かれ」 originally comes from a contraction of the conjunctive stem of い-adjectives (く) and the imperative form of the verb 「ある」 (to be), which is 「あれ」. Thus, 「かれ〜かれ」 literally means something like \"be it (A) or (B)\". This form evolved to fill the role of an imperative for い-adjectives, which do not have their own imperative form.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「かれ〜かれ」 is used with opposite い-adjectives to convey that whether (A) or (B), the result will be the same. It is usually translated as \"or\" or \"either (A) or (B)\". As it originates from an imperative form, the literal meaning is simply \"be it (A) or (B)\", acting as a declaration that the outcome remains consistent regardless of the specific condition. It attaches to the stems of two antonymous adjectives.\n\n「かれ〜かれ」 is used with a limited set of adjectives. For instance, in the case of 「良い」 (good) and 「悪い」 (bad), 「悪い」 will be read as 「悪しかれ」, which comes from the archaic 「悪し」 (bad). This particular phrasing, 「良かれ悪しかれ」, is considered a set phrase in modern Japanese.",
