        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Generally used with a limited set of antonymous い-adjectives to express that the outcome is consistent despite two opposing conditions. It carries a somewhat formal or literary tone. The phrase is often used when discussing universal truths or inevitable outcomes.",
        "function": "To express that a situation or outcome remains constant, irrespective of two contrasting conditions or states.",
        "nuance": "Carries a declarative, somewhat literary or philosophical tone. It emphasizes the inevitability or universal truth of a statement rather than merely presenting alternatives. Often used in discussions about inherent qualities or unavoidable realities. It's not commonly used in everyday casual conversation.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions adverbially, modifying the main clause to establish the conditions under which the statement holds true."
    },
    "etymology": "The structure 「かれ〜かれ」 originally comes from a contraction of the conjunctive stem of い-adjectives (く) and the imperative form of the verb 「ある」 (to be), which is 「あれ」. Thus, 「かれ〜かれ」 literally means something like \"be it (A) or (B)\". This form evolved to fill the role of an imperative for い-adjectives, which do not have their own imperative form.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「かれ〜かれ」 is used with opposite い-adjectives to convey that whether (A) or (B), the result will be the same. It is usually translated as \"or\" or \"either (A) or (B)\". As it originates from an imperative form, the literal meaning is simply \"be it (A) or (B)\", acting as a declaration that the outcome remains consistent regardless of the specific condition. It attaches to the stems of two antonymous adjectives.\n\n「かれ〜かれ」 is used with a limited set of adjectives. For instance, in the case of 「良い」 (good) and 「悪い」 (bad), 「悪い」 will be read as 「悪しかれ」, which comes from the archaic 「悪し」 (bad). This particular phrasing, 「良かれ悪しかれ」, is considered a set phrase in modern Japanese. While understood, this expression carries a somewhat archaic or literary nuance, making it less common in everyday spoken Japanese compared to more direct conditional forms like ～ても or ～か～か. It is best to use it with established pairs like those found in the examples, rather than attempting to form new combinations.",

            "nuance": "This conditional form simply states that an action or state occurs regardless of two conditions. In contrast, 「かれ～かれ」 implies an inherent quality or an inevitable outcome irrespective of the two opposing states, often carrying a more formal or literary nuance."

It often implies a deeper, more inherent truth about a situation rather than just listing possibilities or conditions.

This is common in casual, intimate discussions where the speaker expresses a firm belief about the outcome, even if they don't wish for it.
