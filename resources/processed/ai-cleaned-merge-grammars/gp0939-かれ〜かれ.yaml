    "etymology": "The structure 「かれ〜かれ」 originally comes from a contraction of the conjunctive stem of い-adjectives (く) and the imperative form of the verb 「ある」 (to be), which is 「あれ」. So 「かれ〜かれ」 literally means something like \"be it (A) or (B)\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「かれ〜かれ」 is used with opposite い-adjectives to convey that whether (A) or (B), the result will be the same. It is usually translated as \"or\" or \"either (A) or (B)\". As it originates from an imperative form, the literal meaning is simply \"be it (A) or (B)\", acting as a declaration that the outcome remains consistent regardless of the specific condition. It attaches to the stems of two antonymous adjectives. 「かれ〜かれ」 is used with a limited set of adjectives.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n\n*   In the case of 「良い」 (good) and 「悪い」 (bad), 「悪い」 will be read as 「悪しかれ」, which comes from the archaic 「悪し」 (bad). This is considered a set phrase in modern Japanese.",
