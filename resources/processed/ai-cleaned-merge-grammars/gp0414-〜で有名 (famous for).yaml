    "writeup": "The grammar point \"Noun/Adjective + は + 〜で有名\" is used to express that something or someone is **famous for** a particular quality, characteristic, or reason. The \"は\" particle marks the topic. \"で\" indicates the reason or cause for the fame. \"有名\" itself is a noun that functions as a *na*-adjective, meaning \"famous\" or \"well-known.\" This pattern is quite versatile and frequently used to describe the defining characteristics of places, people, or things. Note that when the reason for fame is a phrase or clause, it is often followed by \"こと\" (or \"の\"), which nominalizes the preceding expression, allowing \"で\" to attach.",
