    "etymology": "「至る (itaru)」 means \"to arrive\" or \"to reach.\" The addition of 「まで (made)」 extends this to mean \"up to\" or \"until,\" creating a phrase that signifies reaching a certain limit or extent. The combination emphasizes the range or scope of something.",
    "writeup": "「に至るまで」 is used to indicate a wide range or extent, meaning \"everything from A to B,\" or \"from A up until B.\" It emphasizes that the scope includes everything between the two points mentioned. It often implies that the range is unexpectedly broad or comprehensive. This expression is similar to 「から...まで」, but 「に至るまで」 often carries a stronger sense of completeness or unexpectedness. It is often used in formal writing and speech.",
