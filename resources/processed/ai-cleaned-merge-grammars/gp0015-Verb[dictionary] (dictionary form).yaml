etymology: The concept of 'dictionary form' (辞書形 - jishokei) reflects its primary use as the entry form
  found in Japanese dictionaries. Historically, Japanese verbs had various endings depending on their
  function (e.g., conclusive, attributive, imperative). The modern 'dictionary form' consolidates what
  were often different forms in classical Japanese into a single base form from which most contemporary
  conjugations are derived. Its 'plain' nature stems from this historical usage as a foundational, non-polite
  verbal ending.
writeup: 'The dictionary form, or 辞書形 (jishokei), is the fundamental, non-past, plain form of a Japanese
  verb. It is the form you will find when looking up verbs in a dictionary, hence its name. This form
  is inherently casual and is used when speaking with friends, family, or in informal settings. It serves
  as the base from which almost all other verb conjugations are derived, making its mastery essential
  for further grammatical development. Understanding the dictionary form is crucial for conjugating verbs
  into polite forms (like the -masu form), past tense, negative forms, and many other grammatical patterns.
  While called ''non-past,'' its usage can refer to future actions or general truths, depending on context.
  For instance, 「食べる」 (taberu) can mean ''to eat'' (general action), ''will eat'' (future action), or
  ''eats'' (habitual action). The formation varies slightly depending on the verb group: Group 1 Verbs
  (Godan verbs): These verbs end in a 「う」 sound. For example, 買う (kau - to buy), 話す (hanasu - to speak),
  待つ (matsu - to wait), 死ぬ (shinu - to die), 呼ぶ (yobu - to call), 飲む (nomu - to drink), 書く (kaku - to
  write), 泳ぐ (oyogu - to swim), 帰る (kaeru - to return). Group 2 Verbs (Ichidan verbs): These verbs always
  end in 「る」 (ru) preceded by an ''e'' sound or ''i'' sound. For example, 食べる (taberu - to eat), 見る (miru
  - to see), 寝る (neru - to sleep). Irregular Verbs: There are only two truly irregular verbs: する (suru
  - to do) and くる (kuru - to come), which have unique dictionary forms.'

  - term: Verb[ます] (polite present)
    meaning: The polite non-past form of a verb.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The dictionary form is casual and plain, while the -masu form is polite and appropriate for
      most formal situations or when speaking to strangers or superiors.
    grammar_point: Verb[ます] (polite present)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both the dictionary form and the -masu form are non-past, their primary
  distinction lies in their level of politeness. The dictionary form conveys a direct, casual tone, suitable
  for informal conversations or when explicitly stating facts. The -masu form, on the other hand, adds
  a layer of politeness, making it appropriate for more formal settings, speaking to elders, or when you
  want to show respect.

post_example_writeup: The examples demonstrate how the dictionary form serves as a versatile base in Japanese.
  It appears naturally in casual conversation, for general statements, and in combination with other grammatical
  patterns to express various nuances like ability, desire, or intent. Pay close attention to its usage
  in more formal instructional contexts or when modifying nouns, as these are common patterns where the
  plain form is essential.
