formation:
  Ichidan verbs (e.g., 食べる, 見る): Verb Stem + る (e.g., 食べ + る, 見 + る)
  Godan verbs (e.g., 買う, 書く, 泳ぐ, 話す, 立つ, 死ぬ, 遊ぶ, 読む, 帰る): The final kana of the verb stem changes according
    to the 'u' column of its corresponding kana row (e.g., 買う, 書く, 泳ぐ, 話す, 立つ, 死ぬ, 遊ぶ, 読む, 帰る).
  Irregular verbs (e.g., する, くる): 'Specific forms: する becomes する, くる becomes くる.'
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used as the basic, unconjugated form of a verb. It serves as the base for many other
    conjugations and is commonly found in dictionaries, hence its name. It can denote habitual action,
    general truths, or future intentions.
  function: To indicate a verb's fundamental meaning without specifying politeness level or specific tense,
    serving as the linguistic root.
  nuance: The dictionary form is considered the 'plain' or 'casual' form, appropriate for informal conversation,
    internal monologues, or as a component of larger grammatical structures. It stands in contrast to
    polite forms and formal conjugations.
  counterpoint: Contrasts with polite forms (e.g., ます form) and formal conjugations. It is distinct from
    the stem or te-form in its grammatical function.
  colocation: Often followed by particles like 「の」, 「こと」, or 「ばかり」 to form nominalized clauses or specific
    grammatical patterns. Can be directly followed by explanatory particle 「の」 (のだ/んです) or used in conditional
    clauses.
  grammatical-role: Functions as the base form for all verb conjugations, appearing as the primary entry
    in dictionaries. Used in plain speech for non-past statements, relative clauses, and as a component
    in various compound structures.
  logical-flow: Serves as the foundational element from which logical extensions of tense, mood, and politeness
    are built. Represents the core action or state.
  temporal-flow: Typically denotes non-past actions or states, including habitual actions, future plans,
    or general truths, unless combined with other grammatical elements to indicate past tense.
  spatial-flow: Not directly related to spatial flow, but the action described by the verb may occur in
    a specific space or direction, as indicated by accompanying particles or context (e.g., 行く implying
    movement towards a location). However, the dictionary form itself does not inherently dictate spatial
    flow.
etymology: The term 「辞書形 (jishokei)」 literally means 'dictionary form,' reflecting its role as the entry
  form for verbs in Japanese dictionaries. Japanese verbs are broadly categorized into Ichidan verbs (一段動詞,
  'one-level verbs,' often called る-verbs because they typically end in る and have a simple conjugation
  pattern where only the final る changes) and Godan verbs (五段動詞, 'five-level verbs,' often called う-verbs
  as their conjugations involve shifts across the five vowels of a kana row). Understanding these classifications
  is crucial as the dictionary form serves as the foundation from which all other conjugations are derived,
  each following the specific patterns of its verb type.
writeup: |-
  The dictionary form (辞書形) is the fundamental, non-past form of all Japanese verbs, serving as the base from which all other conjugations are derived. It's the form you'll find when you look up a verb in a dictionary, hence its name. It is also commonly referred to as the 'plain form,' 'short form,' or 'casual form' because of its frequent use in informal conversation, internal thoughts, and when constructing more complex grammatical patterns.

  Japanese verbs are primarily divided into two main groups based on their conjugation patterns: Ichidan verbs (一段動詞), often informally called 'る-verbs,' and Godan verbs (五段動詞), often called 'う-verbs,' along with a couple of irregular verbs (する and くる).

  *   **Ichidan Verbs (る-verbs):** These verbs are characterized by their stem remaining constant, with only the final 「る」 changing. To form their dictionary form, they typically end in 「る」 following an 'e' sound (e.g., 食べる - taberu) or an 'i' sound (e.g., 見る - miru). Their conjugation is generally simpler, as you effectively drop the 「る」 and attach various endings.

  *   **Godan Verbs (う-verbs):** These verbs are more diverse in their endings. To form their dictionary form, they end in a kana from the 'u' column of the Japanese syllabary (e.g., 買う - kau, 書く - kaku, 泳ぐ - oyogu). Their conjugations are more complex, as the final kana of the verb stem actually changes across different vowel sounds (the 'five levels' of the Godan system) to attach different endings.

  *   **Irregular Verbs:** The verbs する (suru - to do) and くる (kuru - to come) are irregular and have unique conjugation patterns that do not follow the standard Ichidan or Godan rules.

  The dictionary form is versatile, used for making direct, non-past statements, expressing habitual actions, describing general truths, or stating future intentions in casual speech. It is also a key component when modifying nouns (e.g., 本を読む人 - hon o yomu hito - a person who reads books) and building conditional clauses or nominalized phrases.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[ます] (polite present)
    meaning: Polite non-past form of a verb.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The dictionary form is the plain, casual base form, while the 「ます」 form is its polite counterpart
      used in formal or respectful conversation. They express the same basic meaning in different registers.
    grammar_point: Verb[ます] (polite present)
  - term: Verb[た] (past tense)
    meaning: Plain past form of a verb.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The dictionary form expresses non-past (present or future) actions or general truths, whereas
      the 「た」 form specifically denotes past actions or completed states. Both are plain forms, differing
      only in tense.
    grammar_point: Verb[た] (past tense)
  - term: Verb[て] (and then)
    meaning: And, then (linking events)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While the te-form connects actions or states, the dictionary form is the base, unconjugated
      form of a verb. The te-form indicates sequence, means, or a continuous state when combined with
      「いる」, whereas the dictionary form states the verb's basic meaning.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] (and then)
  - term: 見える
    meaning: To be visible, to appear
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「見える」 is an intransitive verb meaning 'to be visible' or 'to appear naturally,' distinct from
      the potential form of 見る (to see), which is 「見られる」 or its casual contraction 「見れる」. The dictionary
      form of the verb 'to see' is 「見る」, whereas 「見える」 is a separate verb.
    grammar_point: 見える (to be visible・to seem)
post_false_friends_writeup: When working with Japanese verbs, it's essential to recognize the dictionary
  form as the fundamental base. While other forms like the 「ます」 form (polite present) and 「た」 form (plain
  past) convey similar meanings in different tenses or registers, they are still conjugations of this
  base. The te-form is used for connecting clauses or indicating continuous actions, which is a grammatical
  function distinct from the dictionary form's role as the verb's citation and plain non-past form. Additionally,
  be cautious not to confuse a verb's dictionary form with other verbs that might sound or look similar,
  such as the active verb 「見る」 (to see) and the naturally occurring state 「見える」 (to be visible). Paying
  attention to these distinctions will greatly improve your accuracy in using Japanese verbs.

          - 明日 映画 を {見る} でしょう。
        english: I'll probably watch a movie tomorrow.
        hint: The casual register and direct statement imply a plain, certain future action suitable for
          the dictionary form, avoiding speculative nuances.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 映画 を {見 たい} です。
        english: I want to watch a movie tomorrow.
        hint: The scene focuses on a plan, not a desire, guiding the user towards a direct statement of
          future action rather than a wish.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日、映画 に {行く}。
        english: I'll go to a movie tomorrow.
        hint: This is about *watching* a movie, not just *going* to the cinema. Focus on the action of

          - 明日、映画 を {見る} つもり です。
        english: I intend to watch a movie tomorrow.
        hint: The original is a direct statement of a future action. 「～つもり です」 indicates a specific intention
          or plan.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日、映画 が {見え ます}。
        english: A movie is visible tomorrow.
        hint: The original expresses an active intention to watch. 「見えます」 implies something is naturally

          habit without specific intimate context, steering away from the plain form.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 毎日、ご飯 を {食べ} て いる。
        english: I am eating/have been eating rice every day (habitual state).

      - competing_japanese:
          - 毎日、パン を {買い} ます。
        english: I buy bread every day.
        hint: 「買う」 (kau) is an う-verb, and its polite form is 「買います」. This conjugation pattern is different

          - 彼 は 日本 語 を {覚え} て いる。
        english: He has memorized Japanese (state of having memorized).

        hint: The polite 「ましたか」 indicates a polite inquiry, suitable for a more formal or less intimate
          conversation than the plain form.
    scene: A woman reminding a man about something they discussed.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The polite past interrogative 「忘れましたか」 is used by a female speaker to a male listener, indicating
      a respectful yet direct inquiry. This phrasing is polite and appropriate for a semi-formal or respectful

      - competing_japanese:
          - シャワー を {浴びる} と、さっぱり し ます。
        english: When I take a shower, I feel refreshed (general condition).

        english: I took a shower. And then I felt refreshed.
        hint: The te-form 「～て」 is used to smoothly connect sequential actions or states, implying a closer
          relationship than simply listing actions with conjunctions like 「そして」. We are looking for the
          te-form.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: te-form (～て)

  is the base, its conjugations will vary depending on the verb type. Pay close attention to how each
  conjugation modifies the meaning and the social context of the sentence.
