    "etymology": "The particle 「は」originated from the conditional particle 「ば」. Over time, 「は」evolved to mark the topic of a sentence, indicating what the speaker is talking about. The shift from a conditional meaning to a topic marker is related to how speakers introduce a topic as a condition for the rest of the sentence.",
    "writeup": "「は」is a particle that marks the topic of a sentence. It indicates what the sentence is about. It's crucial to understand that 「は」doesn't necessarily indicate the subject; instead, it sets the context for the rest of the sentence. The pronunciation is 「わ」, not 「は」. While both 「は」and 「が」can mark the subject, 「は」is used when the topic is already known or being introduced, whereas 「が」is used to introduce new information or to emphasize the subject.\n\nIt's **important** to note that 「は」can also be used for contrast. This is determined by context and often indicated by placing 「は」in the middle of the sentence. \n\nIn many cases, you can use either 「は」or 「が」, but the nuance will change. 「は」provides a general statement about the topic, while 「が」highlights a specific piece of information.",
