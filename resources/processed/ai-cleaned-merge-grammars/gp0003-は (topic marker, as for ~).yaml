    "etymology": "The particle は originally comes from the conditional marker ば. Over time, は evolved to mark the topic of the sentence, distinguishing it from が, which marks the subject or a specific element.",
    "writeup": "は (pronounced *wa*) is a particle that marks the topic of the sentence. Think of it as saying \"as for...\" or \"speaking of...\". It indicates what the sentence is generally about. It's essential to distinguish は from が, which primarily highlights specific actions or statements. While both can sometimes seem interchangeable, especially in shorter sentences, は broadly describes the overall context, while が emphasizes a particular piece of information.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   は cannot be used to describe things you are seeing or experiencing \"in the moment\". This is because such immediate events are considered part of a larger ongoing experience.\n*   は has two primary functions: marking the topic and indicating contrast or comparison. When は appears in the middle or later part of a sentence, it usually carries a contrasting nuance. Be mindful that this is a general tendency, not a strict rule.\n*   は marks what the speaker assumes is already known or understood by the listener.",
