        "function": "To introduce the topic of a sentence or to create a contrast between two elements.",
        "nuance": "When used to mark a topic, it suggests that the information is generally known or being introduced as the main subject of discussion. When used for contrast, it emphasizes the difference between the marked element and other implied or stated elements.",

        "grammatical-role": "Marks the overarching theme or focus of the sentence."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「は」originated from the conditional particle 「ば」. Historically, 「は」 (as part of the verb conjugation) gradually evolved from marking conditions to introducing a general statement or topic. Its pronunciation also shifted from 'ha' to 'wa' when used as a particle, reflecting a natural sound change in the Japanese language.",
    "writeup": "「は」is one of the most fundamental particles in Japanese, serving primarily as a topic marker. It indicates what the sentence is broadly about, setting the stage for the information that follows. It is crucial to understand that the topic marked by 「は」is not always the grammatical subject of the sentence. For example, in 「東京は人が多いです」(Tokyo has many people), Tokyo is the topic, but 'people' is the subject.\n\nWhile 「は」introduces the topic, it also carries a nuanced function of contrast. When 「は」is used to mark an element that is already implicitly understood or expected, it can imply a contrast with something else. For instance, 「私はビールは飲みますが、ワインは飲みません」(I drink beer, but I don't drink wine) uses 「は」to explicitly draw a contrast between beer and wine.\n\n**Key Differences with 「が」:**\n「は」and 「が」are often confused, but their core functions differ. 「は」marks existing information or general statements, implying the topic is already known or being introduced as a general theme. In contrast, 「が」identifies the specific subject of an action or state, often highlighting new information or emphasizing the subject directly. For example, 「雨が降っています」(It is raining) uses 「が」because 'rain' is new information, whereas 「今日は雨です」(Today is rain) uses 「は」because 'today' is the general topic.\n\n**Pronunciation Note:**\nWhen used as a particle, 「は」is always pronounced 「わ」, not 「は」. This is a common point of confusion for learners and a key indicator of its function.",
