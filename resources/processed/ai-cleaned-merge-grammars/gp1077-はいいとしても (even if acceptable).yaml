details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  nuance: Expresses a qualified acceptance, where one aspect is conceded while another is questioned or
    opposed. It implies that the first point is either genuinely acceptable or tolerated for the sake
    of argument, but the second point is a significant drawback or problem that cannot be overlooked.
  grammatical-role: Conjunction-like phrase
  logical-flow: Establishes a point of agreement or concession before introducing a contrasting, problematic
    point.
  temporal-flow: Indicates a concession that holds true at the time of consideration or generally, contrasting
    with a present or ongoing problem.
  spatial-flow: Does not inherently specify spatial flow.
etymology: The phrase 「はいいとしても」 is formed by combining 「は」 (a topic marker indicating contrast or focus),
  「いい」 (an i-adjective meaning 'good' or 'acceptable'), and 「としても」 (a conditional conjunction meaning
  'even if' or 'even though'). Together, they construct a pattern that first acknowledges something as
  acceptable, then introduces a contrasting, unacceptable element. It literally translates to 'even if
  [topic] is good/acceptable'.
writeup: The grammar point 「はいいとしても」 is used to articulate that while one thing is acceptable or granted,
  another aspect is not. It conveys a sense of qualified acceptance, where the speaker acknowledges one
  point but raises an issue with another. This structure is often employed to express a complaint or dissatisfaction,
  where the speaker is willing to concede on one minor point to highlight a more significant problem.
  It is similar to saying "even if...still..." or "granted that..., but...". This grammar point is versatile
  and can be used in various contexts, from casual conversations to more formal discussions. The nuance
  it adds implies that something is 'fine' or 'acceptable', but not fully satisfactory due to the contrasting
  element.
false_friends:
  - term: としても
    meaning: even if; even though; granting that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「はいいとしても」, 「としても」 simply introduces a condition or assumption, without necessarily
      implying that the first part is acceptable while another is not. 「としても」 by itself only sets up the
      premise, whereas 「はいいとしても」 offers a counterpoint, highlighting a conflicting issue.
    grammar_point: としても (even if assumed)
  - term: は仕方がないとしても
    meaning: even if it can't be helped, still...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「はいいとしても」 implies that the first point is acceptable or tolerated, 「は仕方がないとしても」 suggests
      that the first point is an undesirable but unavoidable circumstance that one must accept, but the
      second point is still problematic despite this forced acceptance. It carries a heavier sense of
      resignation regarding the first clause.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:は仕方がないとしても (even if it can't be helped, still...)
  - term: けど
    meaning: but; however; although
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「はいいとしても」, 「けど」 is a simpler, more direct conjunction that expresses contrast or a
      mild concession. It merely connects two clauses, often with a weaker sense of opposition, without
      the nuanced implication of a point being *accepted* or *granted* for the sake of argument before
      a problem is introduced.
    grammar_point: しかし・だが・けれど・しかしながら (but・however)
  - term: はともかく
    meaning: leaving X aside; X is one thing, but Y is another; whether X or not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「はいいとしても」, which explicitly concedes that the first point is 'good' or 'acceptable',
      「はともかく」 implies that the first point is either irrelevant, secondary, or less important, and is
      set aside to focus on the more critical second point. It doesn't necessarily mean the first point
      is *acceptable*, just that it's not the primary concern.
    grammar_point: はともかく (setting aside・leaving aside)
  - term: ながらも
    meaning: Even though; while; despite
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はいいとしても」 implies an acceptance of the first clause's validity, then states a problem with
      the second. 「ながらも」 implies that something is true *despite* a certain condition, often with a nuance
      of difficulty or surprising coexistence. It highlights a contradiction where both aspects exist
      simultaneously, rather than accepting one to complain about another.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem・Adj・Noun]ながら (although・despite)'
  - term: ものの
    meaning: Although, but, even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はいいとしても」 grants the initial point as acceptable before introducing a contrasting negative.
      「ものの」 is a general conjunction indicating concession, like 'although' or 'even though'. It states
      a fact and then presents something contrary or unexpected, without the specific nuance of 'acceptability'
      of the first clause inherent in 「はいいとしても」.
    grammar_point: ものの (although・but)
  - term: とはいえ
    meaning: Though, although (I admit that), be that as it may, nonetheless
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はいいとしても」 states that something is acceptable, but then pivots to a problematic counterpoint.
      「とはいえ」 is used to introduce a statement that slightly contradicts or qualifies the preceding statement,
      often implying 'even though that's true...' or 'having said that...'. It doesn't necessarily imply
      that the first point is 'good' or 'acceptable', but rather a factual concession that is then qualified.
    grammar_point: とはいえ (though)
  - term: にもかかわらず
    meaning: Despite, in spite of, regardless, nevertheless
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「はいいとしても」 concedes a point as acceptable before presenting a problem, 「にもかかわらず」 expresses
      that something happened or is true *despite* a certain condition, emphasizing a lack of influence
      or a surprising outcome. It highlights a stronger opposition or unexpected result than a qualified
      acceptance.
    grammar_point: にもかかわらず (despite)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between these similar expressions, remember that 「はいいとしても」
  explicitly concedes or accepts the first point before introducing the contrasting problem. In contrast,
  「としても」 merely sets up a hypothetical or factual premise without an inherent judgment of 'acceptability'.
  「けど」, on the other hand, is a general conjunction that indicates a simple contrast without the specific
  nuance of concession or reluctant acceptance found in 「はいいとしても」. Meanwhile, 「は仕方がないとしても」 conveys a reluctant
  acceptance of an unavoidable situation, followed by a complaint about a related but still problematic
  aspect. 「はともかく」 implies that the first point is less important or irrelevant and is set aside to emphasize
  the more critical second point, rather than being explicitly 'acceptable'. Other expressions like 「ながらも」
  and 「ものの」 express concession or contrast but lack the explicit 'acceptability' or 'it's fine' nuance
  of 「はいいとしても」. 「とはいえ」 offers a qualification to a preceding statement, similar to 'having said that',
  while 「にもかかわらず」 emphasizes an action or state occurring despite an obstacle, a stronger form of 'despite'
  than the qualified acceptance of 「はいいとしても」.

    scene: A strict manager explaining workplace rules to a new employee. The employee has a history of
      tardiness but has now started not showing up at all without warning.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The phrase 「許されない」 emphasizes the severe and unforgivable nature of the unexcused absence,
      making it clear that while lateness might be tolerated to some extent, absence without notice is
      completely unacceptable in a professional setting. This use of a strong negative conveys the manager's
      firm stance.

    scene: A housemate gently complaining to another about their habits. One housemate is a great cook
      but always leaves a mess.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of 「困る」 expresses a difficulty or nuisance rather than severe anger, indicating a
      common domestic complaint. This phrasing is typical when expressing mild dissatisfaction in an ongoing
      relationship, where one wants to address an issue without being overly confrontational.

    scene: A student looking for an apartment, discussing a potential rental with a friend. They are willing

    register: casual

    nuance: 「耐えられない」 signifies an absolute limit of endurance or tolerance. This strong negative expression
      highlights that while a small room is a minor inconvenience that can be accepted, the lack of a
      window is a fundamental issue that makes the living space unbearable for the speaker.

    register: semi-formal

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The term 「無責任だ」 (irresponsible) is a strong accusation, reflecting the speaker's frustration
      and the violation of an implied duty. This kind of direct, evaluative language is common in a team
      or professional setting where individuals are expected to uphold certain responsibilities.

    scene: A person discussing a friend's unreliable behavior with another mutual friend. They find her
      unpredictability charming sometimes, but her broken promises are a serious issue.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The contrast between 「気まぐれ」 (whimsical/fickle), which can sometimes be seen as endearing,
      and 「約束をすぐ破る」 (breaking promises quickly), which is unequivocally negative, is highlighted by 「はいいとしても」.
      This phrase accurately captures the sentiment of tolerating a personality quirk but finding a breach
      of trust unacceptable. The use of 「問題だ」 reinforces the seriousness of the latter point.

          - 彼 が 学生 で ある の は いい {が}、夜中 に 大声 を 出す の は 迷惑 だ。
        english: Him being a student is fine, but making loud noises in the middle of the night is bothersome.
        hint: This is a direct contrast. We're looking for a phrase that specifically concedes the first
          point as 'acceptable' or 'good' before introducing a more serious issue.
    scene: A resident complaining to their landlord about a noisy student tenant. The landlord understands
      students can be energetic but noise at night is an an issue.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: apologetic
    nuance: The use of 「である」 makes the statement slightly more formal and declarative, which is appropriate
      when making a complaint to a landlord or authority. 「迷惑だ」 (bothersome/annoying) is a common and
      direct way to express a nuisance, particularly when someone's behavior disrupts the peace of others,
      as in this context of noise complaint.

          that the first point is acceptable. We're looking for a phrase that implies the first point
          is 'fine' or 'tolerated'.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: Even if the cost can't be helped, the timeline is too short.

          looking for a phrase that implies the first point is simply 'acceptable' or 'tolerable'.

          - 費用 は いい {けど}、納期 が 短 すぎる。
        english: The cost is fine, but the timeline is too short.
        hint: 「けど」 is a simple contrasting conjunction. We're looking for a phrase that offers a more
          formal concession, implying the first point is accepted for the sake of argument, before introducing
          a problem.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 費用 {は ともかく}、納期 が 短 すぎる。
        english: Leaving aside the cost, the timeline is too short.
        hint: 「はともかく」 suggests setting aside the first point as less important or irrelevant. We're looking
          for a phrase that explicitly concedes the first point as 'acceptable' or 'good'.
    scene: A project manager discussing a new project proposal with their team. The cost fits within the
      budget, but the proposed timeline is unrealistic.

    scene: A parent giving advice to their child before visiting a friend's house. The child insists on
      going, but is reluctant to bring a small gift.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「まずい」 here implies that not bringing anything would be awkward or inappropriate,
      rather than strictly wrong. This aligns with cultural expectations in Japan where bringing a small
      gift (手土産 - temiyage) when visiting someone's home is a common courtesy, particularly in casual
      settings.

      lately, beyond their usual quiet nature.
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「心配だ」 conveys a sense of personal concern and worry for the mutual friend's well-being.
      This example highlights how 「はいいとしても」 can be used to distinguish between an acceptable personality
      trait (being quiet) and a genuinely concerning change in behavior (being unresponsive).

        hint: 「はともかく」 suggests setting aside the first point as less important or irrelevant. We're looking

    scene: A teacher scolding a student for their disrespectful behavior after giving an excuse for missing
      class. The teacher acknowledges the excuse but is more concerned with the student's attitude.
    register: formal
    setting: commanding
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The teacher uses 「許せない」 to express strong disapproval of the student's behavior. The phrase
      「言い訳はいいとしても」 concedes the validity of the excuse for a moment, but immediately pivots to the more
      critical issue of the student's impudent attitude, making the reprimand more impactful. This reflects
      a common dynamic in Japanese educational settings where respect and proper demeanor are highly valued.
post_example_writeup: 「はいいとしても」 implies a conditional acceptance. The speaker concedes a point but introduces
  a contrasting element that requires consideration or criticism. It is a nuanced way to express that
  while one aspect is tolerated, another, often more significant, aspect is problematic.
