jlpt: N3
etymology: The kanji 以前 (いぜん) combine 以 (i), meaning "by means of", "starting from", or "before", and
  前 (zen), meaning "front" or "before". This pairing fundamentally signifies "from a point before" or
  "prior to a certain front/point". This etymology underscores its role in marking a clear temporal or
  sequential boundary. It delineates something that existed or occurred up to that boundary, but implicitly
  not beyond it in the same manner, or from a period preceding it. This deepens the nuance of "before"
  by adding a sense of "from that point onwards, things might be different," distinguishing it from a
  simple chronological marker.
writeup: '**以前 (izen)** is a crucial Japanese word used to denote a time or state that existed "before"
  a particular event, period, or condition, or to refer to something as "former" or "previous". While
  it shares some overlap with simpler temporal markers like まえに, 以前 carries a more formal tone and often
  implies a significant shift or contrast between the past and the present. It delineates a clear boundary
  in time, often suggesting that circumstances have changed since that point. You will primarily encounter
  以前 in the following grammatical patterns: *   **[Noun] + 以前**: This construction is used to specify
  a time **before** the noun it modifies. For example, 「第二次世界大戦 {以前}」 (Dainiji Sekai Taisen {izen}) means
  "before World War II." This is frequently employed in historical discussions or when setting a distinct
  temporal context. It implicitly suggests that the period after the noun is different from the period
  before it. *   **[Verb dictionary form] + 以前**: This pattern indicates a time **before** the action
  described by the verb takes place. For instance, 「出発する {以前} に、全ての準備を終えてください」 (Shuppatsu suru {izen}
  ni, subete no junbi o oete kudasai) translates to "Before departing, please finish all preparations."
  This usage emphasizes a prerequisite or a preceding condition for an action. *   **以前 + の + [Noun]**:
  Here, 以前 acts as a pre-noun adjective meaning "previous" or "former." A common example is 「{以前} の 自分」
  ({izen} no jibun), meaning "my former self" or "me from before." This highlights a past identity, state,
  or possession that is no longer current, often drawing a direct comparison or contrast with the present.
  以前 differs from the more generic まえに in its formality and its strong implication of a distinct preceding
  period, often marked by a change. While まえに can simply indicate chronological order (e.g., 「寝る まえに 歯を磨く」
  - brush teeth before sleeping), 以前 is typically used when the "before" is significant, marking a turning
  point or a past condition that is contrasted with the present. It is widely used across various registers,
  from formal academic writing to everyday conversation, particularly when the speaker wishes to emphasize
  a past state that has undergone transformation.'
false_friends:
  - term: まえに (before・in front)
    meaning: before; in front of (general temporal or spatial)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「以前」 is more formal and often implies a distinct point or period in the past, often with a
      sense of change or contrast to the present. 「まえに」 is a more general term for "before" (temporally)
      or "in front of" (spatially) and doesn't carry the same implication of a changed state.
    grammar_point: まえに (before・in front)
  - term: かつて (formerly, once)
    meaning: formerly, once, in the past
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both refer to the past. 「かつて」 specifically refers to a time long ago or something that happened
      only once, implying a distant or singular past. 「以前」 is more general and can refer to a recent past,
      or a continuous state that existed before a certain point.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:かつて (formerly, once)
  - term: 以前として (as before, still)
    meaning: as before, still, as ever
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While sharing the same root, 「以前として」 is an adverb that means "still" or "as before," indicating
      a continuation of a state from the past to the present, often despite expectations. This is in direct
      contrast to the main use of 「以前」, which marks a point before which something was true, often implying
      a change since then.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:以前として (as before, still)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「以前」 denotes a time or state that existed *before* something, often
  implying a potential change or a clear demarcation of a past period, 「まえに」 is a more neutral and general
  term for chronological 'before' or spatial 'in front of'. It typically lacks the nuanced implication
  of a significant shift that 以前 often carries. 「かつて」, on the other hand, specifically refers to a time
  long ago or something that happened only once in the past, emphasizing a distant or singular historical
  occurrence. It often conjures a sense of nostalgia or a past that is definitively over. In contrast,
  「以前として」, despite sharing the same root kanji, functions as an adverb meaning 'as before' or 'still'.
  This construction indicates a *continuation* of a past state into the present, often against expectations.
  This directly opposes the core implication of change often present with 「以前」. For instance, if you say
  「状況 は 以前 として 悪い」 (Jōkyō wa {izen} to shite warui), it means "The situation is *still* bad," implying
  no improvement, whereas 「状況 は 以前 は 良かった」 (Jōkyō wa {izen} wa yokatta) means "The situation *was* good
  before," implying it's bad now. Understanding these distinctions is key to precise communication of
  temporal relationships and implications in Japanese.
examples:
  - english: Before the incident, everyone was calm.
    japanese:
      - その 事件 {以前} は、皆 落ち着い て い まし た。
      - その 事件 {以前} は、みんな 落ち着い て た。
      - か の 事件 {以前} は、一同 落ち着い て おり まし た。
      - その 事件 {以前} は、関係 者 全員 が 落ち着い て い まし た。
    english_literally: As for that incident before, everyone was calm.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 事件 の まえ に、皆 落ち着い て い まし た。
        english: Before the incident, everyone was calm. (Neutral)
        hint: 「まえに」 is a more general term for 'before' chronologically and lacks the nuance of a distinct
          boundary or implied change that 「以前」 carries. We're looking for a word that can emphasize a
          clear temporal boundary with a potential for contrast.
    scene: A reporter is summarizing the situation before a major event.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「以前」 here marks a clear temporal boundary, implying a significant change in atmosphere
      or situation after the incident occurred.
  - english: My lifestyle was completely different before marriage.
    japanese:
      - 結婚 {以前} は、私 の ライフスタイル は 全く 違い まし た。
      - 結婚 {以前} は、私 の ライフスタイル、全然 違っ た よ。
      - 結婚 {以前} は、俺 の ライフスタイル は まったく 違っ た な。

          - 結婚 する まえ に、私 の ライフスタイル は 全く 違い まし た。
        english: Before getting married, my lifestyle was completely different. (General)
        hint: 「まえに」 is a more straightforward 'before' without necessarily implying the strong contrast
          or distinct temporal period that 「以前」 conveys. We're looking for a term that emphasizes the
          'before' in relation to a significant life change.
    scene: A person reflecting on their past and present life.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The sentence explicitly states "全く 違いました" (completely different), highlighting the strong
      contrast often implied by 「以前」 when referring to a past state that has since transformed. It sets
      up marriage as a definitive turning point.
  - english: Before starting work, please check your equipment.
    japanese:
      - 仕事 を 始める {以前} に、道具 を 確認 し て ください。
      - 仕事 を 始める {以前} に、道具 を 確認 しろ。
      - 仕事 を 始める {以前} に、道具 を ご 確認 ください。
      - 仕事 始める {以前} に、道具 確認 し て ね。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 仕事 を 始める まえ に、道具 を 確認 し て ください。
        english: Before starting work, please check your equipment. (Neutral)
        hint: 「以前に」 here gives a slightly more formal and precise instruction for a precondition than
          the more common 「まえに」. We're looking for the more formal and precise instruction.
    scene: A supervisor giving instructions to a new employee.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: Using 「以前に」 here gives a slightly more formal and precise instruction than 「始めるまえに」, emphasizing
      that the equipment check is a strict prerequisite or precondition before the work commences.
  - english: I want to return to my former self.
    japanese:
      - '{以前} の 自分 に 戻り たい です。'
      - '{以前} の 自分 に 戻り たい。'
      - '{以前} の 自分 に 戻り たい ん だ。'
      - '{以前} の 己 に 帰り た し。'
    english_literally: Former self to return want.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昔 の 自分 に 戻り たい です。
        english: I want to return to my old self. (More general 'old')
        hint: 「昔」 is a general term for 'old times' or 'long ago' and can refer to a more distant or vague
          past. 「以前」 specifically denotes a 'former' state or version of something, often implying a contrast
          with the present. We're looking for the specific 'former' self.
    scene: Someone expressing a desire to revert to a past state of being.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「以前 の 自分」 clearly refers to a past version of oneself, implying that the current self is different
      and the speaker wishes to revert to that specific prior state. The phrase focuses on the personal
      transformation.
  - english: This is where I lived before.
    japanese:
      - ここ は 私 が {以前} 住ん で い た 場所 です。
      - ここ が {以前} 住ん で た 所 だ よ。
      - ここ {以前} 住ん で た ところ。
      - ここ は {以前} 私 が 住ん で い た 場所 な ん です。
    english_literally: Here, as for me, formerly lived place is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ は 私 が 昔 住ん で い た 場所 です。
        english: This is where I lived long ago. (More distant past)
        hint: While 「昔」 can also refer to a past place, it often implies a more distant past or a sense
          of nostalgia. 「以前」 is more neutral, simply meaning 'formerly' or 'previously', without necessarily
          connoting a distant past. We're looking for the neutral 'formerly'.
    scene: Someone pointing out an old address to a friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    nuance: Even in a friendly context, 「以前」 is perfectly natural for referring to a "former" place. The
      use of 「住んでいた」 (had been living) also reinforces the past continuous state that existed at that
      former location.
  - english: Anything below the manager level cannot attend this meeting.
    japanese:
      - 部 長 {以前} の 職位 の 者 は この 会議 に 出席 でき ませ ん。
      - 部 長 {以前} の 職位 の 方 は、この 会議 に 参加 でき ませ ん。
      - 部 長 {以前} の 者 は、この 会議 に は 出席 でき ませ ん。
    english_literally: Manager before's position's person as for this meeting cannot attend.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 部 長 より 下 の 職位 の 者 は この 会議 に 出席 でき ませ ん。
        english: Anyone below the manager level cannot attend this meeting. (More common for hierarchy)
        hint: While 「より下」 is common for hierarchical 'below', 「以前」 in this context is a more formal and
          slightly abstract way to express 'at or below' a certain rank, similar to 'prior to' in an organizational
          sense. We're looking for the more formal option.
    scene: An executive assistant explaining meeting attendance rules.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Here, 「以前」 is used abstractly to mean "at or below" a certain level in a hierarchy or sequence,
      rather than strictly temporal. This expands its usage beyond simple time, highlighting its ability
      to mark a boundary in a structured context. This phrasing is common in formal rules or regulations.
  - english: All contracts signed before the enactment of this law are invalid.
    japanese:
      - この 法律 が 施行 さ れる {以前} に 締結 さ れ た 全て の 契約 は 無効 です。

          - この 法律 が 施行 さ れる まえ に 締結 さ れ た 全て の 契約 は 無効 です。
        english: All contracts signed before the enactment of this law are invalid. (Less formal for legal
          context)
        hint: In legal or official contexts, 「以前に」 is strongly preferred over 「まえに」 to clearly and formally
          delineate a time boundary, emphasizing the precision required for legal enforceability. We're
          looking for the legally precise term.
    scene: A lawyer explaining legal terms.
    register: formal
    setting: legal
    nuance: This is a very formal and precise usage of 「以前」, typical in legal or official documents, clearly
      demarcating a legal period. The formality matches the legal setting, reinforcing the strictness
      of the condition.
  - english: Before I can even speak, she already understands.
    japanese:
      - 私 が 話す {以前} に、彼女 は もう 理解 し て い ます。
      - 俺 が 話す {以前} に、あいつ もう 分かっ てる。
      - 私 が 口 を 開く {以前} に、彼女 は 全て を 理解 し て いる。
      - 私 が 話す {以前} に、彼女 は 全て を 把握 し て いる。
    english_literally: I speak before, she already understands.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 が 話し 始める まえ に、彼女 は もう 理解 し て い ます。
        english: Before I start speaking, she already understands. (Slightly less nuanced)
        hint: 「以前に」 in this context emphasizes that her understanding precedes even the very attempt or
          possibility of speaking, highlighting extreme speed or intuition. 「話し始める まえに」 is more generic.
          We're looking for the nuance of pre-cognition.
    scene: Someone describing another person's quick understanding.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「以前に」 here emphasizes the immediacy and speed of her understanding, implying that her comprehension
      occurs even before the speaker has a chance to articulate. It highlights an almost pre-emptive grasp
      of the situation.
  - english: Many historical documents from prior to the Edo period have been found.
    japanese:
      - 江戸 時代 {以前} の 数多く の 歴史 的 文書 が 発見 さ れ て い ます。
      - 江戸 時代 {以前} の 多数 の 歴史 的 文献 が 見つかっ て いる。
      - 江戸 時代 {以前} の 膨大 な 歴史 的 資料 が 続々 と 発見 さ れ て いる。
    english_literally: Edo period before's many historical documents have been discovered.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 江戸 時代 より 前 の 数多く の 歴史 的 文書 が 発見 さ れ て い ます。
        english: Many historical documents from before the Edo period have been found. (More colloquial
          for period)
        hint: While 「より前」 is understandable, 「以前」 is the standard and more formal term used in academic
          and historical contexts to delineate historical periods or points in time. We're looking for
          the academic term.
    scene: A historian giving a lecture.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: Common in historical discussions, 「以前」 clearly marks a historical epoch or period, indicating
      that the documents originate from the time before the Edo period commenced. It is the appropriate
      academic phrasing.
  - english: I had lived in that town before.
    japanese:
      - その 町 に は {以前} 住ん で い まし た。
      - あの 町 に は {以前} 住ん で た ん だ。
      - '{以前}、その 町 に 住ん で た。'
      - '{以前}、その 町 に しばらく 住ん で い まし た。'
    english_literally: That town in formerly lived.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 町 に は 前 に 住ん で い まし た。
        english: I had lived in that town before. (More general)
        hint: While 「前 に」 is also correct, 「以前」 used adverbially for 'formerly' or 'previously' is a common
          and slightly more refined choice, implying a past situation that is no longer current. We're
          looking for a slightly more precise term for 'formerly'.
    scene: Someone casually mentioning a past living situation.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「以前」 used as a simple adverb for "formerly" or "before" is quite common and natural, even
      in casual conversation. It subtly suggests a past state that is no longer true, distinguishing it
      from a continuous or current condition.
post_example_writeup: As illustrated by these examples, 「以前」 is a versatile expression for referring to
  a prior time or state. It's often chosen over simpler alternatives when there's an implied contrast
  or change between the past and the present, or in more formal and specific contexts. Whether marking
  a historical period, a stage in one's life, or a precondition for an action, 「以前」 helps precisely delineate
  temporal boundaries and past conditions.
