    "etymology": "「なんか」 is believed to have originated from the adverbial particle 「など」, which means 'such as' or 'and so on'. Over time, it gained a more colloquial and emphatic usage. 「なんて」 is considered a contraction or colloquialization of 「などという」 ('to say something like'), preserving and amplifying the nuance of surprise, disbelief, or slight disdain associated with mentioning something. Both have evolved to incorporate emotional weighting and conversational filler functions.",
    "writeup": "**なんか** and **なんて** are particles in Japanese that serve multiple functions, often expressing a subjective evaluation or adding emphasis. Historically, both are related to the more formal adverbial particle **など**. 「なんか」 is commonly used after nouns, conveying a sense of 'things like' or dismissing the noun as insignificant. For example, when someone says 「お金なんか」 (okane nanka), it can imply 'money? that's not important'.\n\n「なんて」 is more frequently used after verbs, i-adjectives, and na-adjectives (often followed by 「だ」 or 「だった」). It expresses a stronger emotional reaction, such as surprise, disbelief, or disdain towards the preceding statement or concept. For instance, 「嘘なんて」 (uso nante) can mean 'I can't believe it's a lie' or 'I would never tell a lie'.\n\nWhile there is a general tendency for 「なんか」 to follow nouns and 「なんて」 to follow conjugatable words, in modern colloquial Japanese, this distinction is not always strictly observed, and native speakers might use them interchangeably. Both can also function as conversational fillers, similar to 'you know' or 'like' in English, especially 「なんか」. This usage helps to maintain the flow of conversation or soften a statement.\n\nFurthermore, both particles can express a low evaluation. When applied to oneself, it conveys humility (e.g., 「私なんか」 - 'someone like me' in a self-deprecating way). When applied to others, it can be dismissive or even insulting (e.g., 「あいつなんて」 - 'someone like that guy', implying contempt). Understanding the context and speaker's tone is crucial to grasp the exact nuance.",

    "post_example_writeup": "As seen in the examples, the choice between 「なんか」 and 「なんて」 often depends on the type of word preceding it and the emotional nuance the speaker wishes to convey. 「なんか」 tends to be more dismissive or humble, primarily following nouns. 「なんて」 conveys stronger emotional reactions like surprise, disbelief, or disdain, and can follow a wider range of word types. Both can also simply serve as conversational fillers, indicating a momentary pause or a casual transition.",
