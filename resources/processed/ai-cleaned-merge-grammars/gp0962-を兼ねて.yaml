    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を兼ねて」 comes from the verb 「兼ねる(かねる)」, which means \"to hold or combine multiple roles or functions.\" The particle 「を」 marks the noun indicating the secondary purpose or function that is being combined with the primary one.",
    "writeup": "「を兼ねて」 is a grammar pattern derived from the verb 「兼ねる(かねる)」, meaning \"to stretch across to\" or \"to do concurrently.\" The particle 「を」 marks a noun indicating a secondary event or state. 「兼ねて」 is followed by the primary event or state that occurs concurrently with the marked noun. This is often translated as \"to (A) at the same time as (B),\" \"to double as (A),\" or \"to (A) also partly for the purpose of (B).\"  「を兼ねて」 often highlights (B) as the primary goal, while (A) supports it or provides a convenient excuse. To remember that (A) is the secondary goal, consider the literal translation: \"while extending across to (A), (B).\" When multiple goals exist, the case-marking particle 「と」 is used to list the nouns.",
