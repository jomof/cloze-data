    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を兼ねて」 is derived from the verb 「兼ねる (かねる)」, which means \"to combine,\" \"to hold concurrently,\" or \"to double as.\" The particle 「を」 marks the noun that represents one of the purposes or functions.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「を兼ねて」 is derived from the verb 「兼ねる (かねる)」, which fundamentally means \"to combine,\" \"to hold concurrently,\" or \"to double as.\" This pattern indicates that an action serves multiple purposes or functions simultaneously. The particle 「を」 marks the noun that represents one of the secondary purposes or functions being achieved. The structure can often be translated as \"to do X, also for Y,\" \"to double as Y,\" or \"to achieve X while also serving Y.\" It emphasizes that while a primary action is being undertaken, it concurrently fulfills another goal or role. This often implies that the marked noun (Y) is a secondary, yet still important, objective that naturally aligns with or can be conveniently combined with the primary action (X). When listing multiple secondary goals, the case-marking particle 「と」 can be used instead of or in addition to 「を」.",
