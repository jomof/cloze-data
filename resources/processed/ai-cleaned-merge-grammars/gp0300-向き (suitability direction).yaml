    "etymology": "「向き」(muki) derives from 「向く」(muku), a verb meaning 'to face' or 'to turn towards.' Over time, it developed noun forms to indicate 'direction' or 'suitability/inclination.' For instance, something is 'facing' a certain way, or 'turned towards' a specific purpose or audience.",
    "writeup": "「向き」(muki) is a versatile noun in Japanese primarily used to describe orientation and suitability. It functions in two main ways:\n\n1.  **Direction/Facing**: It indicates the direction something is physically facing or oriented towards. For example, when describing a house, you might say it's 南向き (minami muki - south-facing). This specifies its orientation relative to a cardinal direction. This use is common for buildings, rooms, or objects with a defined front.\n\n2.  **Suitability/Intended For**: When appended to a noun, 「向き」 can indicate that something is suitable for, intended for, or designed for a particular group or purpose. For example, 子供向き (kodomo muki - suitable for children) implies that an item or activity is appropriate or designed with children in mind. This usage highlights an intended audience or purpose, implying that the item's characteristics (size, content, complexity) make it a good fit for that group.\n\nUnderstanding these specific uses allows for precise description of both physical orientation and conceptual appropriateness.",
