grammar_point: '[Verb-て]もいい (it''s okay to)'
learn_before:
  - Verb[て] (and then)
  - 〜てはいけない・〜てはならない (must not)
  - てください (polite request)
  - も (addition or emphasis particle)
id: gp0082
meaning: to express that an action is permissible or acceptable
pronunciation:
  katakana: テモイイ
  romaji: te mo ii
formation:
  Verb[て] + もいい: To indicate that an action is allowed or permissible.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  function: Expressing permission or acceptability.
  nuance: Implies that there are no negative consequences or objections to performing the action. It can
    also be used to suggest something.
  counterpoint: The opposite is 〜てはいけない (must not).
  grammatical-role: Forms a predicate indicating permission.
etymology: The construction 〜てもいい combines the て-form of a verb with the particle も (meaning "even") and
  the adjective いい (meaning "good" or "acceptable"). Historically, this literally translates to "even
  if one does [Verb-te], it is good," thus conveying the nuance of "it is permissible" or "it is okay
  to do." The て-form itself, deriving from a conjunctive form, naturally leads into expressing a resulting
  state or condition, which いい then evaluates as positive.
writeup: |-
  The 〜てもいい grammar point is used to express that an action is allowed, permissible, or acceptable. It translates to phrases like "it's okay to," "you may," "can," or "it's fine to."

  It is formed by taking the て-form of a verb and attaching もいい. The て-form connects the action to the evaluation いい. The particle も acts to include the action as being "even acceptable."

  While 〜てもいい primarily indicates permission, it can also be used to offer a suggestion or to state that something is an acceptable option among others. For example, 「食べてもいいです」 could mean "You may eat" (permission) or "It's fine to eat (if you want to)" (suggestion/option).

  - term: 〜てもかまわない
    meaning: it doesn't matter if
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While often interchangeable in granting permission, 〜てもかまわない carries a nuance of "I don't
      care," "I don't mind," or "it's indifferent to me." It grants permission by stating there's no objection,
      which can sometimes sound less warm or less explicitly affirmative than 〜てもいい, which positively
      states it's "good" or "okay."
    grammar_point: 〜てもかまわない (it doesn't matter if)
  - term: 〜てはいけない
    meaning: must not
    kind: antonym
    nuance: This is the direct opposite, expressing prohibition.
    grammar_point: 〜てはいけない・〜てはならない (must not)
  - term: 〜てはならない
    meaning: must not, prohibition
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Similar to 〜てはいけない, but often sounds more formal or absolute, used for rules or strong prohibitions.
    grammar_point: 〜てはいけない・〜てはならない (must not)
  - term: 〜てもいいですか
    meaning: may I?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a question asking for permission, whereas 〜てもいい grants permission.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜てもいいですか (may I?)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 〜てもいい and 〜てもかまわない, consider the nuance. 〜てもいい is a
  straightforward statement of permission, implying that the action is positive or acceptable. 〜てもかまわない,
  on the other hand, conveys that there is no objection or negative consequence, often used when one is
  indifferent or simply allows something without enthusiastic approval. For prohibitions, 〜てはいけない is the
  common direct opposite, while 〜てはならない conveys a stronger, more formal sense of prohibition. Finally,
  remember that 〜てもいいですか is used to ask for permission, while 〜てもいい is used to give it.
