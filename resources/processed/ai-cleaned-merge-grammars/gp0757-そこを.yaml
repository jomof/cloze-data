    "etymology": "「そこ」 refers to the place or situation that presents a problem. 「を」 indicates that one is trying to move past or overcome that situation. Thus, 「そこを」 implies 'overcoming that place/situation'.",
    "writeup": "「そこを」 is used as a conjunction to express a desire for someone to do something despite a difficult or problematic situation. It carries a nuance of imploring or requesting special consideration. Think of it as pleading for someone to 'somehow' or 'in some way' overcome the stated difficulty. It's often used when asking for a favor or making a request that might be difficult to fulfill. It is similar to saying \"I know it's difficult, but...\"",
