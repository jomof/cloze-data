    "etymology": "ましょう is derived from the auxiliary verb ます (masu), indicating politeness. It is the volitional form of ます, expressing intent or invitation in a polite way. Historically, it evolved from earlier forms that also conveyed intent or recommendation.",
    "writeup": "ましょう is a versatile auxiliary verb used to express polite suggestions, invitations, or the speaker's own volition or intention. It attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. For instance, 食べます (tabemasu, to eat) becomes 食べましょう (tabemashou, let's eat or I will eat). It is commonly translated as \"let's\" when making a suggestion to others, as in \"Let's go together.\" However, it can also convey the speaker's firm resolution or intention, similar to \"I shall\" or \"We will\" in English. In this latter usage, the speaker is expressing a deliberate and purposeful action, often to themselves or as a declaration to others, without necessarily inviting participation. The politeness of ましょう makes it suitable for a wide range of social contexts, from casual suggestions among friends to more formal declarations in a business setting.",
