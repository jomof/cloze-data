    "etymology": "ましょう is derived from the auxiliary verb ます (masu), indicating politeness. It's the volitional form, expressing intent or invitation in a polite way.",
    "writeup": "ましょう is a polite way to express a suggestion, invitation, or intention. It's commonly translated as \"let's\" or \"shall we?\" in English. It is attached to the ます-stem of a verb. For example, 食べます (tabemasu, to eat) becomes 食べましょう (tabemashou, let's eat). It conveys a sense of politeness and is suitable for various social situations. ましょう can also be used to express one's own intention in a polite way.",
