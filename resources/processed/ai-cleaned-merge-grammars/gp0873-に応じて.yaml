    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に応じて」 is derived from the verb 「応じる」 (おうじる), meaning \"to respond,\" \"to comply with,\" or \"to accept.\" The 「に」 indicates direction or target, and the 「て」 form connects the verb to the following clause, indicating a cause-and-effect or dependency relationship. The full grammar point means that something is done or varies in accordance with a preceding noun.",
    "writeup": "「に応じて」 is used to express that something changes, is done, or is chosen based on a certain condition or requirement. It indicates a relationship of dependency or suitability. It's often translated as \"depending on,\" \"in response to,\" or \"according to.\" 「に応じて」 follows a noun. The phrase 「に応じた」 directly modifies a noun, indicating something is suitable for, or adapted to, the preceding noun.",
