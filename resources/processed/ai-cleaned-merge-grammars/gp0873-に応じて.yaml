    "etymology": "に応じて is derived from the verb 応じる (ōjiru), meaning \"to respond, to accept, to comply with.\" The に indicates direction or purpose, and the て-form connects it to the main clause, indicating a cause-and-effect or conditional relationship.",
    "writeup": "に応じて (ni ōjite) expresses that something is done in a way that is applicable to what is necessary or appropriate based on a given condition. It's often translated as \"depending on,\" \"according to,\" or \"in response to.\"  The nuance is that (B) is determined or modified by (A).\n\nに応じて appears after nouns, or as 応じた (conjugated form) when directly modifying another noun. 応じる usually indicates the way something 'responds to' or 'answers' an issue on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, the action or state described in (B) frequently changes depending on the intensity or severity of (A).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The focus is on adapting or adjusting something to fit a specific need or situation.\n*   It can also imply a sense of proportionality, where the degree of (B) is proportional to the degree of (A).",
