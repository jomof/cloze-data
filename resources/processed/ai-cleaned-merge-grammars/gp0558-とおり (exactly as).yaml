jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express exact correspondence or accordance with a preceding statement, action,
    or plan.
  function: Indicates that something happens or is done precisely as, or in conformity with, something
    else.
  nuance: Emphasizes a high degree of congruence, exactness, or faithful replication. It implies that
    the outcome perfectly matches the original state, instruction, or expectation.
  grammatical-role: adverbial
etymology: The word 「とおり」 originates from the verb 「通る(とおる)」 (to pass through, to go along). As a noun,
  「通り(とおり)」 means "street" or "way." The grammatical usage extends this sense to mean "in the way/manner
  of" something, implying that something follows a particular path or manner exactly.
writeup: 'The Japanese word 「とおり」 (or 「どおり」) functions as a suffix indicating that something occurs **exactly**
  as, **precisely** as, or **just like** something else. While its kanji form, 「通り」, literally means ''street''
  or ''way'', its grammatical usage extends this concept to denote a high degree of congruence or sameness.
  This grammar point can follow both verbs and nouns. When attached to **verbs**, it typically appears
  after either the **dictionary (plain non-past) form** or the **plain past form**. For instance, 「言うとおり」
  (as one says) or 「言ったとおり」 (as one said). When following **nouns**, two patterns are possible: 「[Noun]
  の とおり」 or 「[Noun] どおり」. Both are grammatically correct and convey the same meaning of "according to
  the noun" or "just like the noun". However, 「[Noun] どおり」 is generally more common, especially in spoken
  Japanese. Note that 「とおり」 without 「の」 directly after a noun is incorrect; it must be 「[Noun] の とおり」
  or 「[Noun] どおり」. This construction is frequently used in everyday conversation to express agreement.
  Phrases like 「言った通り」 or 「その通り」 are very common and serve as polite ways to affirm what another person
  has stated, translating to expressions such as "That''s exactly right!" or "Precisely!"'

  - term: ように・ような
    meaning: as, like, just like
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「とおり」, 「ように」 often expresses a desire or goal, or a comparison, not necessarily an
      exact match.
    grammar_point: ように (like)
  - term: れる・られる+ままに
    meaning: do as (one is told or ordered…), in accordance with, in compliance with, just like
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ままに」 implies following instructions or orders, often with a sense of being powerless to resist,
      while 「とおり」 can refer to a general expectation or plan being met.
    grammar_point: Verb[れる・られる]~ままに (as one is told)
  - term: ままに (as desired)
    meaning: as (one likes, feels or pleases), spur of the moment, wherever one fancies, spontaneously,
      on a whim
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ままに」 emphasizes acting freely or spontaneously according to one's desires, which contrasts
      with the structured or expected nature implied by 「とおり」.
    grammar_point: ままに (as desired)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ように」, 「ままに」, and 「とおり」 can all convey similarity or accordance, their
  nuances differ. 「ように」 is often used for goals or comparisons, implying resemblance. 「ままに」 suggests acting
  on impulse or according to instruction, sometimes with a sense of being carried along. In contrast,
  「とおり」 highlights that something happened or should happen exactly as planned, expected, or described,
  emphasizing precise conformity.

    scene: A supervisor instructing a new employee.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: The use of 「～てください」 makes this an instruction, and 「説明書」 specifies a document to be followed
      precisely. 「この」 points to a specific manual.
    etymology: The phrase 「通り に」 literally means 'in the way/manner of', reflecting the etymological root
      of とおり as 'street' or 'path'.

          to the spoken words.
    scene: A conductor giving instructions to an orchestra.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: 「これから 言う」 indicates an action that is about to happen, and 「通りに」 specifies that the listener
      should follow the instructions precisely as they are given.

    scene: A student reflecting on a challenging exam she just took.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「思った」 (past form of 思う) indicates that her prior expectation was confirmed by the
      reality of the exam. The subject 「彼女」 is explicitly stated. The addition of 「ぜ」 in the second Japanese
      option makes it sound more masculine and assertive, often used by younger males, but the context
      of the female speaker implies it would not be used by her.
    etymology: 「思った通り」 is a common collocation, literally meaning 'in the way one thought', highlighting
      the precise alignment between an internal thought or prediction and an external reality.

        english: In accordance with the plan, all preparations are complete.

      especially compound nouns or those forming common phrases, maintaining the sense of exact adherence

      is exactly on the right 'track' or matches the truth precisely. This is a fixed idiom.

      matches the statement, stemming from the 'path/way' meaning of とおり.

        english: As you may have guessed, we've decided to start a new project.
        hint: 「お察し の ように」 is similar but 「お察し の 通り」 has a slightly stronger implication of 'your guess

          their inference was accurate.
    scene: A manager discreetly informing a team member about a new initiative.
    register: semi-formal

      to the listener. The last example with 「開始 する 運び と なり まし た」 uses formal business Japanese, indicating
      a more official announcement.
    etymology: 「お察しの通り」 combines the honorific form of 'to guess/surmise' with とおり, conveying 'exactly
      as you have correctly inferred' or 'it is precisely as you suspected.'

          to the recipe.

    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    nuance: This example uses 「レシピ」 (recipe) and 「書いてある」 (what is written), highlighting that the instructions
      must be followed with high precision. The casual 「～て ください」 makes it a friendly instruction.

      precisely, ensuring the outcome is exactly as intended by the recipe writer.

          fulfillment of a negative prediction.
    scene: A disheartened team member talking to a colleague after a project's failure.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「恐れていた通り」 (just as I feared) explicitly connects a past apprehension to a present
      unfortunate reality, confirming the speaker's premonition. The casual speech ending 「～しちまった」 reinforces
      the personal disappointment, typical of male casual speech.
    etymology: This emphasizes the literal 'path' of fear leading to its exact manifestation, implying
      an unfortunate but precise fulfillment of a prediction.

          tradition.

          looking for precise conformity to the custom.
    scene: A business representative explaining event plans to local community leaders.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「習慣どおり」 is a common phrase to indicate respect for established norms and practices, ensuring
      smooth proceedings. The formal verb ending 「進め ます」 or humble 「進め させ て いただき ます」 suits the professional
      setting.
    etymology: Using 「どおり」 with 「習慣」 (custom) highlights the act of precisely following established traditions,
      literally 'walking the path' of custom.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「とおり」 and 「どおり」 are used to convey exact correspondence
  in various contexts, from following instructions to confirming expectations or adhering to customs.
  The choice between 「～の とおり」 and 「～どおり」 often depends on the type of noun and register, with 「～どおり」 being
  more common for common nouns and in more concise expressions.
