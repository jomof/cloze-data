        "usage-context": "This construction is commonly used to introduce a broad topic (A) with は, and then specify a particular attribute or part (B) of that topic using が, followed by a description (C). This attribute or part is often something inherent, a state, an ability, or a desire that cannot be directly controlled by the topic. It's particularly useful for expressing natural states, physical characteristics, likes/dislikes, or aptitudes.",
        "function": "To narrow the focus from a general topic to a specific aspect or attribute within that topic, emphasizing that aspect.",
        "nuance": "The combination of は and が creates a nuanced relationship where は establishes the main topic, setting the stage, while が highlights a specific element or aspect of that topic that possesses a certain characteristic. It's often used when the characteristic being described is not something the topic does, but something it is or has (e.g., 'Elephants have long noses,' not 'Elephants make their noses long'). It implies an inherent quality or state. It can also be used to draw a contrast with other similar topics.",
        "grammatical-role": "The は marks the main topic, which acts as a larger framework. The が then marks the subject of the predicate that describes the specific attribute within that framework.",
        "logical-flow": "Introduces a general domain (topic A), then singles out a particular item (B) within that domain, and finally states something about that particular item (C). It's a 'topic-attribute-description' flow."
    },
    "etymology": "The particles 「は」 (wa) and 「が」 (ga) have distinct historical roles. 「は」 evolved from the emphatic particle 「は」 used in Old Japanese, becoming the primary topic marker. It sets the theme or common ground for the sentence. 「が」, on the other hand, originated as a possessive particle (similar to 'of') and developed into the subject marker. In the 「は〜が」 construction, the historical functions combine: 「は」 establishes the overarching topic, and 「が」 then singles out the specific element within that topic that the following predicate describes. This creates a logical flow from general (topic) to specific (attribute/subject).",
    "writeup": "The 「は〜が」 construction is a fundamental structure in Japanese that allows speakers to describe a specific attribute or characteristic of a broader topic. The part before 「は」 (A) introduces the overall topic or theme of the sentence, setting the context. The part before 「が」 (B) then specifies a particular element, attribute, or part *of* that previously introduced topic. Finally, the predicate (C) describes the characteristic of that specified element (B).\n\nThis construction is crucial for expressing intrinsic qualities, abilities, desires, or states that are often beyond the direct control of the topic. For instance, when you say 「象は鼻が長い」 (Elephants have long noses), you are not saying elephants *do* long noses, but rather that long noses are an inherent characteristic *of* elephants. The 「は」 sets 'elephants' as the general topic, and then 「鼻が」 specifically points to 'noses' *as the part that is long*.\n\nIt is often used in situations where:\n*   **Describing physical attributes or inherent characteristics:** 「彼は背が高い」 (He is tall – lit. 'As for him, back is tall').\n*   **Expressing abilities or aptitudes:** 「田中さんは料理が上手だ」 (Tanaka-san is good at cooking – lit. 'As for Tanaka-san, cooking is skillful').\n*   **Stating desires or feelings:** 「私は喉が渇いた」 (I am thirsty – lit. 'As for me, throat is parched').\n*   **Highlighting a specific aspect of a general category:** 「日本は冬が寒い」 (In Japan, winter is cold – lit. 'As for Japan, winter is cold').\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The particle 「が」 in this construction is not marking the primary subject of the entire sentence in the traditional sense, but rather the subject *of the description (C)* that applies to the attribute (B) of the initial topic (A). The main topic (A) is marked by 「は」.\n*   This structure allows for a clear distinction between the broad topic and the specific attribute being discussed, often implying that while the topic might have many aspects, this particular one is being highlighted.",
