    "etymology": "The expression 「といってもいい」 comes from 「と言う」 (to say) + 「ても」 (even if) + 「いい」 (good). Thus, literally, it means \"even if you say (A), it is good/ok.\"",
    "writeup": "「といってもいい」 is a common expression in Japanese that literally means \"even if you say (A), it is good/ok\". This is translated more naturally as \"you could say (A)\" or \"you might say (A)\".\n\nAs the 「と」 at the beginning of the phrase is the 'quotation' use of the 「と」 particle, 「といってもいい」 may be used after almost any statement that the speaker wants to quote.\n\n**Important Note:** Most grammatical structures in Japanese that use 「言う」 will often appear without kanji. This is simply to make them easier to recognize as a grammar pattern, rather than a standard word in a sentence. This is also true for patterns that include 「行く」 or 「来る」.",
