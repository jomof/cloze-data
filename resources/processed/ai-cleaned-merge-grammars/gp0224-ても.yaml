    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ても」 is a combination of the 「て」-form of a verb or adjective and the particle 「も」. The 「て」-form serves as a conjunctive particle, linking clauses and sometimes indicating a temporal sequence, cause, or means. The particle 「も」, in this context, adds the nuance of 'even,' 'also,' or 'likewise,' creating a concessive conditional meaning. Historically, this construction evolved from simply linking clauses with 「て」 and then adding 「も」 to emphasize the unexpected nature of the outcome despite the preceding condition.",
    "writeup": "The 「ても」 grammar pattern is used to express 'even if,' 'even though,' or 'no matter how/what.' It indicates that despite the condition or situation described in the first clause, the event or state in the second clause still occurs or remains true, often contrary to expectation. This makes it a crucial pattern for conveying resilience, acceptance, or unexpected results.\n\nTo form 「ても」:\n*   For **verbs**, conjugate them into their **て-form** and add 「も」. For example, 食べる (to eat) becomes 食べても (even if one eats).\n*   For **い-adjectives**, remove the final 「い」 and add 「くても」. For example, 寒い (cold) becomes 寒くても (even if it's cold).\n*   For **な-adjectives**, add 「でも」. For example, 静か (quiet) becomes 静かでも (even if it's quiet).\n*   For **nouns**, add 「でも」. For example, 学生 (student) becomes 学生でも (even if one is a student).\n\nThis pattern is highly versatile and frequently encountered in daily Japanese. It can also be used to highlight negative sentences, translating similarly to 'even if not (A)' or 'even though not (A)'. For instance, 行かなくても (even if I don't go) or 好きじゃなくても (even if I don't like it).",
