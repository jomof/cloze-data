    "writeup": "The い-adjective 「**欲しい (hoshii)**」 expresses the speaker's desire for something. It functions similarly to other stative adjectives. The person who wants something is marked by 「は」 or 「が」, and the desired object is marked by 「が」.\n\nFor expressing someone *else's* desire, use the verb 「欲しがる (hoshigaru)」, which means \"to want\" or \"to desire\".",
