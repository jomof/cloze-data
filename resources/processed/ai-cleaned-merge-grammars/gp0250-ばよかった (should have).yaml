details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: general use
  function: Expresses regret or a wish that a past action had been different.
  nuance: Implies the speaker now recognizes a different past action would have led to a better outcome.
    Often carries a sense of missed opportunity or self-reproach.
  counterpoint: In contrast to 「ばいい」, which expresses a wish or suggestion for the present or future.
etymology: The grammar point 「ばよかった」 is derived from the conditional form 「～ば」 (if) combined with 「よかった」
  (was good). Literally, it translates to "it would have been good if…". The 「ば」 highlights a hypothetical
  situation, and 「よかった」 expresses the speaker's sentiment that the situation would have been preferable
  to the actual outcome.
writeup: |-
  「ばよかった」 is used to express regret or a wish that something had been done differently. It combines the conditional particle 「ば」 with the past tense of the い-adjective 「良い」 (いい), which conjugates to 「よかった」. This construction translates to "I wish I had done (A)" or "I should have done (A)." It is used after verbs conjugated into the conditional 「ば」 form.

  The conjugation to the conditional 「ば」 form varies by verb group:

  *   For Group 1 verbs (五段動詞, Godan Doushi), the final う sound changes to え, and ば is added (e.g., 話す → 話せば).
  *   For Group 2 verbs (一段動詞, Ichidan Doushi), the final る is dropped, and れば is added (e.g., 食べる → 食べれば).
  *   Irregular verbs する (suru) and 来る (kuru) become すれば and 来れば respectively.

  It's **important** to note the contrast with 「ばいい」, the non-past version, which means "it would be good if (A)".

  - term: たらいい・といい
    meaning: It would be nice if, It would be good if, Should, I hope
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ばよかった」 which expresses regret about the past, 「たらいい」 and 「といい」 express a desire or
      hope for a present or future situation.
    grammar_point: たらいい・といい (hope・suggestion)
  - term: てよかった
    meaning: I'm glad that
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ばよかった」 which expresses regret, 「てよかった」 expresses relief or satisfaction about something
      that happened.
    grammar_point: てよかった (glad or relieved that)
  - term: べきだった
    meaning: Should have (duty/obligation)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express 'should have', 「べきだった」 implies a strong sense of duty or obligation that
      was not fulfilled. 「ばよかった」 is a more general expression of regret or a wish for a different past
      action.
    grammar_point: べき (should)
  - term: ～ない方がよかった
    meaning: It would have been better not to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This phrase expresses that not doing something would have been preferable. It's often a factual
      preference for non-action, whereas 「ばよかった」 implies personal regret about an action taken or not
      taken.
    grammar_point: ないほうがいい (better not to)
  - term: ～たかった
    meaning: Wanted to do, but didn't
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～たかった」 expresses a past desire or wish that was not fulfilled. 「ばよかった」 goes further to express
      regret about the consequence of that unfulfilled desire or a past action/inaction.
    grammar_point: たい (want to do)
  - term: たらよかった
    meaning: It would have been better if (colloquial regret)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: たらよかった is a colloquial and sometimes softer alternative to ばよかった, carrying a similar meaning
      of regret for a past action or state. It's often used conversationally.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:たらよかった (it would have been better if)
  - term: 後悔する
    meaning: to regret
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 後悔する directly states the act of regretting, ばよかった expresses the regret by implying a
      hypothetical better alternative action in the past.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:後悔する (to regret)
  - term: ていたら
    meaning: if (hypothetical past)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ていたら presents a general hypothetical condition in the past and its consequence, while ばよかった
      specifically conveys the speaker's regret about their own past action or inaction.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ていたら (if hypothetical)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ばよかった」 conveys regret about a past action or inaction, expressions
  like 「たらいい」 and 「といい」 are used for expressing hopes or suggestions for the present or future. In contrast,
  「てよかった」 signifies relief or contentment regarding a past event. 「べきだった」 implies a strong, unfulfilled
  duty, unlike the more general regret of 「ばよかった」. Furthermore, 「～ない方がよかった」 is a direct preference for
  not having done something, and 「～たかった」 expresses a past desire that was not met, all differing from
  the nuanced regret of 「ばよかった」. Additionally, 「たらよかった」 is a colloquial variation of regret, while 「後悔する」
  is a direct verb for 'to regret'. 「ていたら」 is a general conditional for hypothetical pasts, lacking the
  specific nuance of regret present in 「ばよかった」.

          consequences, but 「ばよかった」 specifically focuses on the speaker's regret about their own action
          or inaction. We're looking for a direct expression of 'should have' as a form of regret.

post_example_writeup: Understanding the precise nuance of regret is crucial in Japanese. 「ばよかった」 directly
  communicates a wish that a past action had been different, often implying a sense of self-reproach or
  a recognition of a missed opportunity. While other expressions can convey similar sentiments, 「ばよかった」
  specifically uses the conditional form to posit a hypothetical, better past, distinguishing it from
  general past desires or duties.
