jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  function: expresses ongoing thought, current opinion, or settled belief
  nuance: Implies a continuous state of thinking or a firmly held belief, distinct from a momentary thought
    (と思う).
  grammatical-role: acts as a predicate to express the speaker's internal state
etymology: The construction combines と (to), which functions as a quotative particle marking the preceding
  clause as a direct or indirect quote or the content of thought, with 思う (omou), meaning "to think" or
  "to feel." The ている (te-iru) ending signifies a continuous state or an ongoing action. Historically,
  思う has been used to express internal thoughts and feelings. The addition of ている specifically emphasizes
  the state of holding that thought or belief, distinguishing it from a one-time mental act. This evolution
  allows for a more nuanced expression of a held opinion or a prolonged state of consideration.
writeup: |-
  〜と思っている (to omotte iru) is a grammatical construction used to express what one is currently thinking or what one's settled belief or opinion is. It combines the quotative particle と (to) with the verb 思う (omou - to think) in its て形 (te-form), 思って (omotte), followed by the auxiliary verb いる (iru - to exist, indicating a continuous state).

  Unlike the simple 〜と思う (to omou), which can express a momentary thought or a general opinion, 〜と思っている emphasizes a continuous state of thinking or a belief that is held over a period. It suggests that the speaker has considered something and holds a particular view or is currently engaged in the act of thinking.

  This form is versatile and can be used with various types of clauses preceding と:

  *   **Verb clauses**: 「明日、雨が降ると{思っています}。」 (I think it will rain tomorrow.)
  *   **い-Adjective clauses**: 「この本は面白いと{思っています}。」 (I think this book is interesting.)
  *   **な-Adjective clauses**: 「彼は親切だと{思っています}。」 (I think he is kind.) - Note: な-Adjectives use だ before と.
  *   **Noun clauses**: 「彼女は学生だと{思っています}。」 (I think she is a student.) - Note: Nouns use だ before と.

  It is important to understand the nuance:

  *   **と思う**: Can be a spontaneous thought or a general, less personal opinion.
      *   「あ、雨が降ると{思う}。」 (Oh, I think it will rain. - Sudden thought)
  *   **と思っている**: Implies a more sustained thought process, a current belief, or an opinion that has been formed.
      *   「地球温暖化は深刻な問題だと{思っています}。」 (I believe global warming is a serious problem. - Settled belief)
false_friends:
  - term: 〜と思う
    meaning: I think / I believe (momentary or general thought)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜と思う expresses a more immediate or general thought/opinion. It lacks the continuous or settled
      belief nuance of 〜と思っている. For example, 「美味しいと{思う}」 (I think it's delicious) is a direct reaction,
      while 「美味しいと{思っている}」 (I believe it's delicious) implies a settled opinion formed over time or experience.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:と 思う (I think or thought)
  - term: 〜と言っている
    meaning: someone is saying / has said
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While structurally similar (と + verb in ている form), 〜と言っている uses 言う (iu - to say) instead of
      思う (omou - to think). It reports what someone else is saying or has said, not one's own internal
      thought or belief.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て]いる (ongoing state・habitual action・resultant state)
  - term: 〜と考えている
    meaning: I am considering / I am thinking (carefully)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜と考えている uses 考える (kangaeru - to consider, to ponder), which implies a more deliberate, deeper,
      or analytical thought process compared to the general 思う. It suggests active contemplation or planning.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て]考える (to be considering・to be thinking carefully)
post_false_friends_writeup: When deciding between 〜と思う, 〜と思っている, and 〜と考えている, consider the **duration**
  and **depth** of the thought. 〜と思う is for quick, immediate opinions. 〜と思っている is for opinions or beliefs
  held over time, or thoughts that are currently ongoing. 〜と考えている is for more deliberate, analytical,
  or long-term considerations. For example, if you just tasted something and it's good, you'd say 「美味しいと{思う}」.
  If you've loved that food your whole life, you'd say 「美味しいと{思っている}」. If you're pondering a complex problem,
  you'd say 「どうすればいいかと{考えている}」.
