        "[Sentence 1]. ついては, [Sentence 2]": "Indicates that Sentence 2 is a consequence, further explanation, or related action to Sentence 1.",

        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Primarily used in formal writing, official documents, business settings, and formal announcements. It connects two statements where the second provides a consequence, elaboration, or related action to the first.",
        "function": "Connects two sentences where the second sentence is a consequence, elaboration, or related action to the first.",
        "nuance": "Implies a strong logical connection between the preceding statement and the following one, signaling that what follows is a direct action, decision, or explanation based on the previous information. It is often used to present a course of action or a new policy stemming from a previous situation."
    },
    "etymology": "\"ついては\" is derived from the verb 「付く(つく)」 (tsuku), meaning \"to attach\" or \"to be related to,\" combined with the topic marker 「は」 (wa). Over time, it evolved to function as a conjunction indicating a logical connection, consequence, or further explanation between two statements, often initiating a new course of action or detail based on what was previously stated.",
    "writeup": "\"ついては\" is a highly formal conjunction used to establish a clear logical connection between two statements. It translates roughly to \"therefore,\" \"consequently,\" or \"with regard to this.\" This expression is predominantly found in formal writing, official announcements, business communications, and speeches where a professional and precise tone is required. It signals that the following sentence is a direct consequence, an elaboration, or a necessary action stemming from the situation or information presented in the preceding sentence. Unlike more casual connecting words, \"ついては\" adds a sense of gravity and officiality, making it ideal for conveying decisions, policies, or explanations in a structured manner. Its use implies that the subsequent action or statement is a logical and often necessary step given the prior context. It is less common in everyday conversation and is generally avoided in casual speech.",
