details:
  part-of-speech: pronoun
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Refers to something physically or conceptually close to the speaker. Can be used for
    introducing items, identifying things, or referring to ongoing topics.
  function: To point out or refer to something that the speaker perceives as being in their immediate
    vicinity, whether physical or conceptual.
  nuance: Implies a sense of this one right here/this particular thing as perceived by the speaker. It
    brings the item into the speaker's immediate domain of reference.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a noun, so it can be a subject, object, or part of a predicate with a
    copula.
etymology: The Japanese demonstrative system (こそあど言葉 - ko-so-a-do kotoba) has roots in Old Japanese. The
  ko- series (これ, この, ここ, こちら) indicates proximity to the speaker. This system is ancient and fundamental
  to the language's spatial and contextual referencing. これ specifically refers to a thing (mono), in contrast
  to ここ (place) or こんな (manner). Its core function has remained consistent throughout history, reflecting
  the fundamental human need to refer to objects in relation to one's own position.
writeup: |-
  これ (kore) is a fundamental Japanese demonstrative pronoun, meaning "this" or "this one." It belongs to the "ko" series of demonstratives, which are used to refer to things, places, or directions that are perceived as being close to the speaker.

  Unlike この (kono), which is a demonstrative determiner that must be followed by a noun (e.g., この本 - "this book"), これ acts as a standalone pronoun. It can directly replace a noun when the item being referred to is clearly understood from context or is being pointed at.

  これ is versatile and can refer to:
  *   **Physical objects**: When you are holding or are very close to an object.
  *   **Abstract concepts or ideas**: Something that has just been mentioned, is currently being discussed, or is about to be explained by the speaker.
  *   **A situation**: The current state of affairs or a particular scenario.

  When used with the copula です (polite) or だ (casual), これ forms basic identification sentences, such as 「これ は ペン です。」 (This is a pen.). It can also function as the subject or object of a verb or particle, similar to any other noun. Understanding これ is crucial for navigating basic conversations and distinguishing between what is near you, near the listener, or far from both.

  - term: それ
    meaning: that (thing/one)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: それ refers to something near the listener or something recently mentioned by the listener.
      Unlike これ, it implies proximity to the listener, not the speaker.
    grammar_point: それ (that)
  - term: あれ
    meaning: that (thing/one) over there
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: あれ refers to something far from both the speaker and the listener. It indicates a greater
      distance than これ or それ.
    grammar_point: あれ (that over there)
  - term: この
    meaning: this (determiner)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: この is a demonstrative determiner that must always precede a noun (e.g., この本 - "this book").
      これ is a standalone pronoun and cannot directly precede a noun. We're looking for a standalone "this"
      here.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:この (this・near speaker)
  - term: ここ
    meaning: here (place)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ここ refers to "this place" or "here," indicating a location. これ refers to "this thing" or "this
      one," indicating an object or concept.
    grammar_point: ここ (here)
post_false_friends_writeup: The "ko-so-a-do" system can be confusing initially, but the distinction between
  これ, それ, and あれ is primarily about relative distance from the speaker and listener. これ is always speaker-centric.
  この is distinct from これ because この modifies a noun, while これ stands alone. ここ specifies a location, whereas
  これ refers to an object or idea. Keeping these contextual differences in mind will help avoid common
  mix-ups.
