        "usage-context": "Used in formal writing and speech to indicate that something is true for a given element, and even more so for another element, or that a foundational truth extends to another aspect.",
        "function": "Emphasizes an additional fact or inherent truth.",
        "nuance": "The particle は highlights the initial element, もとより emphasizes the 'origin' or 'base' from which other truths extend. It can imply that the first fact is obvious or basic, while the second is a further implication. It has two main nuances: 'not only A, but also B' and 'from the start/by nature A is B'.",
        "grammatical-role": "Connects two related statements or elements, showing an additive or foundational relationship."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「はもとより」 is composed of three elements: the topic particle 「は」 (ha), the noun 「元」 (moto), meaning 'origin' or 'base', and the particle 「より」 (yori), meaning 'from' or 'than'. Literally, it conveys a sense of 'from the origin' or 'more than the base'. This etymology underpins its two main uses: the additive sense ('not only from the base/origin but also beyond') and the inherent sense ('inherently, from the very beginning'). The combination evolved to express that a primary or obvious fact serves as a starting point for further implications or additional truths.",
    "writeup": "「はもとより」, often written in hiragana as はもとより, is a versatile grammatical expression that functions in two primary ways:\n\n1.  **\"Not only A, but also B\" (～だけでなく～も)**: This is the most common usage. It indicates that something applies to (A), and even more so, or additionally, to (B). The element (A) is often something obvious, basic, or expected, while (B) represents an extension or a more significant point. It serves to highlight the broader scope or additional applicability of a statement.\n    *   It can attach to nouns directly.\n    *   It can attach to verb phrases that have been nominalized using 「の」 or 「こと」.\n\n2.  **\"From the start / By nature A is B\" (最初から / 生来)**: In this less common but equally valid usage, 「はもとより」 emphasizes that a certain condition or truth is inherent, foundational, or has existed from the very beginning. It highlights the innate quality or initial state of something. The context usually makes it clear which meaning is intended. This meaning emphasizes a fundamental truth rather than an additive one.\n\n「はもとより」 carries a formal register and is more commonly found in written Japanese or formal spoken contexts. It is a more formal alternative to expressions like 「はもちろん」 or 「だけでなく」, lending a sense of weight and comprehensiveness to the statement.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「はもちろん」 is generally less formal than 「はもとより」 and can be used in a wider range of contexts. It often emphasizes that the first item is an obvious fact. While 「はもとより」 can convey a similar meaning, it has a more formal and somewhat literary feel, implying a foundational or inherent truth from which other facts extend."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「だけでなく(て)〜も」 is a more common and versatile expression for 'not only... but also' and is less formal than 「はもとより」. It directly links two items in an additive way. 「はもとより」 can imply a more inherent or foundational relationship between the two items, often suggesting that the second item is a natural extension or consequence of the first."

            "nuance": "「のみならず」 is a very formal and literary equivalent of 'not only... but also'. It is often used in written Japanese and has a strong sense of adding significant information. While similar in formality to 「はもとより」, 「のみならず」 tends to emphasize the addition of further, often equally important, information, whereas 「はもとより」 can also imply a foundational or inherent truth."

            "nuance": "「に限らず」 means 'not limited to' or 'not just' and emphasizes that something is true for a specific case and extends beyond it to other, similar cases. It focuses on the scope or inclusiveness. In contrast, 「はもとより」 explicitly states that something is true for one item and additionally for another, which may not necessarily be part of the same category, or it emphasizes an inherent truth."

            "nuance": "「ばかりでなく」 is a common expression for 'not only... but also' and is generally less formal than 「はもとより」. It highlights that something is true for one item, and then, in addition, for another. It can sometimes carry a nuance of surprise or emphasis on the second item. 「はもとより」, on the other hand, can also imply an inherent or foundational relationship, or that the first item is an obvious base from which the second truth extends."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While several expressions convey the idea of 'not only... but also' in Japanese, understanding their subtle differences in nuance and formality is crucial for precise communication. 「はもとより」 stands out for its formal tone and its ability to imply either an additive relationship, where one fact is a clear extension of another, or to highlight an inherent, foundational truth. Expressions like 「はもちろん」 and 「だけでなく」 are more casual and broadly used, while 「のみならず」 maintains a high degree of formality, often used in written language. 「に限らず」 emphasizes broader applicability, and 「ばかりでなく」 tends to highlight additional surprising facts. Choosing the appropriate expression depends on the desired level of formality, the specific relationship between the two elements, and whether an inherent truth is being conveyed.",
