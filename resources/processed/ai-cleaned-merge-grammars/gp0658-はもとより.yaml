    "etymology": "The grammar point 「はもとより」 is derived from 「元(もと)」 meaning 'origin' or 'source,' and 「より」 which indicates comparison. The phrase literally suggests that something is true not just from its origin or basic nature, but extends beyond that.",
    "writeup": "「はもとより」, commonly seen purely in hiragana, indicates \"not only (A), but also (B)\", or \"let alone (A), (B).\" The construction combines 「は」, 「元(もと)」 'origin', and 「より」, highlighting that \"even compared to the original fact of (A), (B)\". Often, (A) is obvious or well-known. 「はもとより」 follows nouns or verb phrases nominalized with 「の」 or 「こと」. Alternatively, 「はもとより」 shows (A) as the base from which (B) is also a fact, translating to \"from the start, (A) is (B)\" or \"by nature, (A) is (B)\". Context clarifies which meaning is used.",
