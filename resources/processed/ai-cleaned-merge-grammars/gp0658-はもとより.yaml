    "etymology": "The grammar point 「はもとより」 is constructed from 「は」 (the topic marker), 「元」 (moto, meaning 'origin' or 'base'), and 「より」 (yori, meaning 'than'). Thus, it literally means 'more than the origin,' implying that something is true not only from the start or by its very nature, but also extends to other aspects.",
    "writeup": "「はもとより」, often written in hiragana, indicates \"not only (A), but also (B)\" or \"let alone (A), (B).\" It combines 「は」, the noun 「元」 ('origin'), and 「より」. It highlights that \"even compared to the original fact of (A), (B)\" is true. Often, (A) is obvious or the most well-known information about the topic.\n\n「はもとより」 follows nouns or verb phrases nominalized with 「の」 or 「こと」. It can also show that (A) is the base from which (B) is also a fact, translating to \"from the start, (A) is (B)\" or \"by nature, (A) is (B).\" Context clarifies which meaning is intended. It's a formal expression used in written or formal spoken Japanese.",
