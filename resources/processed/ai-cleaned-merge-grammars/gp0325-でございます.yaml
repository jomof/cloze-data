    "etymology": "「でございます」 is a polite form of 「です」. 「ござる」 is an older verb meaning \"to be\" or \"to exist,\" and 「ございます」 is its polite form. The 「で」 part comes from the particle 「で」, which indicates the manner or state of something. Over time, 「でございます」 became a set phrase used to express politeness.",
    "writeup": "「でございます」 is an extremely polite way to say 「です」 (\"to be\"). It is primarily used in formal situations such as business settings or when speaking to superiors or customers. While 「です」 is already polite, 「でございます」 adds an extra layer of respect and formality. You might hear it commonly in customer service, formal presentations, or when someone wants to show utmost deference.\n\nWhile 「でござる」 is the dictionary form of 「でございます」, its use in modern Japanese is mainly limited to historical dramas, to portray characters with a unique or old-fashioned persona, or in very specific, highly formalized traditional contexts. It is not generally used in everyday speech.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Using 「でございます」 to introduce oneself or refer to inanimate objects or concepts is considered very polite and appropriate. For example, 「私が担当の〇〇でございます。」 (\"I am 〇〇, in charge.\")\n*   However, when referring to *other* people, it is generally more appropriate to use honorific language (尊称語, *sonkeigo*) such as 「いらっしゃる」. For instance, instead of saying 「田中さんは先生でございます。」, it would be more respectful to say 「田中先生でいらっしゃいます。」 or 「田中先生がお見えになりました。」.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To ensure proper usage, remember that 「でございます」 sits at the pinnacle of everyday politeness, reserved for business, formal settings, or situations demanding utmost respect when referring to yourself or things. 「です」 is your versatile, standard polite form suitable for most general interactions. Conversely, 「だ」 is strictly for intimate or very casual contexts. Most importantly, when the subject is a respected person, always prioritize using honorific verbs like 「いらっしゃいます」 to convey their presence or actions, as it specifically elevates the subject of the sentence, which 「でございます」 does not.",
