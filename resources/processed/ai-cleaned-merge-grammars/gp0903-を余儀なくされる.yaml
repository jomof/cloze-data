        "[Noun] + を余儀なくされる": "Indicates that someone is forced to do something, or has no other choice but to do something."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を余儀なくされる」 is derived from 「余儀ない」 (yoginai), which means \"inevitable\" or \"unavoidable.\" The 「を」 particle marks the object of the action being forced, and 「される」 is the passive form of 「する」 (to do), indicating that the subject is being acted upon. Thus, the entire expression conveys the sense of being compelled or forced into a certain action or situation.",
    "writeup": "「を余儀なくされる」 is a formal Japanese grammar pattern typically translated as \"to be forced to do (A)\" or \"to have no choice but to do (A).\" It comprises the particle 「を」, the noun 「余儀」 (another method), the conjunctive form 「なく」 of the *i*-adjective 「ない」 (nai), and the passive form 「される」 (sareru) of 「する」 (suru, to do). Literally, it means \"to not be given another way than to (A).\" This pattern follows a noun (A), which represents the unavoidable action. The subject is usually a person or an entity representing people, such as a company. However, there are exceptions.\n\n**Important Note:** 「を余儀なくされる」 (to be forced to do) and 「を余儀なくさせる」 (to force to do) are related but distinct. The latter will be addressed separately.\n\n「余儀なく」 is often perceived as a single word meaning \"unavoidably\" or \"inevitably,\" despite its components 「余儀」 and 「ない」.",
