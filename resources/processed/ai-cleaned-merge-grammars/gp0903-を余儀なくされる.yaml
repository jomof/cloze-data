    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を余儀なくされる」 is composed of: 「を」 (object marker), 「余儀」 (another method, alternative), 「なく」 (conjunctive form of the adjective 「ない」, meaning 'without'), and 「される」 (passive form of 「する」, to do). Thus, it literally translates to 'to be made to do something without any other alternative'. 「余儀ない」 itself is often considered a single word meaning 'unavoidable' or 'inevitable'.",
    "writeup": "「を余儀なくされる」 is a formal grammar pattern typically translated as \"to be forced to do (A)\". It signifies that there is no other option or choice available. The structure involves the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「余儀」 ('another method'), the conjunctive form 「なく」 of the adjective 「ない」, and the passive form 「される」 of the verb 「する」. Literally, it means \"to not be given another way than to (A)\". It's generally used after a noun, indicating what action is unavoidable. The subject is often a person or an entity representing people, such as a company.",
