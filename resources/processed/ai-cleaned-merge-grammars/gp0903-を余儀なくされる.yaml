        "usage-context": "Used in formal contexts, especially in news, official reports, or academic writing, to describe situations where an action is taken due to external, unavoidable circumstances.",
        "function": "To indicate that an action or state is compelled or unavoidable due to external circumstances, where there is no other option.",
        "nuance": "Implies a strong sense of external compulsion rather than a personal lack of alternatives. The subject is forced into a situation beyond their control. Often used in passive voice to emphasize the external force.",
        "colocation": "Often precedes actions or states that are undesirable or challenging, such as '閉鎖 (heisa - closure)', '中止 (chuushi - cancellation)', '避難 (hinan - evacuation)', '辞任 (jinin - resignation)', '変更 (henkou - change)'.",

    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を余儀なくされる」 is composed of: 「を」 (object marker), 「余儀」 (another method, alternative), 「なく」 (conjunctive form of the adjective 「ない」, meaning 'without'), and 「される」 (passive form of 「する」, to do). Thus, it literally translates to 'to be made to do something without any other alternative'. 「余儀ない」 itself is often considered a single word meaning 'unavoidable' or 'inevitable'.",
    "writeup": "「を余儀なくされる」 is a formal grammar pattern typically translated as \"to be forced to do (A)\". It signifies that there is no other option or choice available. The structure involves the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「余儀」 ('another method'), the conjunctive form 「なく」 of the adjective 「ない」, and the passive form 「される」 of the verb 「する」. Literally, it means \"to not be given another way than to (A)\". It is generally used after a noun, indicating what action is unavoidable. The subject is often a person or an entity representing people, such as a company.\n\n**Caution**: Both 「を余儀なくされる」 ('to be forced to do') and 「を余儀なくさせる」 ('to force to do') are variations of the same grammar structure. 「を余儀なくさせる」 will be taught in a different lesson.\n\n**Fun Fact**: Despite 「余儀」 and 「ない」 being separate words, 「余儀なく」 is often thought of simply as a single word that means 'unavoidably' or 'inevitably'.",
