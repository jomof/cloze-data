jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  usage-context: Used to express the speaker's firm intention or plan, often with a sense of determination
    or a fixed purpose. It is typically used for one's own intentions.
  function: Expresses intention or strong resolution.
  nuance: While Verb[volitional-よう]+思う expresses a "thought" or "consideration" of doing something, つもりだ
    indicates a more concrete "plan" or "intention". It implies a stronger resolve and that the speaker
    has already made up their mind. Unlike [Noun・Adjective]のつもりだ, this form solely focuses on future actions
    or plans, not beliefs about current states.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a fixed expression modifying a verb to convey the speaker's intentionality.
etymology: The word 「つもり」 originates from 「積もり」, the noun form of the verb 「積もる」 (tsumoru), meaning 'to
  pile up' or 'to accumulate'. This suggests that one's intention or plan is something that has 'piled
  up' or 'gathered' within them, representing a solid resolve rather than a fleeting thought. Historically,
  it evolved to convey a definite purpose or a fixed mind-set, distinguishing it from simpler expressions
  of desire or thought. It implies a strong internal commitment or resolve.
writeup: |-
  「つもりだ」 is used to express a speaker's firm intention or plan to do something. It indicates a stronger sense of resolve and a more concrete plan than simply stating a desire with 「たい」 or a casual thought with 「Verb[volitional-よう] と思う」.

  It is formed by attaching 「つもりだ」 directly after a verb in its dictionary (plain non-past) form to express a positive intention, or after a verb in its 「ない」 form to express a negative intention. The copula 「だ」 at the end conjugates like a regular copula (e.g., 「です」 for polite, 「だった」 for plain past, 「でした」 for polite past).

  For example, if you say 「日本語を勉強しようと思います。」, it means "I think I'll study Japanese," indicating a gentle statement of intent. However, 「日本語を勉強するつもりです。」 conveys a firmer decision, meaning "I intend to study Japanese."

  This expression is highly personal, reflecting the speaker's internal decision or resolve. Therefore, it is most commonly used for one's own intentions. While you might infer someone else's intentions based on their actions, directly stating another person's 「つもりだ」 is generally avoided unless you are quoting them or they have clearly communicated their fixed plan.
false_friends:
  - term: よてい (plan schedule)
    meaning: Plan to, intend to.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「予定だ」 focuses on a fixed schedule or arrangement, implying a plan that is often external or
      less about personal will. In contrast, 「つもりだ」 emphasizes the speaker's personal intention or resolve,
      indicating a stronger internal commitment.
    grammar_point: よてい (plan schedule)
  - term: はずだ (expected to be)
    meaning: Bound to (be), expected to (be), should be (able).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はずだ」 implies an expectation or likelihood based on external information, rules, or common
      sense. It's about what *should* happen. 「つもりだ」, however, expresses the speaker's intention or strong
      conviction, focusing on what the speaker *wills* or *believes*.
    grammar_point: はずだ (expected to be)
  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う (intend to or think I will)
    meaning: I think I will; I'm thinking of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜よう と思う」 expresses a nascent thought or a tentative consideration about doing something.
      It's a spontaneous decision or a weak intention. 「つもりだ」 indicates a stronger, more definite intention
      or plan, implying a deeper resolve than a mere thought.
    grammar_point: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う (intend to or think I will)
  - term: '[Noun・Adjective]のつもりだ (believe that one is・acting as if)'
    meaning: To believe one is something; to act as if one is something, often implying a discrepancy
      between belief and reality.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While sharing the common word 「つもり」, this usage expresses a belief or assumption about one's
      state, identity, or action, often implying that the reality might be different. The meaning of 'intention'
      for a future action is absent. This form does not follow a plain verb form, but a noun or adjective.
    grammar_point: '[Noun・Adjective]のつもりだ (believe that one is・acting as if)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「つもりだ」, 「予定だ」, 「はずだ」, and 「〜よう と 思う」 all relate to future actions or
  states, their core nuances differ significantly. 「つもりだ」, when used with verbs, expresses a personal,
  firm intention. 「予定だ」 is for scheduled plans, 「はずだ」 for expectations, and 「〜よう と 思う」 for initial thoughts.
  Understanding these distinctions will greatly enhance the naturalness and precision of your Japanese
  communication. It is also critical to differentiate the verb-modifying 「つもりだ」 from the noun/adjective-modifying
  「[Noun・Adjective]のつもりだ」, which conveys conviction rather than intention.

          decision and active resolve not to do something. We're looking for a strong negative intention.
    scene: A person feeling overwhelmed after a busy day expresses their desire to be alone for the rest
      of it.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: Used in a casual register, often to oneself or a close confidant, 「会う つもり は ない」 conveys a
      firm personal decision and strong resolve not to meet anyone, indicating a clear boundary or desire
      for solitude after an overwhelming day. This reflects a personal, internal choice.

          intent behind that action. We're asking about the intention, not just the action.

    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「つもりはないの？」 indicates a strong questioning of the listener's firm intention (or

      slightly while still conveying surprise or concern about the lack of intention.

        english: Please don't work overtime late tonight.

          intention. We're looking for a statement about the speaker's intention.
    scene: A busy employee is leaving the office, expressing their decision to a colleague who is still
      working.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「つもり は ありません」 conveys a firm, active decision not to work overtime, setting a personal
      boundary. The polite form 「ありません」 makes it appropriate for a friendly yet professional interaction
      with a colleague. The phrase indicates the speaker's conscious choice rather than just a statement
      of fact.

        english: I was thinking of buying a new computer, but I ran out of money.
        hint: The past form of 「つもりだ」, 「つもりだった」, indicates a past intention that did not materialize.
          「思っていた」 indicates a past thought that might not have been a firm plan. We are expressing a past
          firm intention that was thwarted.
    scene: Explaining why a planned purchase didn't happen.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)

      a sense of disappointment or a change of plans. The casual tone is suitable for discussing personal
      setbacks.

    japanese:

        english: I shouldn't have said such a rude thing.
        hint: 「はずはなかった」 expresses that something shouldn't have happened based on expectation or common
          sense, not a lack of personal intention. We're looking for a statement about the absence of
          personal intention.
    scene: A person expresses sincere regret and clarifies their true feelings after accidentally offending
      someone with their words.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The phrase 「言う つもり は なかった」 is a strong declaration of lacking prior intent, which is crucial
      in apologies. It highlights that the offense was unintentional. The casual register is appropriate
      when expressing genuine personal regret among familiar individuals or in a general statement.
  - english: I had no intention of making you feel uncomfortable.
    japanese:
      - あなた に 不快 な 思い を さ せる {つもり} は あり ませ ん でし た。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あなた に 不快 な 思い を さ せ {て しまい} まし た。
          - あなた に 不快 な 思い を さ せ {て しまっ} た。
        english: I ended up making you feel uncomfortable.
        hint: This phrase expresses regret for having caused discomfort, but it doesn't explicitly state
          the absence of prior intention. We're looking for a statement about the lack of intention.
    scene: A man sincerely apologizes to his female colleague after a misunderstanding or an unintentional
      slight.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「つもり は ありませんでした」 combined with the polite form 「ありませんでした」 conveys genuine remorse
      and respect, especially when a male speaker is addressing a female colleague in an apologetic context.
      The phrase indicates that the negative outcome was entirely unintentional on the speaker's part,
      emphasizing the internal state. The addition of 「ご」 in 「ご不快」 elevates the politeness, making it
      more formal.
  - english: So, what exactly are you planning to do now?
    japanese:
      - で、一体、今 から どう する {つもり な の}？
      - で、一体、今 から どう する {つもり です か}？
      - 今 から 何 を する {つもり}？
    english_literally: So, on earth, now from how do intend (question particle)?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - で、一体、今 から どう しよう と 思っ て いる の？
        english: So, what on earth are you thinking of doing now?
        hint: 「つもりなの？」 is a direct question about someone's definite plan or intention, often implying
          a sense of urgency or expectation. 「と思っているの？」 is a softer inquiry about a thought. We need a
          more pointed question about the firm plan.
    scene: A frustrated parent asking their child about their next steps after a mistake.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「つもりなの？」 is a casual but direct question about a definite plan, often used by an
      older person (e.g., parent) to a younger one (e.g., child) when seeking a concrete answer. The 「一体」
      adds a sense of exasperation, implying 'what on earth do you intend to do?'
  - english: He seems to intend to accept the new job offer.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 新しい 仕事 の 申し出 を 受ける {つもり らしい}。
      - 彼 は 新しい 仕事 の 申し出 を 受ける {つもり らしい です}。
    english_literally: He as for new job offer accept intend seems.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 新しい 仕事 の 申し出 を 受けよう と 思っ て いる らしい。
        english: He seems to be thinking of accepting the new job offer.
        hint: Adding 「らしい」 to 「つもりだ」 conveys that the intention is 'apparent' or 'hearsay'. 「と思っているらしい」
          suggests an apparent thought, which is less definite than an apparent intention. We're expressing
          what seems to be his clear intention.
    scene: Colleagues gossiping about a mutual acquaintance's career move.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: Here, 「つもりらしい」 combines a firm intention with an indication that this information is based
      on observation or rumor (the nuance of 「らしい」). This makes the statement less of a direct fact and
      more of a strong inference about his intent. The informal register is typical for office gossip.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in these examples, 「つもりだ」 covers a wide range of contexts for expressing
  deliberate intention regarding future actions. Pay close attention to the preceding verb form and the
  chosen politeness level to grasp the precise nuance. The flexibility of its conjugations also allows
  it to be used across various social situations, from casual conversations to more formal explanations.
