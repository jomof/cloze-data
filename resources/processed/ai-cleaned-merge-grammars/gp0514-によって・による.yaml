    "etymology": "The expressions 「によって」, 「による」, and 「により」 all stem from the verb 「よる」. This verb carries meanings such as \"to depend on,\" \"to be based on,\" \"to approach,\" or \"to come from.\" The particle 「に」 signifies the base, origin, or cause. Therefore, at its core, this grammar point signifies being \"based on\" or \"depending on\" something. While 「よる」 is predominantly written in hiragana in these grammatical constructions, it has several kanji forms like 拠る (to be based on), 因る (to be due to), 依る (to depend on), and 由る (to stem from), all reflecting the nuanced meanings conveyed by these expressions.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「によって・による」 is a versatile expression indicating various relationships between entities: **means or method**, **cause or reason**, **agent of an action (especially in passive constructions)**, and **dependency or variability**. While 「によって」, 「による」, and 「により」 are variations of the same underlying concept derived from the verb 「よる」, their usage differs slightly in terms of grammatical function and formality.\n\n*   **によって**:\n    This form typically functions adverbially, connecting a preceding noun (the means, cause, or basis) to the following clause. It is frequently followed by a comma, acting as a conjunction-like element between the cause/basis and the effect/result. It often translates to \"by means of,\" \"through,\" or \"because of.\"\n\n*   **による**:\n    This form primarily functions as an attributive, modifying a noun that follows it. It specifies that the subsequent noun is a result of, caused by, or dependent on the preceding noun. It often translates to \"due to,\" \"caused by,\" \"depending on,\" or \"resulting from.\" When placed at the end of a sentence, it often acts as a predicate expressing dependency, similar to \"It depends on...\"\n\n*   **により**:\n    This is a more formal and somewhat literary variant, functioning similarly to 「によって」 as a connective. It often implies a cause, means, or basis, and is commonly found in written documents, formal speeches, or legal texts. It can translate as \"by,\" \"due to,\" or \"according to.\"\n\nThese forms are widely used in general contexts (`一般`) and are standard in register. Mastery involves understanding their specific grammatical roles in a sentence.",
