    "etymology": "The grammar point is derived from the verb 「よる」 (yoru), which means \"to depend on\" or \"to be based on.\" The 「に」 (ni) particle indicates the point of dependence or the means by which something is achieved. Thus, 「によって」 literally signifies \"depending on (something)\" or \"by means of (something).\"",
    "writeup": "「によって」, 「による」, and 「により」 are variations of the same grammar point, generally translating to \"according to,\" \"depending on,\" \"by means of,\" or \"due to.\" They connect a cause or condition (A) to a result or consequence (B).\n\n*   「によって」 typically appears before a comma, acting as a separator between (A) and (B). It combines the particle 「に」 with the て-form of the verb 「よる」.\n*   「による」 often concludes a sentence, emphasizing that the preceding statement relies on (A). It can also modify a noun, indicating that the noun resulted from (A).\n*   「により」, similar to 「によって」, is usually found before a comma and uses the conjunctive form of 「よる」.",
