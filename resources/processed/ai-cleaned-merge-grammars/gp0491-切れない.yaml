        "part-of-speech": "auxiliary adjective",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "General usage in everyday conversation and various contexts. Applicable across various registers depending on the preceding verb's form.",
        "function": "To express the inability to complete an action due to overwhelming quantity, intensity, or emotional burden, or to do something to a satisfactory degree.",
        "nuance": "Implies that an action cannot be fully accomplished, often because there is too much of something (e.g., quantity, intensity, or emotional burden) or because it cannot be performed to a satisfactory degree. It carries a sense of an action reaching its limit due to overwhelming factors rather than a simple lack of ability. This can apply to physical actions, mental states, or emotional expressions. It differentiates from simple potential negatives by emphasizing the 'to completion' aspect."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「切れない」 combines the verb 「切る」(kiru, to cut/finish) in its stem form with the negative auxiliary 「ない」(nai, not). Literally, it suggests an inability to 'cut through' or 'finish off' an action. Over time, this evolved to imply that something cannot be completed, often because the quantity or intensity of the task or emotion is too overwhelming.",
    "writeup": "「切れない」, *kirenai*, is used to express the idea that an action cannot be finished or completed. It is formed by attaching 「切れない」 to the *masu-stem* form of another verb. This structure implies that the verb's action cannot be carried out to its completion.\n\nThis grammar point primarily conveys two nuances:\n\n1.  **Inability due to overwhelming quantity or intensity:** This indicates that there is **too much** of something to handle, making it impossible to finish or process entirely. For example, if there are too many items to count, too much food to eat, or an emotion is too intense to suppress.\n\n2.  **Inability to perform to a satisfactory degree:** This implies that an action cannot be performed to a **satisfactory extent** or achieved fully. It can arise when expressing profound emotions that are difficult to articulate completely, or when an anticipation is impossible to contain fully.\n\nWhile 「切れない」 itself doesn't strictly adhere to a single register, its usage adapts to the context and the preceding verb's conjugation, making it versatile across casual to polite speech. The core meaning, however, always revolves around an unachieved completion.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「切れない」, which indicates an inability to complete, 「てしまう」 implies an action has been completed, often with a sense of regret or accidental finality. It can also mean finishing something completely, directly contrasting the unfulfilled nature of 「切れない」. For example, 「食べてしまった」 (I ate it all / I accidentally ate it) versus 「食べ切れない」 (I can't finish eating it)."

            "nuance": "While 「かねる」 also expresses inability, it often implies a sense of hesitation, difficulty due to politeness, or inherent impracticality, rather than the overwhelming quantity or intensity often associated with 「切れない」. 「致しかねます」 (I cannot do it, politely) is different from 「やり切れない」 (I cannot finish doing it [because there's too much])."

            "nuance": "「〜得ない」 (e-nai) is more formal and typically indicates an inherent or logical impossibility, or a strong unlikelihood. It does not carry the connotation of an overwhelming quantity or emotional burden that prevents completion, which is characteristic of 「切れない」. For example, 「理解し得ない」 (cannot understand/unfathomable) vs. 「理解し切れない」 (cannot fully understand/grasp [due to complexity or volume of information])."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When differentiating 「切れない」 from similar expressions, remember that 「切れない」 specifically points to the inability to *complete* an action because there's too much of something – too much to eat, too many to count, or emotions too strong to fully control. Expressions like 「てしまう」 or 「上がる」 signify completion. While 「かねる」 and 「〜得ない」 also convey inability, they do so with different nuances: 「かねる」 often suggests a polite refusal or practical difficulty, and 「〜得ない」 denotes an inherent or logical impossibility, rather than an overwhelming amount or intensity.",

The core idea is that the task, quantity, or emotional burden is simply too much to be fully managed or brought to a satisfying conclusion by the speaker.",
