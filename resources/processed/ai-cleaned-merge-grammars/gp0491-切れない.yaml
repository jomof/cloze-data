    "etymology": "The grammar point 「切れない」 combines the verb 「切る」(kiru, to cut/finish) in its stem form with 「ない」(nai, not). Thus, literally, it means \"cannot cut/finish\". The nuance is that something cannot be completed, often because there is too much of something.",
    "writeup": "「切れない」, *kirenai*, is used to express the idea that an action cannot be finished or completed, often due to an overwhelming quantity or intensity. It is formed by attaching the negative-potential form 「切れない」 to the *masu-stem* (連用形, *ren'yōkei*) of a verb. This structure implies that the verb's action cannot be carried out to its completion. \n\nTypically, this indicates that there is **too much** of something to handle, making it impossible to finish. For example, if there are too many items to count, or too much food to eat. \n\nFurthermore, 「切れない」 can also convey that an action cannot be performed to a **satisfactory degree**, implying a sense of inability to achieve complete fulfillment or resolution. This nuance often arises when expressing deep emotions that are difficult to articulate fully, or anticipation that is impossible to contain.",
