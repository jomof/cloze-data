    "etymology": "The grammar point 「切れない」 combines the potential form of the verb 「切る」 (kiru, to cut), which implies the ability to cut or finish, with the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 (nai). Thus, literally, it means \"cannot cut\" or \"cannot finish.\" Over time, it evolved to express the inability to complete an action, often implying that there is too much to handle or that a satisfactory conclusion is unattainable.",
    "writeup": "「切れない」 is the negative potential form, attached to the conjunctive form (ます-stem) of a verb, expressing that a particular action is \"unable to be completed\".  It suggests that the action (A) cannot be completed because there is too much of something to finish it, or that something cannot be done to the point of satisfaction. The feeling of dissatisfaction is what the speaker considers too much to overcome.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「切れない」 often implies a sense of being overwhelmed or unable to cope with the quantity or intensity of something.\n*   It can also convey a feeling of frustration or inadequacy when used to express an inability to reach a desired level of completion or satisfaction.",
