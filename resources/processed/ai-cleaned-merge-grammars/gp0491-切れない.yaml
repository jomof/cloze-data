    "etymology": "The grammar point 「切れない」 combines the verb 「切る」(kiru, to cut/finish) in its stem form with 「ない」(nai, not). Thus, literally, it means \"cannot cut/finish\". The nuance is that something cannot be completed, often because there is too much of something.",
    "writeup": "「切れない」, *kirenai*, is used to express the idea that something cannot be finished or completed, often due to an excess of something. It's the negative-potential form of 「切る」(*kiru*, to cut, to finish). It attaches to the stem of a verb. It implies that the action is 'unable to be completed'. This is often because there is too much of something in order to finish it. It may also imply that something cannot be done 'to the point of satisfaction'. In this case, the feeling of dissatisfaction is what the speaker considers too much to overcome. \n\nThink of it this way: you're trying to cut through something, but there's just too much of it to cut through completely.",
