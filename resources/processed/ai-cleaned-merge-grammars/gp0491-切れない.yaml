    "meaning": "Being unable to finish or complete",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "auxiliary adjective",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "General usage in everyday conversation and various contexts.",
        "function": "To express the inability to complete an action due to overwhelming quantity, intensity, or emotional burden, or to do something to a satisfactory degree.",
        "nuance": "Implies that an action cannot be fully accomplished, often because there is too much of something (e.g., quantity, intensity, or emotional burden) or because it cannot be performed to a satisfactory degree."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「切れない」 combines the verb 「切る」(kiru, to cut/finish) in its stem form with 「ない」(nai, not). Thus, literally, it means \"cannot cut/finish\". The nuance is that something cannot be completed, often because there is too much of something.",
    "writeup": "「切れない」, *kirenai*, is used to express the idea that an action cannot be finished or completed. It is formed by attaching 「切れない」 to the *masu-stem* (連用形, *ren'yōkei*) of another verb. This structure implies that the verb's action cannot be carried out to its completion.\n\nThis grammar point primarily conveys two nuances:\n\n1.  **Inability due to overwhelming quantity or intensity:** This indicates that there is **too much** of something to handle, making it impossible to finish or process entirely. For example, if there are too many items to count, too much food to eat, or an emotion is too intense to suppress.\n\n2.  **Inability to perform to a satisfactory degree:** This implies that an action cannot be performed to a **satisfactory extent** or achieved fully. It can arise when expressing profound emotions that are difficult to articulate completely, or when an anticipation is impossible to contain fully.\n\nWhile 「切れない」 itself doesn't strictly adhere to a single register, its usage adapts to the context and the preceding verb's conjugation, making it versatile across casual to polite speech. The core meaning, however, always revolves around an unachieved completion.",
