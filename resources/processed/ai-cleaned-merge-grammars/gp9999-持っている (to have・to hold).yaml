jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express the state of having something, either physically holding it or possessing
    it as property or a quality/skill.
  function: Describes current possession or the result of a completed action (to hold).
  nuance: Implies an active state of possession or holding, differentiating it from mere existence. It
    can refer to physical objects, money, skills, or characteristics.
  grammatical-role: Functions as the predicate of a sentence, describing the subject's state.
etymology: The verb 「持つ」 (motsu) originally meant 'to take in hand,' 'to grasp,' or 'to carry.' Over time,
  with the addition of the auxiliary verb 「〜ている」, which denotes a continuous action or a resultant state,
  the phrase 「持っている」 evolved to describe both the literal act of 'being in the state of holding' and the
  broader sense of 'possessing' something, whether physically or abstractly (like a skill or characteristic).
  This evolution mirrors how 'to hold' in English can also mean 'to possess' (e.g., 'to hold property').
writeup: "「持っている」 is a fundamental expression in Japanese that conveys the meaning of 'to have' or 'to\
  \ possess,' as well as 'to be holding' something. It is formed by taking the て-form of the verb 「持つ」\
  \ (motsu, to hold/to have) and attaching 「いる」 (iru, to exist for animate objects). \n\n**Two Primary\
  \ Meanings:**\n1.  **To be physically holding or carrying something:** This is the more literal meaning,\
  \ where the action of holding is ongoing.\n    *   For example, 「彼は本を{持っている}」 means \"He is holding\
  \ a book.\"\n2.  **To possess something (property, money, skills, characteristics):** This meaning refers\
  \ to a resultant state where someone 'has' or 'owns' something, often not physically in hand at that\
  \ moment.\n    *   For example, 「私は車を{持っている}」 means \"I have a car.\" (I own a car).\n\n**Important\
  \ Considerations:**\n*   While 「持っている」 can refer to possessing money or tangible assets, it is generally\
  \ preferred over 「ある」 when emphasizing personal ownership or the act of having acquired something. For\
  \ example, 「お金を{持っている}」 (I have money) sounds more like 'I have money on me' or 'I possess money' in\
  \ a personal sense, whereas 「お金がある」 (There is money / Money exists) can be more general or impersonal.\n\
  *   For skills or characteristics, 「持っている」 is commonly used: 「彼は特別な才能を{持っている}」 (He has a special talent).\n\
  *   It is crucial to distinguish 「持っている」 from 「いる」 or 「ある」 when talking about the existence of things.\
  \ 「持っている」 specifically denotes possession by a subject, while 「ある」 simply states the inanimate existence\
  \ of something, and 「いる」 states the animate existence."
false_friends:
  - term: ある (to exist, inanimate・to have)
    meaning: to exist (inanimate), to have
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ある」 expresses simple existence or possession of inanimate objects, often without implying
      active holding or a strong personal connection to the item. It's more about "there is" or "I have"
      in a detached sense. 「持っている」 implies active possession, often gained or acquired, and can apply
      to things being physically held or owned. For abstract things, 「持っている」 often implies a skill or
      quality one "has" or "possesses."
    grammar_point: ある (to exist, inanimate・to have)
  - term: いる (to exist, animate)
    meaning: to exist (animate)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「いる」 is used for the existence of animate beings (people, animals). While you can say 「犬を飼っている」
      (I own a dog) or 「犬がいる」 (There is a dog), you would only use 「犬を{持っている}」 if literally physically
      holding a dog. It's not typically used for pet ownership in the same way 「ある」 is used for inanimate
      object possession.
    grammar_point: いる (to exist, animate)
  - term: 所有している (to own)
    meaning: to own, to possess (formally)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「所有している」 is a more formal and legalistic term for ownership, often used for property, companies,
      or large assets. 「持っている」 is more general and can refer to anything from physically holding an object
      to having a skill or a small personal item. It is not generally used for abstract possessions like
      skills.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:所有している (to own)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To differentiate these expressions: Use 「持っている」 when you want to emphasize
  that someone ''has'' or ''possesses'' something, whether physically holding it or owning it as a personal
  belonging or quality. Use 「ある」 for general inanimate existence or when stating that money or items are
  simply present. Use 「いる」 for the existence of people and animals. 「所有している」 conveys a formal, legal sense
  of ownership.'
examples:
  - english: She is holding a red umbrella.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 赤い 傘 を {持っ て いる}。
      - 彼女 は 赤い 傘 を {持っ て い ます}。
      - 彼女、赤い 傘 {持っ てる}。
    english_literally: She, a red umbrella, is holding.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 赤い 傘 が ある。
        english: She has a red umbrella (implying mere existence, not necessarily holding).
        hint: 「ある」 indicates inanimate existence. Here, we want to express the action of holding. We're
          looking for an active state of possession.
    scene: A woman is walking in the rain.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of 「持っている」 clearly indicates the physical action of holding the umbrella. The casual
      register is appropriate for a simple observational statement.
    etymology: The verb 持つ (motsu) originally referred to grasping something in one's hand, and the progressive/resultative
      form ている indicates the ongoing state of that action.
  - english: Do you have a driver's license?
    japanese:
      - 運転 免許 を {持っ て い ます} か？
      - 運転 免許 を {持っ て いる}？
      - 運転 免許 を {お 持ち です か}？
    english_literally: Driver's license, do you have?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 運転 免許 が あり ます か？
        english: Is there a driver's license (to you)?
        hint: While 「ある」 can mean 'to have,' it often implies impersonal existence. For personal possessions
          like a license, 「持っている」 is more common and natural. We're looking for personal possession.
    scene: A police officer is asking a driver.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The polite form 「持っていますか」 is used for a formal inquiry, appropriate for a police officer addressing
      someone. The sentence implies 'do you personally possess a license?' rather than 'does a license
      exist?'. An older speaker might use this polite form to maintain authority.
    etymology: In this context, 「持っている」 extends from physical holding to 'having' or 'possessing' a document
      or qualification, reflecting a common conceptual expansion in the language.
  - english: I don't have much money.
    japanese:
      - あまり お 金 を {持っ て い ない}。
      - あまり お 金 を {持っ て い ませ ん}。
      - あまり お 金 {持っ て ない}。
    english_literally: Not much money, don't have.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あまり お 金 が ない。
        english: There isn't much money.
        hint: While 「お金がない」 is grammatically correct for 'no money,' 「持っていない」 emphasizes the personal
          lack of possession, often implying 'I don't have it on me' or 'I don't possess it.' We're looking
          for a personal statement of not having.
    scene: A student is explaining why they can't go out.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The casual negative form 「持っていない」 is used between friends. The phrase 「あまりお金を{持っていない}」 is
      a natural way for a speaker, especially a younger person, to express a lack of funds in a personal
      and relatable way.
    etymology: The use of 「持っている」 for money highlights the personal possession of funds, stemming from
      the idea of physically 'holding' money, even if it's in a bank account.
  - english: He has a very strong sense of responsibility.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 責任 感 が とても 強い の を {持っ て いる}。
      - 彼 は 責任 感 が とても 強い の を {持っ て い ます}。
    english_literally: He, sense of responsibility, very strong, is having.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 責任 感 が とても 強い。
        english: He has a very strong sense of responsibility (descriptive).
        hint: While simply describing someone as having a strong sense of responsibility is fine, 「持っている」
          emphasizes that this is a quality they possess. We're looking for the sense of 'possessing'
          this quality.
    scene: A colleague is praising another's character.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Using 「持っている」 for an abstract quality like 責任感 (sense of responsibility) emphasizes that it's
      an inherent attribute the person possesses, rather than just a descriptive adjective. This is a
      common and natural usage in business or formal settings.
    etymology: This usage extends the concept of 'holding' to abstract qualities, where one 'holds' or
      'possesses' a certain characteristic, much like in English 'to have a quality'.
  - english: This company has innovative technology.
    japanese:
      - この 会社 は 革新 的 な 技術 を {持っ て いる}。
      - この 会社 は 革新 的 な 技術 を {持っ て い ます}。
    english_literally: This company, innovative technology, is having.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 会社 に は 革新 的 な 技術 が ある。
        english: This company has innovative technology (impersonal existence).
        hint: 「ある」 focuses on mere existence. 「持っている」 emphasizes that the company actively possesses or
          developed this technology. We're looking for an active sense of possession by the company.
    scene: A business analyst is describing a successful firm.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: When discussing entities like companies, 「持っている」 suggests that the company actively holds
      or controls the technology, implying a more dynamic relationship than simply stating its existence
      with 「ある」. The dictionary form is suitable for informative statements in an academic or professional
      setting, often from an older, knowledgeable speaker.
    etymology: The application of 「持っている」 to an organization's assets or capabilities is a natural extension
      of its meaning of possession.
  - english: I heard she doesn't have children.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 子供 を {持っ て い ない} そう だ。
      - 彼女 は 子供 を {持っ て い ませ ん} そう だ。
      - 彼女、子供 {持っ て ない} って。
    english_literally: She, children, doesn't have, I heard.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 子供 が い ない そう だ。
        english: I heard she doesn't have children (referring to animate existence).
        hint: While 「子供がいない」 is also correct and common, 「子供を{持っていない}」 is often used to specifically mean
          'she doesn't have *her own* children' or implies she hasn't 'had' children. We're looking for
          the nuance of 'not having had' or 'not possessing' children.
    scene: Two people are discussing a mutual acquaintance.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Although 「子供がいない」 is more common for simply stating one 'does not have children,' 「子供を{持っていない}」
      carries a nuance closer to 'has not had' or 'is not possessing (her own) children.' This usage can
      be heard in casual conversation, especially between female speakers discussing personal matters.
    etymology: This is a more sensitive usage, where 'holding' children extends metaphorically to the
      state of 'having' them as one's own offspring.
  - english: He never had a strong interest in art.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 芸術 に 強い 興味 を {持っ て い なかっ た}。
      - 彼 は 芸術 に 強い 興味 を {持っ て い ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: He, in art, strong interest, did not have.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 芸術 に 強い 興味 が なかっ た。
        english: He had no strong interest in art.
        hint: While 「興味がなかった」 is fine, 「持っていなかった」 emphasizes that he didn't *possess* that interest, perhaps
          implying a past state that contrasts with a present one, or simply a lack of personal engagement.
          We're looking for the nuance of 'not having' or 'not possessing' an interest.
    scene: A biography narrator describing an artist's early life.
    register: formal
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The past negative 「持っていなかった」 indicates a past state of not possessing a certain interest or
      quality. This formal narrative style is typical for biographies, providing factual information about
      the subject's past characteristics, often from an older, knowledgeable speaker.
    etymology: This use of 「持っている」 for abstract concepts like 'interest' or 'feelings' highlights the
      internalization of such concepts as something one 'holds' within oneself.
  - english: Please come back later, I'm holding something right now.
    japanese:
      - 今、物 を {持っ て い ます} の で、後 で また 来 て ください。
      - 今、物 を {持っ て いる} の で、後 で また 来 て ね。
    english_literally: Now, things, am holding, so, later please come again.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今、物 が ある の で、後 で また 来 て ください。
        english: Now, there are things, so please come again later.
        hint: 「ある」 would mean things simply exist. Here, the speaker wants to convey that they are physically
          occupied. We're looking for the active state of holding something.
    scene: A shopkeeper is busy carrying boxes.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The polite form 「持っています」 is appropriate for a shopkeeper addressing a customer. It clearly
      indicates a physical action of holding, explaining why they are currently unavailable. The use of
      「ので」 provides a polite reason. This politeness is characteristic of teineigo.
    etymology: This is a direct and literal application of the original meaning of 持つ (to hold), combined
      with ている to denote the ongoing action.
  - english: He doesn't have any weaknesses.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 何 の 弱点 も {持っ て い ませ ん}。
      - 彼 は 何 の 弱点 も {持っ て い ない}。
    english_literally: He, any weaknesses, doesn't have.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 に は 何 の 弱点 も あり ませ ん。
        english: He has no weaknesses (impersonal existence).
        hint: While 「ありません」 is grammatically fine, 「持っていません」 emphasizes the subject's personal characteristic
          or lack thereof. We're looking for the nuance of 'possessing' or 'not possessing' a quality.
    scene: A coach is describing a talented athlete.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Using 「持っていません」 for abstract concepts like 弱点 (weakness) highlights that these are qualities
      one possesses or lacks. The polite form is suitable for a coach speaking about their athlete to
      another professional.
    etymology: Similar to 'talent' or 'responsibility', 'weakness' is conceptualized as something a person
      'holds' or 'lacks', linking back to the idea of possession.
  - english: The child was holding his mother's hand and walking.
    japanese:
      - 子供 は 母親 の 手 を {持っ て い て}、歩い て い た。
      - 子供 は 母親 の 手 を {持っ て い まし て}、歩い て い まし た。
    english_literally: Child, mother's hand, holding, was walking.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 は 母親 の 手 を 掴ん で 歩い て い た。
        english: The child was grasping his mother's hand and walking.
        hint: While 「掴んで」 (tsukande) means 'grasping,' 「持っていて」 implies a sustained hold, often in a more
          gentle or continuous manner. We're looking for a continuous, perhaps gentler, holding action.
    scene: A parent is reminiscing about their child's younger days.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The て-form 「持っていて」 connects the action of holding hands to the action of walking, indicating
      they happened concurrently. This casual recounting style is typical for reflective personal stories,
      often shared by a female speaker about family.
    etymology: This is a straightforward use of the て-form of 持つ, indicating a continuous state of holding
      that serves as the background for another action.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「持っている」 is versatile, covering both literal physical holding
  and abstract possession. Pay attention to the context to understand which meaning is intended, and how
  it differs from similar expressions like 「ある」 and 「いる」 when discussing possession or existence.
