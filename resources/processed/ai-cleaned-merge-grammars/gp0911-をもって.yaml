        "usage-context": "Often used in official announcements, legal documents, formal speeches, and written communications to mark a clear point in time for cessation or to denote the means by which something is achieved. It is also used to formally conclude events or statements.",
        "function": "To mark a definitive point in time (often an end point) or to indicate the specific means/instrument by which an action is performed.",
        "nuance": "Carries a strong nuance of finality, officiality, or a distinct instrumentality. It elevates the statement to a more formal and authoritative level than general particles like で or によって. When referring to time, it almost exclusively marks an ending or a culmination, not a beginning.",

        "grammatical-role": "Adverbial phrase, modifying the verb or the entire clause.",
        "temporal-flow": "Typically marks the end or culmination of a period or event.",
        "spatial-flow": "Can imply a transition or a definitive boundary in time or circumstance."
    },
    "etymology": "「をもって」 comes from the kanji 「以て」 (もって), which originally meant \"by means of.\" It's related to the verb 「持つ」 (もつ), meaning \"to hold\" or \"to have.\" The nuance suggests \"having reached (A)\" or \"by means of (A)\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「をもって」 is a formal expression that can mean \"as of,\" \"with,\" or \"by means of.\" It's often used in official announcements, formal speech, and written documents. When used with expressions indicating time or an event at a specific time, it conveys 'as of (A)' or 'effective from (A)'. For example, 「本日をもって」 means \"as of today.\" It is a combination of the adverbial particle 「を」 and 「もって」, which originally meant \"by means of.\" In highly polite or official contexts, it may be rendered as 「をもちまして」. Less commonly, the small っ (促音, sokuon) may be dropped, resulting in 「をもて」. It is crucial to note that while \"effective from\" might imply a starting point in English, 「をもって」 primarily focuses on the **ending** or **completion** of something, or what has happened up until a specified end date. Therefore, it is generally **not** used to indicate a new beginning from a date that lacked prior significant events.",
