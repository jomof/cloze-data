    "etymology": "The grammar point 「をもって」 comes from the adverbial particle 「を」 and 「持って」, the te-form of the verb 「持つ」 (to hold, to have). Originally, it gained its nuance from 「持って」, which means 'to hold' or 'to have'. In this way, it may help to remember 「をもって」 as working in a similar way to 'having (A)' or 'having reached (A)' in English, used to signify the means or the time frame by which something is accomplished or concluded.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「をもって」 is often translated as \"as of (A)\" or \"effective from (A)\" when used with time-related expressions. It is a construction of the adverbial particle 「を」 and 「もって」, meaning \"by means of.\" 「をもって」 is used after nouns that indicate a time or an event that happens at a specific time.\n\nAs is frequently seen in polite speech or official notifications, 「をもって」 may sometimes be read as 「をもちまして」. Alternatively, the small 「っ」 (called a 促音) may occasionally be dropped, resulting in 「をもて」.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nAlthough \"effective from\" can have the nuance of \"starting\" in English, 「をもって」 primarily focuses on something ending or what has happened up until the end date specified. Because of this, it is **not** used to indicate that something is starting from a date that had nothing significant happen before it.",
