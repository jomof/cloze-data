        "[Noun] + をもって": "Indicates 'as of' or 'with' something, often related to time or means."

        "Usage": "硬い (stiff/hard), primarily used in formal or official contexts."
    },
    "etymology": "「をもって」 comes from the kanji 「以て」 (もって), which originally meant \"by means of.\" It's related to the verb 「持つ」 (もつ), meaning \"to hold\" or \"to have.\" The nuance suggests \"having reached (A)\" or \"by means of (A)\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「をもって」 is a formal expression that can mean \"as of,\" \"with,\" or \"by means of.\" It's often used in official announcements, formal speech, and written documents. When used with expressions indicating time or an event at a specific time, it conveys 'as of (A)' or 'effective from (A)'. For example, 「本日をもって」 means \"as of today.\" It is a combination of the adverbial particle 「を」 and 「もって」, which originally meant \"by means of.\" In highly polite or official contexts, it may be rendered as 「をもちまして」. Less commonly, the small っ (促音, sokuon) may be dropped, resulting in 「をもて」. It is crucial to note that while \"effective from\" might imply a starting point in English, 「をもって」 primarily focuses on the **ending** or **completion** of something, or what has happened up until a specified end date. Therefore, it is generally **not** used to indicate a new beginning from a date that lacked prior significant events.",
