    "writeup": "The grammar point 「をもって」 is a formal expression that can mean \"as of,\" \"with,\" or \"by means of.\" It's often used in official announcements, formal speech, and written documents. When used with time expressions, it indicates a specific end date or point. For example, 「本日をもって」 means \"as of today.\" 「をもって」 is a combination of the particle 「を」 and 「もって」, which originally meant \"by means of.\" It can also be read as 「をもちまして」 in very polite contexts or, less commonly, as 「をもて」.",
    "etymology": "「をもって」 comes from the kanji 「以て」 (もって), which originally meant \"by means of.\" It's related to the verb 「持つ」 (もつ), meaning \"to hold\" or \"to have.\" The nuance suggests \"having reached (A)\" or \"by means of (A)\".",
