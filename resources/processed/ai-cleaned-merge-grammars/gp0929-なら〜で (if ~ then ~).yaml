formation:
  Word + なら + Word + で: Expresses the speaker's opinion that if something is going to be done, it should
    be done properly or a certain way; or expresses dissatisfaction that something wasn't done sooner.
jlpt: N1
etymology: This pattern combines 「なら」 (if) with 「で」, which acts as a conjunction, emphasizing the condition
  and expectation of the repeated action. The repetition of the word serves to intensify the conditional
  aspect, suggesting that if the action or state is truly the case, then a certain consequence or expectation
  follows.
writeup: The 「なら〜で」 pattern is a structure where the same word is repeated twice, followed by some sort
  of opinion regarding that action or state. It can be translated as "if (A), you should (B)", or "before
  (A), you should (B)". In many cases, it is used to express the speaker's dissatisfaction about something.
  This pattern can follow verbs in their plain forms, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns. Both 「なら」
  and 「で」 function as conjunction particles in this grammar pattern. It is important to note that this
  nuance differs from other conditional structures like ば〜で, たら〜たで, and even another specific application
  of なら〜で itself. These other patterns are used when conveying that something either is or is not an issue
  in relation to the conditional (A). For instance, the latter なら〜で (without word repetition) typically
  appears following な-adjectives. The repetition in 「なら〜で」 emphasizes a strong expectation or mild exasperation,
  indicating that if the initial condition is true, then a certain action or outcome is expected or demanded.

  - term: ば〜で
    meaning: If ~ (then accepted), Even if ~
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「なら〜で」 which often implies dissatisfaction or strong opinion, 「ば〜で」 is used to state
      that if something is the case, it is accepted or there is no problem with it. For example, 「雨 なら
      雨 で 家 で ゲーム を すれば いい」 (If it rains, then we can just play games at home – no problem).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ば〜ばで (if... then it's accepted)
  - term: たら〜たで
    meaning: If ~ (then accepted), Even if ~
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Similar to 「ば〜で」, 「たら〜たで」 also indicates that even if a certain situation occurs, it is either
      accepted or not problematic, sometimes implying a mild resignation or a "can't be helped" attitude.
      For example, 「忙しかったら 忙しかった で、それ は それで 仕方がない」 (If you were busy, then being busy is just how it is
      – can't be helped).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:たら〜たらで (if... then it's accepted)
  - term: なら
    meaning: If, provided that
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「なら〜で」 which often implies dissatisfaction or strong opinion, 「なら」 simply states a
      condition without the added emphasis or emotional tone. For example, 「明日 雨 なら 家 に いよう」 (If it rains
      tomorrow, let's stay home) is a neutral conditional.
    grammar_point: なら (conditional, if it's the case that A)
post_false_friends_writeup: This grammar point is often confused with other conditional forms like 「ば〜で」
  and 「たら〜たで」. While those patterns also convey a conditional sense, they often imply that the outcome
  of the condition is not a problem, or is accepted as it is. In contrast, 「なら〜で」 with its repeated word
  emphasizes the speaker's strong opinion or dissatisfaction regarding the condition, urging that if something
  is to be done, it must be done properly, or expressing regret about how it was handled.

    nuance: The use of 「謝り なさい」 is a direct instruction, suitable for a superior addressing a subordinate.
      The repetition of 「謝る なら 謝る で」 conveys the manager's strong expectation that if an apology is offered,
      it should be genuine and complete, not perfunctory.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「なら〜で」 is used to convey a strong sense of expectation
  or mild dissatisfaction. It emphasizes that if a certain action or state is to occur, it should be done
  thoroughly and genuinely, otherwise, there's a missed opportunity or a sense of frustration.
