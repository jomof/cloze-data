    "etymology": "「確かに」 comes from the な-adjective 「確か (tashika)」, meaning \"certain\" or \"sure\". Adding 「に」 turns it into an adverb, intensifying the sense of certainty.",
    "writeup": "「確かに」 is the adverbial form of the *na*-adjective 「確か」, meaning \"certain\" or \"sure\". It functions similarly to \"certainly\", \"surely\", or \"indeed\" in English. It's often used when the speaker wants to emphasize that something is definitely the case.",
