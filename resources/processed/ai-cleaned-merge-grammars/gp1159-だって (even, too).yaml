  pronunciation:
    katakana: ダッテ
    romaji: datte
  formation:
    Noun + だって: Indicates 'too' or 'even' regarding the noun.
    Question word + だって: Implies 'any' or 'no matter' who/what/how.

  jlpt: N2
  details:
    part-of-speech: particle
    register: casual
    function: Expresses that something applies in addition to what was previously stated or emphasizes that
      something is true even in a certain circumstance. Can also indicate 'any' or 'no matter' when used
      with question words. Can also function as a casual equivalent of ～ても (even if/though).
    nuance: Often conveys a sense of slight impatience, surprise, or an insistent tone. It adds a stronger
      emphasis than も or でも in many cases.
    counterpoint: も, でも
  etymology: Originally a conjunctive particle meaning "because," the usage as 'too' or 'even' likely evolved
    from the nuance of providing a reason or justification. The question-word usage extends this to mean
    'for any reason' or 'in any case'. Its use as a casual form of ～ても suggests a contraction or phonetic
    shift from that conditional particle.
  writeup: |-
    The particle 「だって」 is a versatile expression primarily conveying the meaning of "too," "also," or "even." It is frequently encountered in informal, conversational Japanese, adding emphasis or indicating that something applies in addition to what has been previously stated or implied. It often highlights an an unexpected inclusion or assertion. For example, 「私だって」 means "even I" or "I too," suggesting a nuance of surprise or insistence.

    When 「だって」 is paired with question words such as 誰 (who), 何 (what), いつ (when), or どこ (where), it takes on the meaning of "any" or "no matter what/who/when/where." For instance, 「誰だって」 translates to "anyone" or "no matter who," implying universality without exception.

    Furthermore, 「だって」 can function as a more casual, colloquial alternative to the conditional particle 「～ても」 (even if/though) when attached to the plain past form of verbs or adjectives. This usage adds a sense of resignation, emphasis, or an acknowledgment of a condition despite its implications.

    It is important to note that while 「だって」 can often be interchangeable with 「も」 or 「でも」 in certain contexts, 「だって」 typically carries a stronger, more direct, and sometimes more emphatic tone, making it particularly effective in expressing surprise, slight impatience, or a firm assertion.

    - term: でも
      meaning: But, however; also even/any
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「だって」, when 「でも」 functions as a particle, it also means 'even' or 'any' (e.g., 「誰でも」
        - anyone). While often interchangeable with 「だって」 in such contexts, 「だって」 can carry a slightly stronger
        emphasis or imply a more surprising 'even' in conversational settings.
      grammar_point: でも (even・any・no matter)
    - term: も
      meaning: Also, too
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While similar to 「だって」, 「も」 is more general and doesn't carry the same emphatic nuance or
        implication of 'even' in unexpected situations that 「だって」 often does.
      grammar_point: も (addition or emphasis particle)
    - term: さえ
      meaning: Even; if only; as long as
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「さえ」 emphasizes an extreme or minimal case, often implying that if even this minimum is met,
        a certain outcome follows. It can also mark an additional, surprising element. 「だって」 is generally
        more conversational and broader in its 'even/too' application.
      grammar_point: さえ (even・if only)
    - term: すら
      meaning: Even
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「すら」 is a more formal or literary equivalent of 「さえ」, often used in negative contexts or to
        emphasize an extreme lack. 「だって」 is more common in spoken, casual contexts and can also convey 'too'
        or 'no matter'.
      grammar_point: すら (even)
    - term: にもかかわらず
      meaning: Despite, in spite of, regardless, nevertheless
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「だって」 can express 'even if' in a casual way, 「にもかかわらず」 is a more formal and explicit
        way to state 'despite' or 'in spite of', often highlighting a contrast between expectation and reality.
        It emphasizes a situation that exists regardless of obstacles.
      grammar_point: にもかかわらず (despite)
    - term: たとえ〜ても
      meaning: Even if…is the case, Supposing that
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: This is a more formal and explicit way to express 'even if' than the casual 「～だって」. 「たとえ〜ても」
        is used to set up a strong hypothetical or concession, often emphasizing that the outcome remains
        the same regardless of the condition.
      grammar_point: たとえ〜ても (even if)
  post_false_friends_writeup: |-
    While 「だって」, 「も」, and 「でも」 all express notions of inclusion or 'even', their nuances and usage contexts differ. 「も」 is a neutral particle of addition, simply meaning 'also' or 'too'. 「でも」, when used as a particle (e.g., 「誰でも」), means 'any' or 'even', often implying universality without strong emphasis on the unexpectedness. 「だって」, on the other hand, frequently carries a stronger, more direct, and sometimes surprising or assertive tone for 'even' or 'too', especially in conversational settings. It can also convey slight impatience or a firm assertion.

    Additionally, 「だって」 serves as a casual, colloquial equivalent of 「～ても」 (even if/though) when attached to plain forms of verbs or adjectives. In this function, it offers a more informal alternative to the standard conditional forms.

    Other particles like 「さえ」 and 「すら」 also mean 'even', but they typically emphasize an extreme or minimal case. 「さえ」 often implies that if even the most basic condition is met, a result follows, or it can highlight an additional, surprising element. 「すら」 is a more formal or literary variant of 「さえ」, often used with negative implications or to denote an extreme absence.

    For more formal expressions of 'despite' or 'even if', constructions like 「にもかかわらず」 and 「たとえ～ても」 are used. 「にもかかわらず」 explicitly states a situation that occurs contrary to expectations or despite obstacles. 「たとえ～ても」 is used to set up a strong hypothetical condition, emphasizing that the outcome remains the same regardless of the condition. In summary, 「だって」 offers a versatile, casual, and often emphatic way to express inclusion, 'even-ness', or concession, making it distinct from these other related particles and expressions through its tone and common usage.
  examples:
    - english: Even Yamada, the new employee, should be able to do this job.
      japanese:
        - 新入 社員 の 山田 さん {だ って}、この 仕事 なら できる はず だ よ。
        - 新入 社員 の 山田 さん {だ って}、この 仕事 なら できる はず だ。
        - 新入 社員 の 山田 さん {だ って}、この 仕事 なら できる はず です。
      english_literally: New employee Yamada, even, this job if it is, should be able to do it.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 新入 社員 の 山田 さん {も}、この 仕事 なら できる はず だ よ。
          english: Yamada, the new employee, should also be able to do this job.
          hint: 「も」 simply indicates "also" or "too" without the strong emphasis or slight surprise that
            「だって」 conveys. We're emphasizing that *even* Yamada can do it.
      scene: A team leader explaining a simple task to a senior colleague who doubts a new hire's ability.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      nuance: The phrase 「はず だ よ」 implies an expectation or certainty. The use of 「だって」 emphasizes that
        even someone like Yamada, who might be perceived as less capable, should be able to do it, conveying
        a slight sense of surprise or assertion. The casual tone suits the interaction between colleagues.
      etymology: The use of 「だって」 here as "even" draws on its emphatic function, highlighting an unexpected
        inclusion. It suggests "even if it's Yamada, it's possible."
    - english: I want to go with you too.
      japanese:
        - 僕 {だ って}、君 と 一緒 に 行き たい ん だ。
        - 私 {だ って}、あなた と 一緒 に 行き たい の よ。
        - 僕 {だ って}、君 と 一緒 に 行き たい ん だ ぞ。
        - 私 {だ って}、君 と 一緒 に 行き たい ん です。
      english_literally: I too, with you together, want to go.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 僕 {も}、君 と 一緒 に 行き たい ん だ。
          english: I also want to go with you.
          hint: 「も」 indicates simple inclusion ("also"). 「だって」 adds a stronger, more assertive or slightly
            demanding nuance of "me too!" especially in emotional contexts. We're looking for an insistent
            "I too."
      scene: A child begging to join an outing with an older sibling or parent.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The use of 「だって」 by a child implies a direct, emotional plea, highlighting their earnest wish
        to participate, as if to say, "Why can't I go too?" The masculine 「僕」 is common for boys, and the
        casual 「君」 for 'you' fits a child's address to a close family member.
      etymology: This usage of 「だって」, conveying a strong sense of 'me too!', is rooted in its emphatic particle
        function, often used to assert one's own inclusion in a situation where they might feel overlooked
        or excluded.
    - english: Everyone fears failure.
      japanese:
        - 誰 {だ って}、失敗 は 恐れる もの だ。
        - 誰 {だ って}、失敗 は 恐れる もの です。
        - 誰 {だ って}、失敗 を 恐れる もの だ。
        - 誰 {だ って}、失敗 は 怖い よ ね。
      english_literally: No matter who, failure is something to fear.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 誰 {で も}、失敗 は 恐れる もの だ。
          english: Anyone fears failure.
          hint: While 「誰でも」 also means "anyone," 「誰だって」 often carries a slightly more emphatic or comprehensive
            nuance, emphasizing that there are truly no exceptions. We're looking for an emphatic "everyone."
      scene: A mentor giving advice to a struggling student, encouraging them not to be ashamed of their
        fears.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: supportive
      nuance: When paired with a question word like 「誰」 (who), 「だって」 means 'anyone' or 'no matter who,'
        conveying a universal truth. The phrase 「恐れる もの だ」 (it's something to fear) adds a somewhat formal
        or philosophical tone suitable for a mentor.
      etymology: The combination of a question word with 「だって」 to mean 'any' or 'no matter' is a development
        of its function to encompass all possibilities within a given category, reflecting a sense of universality.
    - english: I'm always on your side, no matter when.
      japanese:
        - いつ {だ って}、あなた の 味方 だ から ね。
        - いつ {だ って}、あなた の 味方 です から ね。
        - いつ {だ って}、あなた の 味方 だ。
        - いつ {だ って}、君 の 味方 だ から ね。
      english_literally: No matter when, I am your ally, you know.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - いつ {で も}、あなた の 味方 だ から ね。
          english: I'm always on your side.
          hint: 「いつでも」 means "anytime" or "always." 「いつだって」 often carries a slightly stronger sense of unwavering
            consistency or emphasis on the universality of the time. We're looking for a firm "no matter
            when."
      scene: A supportive friend offering comfort to someone going through a tough time.
      register: casual
      setting: intimate
      nuance: The 「ね」 at the end softens the assertion and seeks gentle agreement or understanding, reinforcing
        the supportive nature of the statement. 「いつだって」 conveys a strong sense of enduring loyalty, implying
        'at any time, without exception.'
      etymology: Similar to its use with '誰', combining 「いつ」 (when) with 「だって」 creates a meaning of 'anytime'
        or 'always,' emphasizing a consistent and unwavering state or action.
    - english: Even on Sundays, urgent work can come in.
      japanese:
        - 日曜 日 {だ って}、緊急 の 仕事 が 入る こと が ある。
        - 日曜 日 {だ って}、緊急 の 仕事 が 入る こと が あり ます。
        - 日曜 日 {だ って}、急 な 仕事 が 入る こと は ある。
      english_literally: Sunday even, urgent work enters it happens.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 日曜 日 {で も}、緊急 の 仕事 が 入る こと が ある。
          english: Even on Sundays, urgent work can come in.
          hint: 「でも」 can mean "even" but 「だって」 often conveys a stronger sense of unexpectedness or an emphatic
            assertion for that particular day. We're highlighting the unexpectedness of Sunday being affected.
      scene: A busy professional explaining their irregular work schedule to a friend.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: serious
      nuance: 「だって」 here emphasizes that *even* a day usually reserved for rest, like Sunday, is not exempt
        from work, conveying a sense of mild frustration or resignation. The phrase 「こと が ある」 indicates
        that this is something that occasionally happens.
      etymology: This usage emphasizes an unexpected inclusion, implying 'even for Sundays, this applies.'
        It carries a stronger nuance than a simple 'also'.
    - english: Even he wouldn't accept such an unreasonable demand.
      japanese:
        - そんな 無理 な 要求 は、彼 {だ って} 受け入れ ない だろう。
        - そんな 無理 な 要求 は、彼 {だ って} 受け入れ ない でしょう。
        - そんな 無理 な 要求 は、彼 {だ って} 受け入れ は し ない だろう。
      english_literally: Such unreasonable demands, even he, would not accept.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - そんな 無理 な 要求 は、彼 {で も} 受け入れ ない だろう。
          english: Even he wouldn't accept such an unreasonable demand.
          hint: Both 「彼だって」 and 「彼でも」 convey "even he," but 「彼だって」 can imply a stronger emphasis on his
            specific situation or an unexpectedness that *even he* (who might be expected to be more agreeable)
            would not accept it. We're looking for that stronger emphasis.
      scene: Colleagues discussing a difficult negotiation, assuming a strong negotiator won't budge.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: professional
      nuance: 「だって」 highlights that even someone considered very rational or flexible would not accept the
        demand, underscoring its extreme unreasonableness. 「～ない だろう」 expresses a strong conjecture or certainty.
      etymology: By attaching to 「彼」 (he), 「だって」 singles out an individual, asserting that even this person,
        who might be presumed immune to worry, would find the demand unacceptable. It emphasizes the outlier
        status of the demand.
    - english: Even if you try your hardest, sometimes results just don't come.
      japanese:
        - どんな に 頑張っ た {だ って}、結果 が 出 ない こと も ある。
        - どんな に 頑張っ た {だ って}、結果 が 出 ない こと も あり ます。
        - どんな に 頑張っ た {だ って}、成果 が 出 ない こと も ある。
      english_literally: No matter how much tried, even if, results don't come, it happens.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - どんな に 頑張っ {て も}、結果 が 出 ない こと も ある。
          english: Even if you try your hardest, sometimes results just don't come.
          hint: 「～ても」 is the standard way to say "even if." 「～だって」 is a more casual, colloquial alternative
            to 「～ても」, often used in spoken Japanese to convey a slightly more emphatic or resigned tone.
            We're looking for a casual expression.
      scene: An older, experienced colleague consoling a younger, discouraged one after a project failure.
      register: casual
      setting: supportive
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: 「～だって」 in this context serves as a casual and understanding way to express 'even if/though,'
        making the advice sound more personal and empathetic from an older, experienced colleague. The repeated
        「こと も ある」 subtly reinforces the idea that this is a common, unavoidable part of life. The casual
        nature of 「どんな に 頑張っ た だ って」 makes it suitable for comforting a peer.
      etymology: This is a colloquial contraction of 「～ても」 (even if), particularly used in casual speech.
        The emphasis on the past action 「頑張った」 (tried one's hardest) sets up a concession, implying that
        even with that effort, the outcome may not be favorable.
    - english: Even if it was cold, they're kids who love playing outside.
      japanese:
        - 寒かっ た {だ って}、外 で 遊ぶ の が 好き な 子供 たち だ。
        - 寒かっ た {だ って}、外 で 遊ぶ の が 好き な 子供 たち です。
        - 寒かっ た {だ って}、彼 ら は 外 で 遊ぶ の が 好き な 子供 たち だ。
      english_literally: Was cold, even if, outside playing is liked by children.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 寒く {て も}、外 で 遊ぶ の が 好き な 子供 たち だ。
          english: Even if it was cold, they're kids who love playing outside.
          hint: 「～ても」 is the standard way to say "even if" with an i-adjective. 「～だって」 is a casual, conversational
            substitute for 「～ても」, implying a concession despite the situation. We're looking for a casual
            way to express this.
      scene: A parent describing their children's resilience to a grandparent.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      nuance: Similar to the previous example, 「～だって」 here is a casual alternative to 「～ても」 (even if). It
        conveys a slightly more informal and perhaps slightly resigned tone, emphasizing the children's
        unwavering desire to play outdoors despite the challenging weather. The plain form 「寒かった」 is appropriate
        for casual speech.
      etymology: This casual usage of 「だって」 after the plain past form of an i-adjective (寒かった) is another
        instance of its contracted form for 'even if,' providing a colloquial alternative to 「～ても」. It highlights
        a concession despite the circumstance.
    - english: Even rich people have their worries.
      japanese:
        - お 金持ち {だ って}、悩み が ない わけ じゃ ない。
        - お 金持ち {だ って}、悩み が ない わけ じゃ あり ませ ん。
        - お 金持ち {だ って}、悩み が ない わけ で は ない。
      english_literally: Rich people, even if, worries don't exist, it's not the case.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - お 金持ち {で も}、悩み が ない わけ じゃ ない。
          english: Even rich people don't mean they don't have worries.
          hint: Both mean "even rich people," but 「だって」 adds a slightly stronger emphasis, perhaps to correct
            a common misconception more emphatically than 「でも」. We're emphasizing the unexpectedness that
            *even* rich people have worries.
      scene: Two friends discussing common misconceptions about wealth and happiness.
      register: casual
      setting: reflective
      nuance: The phrase 「～わけじゃない」 (it's not that...) is a common way to express that something is not entirely
        true or to correct a misconception. Coupled with 「だって」, it strongly asserts that even a seemingly
        privileged group faces common struggles, as if correcting a common assumption.
      etymology: The combination of 「だって」 with a noun like 「お金持ち」 emphasizes that even this category of
        people, often assumed to be problem-free, is not an exception, reinforcing the universal nature
        of worries.
    - english: You won't know anything until you try it.
      japanese:
        - 何 {だ って} やっ て み なきゃ わから ない こと だ。
        - 何 {だ って} やっ て み なきゃ わから ない こと です。
        - 何 {だ って} やっ て み ない と 分から ない こと だ。
        - 何 {だ って} 試さ ない と 分から ない もの だ。
      english_literally: No matter what, if you don't try, you won't know it.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 何 {で も} やっ て み なきゃ わから ない こと だ。
          english: You won't know anything until you try it.
          hint: While 「何でも」 means "anything" or "whatever," 「何だって」 can convey a slightly more comprehensive
            or assertive nuance, implying that absolutely *anything* must be tried. We're looking for that
            stronger, all-encompassing emphasis.
      scene: A coach motivating their team before a challenging match.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: inspirational
      nuance: The phrase 「何 だって」 (no matter what/anything) paired with 「やって み なきゃ わから ない」 (won't know unless
        you try) creates a strong, encouraging message. It implies that every possibility should be explored.
        The slightly formal 「こと だ」 makes the statement sound like an established truth or principle.
      etymology: This usage of 「だって」 with the question word 「何」 to mean 'anything' or 'no matter what' signifies
        an exhaustive inclusion, implying that all possibilities within a category are covered.
    - english: Even he must be feeling uneasy during such a difficult period.
      japanese:
        - こんな 大変 な 時期 に、彼 {だ って} 不安 に 感じ て いる だろう。
        - こんな 大変 な 時期 に、彼 {だ って} 不安 に 感じ て いる でしょう。
        - こんな 大変 な 時期 に、彼 {だ って} 不安 を 感じ て いる はず だ。

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - こんな 大変 な 時期 に、彼 {で も} 不安 に 感じ て いる だろう。
          english: Even he must be feeling uneasy during such a difficult period.
          hint: Similar to Example 5, 「彼だって」 implies a stronger or more surprising emphasis on *even him*
            feeling uneasy, highlighting the severity of the situation. We're emphasizing the unexpectedness
            that *even he* is affected.
      scene: Friends discussing a stoic individual who usually hides emotions but is facing a crisis.
      register: casual
      setting: serious
      nuance: 「だって」 highlights that even someone typically resilient or composed is affected by the severe
        circumstances, underscoring the widespread impact of the "difficult period." 「～て いる だろう」 indicates
        a conjecture about an ongoing state, fitting the idea of someone's internal feelings.
      etymology: Similar to its use with '山田さん', attaching 「だって」 to 「彼」 (he) emphasizes an unexpected inclusion,
        asserting that even this person, who might be presumed immune to worry, would find the demand unacceptable,
        highlighting the severity of the situation.
    - english: I just made the same mistake yesterday, too.
      japanese:
        - 昨日 {だ って}、同じ ミス を し た ばかり だ。
        - 昨日 {だ って}、同じ ミス を し た ばかり です。
        - 昨日 {だ って}、同じ ミス を し た ばかり な ん だ。

      english_literally: Yesterday, even, just made the same mistake.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 昨日 {も}、同じ ミス を し た ばかり だ。
          english: I also just made the same mistake yesterday.
          hint: 「も」 indicates "also" or "too." 「だって」 adds a stronger emphasis, implying "even as recently
            as yesterday" or a surprising recurrence, making the self-deprecating tone more pronounced.
            We're emphasizing that *even yesterday* it happened.
      scene: Someone admitting to a recurring error, perhaps in a self-deprecating way.
      register: casual
      setting: apologetic
      nuance: The combination of 「だって」 and 「～した ばかり」 (just did) emphasizes the recency and repetition of
        the mistake, conveying a sense of exasperation with oneself. 「だって」 here adds a tone of 'even then/even
        as recently as yesterday', implying that the mistake happened surprisingly quickly again.
      etymology: This usage of 「だって」 attached to a temporal word like 「昨日」 (yesterday) serves to emphasize
        the timing, implying 'even as recently as yesterday' or 'yesterday as well,' highlighting a surprising
        or notable recurrence.
  post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「だって」 offers a nuanced way to express inclusion,
    emphasis, or concession. Its casual nature makes it highly prevalent in everyday conversation. Pay attention
    to how it contrasts with 「も」 or 「でも」, often carrying a stronger, more assertive tone. While 「も」 simply
    adds information and 「でも」 can imply 'even' or 'any' without strong emphasis, 「だって」 often highlights
    an unexpected or insistent inclusion, especially when also functioning as a casual substitute for 「～ても」.

  details:
    part-of-speech: conjunction
    register: casual
    usage-context: general
  etymology: だって is a colloquial contraction of だとて (da to te), where だ is the plain form of the copula
    です (desu), and とて (tote) is an adverbial particle meaning "even if" or "even though." Over time, だとて
    simplified to だって, retaining its function of introducing a reason or explanation.
  writeup: |-
    だって is a versatile expression primarily used in casual conversation. It combines だ (the copula) with the adverbial particle とて. Its main function is to introduce a reason or explanation, often with a hint of displeasure or defensiveness. Think of it as a more emphatic "because." When used at the beginning of a sentence, it prefaces an explanation or counterpoint, similar to でも (demo).

    When used as んだって (n datte) at the end of a sentence, it conveys hearsay, like "I heard that..." This usage is considered more casual and can sound a bit childish, especially when followed by もん (mon) or もの (mono). It's essential to be mindful of the context to accurately interpret its meaning.

      meaning: I heard that; it means that

    - term: ときいた (I heard that)
      meaning: I heard that
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「ときいた」 is a more direct and formal way of saying "I heard that," without the added nuance
        of explanation or excuse found in 「だって」.

    - term: それでも (even so)
      meaning: But still; even so

      meaning: Because; the reason is

      grammar_point: なぜなら〜から (emphasized reason)
    - term: (っ)たって (even if)
      meaning: Even if; even though
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: 「たって」 focuses on hypothetical situations or concessions and is a contraction of 「ても」, whereas
        「だって」 is a conjunction or particle for reasons and emphasis, and is a contraction of 「だとて」. They
        are homophones but distinct in meaning and origin.
      grammar_point: (っ)たって (even if)
    - term: から (reason cause)
      meaning: Because; since
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「から」 states a neutral reason, 「だって」 introduces a reason with a more personal, emotional,

      grammar_point: から (reason cause)
    - term: もの・もん (because・since)
      meaning: Because; since
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「もん」 is very similar to 「だって」 for casual reasons, often used by women and children, but 「だって」
        can carry a stronger sense of argument or direct response to an implied question/accusation, especially
        when used to start a sentence.
      grammar_point: もの・もん (because・since)
    - term: そうだ (hear that)
      meaning: I heard that; It is said that
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「そうだ」 (hearsay) is a standard way to convey reported information. 「だって」 (hearsay) is more

    - term: らしい (I hear, it seems)
      meaning: I hear, it seems
      kind: similar expression

      grammar_point: らしい (I hear, it seems)
    - term: でも (even・any・no matter)
      meaning: Even; or something; any (with question words); no matter (who/what/where/when)
      kind: similar expression

        sometimes implying 'even this surprising thing' or 'even someone like that'.
      grammar_point: でも (even・any・no matter)
    - term: も (addition or emphasis particle)
      meaning: Also, too, as well, even, either, neither
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「も」 means 'also' or 'even' in a general sense. 「だって」 adds a stronger, more emphatic 'even'
        or 'also', often in contexts where the inclusion is notable or surprising.
      grammar_point: も (addition or emphasis particle)
  post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, consider the level of formality and the specific nuance
    you want to convey. If you're simply relaying information without adding personal explanation or strong
    emphasis, more neutral options like 「から」 or 「そうだ」 might be more appropriate. For more formal hearsay,
    use 「ということだ」 or 「ときいた」. If you want to concede a point despite something else, use 「それでも」. 「だって」 is
    best used when you want to give a casual, often emotional or defensive, reason, or to emphatically include
    something surprising, or for informal hearsay among peers.

          english: Ahh, I don't want to go. It's because that guy's coming, isn't it?

      register: casual
      setting: humorous
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The opening 「ああ」 expresses a sigh or groan, indicating reluctance. The use of 「あいつ」 for 'that
        guy' is casual and slightly derogatory. This expression of a personal, somewhat whiny reason is
        typical for 「だって」 in this context.

      speaker_age: younger

      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The phrase 「まずい ん だもん」 uses 「んだ」 for emphasis and 「もん」 to convey a personal, emotional reason,

        themselves.

      register: formal
      setting: serious
      nuance: The use of 「子供 だって」 emphasizes the universal impact of harsh words, suggesting that even someone

          hint: 「そうだ」 indicates hearsay, but 「んだって」 is a more casual way to relay information you've heard,
            especially among peers or for light gossip.
      scene: Colleagues informally sharing office gossip.
      register: casual
      setting: informative

      scene: A student relaying last-minute information to a classmate.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      nuance: The phrase 「なんだって」 is a very casual way to report something heard from another source, often

        or as a quick update.

          english: I heard the president approved the new project.
          hint: 「そうだ」 implies hearsay, but 「だってよ」 is used to casually and excitedly relay news or information
            that the speaker has just learned, with a slight emphasis.
      scene: Employees excitedly sharing news they overheard from management.
      register: casual
      setting: excited
      nuance: The combination of 「だって」 with the sentence-final particle 「よ」 adds a sense of informing the

          hint: While 「から」 states a neutral reason, 「だって」 combined with 「もん」 adds a softer, more personal,
            or slightly defensive nuance to the excuse, often used by female speakers.
      scene: A high school girl giving an excuse for not being able to read something.
      register: casual
      setting: apologetic
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: The use of 「もん」 (a casual variant of 「もの」) at the end of the sentence adds a feminine or childish
        nuance, making the excuse sound softer and more personal. The phrase 「苦手 なんだ」 emphasizes the speaker's
        personal difficulty.

          english: I'm going home early today. It's because I have plans.
          hint: 「から」 is a standard way to give a reason. However, 「だって」 combined with 「もの」 softens the reason
            and makes it sound more like a personal justification rather than a neutral statement.
      scene: A coworker informing their colleague they're leaving early.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: informative
      nuance: The sentence ends with 「もの」, which is a soft, explanatory particle, often used when giving
        a reason or excuse. This makes the statement sound more personal and less abrupt than a simple declarative
        sentence.
    - english: Even he makes mistakes sometimes.

          english: Even he makes mistakes sometimes.
          hint: While 「でも」 can mean 'even', 「だって」 emphasizes the surprising inclusion of 'him' (who is usually
            perfect) among those who make mistakes, adding a nuanced sense of unexpectedness.
      scene: Someone pointing out that even a usually perfect person has flaws.
      register: casual
      setting: serious
      nuance: 「彼 だって」 emphasizes that *even* a person typically considered flawless is subject to making
        mistakes, highlighting a universal truth. The 「よ」 at the end confirms this understanding to the
        listener.
    - english: The reason I was late is because I had to do my homework.

          english: The reason I was late is because I had to do my homework.
          hint: 「から」 simply states a reason. 「だって」, when used to introduce a reason, often carries a slight
            defensive or self-evident tone, making it more personal than a neutral explanation.
      scene: A student explaining their tardiness to a teacher.
      register: casual
      setting: apologetic
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The construction 「〜やらなきゃ いけなかった」 means 'had to do', expressing a strong obligation. The use
        of 「だって」 at the beginning of the reason clause here suggests a slight defensiveness or an explanation
        that the speaker feels is self-evident.
    - english: I'm kind to you because I like you.
      japanese:
        - 君 に 優しい の は、{だ って} 君 が 好き だ から さ。

            - 君 に 優しい の は、君 が 好き だ {から} さ。
          english: I'm kind to you because I like you.
          hint: While 「から」 provides the reason, 「だって」 introduces it with a more emotional or personal emphasis,
            which fits the flirty tone better than a simple factual statement.
      scene: A young man subtly flirting with someone he's attracted to.
      register: casual
      setting: flirty
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The sentence ends with 「さ」, a casual particle often used by male speakers to add emphasis
        or a sense of shared understanding. The use of 「君 が 好き だ から」 directly states the affectionate reason
        for his kindness.
    - english: This movie is definitely going to be interesting!

          english: This movie is definitely going to be interesting!
          hint: 「から」 states a reason. 「だって」 combined with 「んだもん」 adds a strong emotional conviction and
            personal belief to the reason, often used by female speakers for emphatic explanations.
      scene: A teenager enthusiastically trying to convince a friend to watch a movie.
      register: casual
      setting: excited
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The use of 「絶対」 (zettai) means 'definitely', expressing strong certainty. The phrase 「ん だもん」
        at the end, particularly with 「もん」, adds an emotional, perhaps slightly childish, conviction to
        the statement, often used by female speakers.

            - そんな こと 私 に は わから ない {から}。
          english: I wouldn't know anything like that.
          hint: 「から」 provides a neutral reason. 「だって」 introduces a reason or excuse with a slightly defensive
            or resigned tone, emphasizing a personal inability or lack of knowledge.
      scene: Someone confronted with an unexpected question, feeling a bit overwhelmed or unprepared.
      register: casual
      setting: apologetic
      nuance: Starting with 「だって」 here introduces a reason or an excuse in a slightly defensive or resigned
        tone. 「私 に は わからない」 highlights the speaker's personal inability to know or understand, often used
        when feeling unprepared or overwhelmed.
  post_example_writeup: 'When using だって, remember the nuance it conveys: a reason, often with a touch of
    defensiveness or childlike explanation. Consider the context and your relationship with the listener
    to ensure the message is conveyed appropriately.'
