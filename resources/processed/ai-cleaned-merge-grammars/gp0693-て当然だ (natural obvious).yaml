    "etymology": "「当然 (とうぜん)」 literally means \"of course\" or \"naturally.\" By attaching the て-form of a preceding word/phrase to 「当然だ」, it creates a construction where the action or state preceding 「て当然だ」 leads to a natural or logical consequence. The て-form here acts as a connecting particle indicating reason or cause, similar to its use in other grammatical patterns.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「て当然だ」 (or 「て当然です」 in polite form) is used to express that something is **natural, obvious, or a matter of course**. It conveys a strong sense of expectation or inevitability regarding an outcome given a certain preceding condition or reason. The speaker uses this expression when they believe the outcome is fully justified or to be expected under the circumstances.\n\nThis pattern attaches to the て-form of various word types:\n*   **Verbs**: For actions or states expressed by verbs (e.g., 疲れる → 疲れて当然だ 'it's natural to be tired').\n*   **い-Adjectives**: For states expressed by い-adjectives (e.g., 美味しい → 美味しくて当然だ 'it's natural for it to be delicious').\n*   **な-Adjectives**: For states expressed by な-adjectives, using the `な-adjective stem + で` (e.g., 綺麗だ → 綺麗で当然だ 'it's natural for it to be beautiful').\n*   **Nouns**: For states expressed by nouns, using `Noun + で` (e.g., 学生だ → 学生で当然だ 'it's natural to be a student').\n\nWhile the nuance is similar to '当たり前だ' (atarimae da), 「て当然だ」 often carries a stronger, more assertive tone, emphasizing the logical consequence or the undeniable nature of the situation. It is a direct and somewhat emphatic way of stating the obvious.",
