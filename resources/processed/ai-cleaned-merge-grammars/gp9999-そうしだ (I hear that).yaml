jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to convey information that one has heard from others, or that is derived from external
    reports, news, or observations, without necessarily confirming its absolute truth.
  function: To report information, news, or rumors.
  nuance: Implies that the speaker is not the original source of the information and presents it as unconfirmed
    or secondhand. It suggests that the speaker is merely relaying what they've heard or read.
etymology: The grammatical element 「そう」 (sō) meaning 'it seems' or 'I hear' originates from the classical
  auxiliary verb 然り (sari), which translates to 'to be so' or 'to be thus'. Over centuries, this verb
  underwent a process of grammaticalization, losing its independent verbal status and evolving into a
  particle used to convey appearance or reported speech. The addition of the copula 「だ」 (da) provides
  an assertive or declarative nuance. The specific form 「そうしだ」, however, is not standard for this meaning
  in modern Japanese. It appears to be a unique or possibly mistaken combination; the standard hearsay
  form is 「そうだ」. The origin of the 'し' in this context is unclear and does not align with the historical
  development of the hearsay 'そうだ'.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「そうだ」 (hearsay) is used to relay information that you have heard from someone else, or that you have read, or that you have gathered from an external source such as news or a public announcement. It expresses that the information is reported, and you are not necessarily asserting it as a definitive fact.

  ### Formation and Usage:
  「そうだ」 attaches directly to the plain form of verbs and い-adjectives. For な-adjectives and nouns, the plain form 「だ」 is dropped before 「そうだ」 for な-adjectives, and typically kept for nouns (Noun + だそうだ).

  *   **Verbs:**
      *   行く (iku) -> 行くそうだ (iku sou da) - I hear (they) are going.
      *   食べない (tabenai) -> 食べないそうだ (tabenai sou da) - I hear (they) are not eating.
      *   行った (itta) -> 行ったそうだ (itta sou da) - I hear (they) went.
      *   行かなかった (ikanakatta) -> 行かなかったそうだ (ikanakatta sou da) - I hear (they didn't go.

  *   **い-Adjectives:**
      *   高い (takai) -> 高いそうだ (takai sou da) - I hear it's expensive.
      *   高くない (takakunai) -> 高くないそうだ (takakunai sou da) - I hear it's not expensive.
      *   高かった (takakatta) -> 高かったそうだ (takakatta sou da) - I hear it was expensive.
      *   高くなかった (takakunakatta) -> 高くなかったそうだ (takakunakatta sou da) - I hear it wasn't expensive.

  *   **な-Adjectives:**
      *   元気だ (genki da) -> 元気そうだ (genki sou da) - I hear (they) are fine. (Note: 「だ」 is usually dropped).
      *   元気ではない (genki dewa nai) -> 元気ではないそうだ (genki dewa nai sou da) - I hear (they) are not fine.

  *   **Nouns:**
      *   学生だ (gakusei da) -> 学生だそうだ (gakusei da sou da) - I hear (he/she) is a student. (Note: 「だ」 is usually kept).

  When using 「そうだ」 for hearsay, the nuance is that you are simply relaying information. You are not confirming it or expressing your own opinion about its likelihood.

  It is crucial to understand that the given grammar point name "そうしだ" is not a standard or commonly recognized form for conveying hearsay in modern Japanese. The correct and widely used form is 「そうだ」. If you encounter "そうしだ" in any context, it is likely a miswriting, a highly localized dialectal variation, or possibly a phonetic interpretation of something else. For reliable communication, always use 「そうだ」 when you mean "I hear that" or "it is said that."

  - term: '[Verb-stem]・[い-Adjective-stem]・[な-Adjective]そうだ'
    meaning: it seems・looks like
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This 「そうだ」 conveys an observation or an appearance, meaning 'it looks like' or 'it seems'.
      It attaches to the stem form of verbs and adjectives, and to the plain form of な-adjectives (dropping
      the だ). Unlike the hearsay 「そうだ」, it expresses the speaker's direct impression or inference based
      on what they see or feel, not reported information.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]・[い-Adjective-stem]・[な-Adjective]そうだ (it seems・looks like)'
  - term: '[Sentence]らしい'
    meaning: it seems, based on evidence・I hear
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「らしい」 also conveys hearsay or information learned from others, it often carries a stronger
      nuance of probability based on some kind of evidence or logical deduction, rather than simply relaying
      information. It implies a degree of subjective judgment by the speaker that the information is likely
      true. 「そうだ」 is more neutral, simply stating what was heard.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
  - term: '[Sentence]とのことだ'
    meaning: it is said that・I hear that・formal
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とのことだ」 is a more formal way to convey reported information, often used in business or official
      contexts. It explicitly states that the information comes from a third party and is more polite
      than 「そうだ」. 「そうだ」 can be used in both casual and polite forms depending on the sentence ending (e.g.,
      そうです).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Sentence]とのことだ (it is said that・I hear that・formal)
  - term: '[Sentence]って'
    meaning: quotation marker, casual
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「って」 is a very casual contraction of 「と言う」 or 「ということ」. It's used in informal speech to quote
      someone directly or to relay something heard, similar to 「そうだ」 but much more casual. It can also
      be used as a casual topic marker. While it conveys hearsay, it lacks the formal structure and can
      sometimes sound abrupt compared to 「そうだ」.

post_false_friends_writeup: "When distinguishing between the hearsay 「そうだ」 and the appearance 「そうだ」, remember\
  \ their formation rules: hearsay 「そうだ」 connects to the plain form of verbs and い-adjectives, while appearance\
  \ 「そうだ」 connects to the stem form. For な-adjectives, hearsay uses the stem (dropping だ), and appearance\
  \ also uses the stem. For nouns, hearsay typically uses 「だそうだ」, whereas appearance 「そうだ」 does not directly\
  \ attach to nouns in the same way (e.g., 忙しそう - looks busy, but 医者そうだ is not used). \n\n「らしい」 implies\
  \ a stronger basis for the reported information, making it seem more probable in the speaker's mind.\
  \ 「そうだ」 is merely a relay of information. \n\n「とのことだ」 is best used in formal situations for reporting\
  \ information, while 「って」 is the most casual way to convey something heard, suitable only for informal\
