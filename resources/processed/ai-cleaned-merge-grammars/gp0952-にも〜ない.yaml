    "etymology": "The pattern 「にも〜ない」 combines 「にも」, which adds emphasis, with a verb in both its volitional (intention) and potential negative forms. This pairing highlights the contrast between wanting to perform an action and being unable to do so. The repetition of the verb emphasizes the futility of the attempt.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「にも〜ない」 expresses the idea that despite wanting to do something, one is unable to. It emphasizes a situation where there's a strong desire to act, but external circumstances or limitations prevent it. It often conveys a sense of frustration or helplessness.\n\nThe core structure involves repeating the same verb in two forms:\n\n*   Volitional form (意向形): Expresses intention or will, like 「しよう」 (let's do).\n*   Negative potential form (不可能形): Indicates inability, like 「できない」 (cannot do).\n\nFor example, 「帰ろうにも帰れない」 (kaerou ni mo kaerenai) literally translates to \"Even if I try to go home, I cannot go home,\" conveying \"I want to go home, but I can't.\"\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nThis pattern often highlights **physical reasons** or **external constraints** that prevent the action. However, this grammar pattern can also be used to express mental limitations. In such cases, the speaker doesn't want to do something, but a social situation means it is difficult to refuse.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「にも〜ない」 which explicitly expresses 'even if one tries, one cannot,' 「に〜ない」 (used in constructions like `〜するに〜ない`) more generally implies an inability due to a constraint or lack of inherent capacity, often without the explicit 'trying' element. It does not repeat the verb in volitional and potential forms.",
            "grammar_point": "<suggest>: に〜ない (general inability)"
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference between 「にも〜ない」 and similar expressions lies in their nuance. While 「どんなに〜ても」 emphasizes the degree of effort without necessarily implying impossibility, 「にも〜ない」 highlights the inability to perform an action despite the desire to do so. Meanwhile, while 「に〜ない」 also means \"cannot\", it pairs with verbs in dictionary form and tends to refer to inability due to a constraint or lack of capacity. Keep in mind that 「にも〜ない」 uses the volitional form.",

    "post_example_writeup": "This grammar point is incredibly useful for expressing a sense of powerlessness or frustration in situations where one's intentions are thwarted by external realities. Pay close attention to the repetition of the verb, first in its volitional form and then its potential negative form, as this is the defining characteristic of this construction. It paints a vivid picture of a desire met with an insurmountable obstacle. While it can apply to physical inability, remember its strength in describing situations where social pressure or emotional states prevent an action, as seen in the example about the drinking party.",
