    "etymology": "The pattern 「にも〜ない」 combines 「にも」, which adds emphasis, with a verb in both its volitional (intention) and potential negative forms. This pairing highlights the contrast between wanting to perform an action and being unable to do so. The repetition of the verb emphasizes the futility of the attempt.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「にも〜ない」 expresses the idea that despite wanting to do something, one is unable to. It emphasizes a situation where there's a strong desire to act, but external circumstances or limitations prevent it.  It often conveys a sense of frustration or helplessness.\n\nThe core structure involves repeating the same verb in two forms:\n\n*   Volitional form (意向形): Expresses intention or will, like 「しよう」 (let's do).\n*   Negative potential form (不可能形): Indicates inability, like 「できない」 (cannot do).\n\nFor example, 「帰ろうにも帰れない」 (kaerou ni mo kaerenai) literally translates to \"Even if I try to go home, I cannot go home,\" conveying \"I want to go home, but I can't.\"\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   This pattern often highlights **physical reasons** or **external constraints** that prevent the action. However, example #4 「行きたくないけど、先輩に誘われたら断るに断れない」 is an example of when this grammar pattern can be used to express mental limitations. In this example, the speaker doesn't want to do something, but a social situation means it is difficult to refuse.",
