pronunciation:

  romaji: yasui
formation:
  Verb masu-stem + やすい: Indicates that an action is easy to perform or that something is susceptible to
    a certain state.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: casual
  function: Expresses ease of action or a tendency/predisposition.
  nuance: Can indicate inherent ease/simplicity or a tendency, often with a subtle negative connotation
    for the 'prone to' meaning.
  grammatical-role: Functions similarly to an い-adjective, modifying verbs to describe their ease of execution
    or a subject's susceptibility.
etymology: The suffix 「やすい」 originates from the classical Japanese adjective 「安し」(やすし), meaning 'easy,'
  'peaceful,' or 'cheap.' When affixed to a verb stem, it conveys the idea that the action is readily
  or simply carried out, or that the subject effortlessly falls into a particular state. This historical
  root highlights the core concept of 'ease' or 'lack of difficulty' that pervades all uses of the grammar
  point.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「V-stem + やすい」 is a versatile expression used to describe two primary concepts: the **ease** with which an action can be performed or something can be affected, and a **tendency or predisposition** for something to happen. It attaches to the masu-stem of verbs and conjugates exactly like an い-adjective.

  When indicating **ease of action**, 「やすい」 suggests that an activity is simple, convenient, or straightforward to do. For example, a 'comfortable chair' (座りやすい椅子) is easy to sit on. This usage is objective and descriptive.

  Conversely, when expressing a **tendency or predisposition**, 「やすい」 often implies that something is 'prone to' or 'likely to' occur. This nuance frequently carries a slightly negative or undesirable connotation, especially when describing faults, vulnerabilities, or habits. For instance, 'a person who gets angry easily' (怒りやすい人) is prone to anger. However, it is not always negative; it can also describe a natural characteristic, such as 'children easily catch colds' (子供は風邪をひきやすい).

  Understanding the context is key to discerning whether 「やすい」 indicates inherent ease or a natural, sometimes problematic, tendency.

  - term: にくい
    meaning: difficult to do
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While 「やすい」 indicates ease, 「にくい」 expresses difficulty. For example, 「読みにくい本」 means 'a book
      that is difficult to read', the direct opposite of 「読みやすい本」.
    grammar_point: にくい (difficult to do)
  - term: がち
    meaning: tend to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 「やすい」 (in its 'prone to' sense) and 「がち」 express a tendency. However, 「がち」 more strongly
      implies a frequent, habitual tendency, often undesirable, and can attach to nouns or verb stems.
      「やすい」 can refer to an inherent characteristic or susceptibility, not necessarily a repeated action.
      For example, 「病気がち」 means 'often sick' (habitual), whereas 「病気になりやすい」 means 'prone to getting sick'
      (susceptibility).
    grammar_point: がち (tend to)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'When distinguishing 「やすい」 from 「にくい」, simply remember they are antonyms:
  one means ''easy'' and the other ''difficult''. For 「やすい」 versus 「がち」, consider the nuance of frequency
  and inherent nature. While both can mean ''prone to'', 「がち」 often implies a recurring habit, whereas
  「やすい」 can describe a fundamental characteristic or susceptibility, regardless of how often it happens.'

  both inherent ease and natural tendencies. Its conjugation mirrors that of い-adjectives, making it a
  flexible and commonly used grammatical structure. Paying attention to context will help you discern
  whether 'easy to do' or 'prone to' is the intended meaning, especially when dealing with the more nuanced
  examples.
