meaning: Before even, not even, far from; implying a more fundamental problem or critical prerequisite.
pronunciation:
  katakana: イゼン
  romaji: izen
formation:
  Noun + 以前(に/の): Used after a noun to indicate that the problem or issue is more fundamental than the
    noun itself, implying a lack of basic fulfillment or a critical prerequisite.
  Verb (dictionary form) + 以前(に/の): Used after a verb in dictionary form to convey that a more basic action
    or condition must be met before the action of the verb can even be considered, often with a critical
    undertone.
  い-Adjective + 以前(に/の): Used after an い-adjective to suggest that a fundamental quality related to the
    adjective is missing or insufficient, making any further evaluation based on that adjective irrelevant.
  な-Adjective + 以前(に/の): Used after a な-adjective to imply that a core characteristic denoted by the adjective
    is not present or is flawed, making the point of the adjective moot, often critically.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Evaluative and critical contexts, often used to emphasize a foundational issue.
  nuance: Often carries a strong tone of criticism or emphasis, highlighting that a fundamental issue
    must be addressed before the explicitly stated point can even be considered. It implies a significant
    gap or failing in basic requirements.
  colocation: Often followed by に or の, connecting to a subsequent verb or noun. Frequently used with
    phrases that denote a fundamental problem or lack, such as 「問題だ」 (it's a problem) or 「話にならない」 (it's
    not worth talking about).
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially, modifying the preceding noun, verb, or adjective, and emphasizing
    a foundational issue.
  logical-flow: Establishes a hierarchy of importance, asserting that the point preceding 以前 is a more
    foundational or urgent matter than the one being discussed.
  temporal-flow: While it can refer to time, its primary function here is to indicate a logical precedence
    of importance, rather than a strict chronological order.
  spatial-flow: Does not typically involve spatial concepts; it primarily operates on abstract or logical
    relationships.
etymology: 以前 (izen) is composed of the kanji 以 (i), meaning "by means of; because of; in view of," and
  前 (zen), meaning "before; in front." Thus, 以前 literally means "before" or "prior to" something, but
  carries a stronger emphasis and often a critical nuance compared to just 前 (mae). It signifies that
  a prior, more fundamental issue must be addressed, drawing its critical edge from the implication that
  one should not even be at the point of considering the stated matter.
writeup: |-
  When used as a suffix, 以前 (izen) functions to indicate that a topic does not even fulfill the minimum requirements of what precedes it, and therefore a more fundamental issue needs to be addressed before considering the stated matter. This often translates to expressions like "before even (A)," "not even (A)," or "far from (A)" in English, and is commonly used to express criticism or to highlight something thoughtless or irresponsible.

  以前 attaches directly after nouns, verbs in their dictionary form, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives. It is typically followed by either the case-marking particle に or の. The choice between に and の depends on whether 以前 is linking to a subsequent verb (に) or noun (の). When に is used, 以前 に acts adverbially, often leading to a verb. When の is used, 以前 の acts adjectivally, modifying a subsequent noun.

  While 前 (mae) simply means "before" in a chronological sense, 以前 highlights a larger, more significant distance in terms of prerequisite or logical precedence. It acts as an emphatic version of 前, and it is this emphasis that often conveys the tone of criticism. It implies that a certain condition or action is so basic that it should have been dealt with "way before" or "long before" the current discussion or situation arose. This makes it particularly useful for pointing out foundational flaws or neglected fundamental steps.
false_friends:
  - term: 以前に
    meaning: before, previously
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike {以前} which often carries a critical or emphatic tone, 以前に is a more straightforward
      expression for indicating something that happened "before" something else in time or sequence, without
      implying a fundamental prerequisite.
    grammar_point: まえに (before・in front)
  - term: 以前から
    meaning: for a long time, since before
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike {以前}, 以前から indicates the duration of something, meaning "for a long time since before"
      a certain point in time, focusing on a continuous state or action from the past.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:以前から (for a long time, since before)
  - term: 前 (mae)
    meaning: before, in front of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 前 is a general term for 'before' or 'in front of' and does not inherently carry the critical
      or emphatic nuance of {以前} regarding a fundamental prerequisite. While {以前} is more formal and emphasizes
      a core issue, 前 can refer to any preceding event or position.
    grammar_point: まえに (before・in front)
  - term: どころか
    meaning: Far from; on the contrary; anything but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both {以前} and 「どころか」 express that something is not even at a certain level, {以前} implies
      that a more fundamental or prerequisite issue must be addressed first. 「どころか」, on the other hand,
      strongly emphasizes that the reality is the exact opposite of what might be expected or stated,
      often expressing a stronger degree of negativity or unexpectedness.
    grammar_point: どころか (far from)
  - term: に過ぎない
    meaning: No more than; just; merely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に過ぎない」 indicates that something is merely or only a certain thing, limiting its significance.
      In contrast, {以前} implies that something doesn't even meet a basic threshold or fundamental requirement,
      making a higher level of consideration irrelevant. While both denote a kind of insufficiency, {以前}
      points to a more fundamental lack, whereas 「に過ぎない」 describes a limitation in degree.
    grammar_point: にすぎない (no more than)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 以前 with similar expressions, remember that 以前 often carries
  a tone of criticism or emphasis, highlighting that something should be considered before even reaching
  a certain point due to a more fundamental issue. In contrast, 以前に simply means "before" or "previously,"
  referring to a chronological sequence. 以前から indicates a duration of time "since before" a certain point.
  前 (mae) is a general term for "before" without the strong critical implication of 以前. 「どころか」 emphasizes
  that the reality is the exact opposite of what's expected, and while similar in expressing a gap, 「に過ぎない」
  simply limits something's significance, rather than pointing to a foundational problem that makes further
  discussion moot.
examples:
  - english: Before even learning the job, you can't even manage basic greetings?
    japanese:
      - 仕事 を 覚える {以前} に、基本 的 な 挨拶 も でき ない の か。
      - 仕事 を 覚える {以前} に、基本 的 な 挨拶 も でき ませ ん か。
      - 仕事 を 覚える {以前} に、基本 的 な 挨拶 さえ おでき に なら ない の です か。
      - 仕事 を 覚える {以前} に、基本 的 な 挨拶 も でき ない ん じゃ ない か？
    english_literally: Job learning before, basic greetings even cannot do?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 仕事 を 覚える 前 に、基本 的 な 挨拶 も でき ない の か。
        english: Before learning the job, you can't even manage basic greetings?
        hint: Using 「前 に」 simply indicates a temporal order. The original sentence implies that basic
          greetings are a fundamental prerequisite that should be handled *before* even considering learning
          the job. We're looking for a critical emphasis on a foundational issue.
    scene: A senior employee, frustrated by a new hire's lack of fundamental workplace manners, delivers
      a stern reprimand.
    register: formal
    setting: commanding
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The older male speaker uses a strong, critical tone in 「できない のか」, which would be directed
      toward a younger female listener in a hierarchical work setting, making it clear that 'basic greetings'
      are a foundational requirement that must be mastered before anything else. This fits the emphatic
      and often critical nature of {以前}.
    etymology: The phrase 「できない のか」 is a direct and somewhat accusatory question, common in situations
      where a superior is expressing strong disappointment.
  - english: It's a matter before even ability; he simply lacks effort.
    japanese:
      - 能力 {以前} の 話 で、彼 は 努力 が 足り ない だけ だ。
      - 能力 {以前} の 話 で、彼 は 努力 が 足り ない だけ です。
      - 能力 {以前} の 話 で、彼 は 努力 が 足り ない だけ だ な。
    english_literally: Ability before story, he effort is lacking only.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 能力 の 問題 で は なく、彼 は 努力 が 足り ない だけ だ。
        english: It's not an ability problem; he simply lacks effort.
        hint: 「〜では なく」 means 'it's not X, but Y'. The original sentence uses 以前 to emphasize that the
          issue is so fundamental it comes *before* even considering ability. We're looking for a structure
          that highlights a critical prerequisite or a more fundamental issue.
    scene: A coach explains to an assistant why a talented player isn't performing well, pointing to a
      fundamental character flaw rather than skill.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    etymology: 「話 で」 is a common connective phrase meaning 'it's a matter of' or 'in terms of', often
      used to introduce the main point after setting the context.
  - english: This app, before even being convenient, crashes frequently.
    japanese:
      - この アプリ は 便利 {以前} に、頻繁 に クラッシュ する。
      - この アプリ は 便利 {以前} に、頻繁 に クラッシュ し ます。
      - この アプリ、便利 {以前} に 頻繁 に クラッシュ す ん だ よ。
    english_literally: This app convenience before, frequently crashes.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この アプリ は 便利 どころ か、頻繁 に クラッシュ する。
        english: Far from being convenient, this app frequently crashes.
        hint: 「〜どころか」 means 'far from X' or 'let alone X'. While it expresses a strong contrast, 以前 emphasizes
          that convenience is a secondary consideration because a more fundamental problem (crashing)
          exists. We're looking for a way to say that the fundamental issue makes the stated quality irrelevant.
    scene: A software developer complains to a colleague about a buggy application, highlighting its critical
      instability.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    etymology: 「クラッシュ する」 is a loanword (外来語, gairaigo) from English 'crash', commonly used for software
      or system failures.
  - english: Before even being kind, she doesn't try to understand other people's feelings.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 親切 {以前} に、他人 の 気持ち を 理解 しよう と し ない。
      - 彼女 は 親切 {以前} に、他人 の 気持ち を 理解 しよう と し ない の よ。
      - 彼女 は 親切 {以前} に、他人 の 気持ち を 理解 しよう と し ませ ん。
    english_literally: She kindness before, other people's feelings understand try not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 親切 な の で は なく、他人 の 気持ち を 理解 しよう と し ない。
        english: She isn't kind; rather, she doesn't try to understand other people's feelings.
        hint: 「〜なのではなく」 simply states what something is not. The original uses 以前 to convey that empathy
          is a prerequisite that is lacking, making kindness irrelevant. We're looking for a phrase that
          implies a more fundamental lack.
    scene: A person confides in a close friend about the frustrating behavior of a mutual acquaintance,
      describing a core lack of empathy.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: A younger female speaker might use this casual but direct language when sharing a personal
      frustration with a close female friend. The addition of 「のよ」 in one variation adds a soft, explanatory,
      yet emphatic feminine tone to the statement, highlighting a fundamental flaw in someone's character
      using {以前} to emphasize the severity of the issue.
    etymology: 「理解 しよう と しない」 means 'does not try to understand'. The particle 「と」 marks the goal or object
      of the verb 「する」 (to do), in this case, the effort of understanding.
  - english: Before even seeking results, you must first take action.
    japanese:
      - 結果 を 求める {以前} に、まず は 行動 し なけれ ば なら ない。
      - 結果 を 求める {以前} に、まず は 行動 し なけれ ば なり ませ ん。
      - 結果 を 求める {以前} に、まず は 行動 し なけれ ば なら ん の だ。
    english_literally: Results seek before, first action must take.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 結果 を 求める 前 に、まず は 行動 し なけれ ば なら ない。
        english: Before seeking results, you must first take action.
        hint: 「〜前 に」 indicates simple temporal sequence. The original sentence uses 以前 to stress that
          taking action is a fundamental, non-negotiable step that comes logically prior to even considering
          results. We're looking for a way to highlight a crucial prerequisite.
    scene: A seasoned mentor advises a hesitant student who is focused on outcomes without putting in
      the necessary groundwork.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    etymology: 「まずは」 is a combination of 「まず」 (firstly) and the particle 「は」 (topic marker), emphasizing
      that this action is the initial and most important step.
  - english: It's a problem before even trust; there's absolutely no credibility in his words.
    japanese:
      - 信頼 {以前} の 問題 で、彼 の 言葉 に は 一切 信用 が ない。
      - 信頼 {以前} の 問題 で、彼 の 言葉 に は 一切 信用 が あり ませ ん。
      - 信頼 {以前} の 問題 で、彼 の 言葉 に は 一切 信用 が ない ん です よ。
    english_literally: Trust before problem, his words in absolutely no credibility.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 信頼 の 問題 で は なく、彼 の 言葉 に は 一切 信用 が ない。
        english: It's not a trust problem; his words have absolutely no credibility.
        hint: 「〜では ない」 simply negates the first point. The original uses 以前 to convey that the lack of
          credibility is so fundamental that the concept of 'trust' is irrelevant. We're looking for a
          phrase that emphasizes a deeper, more foundational issue.
    scene: A business partner expresses deep distrust in a colleague, stating that the colleague's fundamental
      lack of credibility makes even the concept of trust irrelevant.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    etymology: 「一切 (issai)」 means 'absolutely' or 'not at all' when used with a negative, emphasizing
      a complete lack of something.
  - english: Before even talking about taste, the ingredients themselves aren't fresh.
    japanese:
      - 味 {以前} に、材料 が 新鮮 じゃ ない。
      - 味 {以前} に、材料 が 新鮮 で は ない です よ。
      - 味 {以前} に、材料 が 新鮮 じゃ ない ん だ よ。
    english_literally: Taste before, ingredients not fresh.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 材料 が 新鮮 で は ない の で、味 が ない。
        english: Because the ingredients aren't fresh, there's no taste.
        hint: This uses a simple causal relationship. The original emphasizes that freshness is a basic
          requirement *before* even considering taste. We're looking for a critical emphasis on a fundamental
          issue.
    scene: A chef inspects produce delivery at a restaurant, visibly disappointed and muttering to themselves.
    register: casual
    setting: creative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The speaker's casual tone, conveyed by 「じゃ ない」 and a direct complaint, is typical for a male
      chef expressing dissatisfaction with supplies. Using 「味 以前 に」 strongly indicates that the freshness
      of ingredients is a fundamental, prerequisite issue that makes discussions about taste entirely
      irrelevant, fitting the critical nature of a professional evaluating quality.
  - english: Before even discussing the plan, we haven't secured the budget.
    japanese:
      - 計画 を 議論 する {以前} に、予算 が 確保 でき て い ませ ん。
      - 計画 を 議論 する {以前} に、予算 が 確保 でき て い ない ん です。
      - 計画 を 議論 する {以前} に、予算 の 確保 が でき て おら ず。
    english_literally: Plan discuss before, budget secured not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 予算 が 確保 でき て い ない の で、計画 を 議論 でき ませ ん。
        english: Because the budget hasn't been secured, we cannot discuss the plan.
        hint: This uses a simple causal 'because'. The original uses 以前 to highlight that securing the
          budget is a *fundamental, non-negotiable prerequisite* before any discussion can even begin.
          We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes a crucial, foundational step that has been missed.
    scene: In a formal business meeting, a project manager points out a critical oversight during a presentation
      to a diverse group of stakeholders.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of the formal 「〜て い ませ ん」 by a female project manager addressing a group in a professional
      setting reinforces the serious, direct, and factual nature of the statement. 「議論 する 以前 に」 highlights
      that the budget is such a basic requirement that its absence renders any planning discussion premature
      and futile, conveying a strong sense of urgency and criticality.
  - english: Before even being fun, the rules are too complicated.
    japanese:
      - 楽しい {以前} に、ルール が 複雑 すぎる。
      - 楽しい {以前} に、ルール が 複雑 すぎ ます よ。
      - 楽しい {以前} に、ルール が 複雑 すぎ ん だ よ。
    english_literally: Fun before, rules too complicated.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ルール が 複雑 な の で、楽しく ない。
        english: Because the rules are complicated, it's not fun.
        hint: This explains the cause and effect directly. The original sentence uses 以前 to imply that
          the fun aspect can't even be considered because the complexity of the rules is a foundational
          barrier. We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes a basic, problematic condition that prevents
          the positive attribute from being realized.
    scene: Two friends are trying to play a new board game, but one is clearly frustrated with the instructions
      and expresses their exasperation.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The casual 「複雑 すぎる」 by a male speaker to another male friend conveys direct frustration, often
      with a slight humorous undertone due to the absurdity. The use of 「楽しい 以前 に」 emphasizes that the
      game's core design flaw (overly complex rules) is so fundamental that the concept of 'fun' cannot
      even enter the discussion. This is a common critical usage of 以前 in daily conversation.
  - english: Before even being healthy, the food itself is full of additives.
    japanese:
      - 健康 {以前} に、食べ物 自体 が 添加 物 だらけ だ。
      - 健康 {以前} に、食べ物 自体 が 添加 物 だらけ です よ。
      - 健康 {以前} に、食べ物 自体 が 添加 物 だらけ じゃ ない？
    english_literally: Healthy before, food itself additives full.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 食べ物 は 健康 に 良く ない です。添加 物 が 多い から。
        english: This food is not good for health because it has many additives.
        hint: This directly states the food is unhealthy and gives a reason. The original sentence uses
          以前 to highlight that the presence of additives is a fundamental issue that prevents the food
          from even being considered healthy. We're looking for a way to say that a basic condition makes
          the stated quality irrelevant.
    scene: A person explains their reluctance to eat a particular processed food product to a friend,
      emphasizing a critical concern about its ingredients.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The female speaker's direct statement, ending with 「だ」, indicates a clear opinion shared with
      a friend. 「健康 以前 に」 strongly conveys that the very concept of 'health' is irrelevant because the
      food fundamentally fails a more basic criterion (being free of excessive additives). This highlights
      a critical assessment of the product's quality, often shared among friends in a casual yet concerned
      manner.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 以前 is a powerful expression for highlighting
  a foundational issue or critical prerequisite. It goes beyond simple temporal ordering, emphasizing
  that the lack of something fundamental makes further discussion or evaluation moot. Mastering its nuance
  allows for more precise and impactful communication, especially when expressing criticism or identifying
  core problems.
