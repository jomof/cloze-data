formation:
  Verb (dictionary form) + だに: Expresses a feeling or thought triggered by merely performing the verb.
    This often implies a strong emotion, such as fear, disgust, or embarrassment, but can also convey
    envy or admiration.
  Noun/Suru-verb stem + だに + しない/Negative verb: Indicates a complete absence of an action or consideration
    on the part of the subject, suggesting that they don't even bother to do something. This applies to
    nouns or the stem of a 'suru' verb.
  Noun + に + だに + Negative verb: Used in specific idiomatic expressions, such as 夢にだに (yume ni dani -
    even in a dream).
jlpt: N1
etymology: The particle 「だに」 is believed to have originated from classical Japanese. While its exact etymology
  is debated, one theory suggests it evolved from a combination of 「だ」 (a form of the copula) and 「に」
  (a particle indicating location or direction). Over time, it developed its unique function of emphasizing
  an extreme condition or the minimal threshold for something to occur. Its usage is rooted in older literary
  forms and retains a formal, sometimes archaic, flavor.
writeup: |-
  The particle 「だに」 is a sophisticated grammatical element primarily found in formal writing and elevated speech. It serves two main functions: either to express that merely thinking about or performing an action is enough to trigger a profound emotional response, or to emphasize a complete absence of an action, even a very minor one.
  When combined with a verb in its dictionary form (e.g., 「思うだに」, 「考えるだに」), 「だに」 signifies that 'just' or 'merely' engaging in that action is sufficient to produce a strong feeling. This feeling is often negative, such as fear (恐ろしい), embarrassment (恥ずかしい), or disgust (嫌悪感), but it can also convey strong envy (羨ましい) or admiration. It highlights the intensity of the emotion relative to the simplicity of the trigger.
  Conversely, when 「だに」 is used in the negative form 「～だにしない」, it emphasizes that the subject 'doesn''t even' perform a certain action. This construction implies an absolute lack of action or consideration, often suggesting indifference, neglect, or an unexpected omission. For example, 「注意だにしない」 means 'doesn''t even pay attention' or 'doesn''t even warn'. This usage stresses the extreme degree of inaction. Because of its formal and somewhat archaic nature, 「だに」 is generally not used in casual conversation.

  - term: だけでも
    meaning: just by doing/thinking X; even if only X
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だけでも」 is more common and less formal than 「だに」. While both can express 'just by doing X',
      「だに」 often implies a more profound or overwhelming emotional response, or a more absolute lack of
      action in negative constructions. 「だけでも」 simply states a minimal condition or result without the
      strong emotional or literary overtone.
    grammar_point: だけで (just by)
  - term: さえ
    meaning: even; moreover
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「さえ」 also means 'even', but it typically emphasizes an extreme example or surprise, indicating
      that something applies *even to* a case that might be unexpected. 「だに」, on the other hand, focuses
      on the *minimal* action or thought sufficient to trigger a strong feeling, or the absolute absence
      of *any* action (in negative forms), often carrying a more literary or dramatic nuance.
    grammar_point: さえ (even・if only)
  - term: すら
    meaning: even; (not) even
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「すら」 is similar to 「さえ」 in meaning 'even', but it is generally more formal and often used
      to express a negative or critical nuance, implying an extreme or surprising lack. While both can
      be used in negative contexts (e.g., 「すらしない」 vs. 「だにしない」), 「だに」 often carries a more archaic or literary
      feel, particularly emphasizing a fundamental or shocking absence of action or consideration.
    grammar_point: すら (even)
  - term: 夢にも～ない
    meaning: not even in one's dreams
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a very common idiom meaning 'not even in one's dreams' or 'never imagined.' While
      similar in meaning to 「夢にだに思わない」, 「夢にも～ない」 is the more contemporary and conversational choice, lacking
      the archaic formality of 「だに」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:夢にも～ない (not even in one's dreams)
  - term: 微動もしない
    meaning: doesn't even twitch; doesn't budge
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This phrase is also used to indicate a complete lack of movement. 「微動だにしない」 is a more emphatic
      and literary expression, conveying a stronger sense of absolute stillness compared to the more common
      「微動もしない」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:微動も～ない (doesn't even twitch)
  - term: 全く～ない
    meaning: not at all; entirely not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「全く～ない」 is a general adverbial phrase for strong negation. 「だに~しない」 is more specific, emphasizing
      the absence of even the *minimal* amount or possibility, whereas 「全く～ない」 simply states a complete
      absence.
    grammar_point: 全く〜ない (not at all)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between 「だに」 and its close counterparts, consider the level
  of formality and the depth of emphasis. 「だに」 elevates the expression, adding a literary and dramatic
  quality to the idea of 'just' or 'not even'. If you want to convey a profound emotional reaction to
  a minimal stimulus, or an absolute, almost scandalous, lack of action or consideration, 「だに」 is often
  the most impactful choice. For more straightforward statements of 'even' or 'just by', 「さえ」, 「すら」, or
  「だけでも」 are more commonly used and less formal. While expressions like 「さえ~ない」 and 「すら~ない」 also convey
  the meaning of 'not even,' 「だに~しない」 carries a much more formal and often archaic nuance. It emphasizes
  the absolute minimum, suggesting that something is so unlikely or impossible that it wouldn't even occur
  at the most basic level. When choosing between these, consider the desired level of formality and the
  specific nuance of profound disbelief or complete absence you wish to convey.

        english: Even just by recalling an embarrassing mistake from high school, my face turns red.

          - 友人 が 南国 で 休暇 を 楽しん で いる と 考える だけ {で} も 羨ましい。
        english: Even just by thinking my friend is enjoying a tropical country, I get envious.
        hint: The intensity of the envy and the contrast with the speaker's own situation are better highlighted
          by a direct emphasis compared to the more neutral 「だけでも」.
    scene: A man is working hard in his office during a hot summer, looking at a photo of his friend on
      a beach, feeling a pang of jealousy.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「考えるだに」 emphasizes that the speaker doesn't need to experience the vacation directly;

          - 部 長 は 私 の 意見 に 一顧 {さえ} し なかっ た。
        english: The section chief didn't even give a single thought to my opinion.

        english: The section chief didn't even give a single thought to my opinion, implying a critical

        hint: The scene describes unwavering determination in the face of significant adversity, which

          than the simple negation of 「も」.

          - どんな 困難 に 直面 し て も、彼 の 決意 は 微動 {さえ} し なかっ た。
        english: No matter what difficulties he faced, his resolve didn't even waver an inch.

      and setbacks, he remains completely steadfast in his vision.

      silent, not even crying out.

      feels like an insurmountable task.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    nuance: While 「だに」 is formal, in this context 「出るだに億劫だ」 is used to hyperbolically express extreme

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は その 美しい 景色 を 一瞥 {すら} し なかっ た。
        english: He didn't even cast a glance at the beautiful scenery (with a critical nuance).

    scene: A person is watching a documentary about a humanitarian crisis, feeling deep empathy for the
      victims.
    register: formal
    setting: sympathetic
    nuance: 「想像するだに」 conveys a deep level of empathy, indicating that the mere act of imagining the suffering

      she remains expressionless, her face showing no hint of a smile.
    register: formal

    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「微笑だに浮かべなかった」 highlights the extreme impact of the shocking event. It means she
      was so affected that she couldn't even manage the slightest, most basic expression of a smile, indicating

          criticism, suggesting an almost unimaginable absence of basic thanks.

      member failed to acknowledge any of the help they received during the celebratory dinner.

  an emotion, thought, or action, emphasizing that not even the smallest degree of it was present or possible.
  This dual usage makes 「だに」 a powerful and nuanced expression in Japanese.
