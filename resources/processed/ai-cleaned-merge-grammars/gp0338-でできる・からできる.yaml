    "etymology": "「できる」 means \"to be made\" or \"to be possible.\" 「で」 indicates the means or method, while 「から」 indicates the origin or source.",
    "writeup": "「でできる」 and 「からできる」 both indicate that something is made from something else, but they have slightly different nuances. 「でできる」 (made *with*) is generally used when the material is obvious or directly used in the process. 「からできる」 (made *from*) is used when the material is less obvious or undergoes a transformation. However, in modern Japanese, 「でできる」 is often used more broadly, making the distinction less strict.\n\n*   「できる」 refers to something in general, while 「できている」 refers to something specific. For example, 「コンクリートでできる家」 (houses made of concrete) refers to houses in general, while 「この箸は竹でできている」 (these chopsticks are made from bamboo) refers to a specific pair of chopsticks.",
