    "writeup": "The grammar points 「でできる」 and 「からできる」 both indicate that an object is made from a certain material or originates from a specific source. While they convey a similar meaning in English—\"made of\" or \"made from\"—there is a subtle distinction in nuance.\n\n**「でできる」**\nThis construction is typically used when the material is easily identifiable or directly used in the creation process. For instance, if you can clearly see that a wooden table is indeed made of wood, 「木でできている」 would be appropriate. It emphasizes the **compositional material** that is visually evident or immediately recognizable.\n\n**「からできる」**\nThis form is generally employed when the material undergoes a significant transformation, making the original substance less obvious in the final product. It emphasizes the **origin or source material** from which something is derived. For example, miso is made from soybeans, but the soybeans themselves are no longer distinct in the final product; hence, 「大豆からできる」 is more suitable. It highlights the transformation from the raw ingredient to the finished item.\n\n**Modern Usage and Interchangeability**\nDespite these traditional distinctions, in contemporary Japanese, 「でできる」 is often used more broadly, sometimes even in situations where 「からできる」 might traditionally be preferred. As a result, the two forms are becoming increasingly interchangeable in everyday conversation, especially for many common items.\n\n**「できる」 vs. 「できている」**\nAnother nuance lies in the difference between 「できる」 and 「できている」. While both are used in this construction:\n*   **「できる」**: Refers to a general fact or a broad statement about what something is typically made of. It describes a general property or the potential for something to be made from a material.\n*   **「できている」**: Refers to a specific item and its current state of being made from a particular material. It describes the existing composition of a single object.",
