    "etymology": "The etymology of といえども can be traced back to classical Japanese. と is a particle indicating content or quotation. いえ is the hypothetical form (仮定形 kateikei) of the verb いう (to say). ども is a conjunction expressing concession or reservation, similar to けれども. Thus, といえども literally translates to 'even if one were to say,' but functions as 'even though' or 'although'.",
    "writeup": "といえども is a formal conjunction expressing \"even if\" or \"although\". It is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the hypothetical form いえ of the verb 言う (to say), and the conjunction ども, which functions similarly to けれども or ても. While a literal translation might be \"even if one were to say (A),\" it is generally understood as \"even if (A)\" or \"although (A).\"\n\nThis grammar point is considered an older, more emphatic way of saying といっても. Despite the nuance being slightly different, といえども can be thought of as a very old-fashioned way of saying といっても. Due to といえども being old-fashioned, it is often used for emphasis and will frequently be paired with expressions like いくら, いかに, どんなに (no matter how), etc.\n\nといえども can follow nouns, い-adjectives, or verbs in any of their standard plain forms. For な-adjectives, だ will precede といえども. This grammar point is typically found in formal writing and speech, lending a somewhat archaic or emphatic tone to the statement.\n\nThough very rarely used, sometimes いえども is seen as 雖も. In these cases, the kanji 雖, which means 'however', is simply paired with も. This creates a slight difference between 'however even (A)', and the more modern 'even if one were to say (A)'. Despite this, the meanings are used interchangeably in modern times.",

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "といえども is distinct due to its higher formality and stronger emphasis on concession compared to といっても and ても. While all convey \"even if\" or \"although,\" といえども often carries a tone of acknowledging a surprising or significant exception, or asserting a principle despite a challenging condition. といっても is more of a casual disclaimer or a simple factual concession. ても is a general conditional concession, widely applicable without the specific weight of といえども. Consider the context and the level of formality required when choosing between them.",
