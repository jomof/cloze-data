    "writeup": "`といえども` is a formal conjunction expressing \"even if\" or \"although\". It's a combination of the particle `と`, the hypothetical form `いえ` of the verb `言う` (to say), and the conjunction `ども`, similar to `けれども` or `ても`. While a literal translation might be \"even if one were to say (A),\" it's generally understood as \"even if (A)\" or \"although (A).\" It's considered an older, more emphatic way of saying `といっても`.\n\n  *   **Usage:** Follows nouns, い-adjectives, or verbs in their plain forms. な-adjectives are followed by `だ` before `といえども`.\n  *   **Emphasis:** Often used with words like `いくら` (how much), `いかに` (how), `どんなに` (no matter how) for added emphasis.\n  *   **Historical Note:** Rarely, `いえども` can appear as `雖も`, using the kanji `雖` (however).\n\n  This grammar point is typically found in formal writing and speech, lending a somewhat archaic or emphatic tone to the statement.",
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「といえども」 can be traced back to classical Japanese. 「と」 is a particle indicating content or quotation. 「いえ」 is the 仮定形 (kateikei, hypothetical form) of the verb 「いう」(to say). 「ども」 is a conjunction expressing concession or reservation, similar to 「けれども」. Thus, 「といえども」 literally translates to 'even if one were to say,' but functions as 'even though' or 'although'.",
