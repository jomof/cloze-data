    "etymology": "The grammar point 「といえども」 is derived from 「と」 (a particle), 「いえ」 (the hypothetical form of the verb 「言う」, to say), and 「ども」 (a conjunction similar to 「けれども」, but more formal and archaic). Literally, it means something like \"even if one were to say.\"",
    "writeup": "「といえども」 is a formal expression meaning \"even if\" or \"although.\" It's a combination of the particle 「と」, the hypothetical form of 「言う」 (「いえ」), and the conjunction 「ども」 (similar to 「けれども」). While its literal translation might be closer to \"even if one were to say (A),\" it is generally understood as simply \"even if (A)\" or \"although (A).\" It is considered an old-fashioned way of saying 「といっても」. Because of its antiquated nature, 「といえども」 often adds emphasis and is frequently used with words like 「いくら」, 「いかに」, and 「どんなに」.",
