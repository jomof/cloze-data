    "etymology": "つつ is derived from the verb 「包む」(tsutsumu), meaning \"to wrap\" or \"to envelop.\" The grammar point implies being enveloped or surrounded by the action or state described by the verb it attaches to, even while another action is taken or another state exists. も adds an \"even though\" nuance.",
    "writeup": "つつ(も) adds the nuance of \"even\" to the base meaning of つつ, which is \"while doing (A).\" It is often translated as \"even while doing (A), (B),\" or \"although doing (A), (B).\" (B) will almost always be something that is somehow contradictory to (A). Like つつ, つつも will appear after the ます-stem of a verb that is the original ongoing action.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Like つつ, つつも will usually include a non-physical action in (A), such as reading, listening, looking, or thinking. (B) may be either physical or non-physical.\n*   つつも is similar to ながらも. Despite the similarities, remember that つつ only appears with verbs, while ながら can be used after almost any type of word.\n*   つつも has a formal register.",
