    "etymology": "つつ is derived from the verb 「つむ」, meaning 'to continue' or 'to repeat'. Adding 「も」 emphasizes the sense of 'even' or 'despite', highlighting the contrast between the actions.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「{つつ(も)}」 is used to express that an action or state is occurring, or a fact is known, despite a contradiction or internal conflict. It conveys meanings such as \"even while ~ing,\" \"even though ~ing,\" \"despite ~ing,\" or \"although ~ing.\"\n\nAt its core, 「つつ」 indicates a continuous action or state, similar to 「ながら」. The addition of 「も」 emphasizes a sense of \"even\" or \"despite,\" highlighting a contrast. The second clause (B) will almost always present something that is contradictory to the first clause (A). This contradiction can be an internal conflict, an unexpected outcome, or an action taken despite knowledge.\n\nWhile 「{つつ(も)}」 attaches to the ます-stem of a verb, it is typically used for non-physical actions or ongoing mental states, such as thinking, knowing, reading, or watching. For physical actions, 「ながらも」 is generally more natural. For example, one might say 「知りつつも」 (even while knowing) but less commonly 「走りつつも」 (even while running), preferring 「走りながらも」 instead.\n\n「{つつ(も)}」 is considered more formal than 「ながらも」 and is often encountered in written Japanese or more formal speech.",
