        "function": "Connects two clauses, where the second clause expresses a result or action contradictory to what one might expect from the first clause.",

    },
    "etymology": "「つつ」 is derived from the verb 「つむ」, meaning 'to continue' or 'to repeat'. Adding 「も」 emphasizes the sense of 'even' or 'despite', highlighting the contrast between the actions. This form implies a continuous or ongoing state or action in the first clause that stands in contradiction to the second clause.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「{つつ(も)}」 is used to express that an action or state is occurring, or a fact is known, despite a contradiction or internal conflict. It conveys meanings such as \"even while ~ing,\" \"even though ~ing,\" \"despite ~ing,\" or \"although ~ing.\"\n\nAt its core, 「つつ」 indicates a continuous action or state, similar to 「ながら」. The addition of 「も」 emphasizes a sense of \"even\" or \"despite,\" highlighting a contrast. The second clause (B) will almost always present something that is contradictory to the first clause (A). This contradiction can be an internal conflict, an unexpected outcome, or an action taken despite knowledge.\n\n「{つつ(も)}」 attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. It is typically used for non-physical actions or ongoing mental states, such as thinking, knowing, reading, or watching. For physical actions, 「ながらも」 is generally more natural. For example, one might say 「知りつつも」 (even while knowing) but less commonly 「走りつつも」 (even while running), preferring 「走りながらも」 instead.\n\n「{つつ(も)}」 is considered more formal than 「ながらも」 and is often encountered in written Japanese or more formal speech. It conveys a deeper sense of internal conflict or a more deliberate action taken despite contrary feelings or knowledge.",

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While expressions like 「ものの」, 「くせに」, and 「ながらも」 can convey similar ideas of contrast, their nuances differ significantly. 「ものの」 is a more general conjunction for contradiction. 「くせに」 carries a critical or accusatory tone, implying that the action or state is improper given the circumstances. 「ながらも」 is perhaps the closest in meaning to 「{つつ(も)}」, but 「{つつ(も)}」 tends to emphasize an internal, often psychological, contradiction or a more formal, literary context, especially with non-physical actions.",
