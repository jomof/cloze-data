    "writeup": "ので is a conjunctive particle used to connect two clauses, indicating a reason or cause. It is akin to から (kara), but ので typically conveys a more objective nuance, focusing on facts rather than subjective feelings. When used with nouns and な-adjectives, な must precede ので.\n\n**Key Differences from から:**\n*   ので emphasizes the overall situation and its consequences, presenting an objective reason.\n*   から tends to be more subjective and can sound less definitive, and is often used when giving a more direct command or request.\n\n**Usage Notes:**\n*   ので can sometimes be shortened to んで in more casual speech.\n*   Unlike many other connecting grammar points, ので can be used with the ます form of verbs, which is a distinctive feature for a conjunctive particle. This usage often appears in formal or polite contexts.",
