    "etymology": "The verb 「する」'suru' originates from the Old Japanese verb 「す」'su', meaning 'to do'. Over time, the auxiliary verb 「る」'ru' was added to create 「する」'suru', which became the standard form used in modern Japanese.",
    "writeup": "「する」 is a fundamental and highly versatile irregular verb in Japanese, primarily meaning \"to do,\" \"to make,\" or \"to perform an action.\" It is unique because it does not follow the standard conjugation patterns of Godan or Ichidan verbs. This irregular behavior stems from its historical evolution from the Old Japanese verb 「す」.\n\nOne of the most common applications of 「する」 is to convert nouns into verbs, particularly with nouns referring to actions, sports, or borrowed foreign words. For example, 「勉強」 (benkyou, study) becomes 「勉強する」 (benkyou suru, to study), and 「サッカー」 (sakkaa, soccer) becomes 「サッカーする」 (sakkaa suru, to play soccer).\n\nWhen used with nouns, 「する」 often takes the particle 「を」 (o) to mark the direct object of the action (e.g., 「宿題を する」, to do homework). It can also be used with 「に」 (ni) to express a decision or choice (e.g., 「これに する」, to decide on this).\n\nThis verb is indispensable for basic communication and is one of the first irregular verbs learners must master. Its conjugations, while irregular, are consistent and crucial for forming various tenses and moods. Although typically written in hiragana, the kanji 「為る」 (suru) exists but is rarely used in modern common texts.",
