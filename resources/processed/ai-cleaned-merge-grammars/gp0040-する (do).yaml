    "writeup": "「する」 is a fundamental verb in Japanese with multiple meanings, primarily \"to do\" and \"to make.\" It is also used to turn nouns into verbs, especially with loanwords (e.g., \"game を する\" means \"to play a game\").\n\n**Key uses:**\n\n*   **To do:** General actions or activities.\n*   **To make:** Creating or changing something.\n*   **To play:** Used with games or sports.\n*   **Noun + する:** Converts nouns into verbs, often for foreign words.\n\nThis verb is essential for basic communication and is one of the first verbs learners encounter.",
