details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Commonly used in daily conversation to suggest a timely action or to describe a slow,
    progressive change. Can be used for polite suggestions.
  function: To indicate a gradual process or an impending, timely action/state.
  nuance: Implies a gentle, natural progression or a polite suggestion. It has a softer, less abrupt feel
    than simply saying 'now' or 'soon'.
  grammatical-role: Modifies verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses, indicating temporal or mannerial aspects.
etymology: The reduplication of 「そろ」 (soro) suggests a gentle, slow, and continuous movement or action.
  The root sound 「そろ」 itself conveys quietness, softness, or gradualness, similar to sounds like 「そよそよ」
  (gentle breeze) or 「そろり」 (slowly and quietly). Its meaning evolved to encompass both gradual progression
  and the idea of 'it's about time' due to this inherent sense of slow, deliberate approach towards a
  point or state.
writeup: |-
  The adverb 「そろそろ」 is a versatile expression in Japanese, primarily conveying two main ideas: **gradualness** and **timeliness**. It describes an action or state that is progressing slowly and gently, or indicates that the time is approaching for something to occur.

  When 「そろそろ」 is used to describe gradualness, it often implies a soft, unhurried progression. For instance, 「そろそろ桜が咲き始める」 (The cherry blossoms are gradually starting to bloom) suggests a gentle unfolding over time, not an abrupt event.

  More commonly, 「そろそろ」 is used to mean "it's about time" or "soon." This usage carries a nuance of gentle suggestion or a recognition that the natural progression of time calls for a certain action or state. For example, when you say 「そろそろ帰りましょう」 (It's about time we went home), it's a polite and natural way to suggest departure, rather than a direct command. It acknowledges that the appropriate time for an action is drawing near.

  It is widely used in casual conversation and polite speech alike. It does not carry strong gender-specific or age-specific connotations and is generally appropriate in most everyday contexts.
false_friends:
  - term: だんだん (gradually)
    meaning: gradually; step by step; increasingly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both convey gradual change, 「だんだん」 focuses purely on the *gradual increase or decrease*
      in degree or state, emphasizing the step-by-step nature of the change. 「そろそろ」, however, often implies
      a *starting point* of that gradual change, or that it's *about time* for the change to begin, carrying
      a temporal aspect that 「だんだん」 lacks.
    grammar_point: だんだん (gradually)
  - term: もう (already・anymore)
    meaning: already; soon; another; more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「もう」 can mean 'soon' or 'already', but its usage for 'soon' is more immediate and sometimes
      abrupt, indicating that something will happen *very soon* or *has just happened*. 「そろそろ」 retains
      its gentle, gradual nuance, suggesting 'it's about time' rather than an urgent or immediate onset.
    grammar_point: もう (already・anymore)
  - term: 間もなく (shortly・soon)
    meaning: shortly; soon; before long
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「間もなく」 indicates that an event is imminent and will happen very soon. It emphasizes proximity
      in time. 「そろそろ」, while also meaning 'soon,' implies a more natural or gentle lead-up to an event,
      often carrying the connotation of 'it's about time,' rather than merely 'any moment now.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:間もなく (shortly・soon)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「そろそろ」 from similar adverbs, remember that its core lies
  in its dual nature of 'gradualness' and 'timeliness.' While 「だんだん」 strictly describes a step-by-step
  change, 「そろそろ」 suggests that such a change is either beginning or is due to begin. Unlike the immediate
  'soon' of 「もう」 or 「間もなく」, 「そろそろ」 provides a softer, more reflective sense of time's natural progression.

          conveyed by そろそろ.
