meaning: That (over there)
pronunciation:
  katakana: アノ
  romaji: ano
formation:
  あの + Noun: Indicates a specific noun that is 'over there,' away from both the speaker and listener.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: adjective
  usage-context: To refer to something distant from both the speaker and the listener, often physically,
    but sometimes metaphorically (e.g., in memory or general knowledge).
  grammatical-role: Functions as a determiner, always preceding a noun it modifies.
  spatial-flow: Indicates distance, placing the modified noun out of immediate reach or clear proximity
    to both participants in a conversation, and often out of their shared immediate space or attention
    focus as well, implying something commonly known or recalled by both speakers from a shared past or
    distant context.
etymology: 「あの」 originates from the demonstrative series 「こ・そ・あ・ど」. 「あ」 indicates something distant from
  both the speaker and the listener. It is related to 「あれ」 and 「あそこ」, which also denote things or places
  'over there.' Its usage as an interjection likely stems from its original sense of 'pointing away' or
  'referring to something distant,' which evolved into a linguistic pointer to gain attention or bridge
  thoughts.
writeup: |-
  「あの」 is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞・rentaishi) in Japanese. These words do not conjugate, always appearing in the same form. Although functionally similar to English demonstrative adjectives like "that," they belong to a distinct grammatical category in Japanese. 「あの」 comes from the 「こそあど」 family of words (demonstratives), and is used to identify a thing that is away from both the listener and the speaker. It's usually translated as "that" (thing over there). As the name 'pre-noun adjectival' suggests, these words always appear before a noun, modifying it. They function similarly to adjectives, directly preceding the noun they describe.

  Beyond its role as a pre-noun adjectival, 「あの」 also serves as a common interjection. In this capacity, it is used to gain someone's attention, to express hesitation, or to lead into a statement, much like "um," "uh," or "excuse me" in English. This dual function highlights the versatility of short Japanese words and how context dictates meaning.

post_false_friends_writeup: The Japanese demonstratives form a system known as 'kosoado' (これ, それ, あれ,
  どれ; この, その, あの, どの; ここ, そこ, あそこ, どこ; etc.). It is essential to distinguish 「あの」, which modifies a noun
  far from both speaker and listener, from other demonstratives like 「この」 (near speaker), 「その」 (near listener),
  or their pronoun counterparts 「あれ」 (far from both). Furthermore, be mindful that 「あの」 can also function
  as an interjection, signaling hesitation or to draw attention, a distinct usage from its role as a noun
  modifier. Mastering the spatial relationships and contextual cues is key to their correct usage.

      emphasis or informs the listener of something the speaker believes the listener should know or appreciate.
      「あの 山、美しい ね！」 is a more direct and exclamatory casual statement, while 「わぁ、あの 山、ほんと 美しい」 uses the
      interjection 「わぁ」 and the intensifier 「ほんと」 for an even stronger, more emotional, casual expression.

      use 「僕」 (boku) instead of 「私」 (watashi) for 'I' in a casual context, as shown in the third Japanese
      option. 「あの 人、私 の 兄 な の。」 is a slightly softer, more explanatory casual phrasing. 「あの 人、うち の 兄貴
      だ よ。」 is a very casual, almost slangy way to refer to one's elder brother, using 「うちの」 (uchi no)
      for 'my' and 「兄貴」 (aniki) as a familiar term for an elder brother.

    nuance: The polite form 「です か」 is suitable for a semi-formal interaction between colleagues. The question
      uses 「あの」 to refer to a car some distance from both speakers, implying a car that may not be immediately
      obvious. Adding 「ね」 can soften the question slightly, seeking shared confirmation. The casual 「君のか？」
      uses 「君」 (kimi), a slightly less formal way to address someone, and drops the polite ending, suitable
      for a more informal context. 「あの 車、君 の？」 is an even more abbreviated and casual question. 「もしかして、あの
      車、あなた の です か？」 adds 「もしかして」 to express a slight uncertainty or a tentative guess, making the question
      very polite.

      and the overall polite structure ending in 「ようです」, suggesting a careful observation in a business
      context. Adding 「ね」 can slightly soften the formality, inviting agreement. Using 「みたいです」 instead
      of 「ようです」 is a common, slightly more casual way to express 'seems like' while maintaining politeness.
      「あの 提案、ちょっと 問題 が ある よう だ。」 is a plain, less formal version. 「どうも あの 提案 は 問題 が 多い らしい。」 uses 「どうも」
      to express a feeling or impression, and 「らしい」 to indicate information based on hearsay or observation,
      making it a more informal yet thoughtful observation.

          - あれ は いつ も 私 を 泣か せ ます。
        english: That thing (over there) always makes me cry.
        hint: 「あれ」 is a pronoun for a thing far from both speaker and listener, but it doesn't modify
          a noun directly. We're looking for a word that acts as an adjective to modify 'song'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 悲しい 歌 は いつ も 私 を 泣か せ ます。
        english: This sad song (near me) always makes me cry.
        hint: 「この」 refers to something near the speaker. We're looking for a demonstrative that indicates
          distance from both speaker and listener.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 悲しい 歌 は いつ も 私 を 泣か せ ます。
        english: That sad song (near you) always makes me cry.
        hint: 「その」 refers to something near the listener. We're looking for a demonstrative that indicates
          distance from both speaker and listener.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの、悲しい 歌 は いつ も 私 を 泣か せ ます。
        english: Um, the sad song always makes me cry.
        hint: Here, 「あの」 is used as an interjection to get attention or show hesitation, not to indicate
          the location of the song. We're looking for 「あの」 in its demonstrative sense.
    scene: A person is listening to music on their headphones, reflecting on a particularly emotional
      song they've heard many times.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The use of `~ます` in 「泣かせます」 indicates a polite register. 「あの悲しい歌」 refers to a song that is
      emotionally distant or a memory, prompting a reflective and personal response. The plain form 「泣かせる」
      is less formal. 「泣かせちゃうんだ」 adds a nuance of inadvertently or unintentionally crying, often with
      a slight emotional emphasis, and is a casual, expressive form. 「あの 悲しい 歌 は いつ も 泣ける ん だ よ ね。」 uses
      the potential form 「泣ける」 (can cry), implying that the song has the effect of making one cry, often
      with a feeling of being moved. 「もう、あの 悲しい 歌 は いつ も 泣か せ て くる から 困る よ。」 is a very casual, expressive
      complaint, using 「〜てくる」 to indicate something that 'comes at you' and 「困る」 to express being troubled
      by it.
  - english: Please take that bag over there.
    japanese:
      - '{あの} カバン を 取っ て ください。'
      - '{あの} カバン 取っ て くれる？'
      - '{あの} カバン を 取っ て 頂け ます か？'
      - '{あの} カバン、取っ て！'
      - すみ ませ ん、{あの} カバン を お 願い し ます。
    english_literally: That bag (over there) please take.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ を 取っ て ください。
        english: Please take that (bag near you).
        hint: 「それ」 is a pronoun referring to something near the listener, not modifying a noun that is
          far from both. We're looking for a demonstrative that modifies a noun and indicates distance
          from both speaker and listener.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ に ある カバン を 取っ て ください。
        english: Please take the bag here.
        hint: 「ここ」 refers to a location near the speaker. We're looking for a demonstrative that indicates
          distance from both speaker and listener, modifying 'bag'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - そこ に ある カバン を 取っ て ください。

          a noun directly. We're looking for a word that acts as an adjective to modify 'bag'.
      - competing_japanese:

      - competing_japanese:
          - その カバン を 取っ て ください。
        english: That bag (near you) is yours?
        hint: 「その」 refers to something near the listener. We're looking for a demonstrative that indicates
          distance from both speaker and listener.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの、カバン を 取っ て ください。
        english: Um, please take the bag.
        hint: Here, 「あの」 is used as an interjection to get attention or show hesitation, not to indicate
          the location of the bag. We're looking for 「あの」 in its demonstrative sense.
    scene: A mother tells her child to grab a bag from a rack near the front door, which is a few steps
      away.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「取ってください」 is a standard polite request commonly used by a mother instructing a
      child. 「あのカバン」 directs attention to an item that is visually distinct and slightly distant from
      both the speaker and listener, common in everyday instructions. 「取ってくれる？」 is a more casual and softer
      request. 「取っていただけますか？」 is a very polite and formal request, suitable for professional or formal
      settings, but less common for a mother to a child. 「あの カバン、取って！」 is a direct and somewhat demanding
      command, very casual. 「すみません、あの カバン を お 願い し ます。」 is an extremely polite and indirect way to make
      a request, showing deference.
  - english: Do you remember that time we went to Kyoto?
    japanese:
      - '{あの} 時、京都 に 行っ た の 覚え てる？'
      - ねぇ、{あの} 時、京都 に 行っ た こと 覚え てる？
      - そう いえ ば、{あの} 時、京都 行か なかっ た っけ？
    english_literally: That time, Kyoto to went, remember?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 時、京都 に 行っ た の 覚え てる？
        english: Do you remember this time we went to Kyoto?
        hint: 「この時」 refers to a time or moment that is recent or currently relevant. We're looking for
          「あの」 to refer to a shared memory from the more distant past.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 時、京都 に 行っ た の 覚え てる？
        english: Do you remember that time (you just mentioned) we went to Kyoto?
        hint: 「その時」 refers to a time near the listener or a time already brought up in the conversation.
          We're looking for 「あの」 to refer to a specific shared past memory that is not immediately in
          focus.
      - competing_japanese:
          - いつ 京都 に 行っ た の 覚え てる？
        english: Do you remember when you went to Kyoto?
        hint: 「いつ」 is an interrogative adverb asking 'when', not referring to a specific, known past time.
          We're looking for 「あの」 to point to a particular time in shared memory.
    scene: Two old friends are casually chatting and reminiscing about past trips.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「あの時」 refers to a shared memory, a past event that is distant in time for both speakers. The
      casual plain form 「覚えてる？」 is natural between close friends. 「ねぇ」 and 「そういえば」 are common conversational
      fillers that initiate a topic. The use of 「〜たこと」 emphasizes the experience, and 「〜なかったっけ？」 is a
      casual way to seek confirmation about a past event.
  - english: Regarding that matter we discussed yesterday, has there been any progress?
    japanese:
      - '{あの} 件 です が、何 か 進展 あり まし た か？'
      - '{あの} 件、その 後 どう なり まし た か？'
      - 昨日 お 話し し た {あの} 件 です が、進捗 は いかが です か？
    english_literally: That matter, but, any progress was there?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 件 です が、何 か 進展 あり まし た か？
        english: Regarding this matter (here), has there been any progress?
        hint: 「この件」 refers to a matter that is current, present, or immediately at hand. We're looking
          for 「あの」 to refer to a topic previously discussed, hence 'distant' from the immediate conversation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 件 です が、何 か 進展 あり まし た か？
        english: Regarding that matter (you just mentioned), has there been any progress?
        hint: 「その件」 refers to a matter that is near the listener or has just been brought up. We're looking
          for 「あの」 to refer to a topic already known to both speakers but not physically present.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 何 か 進展 あり まし た か？
        english: Has there been any progress?
        hint: This phrase asks about general progress without specifying the topic. We're looking for
          「あの」 to explicitly refer to a particular known matter.
    scene: Two colleagues are having a formal discussion in an office, referring to a topic they discussed
      previously.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「あの件」 refers to a topic or issue that is known to both speakers but is not physically present
      or immediately at hand, often something discussed previously and thus "distant" in the conversation's
      immediate focus. The polite 「〜です が」 softens the inquiry, and 「何か 進展 あり まし た か」 is a standard formal
      business query for updates. 「その後 どう なり まし た か？」 asks about the outcome, while 「進捗 はいかがですか？」 asks
      about the progress.
  - english: Please hand me that ruler over there on the desk.
    japanese:
      - 机 の 上 の {あの} 定規 を 取っ て ください。
      - 机 の 上 の {あの} 定規、取っ て くれる？
      - すみ ませ ん、机 の 上 の {あの} 定規 を お 願い し ます。
    english_literally: Desk's top of that ruler please take.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 定規 を 取っ て ください。
        english: Please hand me this ruler (near me).
        hint: 「この定規」 refers to a ruler that is near the speaker. We're looking for 「あの」 to specify a ruler
          that is physically distant from both speaker and listener.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 定規 を 取っ て ください。
        english: Please hand me that ruler (near you).
        hint: 「その定規」 refers to a ruler that is near the listener. We're looking for 「あの」 to specify a
          ruler that is physically distant from both speaker and listener.
      - competing_japanese:
          - どれ を 取っ て ください？
        english: Which one should I take?
        hint: 「どれ」 is an interrogative pronoun asking 'which one' among multiple options, not pointing
          to a specific distant item. We're looking for 「あの」 to indicate a specific, distant ruler.
    scene: A student asks a teacher to hand them a specific ruler that is on a desk across the room.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「あの」 clearly indicates the ruler is physically distant from both the student and
      the teacher. The polite request 「〜てください」 is appropriate for a student addressing a teacher. The
      more casual 「〜くれる？」 is used when the speaker is a student, which is still respectful but less formal.
      「すみません、〜をお願いします」 is a very polite and indirect way to make a request, showing deference.
  - english: Ladies and gentlemen, that plane over there is about to depart.
    japanese:
      - 皆 様、{あの} 飛行 機 が ま も なく 出発 いたし ます。
      - お 客 様、{あの} 飛行 機 が もう すぐ 出発 し ます。
      - 間 も なく、{あの} 飛行 機 が 離陸 し ます。
    english_literally: Everyone, that plane is soon departing.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 飛行 機 が ま も なく 出発 いたし ます。
        english: Ladies and gentlemen, this plane (the one we are on) is about to depart.
        hint: 「この飛行機」 refers to the plane that is physically near the speaker or the one they are on.
          We're looking for 「あの」 to specify a plane that is visible but distant.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 飛行 機 が ま も なく 出発 いたし ます。
        english: Ladies and gentlemen, that plane (near you) is about to depart.
        hint: 「その飛行機」 refers to a plane near the listener. We're looking for 「あの」 to specify a plane that
          is visible but distant from both speaker and listener.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 飛行 機 が ま も なく 出発 いたし ます。
        english: Ladies and gentlemen, the plane is about to depart.
        hint: This phrase asks about general progress without specifying the topic. We're looking for
          「あの」 to explicitly point to a particular, visible plane.
    scene: An airport announcement is made to passengers waiting in a lounge, referring to a plane visible
      on the tarmac.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「あの飛行機」 points to a specific plane that is visible but distant, appropriate for an airport
      announcement. 「皆様」 is a formal address to a group. 「〜いたします」 is a humble form used to elevate the
      action of departing, suitable for formal announcements. 「お客様」 is another polite way to address customers.
      「もうすぐ出発します」 is slightly less formal but still polite. 「離陸します」 specifies 'take-off' rather than just
      'departure'.
  - english: I can't forget that summer.
    japanese:
      - '{あの} 夏 を 忘れ られ ない。'
      - '{あの} 夏、忘れ られ ない なぁ。'
    english_literally: That summer, cannot forget.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 夏 を 忘れ られ ない。
        english: I can't forget this summer.
        hint: 「この夏」 would refer to the current or very recent summer. We're looking for 「あの」 to express
          a nostalgic feeling about a more distant, past summer.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 夏 を 忘れ られ ない。
        english: I can't forget that summer (you just mentioned).
        hint: 「その夏」 refers to a summer that was recently brought up in the conversation. We're looking
          for 「あの」 to refer to a shared memory that is not immediately in focus.
    scene: A person is looking through old photo albums, remembering a significant summer from their past.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: Using 「あの」 with 「夏」 (natsu) evokes a specific, often emotionally charged, past memory that
      is distant in time but shared or understood by the listener. The plain negative potential form 「忘れられない」
      (wasurerarenai) conveys a strong personal feeling. Adding 「なぁ」 makes the reflection even more wistful.
  - english: That old castle is said to be haunted.
    japanese:
      - '{あの} 古い お 城 は 幽霊 が 出る そう です。'
      - '{あの} 古い お 城 に は 幽霊 が 出る らしい よ。'
      - '{あの} お 城、幽霊 が 出る って さ。'
    english_literally: That old castle ghosts appear so it is said.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 古い お 城 は 幽霊 が 出る そう です。
        english: This old castle (near us) is said to be haunted.
        hint: 「この」 refers to something physically near the speaker. We're looking for 「あの」 to refer to
          a castle that is likely well-known but physically distant or not immediately visible.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 古い お 城 は 幽霊 が 出る そう です。
        english: That old castle (near you) is said to be haunted.
        hint: 「その」 refers to something physically near the listener. We're looking for 「あの」 to refer to
          a castle that is likely well-known but physically distant or not immediately visible.
    scene: Two people are sitting at a cafe, discussing local legends or historical sites, referring to
      a well-known castle in the region.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: 「あの古いお城」 refers to a landmark known to both speakers, often implying a shared understanding
      of its distance or historical context. 「幽霊が出るそうですね」 (yuurei ga deru sou desu ne) uses the reportative
      「そうです」 (it is said) and polite 「です」, making it suitable for sharing information. 「幽霊が出るらしいよ」 (yuurei
      ga deru rashii yo) uses 「らしい」 for information based on observation or rumor, combined with 「よ」 for
      a casual, informative tone. 「幽霊が出るってさ」 (yuurei ga deru tte sa) is a very casual, conversational
      way to report hearsay.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 「あの」 consistently functions to specify a noun
  that is perceived as being distant from both the speaker and the listener, whether physically or conceptually
  (e.g., in memory or general knowledge). The chosen politeness level or nuance within the sentence is
  determined by the surrounding verb conjugations and sentence-ending particles, not by 「あの」 itself. Pay
  close attention to the context to distinguish its demonstrative function from its use as an interjection.
