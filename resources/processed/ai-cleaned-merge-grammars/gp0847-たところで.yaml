    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たところで」 is derived from combining the past tense form of a verb (た形), the noun 「ところ」 (tokoro) meaning 'place' or 'situation', and the particle 「で」 (de), indicating the circumstances or conditions. The phrase literally translates to 'in the situation after doing'. Over time, it has evolved to express the idea that even after a certain action has occurred, the outcome is still undesirable or futile.",
    "writeup": "「たところで」 combines the past tense (た form) of a verb with 「ところで」 to express the idea that even if something were to happen, the result would be unfavorable or inconsequential. It conveys a strong sense of futility or resignation. Think of it as \"even if (this happened), it wouldn't matter\" or \"even if (this happens), it won't make a difference.\" Typically, the second half of the sentence expresses a negative or undesirable outcome. You'll often see adverbs like 「いくら」 (how much) or 「どんなに」 (no matter how) preceding the verb to emphasize the lack of impact.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When differentiating between these similar expressions, remember that 「たところで」 carries a strong connotation of futility or a negative, predetermined outcome. It implies that the action or state described in the first clause will not lead to a desired or effective result, often due to an inherent impossibility or a deep sense of resignation. In contrast, 「ても」 is a broader conditional. 「にせよ・にしろ」 primarily present alternative possibilities or acknowledge conditions without necessarily implying futility. Lastly, 「たって」, while also indicating 'even if', tends to suggest a more defiant or resistant tone rather than a fatalistic one. Choose 「たところで」 when you want to emphasize the ultimate pointlessness or negative certainty of a situation.",
