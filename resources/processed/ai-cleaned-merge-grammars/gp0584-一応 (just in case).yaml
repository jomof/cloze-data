    "etymology": "The term 一応 is composed of 一 (ichi), meaning \"one,\" and 応 (ō), meaning \"response\" or \"application.\" Originally, it may have signified a preliminary or tentative response. Over time, this evolved to mean 'for the time being' or 'just in case,' implying a minimal or precautionary action.",
    "writeup": "一応 is an adverb that indicates performing an action as a precaution, or merely to ensure something, even if the necessity is not absolute. It implies taking a minimal step to prevent a potential issue or to fulfill a basic requirement.",
    "false_friends": [
        {
            "term": "一応",
            "meaning": "more or less, for the time being, tentatively・roughly",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike this usage of 「一応」 which implies taking a precaution or doing something just to be sure, 「一応 (more or less)」 indicates a state that is not perfect or complete, but is sufficient for the moment or for the time being. It often carries a nuance of inadequacy."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「万が一」 emphasizes a low probability event and is used for serious contingencies, whereas 「一応」 is for more common precautionary measures. 「万が一」 carries a stronger sense of potential danger or significant consequence."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「念のため」 is very similar to 「一応」 in meaning 'just in case', but tends to imply a more deliberate, potentially more important precaution, often for something that requires prior thought or for a specific safety measure. 「一応」 can be more casual and spontaneous."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The adverb 「一応」 has two primary nuances that students often confuse. This entry focuses on its use for taking precautions or doing something 'just to be sure'. However, 「一応」 can also mean 'more or less' or 'for the time being', indicating that something is not perfect but sufficient for the current situation. Distinguishing these two uses is critical. Furthermore, while 「万が一」 also deals with preparedness, it is reserved for rare or unlikely events with potentially significant consequences, whereas this nuance of 「一応」 applies to more common, everyday precautionary measures or confirmations. Choose 「一応」 for routine caution and 「万が一」 for remote but serious possibilities. 「念のため」 is another common expression for 'just in case', often used when a more significant or careful precaution is being taken, compared to the potentially more casual and quick action implied by 「一応」.",
