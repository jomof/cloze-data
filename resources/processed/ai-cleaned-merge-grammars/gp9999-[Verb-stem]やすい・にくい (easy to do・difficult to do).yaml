pronunciation:
  katakana: ヤスイ・ニクイ
  romaji: yasui・nikui
formation:
  Verb [ます-stem] + やすい: Indicates ease of performing the verb's action, functioning as an い-adjective.
  Verb [ます-stem] + にくい: Indicates difficulty of performing the verb's action, functioning as an い-adjective.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: Expresses the inherent ease or difficulty of performing an action.
  nuance: Describes the intrinsic characteristic of an action, indicating how easy or difficult it is
    to perform or how resistant it is to being performed. This is not about a temporary state, but a fundamental
    quality. For example, a chair might be '座りやすい' (suwaruyasui) due to its design, regardless of who
    is sitting on it.
etymology: The suffixes やすい (yasui) and にくい (nikui) derive from the classical Japanese adjectives 易し (yashi),
  meaning 'easy' or 'prone to,' and 難し (katashi), meaning 'difficult' or 'hard to.' Over time, they lost
  their independent adjectival status and became productive suffixes that attach to verb stems. This evolution
  highlights their function in describing an inherent quality or tendency of an action, rather than just
  a temporary state. The kanji 易 (i) means 'easy' or 'change,' while 難 (nan) means 'difficult.'
writeup: The suffixes やすい (yasui) and にくい (nikui) are appended to the ます-stem of verbs to express the
  inherent ease or difficulty of performing an action. They function grammatically like い-adjectives,
  meaning they can be conjugated for tense and negation, and can directly modify nouns. When using やすい,
  you are describing something as being 'easy to do' or 'easy to be done.' This often points to a characteristic
  of the object or situation that facilitates the action. For instance, a pen that is '書きやすい' (kakiyasui
  - easy to write with) implies the pen's design or functionality makes writing simple. Conversely, にくい
  indicates that something is 'difficult to do' or 'hard to be done.' Like やすい, this difficulty is inherent
  to the object or situation. A book that is '読みにくい' (yominikui - hard to read) might have small print
  or complex prose, making the act of reading inherently challenging for most people. It's crucial to
  understand that these suffixes describe an objective characteristic, rather than a subjective ability.
  While a learner might find a certain task '難しい' (muzukashii - difficult), describing it with にくい implies
  the task *itself* presents inherent challenges for anyone attempting it. Both やすい and にくい can be used
  across various registers, from casual to polite.
false_friends:
  - term: '[Verb-stem]がたい (difficult to)'
    meaning: difficult to do (emotionally/practically impossible)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜がたい」 often implies a strong emotional or moral barrier, or a fundamental impossibility (e.g.
      「信じがたい」 shinji-gatai - hard to believe). It's typically used with abstract concepts or actions that
      are conceptually difficult. In contrast, 「〜にくい」 describes a general, physical, or practical difficulty
      (e.g. 「読みにくい」 yomi-nikui - hard to read due to small print or complex text), which is more objective.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-stem]がたい (difficult to)
  - term: '[Verb-stem]やすい (prone to)'
    meaning: prone to doing, tends to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While morphologically identical, this use of 「〜やすい」 describes a tendency or susceptibility,
      often unintentional (e.g. 「風邪をひきやすい」 kaze o hikiyasui - prone to catching a cold). The primary meaning
      of 「〜やすい」 covered here focuses on the *ease* with which an action can be performed. Context usually
      clarifies which nuance is intended.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-stem]やすい (prone to)
  - term: 簡単だ・難しい
    meaning: easy / difficult
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「簡単だ」 and 「難しい」 are independent adjectives that describe nouns or concepts. They can describe
      an action, but they don't attach directly to verbs in the same way. 「〜やすい・にくい」 are suffixes that
      become part of the verb phrase, describing an *inherent* quality of how the action is performed
      due to the object or situation. For example, 「この本は{読みにくい}です」(Kono hon wa yominikui desu - This book
      is hard to read) implies the book *itself* has qualities (e.g. tiny font) that make it hard to read.
      「この本を読むのは{難しい}です」(Kono hon o yomu no wa muzukashii desu - Reading this book is difficult) is a more
      general statement about the act of reading it, which could be due to external factors or the reader's
      skill.
    grammar_point: い-Adjectives (adjectives ending in い)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To summarize the distinctions: while 「簡単だ」 and 「難しい」 are standalone adjectives
  describing general ease or difficulty, 「〜やすい」 and 「〜にくい」 are auxiliary adjectives that attach to verb
  stems, characterizing the inherent ease or difficulty of performing an action due to the nature of the
  object or situation. The additional nuance of 「〜やすい」, meaning ''prone to,'' indicates a tendency rather
  than just simplicity of action, and should be understood from context or by the nature of the verb (e.g.,
  verbs related to unintended occurrences often take the ''prone to'' meaning).'

          to comprehend.

post_example_writeup: The examples provided illustrate how やすい and にくい convey an inherent quality of ease
  or difficulty related to an action, often tied to the object or the manner in which the action is performed.
  Pay close attention to the context to distinguish this meaning from the 'prone to' nuance of やすい or
  general statements of difficulty.
