  Verb masu-stem + やすい: Indicates that an action is easy to perform or that something is susceptible to

  Verb masu-stem + にくい: Indicates that something is difficult to do, often due to an inherent quality
    or objective circumstance.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: casual
  function: Expresses the ease or difficulty of performing an action, or a tendency/predisposition for
    something to happen.
  nuance: やすい can indicate inherent ease or a tendency (often negative). にくい implies objective or inherent
    difficulty.
  grammatical-role: Functions grammatically like an い-adjective, modifying verbs to describe the ease
    or difficulty of their execution.
  logical-flow: Connects an action to an inherent ease or difficulty in performing it due to the nature
    of the object, subject, or environment.
  temporal-flow: Applies to actions in the present or future, or past if conjugated to the past tense,
    indicating a persistent or inherent characteristic.
etymology: The suffix 「やすい」 originates from the classical Japanese adjective 「安し」(やすし), meaning 'easy,'
  'peaceful,' or 'cheap.' When affixed to a verb stem, it conveys the idea that the action is readily
  or simply carried out, or that the subject effortlessly falls into a particular state. Similarly, 「にくい」
  originates from the classical Japanese ku-form ending of adjectives expressing difficulty. Its root
  is directly connected to the adjective 「難い」(かたい) (or 「かたし」 in classical form), meaning 'difficult' or
  'hard,' which shares the kanji 難. This ku-form combined with the masu stem of verbs, developing into
  the modern ~にくい construction. Both 「やすい」 and 「にくい」 function as auxiliary adjectives, describing an inherent
  quality related to the ease or difficulty of a verb's action.
writeup: "The grammar points 「V-stem + やすい」 and 「V-stem + にくい」 are versatile expressions used to describe\
  \ the ease or difficulty with which an action can be performed or something can be affected. Both attach\
  \ to the masu-stem of verbs and conjugate exactly like い-adjectives. This fundamental grammatical behavior\
  \ allows them to modify verbs, describing an inherent quality of the action itself. For instance, they\
  \ function in a sentence much like an adjective modifying a noun; here, they modify the verb. This linguistic\
  \ structure makes them a cohesive pair, describing two ends of a spectrum: simplicity versus challenge.\
  \ \n\nWhen indicating **ease of action**, 「やすい」 suggests that an activity is simple, convenient, or\
  \ straightforward to do. For example, a 'comfortable chair' (座りやすい椅子) is easy to sit on. This usage\
  \ is objective and descriptive. Conversely, when expressing a **tendency or predisposition**, 「やすい」\
  \ often implies that something is 'prone to' or 'likely to' occur. This nuance frequently carries a\
  \ slightly negative or undesirable connotation, especially when describing faults, vulnerabilities,\
  \ or habits. For instance, 'a person who gets angry easily' (怒りやすい人) is prone to anger. However, it\
  \ is not always negative; it can also describe a natural characteristic, such as 'children easily catch\
  \ colds' (子供は風邪をひきやすい).\n\nOn the other hand, 「にくい」 indicates that an action is **difficult to perform**.\
  \ This difficulty typically stems from an inherent quality of the object, a lack of necessary skill,\
  \ or an objective circumstance that makes the action challenging. For example, 'this pen is hard to\
  \ write with' (このペンは書きにくい) implies a problem with the pen itself. The core nuance of 「にくい」 emphasizes\
  \ **objective or inherent difficulty**, distinguishing it from other expressions that convey subjective\
  \ discomfort or moral impossibility. Understanding the context is key to discerning whether 「やすい」 indicates\
  \ inherent ease or a natural, sometimes problematic, tendency, and whether 「にくい」 points to an objective\
  \ practical difficulty."
false_friends:
  - term: がち
    meaning: tend to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「やすい」 can express a tendency or being 'prone to', 「がち」 more strongly implies a frequent,
      habitual tendency, often undesirable, and can attach to nouns or verb stems. 「やすい」 can refer to
      an inherent characteristic or susceptibility, not necessarily a repeated action.
    grammar_point: がち (tend to)
  - term: がたい
    meaning: hard to do; difficult to
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both 「にくい」 and 「がたい」 mean 'hard to do,' 「がたい」 implies a strong emotional or moral impossibility,
      making it difficult to do something against one's feelings or principles. 「にくい」 refers to practical
      or inherent difficulty.
    grammar_point: がたい (hard to do)
  - term: づらい
    meaning: hard to do; difficult to (due to discomfort)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Both 「にくい」 and 「づらい」 mean 'hard to do,' but 「づらい」 emphasizes difficulty caused by the speaker's
      personal discomfort, pain, or psychological burden, making the action unbearable. 「にくい」 refers to
      an inherent, objective difficulty.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[masu-stem]+づらい (difficult to due to discomfort)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「やすい」's nuance of 'prone to' and 「がち」, consider
  the emphasis. 「がち」 often highlights a recurring habit, whereas 「やすい」 describes a fundamental susceptibility.
  For differentiating 「にくい」, 「づらい」, and 「がたい」, the nature of the difficulty is key. Use 「にくい」 when the
  difficulty arises from an objective characteristic or external factor. Use 「づらい」 when the difficulty
  is personal, caused by discomfort, pain, or an emotional burden. Use 「がたい」 when the action is difficult
  due to a strong emotional or moral barrier, making it nearly impossible or unbelievable. For example,
  if a chair is uncomfortable to sit in, it is 「座りづらい」; if the chair is broken and hard to sit on, it
  is 「座りにくい」; if it is hard to accept someone's unkind words, it is 「受け入れがたい」.

post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「やすい」 and 「にくい」 seamlessly integrate into various contexts
  to express both inherent ease and difficulty, as well as natural tendencies. Their conjugation mirrors
  that of い-adjectives, making them flexible and commonly used grammatical structures. Paying attention
  to context will help you discern whether 'easy to do', 'prone to', or 'difficult to do' is the intended
  meaning, especially when dealing with the more nuanced examples. 「にくい」 consistently points to an objective
  or inherent reason for difficulty. It's about the physical characteristics of an object, the inherent
  nature of a situation, or a characteristic of a person that makes an action practically challenging.
  Pay close attention to this nuance to differentiate it from expressions indicating subjective discomfort
  or moral impossibility.
