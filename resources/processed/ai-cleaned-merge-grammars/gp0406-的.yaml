    "etymology": "The kanji 的 (teki) originally means \"target\" or \"mark.\" In this grammatical context, it shifts to indicate something is \"-like\" or \"-al\" in relation to the noun it modifies. It suggests that something pertains to or characterizes that noun.",
    "writeup": "的 (teki) is a suffix that functions similarly to the English suffixes \"-ly\", \"-like\", or \"-al.\" It's attached to nouns to create な-adjectives or adverbs. When describing a noun, 的 is followed by な (na). When describing a verb, it's followed by に (ni). For example, 経済的 (keizaiteki) means \"economical\" or \"financial\" and is used to describe nouns. 積極的に (sekkyokuteki ni) means \"actively\" or \"positively\" and is used to modify verbs. It is also used with people's names to mean that someone's action is typical of that person. This can be used both positively or negatively.",
