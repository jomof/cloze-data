    "etymology": "的 originally meant \"target\" or \"goal\" (的 (mato) still means target in Japanese). The usage evolved to indicate something relating to or characterizing a particular target or category. It acts as a suffix to create adjectival nouns (na-adjectives) and adverbs.",
    "writeup": "的 (teki) is a suffix in Japanese with two main functions. First, it indicates something is \"within the category of\" or \"regarding\" something, similar to \"as\" or \"for.\" Second, when used with people's names, it highlights a characteristic associated with that person. As a suffix, 的 is often similar to English adjective endings like \"-ly,\" \"-like,\" and \"-al.\"  To use 的, attach it to a noun. When describing another noun, 的 is followed by な, making it a な-adjective. When describing a verb, it's followed by に, making it an adverb.\n\nFor example, \"国民的アイドル\" (kokumin-teki aidoru) means \"national idol\" or \"a star in terms of the nation.\"\n\nImportant Considerations:\nThe nuance can change the meaning.\n\n的 can also be used with people's names to emphasize a quality associated with that person. This can be positive or negative, like saying \"That's so [person's name]!\"",
