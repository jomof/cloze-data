    "etymology": "The kanji 的 (teki) originally means \"target\" or \"mark.\" In this grammatical context, it shifts to indicate something is \"-like\" or \"-al\" in relation to the noun it modifies. It suggests that something pertains to or characterizes that noun.",
    "writeup": "的 (teki) is a suffix that attaches to nouns, transforming them into な-adjectives or adverbs. It has two primary functions. The first use is akin to expressing something \"considering\" or \"within the category of\" the preceding noun, often translated as '~ly', '~like', or '~al'. When modifying a noun, 的 is followed by な. When modifying a verb, it is followed by に.\n\nThe second common use of 的 is specifically with people's names. It highlights that an action or characteristic is precisely what one would expect from that particular person, serving to describe something as typical of them. This can be used in both positive and negative contexts.\n\nNote on Nuance: To grasp the unique essence of 的, it is useful to compare it with another common suffix, 圏 (ken).\n\n*   圏 (ken) implies something occurring literally within the sphere or domain of the preceding noun. For example, 英語圏 (eigo-ken) means the \"English-speaking world\" – a physical or linguistic domain.\n*   的 (teki), on the other hand, conveys something being true or applicable *from the perspective* or *standpoint* of the preceding noun. It indicates that a statement or description holds true when viewed through the lens of that noun. For instance, 国民的 (kokumin-teki) means \"national\" in the sense of \"speaking in terms of the nation.\"\n\nThus, when you wish to convey a statement valid from a particular standpoint or a characteristic typical of something, 的 is the precise choice.",
