    "details": {
        "Register": "Often used in emotional or reflective contexts."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「に」, in this context, adds a nuance of emphasis or emotion to the hypothetical statement. It is related to the use of 「に」 to indicate a cause or reason, implying that the speaker is dwelling on the consequences of a different choice or situation. Over time, this has evolved into an expression of regret or sympathy.",
    "writeup": "The 「に」 particle, when used at the end of a sentence, expresses a feeling of regret, disappointment, or wistful thinking about a hypothetical situation. It suggests that things could have been different, often implying a sense of blame or self-reproach. Think of it as saying \"if only...\" or \"should have...\" with a bit of emotional weight.\n\nIt is commonly used with the plain form (informal) of verbs and i-adjectives, or with the plain past form of nouns and na-adjectives (e.g., Verb/Adj-い (informal) + でしょう/だろう + に, or Na-Adj stem/Noun + (だった) + でしょう/だろう + に). It is frequently combined with 「でしょう」 or 「だろう」 to add a layer of conjecture to the hypothetical.\n\nThis usage of 「に」 is similar to 「のに」, but it tends to express a stronger, more personal sense of regret or disappointment, often with a subtle implication of a missed opportunity or a situation that 'should have been'.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The level of regret can vary depending on the context and the speaker's tone.\n*   It is more common in spoken language when expressing personal feelings.",
