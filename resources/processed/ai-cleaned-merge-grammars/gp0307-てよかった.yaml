    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てよかった」 is derived from the combination of the 「て」 form of a verb and 「よかった」, which is the past form of the adjective 「いい」 (good). The 「て」 form serves to connect the preceding action or state with the subsequent feeling of 'goodness' or satisfaction about the outcome. Historically, the connective function of the 'te-form' has been robust in Japanese, allowing various consequences or states to be linked. In this case, it specifically links an action to a positive past evaluation, resulting in the meaning of 'I'm glad that...'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てよかった」 expresses a feeling of relief or satisfaction that something happened or was done. It's equivalent to saying \"I'm glad that...\" or \"It's good that...\" in English. This expression is broadly used across various contexts, from daily casual conversations to more formal settings.\n\nIt can also express relief that something *didn't* happen, using one of two negative forms:\n*   **「なくてよかった」 (nakute yokatta):** This form indicates relief that something did not occur. It often carries a slightly more formal or objective nuance and can be found in both spoken and written Japanese. It is formed by connecting the 「ない」 form of the verb (without the final い) to 「くてよかった」.\n*   **「ないでよかった」 (naide yokatta):** This form also indicates relief that something did not occur, but it is typically used in more casual, spoken Japanese. It emphasizes the choice or action of *not doing* something. It is formed by connecting the 「ない」 form of the verb to 「でよかった」.\n\nWhile both negative forms convey a similar meaning, 「ないでよかった」 is generally more common in everyday, informal speech, whereas 「なくてよかった」 might appear in slightly more formal contexts or written language.",
