    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てよかった」 is derived from the combination of the 「て」 form of a verb and 「よかった」, which is the past form of the adjective 「いい」 (good). The 「て」 form connects the action with the feeling of 'goodness' or satisfaction about the result.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てよかった」 expresses a feeling of relief or satisfaction that something happened or was done. It's equivalent to saying \"I'm glad that...\" in English. It can also express relief that something *didn't* happen, using the negative form 「なくてよかった」 or 「ないでよかった」.\n\n*   「てよかった」 (te yokatta): I'm glad that (something happened).\n*   「なくてよかった」 (nakute yokatta): I'm glad that (something didn't happen). This form is often perceived as more formal or reserved for written contexts.\n*   「ないでよかった」 (naide yokatta): I'm glad that (something didn't happen). This form is more common in casual, spoken Japanese.",
