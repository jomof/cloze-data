    "etymology": "The word 「予定 (yotei)」 itself is composed of 「予 (yo)」 meaning 'beforehand' or 'in advance' and 「定 (tei)」 meaning 'to decide' or 'determine'. So, 「予定」 literally means something that has been decided in advance.",
    "writeup": "「予定だ」 functions similarly to 「つもりだ」 ('to intend to do'), but with a stronger emphasis on having a **concrete plan** rather than a mere intention. Therefore, 「予定だ」 is often used for things that are formally scheduled, such as appointments or organized events. To use 「予定だ」, attach it to the dictionary form of a verb, or to a noun by adding 「の」. It's **essential** to include 「だ」 or 「です」 after 「予定」; otherwise, it will be interpreted as simply modifying the preceding verb or noun, leading to unnatural phrasing.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes a *planned* event for a college student, making 「予定だ」 more appropriate than 「つもりだ」 which could just be a loose intention. The casual context and male speaker's 「ぜ」 indicate a firm, decided plan shared with a close friend."
