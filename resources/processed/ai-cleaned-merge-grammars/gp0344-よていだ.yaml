    "writeup": "「予定だ」 functions similarly to 「つもりだ」 ('to intend to do'), but with a stronger emphasis on having a **concrete plan** rather than a mere intention. Therefore, 「予定だ」 is often used for things that are formally scheduled, such as appointments or organized events. To use 「予定だ」, attach it to the dictionary form of a verb, or to a noun by adding 「の」. It's **essential** to include 「だ」 or 「です」 after 「予定」; otherwise, it will be interpreted as simply modifying the preceding verb or noun, leading to unnatural phrasing.",
