        "usage-context": "Typically used in formal writing, reports, academic discourse, or formal speeches. It adds information in a somewhat rigid or official tone.",
        "function": "To introduce additional information that supplements, intensifies, or amplifies what has already been stated. It can emphasize a cumulative effect, whether positive or negative.",
        "nuance": "Implies accumulation or augmentation.

The increase can be positive (e.g., adding more good qualities) or negative (e.g., adding more problems)."
    },
    "etymology": "「加えて」 is the te-form of the verb 「加える (くわえる)」, meaning \"to add,\" \"to append,\" or \"to include.\" By using the te-form, it functions adverbially or as a conjunction, connecting ideas by signifying an additional element or circumstance. Its usage evolved to formally indicate an additive relationship between statements or elements.",
    "writeup": "「加えて (くわえて)」 is a formal Japanese expression that serves as a conjunction, meaning \"in addition to,\" \"not only... but also,\" or \"moreover.\" It is the te-form of the verb 「加える (くわえる)」, which literally means \"to add.\" This grammatical pattern is commonly used in formal contexts such as written reports, academic papers, news articles, and formal speeches.\n\nThis expression is highly versatile and can be used in several formations. The most common formation involves attaching 「に加えて」 directly after a noun, indicating that something is being added to that noun. For instance, 「暑さに加えて (atsusa ni kuwaete)」 means \"in addition to the heat.\"\n\nIt can also function as a conjunctive adverb, connecting two clauses. In this usage, it often appears preceded by 「それに (sore ni)」, forming 「それに加えて」, which explicitly means \"on top of that\" or \"furthermore.\" However, 「加えて」 can also stand alone to link sentences or clauses, indicating an additional point without the explicit 「それに」.\n\nAnother specific formation involves listing multiple nouns and then introducing a final, often impactful, item with 「加えて」. For example, 「A、B、加えて C (A, B, kuwaete C)」 emphasizes C as an additional significant element to A and B.\n\n「加えて」 frequently highlights that the second piece of information intensifies, magnifies, or completes the first. This augmentation can be either positive, indicating an accumulation of good qualities, or negative, highlighting an increase in undesirable circumstances. Its usage emphasizes the cumulative impact of multiple factors.",

            "nuance": "「はもちろん」 often implies that the first item is a given, obvious, or universally acknowledged fact, and then adds something surprising or extra. It literally means 'of course' or 'needless to say'."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「ばかりでなく」 is slightly less formal than 「加えて」 and frequently implies that the second item is unexpected or noteworthy, often highlighting a broader scope than initially perceived. It emphasizes that it's 'not just' the first thing, but also the second, implying a wider range of applicability or involvement."

            "nuance": "「をはじめ」 is used when the first item mentioned is a representative example from a larger group or category. It sets the primary example and then implies that other similar items also exist. It literally means 'starting with X' or 'X and others'."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「加えて」, 「はもちろん」, 「ばかりでなく」, and 「をはじめ」 all convey an idea of addition or inclusion, their nuances differ. 「加えて」 is a more neutral and formal way to simply add information, emphasizing accumulation or intensification. 「はもちろん」 highlights that the first point is obvious or a given, then adds something extra. 「ばかりでなく」 emphasizes that the second point is not just an addition but often an unexpected or significant one. 「をはじめ」 indicates that the first item is merely one example among many, serving as a representative. Choosing the correct expression depends on the specific context and the intended emphasis of the additional information.",

The use of 「に加えて」 here highlights the combination of two adverse weather conditions, rain and strong wind, intensifying the overall negative weather picture for the listener/viewer.",
            "etymology": "The word 「風 (kaze)」, meaning wind, has ancient origins, appearing in early Japanese texts and poetry as a fundamental natural phenomenon. Its kanji, 風, depicts a sail and a bird, symbolizing movement and air currents. 「冷たい (tsumetai)」 is an adjective indicating coldness. The combination here paints a vivid picture of harsh weather conditions. 「吹いております」 uses the humble form of 「吹いています」, further emphasizing the formality of the report, common in public announcements and broadcasting.

            "etymology": "「英語 (eigo)」 and 「フランス語 (furansugo)」 are direct translations of English and French languages, using 「語 (go)」 for language. The phrasing 「〜話せる よう に なり たい」 is a common Japanese construct for expressing a desire to gain a new ability, literally \"want to become able to speak.\""

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "pessimistic",
            "nuance": "The casual 「苦しい」 for 'difficult' and the particle 「まで」, emphasizing 'even' food prices, convey a sense of exasperation and a growing burden. 「に加えて」 here highlights a cumulative negative effect, where one problem (rising rent) is compounded by another (rising food costs), leading to a worsening financial situation.",
            "etymology": "「家賃 (yachin)」 refers to house rent, 「食費 (shokuhi)」 to food expenses. Both are standard terms for daily living costs. The phrase 「生活 が 苦しい (seikatsu ga kurushii)」 is a common expression for experiencing hardship in daily life, suggesting financial strain. This example illustrates the practical, everyday application of 「に加えて」 in lamenting the worsening of daily life due to multiple rising costs."

            "nuance": "The use of 「でした」, the polite past form, maintains a formal and objective tone when discussing the proposal. 「加えて」 here acts as a conjunctive adverb, introducing an additional negative point that further validates the initial criticism, amplifying the reasons for the proposal's rejection in a business context.",
            "etymology": "「新鮮味 (shinsenmi)」 refers to novelty or freshness, and 「欠けて いた (kakete ita)」 means 'was lacking'. 「高額 (kōgaku)」 refers to a high amount or cost. This sentence structure demonstrates how 「加えて」 can connect two independent clauses, both describing negative aspects, to create a stronger, more conclusive statement about a subject. The formal tone is suitable for an internal business discussion, especially when evaluating performance or proposals. "

This highlights the synergistic effect of both practices.",
            "etymology": "「規則 正しい 運動 (kisoku tadashii undō)」 means 'regular exercise', and 「バランス の 取れた 食事 (baransu no toreta shokuji)」 means 'balanced diet'. 「不可欠 (fukaketsu)」 means 'indispensable' or 'essential'. This sentence uses straightforward, clear language to convey important health information, with 「に加えて」 stressing the combined importance of multiple factors for well-being. "

            "etymology": "「体力 が 落ちる (tairyoku ga ochiru)」 means 'physical strength declines', and 「物忘れ が ひどい (monowasure ga hidoi)」 means 'severe forgetfulness'. This self-reflective statement, particularly the use of 「ひどい」 for 'severe', highlights the personal impact of these changes. The sentence structure clearly separates the two observations but uses 「加えて」 to link them as compounding issues, painting a fuller picture of the speaker's concerns about aging. "

It highlights the combination of amenities that make the city appealing.",
            "etymology": "「交通 の 便 (kōtsū no ben)」 means 'convenient transportation', and 「緑 (midori)」 refers to greenery or nature. 「住み やすい (sumi yasui)」 combines 「住む (sumu - to live)」 with the suffix 「〜やすい (yasui - easy to do)」。 This example effectively uses 「に加えて」 to list compelling features, making it suitable for persuasive descriptions in sales or tourism, emphasizing the composite appeal of a place.

            "etymology": "「料理 (ryōri)」 means 'food' or 'cuisine', 「美味しく ない (oishikunai)」 means 'not delicious', 「店員 (ten'in)」 means 'staff' or 'clerk', and 「態度 が 最悪 (taido ga saiaku)」 means 'attitude is terrible'.
