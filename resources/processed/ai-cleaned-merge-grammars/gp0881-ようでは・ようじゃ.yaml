    "etymology": "「よう」 comes from 「様 (さま)」, meaning 'manner' or 'appearance.' 「では」 is a conjunction expressing 'if.' Thus, 「ようでは」 literally suggests 'if it is in this manner/appearance,' implying the speaker's perception or assumption of a situation.",
    "writeup": "「ようでは」 combines the auxiliary verb 「様」 ('manner' or 'seeming') with 「では」, a conjunction often used as an abbreviation of 「それなら」 in expressing 'if.' 「ようでは」 itself carries the meaning of 'if,' emphasizing that what precedes it is unconfirmed or based on an assumption. It can be translated as 'if it is the case that' or 'if that which seems to be true.' In many cases, 「ようでは」 introduces a negative evaluation, suggesting that if the preceding condition is true, a particular undesirable outcome will result.\n\n「ようでは」 typically follows verbs in any of their standard forms. It highlights the condition or appearance of what precedes it, based on the speaker's observations. Therefore, it often reflects the speaker's subjective (negative) opinion about what they perceive to be true.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   「ようじゃ」 is a more casual form of 「ようでは」.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies a situation where the speaker is making a judgment based on a perceived pattern of behavior, which aligns with 「ようでは」's nuance of evaluating a situation based on observation, rather than a general conditional implied by 「ては」."
