    "etymology": "ようでは is derived from 「様 (you)」 meaning 'manner' or 'seeming,' combined with 「では (de wa)」, a conjunction often used as an abbreviation of 「それでは (sore dewa)」, expressing 'if'. Therefore, the grammar point suggests a hypothetical situation based on an observed or perceived manner.",
    "writeup": "「ようでは」 is a conjunction that presents an undesirable situation, assumed to be factual. It is a combination of the auxiliary verb 「様」 ('manner' or 'seeming') and 「では」, a conjunction frequently used as an abbreviation of 「それなら」 in expressing 'if'. Due to this, 「ようでは」 itself often has the meaning of 'if', with extra focus on the fact that (A) is unconfirmed or only being guessed at. This may be translated as 'if it is the case that (A)', or 'if that which seems to be (A) is true'.\n\nIn most cases, 「ようでは」 will be used to make an evaluation that if (A) is true, then some particular negative result will arise from it. 「ようでは」 puts extra focus on the appearance or condition of (A), based on what is observable by the speaker. In this way, it is often the speaker's subjective (negative) opinion about what they perceive to be true.\n\n「ようでは」 primarily appears after verbs in any of their standard forms. 「ようじゃ」 is a more casual variant.",
