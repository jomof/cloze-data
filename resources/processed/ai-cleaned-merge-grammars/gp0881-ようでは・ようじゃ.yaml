    "etymology": "「よう」 comes from 「様 (さま)」, meaning 'manner' or 'appearance.' 「では」 is a conjunction expressing 'if.' Thus, 「ようでは」 literally suggests 'if it is in this manner/appearance,' implying the speaker's perception or assumption of a situation.",
    "writeup": "「ようでは」 combines the auxiliary verb 「様」 ('manner' or 'seeming') with 「では」, a conjunction often used as an abbreviation of 「それなら」 in expressing 'if.' 「ようでは」 itself carries the meaning of 'if,' emphasizing that what precedes it is unconfirmed or based on an assumption. It can be translated as 'if it is the case that' or 'if that which seems to be true.'In many cases, 「ようでは」 introduces a negative evaluation, suggesting that if the preceding condition is true, a particular undesirable outcome will result. It typically follows verbs in any of their standard forms, as well as い-adjectives, な-adjective stems, and nouns followed by の. It highlights the condition or appearance of what precedes it, based on the speaker's observations. Therefore, it often reflects the speaker's subjective (negative) opinion about what they perceive to be true.Note that 「ようじゃ」 is a more casual form of 「ようでは」.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ようだ」 expresses a general observation or inference, whereas 「ようでは」 is used to make a judgment based on that observation, often with a negative connotation."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid mixing up 「ようでは」 with similar expressions like 「ては」 or 「ようだ」, remember that 「ようでは」 carries a stronger sense of subjective evaluation and often implies a negative consequence or undesirable situation based on a perceived or assumed condition. 「ては」 is a more general 'if' or 'when', while 「ようだ」 simply expresses an observation.",
