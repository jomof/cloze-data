    "etymology": "The word 「むしろ」 originally comes from the kanji 「寧ろ」, meaning \"preferably\". The kanji 「寧」 also appears in 「丁寧 (ていねい)」, meaning \"polite\" or \"careful,\" suggesting a careful consideration when making a choice or clarification.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「むしろ」 serves to express a preference, make a correction, or provide a more accurate or suitable depiction of a previously mentioned idea. It is akin to using \"rather,\" \"instead,\" or \"preferably\" in English. This adverb frequently appears at the beginning of a sentence or a clause, clarifying or refining a preceding statement. It often works in conjunction with comparative structures like 「より」, emphasizing the preferred option or the more precise description.",
