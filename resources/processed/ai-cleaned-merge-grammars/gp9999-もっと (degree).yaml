jlpt: N5
etymology: The word もっと (motto) is believed to derive from 尤も (もっとも - mottomo), which originally meant
  "most" or "extremely" in a definitive sense, often implying "most reasonable" or "most justifiable."
  Over time, もっと evolved to primarily signify "more" or "further," losing some of the superlative or definitive
  nuances of its origin. This transition reflects a shift from an absolute "most" to a comparative "more,"
  emphasizing an increase in degree rather than a final, highest point.
writeup: '**もっと** is an adverb primarily used to express an increase in degree, quantity, or intensity.
  It translates most commonly to "more," "further," or "still more" in English. It can modify verbs, adjectives,
  and other adverbs, indicating that an action, state, or quality should be enhanced or continued to a
  greater extent.When used with verbs, **もっと** suggests doing something to a higher degree or for a longer
  duration. For example, 「もっと食べる」 (motto taberu) means "to eat more." When modifying adjectives, it intensifies
  the quality, such as 「もっと大きい」 (motto ookii) meaning "even bigger" or "more big." With adverbs, it further
  strengthens their meaning, like 「もっと早く」 (motto hayaku) meaning "even faster" or "more quickly."**もっと**
  is a versatile and common word used across all registers of Japanese, from very casual conversations
  among friends to formal speeches. It is an essential building block for expressing comparison and desire
  for improvement or increase.### Important Considerations:*   **Placement:** **もっと** usually precedes
  the word it modifies.*   **Implicit Comparison:** While **もっと** doesn''t explicitly form a comparative
  sentence (like "X is more than Y"), it inherently implies a comparison with the current state or expectation.*   **Desire
  vs. Fact:** Depending on context and surrounding grammar, **もっと** can express a desire ("I want more...")
  or simply state a fact ("It is more...").'
false_friends:
  - term: もっとも
    meaning: most; extremely; indeed; reasonable
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: もっとも is a superlative adverb meaning "most" or "extremely," indicating the highest degree
      or the logical truth. もっと simply means "more" or "further," indicating an increase in degree from
      a previous state.
    grammar_point: もっとも (most, extremely)
  - term: さらに
    meaning: furthermore; again; still; even more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: さらに often implies an additional step or continuation, a deeper level, or an accumulation ("in
      addition to what exists"). もっと focuses purely on increasing the quantity or degree of a single item
      or action.
    grammar_point: 更に (even more)
  - term: より
    meaning: than; from; since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: より is a particle used to form explicit comparisons (e.g., "X より Y のほうが" - Y is more X than
      X). もっと is an adverb that intensifies a single item or action without needing a direct comparison
      object.
    grammar_point: より (comparative)
  - term: いっそう
    meaning: still more; even more; all the more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: いっそう emphasizes that the degree of something has become "even more" pronounced, often implying
      it was already significant. It has a nuance of further intensification. もっと is a more neutral term
      for "more."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:いっそう (still more, even more)
  - term: なんだか
    meaning: somehow; for some reason; vaguely
    kind: antonym
    nuance: なんだか expresses vagueness or uncertainty, the opposite of the specific increase implied by
      もっと. While もっと seeks to quantify or intensify, なんだか indicates an unspecified or vague feeling or
      situation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:なんだか (somewhat)
post_false_friends_writeup: While **もっと**, **もっとも**, **さらに**, **より**, and **いっそう** all relate to intensity
  or comparison, their specific uses and nuances differ. **もっとも** functions as a superlative ("most"),
  while **もっと** is a general intensifier ("more"). **さらに** implies an additional step or accumulation,
  and **いっそう** denotes "even more" with an emphasis on further intensification. **より** is specifically
  for direct comparisons between two entities. Understanding these distinctions is key to precise expression.

  professional enhancement, **もっと** serves as a fundamental building block for articulating quantitative
