        "particle-syntactic-function": "case-marking",
        "function": "Marks the object or cause of an emotion.",
        "nuance": "This usage of 'を' is distinct from its usual function as a direct object marker. It highlights the reason or stimulus behind the emotion.",
        "source": "This usage of を is observed with verbs expressing emotions or psychological states, distinguishing it from the direct object particle.",
        "grammatical-role": "Marks the noun as the object or cause of the emotion verb."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle を originally had a broader range of functions in classical Japanese, including marking location and time. Over time, its usage narrowed, but it retained the ability to mark the object of certain intransitive verbs, especially those related to emotions.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「を」 typically marks the direct object of a transitive verb. However, with verbs describing emotions, feelings, or psychological states, 「を」 marks the *cause* or *object* of that emotion. Think of it as \"feeling X about Y\". Common verbs used in this pattern include: 喜ぶ (yorokobu - to be pleased), 悲しむ (kanashimu - to be sad), 恐れる (osoreru - to fear), 懐かしむ (natsukashimu - to miss), and 悩む (nayamu - to worry). The nuance is that the noun preceding 「を」 is what triggers or brings about the particular emotion.",
