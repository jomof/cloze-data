    "etymology": "The volitional form 「よう」 originates from the verb 「要る(いる)」 meaning \"to need\" or \"to require\". Over time, it evolved to express not just necessity, but also intention and invitation. The polite form 「ましょう」 is thought to be a contraction of 「ます」 + 「よう」.",
    "writeup": "The 「よう」 form is a grammatical construction similar to 「ましょう」, with 「ましょう」 being the polite form. It's used casually to express \"let's\" when making suggestions or \"I shall\" when stating intentions.\n\n**Formation**:\n\n*   **う-verbs**: Change the final 「う」 sound to its corresponding 「お」 sound, then add 「う」 (e.g., 買う [かう] becomes 買おう [かおう]).\n*   **る-verbs**: Replace 「る」 with 「よう」 (e.g., 食べる [たべる] becomes 食べよう [たべよう]).\n*   **Irregular verbs**: 「する」 becomes 「しよう」, and 「くる」 becomes 「こよう」.\n\nThe 「よう」 form expresses:\n\n*   **Intention** (意志 ishi): Similar to 「〜するつもりだ」, indicating what you plan to do. This is the \"I shall\" meaning.\n*   **Invitation** (勧誘 kan'yuu): Suggesting something, like 「誘う(さそう)」. This is the \"let's\" meaning.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   Don't confuse 「よう」 with 「ようだ」, which describes likeness (similar to 「そうだ」).",
