pronunciation:

  romaji: meku, meita
formation:
  '[Noun] + めく': To show signs of (a noun), to have the appearance of (a noun), to feel like (a noun).
    This form conjugates like a Godan verb.
  '[Noun] + めいた': Noun-modifying form indicating something has the qualities of (a noun). This is the
    past tense form of めく, often used directly before another noun to describe it.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: Often used with abstract nouns or nouns describing atmosphere/qualities, frequently appearing
    in literary or formal contexts rather than everyday conversation.
  function: To express that something has the appearance or characteristics of a specified noun, often
    implying subjectivity or a subtle resemblance rather than a definitive state.
  nuance: Implies a subtle, often subjective, perception that something is showing signs of or has the
    atmosphere/quality of a noun, without necessarily being that noun itself. It suggests an emerging
    state or an inherent quality being observed by the speaker.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a suffix-like verb that attaches to nouns, forming a new verb or an attributive
    form (めいた) modifying a noun.
etymology: 「めく」 is derived from the verb 「兆す(きざす)」, meaning "to show signs of" or "to indicate". Over
  time, 「めく」 evolved to express a sense of resemblance or approximation, often used to describe something
  that has the *feeling* or *appearance* of something else, without actually being it. It's a classical
  Japanese verb stem that has largely fossilized into a suffix-like function in modern Japanese.
writeup: |-
  「めく」 is a unique Godan verb in Japanese that primarily functions as a suffix. It signifies "to show signs of (A)" or "to have the appearance of (A)." It attaches to nouns, reflecting the speaker's personal perception or experience. As 「めく」 itself is a verb, it can conjugate into various forms depending on how it describes the rest of the sentence. When directly modifying a second noun, the past-tense form 「めいた」 is commonly used.

  It's **important** to note that 「めく」 often highlights the speaker's personal feelings about (A) and their subjective perception. The described thing is not necessarily (A) in reality, and the speaker is usually aware of this distinction. This subjective nature is why many of its conjugations, such as imperative or causative forms, are pragmatically very rare or even unnatural, as 'showing signs of' something is generally not an action one can intentionally command or cause another to do.

  「めく」 is often used with established expressions, so it's best to use it with combinations you've encountered before. Some common examples include:
  *   「春めく」 (haru meku): to show signs of spring
  *   「秋めく」 (aki meku): to show signs of autumn
  *   「謎めく」 (nazo meku): to appear mysterious
  *   「皮肉めく」 (hiniku meku): to appear sarcastic
  *   「冗談めく」 (jōdan meku): to appear like a joke
  *   「作り物めく」 (tsukurimono meku): to appear artificial
false_friends:
  - term: ～らしい
    meaning: seems like, appears to be, it is typical of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「めく」 which describes something *showing signs* or *having the appearance* of X, often
      with a subjective or implied non-authenticity, 「らしい」 suggests something *is characteristic of* X
      or appears to be X based on evidence or common understanding.
    grammar_point: らしい (typical of, -like)
  - term: ～みたいだ
    meaning: looks like, seems like (colloquial)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「めく」 conveys a subtle, often inherent quality of 'being like' X, 「みたいだ」 is a more direct
      and colloquial comparison, simply stating that something resembles or appears to be X, without necessarily
      implying the subjective or 'signs of' aspect of 「めく」.
    grammar_point: みたい (appears・resembles)
  - term: ～そうだ
    meaning: it looks like, it seems that (from observation)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「めく」 expresses a perceived or emerging quality of X, often subjective. 「そうだ」, when indicating
      appearance, is based on direct visual observation, stating what something *looks like* or *seems
      like* to the observer at that moment.
    grammar_point: そう (looks or seems like)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between these expressions, consider the degree of resemblance
  and the speaker's perspective. 「めく」 often implies a subtle, perceived resemblance, where something isn't
  quite X but has qualities of X. 「らしい」 suggests a more confirmed, characteristic resemblance. 「みたいだ」
  is a straightforward, general comparison. 「そうだ」 (appearance) is based on immediate sensory input.
examples:
  - english: The sunlight has finally become warm, and the plants by the roadside are showing signs of
      spring.
    japanese:
      - ようやく 日差し が 暖かく なり、道端 の 草木 が {春 めい て} き た。
      - ようやく 日差し が 暖かく なり、道端 の 草木 が {春 めい て} き まし た。
      - ようやく 日差し が 暖かく なり、道端 の 草木 が {春 めい て} き た な。
    english_literally: Finally, the sunlight became warm, and the roadside plants have become spring-like.

          - ようやく 日差し が 暖かく なり、道端 の 草木 が 春 らしく なっ て き た。
          - ようやく 日差し が 暖かく なり、道端 の 草木 が 春 らしく なっ て き まし た。
        english: Finally, the sunlight became warm, and the roadside plants have become characteristic
          of spring.
        hint: 「らしい」 suggests something is characteristic of a noun or typical of it, often based on common
          knowledge or perception, rather than simply showing subtle signs or appearance. We are looking
          for something that subtly *shows signs* of spring, not just *is* spring-like.
    scene: You're observing the slow but sure arrival of spring after a long winter.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The use of 「～て きた」 emphasizes the gradual process of the plants acquiring spring-like qualities,
      reflecting the subtle shift of seasons. It highlights the emergent nature of the spring feeling,
      which is precisely what 「めく」 conveys.
    etymology: The Japanese word for spring, 「春 (はる)」, often implies new beginnings and growth, which
      aligns with the sense of something emerging or 'showing signs' of itself.
  - english: Her mysterious smile made him suspect she was hiding something.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 の {謎 めい た} 微笑み に、彼 は 何 か を 隠し て いる の か と 疑っ た。
      - 彼女 の {謎 めい た} 微笑み から、彼 は 何 か を 隠し て いる の か と 疑念 を 抱い た。
    english_literally: To her mysterious smile, he suspected if she was hiding something.

          - 彼女 の 謎 の 微笑み から、彼 は 何 か を 隠し て いる の か と 疑念 を 抱い た。
        english: To her mysterious smile, he suspected if she was hiding something.
        hint: 「謎の」 describes a noun as simply being mysterious. 「めいた」 implies the smile itself had a subtle,
          inherent quality or atmosphere of mystery, which led to suspicion. We are looking for a smile
          that *radiates* mystery.
    scene: A man is intrigued by a woman's enigmatic expression during a conversation.
    register: formal
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The term 「謎めいた」 attached to 「微笑み」 (smile) indicates that the smile itself possessed an inherent,
      subtle quality of mystery, making it intriguing and leading to suspicion. It describes the appearance
      of the smile as mysterious.
    etymology: 「謎 (なぞ)」 means mystery or riddle, often implying something that is difficult to understand
      or explain. The addition of 「めいた」 suggests that the smile 'took on the quality' of a mystery, making
      it enigmatic.
  - english: He said it as if it were a joke, but for me, it was a serious topic.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は {冗談 めい て} 言っ た が、私 に とっ て は 真剣 な 話題 だっ た。
      - 彼 は {冗談 めい て} 言い まし た が、私 に とっ て は 真剣 な 話題 でし た。

          - 彼 は 冗談 の よう に 言い まし た が、私 に とっ て は 真剣 な 話題 でし た。
        english: He said it like a joke, but for me, it was a serious topic.
        hint: 「のように」 is a direct comparison, meaning "like" or "as if." 「めいて」 describes the *manner* of
          speaking as having the inherent *quality* or *atmosphere* of a joke, suggesting it wasn't a
          direct comparison but a characteristic of his speech. We are looking for speech that *had the
          air of* a joke.
    scene: Someone recounts a conversation where their feelings were hurt by a comment that the other
      person seemed to think was humorous.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: 「冗談めいて」 indicates that the *manner* of his speech had the *quality* of a joke, suggesting
      he spoke lightheartedly or in a jesting way, even if the content itself was serious to the listener.
      It implies a subjective perception of his tone.
    etymology: 「冗談 (じょうだん)」 refers to a joke or jest. When combined with 「めいて」, it describes speech or
      actions that 'appear to be a joke' or 'have the air of a joke', without necessarily being one definitively.
  - english: She clearly showed discomfort at his sarcastic way of speaking.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の {皮肉 めい た} 物言い に、彼女 は 明らか に 不快 感 を 示し た。
      - 彼 の {皮肉 めい た} 物言い に、彼女 は 明らか に 不快 感 を 示し まし た。

        english: She clearly showed discomfort at his sarcastic way of speaking.
        hint: 「皮肉な」 directly states something is sarcastic. 「めいた」 suggests that the 'manner of speaking'
          possessed a *quality* of sarcasm, implying it wasn't explicitly sarcastic but had an inherent
          sarcastic *feel* to it. We are looking for a way of speaking that *had the air of* an omen.
    scene: A woman reacts negatively to a man's cutting remarks in a discussion.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「皮肉めいた」 suggests that his 'manner of speaking' (物言い) possessed a quality of sarcasm or irony,
      rather than merely being sarcastic. It implies that his tone or choice of words had an inherent
      ironic or cynical feel to it.
    etymology: 「皮肉 (ひにく)」 means sarcasm or irony. 「皮肉めいた」 describes something that 'takes on the quality
      of sarcasm' or 'appears sarcastic', highlighting a perceived characteristic in speech or manner.

    japanese:

          - その 絵 は あまり に も 美しく、まるで 作り物 の よう でし た。
        english: That painting was so beautiful, it was like a man-made object.
        hint: 「のよう」 is a direct simile, comparing one thing to another. 「めく」 implies that the painting's
          perfection made it *take on the quality* or *feel* of something artificial, suggesting an inherent
          characteristic rather than just a comparison. We are looking for a painting that *seemed to
          be artificial*.
    scene: Admiring a work of art that looks almost too perfect to be real.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「作り物めく」 used with 「ようだった」 emphasizes that the painting's beauty was so perfect it had the
      *quality* or *feel* of being artificial, almost too flawless to be natural. It highlights the subjective
      impression of artificiality.
    etymology: 「作り物 (つくりもの)」 means a man-made object or artifact. 「作り物めく」 therefore describes something
      that 'appears to be man-made' or 'has the characteristic of being artificial', focusing on its fabricated
      quality.

        english: The story was too convenient; I felt it looked like a lie (was fishy).
        hint: 「っぽい」 means "ish" or "like," often implying a strong resemblance or tendency. 「めいている」 suggests
          the story is *currently possessing a 'lie-like' quality*, making it feel inherently dishonest.
          We are looking for something that *radiates a lie-like quality*.
    scene: Listening to someone's explanation that seems too good to be true.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    nuance: 「嘘めいている」 describes the story as currently possessing a 'lie-like' quality, making it feel
      inherently dishonest or suspicious. The progressive form indicates this feeling is ongoing or perceived
      at the moment of observation.
    etymology: 「嘘 (うそ)」 means a lie or falsehood. 「嘘めいて」 indicates that something 'appears to be a lie'
      or 'has the quality of a lie', suggesting a deceptive appearance.
  - english: Mornings and evenings have become cool, and the scenery has started to take on an autumn

        english: Mornings and evenings have become cool, and the scenery has quite become characteristic
          of autumn.
        hint: 「らしい」 suggests something is characteristic or typical. 「めいて」 suggests the scenery is subtly
          *showing signs* of autumn, conveying an emergent state. We are looking for the scenery to subtly
          *feel like* autumn.
    scene: Writing a letter to a distant friend about the change of seasons.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: 「秋めいて きました」 indicates a gradual shift where the scenery is beginning to *exhibit characteristics*
      of autumn, even if it's not officially autumn yet. It conveys the subtle emergence of the season's
      atmosphere.
    etymology: 「秋 (あき)」 refers to autumn. 「秋めいて」 means to 'show signs of autumn' or 'have an autumn-like
      feel', reflecting the transition of seasons.

        english: Her secret actions piqued the interest of those around her.
        hint: 「秘密の」 describes actions that are simply secret. 「めいた」 suggests her actions inherently possessed
          a *secretive quality*, making them mysterious rather than just being performed in secret. We
          are looking for actions that *radiate secrecy*.
    scene: Observing someone who consistently behaves in an enigmatic way.
    register: formal
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「秘密めいた」 describes her actions as inherently possessing a secretive quality, making them seem
      mysterious and thus piquing others' curiosity. It's not just a secret action, but one that radiates
      secrecy.
    etymology: 「秘密 (ひみつ)」 means secret. 「秘密めいた」 describes something that 'appears secret' or 'has a secretive
      quality', indicating an elusive or mysterious nature.
  - english: Stop saying such omen-like things. Something bad will happen!

          - そんな 縁起 が 悪い こと を 言う の は やめ て。悪い こと が 起こる わ よ。
        english: Stop saying such bad luck things. Something bad will happen!
        hint: 「縁起が悪い」 directly states something is bad luck or an ill omen. 「縁起めいた」 implies the words
          *appear* to be an omen or *have an ominous feel*, suggesting a superstitious interpretation
          rather than a definitive statement of bad luck. We are looking for words that *have the air
          of* an omen.
    scene: A superstitious older woman admonishes a younger person for casually speaking about bad omens.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The older female speaker's choice of 「やめろ」 (an informal imperative) and 「ぞ」 (a male-coded
      emphatic particle) in the first Japanese option, or 「やめて」 (a softer imperative) and 「わよ」 (a female-coded
      emphatic particle) in the second, combined with the superstitious tone of 「縁起めいた」, reinforces a
      scolding or warning typical of an older person to a younger one. 「縁起めいた」 implies something *appears*
      to be an omen, carrying a sense of superstition or potential misfortune, rather than being definitively
      'bad luck'.
    etymology: 「縁起 (えんぎ)」 refers to omens, signs, or auspiciousness. 「縁起めいた」 means to 'appear like an
      omen' or 'have an ominous feel', often implying a superstitious interpretation.
  - english: Her poetry has a deep sadness to it, almost mournful.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 の 詩 に は、深く {悲しみ めい た} もの が ある。

    english_literally: In her poetry, there is something deeply sorrow-like.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 の 詩 に は、深く 悲しい もの が ある。
          - 彼女 の 詩 に は、深く 悲しい もの が あり ます。
        english: Her poetry has something deeply sad.
        hint: 「悲しい」 simply describes something as sad. 「悲しみめいた」 implies that the poetry itself possesses
          a *quality* or *atmosphere* of sorrow, rather than just being sad. We are looking for something
          that *has the air of* sadness.
    scene: Discussing the emotional depth of a poet's work.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「悲しみめいた」 attached to 「もの」 (thing/quality) indicates that the poetry has a profound quality
      or atmosphere of sadness, implying a deeper, more inherent sense of lament. It describes the emotional
      resonance as being mournful in nature.
    etymology: 「悲しみ (かなしみ)」 means sadness or sorrow. When combined with 「めいた」, it describes something
      that 'appears to be sorrowful' or 'has a mournful quality', suggesting an intrinsic emotional tone.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「めく」 and 「めいた」 are particularly useful for expressing
  subtle, often subjective perceptions about something acquiring certain qualities or an atmosphere. The
  verb forms emphasize the *appearance* or *feeling* of a state rather than its definitive existence,
  often evoking a sense of emergence or inherent characteristic.
