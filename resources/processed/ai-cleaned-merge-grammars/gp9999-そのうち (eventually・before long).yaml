formation:
  そのうち: Used as an adverb to indicate that something will happen at an unspecified point in the future,
    implying natural progression or inevitability
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Primarily used in daily conversation to talk about events that are expected to happen
    in the future, but without a precise timeline. It often conveys a sense of natural progression or
    a calm expectation
  function: Temporal adverb indicating an indefinite future
  nuance: Implies that something will occur naturally or in due course, often without requiring immediate
    action or a strict deadline. It suggests a future that is not far off but also not precisely fixed.
    It can convey patience, reassurance, or a gentle inevitability
  counterpoint: すぐに (immediately)・いずれ (someday・eventually)・やがて (before long・eventually)・まもなく (soon)
  colocation: Often used with plain non-past verbs, volitional forms, or expressions indicating a change
    in state
  grammatical-role: Adverbial modifier for a verb or clause
etymology: The phrase 「そのうち」 combines 「その」 (that) and 「うち」 (inside, among). Literally, it can be understood
  as 'within that (time/context)' or 'among those (things that will happen)'. This evolution signifies
  an an event occurring naturally within an implicit future timeframe, emphasizing that it will happen
  without a specific external push or deadline, but rather in due course
writeup: 「そのうち」 is an adverbial expression used to indicate that something will happen at some point in
  the future. It conveys a sense of expectation or mild inevitability, but without specifying an exact
  timeline. Think of it as saying "eventually," "before long," or "in due course." It suggests a natural
  progression or that something is bound to happen without a concrete plan or immediate action. This expression
  is very common in daily conversation and can be used in various contexts, from reassuring someone that
  things will improve to simply stating a future intention. It implies that the event is not immediate
  but is expected to occur within a reasonable, unspecified future. While 「そのうち」 can sometimes imply a
  relatively short timeframe, it's generally more indefinite than words like 「すぐに」 (immediately) or 「まもなく」
  (soon). It's suitable for situations where you don't have a precise schedule but are confident or hopeful
  about a future outcome
false_friends:
  - term: いずれ
    meaning: Someday, eventually, anyway, any of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そのうち」 implies a natural progression or expectation that something will happen relatively
      soon, often within a known context or situation. 「いずれ」 can refer to a more distant or abstract future,
      or an indefinite point without a strong sense of imminence, and can also be used in the sense of
      "in any case" or "any of." This entry refers to the "someday, eventually" nuance.
    grammar_point: いずれ (someday・eventually)
  - term: やがて (before long・eventually)
    meaning: Before long, all too soon, in the end, eventually, nearly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そのうち」 is more casual and implies a natural occurrence within an unspecified but relatively
      near future. 「やがて」 often suggests a more inevitable, sometimes longer, and often more dramatic or
      significant progression towards an outcome, and can sound more formal or literary.
    grammar_point: やがて (before long・eventually)
  - term: まもなく
    meaning: Soon, shortly, before long
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そのうち」 indicates something will happen naturally in the unspecified future, but not necessarily
      very soon. 「まもなく」 implies a definite and immediate future, often within minutes or hours, and carries
      a sense of imminence.
    grammar_point: '<suggest>: まもなく (soon・shortly)'
  - term: とうとう (finally・eventually)
    meaning: Finally, after all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そのうち」 expresses an expectation that something will happen eventually, implying an indefinite
      future point. 「とうとう」 indicates that something has finally happened after a process or waiting, often
      with a sense of relief, resignation, or the culmination of an effort.
    grammar_point: とうとう (finally・eventually)
  - term: 遂に (finally・at last)
    meaning: Finally, at last
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そのうち」 implies an indefinite future point where something will naturally occur. 「遂に」 indicates
      that something has finally happened after a long process, effort, or waiting, often with a sense
      of relief, culmination, or accomplishment. It can also imply a negative outcome that was long anticipated.
    grammar_point: 遂に (finally・at last)
  - term: すぐ (immediately・easily)
    meaning: Immediately, right away, soon, easily
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「そのうち」 implies an indefinite future, "eventually." 「すぐ」 means "immediately" or "right away,"
      indicating a very short or no delay.
    grammar_point: すぐ (immediately・easily)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「そのうち」 from similar expressions, remember that 「そのうち」
  carries a nuance of natural, somewhat indefinite future occurrence without a strong sense of urgency.
  In contrast, 「いずれ」 can be more distant or abstract. 「やがて」 implies a more certain and often longer-term
  progression. 「まもなく」 denotes a very imminent event. Lastly, 「とうとう」 and 「遂に」 describe an event that has
  already happened after a period, marking its culmination, while 「すぐ」 signifies immediate action.
