    "etymology": "「と言う」 (to say) + 「と」 (conditional particle) + 「言う」 (to say) + 「と」 (conjunction). Literally, it suggests \"if you say... then...\" emphasizing the immediate association or consequence that arises upon mentioning something.",
    "writeup": "「と言うと」is a versatile phrase used to express what comes to mind or what association arises when a particular noun or situation is mentioned. It functions similarly to saying \"speaking of...\" or \"when you say...\". It indicates an immediate and often involuntary connection between the topic and the associated thought or image. This connection can be a memory, a typical characteristic, a stereotype, or even a reaction. It can also be used to introduce a situation and its typical consequence, or to highlight how a statement might be perceived, sometimes ironically.",
