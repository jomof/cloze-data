It functions similarly to saying \"speaking of...\" or \"when you say...\". It indicates an immediate and often involuntary connection between the topic and the associated thought or image. This connection can be a memory, a typical characteristic, a stereotype, or even a reaction. It can also be used to introduce a situation and its typical consequence, or to highlight how a statement might be perceived, sometimes ironically.",
