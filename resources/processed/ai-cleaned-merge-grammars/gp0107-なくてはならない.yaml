    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the negative form of a verb (ない), followed by the conjunctive particle て, the topic marker は, and finally ならない, which means 'cannot become' and comes from the negative form of なる (to become).",
    "writeup": "「なくてはならない」 expresses a strong sense of necessity or obligation. It indicates that something **must** be done or is **absolutely required**. Though it translates to \"must do\", a more literal breakdown is \"must not, not do (A)\". This grammar point is generally considered more formal than 「なければいけない」 or 「なくちゃ」, making it suitable for formal writing and speech. However, it's also acceptable in semi-formal contexts. The 「は」 can often be shortened to 「ちゃ」 in casual speech. So, 「なくちゃならない」 is commonly used in casual conversation, often paired with 「いけない」 or 「だめ」.",
