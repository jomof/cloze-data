  katakana: テタマラナイ
  romaji: te tamaranai

jlpt: N2
etymology: The phrase derives from the verb 堪る (tamaru), meaning 'to endure' or 'to bear,' used in its
  negative form 堪らない (tamaranai), which means 'cannot endure' or 'cannot bear.' When connected with the
  て-form of an adjective or a desiderative verb (たい-form), it literally means 'so [feeling/desire] that
  one cannot bear it.' This origin highlights the core nuance of an overwhelming, uncontainable state
  of emotion or physical sensation.
writeup: |-
  This grammar point, てたまらない, is used to express that a feeling or desire is so overwhelming or intense that one cannot bear or endure it. It conveys a strong sense of being unable to control or suppress a particular emotion, physical sensation, or a strong yearning.

  It often implies a subjective and personal experience, suggesting that the speaker is struggling with the intensity of their feelings. While it can be used for both positive and negative emotions, it is frequently encountered with sensations that are difficult to tolerate, such as sleepiness, cold, or pain, or with strong, almost desperate desires.

  **Formation:**
  *   **い-Adjective (stem) + てたまらない**: For example, 嬉しい (ureshii - happy) becomes 嬉しくてたまらない (ureshikute tamaranai - so happy I can't stand it). 眠い (nemui - sleepy) becomes 眠くてたまらない (nemukute tamaranai - so sleepy I can't stand it).
  *   **な-Adjective (stem) + でたまらない**: For example, 心配 (shinpai - worried) becomes 心配でたまらない (shinpai de tamaranai - so worried I can't stand it). 残念 (zannen - regrettable) becomes 残念でたまらない (zannen de tamaranai - so regrettable it's unbearable).
  *   **Verb (たい-form stem) + てたまらない**: For example, 会いたい (aitai - want to meet) becomes 会いたくてたまらない (aitakute tamaranai - want to meet so badly it's unbearable).

  This construction highlights the *unbearable* nature of the feeling, emphasizing the internal struggle or intensity rather than just stating a high degree. It's more dramatic and emotionally charged than simply using an adverb like とても (very) or すごく (extremely).

  - term: てならない
    meaning: can't help but feel; becomes irresistibly so
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: てならない tends to emphasize the natural or spontaneous emergence of a feeling that one simply
      cannot control, often for feelings that well up from within, like worry or curiosity. It can also
      be used for non-emotive things that 'can't help but happen.' It sometimes carries a slightly more
      formal or literary tone than てたまらない.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:てならない (can't help but feel)
  - term: て仕方がない
    meaning: cannot help but feel; it's unbearable; there's no way around it
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Literally meaning 'there's no way,' て仕方がない conveys that the feeling is so strong, there is
      nothing one can do to change it or escape it. It is highly interchangeable with てたまらない and often
      expresses the same sense of overwhelming intensity.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:て仕方がない (unbearably・cannot help but)
  - term: てしょうがない
    meaning: cannot help but feel; it's unbearable
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a more casual or colloquial variant of て仕方がない. It carries the same meaning of an uncontrollable
      or unbearable feeling, emphasizing the lack of choice or ability to suppress it.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:てしょうがない (unbearably・cannot help but)
post_false_friends_writeup: While てたまらない, てならない, て仕方がない, and てしょうがない are often used interchangeably to
  express strong, uncontrollable feelings, a subtle distinction can sometimes be drawn. てたまらない strongly
  emphasizes the unbearable aspect, suggesting a personal struggle to endure the intensity of the feeling.
  てならない can imply a more spontaneous or natural surge of emotion. て仕方がない and its more casual variant てしょうがない
  convey a sense of being powerless against the feeling, as if there is 'no way' to avoid or alleviate
  it. In many everyday contexts, however, these forms are used quite similarly to express an overwhelming
  emotional or physical state.
