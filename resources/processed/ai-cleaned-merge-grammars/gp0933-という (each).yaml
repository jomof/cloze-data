    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "usage-context": "Used in both formal and casual settings to emphasize the totality or singularity of a noun.",
        "function": "To intensify the meaning of a noun by highlighting every instance of it, or to single out a particular instance for emphasis.",
        "nuance": "Conveys a sense of 'every single one without exception' or 'this specific one, above all others.' It adds a strong, often emphatic, quality to the noun."
    },
    "etymology": "「という」 is derived from the verb 「言う (iu)」 (to say). In this grammar point, it's used to specify or emphasize each and every instance of the preceding noun. Its origin links to the idea of 'that which is called Noun', reinforcing the definition of the noun itself in a complete sense.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「Noun という Noun」 is a highly effective way to convey the meaning of 'every single (Noun)' or 'each and every (Noun)' in Japanese. While often used for simple emphasis, its literal meaning can be understood as 'every (Noun) that could be called an (Noun)', underscoring the comprehensive nature of the statement. The repetition of the noun linked by 「という」 draws attention to the totality or exceptional nature of the item being discussed.\n\nWhen this structure is applied to abstract concepts like 「今日 (kyō)」 (today) or 「今度 (kondo)」 (next time), it takes on a more specific emphatic meaning, akin to 'Today of all days' or 'This time, above all others'. This highlights that among all possible instances of that abstract concept, the current one holds particular significance, usually indicating a heightened sense of determination, finality, or exasperation. The specific implication is typically made clear by the context that immediately follows in the sentence.\n\nThis grammatical pattern is versatile and can be found across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal declarations, its exact nuance being shaped by the surrounding vocabulary and context. It is a powerful tool for adding weight and comprehensiveness to one's expressions.",
