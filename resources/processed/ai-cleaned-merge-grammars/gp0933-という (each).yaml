    "writeup": "One use of the extremely common 「という」 structure is to pair identical nouns to convey the meaning of \"every single (A).\" This expression is often used for emphasis, but the literal meaning is \"every (B) that could be called an (A).\" 「という」 is placed between the same noun, repeated.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   When used with abstract expressions like 「今日」 (today), it generally means \"(A) of all (A)'s,\" implying this particular one has something special about it. This is often used for emphasis.\n",
    "etymology": "「という」 is a combination of 「と」 (a particle indicating content or definition) and 「言う」 (to say). In this context, it implies 'that which is called'. When repeating a noun with 「という」 between them, it emphasizes that every instance of that noun is being referred to.",
