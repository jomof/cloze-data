    "etymology": "姿 (sugata) originally meant 'shape' or 'form.' Over time, it expanded to include the idea of outward appearance, encompassing not only physical shape but also attire and manner. The use of 姿 as a suffix emphasizes the visual aspect of a noun, verb, or adjective, focusing on how something or someone appears to an observer.",
    "writeup": "When used as a suffix, 姿 (sugata) describes someone's outward appearance. This can relate to what they're wearing, their overall shape, body type, or style. 姿 is often translated as “looking,” “wearing,” “clad in,” or “performing.” It focuses primarily on how someone appears to an observer and can also describe the observer's impression of that person's presence or absence.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\n*   After nouns, の is sometimes omitted, especially after kanji compounds, but usually not after simple words like 人, 時, 元, etc.",
