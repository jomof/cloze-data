    "etymology": "The word 「姿 (sugata)」 originally meant 'shape' or 'form.' Over time, it evolved to include the broader sense of outward appearance, including what someone is wearing or how they are acting. It carries a nuance of how someone presents themselves to the world.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Noun+の・Verb[dictionary]・Adjective+姿」 is used as a suffix to describe someone's outward appearance or figure. It highlights how a person or occasionally an animal appears to an observer, emphasizing their physical form, what they are wearing, or their manner while performing an action. This expression captures the **visual impression** or **specific presence** created by the subject.\n\n**Usage Notes:**\n*   When attached to a noun, it typically requires the particle の (e.g., 子供の姿 - a child's figure). However, for kanji compounds, の can sometimes be omitted (e.g., 花嫁姿 - bridal figure).\n*   When attached to a verb, the verb must be in its dictionary form (e.g., 走る姿 - a running figure) or progressive ている form (e.g., 働いている姿 - a working figure).\n*   When attached to an adjective, the adjective maintains its dictionary form (e.g., 美しい姿 - a beautiful figure).\n\n「姿」 is not merely a description of facts; it often conveys the observer's impression or feeling about the subject's appearance or presence. It highlights the aesthetic or emotional impact of what is seen.",

If you are describing a specific pose, a way someone is dressed, or their very presence, 「姿」 is often the best choice.",
