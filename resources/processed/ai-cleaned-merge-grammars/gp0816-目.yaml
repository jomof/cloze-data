        "part-of-speech": "suffix",

        "function": "Used to indicate the ordinal number of something, like \"first\", \"second\", \"third\", etc.",
        "colocation": "Requires a number followed by a counter word (e.g., 一人目, 二回目).",

    },
    "etymology": "The kanji 「目」 originally means \"eye\" or \"vision,\" but in this grammatical context, it represents a point in a sequence, similar to marking or numbering items as they are observed or considered. This usage likely stems from the idea of sequentially 'eyeing' or distinguishing items in a series, implying a linear progression or count.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「目」 (me) is used to create ordinal numbers in Japanese, indicating the position or order of something within a sequence. It is attached to a numerical value and a counter word, forming a compound that precisely specifies the 'nth' item, occurrence, or person. For example, 「一人目」 (hitori me) means \"the first person,\" 「二回目」 (nikai me) means \"the second time/occurrence,\" and 「三冊目」 (san satsu me) means \"the third volume/book.\"\n\nThis grammatical construct is fundamental for expressing chronological order, numerical sequence, or repeated actions. It emphasizes the sequential nature of the item being counted, distinguishing it from simply stating a quantity or a general ordinal position (which might use 「番目」). The choice of counter word is crucial, as 「目」 adapts to various classifiers such as people (人), times/occurrences (回), objects (個, 冊), or units of time (年, 週).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   When counting people, 「一人目」 (hitori me) and 「二人目」 (futari me) use irregular readings for 'one' and 'two' respectively. For three and above, regular counter readings apply (e.g., 「三人目」 san nin me).\n*   「目」 is often used in contexts implying a progression, a cumulative count, or a specific moment within a series.",

            "meaning": "ordinal number suffix (e.g., first, second)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「目」, 「番目」 is more general and doesn't necessarily require a specific counter word, though it still often follows a number to indicate order. 「番目」 can be used when the type of item being counted is already clear from context, or when the counting is abstract."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「目」 and 「番目」 are used to indicate ordinal numbers, their usage subtly differs. 「目」 is almost always attached directly after a number and a specific counter (e.g., 「一人目」 for 'first person', 「二回目」 for 'second time'). This emphasizes the 'count' of that specific item in a sequence. On the other hand, 「番目」 is more general and indicates rank or order without necessarily being tied to a specific counter (e.g., 「一番目」 for 'the first one', 「二番目」 for 'the second one'). It's often used when simply listing items by their order or when the type of item is obvious.",
