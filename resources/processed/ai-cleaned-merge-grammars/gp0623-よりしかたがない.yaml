    "etymology": "The structure 「よりしかたがない」 is composed of 「より」 (from 「よる」, meaning \"to depend on\" or \"to be based on\"), 「仕方」 (shikata, meaning \"way\" or \"method\"), 「が」 (a particle), and 「ない」 (nai, meaning \"not\"). It literally translates to \"there is no way other than...\", conveying the sense of inevitability or lack of alternatives. The phrase expresses that there is no other method or way to deal with a situation.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「よりしかたがない」 is often seen as a set phrase and conveys that \"there is no choice but (A)\" or that \"(A) cannot be helped.\" It consists of 「より」, the noun 「仕方」 (\"way\" or \"method\"), 「が」, and 「ない」. When preceded by a verb in its dictionary form, it expresses a lack of alternatives. Sometimes, 「が」 is dropped between 「仕方」 and 「ない」, forming 「よりしかたない」.\n\nA similar pattern with almost the same meaning is 「よりほかにない」. The only difference is that this structure expresses that there is no \"other\" alternative, rather than no \"method.\" The noun 「他」 (\"other\") and 「に」 simply replace 「仕方」 and 「が」. As with 「仕方が」, the 「に」 is often dropped in 「他に」, forming 「より他ない」.\n\nBoth 「よりしかたがない」 and 「よりほかにない」 tend to express a particular evaluation of (A) that cannot be helped or denied, or simply that \"given the situation, (A) cannot be avoided.\"",
