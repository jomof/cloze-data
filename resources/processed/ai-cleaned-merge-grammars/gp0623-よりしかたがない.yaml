        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "To express inevitability or the absence of any alternative method or course of action.",
        "nuance": "Implies a sense of resignation or a forced conclusion due to external circumstances or a lack of other viable options. It often conveys a feeling that one must accept a situation or perform an action because no other way exists."
    },
    "etymology": "The structure 「よりしかたがない」 is composed of 「より」 (from 「よる」, meaning \"to depend on\" or \"to be based on\"), 「仕方」 (shikata, meaning \"way\" or \"method\"), 「が」 (a particle), and 「ない」 (nai, meaning \"not\"). It literally translates to \"there is no way other than...\", conveying the sense of inevitability or lack of alternatives. The phrase expresses that there is no other method or way to deal with a situation.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「よりしかたがない」 is often seen as a set expression that conveys the meaning \"there is no choice but (A)\" or that \"(A) cannot be helped.\" It consists of 「より」, the noun 「仕方」 (\"way\" or \"method\"), 「が」, and 「ない」. When preceded by a verb in its dictionary form, it emphasizes a lack of alternatives. Sometimes, 「が」 is dropped between 「仕方」 and 「ない」, forming 「よりしかたない」.\n\nA similar pattern with nearly the same meaning is 「よりほかにない」. The key distinction is that this variation emphasizes the absence of any \"other\" alternative, rather than simply the lack of a \"method.\" In this structure, the noun 「他」 (\"other\") and the particle 「に」 replace 「仕方」 and 「が」 respectively. Similar to 「仕方が」, the 「に」 is often dropped in 「他に」, resulting in 「より他ない」.\n\nBoth 「よりしかたがない」 and 「よりほかにない」 typically express a particular evaluation of a situation (A) that cannot be avoided or denied. They convey that, given the circumstances, (A) is the unavoidable outcome or action.",
