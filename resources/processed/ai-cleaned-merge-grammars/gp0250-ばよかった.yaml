    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ばよかった」 is composed of the conditional particle 「ば」 attached to a verb, followed by 「よかった」, the past form of the adjective 「良い」 (ii, good). The 「ば」 particle indicates a hypothetical condition. Therefore, 「ばよかった」 literally translates to \"it would have been good if (A)\", where A is the action the speaker regrets not doing. Note that いい conjugates as よい but in the past tense it is よかった.",
    "writeup": "「ばよかった」 is a common expression used to convey regret that something was not done. It combines the conditional particle 「ば」 with 「よかった」, the past form of the *i*-adjective 「良い」 (*ii*, good). This construction often translates to \"I wish I had done (A)\" or \"I should have done (A).\" It is used after verbs, which must be in their conditional form (i.e. 「ば」 form).\n\nAs 「ば」 highlights hypothetical situations, 「ばよかった」 literally means \"it would have been good if (A),\" where (A) is the action the speaker wishes had occurred.\n\nIt's directly opposite to 「ばいい」, the non-past version, which expresses \"it would be good if (A).\"",
