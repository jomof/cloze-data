    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ばよかった」 is derived from the conditional form 「～ば」 (if) combined with 「よかった」 (was good). Literally, it translates to \"it would have been good if…\". The 「ば」 highlights a hypothetical situation, and 「よかった」 expresses the speaker's sentiment that the situation would have been preferable to the actual outcome.",
    "writeup": "「ばよかった」 is used to express regret or a wish that something had been done differently. It combines the conditional particle 「ば」 with the past tense of the い-adjective 「良い」 (いい), which conjugates to 「よかった」. This construction translates to \"I wish I had done (A)\" or \"I should have done (A).\" It is used after verbs conjugated into the conditional 「ば」 form. It's **important** to note the contrast with 「ばいい」, the non-past version, which means \"it would be good if (A)\".",
