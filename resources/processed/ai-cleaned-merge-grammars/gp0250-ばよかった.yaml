    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ばよかった」 is derived from the conditional form 「～ば」 (if) combined with 「よかった」 (was good). Literally, it translates to \"it would have been good if…\". The 「ば」 highlights a hypothetical situation, and 「よかった」 expresses the speaker's sentiment that the situation would have been preferable to the actual outcome.",
    "writeup": "「ばよかった」 is used to express regret or a wish that something had been done differently. It combines the conditional particle 「ば」 with the past tense of the い-adjective 「良い」 (いい), which conjugates to 「よかった」. This construction translates to \"I wish I had done (A)\" or \"I should have done (A).\" It is used after verbs conjugated into the conditional 「ば」 form. The conjugation to the conditional 「ば」 form varies by verb group:\n\n*   For Group 1 verbs (五段動詞, Godan Doushi), the final う sound changes to え, and ば is added (e.g., 話す → 話せば).\n*   For Group 2 verbs (一段動詞, Ichidan Doushi), the final る is dropped, and れば is added (e.g., 食べる → 食べれば).\n*   Irregular verbs する (suru) and 来る (kuru) become すれば and 来れば respectively.\n\nIt's **important** to note the contrast with 「ばいい」, the non-past version, which means \"it would be good if (A)\".",
