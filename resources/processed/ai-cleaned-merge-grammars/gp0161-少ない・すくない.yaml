    "etymology": "The word 「少ない (sukunai)」 comes from the verb 「少なく (sukuna)」, which means 'to diminish' or 'to reduce.'

It's **important** to remember that 「少ない」 cannot be used directly before a noun, except in relative clauses. Instead, use it as a predicate, describing the noun with 「が」.  Its antonym is 「多い (ooi)」, which means \"many\" or \"much.\"",
