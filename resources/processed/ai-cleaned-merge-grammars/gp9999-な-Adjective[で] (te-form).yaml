pronunciation:

formation:
  な-Adjective Stem + で: Connects two clauses, where the first clause describes a state or quality using
    a な-adjective.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used when linking two clauses where the first clause describes a state or quality using
    a な-adjective, often implying a natural consequence or sequential action.
  function: Connects clauses; expresses cause, reason, or concurrent state.
  nuance: The な-adjective + で form directly links a quality or state to the subsequent clause, often suggesting
    a logical flow or inherent causality. It is more integrated than using separate conjunctions like
    「から」 or 「ので」.
etymology: The connective 「で」, when used with な-adjectives and nouns, originates from the classical copula
  「に て」. 「に」 (ni) served as a locative particle, indicating 'at' or 'in', and 「て」 (te) was a general connective
  or gerundive suffix. Over time, 「に て」 evolved phonetically into 「で」, allowing it to function as a way
  to connect states, conditions, or reasons, expressing 'being in a state and then' or 'because of being
  in a state'. This origin highlights its fundamental role in linking descriptive elements within a sentence.
writeup: |-
  The な-Adjective + 「で」 form is the te-form of な-adjectives. It serves a crucial role in Japanese grammar by allowing you to connect clauses, express reasons, or describe simultaneous states.

  There are two primary functions:

  1.  **Connecting Clauses (and, being)**: Similar to how you use the te-form of verbs, な-adjective + 「で」 can link two or more clauses describing qualities or states. The nuance is typically 'and' or 'being (such-and-such)'. The first clause describes a state or characteristic, and the second clause adds more information or describes an action related to that state. For example, describing a room as 「静かで、快適です」 (quiet and comfortable).

  2.  **Expressing Cause or Reason (because, so)**: This form can also indicate a cause or reason for the action or state in the following clause. The reason often stems naturally from the quality described by the な-adjective. For instance, 「道が複雑で、迷ってしまった」 (The road was complicated, so I got lost). Here, the complexity of the road is the direct reason for getting lost.

  While 「で」 itself is a neutral form, the overall register of the sentence will be determined by the ending of the final clause (e.g., using です/ます for polite, or plain form for casual). This form creates a smooth and concise connection between descriptive elements and subsequent actions or observations.
false_friends:
  - term: から (because・so)
    meaning: because, so
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「から」 explicitly states a reason, often with a subjective nuance or a strong causal link. な-Adjective
      + 「で」 often implies a more natural or inherent reason stemming from the quality of the adjective.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:から (because・so)
  - term: ので (because・so)
    meaning: because, so
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ので」 also states a reason, but is generally softer and more objective than 「から」. It's often
      used when providing an explanation or asking for understanding. な-Adjective + 「で」 is more integrated
      as a direct connection of qualities or states.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ので (because・so)
  - term: い-Adj-stem]くて (and)
    meaning: and (connecting adjectives/states), because (expressing reason)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the equivalent form for い-adjectives, forming their connective/causal te-form. While
      functionally similar, the conjugation rules differ significantly.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:い-Adj-stem]くて (and)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「から」 and 「ので」 explicitly state a cause-and-effect relationship, the
  な-adjective + 「で」 form connects the adjective's quality directly to the following information. It often
  feels more like a descriptive link rather than a separate causal statement. The 「くて」 form, on the other
  hand, is simply the parallel structure used for い-adjectives, so focus on the different conjugation
  rules for each adjective type.
examples:
  - english: This room is quiet and comfortable.
    japanese:
      - この 部屋 は 静か で 快適 です。
      - この 部屋 は 静か で 快適 だ。
      - この 部屋 は 静か で 快適。
    english_literally: This room is quiet and comfortable.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 部屋 は 静か です。そして、快適 です。
        english: This room is quiet. And, it is comfortable.
        hint: Using 「そして」 separates the sentences more distinctly. We're looking for a smoother, more
          integrated connection between the two qualities.
    scene: You are describing a hotel room to a friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
  - english: He is serious and studies every day.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 真面目 で、毎日 勉強 し て い ます。
      - 彼 は 真面目 で、毎日 勉強 し て いる。
    english_literally: He is serious, and every day is studying.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 真面目 だ から、毎日 勉強 し て い ます。
        english: He is serious, so he studies every day.
        hint: 「から」 emphasizes the seriousness as a direct reason. Here, we're connecting two characteristics,
          'serious' and 'studying every day', rather than focusing on causality.
    scene: You are talking about a mutual friend to another friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「真面目 で」 connects the quality of being diligent to the action of studying every
      day, suggesting it's a natural consequence of his personality.
  - english: The information was accurate, so there were no misunderstandings.
    japanese:
      - 情報 は 正確 で、誤解 は あり ませ ん でし た。
      - 情報 は 正確 で、誤解 は 無かっ た。
    english_literally: Information was accurate, so misunderstandings were not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 情報 は 正確 だっ た の で、誤解 は あり ませ ん でし た。
        english: Because the information was accurate, there were no misunderstandings.
        hint: 「ので」 is a general connective for cause/reason. The 「で」 form directly links the adjective's
          state to the outcome. We're looking for the な-adjective's te-form.
    scene: You are explaining why a project went smoothly.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
  - english: The conversation was boring, so I got sleepy.
    japanese:
      - 会話 は 退屈 で、眠く なっ た。
      - 会話 は 退屈 で、すぐ 眠く なり まし た。
    english_literally: Conversation was boring, so got sleepy.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会話 が 退屈 だっ た の で、眠く なっ た。
        english: Because the conversation was boring, I got sleepy.
        hint: The grammar point is for な-adjectives followed by 「で」 to connect clauses. We're looking
          for that structure, not a separate causal clause.
    scene: You are recounting your day to a family member after a long day.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
  - english: This document is important, so please confirm it urgently.
    japanese:
      - この 資料 は 重要 で、早急 に ご 確認 ください。
      - この 資料 は 重要 で、早急 に 確認 し なさい。
    english_literally: This document is important, so urgently please confirm.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 資料 は 重要 です。だ から、早急 に ご 確認 ください。
        english: This document is important. Therefore, please confirm it urgently.
        hint: Using 「だから」 creates a stronger, more direct causal statement. The 「で」 form integrates the
          reason more smoothly.
    scene: A manager is giving instructions to their subordinate.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
  - english: I'm free today, what should I do?
    japanese:
      - 今日 は 暇 で、何 を しよう か な。
      - 今日 は 暇 で、何 を しよう かしら。
      - 今日 暇 で、何 しよう か な。
    english_literally: Today is free, what should I do, I wonder.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 暇 です。何 を しよう か な。
        english: Today I am free. I wonder what I should do.
        hint: Separating the sentences makes the connection less direct. We're looking for a single sentence
          where the state (free) leads to the thought (what to do).
    scene: You are talking to yourself or a close friend, contemplating your plans for the day.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
  - english: That dog is energetic and friendly.
    japanese:
      - その 犬 は 元気 で、優しい。
      - その 犬 は 元気 で、フレンドリー だ。
      - その 犬 は 元気 で、人 懐っこい。
    english_literally: That dog is energetic and friendly.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 犬 は 元気 だ し、優しい。
        english: That dog is energetic, and also friendly.
        hint: 「し」 is used for listing reasons or characteristics. We're connecting two descriptive adjectives
          smoothly with the te-form.
    scene: You are describing a pet to someone.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「元気 で」 (Genki de) connects the qualities of being energetic and friendly, presenting
      them as concurrent characteristics of the dog.
  - english: The problem is complex, so resolution is difficult.
    japanese:
      - 問題 は 複雑 で、解決 が 難しい。
      - 問題 は 複雑 で、解決 が 難しい です。
    english_literally: Problem is complex, so resolution is difficult.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 問題 は 複雑 だ。だ から、解決 が 難しい。
        english: The problem is complex. Therefore, resolution is difficult.
        hint: This uses a stronger, more explicit causal connector. The 「で」 form integrates the reason
          more fluidly within a single sentence structure.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a challenging project at work.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
  - english: The air is clean, so it feels very good.
    japanese:
      - 空気 が 綺麗 で、とても 気持ち が いい。
      - 空気 が 綺麗 で、とても 気持ち が いい です。
      - 空気 が 綺麗 で、すごく 気持ち いい。
    english_literally: Air is clean, so very good feeling is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 空気 が 綺麗 な の で、とても 気持ち が いい。
        english: Because the air is clean, it feels very good.
        hint: 「なので」 is a common way to express reason with な-adjectives. However, 「で」 offers a more direct
          and concise connection stemming from the adjective's quality.
    scene: You are enjoying a refreshing day outdoors.
    register: casual
    setting: optimistic
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
  - english: That shop is convenient, so I go there often, man.
    japanese:
      - あの 店 は 便利 で、よく 行く ぜ。
      - あの 店 は 便利 で、よく 行く よ。
      - あの 店 は 便利 で、よく 行く。
    english_literally: That shop is convenient, often go there, man.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 店 は 便利 だ から、よく 行く よ。
        english: That shop is convenient, so I go there often.
        hint: 「だから」 explicitly states the reason. The 「ぜ」 particle is a very masculine, informal ending.
          We are looking for the な-adjective te-form combined with casual masculine speech.
    scene: A young man is telling his friend about his favorite store.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The ending particle 「ぜ」 is a highly masculine and casual way to add emphasis or assertion
      to a statement, often used among close male friends. The use of 「便利 で」 links the convenience of
      the shop directly to the action of frequenting it.
  - english: That outfit is lovely, I want one too, dear.
    japanese:
      - その 服 は 素敵 で、私 も 欲しい わ。
      - その 服 は 素敵 で、私 も 欲しい な。
      - その 服 は 素敵 で、私 も 欲しい。
    english_literally: That outfit is lovely, I also want, dear.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 服 は 素敵 です。私 も 欲しい です。
        english: That outfit is lovely. I also want one.
        hint: Separating the sentences makes the connection less flowy. The 「わ」 particle is distinct to
          female speech. We are looking for the な-adjective te-form combined with casual feminine speech.
    scene: A young woman is admiring an outfit worn by her friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The sentence-final particle 「わ」 is commonly used by female speakers to express a soft assertion,
      emphasis, or emotion, making the statement sound more gentle or feminine. 「素敵 で」 links the adjective's
      quality to the desire.
post_example_writeup: 'The examples illustrate how な-Adjective + 「で」 can seamlessly connect clauses, whether
  to add descriptive information or to state a cause. Pay close attention to the base form of the adjective:
  if it ends in 「い」 (like 「可愛い」), it''s an い-adjective and will conjugate differently using 「くて」. If it
  takes 「な」 when modifying a noun (like 「静かな」), it''s a な-adjective and uses 「で」 for its te-form.'
