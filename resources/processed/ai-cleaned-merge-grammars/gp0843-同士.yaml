        "usage-context": "Standard",

        "source": "Bunpro, DOJG"
    },
    "etymology": "「同士 (どうし)」 is composed of two kanji: 「同 (どう)」 meaning \"same\" or \"similar,\" and 「士 (し)\" originally referring to a \"samurai\" or \"gentleman,\" but now broadly used to denote a person, professional, or member of a group. Combined, they form a term for people who share a common characteristic, status, or objective, hence conveying a sense of fellowship or mutuality.",
    "writeup": "「同士 (どうし)」 functions as a noun that can be used similarly to a suffix, conveying meanings such as 'fellow,' 'mutual,' or 'together.' It is typically affixed directly to a noun to denote a relationship or a shared attribute. The structure 「(Noun) + 同士 + の + (Noun)」 is also commonly employed, indicating that the second noun represents a collective form of the first, thereby emphasizing the shared characteristic. While 「同士」 is most frequently utilized to describe relationships among people or living beings, it can occasionally refer to inanimate objects, albeit less commonly. Its primary function is to highlight a shared type or relationship within a group.\n\nFor instance, 「友達同士 (tomodachi doushi)」 means 'friends with each other' or 'fellow friends', stressing the shared bond. This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts to express solidarity, a mutual connection, or an interaction specifically between members of the same category.",
