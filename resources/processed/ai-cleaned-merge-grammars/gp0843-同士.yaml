    "etymology": "「同士 (どうし)」 consists of two kanji: 「同 (どう)」 meaning \"same\" or \"similar,\" and 「士 (し)」 originally meaning \"samurai\" but now often used to denote a person, a professional, or a fellow member. Together, they create a term for people who share a common characteristic, status, or goal.",
    "writeup": "「同士 (どうし)」 is a noun that functions similarly to a suffix, signifying 'fellow,' 'mutual,' or 'together.' It's typically attached directly to a noun to indicate a relationship or shared attribute. The pattern 「(Noun) + 同士 + の + (Noun)」 is also common, expressing that the second noun is a grouped form of the first. While 「同士」 is most often used to describe relationships between people or living things, it can occasionally refer to inanimate objects. It emphasizes a shared type or relationship. For example, 「友達同士 (tomodachi doushi)」 means 'friends with each other' or 'fellow friends'.",
