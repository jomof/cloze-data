    "writeup": "「同士 (dōshi)」 literally means \"fellow.\" It is used to express that people or things share a mutual relationship, characteristic, or status. It can be attached directly to a noun to indicate 'mutual (A),' 'fellow (A),' or '(A) together.' 「Noun + 同士 + の + Noun」 is also common and indicates that noun (B) is a grouped form of noun (A). \n\nMost frequently, 「同士」 highlights shared relationships between people, but it can occasionally refer to inanimate objects. The kanji 「士」 (meaning \"gentleman\") provides a helpful reminder that it often involves people. 「同士」 emphasizes the mutuality, togetherness, or sameness between the nouns it connects.",
    "etymology": "The word 「同士」 is composed of two kanji: 「同 (dō)」 meaning \"same\" or \"similar,\" and 「士 (shi)」, which originally meant \"samurai\" but has come to refer to a person of shared status or profession. Together, they indicate individuals who share a common ground or relationship.",
