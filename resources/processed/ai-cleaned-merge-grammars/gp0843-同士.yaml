        "source": "Bunpro, DOJG"
    },
    "etymology": "「同士 (どうし)」 is composed of two kanji: 「同 (どう)」 meaning \"same\" or \"similar,\" and 「士 (し)\" originally referring to a \"samurai\" or \"gentleman,\" but now broadly used to denote a person, professional, or member of a group. Combined, they form a term for people who share a common characteristic, status, or objective, hence conveying a sense of fellowship or mutuality.",
    "writeup": "「同士 (どうし)」 functions as a noun that can be used similarly to a suffix, conveying meanings such as 'fellow,' 'mutual,' or 'together.' It is typically affixed directly to a noun to denote a relationship or a shared attribute. The structure 「(Noun) + 同士 + の + (Noun)」 is also commonly employed, indicating that the second noun represents a collective form of the first, thereby emphasizing the shared characteristic. While 「同士」 is most frequently utilized to describe relationships among people or living beings, it can occasionally refer to inanimate objects, albeit less commonly. Its primary function is to highlight a shared type or relationship within a group.\n\nFor instance, 「友達同士 (tomodachi doushi)」 means 'friends with each other' or 'fellow friends', stressing the shared bond. This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts to express solidarity, a mutual connection, or an interaction specifically between members of the same category.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「同士」, 「〜のうち(で)」 refers to selecting from a larger group rather than a mutual relationship or shared characteristic within a group. It focuses on inclusion or selection from a set of items or people, without implying active interaction or a common bond among them. For example, 「生徒のうちで」 (among the students) could mean selecting one student from a group, whereas 「生徒同士」 (among students) suggests interaction or shared traits.",

            "meaning": "In, Among, Within",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「同士」, 「のなかで」 indicates location or inclusion within a general group or space, not a shared trait or mutual action among specific members. It describes physical or abstract placement, rather than a reciprocal relationship or commonality between entities. For example, 「箱のなかで」 (inside the box) refers to location, while 「友達のなかで」 (among friends) could simply mean being physically surrounded by them, without implying a mutual action that 「友達同士」 would.",

In contrast, 「〜のうち(で)」 and 「のなかで」 primarily denote selection from or inclusion within a larger group or space. Therefore, use 「同士」 when the emphasis is on a common bond, mutual interaction, or shared characteristic, and opt for the other expressions when you need to specify a subset within a group or a location.",
