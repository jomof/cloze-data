        "[Verb] + 次第です": "Explains the reason or circumstances leading to a certain situation."
    },
    "jlpt": "N1",
    "meaning": "This is why; The circumstances are such that; Therefore (a situation arises)",
    "meaning_warning": "Avoid using 次第でございます since 次第 in this usage is already humble and でございます might make the phrase too polite, and some people may even take it as irony.",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "Used primarily in formal and polite speech, often with superiors or in business settings.",
        "function": "Explains the reason or circumstances for a particular situation.",
        "nuance": "Carries a humble and explanatory nuance, indicating that the situation is a consequence of preceding events."
    },
    "etymology": "「次第 (shidai)」 literally means \"order,\" \"sequence,\" or \"circumstances.\" The grammar point uses this meaning to explain the series of events or the specific reasons that led to the current situation. It often implies a formal or explanatory tone.",
    "writeup": "「次第です」 is a formal and polite expression used to explain the reason or circumstances that led to a particular situation or outcome. It conveys a nuance of \"This is how it came to be\" or \"This is the reason why.\" It functions as an auxiliary expression, typically following a verb, and is almost always used with です, reflecting its polite nature.\n\nThis pattern is particularly common in business correspondence, formal announcements, or when explaining a situation to a superior. It is used to present the current state or an action as a logical consequence of preceding events, often implying that the speaker's actions or the situation itself were unavoidable or the result of a chain of events.\n\nFor instance, when apologizing for being late, using 「遅れた次第です」 provides a more formal and comprehensive explanation than simply stating 「遅れました」 (I was late). It frames the lateness as a consequence of external circumstances, conveying a sense of humility and a detailed account.\n\nWhile 「次第でございます」 might seem like an even more polite option, it is generally advised against. 「次第」 in this usage already carries a humble connotation, and combining it with でございます can make the phrase sound overly polite or even ironic to some native speakers. Stick to 「次第です」 for appropriate politeness and formality.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene specifies explaining to a manager in an apologetic context, which requires a more formal and explanatory phrasing like 「次第です」 rather than the simpler 「遅れました」, to convey unavoidable circumstances and humility."
