    "etymology": "「次第」 originally refers to the order or sequence of things. In this grammatical context, it retains the sense of sequential reasoning, where a situation arises as a result of a preceding event or decision.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「次第です」 is used to provide a polite explanation or reason for a particular situation. It conveys that something has happened as a result of a specific sequence of events or decisions. It is similar to saying \"the eventuation is that (A)\", explaining how something ended up as (A). It commonly appears in polite speech and formal writing, often in business or professional contexts.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   While the grammar point includes both 「次第だ」 and 「次第です」, 「次第です」 is far more commonly used because it maintains a higher level of politeness.\n*   It is generally advised to avoid using 「次第でございます」, as the double layering of humble expressions can be perceived as excessive or even ironic.",
