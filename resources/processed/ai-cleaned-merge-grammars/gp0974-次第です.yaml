        "[Verb] + 次第です": "Explains the reason or circumstances leading to a certain situation."
    },
    "jlpt": "N1",
    "meaning": "Because the reason is, therefore, the present situation is like this, this is how (it is), those are the circumstances, this is why",
    "meaning_warning": "avoid using 次第でございます since 次第 in this usage is already humble and でございます might make the phrase too polite, and some people may even take it as irony",

    },
    "etymology": "「次第 (shidai)」 literally means \"order,\" \"sequence,\" or \"circumstances.\" The grammar point uses this meaning to explain the series of events or the specific reasons that led to the current situation. It often implies a formal or explanatory tone.",
    "writeup": "「次第です」 is used to politely explain the reason or circumstances for a particular situation. It's similar to saying \"the reason is...\" or \"this is how it is.\" It typically follows a verb and is often used in formal settings, such as business emails or when speaking to superiors.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   This grammar point is often used in business correspondence and formal speech.\n*   It carries a humble nuance, suitable for explaining situations to superiors or clients.\n*   While 「次第でございます」 is technically grammatically correct, it's often considered overly polite or even ironic. It is safer to simply use 「次第です」.",
