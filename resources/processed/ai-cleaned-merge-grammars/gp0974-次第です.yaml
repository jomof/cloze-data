        "[Verb] + 次第です": "Explains the reason or circumstances leading to a certain situation."
    },
    "jlpt": "N1",
    "meaning": "Because the reason is, therefore, the present situation is like this, this is how (it is), those are the circumstances, this is why",
    "meaning_warning": "avoid using 次第でございます since 次第 in this usage is already humble and でございます might make the phrase too polite, and some people may even take it as irony",

    },
    "etymology": "「次第 (shidai)」 literally means \"order,\" \"sequence,\" or \"circumstances.\" The grammar point uses this meaning to explain the series of events or the specific reasons that led to the current situation. It often implies a formal or explanatory tone.",
    "writeup": "「次第です」 is used to politely explain the reason or circumstances for a particular situation. It's similar to saying \"the reason is...\" or \"this is how it is.\" It typically follows a verb and is often used in formal settings, such as business emails or when speaking to superiors.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   This grammar point is often used in business correspondence and formal speech.\n*   It carries a humble nuance, suitable for explaining situations to superiors or clients.\n*   While 「次第でございます」 is technically grammatically correct, it's often considered overly polite or even ironic. It is safer to simply use 「次第です」.",

Reason: The grammar point `次第です` is a formal, context-dependent expression that does not inherently carry gendered language. The rule \"Use only if this sentence would typically only be spoken by this gender\" (for `speaker_gender` and `listener_gender`) and the implicit need for natural Japanese take precedence. This is in conflict with the rule \"Example sentences should include at least one male and one female speaker_gender\" and \"nuance **must** mention the specific Japanese, in 「quotes」, that would only be spoken by that gender.\" Satisfying the latter would require adding unnatural gendered elements to `次第です` examples, violating the \"natural and fluent\" overarching instruction.",
