jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: formal
  usage-context: Often used in polite language and formal speech, it indicates inclusiveness or universality.
  function: To indicate that something applies to all items/people in a given set, or neither/none when
    used with a negative predicate. It generalizes a statement across multiple options or members of a
    group.
etymology: The term いずれ (izure) derives from a formal adverb similar in meaning to 何 (nani - what), どう
  (dō - how), and どちら (dochira - which/where). The addition of the particle も (mo) expands its scope to
  signify 'any' or 'all of'. Historically, いずれは has been written with kanji such as 何れ or 孰れ, with 何れ
  being more common in modern usage.
writeup: |-
  いずれも (izuremo) is a formal adverb used to indicate that a statement applies to **all** items, individuals, or options within a specified set. In positive contexts, it translates to "all" or "both." When used with a negative predicate, it signifies "none" or "neither." For instance, if referring to two options, it means "both," but if referring to multiple options, it means "all."

  This grammar point is often encountered in formal settings, academic papers, and business communications due to its polite and precise nature. It functions by comprehensively applying a characteristic or action to every member of a group or every option presented.

  While often written in hiragana, いずれも can also be found in kanji as 何れ or, less commonly, 孰れ. The latter kanji form is typically found in older literature.

  It is important to distinguish いずれも from other fixed phrases that also use いずれ, such as いずれにしても, いずれにせよ, and いずれにしろ. These related expressions, while stemming from the same root, carry distinct meanings related to inevitability or certainty (e.g., "in any case," "at any rate") and are typically considered separate grammatical constructs.
false_friends:
  - term: いずれにしても
    meaning: In any case; anyway; at any rate
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While いずれも focuses on 'all' or 'both' (inclusiveness), いずれにしても expresses that a certain outcome
      or fact is true regardless of other factors or circumstances. It implies a conclusion or inevitability,
      focusing on the certainty of a situation rather than the scope of application.
    grammar_point: にせよ・にしろ (even if or no matter)
  - term: いずれにせよ
    meaning: In any event; at any rate; anyway
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to いずれにしても, いずれにせよ also conveys a sense of 'at any rate' or 'anyway', indicating that
      a certain result will occur or a statement holds true regardless of other conditions. It is slightly
      more formal than いずれにしても and is often used in writing or more formal speech.
    grammar_point: にせよ・にしろ (even if or no matter)
  - term: いずれにしろ
    meaning: Either way; in any case; anyway
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This phrase is also similar to いずれにしても and いずれにせよ, carrying the meaning of 'in any case' or
      'either way.' It is generally considered less formal than いずれにせよ and can often be used interchangeably
      with いずれにしても in casual contexts. Its nuance focuses on the certainty of a situation or outcome.
    grammar_point: にせよ・にしろ (even if or no matter)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'While いずれも (izuremo) emphasizes the universality or inclusiveness of a statement
  (applying to ''all'' or ''both'' items), the phrases いずれにしても, いずれにせよ, and いずれにしろ serve to express certainty
  or inevitability, meaning ''in any case'' or ''regardless of the circumstances.'' The key distinction
  lies in their function: いずれも describes the scope of application within a group, whereas the other phrases
  describe the certainty of a situation or outcome.'

      - competing_japanese:
          - 全て の 計画 書 が 素晴らしい 内容 だ。
        english: All the proposals are excellent.
        hint: While 「全ての」 also means 'all', 「いずれも」 emphasizes the common characteristic shared by each
          distinct proposal more formally. We're looking for a formal expression that emphasizes the universality
          of the quality.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 提案 は どれ も 素晴らしい 内容 だ。
        english: All the proposals are excellent.
        hint: 「どれも」 is general, but 「いずれも」 is more formal and emphasizes the shared quality among specific
          items. We're looking for a formal expression that emphasizes the universality of the quality.
    scene: A project manager is reviewing multiple new project proposals. The statement emphasizes that
      every single proposal is of high quality, implying that making a choice will be difficult because
      all are viable.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The phrase 「素晴らしい内容だ」 (subarashii naiyō da) is a formal way to express excellent content.
      The use of 「いずれも」 highlights that this positive assessment applies universally to all proposals,
      rather than just some, making the statement more comprehensive.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 姉妹 二人 とも 音楽 の 才能 が ある。
        english: Both sisters have musical talent.
        hint: 「二人とも」 directly translates to 'both of them', but 「いずれも」 has a slightly more elegant and
          inclusive nuance, suggesting that *each* individual possesses the talent, not just a simple
          count. We're looking for a specific, observed quality shared by both.
    scene: A person is casually discussing the talents within their family, specifically mentioning their
      siblings. The speaker wants to convey that this talent is shared by both, highlighting a common,
      observed quality.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The casual tone is indicated by the lack of formal endings. The use of 「いずれも」 here clearly
      indicates that *both* individuals possess the talent, emphasizing their shared ability, which might
      be particularly relevant if one usually only mentions one sibling.

          a formal and conclusive expression.
    scene: A detective is reporting to a superior about the interrogation of a suspect. The detective
      has found all statements made by the suspect to be unreliable and is emphasizing the complete lack
      of credibility.

    setting: serious
    nuance: The phrase 「信憑性がない」 (shinpyōsei ga nai) means 'lacks credibility' and is a formal, objective
      assessment. When combined with 「いずれも」, it emphatically states that *not a single one* of the testimonies
      holds up, conveying a strong and definitive sense of unreliability.

          rather than just a collective group. We're looking for an expression stressing individual responsibility.

        english: All attendees of the meeting, please read the materials beforehand.

          individual responsibility within a group.

          development. We're looking for a more refined and comprehensive expression.
    scene: A company spokesperson is giving a presentation to potential investors or customers, highlighting
      a key and consistent feature of their recently developed products across the entire line.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The phrasing 「環境に配慮されています」 (kankyō ni haiyo sarete imasu) means 'consideration for the environment
      has been given' and uses the passive voice to emphasize the quality rather than the agent. 「いずれも」

        hint: 「二人とも」 simply states 'both people'. 「いずれも」 emphasizes that *each* individual candidate possessed
          the skill, highlighting a shared strong attribute among distinct entities more formally. We're
          looking for a more formal and nuanced expression of shared attributes.

        english: Unfortunately, all my attempts to contact her were not successful.
        hint: 「全て〜なかった」 indicates a collective lack of success. 「いずれも〜なかった」 focuses on the individual
          failure of *each* attempt, providing a more detailed sense of futility. We're looking for an
          expression that conveys thorough failure across all individual attempts.

        english: All true artists have a unique vision.
        hint: 「皆」 (minna) means 'everyone' and is more colloquial. 「いずれも」 is a more formal and literary
          way to assert a universal characteristic or principle among a group. We're looking for a formal
          expression for a general truth.
    scene: An art critic or philosopher making a general statement about the nature of artistry.

    setting: instructional
    nuance: 「含んでいなければなりません」 (fukunde inakereba narimasen) signifies a strong obligation, 'must include'.
      「いずれも」 clarifies that *every single* submitted document must meet this requirement, leaving no ambiguity
      about the necessity of both items for each application.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, いずれも offers a precise way to state that a characteristic
  or action applies uniformly across a given set of items or individuals, whether positively indicating
  'all' or 'both,' or negatively indicating 'none' or 'neither.' Its formality makes it suitable for professional,
  academic, and serious contexts, providing a comprehensive and unambiguous statement.
