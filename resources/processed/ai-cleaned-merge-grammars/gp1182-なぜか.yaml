        "「なぜか」 + sentence": "Used as an adverb within a sentence or clause to express that the speaker or writer doesn't know the cause or reason for something."
    },
    "jlpt": "N2",
    "meaning": "For some reason; I don't know why",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "function": "Indicates that the speaker or writer is unsure of the cause or reason for a particular situation or phenomenon.",
        "nuance": "It conveys a sense of mystery or uncertainty surrounding an event or feeling.",
        "colocation": "Often precedes verbs or clauses, and can appear in various positions within a sentence, typically before the phenomenon it describes."
    },
    "etymology": "「なぜ」 (naze) means \"why,\" derived from 「何故」 (nan + yue, meaning \"what reason\"). The particle 「か」 (ka) typically functions as a question marker. However, in 「なぜか」, it does not form a direct question but rather expresses the speaker's contemplation or slight bewilderment regarding an unknown reason, effectively conveying \"I don't know why\" or \"for some reason.\"",
    "writeup": "「なぜか」 is an adverb used to express that the speaker or writer doesn't know the exact reason for something. It carries a nuance of mystery or perplexity, implying that while there might be a reason, it's not apparent to the speaker. It can be employed in a wide range of situations, from personal observations to describing broader phenomena, making it quite versatile. It's often used when an event or feeling occurs unexpectedly or without a clear, immediate cause. While it can be used in informal conversation, it tends to appear more frequently in written form or in slightly more formal spoken Japanese compared to expressions like 「どういうわけか」.",

The female speaker's reflection on an inexplicable positive feeling towards a male person adds to the intimate setting."
