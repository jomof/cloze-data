    "etymology": "「なぜ」 (naze) means \"why,\" derived from 「何故」 (nan + yue, meaning \"what reason\"). The particle 「か」 (ka) typically functions as a question marker. However, in 「なぜか」, it does not form a direct question but rather expresses the speaker's contemplation or slight bewilderment regarding an unknown reason, effectively conveying \"I don't know why\" or \"for some reason.\"",
    "writeup": "「なぜか」 is an adverb used to express that the speaker or writer doesn't know the exact reason for something. It carries a nuance of mystery or perplexity, implying that while there might be a reason, it's not apparent to the speaker. It can be employed in a wide range of situations, from personal observations to describing broader phenomena, making it quite versatile. It's often used when an event or feeling occurs unexpectedly or without a clear, immediate cause. While it can be used in informal conversation, it tends to appear more frequently in written form or in slightly more formal spoken Japanese compared to expressions like 「どういうわけか」.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「なぜか」, 「どうして」 functions as a direct interrogative, seeking a specific explanation or cause. It is primarily used when asking 'why?' or expressing a strong sense of 'how' or 'why' something occurred. 「なぜか」, on the other hand, expresses that the reason is unknown to the speaker, rather than seeking it directly from others, or that the speaker is simply perplexed by the lack of an obvious reason."

            "nuance": "While similar in conveying an absence of known reason, 「わけもなく」 emphasizes the *complete lack* of a reason, suggesting arbitrary action or circumstance. In contrast, 「なぜか」 implies that a reason *might exist*, but it is simply unknown or unclear to the speaker, carrying a nuance of mystery or perplexity rather than sheer randomness, making it suitable for situations where one feels a reason *should* exist but is obscure."

            "nuance": "This expression is very close to 「なぜか」. However, 「どういうわけか」 can sometimes imply a more deliberate search for a \"kind\" of reason or a slightly more formal/rhetorical tone, while 「なぜか」 is more common for expressing a simple, direct sense of inexplicable occurrence or feeling. It literally asks \"what kind of reason?\" or \"for what sort of reason,\" suggesting a slight analytical inclination even when a reason is unknown, whereas 「なぜか」 is a simpler expression of bewilderment."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「なぜか」, 「どうして」, 「わけもなく」, and 「どういうわけか」 all relate to reasons, they are used in distinct contexts. Use 「どうして」 when directly asking for an explanation. Use 「わけもなく」 when stating that there is absolutely no reason or cause for something. Use 「なぜか」 when the reason is unknown, yet you sense one might exist, or when expressing a puzzling, unexplainable occurrence. 「どういうわけか」 is similar to 「なぜか」 but can sometimes imply a more specific, albeit unknown, type of reason.",
