formation:
  毎 + [unit of time]: Indicates 'every' or 'per' a specific unit of time.

    or visits to a store, implying a regular recurrence.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: prefix
  usage-context: Used as a prefix to nouns indicating units of time or time-related concepts to express
    'every' or 'per'.
  nuance: Can only be attached to nouns that express a unit of time or a concept closely associated with
    time (e.g., meals, visits). It cannot be used with nouns that do not indicate a time or period of
    time.
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially, specifying the frequency of an action or event.
  logical-flow: Implies a consistent, habitual, or scheduled repetition.
  temporal-flow: Marks regular temporal intervals, creating a sense of continuous or scheduled recurrence.
etymology: 「毎」 (mai) itself means "every" or "each" in classical Chinese and Japanese. It is used to quantify
  or express repetition within a specific time frame or event. Its etymological root conveys a sense of
  recurrence, often linking to concepts of 'circulation' or 'each time'. This inherent meaning extends
  to its use as a prefix, indicating that the following noun occurs repeatedly.
writeup: 「毎」 (mai) is a prefix attached to nouns that represent units of time or concepts closely associated
  with time. It expresses the meaning of "every" or "per". For example, 「毎日」 (mainichi) means "every day,"
  and 「毎月」 (maitsuki) means "every month." Its application extends to concepts like meals (「毎食」 - maishoku,
  "every meal") or repeated visits (「毎度」 - maido, "every time/each time"), as these are fundamentally
  tied to temporal cycles or occurrences. It's essential to remember that 「毎」 can only be used with nouns
  directly or conceptually related to time. For example, you can say 「毎食」 (maishoku) because meals are
  associated with time. However, it cannot be used with general nouns like 「人」 (hito, person) to mean
  'every person'; instead, expressions like 「すべての人」 (subete no hito) or 「みんな」 (minna) are used. Similarly,
  「毎先生」 (mai sensei, every teacher) or 「毎家」 (mai ie, every house) are incorrect, as these nouns do not
  inherently convey a unit or concept of time.

  - term: ごとに
    meaning: every time; each time; for each; per
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「毎」 is a prefix that combines with a noun to form a single lexical unit, often implying a
      regular, continuous occurrence or schedule (e.g., 「毎日」 'every day'). In contrast, 「ごとに」 is a suffix
      that attaches to nouns (often time-related) or dictionary forms of verbs. It emphasizes each individual
      instance or interval within a series, highlighting distinct, discrete occurrences rather than a
      continuous flow. For example, 「三時間ごとに」 (sanjikan-goto ni) means 'every three hours,' focusing on
      each individual three-hour block, whereas 「毎時間」 (maijikan) implies 'every hour,' implying a continuous
      hourly rhythm.
    grammar_point: ごとに (each・every)
  - term: 毎回
    meaning: every time, each time
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「毎」 forms a compound with specific time units (e.g., 毎日, 毎週, 毎月), emphasizing habitual, continuous
      recurrence. 「毎回」 (maikai) is a standalone word meaning "every time" or "each instance," focusing
      on individual occurrences of an event or action rather than a period of time. It can be used more
      broadly for non-time-specific repetitions.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:毎回 (every time)
  - term: たびに
    meaning: every time, each time, whenever
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～たび (に)」 signifies "each occasion" or "whenever," often implying a conditional relationship
      where something happens every time a specific event occurs. It focuses on discrete events rather
      than a continuous, regular period. 「毎」 typically implies a fixed, regular rhythm over a period of
      time.
    grammar_point: たびに (each time)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「毎」 and 「ごとに」 can express concepts of repetition, their nuances
  differ subtly. 「毎」 suggests a more generalized, continuous, or habitual recurrence, often forming a
  single, common compound word (like 「毎日」 'every day'). 「ごとに」, however, isolates and emphasizes each instance
  or interval within a series, highlighting distinct, discrete occurrences. For example, 「五分ごとに水を飲む」 (gofun-goto
  ni mizu o nomu) would mean 'drinking water every five minutes,' emphasizing distinct five-minute intervals,
  whereas 「毎分水を飲む」 (maifun mizu o nomu) implies drinking water continuously minute by minute. 「毎回」 (maikai)
  also means 'every time' or 'each time', but it functions as a standalone word, often referring to every
  single instance or occasion of an event or action, rather than forming a compound with a time unit.
  For instance, 「毎回テスト」 (maikai tesuto) means 'every test' (each instance of a test), while 「毎月テスト」 (maitsuki
  tesuto) means 'monthly tests.' Furthermore, 「～たび (に)」 (～tabi ni) conveys 'each occasion' or 'whenever,'
  often implying a conditional relationship where something happens every time a specific event occurs.
  It focuses on individual events, emphasizing what happens on each occasion of something else occurring.
  For example, 「旅行のたびに新しい発見がある」 (ryokō no tabi ni atarashii hakken ga aru) means 'every time I travel,
  there are new discoveries.' This is distinct from 「毎」 which typically describes a fixed, regular rhythm
  over a period of time.

          that week. We're looking for 'every week'.
    scene: Two colleagues discussing a mutual acquaintance's weekly habits.
    register: teineigo (polite)

      their teacher. 「毎週」 (maishuu) refers to the regular weekly occurrence of the class.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the precise nuance of each 'every' expression is key to natural Japanese.
  While 「毎」 is excellent for simple, consistent time-based repetition, consider 「ごとに」 when emphasizing
  distinct intervals, and 「毎回」 or 「～たび (に)」 for individual occurrences or conditional repetitions of events.
