        "usage-context": "Used in situations where someone employs a superficial reason or a misleading pretext to justify an action that serves a different, often ulterior, motive. It carries a strong nuance of skepticism and implied criticism from the speaker.",

    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にかこつけて」 is derived from the Ichidan verb 「託ける (kakotsukeru)」, which means \"to use as a pretext\" or \"to make an excuse.\" The particle 「に」 indicates the reason or basis for the action. Thus, 「にかこつけて」 literally means \"attaching to\" or \"relying on\" something as an excuse, often for a hidden agenda. The te-form 「託けて」 signifies a continuous action or state, emphasizing the ongoing use of the excuse.",
    "writeup": "「にかこつけて」 is a versatile expression used to describe situations where someone employs a superficial reason or a misleading pretext to justify an action that serves a different, often ulterior, motive. It carries a strong nuance of skepticism and implied criticism from the speaker, suggesting that the stated purpose is merely a facade for a hidden agenda. This grammar point highlights the speaker's awareness of the discrepancy between the stated reason and the true intent.\n\nIt is commonly translated as \"using the excuse of,\" \"under the pretense of,\" or \"under the guise of.\" The construction typically involves a noun or a nominalized verb/adjective followed by 「に」, indicating the supposed reason, and then 「かこつけて」.\n\n**Usage Context:**\n*   Often used when the speaker suspects manipulation or a lack of sincerity. The tone can range from mildly humorous to severely critical, depending on the context and the nature of the hidden motive.\n*   It implies a calculated or opportunistic use of an excuse.\n*   While grammatically flexible, its inherent nuance often makes it more common in informal or semi-formal settings where personal opinions and judgments are expressed.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「にかこつけて」, 「を口実にして」, 「をだしにして」, and 「と称して」 all convey the idea of using an excuse or pretext, their subtle differences are crucial. 「にかこつけて」 often reflects the speaker's skepticism, implying a subtle, often self-serving, hidden motive. 「を口実にして」 is quite close in meaning but can be used in slightly more neutral or formal contexts. 「をだしにして」 carries a stronger negative connotation, suggesting that something or someone is being exploited as a mere tool. 「と称して」 is typically more formal and used when a stated purpose is clearly a misrepresentation, often in public or official discourse. In stark contrast, 「のために」 is used for a genuine, transparent purpose, with no hidden agenda involved.",
