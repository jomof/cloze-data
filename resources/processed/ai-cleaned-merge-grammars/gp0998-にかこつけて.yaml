    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にかこつけて」 is derived from 「に」 (a case-marking particle) and 「託ける」 (kakotsukeru), which means \"to consign as\" or \"to label as\". Thus, it carries the nuance of using something as a label or pretext for another purpose.",
    "writeup": "「にかこつけて」 is based on the particle 「に」 and the verb 「託ける」 (to consign, to label as). Although often translated as \"in the name of\" or \"under the pretense of\", it's important to remember the original meaning of 「託ける」, which is \"to consign\". Therefore, 「にかこつけて」 can also mean \"labeling it as (A)\". This grammar point is often used to express criticism of superficial excuses used to conceal an ulterior motive. It's used after nouns or verbs nominalized with 「の」.",
