        "usage-context": "Used to express a sense of frustration or unmet expectation regarding something that is not happening or is not progressing as desired or anticipated.",
        "function": "Modifies a negative verb or adjective to emphasize difficulty, slowness, or an unexpected lack of progress.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the speaker expects a different, more positive outcome, and the current state causes a feeling of mild frustration or impatience. It is stronger than 'あまり〜ない' (not very) but less absolute than '全く〜ない' (not at all). It often suggests an internal obstacle or persistence required.",
        "grammatical-role": "Adverbial modifier"
    },
    "etymology": "The word なかなか (中々) literally means 'in the middle' or 'amidst'. When used with a negative verb, it colloquially evolved to convey a sense that something isn't reaching its expected or desired 'middle ground' or optimal state, thereby expressing difficulty, resistance, or a prolonged state of not achieving something. This historical nuance lends itself to the feeling of unmet expectation or frustration that accompanies its use.",
    "writeup": "「なかなか〜ない」 is a common Japanese expression used to convey that something is **not easily** achieved, is **hardly** happening, or is **far from** reaching an expected state. It implies a sense of difficulty, resistance, or a prolonged period without the desired outcome. Unlike a simple negation, it carries a nuance of the speaker's expectation being unmet, often leading to a feeling of frustration or impatience. This expression is versatile and can be applied to actions, states, or processes.\n\n### Usage\n\n「なかなか」 is typically placed directly before the negative form of a verb or an い-adjective. For example, in 「なかなか できない」 (It's not easily done), the frustration arises because one expects it *should* be done, but it isn't.\n\nWhile 「なかなか」 can also be used in a positive sense to mean \"very\" or \"quite\" (e.g., 「なかなか 面白い」 - It's quite interesting), its usage with negation is distinctly different, highlighting the difficulty or lack of progress. The context always clarifies which meaning is intended.\n\nIt is generally used in standard or casual speech, reflecting a personal observation or complaint about a persistent situation.",

            "nuance": "Similar to 「全然〜ない」, 「少しも〜ない」 indicates that there's not even a small degree of something, emphasizing completeness of negation. 「なかなか〜ない」, conversely, focuses on the struggle or difficulty of achieving something.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「めったに〜ない」 focuses specifically on the infrequency of an event. While it implies that something doesn't happen easily due to rarity, it doesn't necessarily carry the same nuance of personal effort, expectation, or frustration that 「なかなか〜ない」 does regarding a continuous state or process.",

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While several expressions convey negativity, 「なかなか〜ない」 is distinct in its emphasis on difficulty and unmet expectation. It's not merely stating that something isn't happening; it's highlighting that despite implicit or explicit effort, or a reasonable expectation, the desired outcome is not materializing easily. This nuance of mild frustration or impatience is central to its usage, differentiating it from more absolute or purely frequency-based negative expressions.",

            "nuance": "The use of 「〜ね」 softens the statement, making it a shared observation rather than a direct complaint. The speaker's female gender doesn't inherently change the verb form here, but the overall casual tone fits female speech patterns. Speaking to a male friend with this casualness is also natural for females, especially when discussing a shared slight inconvenience or observation. The choice of 「来ない」 vs. 「来ません」 depends on the desired level of politeness within the casual register; here, both are provided to show common variations in spoken Japanese."
