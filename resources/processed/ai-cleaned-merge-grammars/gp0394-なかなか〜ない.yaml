    "etymology": "The word 「なかなか」 originally meant \"amidst\" or \"in the middle\" (中々). When used with a negative verb, it suggests that something is not happening as smoothly or readily as it should, or not reaching an optimal state. It conveys a sense of frustration or unmet expectation.",
    "writeup": "「なかなか〜ない」 is used to express that something is **not easily** done or doesn't happen as expected. It often highlights a situation where the speaker anticipates a certain outcome, but it's not materializing. It implies a sense of disappointment or frustration. なかなか is placed before the negative verb or adjective. It is similar to 「ぜんぜん〜ない」 or 「あまり〜ない」, but carries a slightly stronger sense of unmet expectation.",
