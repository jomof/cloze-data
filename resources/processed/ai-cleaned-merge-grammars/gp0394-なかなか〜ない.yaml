    "etymology": "The word 「なかなか」originally meant 'in the middle' or 'sort of'. When used with a negative verb, it creates a nuance that something is not happening as expected or is not in the desired state, implying it's far from the 'middle ground' or optimal condition.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「なかなか〜ない」 means \"not easily\", \"hardly\", or \"not at all\". It expresses the speaker's expectation that something should happen, but it doesn't occur readily. 「なかなか」is placed at the beginning of the phrase or directly before the negative verb. It often conveys a sense of frustration or mild disappointment. For example, 「なかなか寝ない」 means \"not easily falling asleep\", implying a struggle or difficulty in getting to sleep. Be careful to note that 「なかなか」 on its own can have the opposite meaning (as noted in the false friends section.)",

            "etymology": "風邪「かぜ」means 'cold'. 治らない「なおらない」is the negative form of the verb to heal."
