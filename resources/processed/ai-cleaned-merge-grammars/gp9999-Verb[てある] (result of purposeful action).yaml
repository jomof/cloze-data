pronunciation:
  katakana: テアル
  romaji: tearu
formation:
  Transitive Verb て-form + ある: Indicates a state resulting from a purposeful action on an inanimate object.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The 『て』 form acts as a conjunctive, connecting the preceding verb to 『ある』, which signifies
  the existence of an inanimate object. This combination inherently suggests a state of something being
  in existence due to a preceding action, with 『ある』 explicitly indicating the inanimate nature of the
  subject in its resultant state.
writeup: |-
  『Verb[てある]』 is a grammar pattern used to describe a state that has resulted from a deliberate, purposeful action. It often implies that someone has performed an action to prepare something or arrange it in a certain way. The focus is on the **resultant state** of the object rather than the action itself or the actor.

  **Key distinctions:**
  - **Purposeful Action:** The action leading to the state is almost always done with intention. For example, ドアが{開けてあります} (The door has been opened [by someone for a purpose]), implies someone opened it intentionally, perhaps for ventilation or for someone to enter.
  - **Transitive Verbs:** 『Verb[てある]』 typically follows the 『て-form』 of transitive verbs (verbs that take a direct object).
  - **Inanimate Subject:** The subject of the 『てある』 sentence is usually inanimate, as it is the object that is in a certain state.
  - **Emphasis on State:** While 『Verb[ている]』 can also describe a resultant state (e.g., ドアが{開いている} - The door is open), 『Verb[てある]』 specifically emphasizes that this state is the *result of a purposeful action*. 『開いている』 could mean the door is open naturally or accidentally, but 『開けてある』 strongly suggests someone opened it on purpose.

  - term: Verb[ている] (ongoing state・resultant state)
    meaning: an ongoing action or a state that has resulted from an action
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 『Verb[ている]』 can describe a resultant state without implying a purposeful action (e.g., 窓が{割れている}
      - The window is broken, could be accidental). 『Verb[てある]』 *always* implies a purposeful action.
    grammar_point: Verb[ている・てる] (progressive・resultative)
  - term: Verb[ておく・とく] (preparation・advance action)
    meaning: to do something in advance or leave something in a certain state
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『Verb[ておく]』 emphasizes the *action of preparing* for a future event (e.g., 窓を{開けておく} - I'll
      open the window [in advance]). 『Verb[てある]』 emphasizes the *state* resulting from that preparation
      (e.g., 窓が{開けてある} - The window *is* open [because someone opened it]). The 『てある』 form is usually
      passive, describing the state of the object, while 『ておく』 is active.
    grammar_point: Verb[ておく・とく] (preparation・advance action)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'The main difference between 『Verb[てある]』 and 『Verb[ている]』 when describing a
  resultant state lies in the presence of intent. If an object is in a certain state because someone intentionally
  put it that way, use 『てある』. If the state is simply observed, or occurred naturally/accidentally, 『ている』
  is more appropriate. For example, a window could be 『開いている』 (just open), but if it was opened by someone
  to let air in, it is 『開けてある』. The distinction between 『てある』 and 『ておく』 is one of focus: 『ておく』 focuses
  on the *action* of preparation, while 『てある』 focuses on the *state* that *resulted* from that preparation.
  Think of 『ておく』 as “to do and leave” and 『てある』 as “it has been done and is left [in that state]”.'
