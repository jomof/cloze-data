    },
    "etymology": "The character 側 (ソク, gawa) originally depicted a person standing next to a wall, signifying \"side\" or \"flank.\" It inherently carries the meaning of being adjacent to or a specific face of something. This explains its use in expressions like 右側 (right side) or 左側 (left side), where it denotes a defined boundary or surface of an object or space. Over time, its usage extended to broader spatial and even abstract \"sides\" or \"parties.\"",
    "writeup": "側 (がわ), pronounced \"gawa,\" is a versatile noun and suffix used to indicate a \"side\" or \"flank.\" When used independently, it can refer to a general side, as in 両側 (りょうがわ, both sides). More commonly, it is affixed to a direction, like 右 (みぎ, right) or 左 (ひだり, left), to form 右側 (みぎがわ, right side) and 左側 (ひだりがわ, left side). It can also attach to other nouns to specify a particular side, such as 窓側 (まどがわ, window side) or 駅側 (えきがわ, station side).\nThe core nuance of 側 is to designate a **specific face, plane, or region** of an object or area. This differentiates it from simply stating 右 or 左, which indicate direction or general location without emphasizing the \"side\" as a distinct boundary. For instance, 右にあります (It's on the right) is a general location, whereas 右側にあります (It's on the right side) points to a particular face or section.\n側 is widely used in everyday conversation and formal settings, making it an essential component for precise spatial descriptions. It is grammatically neutral and can be used by speakers of all genders and ages.",

The sixth option, カフェ は 駅 の 左側 に ある, is a neutral plain form, suitable for describing facts informally. The seventh option, カフェ は 駅 の 左側 だ, is also a plain form, often used for more direct, declarative statements in casual conversation. The eighth option, 駅 の 左側 に カフェ が ある, places more emphasis on the existence of the cafe on that side, while the ninth option, 駅 の 左側 に カフェ が あり ます, is its polite counterpart, maintaining the emphasis on location. The colloquial あんじゃん in 駅 の 左側 に カフェ あんじゃん is common among younger male speakers, expressing surprise or confirmation. 駅 の 左側 でございます is a very polite and formal way to state location, often used in customer service. 駅 の 左側 に カフェ が ある わ よ adds the feminine particle わ and the assertive よ, making it friendly and slightly emphatic, common for female speakers. 駅 の 左側 に カフェ が あり ます から ね provides an explanatory or confirming tone, often used when guiding someone. 駅 の 左側 に カフェ が ござい まし て is a formal and continuous phrase, often used to introduce further description."
