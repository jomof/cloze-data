jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: expresses cessation of an action, habit, or state.
  nuance: Can imply a decision to stop, or simply the act of stopping. Can be voluntary or involuntary
    depending on context.
etymology: The verb やめる (yameru) derives from the classical Japanese verb 止む (yamu), which means "to stop"
  or "to cease" (intransitive). The transition to やめる (transitive) signifies a shift from an action ceasing
  by itself to an action being actively stopped or brought to an end by an agent. This reflects the evolution
  of the language to distinguish between an action naturally stopping and someone intentionally making
  it stop.
writeup: '{やめる} is a fundamental Japanese verb primarily meaning "to stop," "to quit," or "to cease."
  It is a transitive verb, meaning it typically takes a direct object marked by the particle を (o), indicating
  what is being stopped or quit. This makes it distinct from its intransitive counterpart, 止む (yamu),
  which refers to something stopping on its own (e.g., 雨が止む - Ame ga yamu, "The rain stops"). Commonly,
  {やめる} is used to describe stopping an ongoing action, a habit, or a job. For example, 煙草を{やめる} (tabako
  o yameru) means "to quit smoking," and 会社を{やめる} (kaisha o yameru) means "to quit a company/job." It
  can also refer to ceasing an activity, such as 勉強を{やめる} (benkyou o yameru - "to stop studying"). The
  decision to stop is usually voluntary, but context can sometimes imply an involuntary cessation if the
  subject is external to the action. Understanding the distinction between transitive {やめる} and intransitive
  止む is crucial for accurate usage.'
false_friends:
  - term: 止む (yamu)
    meaning: To stop, to cease (intransitive)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 止む (yamu) refers to something stopping *on its own*, like rain or wind. {やめる} is used when
      *someone* actively stops something. For example, 雨が止む (ame ga yamu) means "the rain stops," while
      喫煙を{やめる} (kitsuen o yameru) means "I quit smoking."
    grammar_point: 止む (to stop・intransitive)
  - term: 中止する
    meaning: To cancel, to suspend, to discontinue
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 中止する (chuushi suru) often implies a formal or planned cancellation of an event or project,
      usually by an authority or group decision. {やめる} is more general and can refer to an individual's
      decision to stop.
    grammar_point: 中止する (to cancel)
  - term: 終える
    meaning: To finish, to complete (transitive)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 終える (oeru) emphasizes the completion of a task or process, implying a natural end. {やめる} focuses
      on the act of *stopping*, which might not necessarily mean completion, or it could imply discontinuation.
      You might {やめる} a task halfway, but you 終える it when it's done.
    grammar_point: 終える (to finish・transitive)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between {やめる} and similar expressions, consider the intention
  and outcome. While 止む refers to an action ceasing naturally, {やめる} implies an active decision to halt
  something. 中止する suggests a formal cancellation, and 終える points to the completion of an action. Choose
  {やめる} when the nuance is about an active discontinuation of an action, habit, or involvement.
examples:
  - english: I decided to quit my job.
    japanese:
      - 仕事 を {やめ まし た}。
      - 仕事 を {やめ た}。
      - 仕事 を {やめる} こと に し まし た。
    english_literally: As for job, I stopped it.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 仕事 が {終わり まし た}。
        english: My work has finished.
        hint: 「終わる」 means to finish naturally. Here, the speaker made a conscious decision to stop their
          job. We're looking for an active decision to cease.
    scene: Talking to a friend over coffee about recent life changes.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: This is a straightforward use of {やめる} for quitting a job. 「仕事 を {やめました}」 is a common way
      to express this decision. The plain form 「やめた」 or the phrase 「やめる こと に しました」 emphasizing the decision,
      can also be used.
  - english: Please don't stop studying Japanese.
    japanese:

      - 日本 語 の 勉強 を {やめ ない で}。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 語 の 勉強 を {続け ましょう}。
        english: Let's continue studying Japanese.
        hint: While this conveys the same sentiment, we're looking for a direct request *not* to stop,
          using the negative form of the grammar point.
    scene: A teacher encouraging a student who is feeling discouraged.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The negative 「{やめないで}」 is used here as a request not to cease an action. The phrase 「勉強 を
      {やめないで} ください」 emphasizes continuation rather than cessation. The plain 「やめないで」 is more casual.
  - english: I stopped smoking last year.
    japanese:
      - 去年、タバコ を {やめ た}。
      - 去年、タバコ を {やめ まし た}。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 去年、タバコ を {禁煙 し た}。
        english: Last year, I gave up smoking (formally).
        hint: 「禁煙する」 implies a more formal or official act of abstaining from smoking. We're looking for
          a general statement about quitting a habit using the more common verb.
    scene: Talking with a peer about health improvements.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: This shows {やめる} used for quitting a habit. 「タバコ を {やめた}」 is a very common and direct expression
      in casual conversation. Adding 「やめました」 makes it polite.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 言い訳 を {する な}！
        english: Don't make excuses!
        hint: This is a prohibitive command. We're looking for a direct imperative using the target verb,
          telling someone to stop the action of making excuses.
    scene: A parent scolding a child.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male

    nuance: The plain imperative 「{やめろ}」 is a very strong and direct command, typically used by someone
      in a position of authority towards someone subordinate, or in a very casual, frustrated tone among
      close friends. 「やめなさい」 is a slightly softer but still firm polite imperative. 「やめてください」 is a polite
      request.

    setting: intimate

    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 'The te-form 「{やめて}」 connects the act of stopping to a subsequent action, implying a sequence:
      "stop X, and then let''s do Y." 「帰りましょう」 is polite volitional, while 「帰ろう」 is plain volitional.'
  - english: Even if I stop eating sweets, I probably won't lose weight.
    japanese:
      - 甘い 物 を {やめ て も}、多分 痩せ ない でしょう。
      - 甘い 物 を {やめ て も}、多分 痩せ ない だろう。

        english: Even if I cut back on sweets, I probably won't lose weight.

    scene: Self-deprecating comment to a family member about dieting.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    conjugation: concessive (～ても)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「{やめても}」 expresses a concession, indicating that even if the action of stopping sweets occurs,
      the expected positive outcome (losing weight) is unlikely. 「でしょう」 is polite conjecture, 「だろう」 is
      plain conjecture.
  - english: I was forced to quit the club activities.

      - 部活 を {やめ させ られ た}。
      - 部活 を {やめ させ られ まし た}。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 部活 を {諦め させ られ た}。
        english: I was made to give up on club activities.
        hint: 「諦めさせられた」 implies being forced to abandon hope or give up on something internally. We're
          looking for being forced to physically cease participation.
    scene: Complaining to a friend about a situation.
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    conjugation: causative-passive (～させられる)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「{やめさせられた}」 is the causative-passive form, meaning "was made to quit" or "was forced to quit,"
      highlighting an involuntary action. This construction is common when expressing something negative
      imposed by an external party. 「やめさせられました」 is the polite form.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate the versatility of {やめる} across various contexts and conjugations.
  Notice how the choice of conjugation, such as casual vs. polite, or active vs. passive, changes the
  nuance of who is performing the action or experiencing the cessation. Pay close attention to the object
  marked by を, as it clarifies what exactly is being stopped or quit.
