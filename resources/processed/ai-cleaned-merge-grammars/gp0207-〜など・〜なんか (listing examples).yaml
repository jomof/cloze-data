details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: casual
  particle-pragmatic-function: emphasis
  usage-context: Listing examples; など is generally neutral or slightly formal. なんか is casual and can imply
    a slight downplaying or dismissal of the listed items.
  function: Exemplification, with なんか also conveying emphasis or a casual, downplaying tone.
  nuance: など is a general enumerator, meaning 'and so on' or 'etc.'. It can also be used to show humility
    or vague reference. なんか is an informal variation that can carry a stronger emotional tone, often implying
    a casualness or slight downplaying of the listed items.
etymology: The particle など is thought to derive from classical Japanese, combining な (indicating name
  or kind) and ど (a particle indicating place or extent). This historical origin helps explain its core
  function of indicating 'things of that kind' or 'examples among others'. The more colloquial form なんか
  evolved from など, likely through phonetic shifts and the addition of emphatic elements, allowing for
  the expression of stronger subjective feelings like disdain or downplaying, which are not inherent in
  the more neutral など.
writeup: 'The grammar point 「など・なんか」 is used to indicate examples or to express a list of items, often
  implying “such as,” “things like,” or “and so on.” While they all share this basic function, their nuances
  and specific emotional connotations differ. **など (nado)**: This is the most neutral and widely applicable
  form. It can be used in both formal and casual contexts. When used to list examples, it implies that
  the list is not exhaustive and there are other similar items. It can also be used to downplay the importance
  of something or to express humility, suggesting ''something trivial like X''. **なんか (nanka)**: This
  is a casual and more colloquial variant, primarily used in spoken Japanese. When used for listing examples,
  it can carry a nuance of dismissiveness, slight contempt, or downplaying of the listed items. For example,
  if someone says 「ゲームなんか嫌いだよ」, it implies ''I dislike trivial things like games''. It can also simply
  be a casual, slightly vague way to give examples without strong negative connotation, similar to ''or
  something'' in English.'
false_friends:
  - term: や (non-exhaustive list)
    meaning: To list a few items out of many; 'and so on.'
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: や simply lists examples without adding any particular nuance of dismissiveness or downplaying,
      unlike など and なんか. It's a neutral way to give a few examples.
    grammar_point: や (non-exhaustive list)
  - term: とか (hearsay)
    meaning: Listing examples casually; expressing uncertainty or hearsay; 'things like... or something.'
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: とか is similar to なんか in its casual listing function. However, とか can also express hearsay
      or uncertainty, a function not typically associated with など or なんか when listing examples. とか is
      also more strictly for *listing* examples, while なんか can be used for general downplaying without
      a list.
    grammar_point: とか (hearsay)
  - term: をはじめ (starting with)
    meaning: Starting with; not only...but also... (implies a representative example followed by others
      of similar importance)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: をはじめ specifically highlights a primary example, suggesting that other similar items or people
      follow. It implies the listed item is significant or representative, while など and なんか can be used
      for less important or even trivial examples, especially when downplaying.
    grammar_point: をはじめ (starting with)
  - term: はもとより (not only... but also)
    meaning: Not only... but also; let alone; not to mention.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: はもちろん emphasizes that something is obvious or natural, and then extends that to other items,
      often implying 'even more so' for the subsequent items. It sets a baseline of what is already known
      or given, unlike など which can introduce examples without such a baseline.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:はもとより (not only・but also)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between など and なんか and similar expressions, consider the
  speaker's intent beyond just listing. While や and とか also list examples, や is neutral, and とか can imply
  uncertainty or hearsay. など is generally neutral or used for vague reference, while なんか can add a casual
  or slightly dismissive nuance to the listed items. Expressions like をはじめ and はもちろん, on the other hand,
  highlight a main example and then extend the scope, often implying importance or obviousness, which
  contrasts with the potentially downplaying tone of なんか.

  - english: I like reading books and watching movies, among other things.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 本 を 読ん だり、映画 を 見 たり {など} が 好き です。
      - 本 を 読ん だり、映画 を 見 たり {など} する の が 好き です。
      - 本 を 読ん だり、映画 を 見 たり {など} する の が 好き。

        english: I do things like reading books and watching movies.
        hint: This simply lists activities without specifying 'and so on'. We're looking for a way to
          imply a non-exhaustive list of hobbies.
    scene: A person is describing their hobbies to a new acquaintance in a friendly conversation.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
  - english: I don't eat vegetables like carrots.
    japanese:
      - 人参 {なん か} 食べ ない よ。
      - 人参 {なん か} 食べ ない。
      - 人参 {など} 食べ ない。
    english_literally: I don't eat trivial things like carrots.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 人参 は 食べ ない よ。
        english: I don't eat carrots.
        hint: This is a simple statement of dislike. We're looking for a nuance of disdain or dismissiveness
          towards carrots.
    scene: A child is refusing to eat their dinner, showing a strong dislike for a particular vegetable.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「なんか」 (nanka) here expresses the speaker's disdain or strong dislike for carrots,
      making them seem trivial or undesirable, which aligns with 'downplaying the listed items'. This
      is a common nuance for children.
  - english: I don't understand things like politics.
    japanese:
      - 政治 {など} は よく 分かり ませ ん。
      - 政治 {なん か}、よく 分かり ませ ん。
      - 政治 {など} は よく 分から ない。
      - 政治 {なん か}、よく 分から ない。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 政治 は よく 分かり ませ ん。
        english: I don't understand politics.
        hint: This is a direct statement. We're looking for a way to politely generalize one's lack of
          understanding about a broader category of topics.
    scene: An individual is asked about their opinion on current political events and expresses a lack
      of knowledge or interest in a polite manner.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Using 「など」 (nado) here in a polite context helps to soften the statement, implying 'topics
      like politics' or 'and so on with similar complex subjects'. It's a way to vaguely refer to a category
      without sounding too abrupt about one's disinterest, maintaining politeness in the phrase 「よく分かりません」.
  - english: He doesn't do things like cooking or cleaning.

          mild disapproval or dismissiveness about his lack of participation in these chores.
    scene: Two friends gossiping about a mutual acquaintance who is lazy around the house.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The repeated use of 「なんか」 (nanka) emphasizes the speaker's mild disapproval or exasperation
      regarding the man's unwillingness to do household chores, presenting these activities as 'trivial'
      or 'unbothered by' for him. It adds a slight dismissive tone from the speaker's perspective to the
      listed items.
  - english: I never thought I'd get married, but here I am.
    japanese:
      - 結婚 {など} し ない と 思っ て い た が、まさか 自分 が する と は。

      - 結婚 {など} し ない と 思っ て た けど、まさか 自分 が する と は ね。
      - 結婚 {なん か} し ない と 思っ て た けど、まさか 自分 が する と は ね。

      it.

        english: I thought I wouldn't get married, but unexpectedly, I myself am doing it.
        hint: This statement is direct. We're looking for a past mindset that viewed marriage as one among
          many 'such things' to avoid.
    scene: A person reflecting on their life choices, surprised by how things turned out, speaking to
      a close friend.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: Here, 「など」 (nado) is used to express that marriage was one of those 'things' the speaker thought
      they would never do, perhaps viewing it as a conventional or restrictive path they didn't foresee
      for themselves. It adds a nuanced sense of distance or mild disinterest to the concept of marriage
      in their past thoughts.
  - english: I'm worried about trivial things like my weight and appearance.
    japanese:
      - 体重 {なん か}、見 た 目 {なん か}、どう で も いい こと に 悩ん でる。
      - 体重 {など}、見 た 目 {など}、どう で も いい こと に 悩ん でる。

        english: I'm worried about trivial things such as my weight and appearance.

          one's own concerns as trivial.
    scene: A person confiding in a friend about their self-consciousness, perhaps feeling they worry too
      much about superficial things.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The repeated use of 「なんか」 (nanka) serves to self-deprecate or dismiss the importance of one's
      own concerns about weight and appearance, almost as if saying 'I'm worrying about these trivial
      things like X and Y'. This nuance of downplaying one's own concerns is common in casual, intimate
      conversations, especially among female speakers.

      implying other healthy foods might also be part of his diet. It's a neutral listing.

          of conversations.
    scene: Someone expressing their preference for avoiding negative conversations.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: serious

      of things the speaker dislikes, subtly conveying a dismissive attitude towards them as trivial or
      unpleasant.

          as just "a student and such," implying a lack of professional experience.
    scene: A young person politely declining to comment on a business topic, citing their student status
      as a general reason for their inexperience.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    nuance: Using 「学生など」 implies "just a student, among other things (like being young or inexperienced)",
      subtly downplaying one's status in a humble manner, a common politeness strategy in Japanese.

        english: Smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches have also become commonplace.
        hint: This is a neutral list. We're looking for a more casual and somewhat dismissive way to group
          these technologies, perhaps implying their omnipresence.
    scene: Someone commenting on the rapid proliferation of smart devices in modern society.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: The repeated use of 「なんか」 casually lists various smart devices, implying "these kinds of devices".
      It can carry a slight nuance of "these commonplace/everyday things", reflecting their widespread
      adoption without necessarily a strong negative connotation, but rather a sense of familiarity or
      even a hint of "everyone has these trivial things now".
