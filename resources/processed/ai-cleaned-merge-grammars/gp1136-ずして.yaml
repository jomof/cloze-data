        "Exception": "する becomes せずして"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずして」 is derived from the negative auxiliary verb 「ず」 (which indicates negation) combined with the particle 「して」 (in the te-form of 「する」 meaning 'to do'). This combination creates a structure that expresses the meaning of 'without doing' or 'instead of doing'. It suggests that an action is performed in the absence of another action.",
    "writeup": "「ずして」 is a formal expression that means \"without doing something\" or \"instead of doing something.\" It is often used in written language and formal speech. The verb it modifies is in its negative form (ない form without the い + ず, or せず for する). Note that it carries a more sophisticated tone than alternatives like 「～ないで」 or 「～ずに」.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   This grammar point is generally used in more formal contexts.\n*   It emphasizes the absence of an action.",

            "setting": "informative",
            "speaker_gender": "male",
            "nuance": "The「～した」at the end indicates that this is being stated as a fact. It would be more casual if it was 「田中さんは、結婚式をせずに、海外へ引っ越した。」, but the sentence retains a formality due to the「ずして」.",
            "etymology": "「引っ越した」 means moved. It combines「引く」(hiku, to pull) and「越す」(kosu, to exceed)."

            "etymology": "「移る」 means move, and the sentence means literally 「move to execution」."
