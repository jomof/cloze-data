        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Commonly used in formal writing and speech. It carries a more sophisticated and often literary tone compared to its more colloquial counterparts. It emphasizes the complete absence of the preceding action or state."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずして」 is derived from the classical Japanese negative auxiliary verb 「ず」 (which indicates negation) combined with the particle 「して」 (the te-form of the verb 「する」, meaning 'to do' or 'to cause'). This ancient combination has evolved to create a structure that expresses the meaning of 'without doing' or 'instead of doing', highlighting an action or state occurring in the absence of another expected action or state.",
    "writeup": "「ずして」 is a formal and often literary expression indicating that an action or state occurs **without** a preceding action, or **in the absence of** a particular condition. It conveys a strong sense of non-performance or non-occurrence, often with a nuance of inevitability or an unexpected outcome.\n\nWhile sharing a similar meaning with more common expressions like 「～ないで」 or 「～ずに」, 「ずして」 carries a significantly higher degree of formality and is typically found in written language, academic texts, public speeches, or very formal conversations. Its use imbues a statement with a classic, somewhat profound, or even dramatic tone.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n*   **Formal Register**: Primarily used in formal or literary contexts, it is rarely encountered in everyday casual speech.\n*   **Emphatic Negation**: It strongly emphasizes the absence of the action it negates, often implying a logical consequence or a surprising result.\n*   **Structure**: It attaches to the negative stem (未然形 - mizenkei) of verbs. For godan verbs, this is usually the い-stem + ず. For ichidan verbs, it's the stem + ず. The verb する is irregular, becoming 「せずして」.\n*   **Implied Condition**: In some cases, it can imply a conditional 'if... not' or 'unless' clause, particularly when followed by a consequence, as seen in examples like 「今勉強せずして、いつするのか？」(If you don't study now, when will you?).\n*   **Timelessness**: It can also suggest an action occurring 'before' another, emphasizing that the prior action was not completed or experienced.",
