id: gp9999
meaning: to be (adjective) and; because it is (adjective)
pronunciation:
  katakana: クテ
  romaji: kute
formation:
  I-adjective (remove い) + くて: Used to connect adjectives or clauses, often implying a sequential or causal
    relationship.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: casual
  usage-context: Connecting multiple adjectival descriptions, stating a reason, forming compound sentences.
  function: Conjunction, reason/cause, sequential listing.
  nuance: Provides a smooth flow between descriptive clauses or explicitly states a cause.
etymology: The て form in Japanese verbs and adjectives historically derives from a conjunctive particle
  used to link actions or states. For い-adjectives, the い ending undergoes a sound change (音便 - onbin)
  to く before attaching the conjunctive て, forming くて. This structure inherently combines the descriptive
  nature of the adjective with a connective or causal function, reflecting its role in linking events
  or describing a state that leads to another.
writeup: 'The い-Adjective + くて form is a fundamental and versatile construction in Japanese grammar. It
  serves primarily two main functions: 1. **Connecting clauses or listing adjectives:** Similar to the
  English "and," it allows you to link multiple i-adjectives or clauses where the i-adjective describes
  the subject of the clause. For example, you can say 「この 部屋 は 広く{て} 明るい です」 (This room is spacious and
  bright). It creates a smoother flow than simply listing separate sentences. 2. **Expressing cause or
  reason:** It can convey "because it is (adjective)" or "since it is (adjective)." For instance, 「忙しく{て}
  宿題 が できません でした」 (Because I was busy, I couldn''t do my homework). In this usage, the adjective describes
  the reason for the subsequent action or state. It''s important to remember that くて connects the stem
  of the i-adjective, specifically after the final い is removed. This transformation is consistent across
  all i-adjectives, except for いい (good), which exceptionally becomes よく{て}. While the politeness level
  is determined by the end of the sentence (e.g., adding です/ます), the くて form itself is neutral and can
  be used in both casual and formal contexts.'
false_friends:
  - term: な-Adjective + で
    meaning: to be (na-adjective) and; because it is (na-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the equivalent connective form for な-adjectives and nouns. While い-Adjective + くて
      works for i-adjectives, な-Adjective + で serves the same conjunctive and causal purpose for な-adjectives
      and nouns. For example, 「静か{で} きれいな 町 です」 (It's a quiet and beautiful town).
    grammar_point: '[Noun]で・[na-Adj]で (and・because)'
  - term: から
    meaning: because; so
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: から is a general particle used to state a reason or cause for a clause. While い-Adjective +
      くて can express cause, から is more broadly applicable to any clause. い-Adjective + くて directly connects
      the adjective's state as the reason, whereas から can follow a full clause. For instance, 「寒い から、出かけたくない」
      (Because it's cold, I don't want to go out).
    grammar_point: '[Clause]から (because・so)'
  - term: 〜がる
    meaning: to show signs of feeling; to act as if
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 'This form also attaches to the stem of adjectives, but its function is entirely different:
      it indicates that someone appears to feel or show a certain emotion, often for third-person subjects.
      It doesn''t connect clauses or express causation. For example, 「寒{がる}」 (to seem cold, to complain
      about the cold).'
    grammar_point: '[i-Adj-stem]がる・[na-Adj]がる (to show signs of feeling)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While い-Adjective + くて, な-Adjective + で, and から all can express a causal relationship,
  their usage differs based on the part of speech they modify and their scope. くて and で are specifically
  for connecting adjectives (and nouns for で), directly linking the state described by the adjective to
  the subsequent clause. から functions as a general connector for entire clauses, providing a reason. The
  〜がる form, while attaching to an adjective stem, changes the adjective into a verb expressing a manifestation
  of emotion, not a connective or causal relationship.

          formal context.

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how い-Adjective + くて can be used to link two descriptive
  clauses about a single subject, or to present the adjective's state as the direct cause for a subsequent
  event or feeling. Pay close attention to the irregular form of 「いい」 becoming 「良く{て}」, as this is a common
  point of confusion for learners.
