id: gp9999
meaning: connecting i-adjectives to form compound phrases or to indicate a cause/reason, meaning "and"
  or "because".
pronunciation:
  katakana: くて
  romaji: kute
formation:
  い-Adjective (remove final い) + くて: Connects two i-adjectives or an i-adjective to a verb/adjective,
    indicating sequence or cause.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The `~くて` ending for i-adjectives derives from the classical Japanese adverbial form of adjectives,
  where `い` changes to `く` (e.g., 美しい becomes 美しく). The particle `て` (originally `にて`) is then suffixed,
  serving to connect clauses sequentially or causally, much like its function with verbs. Essentially,
  it transforms the adjective into an adverbial phrase that links to the subsequent part of the sentence.
writeup: |-
  The `い-Adjective[くて]` form is a crucial and versatile conjugation of i-adjectives. It functions primarily in two ways:

  **1. Connecting Multiple I-Adjectives or Adjectives to Verbs:**
  This form allows you to link two or more i-adjectives together to describe a single noun or situation. For instance, to say "big and heavy," you would use `大きいくて重い` (Ōkī kute omoi). The `くて` form acts like "and," creating a compound description. You can also connect an i-adjective to a verb, effectively turning the adjective into an adverbial modifier of the verb, describing the manner or state in which the action occurs. For example, `速くて走る` (Hayakute hashiru) means "run quickly."

  **2. Expressing Cause or Reason:**
  Similar to the `て` form of verbs, `い-Adjective[くて]` can be used to state a reason or cause for a subsequent action or state. In this case, it can be translated as "because (it is/was)..." or "so (it is/was)..." The cause precedes the effect. For example, `忙しくて、パーティーに行けなかった` (Isogashikute, pātī ni ikenakatta) means "Because I was busy, I couldn't go to the party." It implies a natural consequence or explanation.

  - term: な-Adjective[で] (te-form)
    meaning: connecting na-adjectives or indicating cause/reason.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「い-Adjective[くて]」 is specifically for i-adjectives, forming the adverbial `く` form plus `て`.
      「な-Adjective[で]」 is for na-adjectives, which behave like nouns and take the `で` particle in their
      connective form. Both can express "and" or "because", but their application depends on the adjective
      type.
    grammar_point: な-Adjective[で] (te-form)
  - term: Verb[て] (and then)
    meaning: connecting verbs, actions, or expressing cause/reason.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「い-Adjective[くて]」 and 「Verb[て]」 are "te-forms" and can link clauses or express
      cause, 「い-Adjective[くて]」 is used for adjectives to describe qualities or states, while 「Verb[て]」
      is used for verbs to describe actions or processes.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] (and then)
  - term: '[Clause]から (because・so)'
    meaning: indicating a reason or cause (stronger, more direct).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「い-Adjective[くて]」 can imply a reason as part of a descriptive phrase (e.g., 寒くて震えた - I shivered
      because it was cold). 「から」 explicitly states the reason after a complete clause and often implies
      a direct consequence or assertion (e.g., 寒いから、震える - It's cold, so I'm shivering).
    grammar_point: '[Clause]から (because・so)'
  - term: '[Clause]ので (because・so)'
    meaning: indicating a reason or cause (softer, often used for explanations or polite requests).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「から」, 「ので」 follows a full clause to give a reason. However, 「ので」 creates a softer,
      more explanatory tone compared to the more direct cause/effect implied by 「い-Adjective[くて]」 when
      used for reason, or the assertive tone of 「から」.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]ので (because・so)'
  - term: い-Adjective + Noun (describing nouns)
    meaning: directly modifying a noun.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「い-Adjective[くて]」 is a conjunctive form that connects adjectives or clauses, for example,
      「大きいくて速い犬」 (a big and fast dog) where 「大きい」 is linked to 「速い」. In contrast, 「大きい犬」 (a big dog) simply
      uses the dictionary form to directly modify the noun. The `くて` form cannot directly modify a noun.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective + Noun (describing nouns)
post_false_friends_writeup: While `い-Adjective[くて]` serves to connect i-adjectives and express cause,
  it's important to distinguish it from other grammatical constructions. The key is to recognize that
  `くて` forms an adverbial phrase, allowing adjectives to modify other adjectives, verbs, or the entire
  subsequent clause. Particles like `から` and `ので` explicitly state reasons, often for a full preceding
  sentence, with varying degrees of directness or politeness. Adjectives in their dictionary form directly
  precede and modify nouns. Understanding these distinctions will help you accurately convey complex ideas
  and reasons in Japanese.
examples:
  - english: This room is small and dark.
    japanese:
      - この 部屋 は 小さく て 暗い です。
      - この 部屋、小さく て 暗い。
    english_literally: This room, small and dark is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 部屋 は 小さく て、そして 暗い です。
        english: This room is small, and then it is dark.
        hint: Adding 「そして」 creates a stronger pause and implies a sequence or additional thought rather
          than a single unified description. We're looking for a simple, natural connection of two qualities.
    scene: Describing a room's characteristics.

  - english: The test was difficult, so I couldn't answer.
    japanese:
      - 試験 は 難し {くて}、答え られ ませ ん でし た。

    english_literally: Test, difficult, could not answer.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 は 難しかっ た の で、答え られ ませ ん でし た。
        english: Because the test was difficult, I couldn't answer.
        hint: 「ので」 explicitly states the reason for the inability to answer. We're looking for a connection
          where the difficulty of the test naturally leads to not being able to answer, without explicitly
          stating 'because'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 は 難しかっ た から です、答え られ ませ ん でし た。
        english: It is because the test was difficult that I couldn't answer.
        hint: 「からです」 provides a very strong and assertive reason. We're looking for a more direct, flowing
          connection of the two clauses.
    scene: A student explaining their poor performance on an exam.

  - english: That dog is big and cute.

      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 犬 は 大きな 犬 です。
        english: That dog is a big dog.
        hint: Using the dictionary form of the adjective directly modifies the noun, rather than connecting
          two adjectives describing the same noun. We're looking to express two distinct qualities connected
          by 'and'.

        english: Today, the sky is blue, and it's beautiful.
        hint: The `し` particle lists multiple reasons or qualities with an implication of more to come,
          or a slightly stronger 'and'. We're looking for a simple compound description.

        english: The road was narrow, and then dangerous, so we had to be careful.
        hint: 「それから」 implies a sequence of events or separate items, not a combined description of the
          road's characteristics. We want to list the traits as a single cause.
    scene: Recounting a challenging journey.

        english: This book is interesting, and it is easy to read.

          combine them seamlessly as characteristics of the same book.

          - スープ は 熱い から、美味しい です。
        english: Because the soup is hot, it is delicious.
        hint: This suggests the heat is the reason for its deliciousness, which may not be the intended
          meaning. We want to describe two qualities simultaneously present.

        english: Because the coffee was hot, I couldn't drink it right away.
        hint: While 「ので」 also expresses reason, the `くて` form here integrates the reason more smoothly
          into the sentence flow, creating a slightly less explicit causal link.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その バッグ は 軽い そして 丈夫 です。
        english: That bag is light, and it is durable.
        hint: Using the dictionary form and 「そして」 makes it sound like two separate statements rather than
          two connected attributes of the same item. We want a compound description.
    scene: Shopping for a bag.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
post_example_writeup: As seen in these examples, the `い-Adjective[くて]` form is indispensable for concisely
  expressing multiple qualities or linking a cause to an effect involving i-adjectives. Remember that
  the final verb or adjective dictates the overall tense and politeness of the sentence. Mastering this
  form allows for more natural and fluid Japanese expressions.
