    "etymology": "The origin of だけ is debated, with possibilities including a derivation from 「丈 (take)」, referring to length or degree, or from 「竹 (take)」, used metaphorically to indicate a limited quantity. Regardless, its function as a limiting particle has been consistent.",
    "writeup": "「だけ」 is a particle used to convey the meaning of \"only\" or \"just,\" serving to restrict or limit the scope of the preceding word or phrase. It signifies that among various possibilities, only the specified item is true or has been selected.\n\nIt can attach to a wide range of words:\n*   **Nouns**: Directly attaches to a noun to indicate that *only* that noun is involved or relevant.\n*   **Verbs (dictionary form)**: When appended to a verb in its dictionary (plain) form, 「だけ」 limits the action to that specific verb. It can also be used in more complex constructions to mean \"as much as one can do something\" or \"do something to the fullest extent.\"\n*   **い-Adjectives**: When used with an い-adjective, it emphasizes that the given quality is the sole characteristic. This can sometimes carry a dismissive nuance, suggesting that the quality is present but insufficient or undesirable on its own.\n*   **な-Adjectives**: For な-adjectives, the usage varies. If 「だけ」 follows the stem of a な-adjective (e.g., 「暇だけ」), it often implies that the adjective's core essence is the *only* thing present, potentially with a slightly critical or dismissive tone. When 「だけ」 follows the な-form (e.g., 「暇なだけ」), it typically clarifies that the adjective is the *only* relevant quality in modifying something, providing a reason or explanation that excludes other factors.\n\nBeyond simple limitation, 「だけ」 also appears in expressions like 「できるだけ」 (as much as possible) or 「VれるだけVる」 (do as much as one can V), indicating an action performed to its maximum capacity or desire. These uses expand its meaning beyond mere restriction to encompass degrees or limits of possibility.",

If 「だけ」 follows the stem of a な-adjective (e.g., 「暇だけ」, 'just leisure'), it tends to imply that the noun's core essence or concept is the only thing present, often with a slightly dismissive or critical nuance. For instance, 「彼は暇だけ」 might imply 'He is nothing but idle' or 'All he has is free time.' Conversely, when 「だけ」 follows the な-form (e.g., 「暇なだけ」, 'only free (time)'), it emphasizes that the adjective modifies something, and this specific quality is the only one relevant to the discussion, as in 「彼が来ないのは暇なだけだ」 ('The reason he isn't coming is just that he's free/has nothing else to do').",

Lastly, 「のみ」 functions identically to 「だけ」 but in formal or written contexts. 「のみならず」 expands on the 'not only' concept in a formal register.
