    "etymology": "The origin of だけ is debated, with possibilities including a derivation from 「丈 (take)」, referring to length or degree, or from 「竹 (take)」, used metaphorically to indicate a limited quantity. Regardless, its function as a limiting particle has been consistent.",
    "writeup": "だけ is a particle used to express the idea of \"only\" or \"just.\" It indicates that while other possibilities might exist, only the specified thing is true or has been chosen. It serves to restrict or limit the scope of the preceding word or phrase.\n\n*   It attaches directly to nouns.\n*   When attached to a verb in its dictionary (plain) form, it limits the action to that specific verb.\n*   When used with an い-adjective, it emphasizes that the given quality is the sole characteristic.\n*   For な-adjectives, the formation varies depending on whether you are referring to the essential nature of the adjective (stem form) or its quality as a modifier (な-form). This distinction can subtly shift the nuance, as will be explained in the examples.",

If だけ follows the stem of a な-adjective (e.g., 「暇だけ」, 'just leisure'), it tends to imply that the noun's core essence or concept is the only thing present, often with a slightly dismissive or critical nuance. For instance, 「彼は暇だけ」 might imply 'He is nothing but idle' or 'All he has is free time.' Conversely, when だけ follows the な-form (e.g., 「暇なだけ」, 'only free (time)'), it emphasizes that the adjective modifies something, and this specific quality is the only one relevant to the discussion, as in 「彼が来ないのは暇なだけだ」 ('The reason he isn't coming is just that he's free/has nothing else to do').",
