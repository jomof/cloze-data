    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ともなく」 indicates that an action is performed without conscious intention or that the source or recipient of something is unknown or unspecified. It suggests a lack of purpose or direction in the action or origin. It is often used in formal writing and speech to add a sense of vagueness or lack of deliberate intent. The structure often involves repeating the same verb on both sides of 「ともなく」. For example, 「見るともなく見る」 (miru to mo naku miru) means \"to look at something without really seeing it.\"",
