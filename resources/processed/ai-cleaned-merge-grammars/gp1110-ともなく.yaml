        "usage-context": "Used to describe actions that happen without conscious effort or attention, or to indicate that the exact source, recipient, or time of an event is not clearly known or specified. It often carries a nuance of vagueness or a lack of deliberate intent.",
        "function": "To convey an unintended action or an unidentifiable source/recipient.",
        "nuance": "Suggests a passive or involuntary nature of an action, or a mysterious/unspecified origin. It differs from simply 'without intending to' by implying a continuous or ambient state of unconsciousness.",

        "spatial-flow": "Can describe an origin or destination that is vague or unknown (e.g., from somewhere, to nowhere in particular). It highlights the lack of precise spatial information. If describing an action, it suggests an internal, non-directed mental state rather than physical movement."
    },
    "etymology": "The 「と」 likely functions as a quotative particle here, setting up a state or condition. 「も」 adds a sense of generalization or 'even so', and 「なく」 is the negative form of 「ある」 (to be), implying an absence of clear intention or origin. Together, they convey a state of 'being without even [doing something]' or 'being from no specific [place/person]'.",
    "writeup": "「ともなく」 is an advanced grammar point used to express two main ideas: first, that an action is performed unconsciously or without deliberate intent; and second, that the specific origin, destination, or identity of something is unclear or unspecified. It conveys a sense of vagueness or lack of conscious engagement.\n\nWhen used with a repeated verb (e.g., **見るともなく見る** - to look without really looking; to glance idly), it emphasizes the passive and unintentional nature of the action. The subject is performing the action, but their mind or attention is not fully engaged.\n\nWhen combined with a wh-word and a particle (e.g., **どこからともなく** - from somewhere unspecified; **誰にともなく** - to no one in particular), it indicates that the specific detail (where, who, when, etc.) is unknown or not important. This usage often lends a slightly mysterious or ambiguous tone to the statement.\n\nThis expression is generally considered more formal than similar phrases and is commonly encountered in written Japanese or more refined speech.",
