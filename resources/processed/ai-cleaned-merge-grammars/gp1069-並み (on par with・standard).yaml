        "nuance": "When used alone as a noun (並), it often means 'average' or 'ordinary'. When appended to a noun, it implies meeting or exceeding the standard of that noun. It is most naturally used for things with a widely recognized standard or norm.",
        "grammatical-role": "Nouns, adjectives, and verbs that can be modified by 並み"
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「並み」 comes from the noun form of the classical verb 「並む」 (naramu), which shares the same meaning as the modern verb 「並ぶ」 (narabu), meaning \"to line up\" or \"to be in line.\" This etymology connects the grammar point to the idea of being aligned or on the same level as something else.",
    "writeup": "「並み」 is a versatile suffix that attaches to nouns to indicate that something is \"on par with,\" \"worthy of,\" or \"as standard for\" the preceding noun. It highlights a comparison where the subject is considered to be at the same level or standard as the noun it modifies. This often carries a nuance of exceeding expectations, especially when used in constructions like 「プロ 並み」 (on par with a professional).\n\nWhen 「並み」 is used as a standalone noun, typically written as 「並」 and followed by the particle 「の」 (e.g., 「並の 人」), it takes on the meaning of \"average\" or \"ordinary.\" This distinction is crucial for understanding its full range of applications.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「並み」 is most naturally used when the noun it refers to has a clear, well-recognized standard or norm. For instance, \"professional skill\" or \"summer heat\" have widely understood levels. If the \"norm\" is subjective or based purely on personal opinion, using 「並み」 might sound unnatural. For example, saying 「この ラーメン は 私 の 好み 並み だ」 (This ramen is on par with my preference) would be awkward because \"my preference\" is not a universally recognized standard.\n*   While 「並み」 often implies a positive comparison (e.g., someone's skill being surprisingly good), it can also be neutral or even negative, simply stating a factual equivalence.",
