        "Origin": "Slang abbreviation of 「という」.",
        "Register": "Very informal, slang.",
        "Usage": "Common in casual conversation, especially among younger speakers."
    },
    "etymology": "「つ」 originates from an abbreviation of 「という」. 「という」 is composed of the quotation particle 「と」 and the verb 「言う (いう)」 (to say). Over time, 「という」 was shortened to 「つ」 in very casual speech.",
    "writeup": "「つ」 is a slang grammar pattern derived from 「という」, meaning \"called (A),\" \"that (A) that was said,\" or \"known as (A).\" It's essentially a way to quote something previously stated. You might also encounter it as 「っつ」 or 「つう」.  Keep in mind that 「という」 is just a combination of the quotation particle 「と」 and the verb 「言う」 (to say). Since 「と」 is a quotation particle, 「つ」 can follow almost any word or statement. While it's strong slang, it's very common, especially among younger speakers. You'll often hear native speakers abbreviating 「という」 in various ways, with 「つ」 being the shortest. The slight pause in 「っつ」 can sometimes indicate annoyance or impatience, but not always. Even though 「言う」 disappears, standard conjugation rules still apply. If you need to emphasize that something \"was said\" (past tense) or \"is being said\" (progressive form), use structures like 「つった」 or 「つってん」. The 「ている」 becoming 「てん」 transformation is further explained in the 「ん」 slang lesson.",
