        "[Verb in past tense] + ものだ": "Expresses a nostalgic recollection of past events or habits."
    },
    "etymology": "「もの」 (mono) refers to 'thing' or 'matter', and 「だ」 (da) is the copula 'is'. The phrase essentially means 'it is the case that...' or 'it is true that...', emphasizing a strong feeling or recollection about a past event. The 「た」 (ta) indicates past tense, solidifying the recollection.",
    "writeup": "「たものだ」 is used to express nostalgic recollection of past events or habits. It conveys a sense that something was a common occurrence or a typical experience in the past. The nuance suggests the speaker is reminiscing or reflecting on those times with a certain fondness or sentimentality.\n\n*   This expression is similar to \"used to\" in English, but it carries a stronger emotional weight.\n*   It's not suitable for describing trivial or insignificant events. The event should hold some personal significance for the speaker to sound natural.\n*   「たものでした」is the polite form, used in more formal situations.",
