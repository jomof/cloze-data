    "etymology": "「もの」 refers to a thing or matter, and 「だ」 is the copula. The combination expresses a sense of something being inherently or typically the case. When used with a past tense verb, it conveys the idea that something \"was the way it was\" in the past, carrying a nuance of nostalgia or reminiscence.",
    "writeup": "「たものだ」 is used to express nostalgic feelings about past habits or states. It conveys that something \"used to be the case\". It implies that the speaker is reminiscing about something that holds significance for them. Because of this implication, using 「たものだ」 to describe trivial, insignificant events may sound unnatural. In such cases, 「たことがある」 might be more appropriate. This expression is more suited for conveying a sense of nostalgia or deep reflection on past experiences.",
