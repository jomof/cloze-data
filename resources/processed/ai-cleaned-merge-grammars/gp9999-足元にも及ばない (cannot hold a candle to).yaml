meaning: cannot hold a candle to
pronunciation:
  katakana: アシモトニモオヨバナイ
  romaji: ashimoto ni mo oyobanai
formation:
  '[Person/Thing X] は/が [Person/Thing Y] の 足元にも及ばない': Used to express that X is far inferior to Y.
jlpt: N1
etymology: The phrase literally translates to "cannot even reach one's feet." The "足元 (ashimoto)" refers
  to the ground near someone's feet, implying the lowest possible point in proximity or status. "及ばない
  (oyobanai)" means "cannot reach" or "cannot match." Thus, the idiom vividly conveys that the person
  or thing being compared is so inferior that it cannot even come close to the level of the other, not
  even to their feet, painting a picture of extreme disparity.
writeup: |-
  「足元にも及ばない」is an idiomatic expression used to emphatically state that someone or something is far inferior to another, meaning they "cannot hold a candle to," "are no match for," or "are nowhere near the level of" the other party. It conveys a strong sense that the comparison is not even close or that the inferior party is unworthy of being compared.

  This phrase is typically used in formal or semi-formal contexts, often in competitive situations like sports, business, or academic discussions, to highlight a significant disparity in skill, quality, or achievement. It can be used objectively to describe a factual difference, or to express humble self-assessment when comparing oneself to a highly skilled individual.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   The phrase explicitly states that the **subject** (X) cannot reach the level of the **object** (Y). The object of comparison (the superior one) is marked by 「の」before 「足元にも及ばない」.
  *   While strong, it's not inherently rude when used as a humble self-assessment, e.g., 「彼は私とは比べ物にならないほど才能があり、{彼の足元にも及びません}。」(He is so much more talented than I am; I can't even hold a candle to him.)
  *   When used to describe a third party, it can sound dismissive or arrogant if not used carefully, especially in direct address. It implies a definitive judgment of inferiority.

  - term: に及ばない
    meaning: is no match for, cannot reach
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「足元にも及ばない」is a more emphatic and idiomatic way of saying 「に及ばない」. It emphasizes the vastness
      of the difference, suggesting the inferior party cannot even reach the lowest point (the feet) of
      the superior one.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:には及ばない (no match for)
  - term: 比べ物にならない
    meaning: cannot be compared; is incomparable
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「足元にも及ばない」specifically indicates inferiority, 「比べ物にならない」can also mean incomparably *superior*
      or just generally incomparable due to vast difference, not necessarily only inferiority. It can
      also imply a qualitative difference that makes comparison meaningless.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:比べ物にならない (is incomparable)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「足元にも及ばない」is a potent idiom expressing extreme inferiority. While 「に及ばない」also
  means "is no match for," it lacks the strong, almost dismissive nuance of "cannot even reach one's feet"
  that 「足元にも及ばない」carries. 「比べ物にならない」can also indicate a vast difference, but it is a more neutral term
  that can apply to superiority as well as inferiority, or simply an inability to compare due to fundamental
  differences rather than just a difference in degree of skill or quality.

      - 技術 の 面 で は、あの 若手 選手 は ベテラン チャンピオン の {足元 に も 及ば ない}。
    english_literally: As for technique's aspect, that young player is not even able to reach the veteran
      champion's feet.

        english: In terms of technique, that junior player is no match for the veteran champion.
        hint: This phrase is less emphatic than the target grammar, suggesting a smaller gap in ability
          rather than a vast, unbridgeable one. We're looking for a phrase that specifically denotes extreme
          inferiority.

        hint: 「比べられない」means "cannot be compared" in a more general sense, not necessarily emphasizing
          vast inferiority like 「足元にも及ばない」. We're looking for a phrase that specifically denotes extreme
          inferiority.

        hint: 「比較になりません」means something is 'incomparable' but doesn't convey the same level of emphatic

        english: His acting skills are so superb, ordinary actors cannot possibly reach his level.
        hint: 「到底及びません」implies that it's simply not possible to reach that level, but lacks the specific,
          vivid imagery of being unable to even approach someone's feet. We're looking for a phrase that
          illustrates a vast, almost absurd difference.

          Vinci.
        hint: While 「比べ物にならない」also expresses a huge difference, it doesn't carry the specific meaning
          of inferiority as strongly. It can mean incomparable because one is vastly superior, or simply
          in a different category. We're looking for a phrase that specifically highlights falling far
          short of someone's ability.

          a much greater degree of inferiority, as if one can't even get close. We're looking for a phrase
          that conveys a significant, almost laughable disparity.

        hint: 「格が違う」means 'to be in a different league or class' which implies a difference in quality,
          but 「足元にも及ばない」more specifically indicates a complete inability to measure up. We're looking
          for a phrase that expresses deep self-humbling in comparison.

        english: Even my older brother's excellent grades are not comparable to our father's when he was
          young.
        hint: 「比ではない」means 'not comparable' or 'incomparable', but it is a slightly more literary or formal
          expression than the more common and vivid idiom. We're looking for a phrase that suggests a
          complete inability to measure up.

        hint: 「太刀打ちできない」means 'cannot compete' or 'cannot stand up against', which is similar but less
          about inherent inferiority in being and more about a lack of competitive ability. We're looking
