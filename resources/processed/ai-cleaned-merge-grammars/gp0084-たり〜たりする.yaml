    "etymology": "The 'たり' comes from the ta-form (past form) of a verb + 'り'. The 'り' is a conjunctive particle that indicates listing actions or states. Combining this with 'する' (to do) creates a pattern to express doing things like X and Y.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 'たり〜たりする' (tari ~ tari suru) is used to list actions, conditions, or states without implying a specific order or completeness. It conveys the meaning of \"doing things like...\" or \"sometimes... and sometimes...\". The final 'たり' is usually followed by 'する' (suru) or 'した' (shita) to indicate present/future or past tense, respectively.\n\n**Key points:**\n*   'たり' is attached to the **past form** (た form) of verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives and nouns + 'だ'.\n*   It suggests that the listed items are examples and not an exhaustive list.\n*   The actions or states described don't necessarily happen in a specific order.\n*   When the last verb is a 'する' verb, the 'たり' is sometimes omitted, but this is not recommended for learners.",
