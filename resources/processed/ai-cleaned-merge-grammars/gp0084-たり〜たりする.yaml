    "etymology": "The particle 'たり' originates from the 'ta-form' (past form) of verbs, adjectives, or nouns followed by the conjunctive particle 'り'. This 'り' particle historically functioned to list actions or states. When combined with 'する' (to do), it forms the grammatical pattern 'たり〜たりする' which explicitly denotes an inexhaustive list of actions, states, or qualities. This pattern evolved from describing past completed actions to indicating a sampling of typical or recurring events.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「たり〜たりする」 (tari ~ tari suru) is used to list actions, conditions, or states without implying a specific order or that the list is exhaustive. It conveys the meaning of \"doing things like...\" or \"sometimes... and sometimes...\". The final する is typically followed by する (suru) or した (shita) to indicate the present/future or past tense, respectively. However, たり is not limited to just two items; you can list multiple たり phrases before the final する.\n\n**Key Points:**\n*   たり is attached to the **ta-form** (past form) of verbs, い-adjectives (e.g., 高かったり), な-adjectives (e.g., 静かだったり), and nouns plus だったり (e.g., 学生だったり).\n*   It suggests that the listed items are examples and not an exhaustive list. The speaker implies there are other unmentioned actions or states.\n*   The actions or states described do not necessarily happen in a specific order, or they may happen intermittently.\n*   While it's most commonly seen with two たり phrases, a single たり followed by する (e.g., 本を読んだりする) means \"to do things like read books,\" implying other similar activities.\n\n**Comparison with Te-form:**\nUnlike the て-form (te-form), which connects sequential or related actions, たり〜たりする explicitly indicates a non-sequential or alternating nature of actions or states. For example:\n*   ご飯を食べて、テレビを見る。 (Gohan o tabete, terebi o miru.) - \"I eat rice, then watch TV.\" (Implies sequence)\n*   ご飯を食べたり、テレビを見たりする。 (Gohan o tabetari, terebi o mitari suru.) - \"I do things like eat rice and watch TV.\" (Implies non-specific order, possibly alternating, and other activities might also occur).",
