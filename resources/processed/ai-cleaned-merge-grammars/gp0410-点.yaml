    "writeup": "「点」 (ten) is a versatile kanji used to express a specific **point**, **aspect**, or **respect** of something. When attached to the attributive form of a word or phrase, it highlights that word or phrase as a point of interest. Think of it as spotlighting a particular angle or perspective. \n\nCommon translations include:\n\n*   \"From the aspect of (A)\"\n*   \"In respect to (A)\"\n*   \"In terms of (A)\"\n\nThe structure is usually 「[Attributive form] + 点 + で」. You might also see 「〜という点」 or 「〜の点」. The 「で」 can be replaced with phrases like 「について」 (\"in relation to\") or 「からいうと」 (\"speaking from\").",
