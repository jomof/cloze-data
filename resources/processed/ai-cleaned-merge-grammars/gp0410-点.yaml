    "etymology": "The kanji 点 (ten) literally means 'dot' or 'spot'. Its semantic development led to its use in a more abstract sense, signifying a specific 'point' or 'aspect' within a larger context. This evolution reflects how a 'dot' can represent a single, distinct element in a broader picture or argument, thus enabling its application to denote a specific respect or viewpoint.",
    "writeup": "「点」(ten) is a fundamental kanji that signifies a specific **point**, **aspect**, or **respect** in a discussion or comparison. It functions as a nominalizer, allowing a preceding word or phrase to be singled out as the particular focus.\n\nThis grammar point is highly versatile and is commonly translated as:\n\n*   “From the aspect of (A)”\n*   “In respect to (A)”\n*   “In terms of (A)”\n*   “From the point of view of (A)”\n\n### Formation Guidelines\n\n「点」 is typically attached to the **attributive form** of another word, a noun followed by 「の」, or a phrase followed by 「という」. In most common usages, 「点」 **must** be followed by the case-marking particle 「で」. For example:\n\n*   **[Noun (Attributive Form)] + 点 + で**: Used when the preceding word is an adjective or verb in its plain form directly modifying 「点」. For instance, 「難しい点」(difficult point) or 「良い点」(good point).\n*   **[Noun] + の + 点 + で**: Used when connecting a noun directly to 「点」, indicating that the noun itself is the specific aspect being considered. For example, 「その点」(that point) or 「値段の点」(the point of price).\n*   **[Phrase] + という + 点 + で**: This construction is used to refer to a complex statement or idea as a specific point or aspect. The 「という」 acts as a quotative particle, turning the entire preceding phrase into a noun-like clause that 「点」 then modifies. For example, 「彼が正直であるという点」(the point that he is honest).\n\n### Usage with other particles\n\nWhile 「で」 is the most common particle following 「点」, it can sometimes be replaced by other expressions that also serve to highlight a specific focus or relationship. For instance, 「について」(in relation to) or 「から言うと」(speaking from/from the perspective of) can precede 「点」, especially when further elaborating on the highlighted aspect. However, it's crucial that the accompanying grammatical structure also functions to draw attention to something specific and can logically be paired with a noun, to ensure natural Japanese usage.",
