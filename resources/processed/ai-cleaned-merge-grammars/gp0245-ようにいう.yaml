        "colocation": "Often followed by a verb in its plain form (non-past, either affirmative or negative). Can be used with '言う' (to say), '頼む' (to request), or '命じる' (to order), each conveying a different degree of formality and authority. The choice of verb depends on context and desired tone.",

        "temporal-flow": "The telling/requesting occurs before the instructed action, though the instruction itself might pertain to an ongoing or future state."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ように言う」 (youni iu) is composed of 「よう」 (you), the nominalizer meaning 'way' or 'manner,' and 「に」 (ni), a particle indicating means or result, followed by the verb 「言う」 (iu), 'to say.' Historically, 「よう」 derived from 「様」 (sama), meaning 'appearance' or 'state,' and gradually evolved to signify 'manner,' 'way,' or 'in order to.' The combination 「ように」 thus means 'in such a way that' or 'so that.' When paired with a verb like 「言う」, it forms an indirect command structure, signifying the act of saying something 'in a manner such that [action] is done' or 'so that [action] occurs.' This construction highlights the desired outcome or method of the action being instructed, rather than a direct, unvarnished command.",
    "writeup": "「ように言う」 is an expression used to convey that someone is told, requested, or ordered to do something in a specific manner. It combines the auxiliary verb 「よう」 with the verb 「言う」. The 「よう」 takes its adverbial form 「ように」 when linking to 「言う」.\n\nThis grammar point signifies that the speaker is focusing on the **manner** in which the action is to be carried out. The person is being told to do something with a particular intention or instruction in mind, making it a nuanced form of indirect command or request.\n\nWhile 「言う」 is the most common verb used with 「ように」, conveying a general sense of telling, it can also imply either ordering or requesting, depending on the tone and overall context. For stronger implications of ordering, 「命じる」 (meijiru - to order) can substitute 「言う」. Conversely, for a clear request, 「頼む」 (tanomu - to request) can be used. Each of these verbs modifies the nuance of the instruction, ranging from gentle persuasion to firm decree.",
