    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ものではない」 is composed of 「もの」 (thing), 「で」 (copula), 「は」 (topic marker), and 「ない」 (negative). Literally, it means something along the lines of \"it is not the case that something is.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ものではない」 is used to express that something **should not** be done, is **impossible** to do, or is simply **not the natural course of things**. It carries a sense of advice, prohibition, or impossibility. Think of it as a stronger, more emphatic way of saying 「～べきではない」 or 「～てはいけない」.\n\nIt's often used to express general truths, social norms, or strong personal feelings about something. For example, 「人に嘘をつくものではない」 (You shouldn't lie to people) expresses a fundamental moral principle.\n\nWhen used with the potential form of a verb, it often indicates that something is simply impossible or unbearable, such as 「彼の歌は聞けたものではない」 (I couldn't bear to listen to his song).",
