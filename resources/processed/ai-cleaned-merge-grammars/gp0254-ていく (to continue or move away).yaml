pronunciation:
  katakana: テイク
  romaji: teiku
formation:
  Verb in Te-form + いく: Indicates that something will start and continue, or that something is moving
    away from the speaker.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to describe an action that moves away from the speaker's current location or perspective,
    or an action that continues from the present into the future.
  function: Indicates direction of action or continuation over time.
  nuance: Implies a sense of progression, whether spatial or temporal. It can describe a process that
    initiates and extends forward or a movement away from the speaker's viewpoint.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a compound verb, modifying the preceding verb's meaning.
  temporal-flow: Indicates an action or state that continues from the present moment into the future,
    or a process that unfolds over time.
etymology: The grammar point 「ていく」 is a combination of the 「て」-form of a verb and the verb 「いく」(iku),
  which means "to go." The 「て」-form connects actions, and 「いく」 indicates movement away from the speaker.
  Over time, this combination evolved to express the idea of something starting and continuing, or moving
  away.
writeup: |-
  This grammar construction combines the 「て」 particle with the verb 「行く」 (iku, "to go"). To use it, attach 「て」 to a verb, then follow it with 「いく」. The nuance is usually that "(A) happened and then went," or "will happen, and then go." In other words, it depends on whether 「いく」 is in present or past tense.

  「ていく」 can represent time or a physical place. When representing a physical place, the kanji form 「行く」 is more likely, but this isn't a strict rule. When used in relation to time, the nuance is usually that something has already started or is about to start, and then will continue to progress in the same way.

  This is the opposite of 「てくる」, which indicates that something has finally reached a certain state after progressing in that way for some time.

  Compared to English, 「ていく」 is similar to the phrase "to go on to (A)" in relation to time. It focuses on the speaker's journey to a specific point. For example, "She went on to become a doctor after university."

    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ていく」, 「へいく」 simply indicates direction or destination and doesn't imply an ongoing
      action.
    grammar_point: へいく (to head toward)
  - term: Verb+にいく (go to do)
    meaning: To go to ~, To go in order to ~
    kind: similar expression

      an action.

  - term: はじめる (to start doing)
    meaning: To start, To begin to

  - term: てくる (movement towards or gradual change)
    meaning: To come to, To become, To continue, To be starting to, Has been ~ing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ていく」, 「てくる」 describes something approaching or accumulating over time, not moving
      away.
    grammar_point: てくる (movement towards or gradual change)
post_false_friends_writeup: When using 「ていく」, remember that it implies continuation or movement away.
  Be careful not to confuse it with similar expressions like 「へいく」 (direction), "Verb+にいく" (purpose),
  「はじめる」 (initiation), or 「てくる」 (approach/accumulation). Focus on whether the action is starting and continuing
  or simply a one-time event.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 公園 へ 歩く。
        english: He walks to the park.
        hint: The simple verb 「歩く」 means 'to walk' without emphasizing the continuous movement away from
          the speaker's perspective. We're looking for an action that starts and continues away.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 公園 に 向かう。
        english: He heads toward the park.
        hint: 「向かう」 simply means 'to head toward' or 'to face,' without the nuance of continuous movement
          or progression away. We're looking for an action that starts and continues away.
    scene: A man is leaving his house, and someone is observing his movement.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The use of 「歩いていく」 emphasizes the action of walking and moving away from the speaker's current
      location or perspective, highlighting the continuous nature of his journey towards the park. It
      focuses on the action of 'walking' combined with 'going'.
  - english: Could you please take these documents to Mr. Yamada?
    japanese:

          - この 資料 は、山田 さん に 届け て いただけ ます か。
        english: Could you please deliver these documents to Mr. Yamada?
        hint: 「届ける」 means 'to deliver' or 'to send,' focusing on the completion of the delivery rather
          than the action of carrying something away from the speaker's location. We're looking for an
          action that emphasizes taking something away.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 資料 は、山田 さん に 持っ て いっ て ください。
        english: While correct, this is a direct command. The original implies a more polite, indirect
          request asking if the listener can perform the action. We're looking for a softer, more deferential
          phrasing.
        hint: While correct, this is a direct command. The original implies a more polite, indirect request
          asking if the listener can perform the action. We're looking for a softer, more deferential
          phrasing.
    scene: A colleague asks another to deliver documents in a polite office setting.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The use of 「持っていって いただけます か」 is a polite request that implies the act of carrying something
      away from the current location to another. It uses the te-form of 「いく」, making the request very
      formal and respectful in a business context. The combination of 「持って」 (holding) and 「いって」 (going)
      highlights the completion of the delivery task.
    etymology: The polite request form 「〜て いただけ ます か」 is a common and versatile expression used to ask
      for a favor in a humble manner, literally meaning "Can I receive the favor of you doing ~?"
  - english: I'll copy the necessary documents for the meeting and take them with me.
    japanese:

          - 会議 に 必要 な 資料 を コピー し て 持参 する よ。
        english: I'll copy and bring the necessary documents (with me) for the meeting.
        hint: 「持参する」 means 'to bring (something) with oneself,' often implying preparation for a specific
          event. While similar, it doesn't emphasize the action of 'taking away' as strongly as 「持っていく」.
          We're looking for an action that describes taking something from one place to another.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 に 必要 な 資料 を コピー し て 持っ て くる よ。
        english: I'll copy the necessary documents for the meeting and bring them (here).
        hint: 「〜てくる」 indicates movement toward the speaker's location, whereas 「〜ていく」 indicates movement
          away. This implies bringing the documents to the speaker, not taking them away. We're looking
          for an action that describes taking something away.
    scene: A person is telling a colleague their plan before a meeting.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The casual 「もっていく よ」 indicates the speaker's intention to perform an action (copying) and
      then move away with the result (the copied documents). The 「よ」 particle adds a sense of assertion
      or informing the listener of a decision.

        english: I want to continue cherishing this wonderful experience from now on.
        hint: 「し続ける」 emphasizes direct continuation without the added nuance of progression into the future
          that 「ていく」 provides. We're looking for an action that implies a forward-moving process.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 素晴らしい 経験 を、これ から も 大切 に し たい です。
        english: I want to cherish this wonderful experience from now on.
        hint: This phrase expresses a desire to cherish, but it lacks the sense of ongoing action or a
          process extending into the future. We're looking for an action that implies a forward-moving
          process.
    scene: After a memorable event, someone expresses their lasting feelings about it.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: desiderative (～たい)
    nuance: 「していきたい」 conveys a desire for an action or state to continue progressing into the future.
      It's not just about starting to cherish, but about maintaining that act of cherishing as time moves
      forward. The polite 「です」 ending makes it suitable for various respectful contexts.

          - 日本 の 経済 は、少し ずつ 回復 し た。
        english: Japan's economy gradually recovered.
        hint: This simply states that the economy recovered. It does not carry the nuance of a continuous

          gradual progression in the past.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 の 経済 は、少し ずつ 回復 し 続け た。
        english: Japan's economy gradually continued to recover.
        hint: 「し続けた」 indicates direct continuation of an action but might imply more intentional effort
          or a sustained state rather than a natural, unfolding progression as 「ていった」 suggests. We're
          looking for an action that shows gradual progression in the past.
    scene: An economist describes the past trajectory of the national economy.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「回復 して いった」 expresses a gradual, continuous process of recovery that happened over time. The
      past tense of 「いく」 (いった) shows that this progression occurred in the past, emphasizing the unfolding
      of the recovery as time passed.

        hint: This expresses a general intention to work hard but lacks the sense of continued effort
          or moving forward together into the future that 「ていこう」 conveys. We're looking for an action
          that implies continued effort and progression.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この チーム で、ずっと 一緒 に 頑張り 続けよう。
        english: Let's continue working hard together as this team.
        hint: 「頑張り続けよう」 directly means 'let's continue working hard,' but 「ていこう」 can imply a more natural
          progression or path forward, rather than just sustained effort. We're looking for an action
          that implies continued effort and progression.
    scene: A team leader encourages their members after a tough project, aiming for future success.

        english: From now on, I will lead a more environmentally friendly life.
        hint: This simply states a future action without emphasizing the continuous progression of that
          action over time. 「ていく」 specifically highlights the ongoing nature. We're looking for an action
          that implies a sustained effort over time.
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ から は、もっと 環境 に 優しい 生活 を 送り 始める。
        english: From now on, I will start leading a more environmentally friendly life.
        hint: 「送り始める」 focuses on the initiation of the action, not its continuation or progression into

    scene: A person decides to change their lifestyle for environmental reasons and states this commitment.

          implies progression over time.
    scene: Someone contemplating the future changes in their hometown.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「経っていく」 emphasizes the continuous, forward movement of time and the gradual changes that occur
      as a result. The phrase 「〜に つれて」 means "as (something happens)", reinforcing the idea of a linked
      progression.
