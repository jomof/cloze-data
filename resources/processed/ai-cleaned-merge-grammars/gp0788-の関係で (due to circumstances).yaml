    "writeup": "「の関係で」 indicates that something happens or does not happen because of a particular reason or circumstance. It's similar to \"due to\" or \"because of\" in English. It is more commonly used in relatively formal contexts. 「関係」 means \"relationship\" or \"connection\". It is a versatile phrase used to explain reasons or circumstances, often in a formal or semi-formal context. It suggests a direct causal relationship between the noun and the resulting situation. While 「ので」 and 「から」 can also express reasons, 「の関係で」 emphasizes the connection or relationship as the cause.",
