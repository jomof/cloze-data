    "etymology": "The word 「僅か(わずか)」 originates from the verb 「分く(わく)」, meaning \"to divide or separate\". It implies something that has been divided into a very small portion.",
    "writeup": "「僅かに (wazuka ni)」 is an adverbial form of the な-adjective 「僅か (wazuka)」. It is used to express a very small amount, degree, or extent, often emphasizing that something is 'merely', 'barely', or 'slightly' present or true.\n\nWhile 「僅か」 can function as a な-adjective meaning 'trifling' or 'meager', its adverbial form 「僅かに」 is far more common. It frequently appears at the beginning of sentences or clauses to introduce a statement about a minimal quantity or difference. This expression can be employed to convey modesty, implying that one's contribution or opinion is nothing more than a minor aspect, or simply to highlight the precise smallness of something.\n\n**Important Note on Usage:**\n「僅か」 can also be used as a noun without the particle 「に」. In such cases, it refers to a 'meager thing', a 'trifle', or an 'insignificance', indicating something exceptionally small in size or number. However, this usage is less common than its adverbial form.",
