    "writeup": "「僅かに (wazuka ni)」 is an adverbial form of the な-adjective 「僅か (wazuka)」. It is used to express a very small amount, degree, or extent, often emphasizing that something is 'merely', 'barely', or 'slightly' present or true.While 「僅か」 can function as a な-adjective meaning 'trifling' or 'meager', its adverbial form 「僅かに」 is far more common. It frequently appears at the beginning of sentences or clauses to introduce a statement about a minimal quantity or difference. This expression can be employed to convey modesty, implying that one's contribution or opinion is nothing more than a minor aspect, or simply to highlight the precise smallness of something.Important Note on Usage:「僅か」 can also be used as a noun without the particle 「に」. In such cases, it refers to a 'meager thing', a 'trifle', or an 'insignificance', indicating something exceptionally small in size or number. However, this usage is less common than its adverbial form.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「たった(の)」 often carries a connotation of surprise or disappointment due to the small amount, while 「僅かに」 is more neutral and simply describes a small quantity.",
