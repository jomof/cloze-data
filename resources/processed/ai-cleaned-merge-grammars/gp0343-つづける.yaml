    "etymology": "The verb 「続ける (つづける)」 is derived from the verb 「続く (つづく)」, which means \"to continue\" or \"to last.\" 「続ける」 is the transitive form, meaning \"to continue something,\" while 「続く」 is intransitive, meaning \"something continues.\"",
    "writeup": "The verb 「{続ける} (tsuzukeru)」 means \"to continue.\" By attaching 「続ける」 to the -masu stem of another verb, you can express the continuation of that action. This indicates that an action is being done continuously. For example, 「走り{続ける}」 means \"to continue running.\"\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   The nuance of connecting one verb to another via the -masu stem form differs from using the 「て」 conjunction. The former implies \"(A) is done in the way of (B),\" while the latter implies \"(A) is done, and then (B).\"\n*   「続ける」 is a transitive verb. It takes a direct object, meaning you are *doing* the continuing.",
