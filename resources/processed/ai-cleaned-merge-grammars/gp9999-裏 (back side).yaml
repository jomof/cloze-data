  usage-context: Used to describe the opposite side of something, the inside of an object, or abstractly,
    the concealed or true nature behind appearances or actions.
  function: To specify a location, an inner or hidden surface, or a non-obvious aspect.

etymology: The kanji 裏 (ura) literally means 'inside' or 'rear'. Historically, it has referred to the
  inner part of clothing or the reverse side of a surface. This core concept of 'inwardness' or 'reversal'
  extended to abstract meanings like 'behind the scenes' or 'hidden truth', as these are also 'inside'
  or 'reversed' from what is outwardly presented.
writeup: |-
  The word 裏 (ura) is a versatile noun in Japanese that encompasses several related meanings, all stemming from the core idea of a 'reverse' or 'inner' side. Its usage can be broadly categorized into concrete and abstract applications.

  **Concrete Meanings:**

  1.  **The physical back or reverse side:** This is the most straightforward use. For example, the back of a piece of paper (紙の裏), the other side of a coin (コインの裏), or the back of a building (建物の裏). In this sense, it is directly opposed to 表 (omote), which means the 'front' or 'face' side.

  2.  **The inside of an object, especially clothing:** When referring to clothing, 裏 (ura) means the lining or the inside surface (例: コートの裏 - the lining of a coat). This is also in contrast to 表 (omote), which would be the outer fabric.

  **Abstract Meanings:**

  1.  **Behind the scenes; hidden aspect:** This is a common abstract usage. It refers to what happens out of public view, the true intentions, or the less visible reality behind an apparent situation. For instance, `裏で動く` means 'to work behind the scenes' or 'to pull strings'. Similarly, `裏の顔` (ura no kao) implies a 'hidden face' or 'secret personality'.

  2.  **The other side of a situation or argument:** It can also denote the opposite perspective or the negative aspect of something, akin to 'the flip side' in English. For example, discussing `物事の裏表` (monogoto no ura omote) means considering both the good and bad or front and back aspects of things.

  Understanding 裏 often requires grasping its relationship with 表 (omote), as they form a fundamental pair in Japanese culture and language, representing opposing but interconnected aspects of things.

  - term: 表 (omote)
    meaning: Front side; surface; public face
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While 裏 refers to the reverse, hidden, or inner side, 表 refers to the front, visible, or public
      side. They are direct opposites and often used together as a pair, like `裏表` (ura omote - front
      and back, or two-faced).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:表 (front side)
  - term: 奥 (oku)
    meaning: Inner part; back; depth; inside (of a house/room)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 奥 refers to the deep inside or furthest part of a space, implying depth or a secluded area.
      裏, on the other hand, means the reverse side or the hidden surface of something. While both can
      refer to 'inside' aspects, `奥` suggests 'deep within' (e.g., `部屋の奥` - the back/depth of the room)
      whereas `裏` suggests 'the other side' or 'lining' (e.g., `本の裏` - the back cover of a book).
    grammar_point: 奥,手前 (depth・foreground spatial)
  - term: 裏切る (uragiru)
    meaning: To betray; to go against expectations
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 裏 (ura) is a noun meaning 'back side' or 'hidden aspect'. 裏切る (uragiru) is a verb meaning
      'to betray' or 'to go back on (a promise/expectation)'. While 裏切る contains the kanji 裏, it functions
      as a verb and describes an action of breaking trust or expectations, distinct from the noun 裏.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:裏切る (to betray)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 裏 from its false friends, remember that 表 (omote) is its
  direct opposite, always referring to the front or visible side. 奥 (oku) describes depth or the furthest
  inward point of a space, unlike 裏 which denotes the reverse surface or hidden aspect. Finally, 裏切る (uragiru)
  is a verb, signifying the act of betrayal, while 裏 (ura) itself is a noun referring to a side or aspect.

    setting: professional
    nuance: '`裏` in the context of clothing specifically refers to the `lining`, which is the inner, less
      visible layer of fabric, as opposed to `表` (omote), the outer layer.'
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 裏 (ura) can be used both concretely for physical
  'back' or 'inside' surfaces, and abstractly for 'hidden' or 'behind-the-scenes' aspects. The meaning
  often becomes clear from context and the nouns it modifies or the verbs it combines with, such as `裏口`
  (back entrance) or `裏の顔` (hidden face). Its pairing with 表 (omote - front) is particularly important
  for understanding its core meaning.
