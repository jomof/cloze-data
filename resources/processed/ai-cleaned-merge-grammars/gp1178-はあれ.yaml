        "usage-context": "Used to acknowledge the existence of a condition or factor while emphasizing that it does not negate or overshadow the main point.",
        "function": "Concessive particle/phrase",
        "nuance": "Carries a formal and slightly literary nuance, often found in written language or highly formal speech. It explicitly states an existing fact that is being conceded, as opposed to a hypothetical one.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a concessive conjunction, connecting a preceding noun (the conceded fact) to a contrasting statement."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「はあれ」 is a classical Japanese construction derived from the particle 「は」 (wa), which marks contrast or emphasis, and the imperative form 「あれ」 (are) of the verb 「ある」 (aru), meaning 'to exist' or 'to be'. In this context, the imperative form does not denote a command but rather a concessive, almost antiquated usage, meaning 'let there be' or 'even if there is'. This evolution highlights the historical depth of Japanese grammar, where older forms are preserved in specific, fixed expressions to convey particular nuances like formality and concession.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「はあれ」 expresses the idea of \"even though there is something...\" or \"although there is...\". It serves to acknowledge a specific condition or factor that exists, while simultaneously setting it aside or minimizing its impact in favor of the subsequent statement. This expression is distinctly formal and carries a sophisticated, often literary, tone, making it prevalent in **formal writing** and **speeches**. It functions similarly to English phrases such as \"notwithstanding\" or \"despite the existence of\".\n\n「はあれ」 emphasizes that the preceding noun, while a factual condition, does not diminish the truth or importance of the main clause that follows. It's crucial to understand that 「はあれ」 is used for conditions that are *known to exist*, differentiating it from expressions that deal with hypothetical or uncertain situations.",

Use 「はあれ」 when you are acknowledging something that is factually true and exists at the moment of speaking or writing, but you wish to present it as secondary to a more important point. Conversely, 「あっても」 is employed when considering a condition that might or might not occur, or to express a general concession for any possible scenario. Choosing 「はあれ」 adds a layer of formality and a subtle emphasis on the existing nature of the conceded point.",
