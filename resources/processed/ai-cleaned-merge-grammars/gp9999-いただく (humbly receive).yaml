pronunciation:
  katakana: イタダク
  romaji: itadaku
formation:
  Verb[te-form] + いただく: To humbly receive the favor of someone doing an action for the speaker.
  Noun + を + いただく: To humbly receive a noun (e.g., an object, food, or drink).
  いただく (as a main verb): Humble equivalent of 食べる (taberu) 'to eat' or 飲む (nomu) 'to drink'.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The word 「いただく」 (itadaku) literally means 'to place on one's head,' deriving from the act of
  receiving something from a superior and respectfully raising it to one's head before accepting it. This
  physical gesture of reverence evolved into the humble verbal expression for receiving, eating, and drinking,
  signifying the speaker's deference and gratitude.
writeup: |-
  「いただく」 (itadaku) is a verb belonging to Kenjōgo, or humble language, which Japanese speakers use to lower themselves to show respect to others. It has two primary uses:

  1.  **As a humble main verb**: It functions as the humble equivalent of 食べる (taberu, to eat), 飲む (nomu, to drink), and もらう (morau, to receive). This usage is very common, especially when accepting food or drink, or when receiving an object from someone in a higher position or someone you want to show respect to.

  2.  **As a humble auxiliary verb**: When attached to the te-form of another verb (Verb-te + いただく), it means 'to humbly receive the favor of someone doing [Verb] for me.' This construction indicates that the speaker is gratefully receiving an action or service from another person. The subject of the te-form verb is the person performing the action for the speaker, and the speaker is the one benefiting from it.

  It is crucial to remember that 「いただく」 is **always** used from the perspective of the speaker (or the speaker's in-group) receiving something or benefiting from an action. It is never used to describe someone else receiving something, nor is it used when the speaker is giving something. The usage implicitly acknowledges a social hierarchy, where the speaker is in a lower position relative to the person giving or doing the action.
false_friends:
  - term: もらう (to receive)
    meaning: to receive
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「いただく」 and 「もらう」 mean 'to receive,' 「いただく」 is humble language (kenjōgo), used to
      show extreme respect and humility towards the giver or the person performing an action for you.
      「もらう」 is polite but does not carry the same degree of humility. You use 「もらう」 when referring to
      receiving from peers or when less deference is needed.
    grammar_point: もらう (to receive)
  - term: くださる (to give, honorific)
    meaning: to give (honorific)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「いただく」 expresses the humble act of *receiving*, while 「くださる」 is the honorific (sonkeigo) verb
      for *giving*. 「くださる」 is used when someone of higher status gives something to you or performs an
      action for you, emphasizing their graciousness.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:くださる (honorific give)
  - term: 謙譲語 (humble language)
    meaning: humble language
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いただく」 is a specific example of humble language (kenjōgo). Kenjōgo is a broader category of
      respectful Japanese that lowers the speaker's status to elevate the listener's or a third party's
      status. While 「いただく」 is a key component, there are many other forms of kenjōgo.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:謙譲語 (humble language)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「いただく」 and 「もらう」, consider the level of respect
  you wish to convey. If the person giving or doing the action is a superior, or if you want to express
  profound gratitude, 「いただく」 is appropriate. For peers or less formal situations, 「もらう」 is sufficient.
  As for 「くださる」, remember it's about the other person giving, not you receiving, and it also uses a high
  level of respect for the giver.

          - 申し訳 あり ませ ん、それ は 受け取れ ませ ん。
        english: I'm sorry, I cannot receive that.
        hint: 「いただきかねます」 is a more formal and indirect way to express inability to accept, often used

    scene: A businessperson politely declining an offer.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: potential (～られる/～える)
    nuance: The phrase 「いただきかねます」 uses the auxiliary verb form 「いただく」 combined with 「かねる」 (kaneru, to
      be unable to), creating a very polite and indirect refusal. This phrasing is common in formal situations
      where a direct 'no' would be considered impolite, showing consideration for the other party.

      a deeper sense of appreciation for the parents' favor, reflecting traditional Japanese family dynamics.

      part of a respectful exchange.
