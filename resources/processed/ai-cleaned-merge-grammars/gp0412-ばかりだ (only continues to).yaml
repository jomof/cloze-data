    "etymology": "The adverbial particle 「ばかり」 (bakari) originally meant 'only' or 'just'. When combined with a verb and the copula 「だ」, it expresses the idea that something is continuously moving in one direction, typically emphasizing a trend or gradual change. The 「だ」 functions as a declarative copula, indicating a state of being or truth. The underlying sense of 'only' or 'just' carries over, implying that the action or state is exclusively progressing in a single direction.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ばかりだ」 (bakari da) is used to express that something continues to move in one direction, or that one action is exclusively happening, often suggesting a negative or undesirable trend. It's similar to saying \"only continues to\" or \"keeps on -ing\" in English. It typically attaches to the **dictionary form** of a verb. It can also be used in the polite form 「ばかりです」.\n\nThis grammar is most commonly used with verbs that describe some form of change, such as increasing or decreasing, getting better or worse, becoming faster or slower, etc. It implies that the situation is solely progressing in that specific direction. While often associated with negative trends, 「ばかりだ」 can also describe positive trends, although this usage is less common. The nuance of exclusivity or singular focus on that trend is key.\n\nIf the speaker wishes to extend the sentence with additional information after 「ばかりだ」, the copula 「だ」 will change to its conjunctive te-form 「で」, becoming 「ばかりで」. This allows the phrase to connect to subsequent clauses, often to express a consequence or further observation regarding the continuous trend.",
