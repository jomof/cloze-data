    "etymology": "The grammar point 「いかん〜ず」 combines 「いかん」 (ikan), meaning \"how\" or \"in what way,\" with 「ず」 (zu), a classical negative auxiliary verb. This combination creates a structure that expresses the idea of something being unaffected or independent of a particular condition or manner.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「いかん〜ず」 (ikan ~ zu) is a formal expression used to indicate that something remains the same or is unaffected regardless of a certain condition or reason. 「いかん」 means \"how\" or \"in what way,\" and 「ず」 is a classical negative auxiliary verb. It typically appears in the pattern: **Noun + の + いかん + に + [関わらず/よらず/を問わず]**. The phrases commonly used with this pattern are: * 「関わらず」 (かかわらず): regardless of, without being related to * 「よらず」 (よらず): regardless of, without depending on * 「を問わず」 (をとわず): regardless of, without questioning. This grammar is often used in formal writing, legal documents, or official announcements to convey impartiality or that a decision or outcome doesn't change based on certain factors. It conveys the nuance of \"without taking (A) into account.\"",
