details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: general usage context
  function: To express the act of delegating responsibility, giving discretion, or ceding control over
    something to another party or to external forces like luck or fate.
  nuance: Implies a complete transfer of responsibility or control for a specific task or outcome. It
    carries a sense of confidence in the recipient or resignation to external factors.
etymology: 任せる (makaseru) is derived from 任 (nin), meaning 'responsibility' or 'duty,' and せる (seru),
  the causative form suffix, indicating 'to cause to do' or 'to entrust.' Therefore, 任せる literally means
  'to cause someone to take on a responsibility.' The particle を marks the object being entrusted, and
  に indicates the recipient of the responsibility.
writeup: The structure 「(A) を (B) に任せる」 highlights that something (A) is being "entrusted" or "left up
  to" (B). This is a standard function of the verb 「任せる」, a る-verb meaning "to entrust". In this construction,
  「(A) を」 identifies the task or matter being entrusted, while 「(B) に」 identifies the person, group, or
  even abstract concept (like fate or luck) to whom (A) is being left. This expression is versatile; it
  can be used for delegating a specific task to an individual, or for resigning oneself to the outcome
  of a situation left to chance or destiny. It implies a complete transfer of responsibility or control.

  - term: 〜に頼む
    meaning: to ask X to do Y, to request Y from X
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜に頼む」 implies asking for a favor or requesting a task. While it involves someone doing something,
      it doesn't necessarily mean full responsibility or discretion is entrusted to them, unlike 「〜に任せる」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:頼む (to ask or request)
  - term: 〜に預ける
    meaning: to leave something in someone's care, to deposit
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜に預ける」 refers to temporarily leaving an item or person in someone's safekeeping or care.
      It focuses on custody or temporary storage, whereas 「〜に任せる」 emphasizes the delegation of responsibility
      for a task or outcome.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:預ける (to leave in care)
  - term: 〜に委ねる
    meaning: to commit oneself to, to entrust (oneself) to, to leave (something) to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「〜に委ねる」 is a close synonym to 「〜に任せる」, often used in more formal or literary contexts, especially
      when talking about committing oneself or a large entity to a higher power or fate. 「〜に任せる」 is more
      common in everyday delegation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:委ねる (to entrust or commit)
  - term: 〜任せ
    meaning: leaving to or relying on
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜任せ」 is a compound noun or adjective that implies passively leaving things to someone/something
      or a state of being dependent on them, often with a nuance of carelessness or lack of personal effort.
      「任せる」 is the active verb of entrusting.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜任せ (leaving to or relying on)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「〜に任せる」 focuses on delegating responsibility with implied trust or resignation,
  「〜に頼む」 is simply making a request. 「〜に預ける」 is about placing something in temporary care, not necessarily
  task delegation. 「〜に委ねる」 is a more formal or literary alternative, particularly when referring to a
  surrender of control to abstract forces like fate or a higher power, whereas 「〜に任せる」 is more broadly
  applicable to both tasks and abstract outcomes. Lastly, 「〜任せ」 often carries a nuance of carelessness
  or lack of personal effort, in contrast to the active delegation implied by 「任せる」.
examples:
  - english: I decided to leave this important project up to him.
    japanese:
      - この 大事 な プロジェクト を 彼 に {任せる} こと に し た。
      - この 大事 な プロジェクト は 彼 に {任せる} こと に し た。
      - この 重要 な プロジェクト を 彼 に {任せる} こと に 決め まし た。
    english_literally: This important project, to him, to entrust, I decided.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 大事 な プロジェクト を 彼 に {頼む} こと に し た。
        english: I decided to ask him for this important project.
        hint: 「頼む」 means to ask for something or request a task. While it involves someone doing something,
          it doesn't necessarily mean full responsibility is entrusted to them. We're looking for an expression
          that signifies entrusting a task fully.
    scene: A manager is deciding who will handle a crucial project. They have several capable team members
      but need to select one to take full ownership.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「した」 (shita) at the end of the sentence indicates a casual decision-making tone.
      The nuance of 「この 大事 な プロジェクト を 彼 に 任せる」 (kono daiji na purojekuto o kare ni makaseru) conveys a
      sense of confident delegation and trust from a manager to a subordinate, typical in a professional
      but not overly formal setting.
    etymology: The word 「プロジェクト」 (purojekuto) is a loanword from English 'project'.
  - english: We will entrust the future to the next generation.
    japanese:
      - 次 の 世代 に 未来 を {任せ ます}。
      - 未来 を 次 の 世代 に {任せ ます}。
      - 我々 は 未来 を 次 の 世代 に {任せ ます}。
    english_literally: Next generation to, future, entrust.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 次 の 世代 に 未来 を {委ね ます}。
        english: We will commit the future to the next generation.
        hint: 「委ねる」 is a very close synonym but often used in more formal or literary contexts, especially
          when talking about committing something abstract like the future or oneself to a higher power
          or fate. We're looking for a common, formal expression of entrusting something significant.
    scene: A public speaker is addressing a graduating class or a group of young leaders, expressing hope
      and confidence in their abilities.
    register: formal
    setting: inspirational
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The polite ending 「〜ます」 (masu) is suitable for a public address. The phrase 「次 の 世代 に 未来 を
      任せます」 (tsugi no sedai ni mirai o makasemasu) carries a hopeful and somewhat solemn tone, emphasizing
      the transfer of responsibility for the future. The speaker, likely an older male, uses a formal
      and encouraging tone to a younger audience.
    etymology: 「未来」 (mirai) combines 未 (mi), meaning 'not yet,' and 来 (rai), meaning 'come,' hence 'not
      yet come' or 'future.'
  - english: I left everything up to fate, so I have no regrets.
    japanese:
      - 僕 は 運命 に 全て を {任せ た} から 後悔 は ない。
      - 運命 に 全て を {任せ た} から 後悔 は ない よ。
      - 全て を 運命 に {任せ た} ん だ、だ から 後悔 は ない。
    english_literally: I, fate to, all, entrusted, so regret not exist.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 僕 は 運命 に 全て を {委ね た} から 後悔 は ない。
        english: I committed everything to fate, so I have no regrets.
        hint: 「委ねる」 is a more formal and literary verb for 'to entrust' when dealing with abstract concepts
          like fate, often implying a deeper surrender. We're looking for a more common expression for
          leaving things up to fate in casual speech.
    scene: A man reflecting on a major life decision where the outcome was uncertain, but he chose to
      let things unfold naturally.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「僕」 (boku) is a common masculine first-person pronoun in casual speech. The phrasing
      「運命 に 全て を 任せた」 (unmei ni subete o makaseta) implies a resignation to external forces, which is
      common in philosophical or reflective contexts. The lack of a polite ending (e.g., 「〜ました」) reinforces
      the casual, introspective nature of the statement.
    etymology: 「運命」 (unmei) means 'fate' or 'destiny.' 運 (un) refers to 'luck' or 'fortune,' and 命 (mei)
      refers to 'life' or 'command.'
  - english: When busy, it's better not to leave the small details to her.
    japanese:

      - 忙しい 時 は、細かい こと を 彼女 に {任せ ない} 方 が いい です よ。
      - 彼女 に 細かい こと を {任せ ない} 方 が いい、忙しい 時 は ね。
    english_literally: Busy time is, small things, her to, not entrust, better.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 忙しい 時 は、細かい こと は 彼女 に {頼ま ない} 方 が いい。
        english: When busy, it's better not to ask her for small details.
        hint: 「頼む」 means to ask or request, implying a task is given to someone but not necessarily that
          full responsibility is delegated. We're looking for an expression that indicates not entrusting
          full responsibility for details.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing delegation strategies for their busy period, and one offers advice
      about another's work habits.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「〜ない 方 が いい」 (nai hou ga ii) indicates giving advice or a recommendation. The use
      of 「彼女 に 任せない」 (kanojo ni makasenai) specifically refers to not delegating tasks, implying a lack
      of confidence in her ability to handle details when under pressure. This sentence is spoken between
      colleagues, suggesting a professional yet candid exchange.
    etymology: 「細かい」 (komakai) implies minuteness or attention to detail.
  - english: I left the baby's care to my mother and went shopping.
    japanese:
      - 赤ちゃん の 世話 を 母 に {任せ て}、買い物 に 行っ た。
      - 母 に 赤ちゃん の 世話 を {任せ て}、買い物 に 行き まし た。
      - 赤ちゃん の 世話 を 母 に {任せ て} おい て、買い物 に 出かけ た の。
    english_literally: Baby's care, mother to, entrusted, went shopping.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 赤ちゃん の 世話 を 母 に {預け て}、買い物 に 行っ た。
        english: I left the baby's care with my mother and went shopping.
        hint: 「預ける」 implies temporarily leaving something or someone in someone's care, like depositing
          an item. While it's about care, it doesn't carry the same nuance of entrusting full responsibility
          for the care. We're looking for an expression of delegating the responsibility of care.
    scene: A young mother explaining how she managed to get errands done while having a baby.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The casual tone and use of 「行った」 (itta) for 'went' without a polite ending is characteristic
      of casual female speech when informing someone. The use of 「任せて」 (makasete) implies the mother fully
      entrusted the responsibility of childcare to her own mother, not just temporarily leaving the baby
      with her.
    etymology: 「世話」 (sewa) implies care, looking after, or aid. It is often written in hiragana when referring
      to general caregiving.
  - english: If we leave the work to him, it will surely succeed.
    japanese:
      - もし 彼 に 仕事 を {任せれ ば}、きっと 成功 する だろう。

          - もし 彼 に 仕事 を {頼め ば}、きっと 成功 する だろう。
        english: If we ask him for the work, it will surely succeed.
        hint: 「頼む」 means to ask or request someone to do something. While this could lead to success,
          it doesn't emphasize giving full discretion or responsibility for the work. We're looking for
          an expression that implies delegating the task with trust in his ability.
    scene: A team leader is trying to convince their supervisor that a particular team member is capable
      of handling a new assignment.
    register: formal
    setting: persuasive
    conjugation: conditional (～ば)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The conditional 「〜ば」 (ba) here expresses a strong conviction about the outcome if the action
      is taken. The use of 「きっと 成功 する だろう」 (kitto seikou suru darou) implies a persuasive tone from a
      team leader to a supervisor. A female speaker using this structure conveys confidence and professionalism.
      「だろう」 is slightly less formal than 「でしょう」 but still common in persuasive contexts.
    etymology: 「成功」 (seikou) is formed from 成 (sei), meaning 'to become' or 'to achieve,' and 功 (kou),
      meaning 'merit' or 'achievement.'
  - english: Let's leave the success or failure of this mission to your skill.
    japanese:
      - この 任務 の 成否 は 君 の 腕 に {任せよう}。
      - この 任務 の 成否 は 君 の 腕 に {お 任せ しよう}。
      - 任務 の 成否 は 君 の 腕 に {任せる} こと に しよう。
    english_literally: This mission's success or failure, your skill to, let's entrust.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 任務 の 成否 は 君 の 腕 に {頼もう}。
        english: Let's ask your skill for the success or failure of this mission.
        hint: 「頼む」 means to ask for something, which doesn't convey the same level of confident delegation
          and reliance on a person's abilities. We're looking for an expression that signifies entrusting
          the outcome to someone's skill.
    scene: A military commander giving a critical mission to a highly skilled soldier, emphasizing their
      complete trust in the soldier's abilities.
    register: formal
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: volitional (～よう)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「君 の 腕 に 任せよう」 (kimi no ude ni makaseyou) implies a direct and authoritative, yet
      trusting, tone, common in military or mentor-mentee relationships. 「君」 (kimi) is typically used
      by older males speaking to younger individuals. The volitional 「〜よう」 (you) signals a firm decision
      or proposal by the speaker, emphasizing their trust and delegation to the subordinate.
    etymology: 「成否」 (seihI) is a compound of 成 (sei), meaning 'to become' or 'to achieve,' and 否 (hi),
      meaning 'failure,' indicating 'success or failure.'
  - english: I can rest assured because this whole plan can be left to the CEO.
    japanese:
      - この 企画 は 全て 社長 に {任せ られる} から 安心 です。
      - この 企画 は 全て 社長 に {お 任せ できる} の で 安心 です。
      - 全て の 企画 を 社長 に {任せ られる} から 心配 ない です よ。
    english_literally: This plan, all, CEO to, can be entrusted, so relieved.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 企画 は 全て 社長 に {頼め る} から 安心 です。
        english: I can rest assured because I can ask the CEO for this whole plan.
        hint: 「頼める」 means 'can ask', focusing on the ability to make a request. It doesn't imply the comprehensive
          delegation of the entire plan with full discretion. We're looking for an expression that denotes
          the capability of entrusting a plan entirely.
    scene: A team member expresses relief about a major company plan, knowing it's in capable hands.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: potential (～られる/～える)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The potential form 「任せられる」 (makaserareru) here indicates the capability of entrusting the
      plan to the CEO, emphasizing the speaker's confidence and relief. The polite 「安心 です」 (anshin desu)
      makes this suitable for a professional setting. The phrase 「お任せできる」 (omakase dekiru) is an honorific
      form of 'can entrust,' showing respect towards the CEO, commonly used by a female employee.
    etymology: 「企画」 (kikaku) combines 企 (ki), meaning 'to plan' or 'to undertake,' and 画 (kaku), meaning
      'to draw' or 'to design,' referring to a 'plan' or 'project.'
  - english: I'm terribly sorry to ask, but please leave everything about this matter to you.
    japanese:
      - 大変 恐縮 です が、この 件 は あなた に 全て {任せ て ください}。
      - 誠 に 恐縮 です が、この 件 は あなた に 全て {お 任せ 願え ます か}。
      - この 件、全て あなた に {任せ て} いただけ ませ ん でしょう か。
    english_literally: Very sorry, but, this matter, you to, all, please entrust.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 大変 恐縮 です が、この 件 は あなた に 全て {頼ん で ください}。
        english: I'm terribly sorry to ask, but please ask you for everything about this matter.
        hint: 「頼む」 means to ask or request. While polite, it doesn't convey the sense of fully delegating
          and entrusting the entire matter with all its responsibility. We're looking for an expression
          that signifies delegating full control.
    scene: An overwhelmed junior employee is asking a senior colleague for help with a difficult matter,
      emphasizing their complete reliance.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: imperative polite (～なさい)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「大変 恐縮 です が」 (taihen kyoushuku desu ga) is a very polite and apologetic opening,
      typical of a junior asking a significant favor from a senior. 「任せてください」 (makasete kudasai) is a
      polite imperative, indicating a strong request for delegation, almost like pleading. This usage
      highlights the junior employee's reliance and deferential attitude.
    etymology: 「恐縮」 (kyoushuku) means 'feeling obliged' or 'apologetic.' It is often used to express gratitude
      or embarrassment when someone has gone out of their way for you.
  - english: She sometimes says she's leaving her life up to chance.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 時々、自分 の 人生 を 偶然 に {任せ て いる} と 言う。
      - 彼女 は 時々、自分 の 人生 を 偶然 に {任せ て} いる と 言い ます ね。
      - 時々、彼女 は 人生 を 偶然 に {任せ て} いる と 語る よ。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 時々、自分 の 人生 を 偶然 に {委ね て いる} と 言う。
        english: She sometimes says she's committing her life to chance.
        hint: 「委ねる」 is a more formal and literary verb for 'to entrust' or 'to commit,' especially when
          dealing with abstract concepts like life or fate. While similar, 「任せる」 is more commonly used
          in everyday speech for this idea. We're looking for the more common, natural expression.
    scene: Two friends are discussing their mutual acquaintance's approach to life.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「言う」 (iu) in its plain form suggests a casual conversation between close friends.
      The overall sentence structure and vocabulary are neutral, suitable for a female speaker in a casual
      setting. The progressive form 「任せている」 (makasete iru) indicates an ongoing state of leaving things
      to chance, reflecting a personal philosophy or habit.
    etymology: 「偶然」 (guuzen) is formed from 偶 (guu), meaning 'by chance' or 'accidentally,' and 然 (zen),
      meaning 'so' or 'like that,' implying 'being so by chance' or 'by accident.'
  - english: I left the interior design completely up to the designer.
    japanese:
      - 私 は インテリア デザイン を 全て デザイナー に {任せ た}。
      - インテリア デザイン は 全て デザイナー に {任せ た}。
      - 私 は インテリア デザイン を 全部 デザイナー に {任せ た}。
      - インテリア デザイン は 全部 デザイナー に {任せ た}。
      - インテリア デザイン は 全部 デザイナー に {任せ た} ん だ。
    english_literally: I, interior design, all, designer to, entrusted.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は インテリア デザイン を 全て デザイナー に {頼ん だ}。
        english: I asked the designer for all the interior design.
        hint: 「頼む」 means to ask or request. While you might ask a designer, 「任せる」 conveys the act of entrusting
          the entire task and discretion to them. We're looking for an expression of full delegation.
    scene: A homeowner talking to a friend about their newly renovated house, expressing satisfaction
      with the results achieved by giving the designer free rein.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「全てデザイナーに任せた」 (subete dezainaa ni makaseta) highlights the complete trust and confidence
      placed in the designer's professional skills and judgment. This is a common way to express giving
      full artistic or professional freedom, typical in a casual conversation between friends.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 「任せる」 is quite flexible. It can be used for
  delegating concrete tasks to people, for leaving abstract concepts like fate or future to external forces,
  and across various registers from casual conversation to formal speeches. The key is the complete transfer
  of responsibility or control.
