    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the noun 間 (aida, meaning 'interval,' 'space,' or 'time') with the particle に (ni), which indicates location or time. Thus, literally, it means \"in the space of\" or \"during the time of.\"",
    "writeup": "「の間に」 indicates that something happens or exists within a certain timeframe or physical space.  The action or state described by 「の間に」 typically occurs at a **specific point** within the given timeframe and doesn't encompass the entire duration.  It's like saying \"in the span of.\" It often pairs with 「まで」 to indicate a period *until* something happens.  When used with verbs or い-adjectives, simply add 「の間に」 after the plain form. For nouns, use 「の」 + 「間に」 and for な-adjectives, use 「な」 + 「間に」.",
