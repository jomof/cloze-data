    "etymology": "The grammar point 「の間に」 combines the noun 間 (aida), meaning 'interval,' 'space,' or 'time,' with the case-marking particle に (ni), indicating location or time. Historically, 間 referred primarily to physical space or distance between things. Over time, its usage expanded to denote a temporal interval, or the period between two points in time. The addition of に specifies that an action or state occurs *at some point within* this interval or space, rather than spanning its entirety. Thus, it literally translates to something like \"in the space of\" or \"during the time of.\"",
    "writeup": "「の間に」 is a versatile expression used to indicate that an event or action occurs **within a specific timeframe or physical space**. It consists of the noun 間 (aida), meaning 'interval' or 'space,' followed by the particle に (ni), which marks location or time.\n\nThe key nuance of 「の間に」 is that the action or state described usually happens at a **specific point** during the given period or within the given space, rather than continuously throughout the entire duration or occupying the whole space. It implies an event occurring *within* a span, emphasizing the interval.\n\n**Formation Rules:**\n\n*   **Verbs**: Attach directly to the plain form of a verb. For actions in progress, the ている form is common: (Verb Plain Form) + の間に. Example: 読んでいる間に (while reading).\n*   **い-Adjectives**: Attach directly to the い-adjective: (い-Adjective) + の間に. Example: 若い間に (while young).\n*   **な-Adjectives**: Require な before 「間に」: (な-Adjective Stem) + な間に. Example: 静かな間に (while quiet).\n*   **Nouns**: Require の before 「間に」: (Noun) + の間に. Example: 夏休みの間に (during summer vacation).\n\n**Usage with 「まで」:**\n\n「の間に」 is frequently paired with 「まで」 (made) to express a period or space 'from X until Y' or 'between X and Y'. The structure becomes 「X から Y までの間に」 (from X to Y, during which...). This emphasizes the bounded nature of the interval.\n\nThis grammar point can refer to both temporal intervals (e.g., during summer vacation) and spatial intervals (e.g., between two objects). When distinguishing between the two, context usually makes the meaning clear.",
