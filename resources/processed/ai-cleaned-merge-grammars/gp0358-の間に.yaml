        "function": "To indicate that an event or action occurs at a specific point within a given timeframe or physical space.",
        "nuance": "This grammar point emphasizes that the described action or state occurs at a *specific point* within a broader interval or space, rather than continuously throughout the entire duration. It highlights the interval as the containing period for a singular or punctual event.",

    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「の間に」 combines the noun 間 (aida), meaning 'interval,' 'space,' or 'time,' with the case-marking particle に (ni), indicating location or time. Historically, 間 referred primarily to physical space or distance between things. Over time, its usage expanded to denote a temporal interval, or the period between two points in time. The addition of に specifies that an action or state occurs *at some point within* this interval or space, rather than spanning its entirety. Thus, it literally translates to something like \"in the space of\" or \"during the time of.\"",
    "writeup": "「の間に」 is a versatile expression used to indicate that an event or action occurs **within a specific timeframe or physical space**. It consists of the noun 間 (aida), meaning 'interval' or 'space,' followed by the particle に (ni), which marks location or time.\n\n**Formation Rules:**\n\n*   **Verbs**: Attach directly to the plain form of a verb. For actions in progress, the ている form is common: (Verb Plain Form) + の間に. Example: 読んでいる間に (while reading).\n*   **い-Adjectives**: Attach directly to the い-adjective: (い-Adjective) + の間に. Example: 若い間に (while young).\n*   **な-Adjectives**: Require な before 「間に」: (な-Adjective Stem) + な間に. Example: 静かな間に (while quiet).\n*   **Nouns**: Require の before 「間に」: (Noun) + の間に. Example: 夏休みの間に (during summer vacation).\n\nThis grammar point can refer to both temporal intervals (e.g., during summer vacation) and spatial intervals (e.g., between two objects). When distinguishing between the two, context usually makes the meaning clear.",
