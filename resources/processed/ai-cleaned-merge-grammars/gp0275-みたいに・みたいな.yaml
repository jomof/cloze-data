        "part-of-speech": "auxiliary adjective",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "General conversation, common in both spoken and written Japanese.",
        "function": "Expresses similarity, resemblance, or subjective impression.",
        "nuance": "Indicates a subjective comparison or impression. It is more casual and often expresses a personal feeling compared to ような/ように.",

        "colocation": "Often follows nouns, verbs (plain form), or entire clauses.",

        "logical-flow": "Connects a subject to something it resembles or appears to be."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「みたい」 originates from the verb 「見る」 (miru, to see), which means 'to see' or 'to look'. Over time, it evolved to express a sense of resemblance or approximation based on visual or perceived similarities. This evolution highlights a linguistic pathway from concrete sensory perception to abstract comparison.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「みたいに」 and 「みたいな」 are forms of the auxiliary adjective 「みたい」. They express that something is \"like\", \"similar to\", or \"resembling\" something else. It is important to differentiate its usage based on what it modifies:\n\n*   When 「みたいな」 precedes a **noun**, it indicates that the noun is similar to something. For example, 「子供みたいな人」 (kodomo mitai na hito) means \"a person like a child\". In this context, 「みたいな」 functions like a な-adjective, directly modifying the following noun.\n*   When 「みたいに」 follows a **noun**, **verb (plain form)**, or **entire sentence**, it describes an action or state performed in a similar manner, or indicates an impression about the preceding statement. For example, 「鳥みたいに飛びたい」 (tori mitai ni tobitai) means \"I want to fly like a bird\". Here, 「みたいに」 functions like an adverb, modifying the verb or adjective that follows.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that 「みたい」 is an auxiliary adjective and should not be confused with 「見たい」 (mitai), which means \"want to see\". 「みたい」 itself does not have a kanji form and is always written in hiragana or katakana. This distinction is vital for accurate interpretation. While 「みたいだ」 is the plain form used at the end of a sentence to express an impression, 「みたいな」 modifies nouns, and 「みたいに」 modifies verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. The thing being described by 「みたいに」 or 「みたいな」 is not always directly adjacent to the particle, especially in longer sentences.",

            "nuance": "「と同じで/と違って」 are used for direct, explicit comparisons highlighting similarities or differences, often in a more formal or objective context, whereas 「みたいに」 is more subjective and casual, focusing on a resemblance or impression."

            "nuance": "In the sense of 'typical of,' 「らしい」 implies something is characteristic or befitting of a person or thing, indicating an inherent quality. In contrast, 「みたい」 suggests a superficial resemblance, a 'looks like' quality rather than an 'is like' quality."

            "nuance": "「そう」 is used to describe an immediate impression based on outward appearance or sensory input (e.g., looks delicious, sounds like rain). 「みたい」 can be used more broadly for any kind of resemblance, not limited to direct sensory input, and often carries a more subjective or personal feeling."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「ように」 focuses on following a standard or providing a more objective comparison, 「そう」 describes immediate sensory impressions, 「らしい」 is used for secondhand information or inherent characteristics, and 「みたい」 broadly expresses a subjective resemblance or impression. Pay attention to whether you want to emphasize a direct comparison, sensory impression, secondhand information, an inherent characteristic, or a simple, often subjective, resemblance.",

The use of 「ます」 indicates polite speech suitable for addressing a group or in a more formal setting.",
            "etymology": "The word 「イルカ」 (iruka) is a loanword from Portuguese 'golfinho' or 'orca', adopted into Japanese to refer to dolphins. Its association with graceful movement makes it a natural subject for comparison."

            "etymology": "The Japanese word for sky, 「空」 (sora), has ancient origins and is fundamental to natural descriptions. 「雪」 (yuki) for snow is also a long-standing term, reflecting Japan's seasonal climate."
