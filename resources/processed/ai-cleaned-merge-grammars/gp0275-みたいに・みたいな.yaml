    "etymology": "The term 「みたい」 originates from the verb 「見る」 (miru, to see), which means 'to see' or 'to look'. Over time, it evolved to express a sense of resemblance or approximation based on visual or perceived similarities. This evolution highlights a linguistic pathway from concrete sensory perception to abstract comparison.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「みたいに」 and 「みたいな」 are forms of the auxiliary adjective 「みたい」. They express that something is \"like\", \"similar to\", or \"resembling\" something else. It is important to differentiate its usage based on what it modifies:\n\n*   When 「みたいな」 precedes a **noun**, it indicates that the noun is similar to something. For example, 「子供みたいな人」 (kodomo mitai na hito) means \"a person like a child\". In this context, 「みたいな」 functions like a な-adjective, directly modifying the following noun.\n*   When 「みたいに」 follows a **noun**, **verb (plain form)**, or **entire sentence**, it describes an action or state performed in a similar manner, or indicates an impression about the preceding statement. For example, 「鳥みたいに飛びたい」 (tori mitai ni tobitai) means \"I want to fly like a bird\". Here, 「みたいに」 functions like an adverb, modifying the verb or adjective that follows.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that 「みたい」 is an auxiliary adjective and should not be confused with 「見たい」 (mitai), which means \"want to see\". 「みたい」 itself does not have a kanji form and is always written in hiragana or katakana. This distinction is vital for accurate interpretation. While 「みたいだ」 is the plain form used at the end of a sentence to express an impression, 「みたいな」 modifies nouns, and 「みたいに」 modifies verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. The thing being described by 「みたいに」 or 「みたいな」 is not always directly adjacent to the particle, especially in longer sentences.",
