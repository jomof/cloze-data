jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: Used when observing a situation or someone's state and concluding that a certain outcome
    or characteristic is improbable.
  function: Expresses low probability, lack of indication, or unlikelihood based on observation or current
    circumstances.
  nuance: Implies a subjective judgment or a conclusion drawn from appearances. It is less definitive
    than 'impossible' but stronger than 'maybe not', often suggesting subtle disappointment or resignation.
etymology: The expression combines 「そう」(sō), meaning "appearance" or "seems like," which originates from
  「様」(yō) meaning "state" or "aspect," with the negative auxiliary 「ない」(nai). The particle 「に」(ni) functions
  adverbially, indicating "not in such a way that it appears." Thus, 「そうにない」 literally means "there is
  no appearance of [something happening/being true]." The optional 「も」(mo) in 「そうもない」 adds a nuance of
  emphasis or completeness to the negation, conveying "not at all appearing to be" or "no single sign
  of."
writeup: |-
  「そうにない」 and 「そうもない」 are grammatical expressions used to indicate that something is unlikely to happen or appear to be a certain way, based on observations or current circumstances. They are derived from the 「そう」(sō) form, which conveys appearance or conjecture, combined with 「ない」(nai) for negation. The particle 「に」(ni) functions adverbially, modifying the 「ない」, indicating "not in such a way that it seems." The version with 「も」 (「そうもない」) adds a slight emphasis, suggesting "not at all seeming to be" or "no single sign."

  This expression is less definitive than stating something is "impossible" (e.g., 「できない」 or 「はずがない」), but it conveys a strong sense of improbability. It is often used when you observe a situation or someone's behavior and conclude that a particular outcome is not on the horizon.

  For **verbs**, attach 「そうにない」 or 「そうもない」 to the `masu-stem` of the verb:
  *   Example: 「食べます」(tabemasu - to eat) → 「食べそうにない」 (tabesō ni nai - doesn't look like they'll eat / unlikely to eat)
  *   Example: 「行きます」(ikimasu - to go) → 「行きそうにない」 (ikisō ni nai - unlikely to go)

  For **い-adjectives**, remove the final 「い」 and attach 「そうにない」 or 「そうもない」:
  *   Example: 「美味しい」(oishii - delicious) → 「美味しそうにない」 (oishisō ni nai - doesn't look delicious / unlikely to be delicious)
  *   Example: 「忙しい」(isogashii - busy) → 「忙しそうにない」 (isogashisō ni nai - doesn't look busy / unlikely to be busy)

  For **な-adjectives** and **nouns**, the construction uses 「じゃなさそうにない」 or 「じゃなさそうもない」. This implies "doesn't seem to be [that adjective/noun]":
  *   Example: 「元気」(genki - healthy/energetic) → 「元気じゃなさそうにない」 (genki janasasō ni nai - doesn't look energetic / unlikely to be energetic)
  *   Example: 「学生」(gakusei - student) → 「学生じゃなさそうにない」 (gakusei janasasō ni nai - doesn't look like a student / unlikely to be a student)

  The key nuance is that the speaker is making a judgment based on external signs or the current situation, leading them to believe that the likelihood is low. It can sometimes imply a subtle disappointment or resignation.
false_friends:
  - term: だろう (conjecture)
    meaning: Probably not, likely not.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だろう」 indicates a general conjecture or prediction about something not happening, often based
      on general knowledge or common sense. 「そうにない」 emphasizes that the unlikelihood is based on observable
      signs or the current appearance of things, making it feel more grounded in immediate perception.
    grammar_point: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
  - term: はずがない (logical impossibility)
    meaning: There is no way, it's impossible, it shouldn't be.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はずがない」 indicates logical impossibility or something being absolutely contrary to what is
      expected, implying a much stronger certainty of non-occurrence. 「そうにない」 indicates unlikelihood based
      on appearance, but does not rule out the possibility entirely.
    grammar_point: はずがない (logical impossibility)
  - term: っこない (no chance of)
    meaning: No chance of, impossible, definitely not.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「っこない」 is a very strong, informal expression of absolute impossibility or certainty that something
      will not happen, often conveying the speaker's strong conviction or frustration. 「そうにない」 is softer
      and more about appearance-based unlikelihood.
    grammar_point: っこない (no chance of)
  - term: ようがない・ようもない (no way to)
    meaning: There's no way to, it's impossible to (do something).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようがない」 refers to the method or means of doing something being unavailable or impossible.
      「そうにない」 is about the general likelihood of something happening or being true.
    grammar_point: ようがない・ようもない (no way to)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「そうにない」 suggests something is unlikely based on its appearance, other
  expressions convey different shades of improbability or impossibility. 「だろう」 is a more general conjecture,
  simply stating "probably not" without necessarily relying on current observable signs. 「はずがない」 and 「っこない」
  both convey stronger certainty of non-occurrence or impossibility; 「はずがない」 often relies on logical reasoning,
  while 「っこない」 is a more emphatic and informal declaration of impossibility. Lastly, 「ようがない」 implies that
  the means to achieve something are absent, making it impossible to perform an action. Understanding
  these distinctions helps in choosing the most precise expression for the situation.

        english: There's no way we'll reach an agreement by the deadline.
        hint: 「はずがない」 implies logical impossibility or certainty, while 「そうもない」 suggests a strong unlikelihood

          signs point to low probability, not absolute impossibility.

    scene: During a design review meeting, commenting on a new product design that lacks aesthetic appeal.
    register: formal
