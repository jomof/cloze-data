  romaji: chūi suru
formation:
  Noun に + {注意する}: To pay attention to a specific noun or situation.

jlpt: N4
etymology: 'The term 注意 (chūi) is a compound of two kanji: 中 (chū), meaning ''middle'' or ''center'',
  and 意 (i), meaning ''mind'' or ''thought''. Thus, literally, it implies ''placing one''s mind in the
  center'' or ''focusing one''s mind''. This fundamental meaning has evolved to encompass ''paying attention'',
  ''being careful'', and by extension, ''warning'' or ''cautioning'' others to also direct their attention.'
writeup: |-
  注意する is a versatile verb with several important meanings, primarily encompassing 'to pay attention' or 'to be careful', and 'to warn' or 'to caution'. The specific nuance depends heavily on the personal context and the particles used.

  When used to mean **'to pay attention'** or **'to be careful'**, it often takes the particle 「に」 to indicate the object or situation one should be careful about. For instance, 「足元に注意する」 means 'to pay attention to one's step' or 'to be careful of one's footing'. This usage emphasizes vigilance and a proactive awareness of one's surroundings or actions. It implies a conscious effort to prevent mistakes or accidents.

  When used to mean **'to warn'** or **'to caution'** someone else, it can also take 「に」 to indicate the person being warned (e.g., 「子供に注意する」 - 'to warn/caution the child'). Alternatively, to specify the action one is being warned about, the structure 「Verb[dictionary] ように 注意する」 is common (e.g., 「遅刻しないように注意する」 - 'to caution someone not to be late'). In this sense, 注意する implies giving advice or a reminder about potential issues or improper behavior.

  Furthermore, 注意する can carry a nuance of **'to scold'** or **'to reprimand'** someone for a specific behavior. In this case, the particle 「を」 might be used to indicate the person or action being reprimanded (e.g., 「騒いでいる人を注意する」 - 'to scold the noisy person'). This usage is stronger than a mere reminder and implies correction of a wrongdoing.

  It is important to understand these distinctions to use 注意する appropriately in various situations, from simple daily reminders to more serious admonitions.
false_friends:
  - term: 気を付ける
    meaning: to be careful, to watch out
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both imply carefulness, 気を付ける emphasizes one's *own* internal vigilance or mental state
      of being careful. 注意する can mean being careful oneself, but it also readily extends to actively warning
      or scolding *others*. For example, you can say 「人に{注意する}」 (to warn a person), but not typically
      「人に気を付ける」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:気を付ける (to be careful)
  - term: 用心する
    meaning: to be cautious, to be on guard, to take precautions
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 用心する implies a stronger, more proactive sense of guarding against potential danger or misfortune,
      often with a sense of preparation. 注意する is a more general term for paying attention or giving a
      warning. You might 用心する against a thief, but you 注意する about a slippery floor.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:用心する (to be cautious・on guard)
  - term: 叱る
    meaning: to scold, to reprimand, to lecture
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 叱る specifically means to scold or reprimand someone for something they did wrong or inappropriately.
      While 注意する can have the nuance of scolding, it is generally milder and can also refer to simply
      drawing attention to something or being careful oneself. If someone made a severe mistake, you would
      叱る them; if they just forgot something minor, you might 注意する them.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:叱る (to scold)
  - term: 忠告する
    meaning: to advise, to counsel, to warn (as advice)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 忠告する means to give advice or counsel, often with the nuance of offering well-intentioned guidance,
      sometimes unsolicited. 注意する, while also meaning to warn, often implies a more direct instruction
      or a correction of behavior that is currently happening or might happen. 忠告 is advice; 注意 can be
      a direct warning or correction.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:忠告する (to advise)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 注意する from similar expressions, remember that 注意する covers
  both the act of being careful yourself and the act of warning or correcting others. 気を付ける focuses primarily
  on one's own carefulness. 用心する suggests a heightened state of caution against specific threats. 叱る is
  a direct and often stern reprimand for wrongdoing. 忠告する is about giving advice for someone's benefit.
  Understanding these subtle differences will help you choose the most appropriate verb for the situation.

        english: Please watch your steps.
        hint: While similar, 「気を付ける」 focuses more on the person's internal state of vigilance. We're looking
          for a more general 'pay attention' that can also imply a warning.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 足元 に 気 を つけ なさい。
        english: Be careful of your steps. (mild command)

        hint: Both are acceptable, but 「注意する」 here implies a conscious effort to observe oneself or the
          situation to prevent recurrence, which is slightly more active than just 'being careful' with
          「気を付ける」.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 二 度 と 同じ 間違い を 繰り返さ ない よう に 気 を つけ ます。

    scene: A detective recounting observations during an interrogation.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: This emphasizes the act of 'paying close attention' or 'noticing' details, which is another
      common usage of 「注意する」. The polite past tense indicates a completed action.
post_example_writeup: These examples demonstrate the range of contexts in which 注意する can be used, from
  personal mindfulness to direct communication of warnings or corrections. The appropriate particle usage
  (such as に for the object of attention, ように for an action to be cautious about, or を for the person/thing
  being scolded) is key to conveying the intended meaning.
