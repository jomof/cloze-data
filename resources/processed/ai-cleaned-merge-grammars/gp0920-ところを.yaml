        "usage-context": "Used to politely acknowledge someone's current state or situation when interrupting them, or to describe a precise moment when an action is taking place and is often interrupted.",
        "function": "Expresses apology or gratitude for interruption, or highlights a specific point of occurrence/interruption.",

        "temporal-flow": "concurrent with an action or state",
        "spatial-flow": "not applicable for this grammar point and its meaning, as it denotes a situation rather than physical space for motion verbs or physical objects in space for static location verbs or object verbs. It refers to a conceptual space (situation or state) rather than a physical space for objects or agents."
    },
    "etymology": "「ところ」 refers to a specific point in time or a situation. The particle 「を」 indicates the object of an action. Thus, 「ところを」 literally marks a situation which is being 'used' or 'affected' in some way, either by the speaker apologizing for intruding or by an event interrupting the ongoing situation.",
    "writeup": "「ところを」 combines the noun **ところ** (place, situation) with the particle **を**. This grammar construction expresses two primary meanings and is often used in formal contexts. Firstly, it conveys \"in spite of\" or \"regardless of\" a situation, typically employed to politely acknowledge someone's circumstances and express an apology for an interruption or gratitude for their efforts despite their situation. This nuance can follow verbs in their plain forms, い-adjectives, な-adjectives followed by な, or nouns followed by の.\n\nSecondly, 「ところを」 can mean \"when\" or \"while,\" focusing on an action that is in progress and is then interrupted. This usage primarily follows verbs in their plain forms. Both meanings can carry either positive or negative implications depending on the context. The particle **を** itself can sometimes be omitted without changing the core meaning.\n\nThis expression allows the speaker to acknowledge the specific state or action of another person, showing consideration and politeness when an interaction or event intrudes upon that state or action.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene depicts a professional interaction where high formality and deference are expected, especially from a subordinate to a supervisor. While 「休んでいる時に」 is grammatically valid, it lacks the specific nuance of acknowledging the listener's ongoing state and expressing a polite apology for interrupting that precise situation, which 「ところを」 inherently carries. The scene guides the learner towards this higher degree of politeness."

                    "competing_grammar": "休憩中に申し訳ありませんが",
                    "mitigation": "「休憩中に」 is more general, referring to the entire duration of a break rather than the specific moment of being 'in the act' of resting. The scene prompts the use of 「ところを」 for its precision in highlighting the exact state being interrupted."

This phrasing is common in business communication when interrupting someone's private time."
