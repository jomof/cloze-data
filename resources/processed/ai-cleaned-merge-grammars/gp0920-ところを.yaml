    "writeup": "「ところを」 combines the noun **ところ** (place, situation) with the particle **を**. This grammar construction expresses two primary meanings. Firstly, it conveys \"in spite of\" or \"regardless of\" a situation, typically used to politely acknowledge someone's circumstances and apologize for an interruption. This nuance can follow verbs in their plain forms, い-adjectives, な-adjectives followed by な, or nouns followed by の. Secondly, it can mean \"when\" or \"while,\" focusing on an action that is interrupted. This usage primarily follows verbs in their plain forms. Both meanings can have positive or negative implications depending on the context, and the particle **を** can sometimes be omitted. It is considered formal.",
    "etymology": "「ところ」 refers to a specific point in time or a situation. The particle 「を」 indicates the object of an action. Thus, 「ところを」 literally marks a situation which is being 'used' or 'affected' in some way, either by the speaker apologizing for intruding or by an event interrupting the ongoing situation.",
