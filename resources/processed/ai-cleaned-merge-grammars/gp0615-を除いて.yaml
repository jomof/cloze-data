    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the verb 「除く (のぞく)」, meaning \"to remove, exclude.\" The 「を」 particle indicates the object being excluded, and the 「て」-form of the verb connects it to the main clause, indicating a state or condition resulting from the exclusion.",
    "writeup": "「を除いて」 is a formal grammar structure used to indicate an exception. It combines 「を」 and the te-form of the verb 「除く (のぞく)」, meaning \"to exclude.\" It is similar to 「以外」 but more formal and often found in writing, signs, and formal speech. The pattern means \"except for (A), (B),\" \"with the exception of (A), (B),\" or \"excluding (A), (B).\" The standard form (dictionary form) can be used to directly modify a noun.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「はともかく」 and 「以外」 can express exclusion, it's important to note their specific nuances. Use 「はともかく」 when you want to set aside one thing to focus on something else. Use 「以外」 for general exclusions in less formal contexts, while 「を除いて」 is more suited for formal situations requiring a more precise exclusion.",
