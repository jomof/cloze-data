    "etymology": "The origin of 「つい」 is somewhat debated, but it is often linked to the idea of a momentary lapse or yielding to a sudden impulse. It carries the sense of something happening almost instantaneously or without conscious effort.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「つい」 is used to describe actions done unintentionally, unconsciously, or against one's better judgment. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence and is frequently paired with 「てしまう」 to emphasize the unintentional nature of the action. It expresses a momentary lapse or yielding to impulse, similar to the English word \"lapse.\" This often implies a lack of foresight or an inability to control one's own actions, even when one knows better. It is gender neutral and age-independent.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「つい」, 「いつの間にか」 indicates that something happened gradually or without one's awareness over a period of time. It implies a change that went unnoticed until it was complete."

            "meaning": "carelessly, inadvertently",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「つい」, 「うっかり」 suggests a momentary lapse in attention or a mistake due to carelessness. While both imply unintentionality, 「うっかり」 focuses more on a lack of attention, whereas 「つい」 emphasizes an impulse or an inability to resist."

            "nuance": "While similar to 「つい」, 「思わず」 emphasizes a more immediate, reflexive reaction, often triggered by a specific stimulus. It implies an action that happens without conscious thought or control, often as a direct response to something."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「つい」, 「いつの間にか」, 「うっかり」, and 「思わず」 all relate to actions done unintentionally, they each have slightly different nuances. 「つい」 emphasizes acting on impulse or against better judgment, or refers to a very recent past. 「いつの間にか」 highlights gradual changes or unnoticed events over time. 「うっかり」 suggests a careless mistake or oversight due to lack of attention. 「思わず」 focuses on reflexive reactions made without conscious thought. Being mindful of these differences will lead to more accurate and natural expression.",
