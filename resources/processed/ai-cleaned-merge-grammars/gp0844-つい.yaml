    },
    "formation": {
        "つい + Verb": "Indicates an action done unintentionally, unconsciously, or against one's better judgment, often implying a momentary lapse.",

        "usage-context": "Generally used in everyday situations."
    },
    "etymology": "The origin of 「つい」 is somewhat debated, but it is often linked to the idea of a momentary lapse or yielding to a sudden impulse. It carries the sense of something happening almost instantaneously or without conscious effort.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「つい」 is used to describe actions done unintentionally, unconsciously, or against one's better judgment. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence and is frequently paired with 「てしまう」 to emphasize the unintentional nature of the action. It expresses a momentary lapse or yielding to impulse, similar to the English word \"lapse.\" This often implies a lack of foresight or an inability to control one's own actions, even when one knows better. It is gender neutral and age-independent.",
