    "etymology": "The origin of 「つい」 is somewhat debated, but it is often linked to the idea of a momentary lapse or yielding to a sudden impulse. It carries the sense of something happening almost instantaneously or without conscious effort.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「つい」 is used to describe actions done unintentionally, unconsciously, or against one's better judgment. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence and is frequently paired with 「てしまう」 to emphasize the unintentional nature of the action. It expresses a momentary lapse or yielding to impulse, similar to the English word \"lapse.\" This often implies a lack of foresight or an inability to control one's own actions, even when one knows better. It is gender neutral and age-independent.",

    "change": [
        "Violation: Removed the `conjugations` field. Reason: Rule 0 states this field should only be present if the grammar point is a verb or adjective in dictionary form, which `つい` (an adverb) is not.",

        "Unnatural: Added a sentence about \"lapse\" to the `writeup`. Reason: To explicitly connect the concept of \"lapse\" which is mentioned in the Bunpro input's writeup, enhancing clarity.",
        "Violation: Removed surrounding quotes from the example sentences: `{つい} 連絡しちゃった。あ、ごめんね、迷惑だったかな？` and `私も{つい} そう言っちゃった。`. Reason: Rule 10 states, \"Strongly prefer not using quotes. Reserve them for when the grammar point needs them.\" These quotes were used for dialogue formatting, which is also explicitly disallowed by rule 9.",
        "Unnatural: Added a new example sentence for the temporal meaning of `つい`. Reason: The prior examples focused solely on the \"unintentional/impulsive\" meaning. Adding an example like `{つい} さっきまでここにいたはずなのに、もう誰もいない。` demonstrates the other primary usage of `つい` (closeness in time/space) as identified in DOJG, making the grammar point's explanation more comprehensive.",
        "Violation: Retained the `false_friends` list from the prior version (`いつの間にか`, `うっかり`, `思わず`) and did not include `てしまう・ちゃう` as suggested by the new input. Reason: Rule 14 specifies that false friends \"MUST NOT be a conjugation of the current grammar point.\" While `てしまう` is not a conjugation of `つい`, it is a common grammatical pairing that functions as a suffix to a main verb, often used *with* `つい`, rather than a term that is typically confused *for* `つい` itself. The prior version's false friends are distinct adverbs that are more genuinely confused with `つい` due to overlapping meanings of unintentionality."
