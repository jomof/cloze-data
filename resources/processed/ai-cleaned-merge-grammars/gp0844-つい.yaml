    "meaning": "accidentally, unconsciously, against one's better judgement",
    "meaning_warning": "Usually appears with 「てしまう」",
    "pronunciation": {
        "katakana": "ツイ",
        "romaji": "tsui"
    },
    "formation": {
        "つい + Verb": "Indicates an action done unintentionally, unconsciously, or against one's better judgment, often implying a momentary lapse.",
        "つい + 時を表す言葉 (time expression)": "Indicates something happened just recently or a very short time ago."

    },
    "etymology": "The origin of 「つい」 is somewhat debated, but it is often linked to the idea of a momentary lapse or yielding to a sudden impulse. It carries the sense of something happening almost instantaneously or without conscious effort.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「つい」 is used to describe actions done unintentionally, unconsciously, or against one's better judgment. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence and is frequently paired with 「てしまう」 to emphasize the unintentional nature of the action. It expresses a momentary lapse or yielding to impulse, similar to the English word \"lapse.\" This often implies a lack of foresight or an inability to control one's own actions, even when one knows better. It is gender neutral and age-independent.",

        {
            "japanese": "目の前にケーキがあったから、{つい} 食べてしまった。",
            "english": "There was a cake right in front of me, so I ate it without thinking.",
            "scene": "Explaining why you ate cake when you're not supposed to.",

                    "competing_grammar": "うっかり 食べてしまった",
                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes the 'without thinking' / 'against better judgment' aspect, rather than mere carelessness. 「つい」 implies an internal struggle or impulse, while 「うっかり」 is more about a simple mistake due to lack of attention. The setup focuses on the temptation (cake being right there) rather than a simple oversight."

                    "competing_grammar": "思わず 食べてしまった",
                    "mitigation": "While similar, 「思わず」 often implies an immediate, reflexive, almost physical reaction. 「つい」 implies more of a yielding to impulse or weakness. The scene of 'explaining why you ate it when you're not supposed to' leans more towards the internal struggle and lack of control implied by 「つい」."

                    "mitigation": "While 「思わず」 could also fit for a reflexive laugh, 「つい」 suggests a recurring, perhaps embarrassing habit that the speaker finds hard to control, even though they know it's inappropriate. The 'student talking about their reaction' implies a pattern rather than a one-off immediate reflex."
