grammar_point: お〜ください (polite request)
learn_before:
  - '[Noun]をください (please give me)'
  - お (honorific prefix)
  - ご (honorific prefix for Sino-Japanese words)
id: gp0384
meaning: Polite request; Please do (honorific)
pronunciation:
  katakana: オ・クダサイ
  romaji: o kudasai
formation:
  お + Verb[ます-stem] + ください: Used with most Japanese verbs.
  ご + Noun + ください: Used with Sino-Japanese verbs (noun + する).
jlpt: N3
etymology: The honorific prefix 「お」 comes from 「大」(ō), meaning 'great' or 'large,' which evolved to show
  respect. 「ください」 is the imperative form of 「くださる」(kudasaru), the respectful equivalent of 「くれる」(kureru,
  'to give to me/us/in-group'). Thus, 「お〜ください」 literally means 'please respectfully give (the action),'
  signifying a request made with deference.
writeup: This grammar point, 「お〜ください」, is used to make polite requests or give instructions. It is a more
  formal and respectful alternative to the common 「〜てください」 form. The 「お」 prefix is an honorific marker
  attached to the ます-stem of most Japanese verbs, followed by 「ください」. This construction elevates the politeness
  of the request, making it suitable for situations where you need to show deference to the listener,
  such as in customer service, formal business settings, or public announcements. The structure typically
  involves adding 「お」 to the ます-stem of verbs (e.g. 読みます → お読みください). For Sino-Japanese verbs (verbs formed
  from a noun + する, like 連絡する or 利用する), 「ご」 is often used instead of 「お」, placed before the noun part
  of the verb (e.g. ご連絡ください, ご利用ください). However, some Sino-Japanese verbs or verbs that describe actions
  performed by the speaker for the benefit of the listener, might still take 「お」 (e.g. お待ちください). 「お〜ください」
  implies that the requested action is either for the listener's benefit or is an action they are expected
  to perform out of respect or duty. It is less of a direct command and more of a polite directive or
  invitation to act. It is commonly seen on signs, in announcements, or when a service person addresses
  a client.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜てください
    meaning: Please do (polite, general)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: お〜ください is more formal and shows higher respect to the listener than 〜てください. 〜てください is a general
      polite request suitable for most everyday situations, while お〜ください is reserved for more formal contexts
      or when addressing those of higher social standing.
    grammar_point: てください (polite request)
  - term: 〜なさい
    meaning: Do (polite imperative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 〜なさい is also a polite imperative, it is typically used by a superior to a subordinate
      (e.g. parent to child, teacher to student) and carries a tone of mild command or advice. お〜ください
      is used when the speaker wishes to show respect to the listener, regardless of status, or to maintain
      high formality. It is generally perceived as softer than 〜なさい.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]なさい (polite imperative)'
  - term: 〜ていただけませんか
    meaning: Would you please do (humble request)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: お〜ください focuses on the speaker's politeness and respect towards the listener in making the
      request. 〜ていただけませんか emphasizes the speaker's humility and gratitude for the listener's potential
      action, implying a favor being done for the speaker. It is often used when explicitly asking for
      help or a specific action that benefits the speaker.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]いただけませんか (humble request)'
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between お〜ください, 〜てください, 〜なさい, and 〜ていただけませんか, consider the social
  context and your relationship with the listener. お〜ください is ideal for formal settings and showing general
  respect. 〜てください is the standard polite request for everyday interactions. 〜なさい conveys a gentle command
  from a higher-status individual. For situations requiring even greater humility and deference, especially
  when asking for a favor, 〜ていただけませんか is more appropriate. Understanding these subtle differences will
  greatly enhance the naturalness of your Japanese communication.

  on the type of verb. Generally, 「お」 is used with Japanese-origin verbs (和語, wago), while 「ご」 is used
  with Sino-Japanese verbs (漢語, kango). Mastering this distinction is key to using this polite request
  form correctly and naturally in various formal and service-oriented contexts.
