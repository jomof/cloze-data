    },
    "etymology": "The literal meaning of 「一体 (いったい)」 is \"one body\" or \"one form.\" The nuance here is to suggest a desire for a unified or coherent understanding of a situation. By using 「一体」, the speaker is essentially asking, \"In a way that can be understood as a single, coherent whole, what is going on?\"",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「一体 (いったい)」 is used to express surprise, doubt, or strong emphasis, often in the context of a question. It conveys a feeling of \"what the heck,\" \"who in the world,\" \"where on earth,\" or even stronger expressions like \"how f*ing many.\" 「一体」 typically appears at the beginning of a sentence, before a question word (like 何, 誰, どこ, なんで, いつ, いくら) to emphasize the speaker's disbelief or shock. While 「一体」 can be written in kanji, it is frequently written in hiragana. The literal meaning of 「一体」 is 'one body', or 'one form'. In this way, when paired with questions, 「一体」 can be thought of meaning 'in a way that can be understood, what is (A)', or 'in a way that makes sense, what is (A)'. As a fun fact, like the 'one body', or 'one form' meaning mentioned above, 「一体」 is sometimes used to mean 'in general', or 'generally' when seen as 「一体に」. However, this use is slowly becoming less common, partly due to how often 「一体」 is used simply to express surprise or shock.",
    "examples": [
        {

            "english": "What on earth is this?",
            "english_literally": "This, on earth, what is it?",
            "scene": "A child finds a strange, unidentifiable object on the floor.",
            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "interrogative",
            "nuance": "The English 'on earth' captures the sense of mild surprise or wonder that 「一体」 adds to a simple question. This is a common and straightforward use of the grammar point.",
            "etymology": "The phrase 「何 ですか」 is a standard polite way to ask 'what is it?'. 「一体」 here intensifies the question with a sense of 'on earth' or 'what in the world?'"

            "speaker_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "The use of 「一体」 emphasizes the speaker's disbelief and strong desire to understand the profound reason behind the action. The casual ending 「の」 (used in questions) adds a softening tone, which can be characteristic of female speech in informal conversations.",
            "etymology": "「どうして」 is a common way to ask 'why'. Adding 「一体」 before it intensifies the inquiry, expressing a strong sense of bewilderment or frustration. 「嘘をつく (うそをつく)」 means 'to tell a lie'."

            "etymology": "「誰 (だれ)」 means 'who'. The combination with 「一体」 creates an emphatic 'who in the world?'. 「大変 (たいへん) な 仕事 (しごと)」 refers to a 'difficult task'."

            "nuance": "The use of 「一体」 here emphasizes the speaker's mounting impatience and frustration. The ending 「んだろう」 suggests a rhetorical or exasperated internal question, often used by male speakers in casual situations.",
            "etymology": "「いつ」 means 'when'. 「到着 (とうちゃく) する」 means 'to arrive'. The combination with 「一体」 indicates a strong sense of impatience or exasperation about the unknown arrival time."

            "nuance": "The phrase 「一体どこに」 highlights the speaker's complete bewilderment and frustration with the lack of space. The casual ending 「んだよ」 adds a strong, slightly exasperated tone, typical of male casual speech when expressing a rhetorical question or complaint.",
            "etymology": "「どこ」 means 'where'. 「荷物 (にもつ)」 means 'luggage'. 「置く (おく)」 means 'to put'. The combination with 「一体」 conveys a desperate or rhetorical 'where on earth?'"

            "etymology": "「理解 (りかい) できない」 means 'cannot understand'. The addition of 「一体」 before it strengthens the inability to comprehend, implying a sense of 'how on earth can I understand?' or 'it's utterly impossible to understand'."

            "etymology": "「問題 (もんだい) を 解く (とく)」 means 'to solve a problem'. 「どう すれば いい」 means 'what should I do'. 「一体」 here conveys a profound sense of perplexity regarding how to approach the solution."

            "nuance": "In a professional setting, 「一体」 is used here not just to ask a question, but to emphasize the critical and fundamental nature of the company's purpose. It implies that the current understanding of the purpose is either fundamentally flawed or entirely forgotten, urging a serious re-evaluation.",
            "etymology": "「目的 (もくてき)」 means 'purpose'. 「話し合う (はなしあう)」 means 'to discuss with each other'. The use of 「一体」 underscores the speaker's strong belief that the company's core mission is either unclear or has been entirely lost, prompting a critical re-evaluation."
