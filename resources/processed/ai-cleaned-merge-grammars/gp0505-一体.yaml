    },
    "etymology": "The literal meaning of 「一体 (いったい)」 is \"one body\" or \"one form.\" The nuance here is to suggest a desire for a unified or coherent understanding of a situation. By using 「一体」, the speaker is essentially asking, \"In a way that can be understood as a single, coherent whole, what is going on?\"",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「一体 (いったい)」 is used to express surprise, doubt, or strong emphasis, often in the context of a question. It conveys a feeling of \"what the heck,\" \"who in the world,\" \"where on earth,\" or even stronger expressions like \"how f*ing many.\" 「一体」 typically appears at the beginning of a sentence, before a question word (like 何, 誰, どこ, なんで, いつ, いくら) to emphasize the speaker's disbelief or shock. While 「一体」 can be written in kanji, it is frequently written in hiragana. The literal meaning of 「一体」 is 'one body', or 'one form'. In this way, when paired with questions, 「一体」 can be thought of meaning 'in a way that can be understood, what is (A)', or 'in a way that makes sense, what is (A)'. As a fun fact, like the 'one body', or 'one form' meaning mentioned above, 「一体」 is sometimes used to mean 'in general', or 'generally' when seen as 「一体に」. However, this use is slowly becoming less common, partly due to how often 「一体」 is used simply to express surprise or shock.",
