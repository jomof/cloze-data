    "etymology": "The literal meaning of 「一体 (いったい)」 is \"one body\" or \"one form.\" The nuance here is to suggest a desire for a unified or coherent understanding of a situation. By using 「一体」, the speaker is essentially asking, \"In a way that can be understood as a single, coherent whole, what is going on?\"",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「一体 (いったい)」 is used to express surprise, doubt, or strong emphasis, often in the context of a question. It conveys a feeling of \"what the heck,\" \"who in the world,\" \"where on earth,\" or even stronger expressions like \"how f*ing many.\" 「一体」 typically appears at the beginning of a sentence, before a question word (like 何, 誰, どこ, なんで, いつ, いくら) to emphasize the speaker's disbelief or shock. While 「一体」 can be written in kanji, it is frequently written in hiragana.",

            "setting": "serious",
            "nuance": "「どういうことだ」 is a fairly direct way of asking for an explanation. Using 「一体」 makes the inquiry sharper, implying some disbelief."
