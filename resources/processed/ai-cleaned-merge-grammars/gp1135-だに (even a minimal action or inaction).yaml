formation:
  Verb (dictionary form) + だに: Expresses a feeling or thought triggered by merely performing the verb.
    This often implies a strong emotion, such as fear, disgust, or embarrassment, but can also convey
    envy or admiration.
  Noun + だに + しない: Indicates a complete absence of an action or consideration on the part of the subject,
    suggesting that they don't even bother to do something.

details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: formal
  particle-syntactic-function: adverbializer
  particle-pragmatic-function: emphasis
  function: Emphasizes that a minimal action or thought is sufficient to evoke a strong feeling, or highlights
    a complete lack of action or consideration.
  nuance: 「だに」 imparts a strong, often literary, tone. When used with verbs, it intensifies the emotional
    impact of the act of merely doing or thinking something. When paired with 「～しない」, it underscores an
    absolute absence of action, often implying negligence or extreme indifference. It is far more formal
    and less common in daily conversation than similar expressions.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a correlative particle, linking the preceding minimal action or thought
    to a subsequent emotional or behavioral outcome.
etymology: The particle 「だに」 is believed to have originated from classical Japanese. While its exact etymology
  is debated, one theory suggests it evolved from a combination of 「だ」 (a form of the copula) and 「に」
  (a particle indicating location or direction). Over time, it developed its unique function of emphasizing
  an extreme condition or the minimal threshold for something to occur. Its usage is rooted in older literary
  forms and retains a formal, sometimes archaic, flavor.
writeup: 'The particle 「だに」 is a sophisticated grammatical element primarily found in formal writing and
  elevated speech. It serves two main functions: either to express that merely thinking about or performing
  an action is enough to trigger a profound emotional response, or to emphasize a complete absence of
  an action, even a very minor one.When combined with a verb in its dictionary form (e.g., 「思うだに」, 「考えるだに」),
  「だに」 signifies that ''just'' or ''merely'' engaging in that action is sufficient to produce a strong
  feeling. This feeling is often negative, such as fear (恐ろしい), embarrassment (恥ずかしい), or disgust (嫌悪感),
  but it can also convey strong envy (羨ましい) or admiration. It highlights the intensity of the emotion
  relative to the simplicity of the trigger.Conversely, when 「だに」 is used in the negative form 「～だにしない」,
  it emphasizes that the subject ''doesn''t even'' perform a certain action. This construction implies
  an absolute lack of action or consideration, often suggesting indifference, neglect, or an unexpected
  omission. For example, 「注意だにしない」 means ''doesn''t even pay attention'' or ''doesn''t even warn''. This
  usage stresses the extreme degree of inaction. Because of its formal and somewhat archaic nature, 「だに」
  is generally not used in casual conversation.'

  - term: だけでも
    meaning: just by doing/thinking X; even if only X
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だけでも」 is more common and less formal than 「だに」. While both can express 'just by doing X',
      「だに」 often implies a more profound or overwhelming emotional response, or a more absolute lack of
      action in negative constructions. 「だけでも」 simply states a minimal condition or result without the
      strong emotional or literary overtone.
    grammar_point: だけで (just by)
  - term: さえ
    meaning: even; moreover
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「さえ」 also means 'even', but it typically emphasizes an extreme example or surprise, indicating
      that something applies *even to* a case that might be unexpected. 「だに」, on the other hand, focuses
      on the *minimal* action or thought sufficient to trigger a strong feeling, or the absolute absence
      of *any* action (in negative forms), often carrying a more literary or dramatic nuance.
    grammar_point: さえ (even・if only)
  - term: すら
    meaning: even; (not) even
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「すら」 is similar to 「さえ」 in meaning 'even', but it is generally more formal and often used
      to express a negative or critical nuance, implying an extreme or surprising lack. While both can
      be used in negative contexts (e.g., 「すらしない」 vs. 「だにしない」), 「だに」 often carries a more archaic or literary
      feel, particularly emphasizing a fundamental or shocking absence of action or consideration.
    grammar_point: すら (even)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between 「だに」 and its close counterparts, consider the level
  of formality and the depth of emphasis. 「だに」 elevates the expression, adding a literary and dramatic
  quality to the idea of 'just' or 'not even'. If you want to convey a profound emotional reaction to
  a minimal stimulus, or an absolute, almost scandalous, lack of action or consideration, 「だに」 is often
  the most impactful choice. For more straightforward statements of 'even' or 'just by', 「さえ」, 「すら」, or
  「だけでも」 are more commonly used and less formal.

        english: Even just by recalling an embarrassing mistake from high school, my face turns red.
        hint: The sudden, intense emotional response suggested by the scene is better captured by a direct
          emphasis over the slightly softened 「だけでも」.
    scene: A person is lying in bed late at night, trying to sleep, but a memory from their youth suddenly

        english: Even just by thinking my friend is enjoying a tropical country, I get envious.
        hint: The intensity of the envy and the contrast with the speaker's own situation are better highlighted
          by a direct emphasis compared to the more neutral 「だけでも」.
    scene: A man is working hard in his office during a hot summer, looking at a photo of his friend on
      a beach, feeling a pang of jealousy.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「考えるだに」 emphasizes that the speaker doesn't need to experience the vacation directly;

        english: The section chief didn't even give a single thought to my opinion.

        english: The section chief didn't even give a single thought to my opinion, implying a critical
          judgment.
        hint: This sentence implies an extreme or surprising lack, but the scene emphasizes a profound,

        hint: The scene describes unwavering determination in the face of significant adversity, which

        english: No matter what difficulties he faced, his resolve didn't even waver an inch.

      silent, not even crying out.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: cautious

    scene: A person woke up feeling utterly exhausted after a long week, and the mere thought of moving
      feels like an insurmountable task.
    register: casual

    nuance: While 「だに」 is formal, in this context 「出るだに億劫だ」 is used to hyperbolically express extreme

          - 彼 は その 美しい 景色 を 一瞥 {すら} し なかっ た。
        english: He didn't even cast a glance at the beautiful scenery (with a critical nuance).

    scene: A person is watching a documentary about a humanitarian crisis, feeling deep empathy for the
      victims.
    register: formal
    setting: sympathetic
    nuance: 「想像するだに」 conveys a deep level of empathy, indicating that the mere act of imagining the suffering

    scene: A woman has just received devastating news. Despite efforts from her friends to console her,
      she remains expressionless, her face showing no hint of a smile.

      was so affected that she couldn't even manage the slightest, most basic expression of a smile, indicating
      a profound state of emotional numbness or sorrow.

      - competing_japanese:
          - あれ ほど 助け て もらっ た の に、彼 は 感謝 の 言葉 {さえ} 述べ なかっ た。
        english: Despite receiving so much help, he didn't even express a word of gratitude.
        hint: While 「さえ」 emphasizes the surprising omission of gratitude, 「だに」 conveys a deeper sense
          of disappointment or criticism for this specific lack of common courtesy.

        english: Despite receiving so much help, he didn't even express a word of gratitude (with a critical
          nuance).
        hint: 「すら」 emphasizes a shocking lack, often with a critical undertone. 「だに」 further deepens this
          criticism, suggesting an almost unimaginable absence of basic thanks.
    scene: After a large project was completed thanks to significant support from colleagues, one team
      member failed to acknowledge any of the help they received during the celebratory dinner.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「言葉だに述べなかった」 conveys strong disappointment or criticism. It implies that despite
      receiving substantial assistance, the person did not even offer the minimal gesture of a thank you,
      highlighting their perceived lack of gratitude.
post_example_writeup: 「だに」 is a highly nuanced particle that lends a sophisticated and often dramatic
  tone to sentences. While its core meaning is 'just' or 'even', its choice over similar expressions like
  「だけでも」 or 「さえ」 signals a stronger emotional impact or a more absolute negation. It often appears in
  contexts that describe a deep psychological state or an extreme level of inaction, making it a powerful
  tool for conveying profound sentiments or strong criticisms.
