    "etymology": "The word 「どんどん」 is an onomatopoeia (擬音語), specifically a giongo (擬音語), representing the sound of something being struck repeatedly or heavily, like a drum. It conveys a sense of rapid, continuous action or increase.",
    "writeup": "「どんどん」 (or ドンドン) is an onomatopoeic expression (オノマトペ) that conveys a sense of rapid, continuous action or increase. It mimics the sound of banging or pounding, like a drum or footsteps, which gives it the meaning of \"rapidly\" or \"quickly.\" \n\n「どんどん」 is used to describe **swift and accelerating change or progress**. This is its key distinction from 「だんだん」, which describes a more gradual, step-by-step change. While both can express a progression, 「どんどん」 emphasizes the speed and intensity of that progression. \n\nLike many adverbs and onomatopoeic words in Japanese, 「どんどん」 can optionally be followed by the particle 「と」. However, it is very common for 「と」 to be omitted in everyday usage, especially in casual speech.",
