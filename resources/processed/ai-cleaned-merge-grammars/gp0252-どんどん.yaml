    "etymology": "The word 「どんどん」 is an onomatopoeia, imitating the sound of something being struck repeatedly, like a drum. This sound-image extends to describe things happening in quick succession or intensifying rapidly.",
    "writeup": "「どんどん」 (or ドンドン) is an onomatopoeic word (オノマトペ) representing a particular sound or sensation. It mimics the sound of banging (like on a drum) or the pounding of feet. Therefore, it is often translated as \"rapidly\" or \"quickly.\" Like 「だんだん」, 「どんどん」 can be used before many phrases to describe how something rapidly accelerates. While 「どんどん」 can take the particle 「と」, it's often omitted in modern Japanese.",
