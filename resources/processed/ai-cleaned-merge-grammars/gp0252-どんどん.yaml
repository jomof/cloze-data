    "etymology": "The word 「どんどん」 is an onomatopoeia (擬音語), specifically a giongo (擬音語), representing the sound of something being struck repeatedly or heavily, like a drum. It conveys a sense of rapid, continuous action or increase.",
    "writeup": "「どんどん」 is an onomatopoeic expression (オノマトペ) representing a sound or sensation. It mimics the sound of something banging or pounding, like a drum or footsteps. Thus, it's often translated as \"rapidly\" or \"quickly.\" It describes **swift and accelerating change**, unlike 「だんだん」, which describes a more gradual change. While 「どんどん」 can be used with the particle 「と」, it's often omitted, which is common with adverbs and onomatopoeic words in Japanese.",
