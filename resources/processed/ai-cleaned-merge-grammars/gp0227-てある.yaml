    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てある」 is a combination of the te-form of a verb and the verb 「ある」 (aru), meaning \"to exist\" or \"to be\". The te-form indicates a completed action, and 「ある」 signifies the resulting state of that action.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てある」 expresses a state that is the result of a previous action. It is similar to 「ている」 but with some key differences. First, 「てある」 is used **only with transitive verbs**. Second, the focus is on the **object** that has been acted upon, rather than the person or thing that performed the action. Because 「ある」 is used, it implies that the object is inanimate or unable to undo the action done to it.\n\nIt's often translated as \"something has been done\" or \"something is in a state of having been done\". When the action involves preparation, 「が」 may mark the object. Otherwise, 「を」 is typically preferred.",
