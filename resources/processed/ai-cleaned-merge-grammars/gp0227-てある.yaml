    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てある」 combines the -te form of a transitive verb with the verb 「ある」 (aru), which means \"to be\" or \"to exist\" (for inanimate objects). The -te form indicates a completed action, and 「ある」 signifies the resulting state of that action.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てある」 indicates that an action has been done to something, and the resulting state of that action remains. It's **important** to remember that 「てある」 is only used with **transitive verbs**. It highlights the object of the verb as being in a certain state as a result of someone's action.\n\nWhile similar to 「ている」, 「てある」 focuses on the *resultant state* of an action performed on an inanimate object, rather than the action itself. In sentences using 「てある」, 「が」 often marks the object when the action involves preparation. For actions without significant preparation, 「を」 is preferred.",
