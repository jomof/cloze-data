    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てある」 is a combination of the te-form of a verb and the verb 「ある」 (aru), meaning \"to exist\" or \"to be\". The te-form indicates a completed action, and 「ある」 signifies the resulting state of that action. This construction emphasizes the continued existence of the result of a purposeful action.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てある」 describes a **state** that is the result of a prior action. It is crucial to understand that it is used **only with transitive verbs** and places emphasis on the **object** that has been acted upon, rather than the person or entity who performed the action. The use of 「ある」 (aru) signifies the continued existence of this state, implying that the object is inanimate or cannot undo the action.\n\nWhile often translated simply as \"something has been done\" or \"something is in a state of having been done,\" 「てある」 frequently carries the nuance that the action was performed with a **purpose** or in **preparation** for something else.\n\nConsider the particles used with 「てある」:\n*   **Object が + てある**: This form is typically used when the action involves some kind of preparation or an ongoing intended state. For example, setting up a room for a party. The focus is on the object and its current state as a result of that preparation.\n*   **Object を + てある**: This form is used for more direct actions that don't necessarily imply extensive preparation but still result in a state. For example, opening a window and leaving it open. The distinction between が and を can be subtle and context-dependent, but generally, が is preferred when the result is a significant or preparatory state, while を is used for simple resultant states.",
