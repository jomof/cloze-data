        "Usage": "This phrase often implies a sense of surprise or unexpectedness. It's used to describe deviations from the norm, whether in behavior, emotions, or environmental conditions.",

    "etymology": "The phrase 「に(も)なく」 combines 「に」 (a particle indicating state or condition), 「も」 (an emphatic particle), and 「なく」 (the negative form of 「ある」 - to be). It suggests that something is 'not in the usual state' or 'not as it typically is,' hence its meaning of 'unusually' or 'more than usual'.",

It indicates that something or someone is behaving or appearing differently than usual. The 「も」 is optional but often included for added emphasis. For example, 「いつにもなく」 means \"more than usual\". It's commonly used to describe personal observations, feelings, or unexpected changes. It can be used in various registers, but it's often found in narrative or descriptive contexts.",
