  Adverbial Usage: '[再び] + Verb/Verb Phrase: Placed before a verb or verb phrase to indicate a repetition
    of an action'
jlpt: N3
etymology: The term 「再び」 is derived from 「二度 (にど)」, meaning "twice" or "a second time," with the 「び」 acting
  as a suffix indicating frequency or repetition. Over time, 「再び」 evolved to specifically denote something
  happening for the second time.
writeup: 「再び」 is an adverb that means "to repeat". It is typically translated as "again," "once more,"
  or "a second time." While it often appears at the beginning of a sentence, it can also be placed before
  the verb or clause it modifies.Despite meaning "to repeat," 「再び」 has the nuance of repeating something
  specifically "for the second time." Because of this, it is not used to highlight things that needs to
  be repeated over and over again.Unlike 「また」, which is frequently used to express "again," 「再び」 is quite
  formal and is more often seen in books or articles than in casual spoken language.

  - term: 更に (even more)
    meaning: Again, even more, furthermore, in addition.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「再び」 which denotes a distinct reoccurrence or 'second time', 「更に」 implies an incremental
      increase, addition, or continuation beyond the current state, often meaning 'moreover' or 'further'.

  - term: また (again; also; or)
    meaning: Again; also; moreover; in addition.
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「また」 is a general term for "again" and is used in a wide range of contexts, including simple
      repetition or adding items. 「再び」 is more formal and specifically implies a second occurrence after
      a distinct pause or significant event.
    grammar_point: また (again; also; or)
  - term: 二度と (never again)
    meaning: Never again; no more.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「再び」 signifies a reoccurrence, 「二度と」 is used exclusively with negative verbs to express
      that something will definitively not happen again, emphasizing a finality to the absence of repetition.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:二度と (never again)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「再び」 is best used for situations where something
  is happening for a second time, and its formality makes it more suitable for written or formal spoken
  contexts. 「また」 is more versatile for everyday use when simply indicating repetition. 「更に」 indicates
  additional increase.
