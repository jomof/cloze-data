    "details": {
        "Register": "Formal; commonly used in business settings.",
        "Usage": "Used to express a polite request or wish, often in formal situations or when addressing superiors.",

    "etymology": "The verb 「願う(ねがう)」 originates from the noun 「願い(ねがい)」, which means \"wish\" or \"request.\" The kanji 「願」 combines the elements 「頁」 (head) and 「原」 (source), suggesting the idea of expressing one's desires or thoughts from the core of one's being. Over time, it evolved into a verb to express the act of wishing or requesting something.",
    "writeup": "「願う・願います」 is a versatile verb with meanings ranging from wishing and hoping to requesting and praying. It is commonly used to make polite requests, especially in formal or business settings. The 「ます」 form, 「願います」, adds a level of politeness suitable for addressing superiors or customers.\n\n**Key usages:**\n*   **Polite requests:** Often used with the 「お～ください」 or 「ご～ください」 pattern to request actions politely. For example, 「ご協力願います」 (Please cooperate).\n*   **Expressing wishes:** Can also express a desire or hope, though less common in everyday conversation.\n*   **Formal settings:** Frequently found in business emails, announcements, and public service announcements.\n\nWhen using 「願う」, remember that it conveys a sense of humility and respect. It is a step up in politeness from 「ください」, making it ideal for situations where you want to show extra consideration.",
