        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used to express a polite request or wish, often in formal situations or when addressing superiors.",
        "function": "To make polite requests or express earnest wishes, especially in formal or public settings.",
        "nuance": "Conveys a strong sense of humility and respect on the part of the speaker, making the request sound less demanding than other polite forms. It implies seeking cooperation or understanding rather than commanding it.",
        "source": "resources/original/dojg/all/願う・願います.yaml"
    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「願う(ねがう)」 originates from the noun 「願い(ねがい)」, which means \"wish\" or \"request.\" The kanji 「願」 combines the elements 「頁」 (head) and 「原」 (source), suggesting the idea of expressing one's desires or thoughts from the core of one's being. Over time, it evolved into a verb to express the act of wishing or requesting something.",
    "writeup": "「願う・願います」 is a verb used to express a range of meanings from wishing and hoping to formally requesting or praying. It is predominantly used to make polite requests, particularly in formal, business, or public announcement contexts. The polite 「ます」 form, 「願います」, is commonly employed to add a higher degree of politeness and respect when addressing superiors, customers, or a general audience.\n\n**Key Usages:**\n*   **Polite Requests:** Often used in conjunction with the honorific prefixes 「お～」 (for Japanese verbs) and 「ご～」 (for Sino-Japanese nouns and verbs) to form very polite requests. For example, 「お書き願います」 (Please write) or 「ご報告願います」 (Please report).\n*   **Expressing Wishes/Hopes:** While less common in casual conversation, 「願う」 can express a deep desire or hope for a particular outcome, similar to \"to pray for\" or \"to wish for.\" This is often seen in the progressive form 「願っています」.\n*   **Formal and Impersonal Settings:** You will frequently encounter 「願います」 in written communications such as official notices, instructional documents, business emails, and public announcements (e.g., in train stations or airports). Its impersonal nature makes it suitable for addressing a collective audience without singling out individuals.\n\nWhen using 「願う」, it's crucial to understand that it conveys a sense of humility and consideration from the speaker. It is a more formal and indirect way of making a request compared to simply using the te-form followed by 「ください」, making it appropriate for situations where demonstrating deference and respect is paramount.",

                    "competing_grammar": "本日の会議にご参加ください。",
                    "mitigation": "While 「ご参加ください」 is polite, 「ご参加願います」 is more formal and humble, implying the speaker is considering the listener's convenience or comfort. This tone is more suitable for a formal business invitation where the speaker wishes to maintain a respectful distance while still making a clear request."

                    "mitigation": "「ご確認ください」 is a direct and polite request. However, 「ご確認願います」 carries a slightly higher degree of politeness and indirectness, which can be useful when a superior makes a request to a subordinate, softening the command while still conveying expectation. It's often preferred in formal written instructions or official settings."

                    "mitigation": "「ご遠慮ください」 is a common polite request. However, 「ご遠慮願います」 is the standard phrasing for public announcements in Japan, particularly on public transport. It is more impersonal and formal, suitable for addressing a large, undifferentiated audience with a general advisory rather than a direct command. The public setting of a train announcement highlights this distinction."

It conveys a profound, personal hope rather than a request for action. The context of a loving message from a grandmother emphasizes this sincere, benevolent wish."

For an older female speaker addressing her granddaughter, this phrasing conveys heartfelt affection and sincere good wishes, emphasizing a benevolent, non-demanding desire for the granddaughter's future happiness. The choice of 「いられるように」 further underscores the passive nature of the wish."

    "post_example_writeup": "When using 「願う・願います」, pay attention to the level of politeness required by the situation. The 「ます」 form is generally safe for most formal contexts, while combining it with other humble or honorific expressions can further elevate the level of respect.",

It's often preferred in formal, impersonal contexts like public announcements or official documents, where a direct command might be inappropriate or too harsh for a general audience. The use of 「ください」 is versatile and can be used in both formal and informal settings, but its directness contrasts with the inherent deference of 「願います」."

While both are used to make requests, 「願います」 carries a stronger sense of humility and respect, making it more suitable for formal situations where politeness and indirectness are valued.
