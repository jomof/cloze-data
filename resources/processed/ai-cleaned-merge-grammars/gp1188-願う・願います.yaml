        "function": "To make polite requests or express earnest wishes, especially in formal or public settings.",

        "source": "resources/original/dojg/all/願う・願います.yaml"
    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「願う(ねがう)」 originates from the noun 「願い(ねがい)」, which means \"wish\" or \"request.\" The kanji 「願」 combines the elements 「頁」 (head) and 「原」 (source), suggesting the idea of expressing one's desires or thoughts from the core of one's being. Over time, it evolved into a verb to express the act of wishing or requesting something.",
    "writeup": "「願う・願います」 is a verb used to express a range of meanings from wishing and hoping to formally requesting or praying. It is predominantly used to make polite requests, particularly in formal, business, or public announcement contexts. The polite 「ます」 form, 「願います」, is commonly employed to add a higher degree of politeness and respect when addressing superiors, customers, or a general audience.\n\n**Key Usages:**\n*   **Polite Requests:** Often used in conjunction with the honorific prefixes 「お～」 (for Japanese verbs) and 「ご～」 (for Sino-Japanese nouns and verbs) to form very polite requests. For example, 「お書き願います」 (Please write) or 「ご報告願います」 (Please report).\n*   **Expressing Wishes/Hopes:** While less common in casual conversation, 「願う」 can express a deep desire or hope for a particular outcome, similar to \"to pray for\" or \"to wish for.\" This is often seen in the progressive form 「願っています」.\n*   **Formal and Impersonal Settings:** You will frequently encounter 「願います」 in written communications such as official notices, instructional documents, business emails, and public announcements (e.g., in train stations or airports). Its impersonal nature makes it suitable for addressing a collective audience without singling out individuals.\n\nWhen using 「願う」, it's crucial to understand that it conveys a sense of humility and consideration from the speaker. It is a more formal and indirect way of making a request compared to simply using the te-form followed by 「ください」, making it appropriate for situations where demonstrating deference and respect is paramount.",
    "false_friends": [

            "term": "ください",
            "meaning": "please give me; please do",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ください」 is a more direct request than 「願います」 and can sometimes sound demanding if not used carefully. 「願います」 adds a layer of humility and consideration, making the request feel less like a command and more like a plea for cooperation or understanding. It's often preferred in formal, impersonal contexts like public announcements or official documents, where a direct command might be inappropriate or too harsh for a general audience. The use of 「ください」 is versatile and can be used in both formal and informal settings, but its directness contrasts with the inherent deference of 「願います」."

            "meaning": "to desire, to wish for, to hope for",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「望む」 implies a personal desire or expectation for a future outcome, often something one aims for or anticipates. In contrast, 「願う」 can carry a more humble, perhaps even reverent, tone, suggesting a plea or an earnest hope that may depend on external factors. While both express a wish, 「願う」 is often used for deeper, more heartfelt hopes, sometimes approaching the nuance of 'praying for' a positive outcome."

            "meaning": "to pray",

            "nuance": "「祈る」 specifically means to pray, often with religious or spiritual connotations, involving addressing a deity or higher power. 「願う」 can encompass this meaning, but it is broader and includes secular wishes and formal requests without the explicit religious implication. One might 「願う」 for something to happen, while 「祈る」 implies a more direct act of religious petition."

            "nuance": "「求める」 implies an active effort to seek or demand something, often from a position of need or perceived right. It can have a stronger, more assertive or sometimes even demanding nuance than 「願う」. 「願う」, especially in its polite forms, tends to be more humble and indirect, framing the request as a plea or a desire for cooperation rather than a direct claim or demand."

            "nuance": "「お願いする」 is a common and versatile way to make polite requests in general conversation and less formal business contexts. While both 「お願いする」 and 「願う」 (or 「願います」) are polite requests, 「願う」 often implies a more formal, institutional, or impersonal request, frequently found in official announcements, written documents, or when addressing a large, unspecified audience. 「お願いする」 is typically used for person-to-person requests, even if formal, whereas 「願う」 conveys a stronger sense of humility or a plea for cooperation in a directive manner."

            "nuance": "「依頼する」 typically refers to making a formal request for someone to perform a specific task or service, often implying a business or professional context where a task is assigned or commissioned. While 「願う」 can also involve requests, it often carries a more humble or earnest tone, especially in official instructions or public announcements, focusing on seeking cooperation or compliance for a desired outcome rather than commissioning a task. It highlights the speaker's deference and expectation of compliance."

            "nuance": "「希望する」 expresses a personal hope or desire for a future state or outcome, often an aspiration of the speaker. 「願う」, while also meaning to wish or hope, often carries a more profound, solemn, or even spiritual nuance, sometimes involving a plea or a prayer, especially when the outcome is largely beyond one's direct control or when making a formal, respectful request for cooperation or the fulfillment of a deeply held desire. Unlike 「希望する」, 「願う」 can also be used impersonally in formal directives."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "It's important to distinguish 「願う・願います」 from similar expressions like 「ください」. While both are used to make requests, 「願います」 carries a stronger sense of humility and respect, making it more suitable for formal situations where politeness and indirectness are valued.
