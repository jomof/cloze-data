        "usage-context": "Used to express a polite request or wish, often in formal situations or when addressing superiors.",
        "function": "To make polite requests or express earnest wishes, especially in formal or public settings.",
        "nuance": "Conveys a strong sense of humility and respect on the part of the speaker, making the request sound less demanding than other polite forms. It implies seeking cooperation or understanding rather than commanding it.",
        "source": "resources/original/dojg/all/願う・願います.yaml"
    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「願う(ねがう)」 originates from the noun 「願い(ねがい)」, which means \"wish\" or \"request.\" The kanji 「願」 combines the elements 「頁」 (head) and 「原」 (source), suggesting the idea of expressing one's desires or thoughts from the core of one's being. Over time, it evolved into a verb to express the act of wishing or requesting something.",
    "writeup": "「願う・願います」 is a verb used to express a range of meanings from wishing and hoping to formally requesting or praying. It is predominantly used to make polite requests, particularly in formal, business, or public announcement contexts. The polite 「ます」 form, 「願います」, is commonly employed to add a higher degree of politeness and respect when addressing superiors, customers, or a general audience.\n\n**Key Usages:**\n*   **Polite Requests:** Often used in conjunction with the honorific prefixes 「お～」 (for Japanese verbs) and 「ご～」 (for Sino-Japanese nouns and verbs) to form very polite requests. For example, 「お書き願います」 (Please write) or 「ご報告願います」 (Please report).\n*   **Expressing Wishes/Hopes:** While less common in casual conversation, 「願う」 can express a deep desire or hope for a particular outcome, similar to \"to pray for\" or \"to wish for.\" This is often seen in the progressive form 「願っています」.\n*   **Formal and Impersonal Settings:** You will frequently encounter 「願います」 in written communications such as official notices, instructional documents, business emails, and public announcements (e.g., in train stations or airports). Its impersonal nature makes it suitable for addressing a collective audience without singling out individuals.\n\nWhen using 「願う」, it's crucial to understand that it conveys a sense of humility and consideration from the speaker. It is a more formal and indirect way of making a request compared to simply using the te-form followed by 「ください」, making it appropriate for situations where demonstrating deference and respect is paramount.",

It's often preferred in formal, impersonal contexts like public announcements or official documents, where a direct command might be inappropriate or too harsh for a general audience. The use of 「ください」 is versatile and can be used in both formal and informal settings, but its directness contrasts with the inherent deference of 「願います」."
