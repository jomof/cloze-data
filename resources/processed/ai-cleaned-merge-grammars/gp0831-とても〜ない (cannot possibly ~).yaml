jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Can be used across various registers, though often conveys a strong, subjective feeling
    of impossibility
etymology: 「とても」 originally meant "exceedingly" or "very much." When used with a negative, it intensifies
  the negation, indicating something is absolutely not the case. Its usage with negative forms evolved
  to express an absolute inability or impossibility, reflecting a sense of being 'too much' for something
  to be achieved or endured.
writeup: 「とても〜ない」 is used to express a strong sense of impossibility or complete negation. It signifies
  that something is "not at all" possible or that one "cannot" do something at all. It emphasizes the
  speaker's feeling that something is entirely out of the question. This phrase is frequently used when
  conveying an emotional or subjective impossibility, rather than a purely objective one. While it often
  appears with the potential form of verbs (e.g., できない, 食べられない), it can also combine with adjectival nouns
  like 無理だ to convey a similar strong sense of impossibility.
false_friends:
  - term: ぜんぜん
    meaning: (Not) at all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「全然〜ない」 (zenzen ~ nai) also expresses complete negation, it can be used in a wider range
      of situations for things that are simply not the case or unexpected. 「とても〜ない」 specifically implies
      a strong sense of *impossibility* or absolute inability.
    grammar_point: 全然 (not at all; totally)
  - term: 全く〜ない
    meaning: Not~at all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「全く〜ない」 (mattaku ~ nai) is similar to 「全然〜ない」 in expressing complete negation. It can describe
      something that is entirely absent or untrue. However, 「とても〜ない」 retains its focus on a strong sense
      of impossibility or difficulty that makes something unachievable.
    grammar_point: 全く〜ない (not at all)
  - term: すこしも〜ない
    meaning: Not even a little, Not at all, Not in the least, Never
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「少しも〜ない」 (sukoshimo ~ nai) emphasizes the lack of even a tiny amount or degree of something.
      It is about quantity or extent. 「とても〜ない」, in contrast, focuses on the absolute impossibility of
      an action, state, or event occurring.
    grammar_point: すこしも〜ない (not even a little)
  - term: とうてい〜ない
    meaning: Absolutely impossible, by no means
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とうてい〜ない」 (tōtei ~ nai) is perhaps the closest in nuance to 「とても〜ない」, also expressing absolute
      impossibility. However, 「とうてい〜ない」 tends to be more formal and literary, emphasizing a logical or
      objective conclusion of impossibility, whereas 「とても〜ない」 can carry a more subjective or emotional
      nuance of 'it's just too much' to be possible.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:とうてい〜ない (absolutely impossible)
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 「全然」、「全く」, 「少しも」, and 「とうてい」 can all be used with negation,
  「とても〜ない」 specifically conveys a strong, often subjective, feeling that something is completely impossible,
  beyond one's capacity, or too difficult to achieve. It goes beyond simple negation, conveying an absolute
  lack of ability or possibility.
examples:
  - english: This amount of work, I can't possibly finish it.
    japanese:
      - こんな 量 の 仕事、{とても} 終わら {ない} よ。
      - こんな 量 の 仕事、{とても} 終わん {ない} よ。
      - こんな 量 の 仕事、{とても} 終わり ませ ん。
    english_literally: This amount of work, it absolutely won't end.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - こんな 量 の 仕事、{全然} 終わら ない よ。
        english: This amount of work, I won't finish it at all.
        hint: 「全然終わらない」 indicates a general negation or lack of progress, but 「とても終わらない」 emphasizes the
          *impossibility* due to the overwhelming nature of the task. We're looking for a strong sense
          of impossibility.
    scene: A male office worker complains to a colleague about an overwhelming workload.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The casual 「よ」 particle at the end, often used by male speakers in casual settings, adds a
      sense of exasperation and emphasizes his inability to complete the task. The contracted form 「終わんない」
      is characteristic of very casual speech.
  - english: I can't possibly believe what a liar like that says.
    japanese:
      - あんな 嘘つき の 言う こと は {とても} 信じ られ {ない} わ。
      - あんな 嘘つき の 言う こと は {とても} 信じ られ ませ ん。
      - あんな 嘘つき の 言う こと は {とても} 信じ られ {ない} な。

          - あんな 嘘つき の 言う こと は {全然} 信じ られ ない わ。
        english: I can't believe what a liar like that says at all.
        hint: 「全然信じられない」 implies a general disbelief. However, 「とても信じられない」 expresses a profound, emotional
          impossibility of trusting the person's words. We're looking for this strong, emotional disbelief.
    scene: A woman expressing her absolute distrust in someone's words due to their history of lying.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: potential (～られる/～える)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The feminine sentence-ending particle 「わ」 adds a soft but firm tone to the speaker's absolute
      disbelief, making the statement more emotional and personal. The use of 「な」 is also casual and can
      be used by both genders to express internal realization or mild assertion.
  - english: Going out in this rain is absolutely impossible.
    japanese:
      - この 雨 の 中 を 外出 する なんて、{とても} 無理 だ。

    english_literally: Going out in the middle of this rain, it is absolutely impossible.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 雨 の 中 を 外出 し {て は いけ ない}。
        english: You mustn't go out in this rain.
        hint: While 「とても無理だ」 conveys a strong subjective impossibility due to difficulty, 「てはいけない」 expresses
          a strong prohibition. We're looking for a grammar that expresses an absolute impossibility due
          to the situation, not a rule.

      - competing_japanese:
          - こんな 短い 時間 で は、全部 {覚え 切れ ない}。
        english: In such a short time, I can't completely memorize everything.
        hint: Without 「とても」, 「覚え切れない」 simply means 'cannot finish memorizing'. We're looking for the emphasis
          on the overwhelming impossibility given the time constraint.
    scene: A student panicking before a test, realizing they don't have enough time to study.
    register: formal
    setting: academic

      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな 高い バッグ は {買う わけ に は いか ない}。
        english: I cannot afford to buy such an expensive bag.
        hint: 「買うわけにはいかない」 implies an inability due to circumstances or rules. 「とても買えない」 emphasizes the
          *exorbitant price*, making it an 'absolute impossibility' for the speaker due to an overwhelming
          financial hurdle. We're looking for that strong personal sense of impossibility.
    scene: A young woman looking at a luxury bag in a shop window.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The 「よ」 particle here adds a sense of resignation or slight complaint, emphasizing her financial
      inability to afford the bag. While 「よ」 is often masculine, women can also use it to express assertion
      or a strong statement of fact.

        hint: 「どうにも〜ない」 emphasizes that no matter what one tries, something cannot be done. 「とても〜ない」 conveys

          for the sense of being completely stuck.
