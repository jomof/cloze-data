pronunciation:
  katakana: テミル
  romaji: temiru
formation:
  Verb[te-form] + 見る (みる): Expresses trying an action to see what happens, or performing an action experimentally.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express an action done experimentally, to test something, or to gain experience.
  function: To indicate trying, testing, or experiencing an action.
  nuance: Implies an element of curiosity, experimentation, or uncertainty about the outcome. It's not
    just "doing" but "doing to find out" or "doing as a test."
  colocation: Often follows verbs of action or experience.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a compound verb, with the main verb setting the action and '見る' adding
    the nuance of 'trying'.
etymology: The construction Verb[て] + 見る literally combines the 連用形 (ren'yōkei) of the main verb followed
  by the particle て (which here functions as a connective, indicating sequential or resultant action)
  and the verb 見る (みる), meaning "to see" or "to observe." Over time, this combination evolved from a literal
  "do and see the result" to a more abstract "try doing" or "do experimentally." This highlights that
  the act of "trying" inherently involves an element of observation or discovery regarding the outcome.
writeup: |-
  Verb[てみる] is a very common and useful grammar pattern in Japanese that expresses the idea of "trying to do something" or "doing something to see what happens." It is formed by taking the **te-form** of a verb and attaching みる. The みる part then conjugates like a regular る-verb.

  The core meaning comes from the literal sense of "do [X] and then see." For example, 寿司を食べてみる (sushi o tabete miru) literally means "eat sushi and see (what it's like)." This implies an element of experimentation, curiosity, or a test. It's not just "eating sushi," but "trying eating sushi" to experience it.

  This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts, from suggesting an action to expressing a personal attempt. It often carries a nuance of trying something for the first time, or trying something to evaluate its outcome.

  - term: 試す (tamesu)
    meaning: to test, to try out (a method, product)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 試す is more about testing a method or thing to see if it works or if it's effective. てみる is
      about trying an *action* for the first time, often with a nuance of personal experience or curiosity.
      For example, 「新しい薬を{試す}」 (to test a new medicine) vs. 「このケーキを{食べてみる}」 (to try eating this cake).
      試す can also imply evaluating something.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:試す (to test)
  - term: Verb[よう]とする
    meaning: to try to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Verb[よう]とする emphasizes the *effort* or *attempt* to do something, often implying that the
      action might not be completed or might be difficult. てみる implies completing the action to see the
      result. For example, 「ドアを開けようとした」 (I tried to open the door - implying it might have been stuck)
      vs. 「新しいドアを開けてみた」 (I tried opening the new door - implying I succeeded in opening it to see how
      it works).
    grammar_point: '[Verb-volitional]とする・としない (to try to・to not try to)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While Verb[てみる] implies engaging in an action to experience or evaluate it,
  試す focuses on testing the functionality or effectiveness of something. On the other hand, Verb[よう]とする
  highlights the effort made to initiate an action, even if the action is not fully completed or succeeds.
  The key distinction for てみる is the actual *performance* of the action followed by an observation of
  its outcome or experience.
