etymology: The word 「単に」 is formed from 「単 (tan)」 meaning 'simple' or 'single,' and 「に (ni)」, which functions
  as an adverbial marker. Thus, it literally means 'in a simple manner.' It conveys the idea of something
  being singular, uncomplicated, or merely what it appears to be, tracing its origin to the concept of
  'singleness' or 'plainness.'
writeup: |-
  「単に (tan ni)」 is an adverb used to express that something is "simply," "merely," "only," or "just" a particular state, condition, or action. It functions to limit or downplay the scope of what is being discussed, emphasizing that there are no additional complexities or hidden meanings.

  While 「単に」 shares a similar meaning with 「ただ」, 「単に」 often carries a slightly more formal or emphatic nuance. It is frequently employed when an explanation is given, clarifying that a situation is straightforward or that a particular outcome is due to a simple, singular cause rather than something more profound or complicated. It can also be used to indicate that something is "nothing more than" a certain thing, thereby reducing its significance.

  It is commonly followed by forms like 「～だけ」 (just/only) or 「～に過ぎない」 (nothing more than), which further reinforce the limiting or emphasizing nature of 「単に」.
false_friends:
  - term: ただ
    meaning: only; just; free of charge
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ただ」 can also mean 'just,' it is generally less formal than 「単に」 and can also mean 'free
      of charge,' a meaning which 「単に」 does not carry. 「ただ」 often has a softer, more conversational tone,
      lacking the precise, direct emphasis of 「単に」.
    grammar_point: ただ (the only thing is)
  - term: に過ぎない
    meaning: nothing more than; merely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に過ぎない」 is an expression that emphatically states something is 'nothing more than' a given
      entity, often implying insignificance or a lack of deeper meaning. While it conveys a similar sense
      of limitation, it is a grammatical pattern that acts as a definitive concluding judgment, whereas
      「単に」 is an adverb that introduces or sets up the simple nature.
    grammar_point: にすぎない (no more than)
  - term: ～にしか～ない
    meaning: only; merely; nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～にしか～ない」 is a grammatical structure that explicitly states a strong limitation, conveying
      that something is 'only' or 'nothing but' a certain way. It often emphasizes the implied insufficiency
      or strong restriction of the limited action or state, carrying a slightly negative connotation.
      While 「単に」 can precede this structure for added emphasis, 「～にしか～ない」 inherently conveys this strong,
      limiting sense on its own.
    grammar_point: しか〜ない (only, nothing but)
  - term: のみ
    meaning: only; just; merely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「のみ」 is a more formal and literary equivalent of 「だけ」 or 「しか～ない」, conveying an exclusive 'only'
      or 'nothing but'. While 「単に」 sets up the simple nature of something, 「のみ」 acts as a strong, formal
      limiter for what follows, often found in written or highly formal contexts.
    grammar_point: のみ (only・just)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  While 「単に」, 「ただ」, 「に過ぎない」, 「～にしか～ない」, and 「のみ」 all convey a sense of limitation or exclusiveness, their applications and nuances vary. 「単に」 serves as a precise, often formal, adverb that emphasizes the singular, straightforward nature of something, stripping away any perceived complexities. It suggests that there is 'nothing more to it' than what is being stated.
  In contrast, 「ただ」 is a more colloquial and flexible term. While it shares the meaning of 'just' or 'only' with 「単に」, it lacks the formal directness and can also carry meanings like 'free of charge.' Its use often results in a softer, less assertive statement.
  「に過ぎない」 is a definitive concluding expression, functioning to emphatically state that something is 'nothing more than' a given entity, often implying insignificance or a lack of deeper meaning. It acts as a final judgment on the limited nature of something.
  Similarly, 「～にしか～ない」 also expresses strong limitation, typically implying insufficiency or a strong restriction. It highlights that 'only' a certain amount or state exists, and that amount is often seen as inadequate. Although 「単に」 can precede it for emphasis, 「～にしか～ない」 inherently conveys this strong, often negative, limiting sense on its own.
  Lastly, 「のみ」 is a highly formal and literary term equivalent to 「だけ」, denoting exclusivity or 'only.' It is frequently encountered in written Japanese or very formal speech. While 「単に」 might introduce the simple nature, 「のみ」 functions as a strong, formal marker to restrict the scope of what is being discussed to a single item or condition. Understanding these distinctions allows for greater precision in expressing degrees of limitation and emphasis.

      potential, but less significant, factors.
  - english: He's simply trying to avoid responsibility.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は {ただ} 責任 を 避け よう と し て いる だけ です。
        english: He's just trying to avoid responsibility.
        hint: When making a pointed accusation about someone's simple motive, '単に' carries a stronger,
          more accusatory tone, implying a lack of other, more complex reasons. We're looking for a more
          direct statement of his singular motive.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 責任 を 避け よう と し て いる {だけ} です。
        english: He's only trying to avoid responsibility.
        hint: This implies 'only' but without the explicit adverbial emphasis of 'simply.' We're looking
          for a word that highlights the straightforward, perhaps cynical, nature of his actions.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing another's behavior, and one concludes that his actions are driven
      by a very basic, selfish motivation.
    register: casual
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「単に」 here expresses a direct and somewhat critical judgment, implying that the
      person's behavior stems from a straightforward, perhaps transparent, desire to avoid accountability,
      with no hidden complexities or noble intentions.
post_example_writeup: 「単に」 is particularly effective when you want to make a clear, unadorned statement
  about a situation, stripping away any perceived complexities or deeper implications. Its emphasis is
  on simplicity and limitation, often used to correct a misconception or present a straightforward explanation.
