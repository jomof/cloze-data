    "etymology": "The word 「ところ」 itself means \"place\" or \"situation.\" In this grammar point, it refers to the 'place' in time immediately after an action, emphasizing the result or consequence that follows.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ところ」 indicates that something occurred *as a result* of a preceding action. It is similar to \"when\" or \"then,\" but with a stronger implication of direct consequence. It is predominantly used in formal writing and speech, lending a sense of sophistication and objectivity. The verb before 「ところ」 is always in the past informal (た) form.  It can describe a sequence of events where the first leads to the second. The nuance suggests a cause-and-effect relationship, not just a simple chronological order.",
