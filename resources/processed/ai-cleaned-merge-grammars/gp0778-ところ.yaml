        "function": "Indicates that a certain situation or result came about following a specific action or event.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes the subsequent state or discovery directly linked to the prior action, often with a sense of discovery or surprise.",
        "source": "DOJG",

    "etymology": "The word 「ところ」 literally means 'place,' 'spot,' 'scene,' 'situation,' or 'circumstance.' Its usage here extends this meaning to refer to the 'situation' or 'state' that arises *after* an action has been completed, often revealing an unexpected or newly discovered outcome.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ところ」, when preceded by a verb in its past tense (た-form), indicates that a certain situation or result arose upon the completion of the preceding action. It is often used to convey that the outcome was somewhat unexpected or newly discovered as a consequence of the action. This usage of 「ところ」 emphasizes the subsequent state or discovery directly linked to the prior action. It is typically found in formal or written contexts, lending a somewhat objective or reporting tone to the statement. While 「～たら」 and 「～た時」 can also express a temporal sequence, 「ところ」 distinctly highlights the *result* or *consequence* that follows the action, often with a sense of discovery or surprise.",
