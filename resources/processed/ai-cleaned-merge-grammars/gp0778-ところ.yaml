    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ところ」 functions as a noun that connects to a verb in the past, informal form to describe a situation that unfolds **after** a certain action or event. It's commonly used in written or formal speech to express an unexpected or surprising result. Essentially, 「～ところ」 highlights what happened *as a consequence* of the preceding action.  It carries a nuance of discovery or unexpectedness regarding the outcome. It can also be used after a noun + の to indicate a place, situation, or circumstance, which is less common.  When used in this grammatical structure, it is quite formal.",
