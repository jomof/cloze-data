        "part-of-speech": "noun",
        "register": "formal",
        "function": "Indicates that a certain situation or result came about following a specific action or event.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes the subsequent state or discovery directly linked to the prior action, often with a sense of discovery or surprise.",
        "source": "DOJG",

    "etymology": "The word 「ところ」 literally means 'place,' 'spot,' 'scene,' 'situation,' or 'circumstance.' Its usage here extends this meaning to refer to the 'situation' or 'state' that arises *after* an action has been completed, often revealing an unexpected or newly discovered outcome.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ところ」, when preceded by a verb in its past tense (た-form), indicates that a certain situation or result arose upon the completion of the preceding action. It is often used to convey that the outcome was somewhat unexpected or newly discovered as a consequence of the action. This usage of 「ところ」 emphasizes the subsequent state or discovery directly linked to the prior action. It is typically found in formal or written contexts, lending a somewhat objective or reporting tone to the statement. While 「～たら」 and 「～た時」 can also express a temporal sequence, 「ところ」 distinctly highlights the *result* or *consequence* that follows the action, often with a sense of discovery or surprise.",

            "meaning": "if; when",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「ところ」, 「たら」 does not necessarily emphasize an unexpected or surprising result; it simply states a condition or temporal sequence without a strong focus on the outcome as a discovery."

        {
            "term": "時（に）",
            "meaning": "when; at the time of",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「ところ」, 「時（に）」 is a more general expression for 'when' and does not focus on the outcome or discovery that follows an action; it simply indicates a point in time."

            "term": "結果（けっか）",
            "meaning": "as a result of",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「ところ」 implies a result, 「結果」 more explicitly states the cause-and-effect relationship, often in a more formal or analytical context. 「ところ」 carries a nuance of discovery rather than just stating a direct consequence."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「たら」 and 「時（に）」 can also translate to 'when,' 「ところ」 specifically emphasizes the *result* or subsequent situation that arises, often with a sense of discovery or unexpectedness. 「結果」 similarly indicates a result, but 「ところ」 is more about the realization *upon* an action, making it less direct than 「結果」's explicit cause-and-effect. Choose 「ところ」 when you want to highlight the connection between an action and its outcome, particularly if the result is a newfound situation or something surprising.",
