        "usage-context": "Used to explicitly state the grounds or justification for an action, event, or situation.",
        "function": "To present a clear and emphasized reason or cause.",
        "nuance": "Highlights the preceding statement as the definitive reason, often implying a formal or official explanation, or a strong personal conviction.",
        "grammatical-role": "Adverbial modifier, modifying the subsequent clause by specifying the reason.",

    },
    "etymology": "「という」 is a quotative particle indicating the content of the reason. 「理由」 (riyū) means \"reason,\" and 「で」 indicates \"by means of\" or \"with.\" The phrase therefore literally means \"by means of the reason that...\"",
    "writeup": "「という理由で」 is a phrase used to clearly state the reason or grounds for an action, event, or situation. It places strong emphasis on the preceding statement as the definitive cause, making it akin to English phrases like \"for the reason that,\" \"on the grounds that,\" or \"due to the fact that.\"\n\nThis expression is versatile and can be applied in various contexts, from explaining objective facts to justifying personal decisions. The particle 「で」 following 「理由」 (reason) specifies that the reason is the means or cause by which something occurs. For instance, if you say 「疲れたという理由で早く帰った」 (I went home early for the reason that I was tired), it emphasizes that tiredness was the specific and explicit cause of your early departure.\n\n**Distinction with 「というわけで」**\nIt is important to note the difference between 「という理由で」 and 「というわけで」. While both can express causality, 「という理由で」 focuses on a *specific, explicit reason* for a consequence. In contrast, 「というわけで」 (meaning \"and so,\" \"that's why,\" or \"as a result\") often refers to a more general conclusion or a summary of circumstances leading to an outcome. 「わけ」 (訳) can sometimes be read as 「りゆう」 (理由) historically, but in modern Japanese, 「理由」 specifically refers to a clear, stated reason. Therefore, while 「という理由で」 can often be replaced by 「というわけで」 in many contexts, the reverse is not always true, especially when a precise justification is intended.",
