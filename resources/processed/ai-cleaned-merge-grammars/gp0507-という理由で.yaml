    "etymology": "「という」is a quotative particle indicating the content of the reason, 「理由」means 'reason,' and 「で」indicates 'by means of' or 'because of.' Thus, the phrase literally means 'by means of the reason that...'",
    "writeup": "「という理由で」is a phrase used to provide the reason or justification for something. It emphasizes the reason being presented, similar to \"being that\" in English. It's often used when explaining why something happened or expressing one's opinion. Because 「という」is quoting the statement as being the 'reason', 「という理由で」 puts quite a bit of emphasis on the reason itself. You could almost say it's the equivalent of, \"...on the grounds that...\" or \"...with the reasoning that...\".\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「で」 functions as a case-marking particle after 「理由」, indicating 'with' or 'by means of' that reason.\n*   Almost all instances where 「という理由で」 can be used, 「というわけで」 is also appropriate. However, the reverse isn't always true. 「わけ」can sometimes replace 「理由」, but 「理由」can't always replace 「わけ」, especially at the beginning of sentences. This is because 「わけ」is another way of reading the kanji for 「理由」. However, the more common kanji for 「訳」 will never be read as 「りゆう」.",
