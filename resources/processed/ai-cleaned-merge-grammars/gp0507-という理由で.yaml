    "etymology": "「という」 is a quotative particle indicating the content of the reason. 「理由」 (riyū) means \"reason,\" and 「で」 indicates \"by means of\" or \"with.\" The phrase therefore literally means \"by means of the reason that...\"",
    "writeup": "「という理由で」 is used to provide a reason or justification for something. It emphasizes the stated reason, similar to \"being that\" or \"on the grounds that\" in English. It is a versatile phrase applicable to various situations, from explaining events to expressing opinions. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「という理由で」 can often be replaced with 「というわけで」, but the reverse is not always true. 「わけ」 can sometimes be used in place of 「理由」, but 「理由」 cannot always replace 「わけ」.",
