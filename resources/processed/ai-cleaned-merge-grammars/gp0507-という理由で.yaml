        "function": "To present a clear and emphasized reason or cause.",
        "nuance": "Highlights the preceding statement as the definitive reason, often implying a formal or official explanation, or a strong personal conviction.",

    "etymology": "「という」 is a quotative particle indicating the content of the reason. 「理由」 (riyū) means \"reason,\" and 「で」 indicates \"by means of\" or \"with.\" The phrase therefore literally means \"by means of the reason that...\"",
    "writeup": "「という理由で」 is a phrase used to clearly state the reason or grounds for an action, event, or situation. It places strong emphasis on the preceding statement as the definitive cause, making it akin to English phrases like \"for the reason that,\" \"on the grounds that,\" or \"due to the fact that.\"\n\nThis expression is versatile and can be applied in various contexts, from explaining objective facts to justifying personal decisions. The particle 「で」 following 「理由」 (reason) specifies that the reason is the means or cause by which something occurs. For instance, if you say 「疲れたという理由で早く帰った」 (I went home early for the reason that I was tired), it emphasizes that tiredness was the specific and explicit cause of your early departure.\n\n**Distinction with 「というわけで」**\nIt is important to note the difference between 「という理由で」 and 「というわけで」. While both can express causality, 「という理由で」 focuses on a *specific, explicit reason* for a consequence. In contrast, 「というわけで」 (meaning \"and so,\" \"that's why,\" or \"as a result\") often refers to a more general conclusion or a summary of circumstances leading to an outcome. 「わけ」 (訳) can sometimes be read as 「りゆう」 (理由) historically, but in modern Japanese, 「理由」 specifically refers to a clear, stated reason. Therefore, while 「という理由で」 can often be replaced by 「というわけで」 in many contexts, the reverse is not always true, especially when a precise justification is intended.",

            "nuance": "「から」 simply states a cause-and-effect relationship, often in a more casual context, without the strong emphasis or formality of explicitly citing a 'reason' as 「という理由で」 does. 「から」 is a conjunction, connecting clauses, while 「という理由で」 is a phrase that functions adverbially."

However, it still lacks the explicit emphasis on the 'reason' itself that 「という理由で」 provides. 「ので」 is a conjunction, connecting clauses, while 「という理由で」 is a phrase that functions adverbially."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between 「という理由で」 and other causal expressions like 「そのため(に)」, 「から」, or 「ので」, consider the degree of emphasis you wish to place on the reason. 「という理由で」 specifically highlights the preceding statement as the definitive and explicit grounds for what follows, often used when providing formal justifications or strong personal convictions. In contrast, 「そのため(に)」 is more about linking cause and effect directly, while 「から」 and 「ので」 are more general causal conjunctions without the added nuance of explicitly stating 'the reason'.",
