  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  function: Expresses naturalness or expectedness
  nuance: Strong expectation, sometimes implies "serves them right" or slight disapproval if negative.
  grammatical-role: predicate modifier
etymology: The term 当然 (tōzen) combines 当 (tō, meaning 'to hit,' 'to be applicable,' 'to be proper') and
  然 (zen, a suffix indicating 'state' or 'manner,' often seen in words like 自然 shizen 'nature' or 偶然 gūzen
  'by chance'). Thus, 当然 literally means "to be in a proper/fitting state or manner." When combined with
  the て-form of a verb or adjective, it asserts that the action or state is exactly what 'fits' or 'should
  be' in a given situation, making it natural or expected. The て-form itself signifies a preceding action
  or state that leads to the following conclusion, reinforcing the idea that the natural outcome *results
  from* the preceding action/state.
writeup: The grammar pattern 「〜て当然だ」 is used to express that a certain action, state, or outcome is **natural,
  obvious, or to be expected**. It conveys a strong sense that, given the circumstances, the conclusion
  is logical and unavoidable. It can be translated as "it's natural that...", "it's obvious that...",
  "of course...", or "it stands to reason that...". This expression implies that the speaker believes
  the situation is entirely reasonable and in line with common sense or prior information. It can be applied
  to both positive and negative outcomes. When used with a **negative outcome**, 「〜て当然だ」 can sometimes
  carry a nuance of **"serves them right"** or "it's no surprise that this bad thing happened because
  of X." This is important to note as it can sound critical or judgmental in certain contexts. **Formation:**
  * **Verb (て-form) + 当然だ** (e.g., 疲れて当然だ - it's natural to be tired) * **い-Adjective (くて-form) + 当然だ**
  (e.g., 忙しくて当然だ - it's natural to be busy) * **な-Adjective (で) + 当然だ** (e.g., 元気で当然だ - it's natural to
  be healthy) * **Noun (で) + 当然だ** (e.g., 学生で当然だ - it's natural to be a student) It can also be used in
  the form **「〜のは当然だ」** to nominalize the preceding clause, emphasizing the naturalness of the entire
  action or fact. For example, 「彼が怒るのは当然だ」 (It's natural for him to get angry). While 「〜て当然だ」 expresses
  strong certainty, it generally refers to what is **naturally inherent or logically follows** from a
  situation. It's often used in explanations or to justify an outcome.

  - term: に決まっている (surely is)
    meaning: It is surely the case; It is bound to be; It is certainly true.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: に決まっている expresses a strong conviction or certainty that something *must* be the case, often
      based on strong evidence or deduction, even if it's not universally "natural." 「〜て当然だ」 focuses on
      the inherent naturalness or logical expectation of an outcome.
    grammar_point: に決まっている (surely is)
  - term: はずだ (expected to be)
    meaning: Bound to be, Expected to be, Should be (able)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: はずだ expresses an expectation based on information, plans, or general understanding, implying
      a high probability. While often natural, it can also be used for expectations that might not be
      universally "obvious" or "inherent." 「〜て当然だ」 emphasizes the inherent naturalness or logical inevitability.
    grammar_point: はずだ (expected to be)
  - term: ものだ (general truth expectation)
    meaning: Indicates something is natural, expected, or supposed to be a certain way.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ものだ states a general truth, common practice, or inherent characteristic. It describes what
      is generally *expected* or *supposed to be*, but it doesn't carry the same strong sense of a specific
      outcome being *obvious* or *unavoidable* given a particular situation, as 「〜て当然だ」 does. 「ものだ」 is
      more about universal tendencies; 「〜て当然だ」 is about specific, logical conclusions.
    grammar_point: ものだ (general truth expectation)
  - term: 〜に足る (worthy of)
    meaning: To be worthy of, To be enough, To be sufficient
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜に足る indicates that something is worthy of a certain action or consideration. While "worth"
      can sometimes align with "natural," it's about deservingness, not inherent obviousness or logical
      consequence. It is often used in formal or literary contexts.
    grammar_point: に足る (worthy of)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「〜て当然だ」, 「に決まっている」, 「はずだ」, and 「ものだ」, consider the subtle
  differences in certainty and basis of expectation. 「〜て当然だ」 asserts that something is inherently logical
  or a natural consequence, leaving little room for doubt. 「に決まっている」 is about strong deduction and certainty,
  often from evidence. 「はずだ」 is about expectation based on information or plans. 「ものだ」 describes general
  truths or common characteristics. Use 「〜に足る」 when discussing deservingness or merit, not naturalness.

post_example_writeup: Understanding the core meaning of 「当然だ」 as something that is logically or inherently
  expected will help you distinguish it from similar expressions. While 「はずだ」 and 「に決まっている」 express high
  probability or certainty, 「当然だ」 specifically emphasizes the naturalness or inevitability of the outcome
  given the situation. It's often used when an action or state is a direct and logical consequence of
  a preceding condition or widely accepted truth.
