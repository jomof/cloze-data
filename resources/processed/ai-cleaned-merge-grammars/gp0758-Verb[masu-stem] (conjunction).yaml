    "etymology": "The ます-stem of a verb is formed by removing the ます ending from the polite ます form. This stem is then used to connect clauses, functioning similarly to the English word \"and.\" It implies a sequence or simultaneity of actions. The ます form itself comes from the auxiliary verb ます, which indicates politeness. This usage of the ます-stem leverages the polite form's inherent ability to link smoothly within sentences. Analogously, な-adjective and noun stems can also connect clauses in a similar formal or literary fashion, omitting connecting particles like な or で, creating a concise flow.",
    "writeup": "The ます-stem conjunction is a versatile grammatical tool that connects verbs, indicating sequential or simultaneous actions. It's formed by taking the ます-stem of a verb (removing ます) and using it to link clauses. This construction avoids abrupt breaks in the sentence, creating a smoother flow. This conjunctive use is often found in more formal, written, or literary contexts, providing a concise way to link ideas without explicit conjunctions. While primarily for verbs, a similar conjunctive pattern is also observed with な-adjectives and nouns, where their stems connect directly to the following clause to describe qualities or states, also imparting a formal or descriptive tone. The overall register of the sentence will be determined by the forms of the surrounding verbs and other grammatical elements.",

The て-form, while versatile, often carries stronger implications of cause, effect, or strict sequence and is more common in spoken language. そして is a separate conjunction explicitly meaning 'and then,' providing a clear break between clauses. Particles like が and ので serve specific functions: が for contrast or general connection, and ので for explicit causation.
