    "formation": {
        "Verb (masu-stem)": "Used as a conjunction to link consecutive or simultaneous actions."
    },
    "jlpt": "N3",
    "meaning": "Treats the verb's ます-stem as a conjunction, linking consecutive or simultaneous actions (like \"and\" or \"then\").",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "verb",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "function": "To connect two or more actions performed in sequence or simultaneously.",
        "nuance": "Imparts a sense of continuation or progression.",
        "colocation": "Often used with verbs describing daily routines, formal procedures, or narrative sequences.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a conjunctive form, maintaining sentence flow.",
        "logical-flow": "Presents actions in a smooth, continuous, or parallel manner.",
        "temporal-flow": "Indicates sequential or simultaneous actions, often without strict temporal boundaries unless implied by context."
    },
    "etymology": "The ます-stem of a verb is derived by removing the ます ending from the polite ます form. This stem is then used to connect clauses, functioning similarly to the English word \"and.\" It implies a sequence or simultaneity of actions. The ます form itself comes from the auxiliary verb ます, which indicates politeness. This usage of the ます-stem leverages the polite form's inherent ability to link smoothly within sentences.",
    "writeup": "The ます-stem conjunction is a versatile grammatical tool that connects verbs, indicating sequential or simultaneous actions. It's formed by taking the ます-stem of a verb (removing ます) and using it to link clauses. This construction avoids abrupt breaks in the sentence, creating a smoother flow. The register of the sentence will be determined by the forms of the surrounding verbs and other grammatical elements.",

The ます-stem conjunction provides a smooth, often formal or literary transition between actions, emphasizing sequence, simultaneity, or a simple listing without strong causal or temporal implications. The て-form, while versatile, often carries stronger implications of cause, effect, or strict sequence and is more common in spoken language. そして is a separate conjunction explicitly meaning 'and then,' providing a clear break between clauses. Particles like が and ので serve specific functions: が for contrast or general connection, and ので for explicit causation.
