    "etymology": "「どの」 belongs to the same family of interrogative words as 「どれ」 (which one) and 「どこ」 (where). It specifies a choice from multiple options.",
    "writeup": "「どの」 is categorized as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞 *rentaishi*) in Japanese. These are special words that modify nouns but do not conjugate, meaning their form remains consistent regardless of context.\n\nLike 「どれ」 and 「どこ」, 「どの」 is an interrogative word. It is specifically used to ask \"which\" thing someone will choose, but notably, it always precedes a noun (e.g., 「どの本」, which book). It can be employed in direct questions or to express the idea of \"whatever\" or \"whichever\" in English.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「どの」 is typically used when there are **three or more** possible choices. If there are only two choices, the words 「どっち (の)」 or 「どちら (の)」 are used instead.",
