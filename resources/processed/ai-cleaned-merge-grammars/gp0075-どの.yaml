    "etymology": "「どの」 belongs to the same family of interrogative words as 「どれ」 (which one) and 「どこ」 (where). It specifies a choice from multiple options.",
    "writeup": "「どの」 is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞 *rentaishi*) in Japanese. These words do not conjugate and always appear in the same form.\n\n「どの」 is from the same family of words as 「どれ」 and 「どこ」 and is used for asking about \"which\" thing someone will choose. 「どの」 modifies a noun directly, specifying which one out of a group is being referred to. It can be used in questions or to indicate \"whatever\" or \"whichever\" in English.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「どの」 is generally used when there are **three or more** possible choices. For two choices, use 「どっち (の)」 or 「どちら (の)」 instead.",
