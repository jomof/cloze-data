    "etymology": "どの belongs to the same family of interrogative words as どれ (which one) and どこ (where). As a 連体詞 (rentaishi), or pre-nominal adjectival, it historically developed to specifically precede and modify nouns, distinguishing it from related interrogatives that function as standalone pronouns or adverbs.",
    "writeup": "どの is categorized as a 連体詞 (rentaishi), or pre-noun adjectival, in Japanese. These are special words that modify nouns but do not conjugate, meaning their form remains consistent regardless of context. Unlike true adjectives (形容詞), 連体詞 cannot end a sentence or take common conjugational endings.Like どれ and どこ, どの is an interrogative word. It is specifically used to ask \"which\" thing someone will choose, but notably, it always precedes a noun (e.g., どの 本, which book). It can be employed in direct questions or, in certain contexts, to express the idea of \"whatever\" or \"whichever\" in English, emphasizing a lack of specific preference among multiple options.When there are only two choices, the words どっち (の) or どちら (の) are generally used instead. For instance, when presented with red and blue options, どっち will be used. However, if the choice is among red, blue, green, and yellow, どの would be the appropriate choice.",
