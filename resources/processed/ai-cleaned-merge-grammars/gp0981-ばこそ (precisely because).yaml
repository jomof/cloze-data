details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Primarily used in formal or literary contexts, conveying a stiff or emphatic tone.
  function: Emphasizes the preceding clause as the definitive and sometimes surprising reason for the
    subsequent outcome.
  nuance: Strongly asserts that the stated reason is the exclusive or most significant cause. Often implies
    a profound or unavoidable connection between the cause and effect.
  grammatical-role: Connects two clauses, with the first clause providing the emphatic reason for the
    second.
  logical-flow: Establishes a cause-and-effect relationship where the cause is presented as the singular
    and decisive factor.
etymology: The grammar point 「ばこそ」 is a combination of the conditional particle 「ば」 and the emphasizing
  particle 「こそ」. 「ば」 indicates a conditional relationship (if, when), while 「こそ」 emphasizes the preceding
  word or phrase as the primary reason or condition. Historically, 「こそ」 intensified the preceding element,
  drawing attention to it as the definitive factor. When combined with the conditional 「ば」, it highlights
  that the condition specified by 「ば」 is the sole or most important reason for the outcome, thus leading
  to the meaning of 'precisely because'.
writeup: '「ばこそ」 is similar to 「からこそ」, indicating that A is the precise reason for B. It translates to
  "precisely because of A" or "it is only due to A that B". This pattern combines the conjunction particle
  「ば」 and the adverbial particle 「こそ」, which is used similarly to a sentence-ending particle for emphasis.
  「ばこそ」 can follow almost any word type adjusted into its hypothetical form. For nouns and な-adjectives,
  it appears as 「であればこそ」. For い-adjectives and verbs, the conditional ば-form is used, followed by 「こそ」.In
  many cases, A is a reason not easily conceived as leading to B under normal circumstances, requiring
  emphasis with 「こそ」. This construction highlights that the stated reason is the definitive, often surprising,
  cause for the outcome. 「ばこそ」 is very formal and somewhat old-fashioned, making 「からこそ」 the preferred
  choice in modern Japanese conversation, but 「ばこそ」 maintains a strong, almost exclusive nuance, emphasizing
  that the reason is the *only* reason for the outcome.Important Consideration: 「ばこそ」 emphasizes the reason
  more strongly and is often used in formal speech or writing, giving it a more profound or assertive
  tone. It is typically found in contexts where the speaker wants to convey a deep sense of conviction
  or a universally applicable truth, or to justify an action that might otherwise seem unusual. Due to
  its formal and somewhat literary nature, it is less common in casual, everyday conversation.'

  - term: てこそ
    meaning: Only if, precisely by, not until
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ばこそ」, 「てこそ」 emphasizes that a certain condition must be met or action must be completed
      before a particular result can occur. It implies a prerequisite, suggesting that the result is only
      possible *after* the condition is fulfilled.
    grammar_point: Verb[て]+こそ (only if or by)
  - term: からこそ (emphasized reason)
    meaning: Emphasized because, Precisely because
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While similar in meaning to 「ばこそ」, 「からこそ」 is less formal and more commonly used in everyday
      conversation. It emphasizes the reason but without the strong, almost exclusive, nuance of 「ばこそ」,
      which implies that the reason given is the definitive and sometimes surprising cause.
    grammar_point: からこそ (emphasized reason)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「ばこそ」 is a more formal and emphatic version of 「からこそ」. While both express
  "precisely because," 「ばこそ」 is often found in formal writing or speeches and carries a stronger, almost
  exclusive nuance regarding the reason. It emphasizes that the stated reason is the definitive and sometimes
  unexpected cause for the outcome. For example, if you want to say, "Precisely because you are my friend,
  I can tell you this," 「ばこそ」 would be used to imply that *only* because of your friendship could this
  be said.「てこそ」 has a slightly different nuance, emphasizing the necessity of a condition being met before
  a result can occur, whereas 「ばこそ」 focuses solely on the reason itself. For instance, 「努力してこそ、成功がある」
  (Only by making an effort will there be success) implies that effort is a prerequisite for success.
  In contrast, 「努力すればこそ、成功した」 (Precisely because I made an effort, I succeeded) highlights the effort
  as the reason for success.

    japanese:
