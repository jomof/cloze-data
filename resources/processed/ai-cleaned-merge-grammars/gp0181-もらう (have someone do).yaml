    "meaning": "To receive a benefit from someone's action; to have someone do something for you.",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Varies depending on the politeness level of the verb used with もらう.",
        "Function": "Expressing receipt of a favor or service.",
        "Nuance": "Indicates that the speaker or someone in their 'in-group' is the recipient of an action or favor. The giver is typically of equal or lower status than the recipient.",
        "Counterpart": "くれる (kureru) which indicates the giver is doing the favor."

        "Verb (て-form) + もらえませんか": "Polite request for someone to do something."
    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「もらう (morau)」 originally meant 'to receive'. When used as an auxiliary verb in the pattern Vて + もらう, it retains the sense of receiving, but specifically indicates that the speaker or someone closely associated with them is receiving a benefit from the action described by the verb.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「もらう (morau)」 is used to express that the speaker or someone closely related to the speaker received a benefit from someone's action. It is always used as an auxiliary verb attached to the te-form of another verb. The basic structure is **Verb (て-form) + もらう**. \n\nImportant considerations:\n*   The giver is typically of equal or lower status than the recipient. If someone is of higher status, using いただく would be more appropriate.\n*   The subject of the sentence is the person who receives the benefit.",

            "setting": "academic",
            "nuance": "「もらいました」is the polite past tense form of 「もらう」. As the speaker had 「先生」teach them kanji, 「もらいました」 shows respect for the teacher by acknowledging the benefit received in a polite manner."

            "listener_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "This sentence expresses a deep desire for the listener to stay by the speaker's side. The 「もらいたい」 construction emphasizes the speaker's strong wish, while 「君にだけは」underscores that this desire is exclusive to the listener. A male speaker might use this intimate tone to convey his feelings to the woman he desires.",
            "etymology": "The use of 「君」shows endearment. Also, 「もらいたい」implies a request in a close relationship."
