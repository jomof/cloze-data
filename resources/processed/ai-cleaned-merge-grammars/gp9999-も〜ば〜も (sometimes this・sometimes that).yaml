id: gp9999
meaning: both X and Y; sometimes X, sometimes Y; X also, and Y also
pronunciation:
  katakana: モ〜バ〜モ
  romaji: mo~ba~mo
formation:
  Noun も Verb[ば形] Noun も: Used when listing two nouns and their associated actions or states.
  Noun も い-Adjective[ければ] Noun も: Used when listing two nouns and their associated い-adjective states.
  Noun も な-Adjective[であれば] Noun も: Used when listing two nouns and their associated な-adjective states.

jlpt: N2
etymology: The particle 「も」(mo) itself indicates inclusion or "also/too." The 「ば」(ba) form is a conditional
  or hypothetical form of verbs and adjectives, indicating "if" or "when." When combined in the pattern
  「A も B ば C も」, it literally means something like "if A also, then C also," or "A also, and C also."
  This structure evolved to express that multiple conditions or items are equally applicable or present,
  highlighting their coexistence rather than a strict conditional relationship.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern 「〜も〜ば〜も」 is used to indicate that multiple items, actions, or states are applicable, true, or occur. It can connect various parts of speech, including nouns, verbs, adjectives, and even entire clauses. The core function is to present a comprehensive list or a pair of elements, emphasizing that both are included or present.

  This pattern often translates to "both X and Y," "sometimes X, sometimes Y," or "X as well as Y." It highlights that the characteristic or action applies to all mentioned elements, suggesting a breadth or variety. For instance, if you say 「彼は料理もすれば、洗濯もする」(Kare wa ryōri mo sureba, sentaku mo suru), it means "He both cooks and does laundry," emphasizing his diverse household skills.

  While it literally uses the 「ば」 conditional form, in this construction, it does not always imply a direct conditional relationship. Instead, it serves to link the elements in a parallel or enumerative fashion. The first 「も」 emphasizes the inclusivity of the first item, and the second 「も」 extends that inclusivity to the second (and subsequent) items.

  This construction is quite versatile and can be used in a wide range of situations, from describing someone's personality to listing features of a place or conditions of a situation. It is a natural way to express "not only A, but also B" when listing parallel characteristics or actions.

  - term: そして (and・and then)
    meaning: and; and then
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そして」 is a simple conjunctive adverb that connects sentences or clauses in sequence or adds
      more information. It does not carry the emphasis of inclusivity or the "both... and..." nuance that
      「〜も〜ば〜も」 does. 「〜も〜ば〜も」 specifically highlights that multiple things each possess a quality or each
      happen.
    grammar_point: そして (and・and then)
  - term: 〜し〜し (and; listing reasons)
    meaning: and; listing reasons
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜し〜し」 lists multiple reasons or facts. While it also lists multiple items, its primary nuance
      is to provide reasons or supportive facts, often leading to a conclusion. 「〜も〜ば〜も」 emphasizes the
      coexistence or mutual applicability of the listed items, not necessarily their role as reasons.
    grammar_point: し〜し (and; listing reasons)
  - term: 〜や〜など (listing examples)
    meaning: listing examples (e.g., and others)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜や〜など」 lists examples, implying there might be other unmentioned items. 「〜も〜ば〜も」, especially
      when only two items are listed, often implies that these two are the main or exhaustive focus, or
      at least two distinct examples that both apply.
    grammar_point: 〜など・〜なんか (listing examples)
  - term: 〜だけでなく (not only... but also)
    meaning: not only X, but also Y
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜だけでなく」 clearly states "not only X, but also Y." It explicitly presents Y as an addition
      to X. 「〜も〜ば〜も」 presents X and Y as more parallel or equally emphasized, often implying they are
      two aspects of the same thing or situation rather than one being an addition to the other.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜だけでなく (not only... but also)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「〜も〜ば〜も」 can sometimes be translated similarly to other listing or additive
  expressions, its unique characteristic lies in its emphasis on the coexistence or mutual applicability
  of the listed elements. It is less about sequence (like 「そして」) or providing reasons (like 「〜し〜し」), or
  just examples (like 「〜や〜など」). Instead, it highlights that both X and Y are equally true or equally occur,
  often describing a comprehensive state or a range of possibilities. 「〜だけでなく」 focuses on adding to a
  previous statement, whereas 「〜も〜ば〜も」 treats the elements more symmetrically.

        english: Hokkaido is cool in summer. And then, it snows in winter.
        hint: 「そして」 connects statements sequentially or adds information, but it does not emphasize the
          parallel existence of both conditions like 「も〜ば〜も」 does. We are emphasizing both aspects of
          Hokkaido's weather.

  them into their 「ば」 form or using the conditional 「なら」 for nouns and な-adjectives. This structure provides
  a natural and nuanced way to express 'both... and...' or 'sometimes... sometimes...' in Japanese, highlighting
  the coexistence of different qualities or occurrences.
