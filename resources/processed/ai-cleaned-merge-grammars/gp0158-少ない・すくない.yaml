        "Usage": "Used to indicate a small quantity or number. It cannot be used directly before a noun, except in relative clauses."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「少ない」 (sukunai) comes from the verb 「 শুকす」 (sukusu, now obsolete) meaning \"to diminish\" or \"to reduce.\" Over time, it evolved to describe a state where something is diminished in quantity or number.",
    "writeup": "「少ない・すくない」 is an い-adjective that means \"few,\" \"little,\" or \"a small number/quantity of something.\" It indicates that the amount or number of something is not abundant. **Important:** It is generally not used directly before a noun, but can be used in relative clauses where 「少ない」 is the predicate of the subject of the relative clause. For example, 「いいレストランが{少ない}町」 (ii resutoran ga {sukunai} machi - a town with few good restaurants). The antonym of 「少ない」 is 「多い」 (ooi - many, much).",
