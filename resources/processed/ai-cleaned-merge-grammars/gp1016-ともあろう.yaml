    "writeup": "`ともあろう` highlights a contradiction between someone's expected behavior and their actual actions. It suggests that a person or organization, given their status or abilities, should know better. The basic structure implies that \"even someone like A would do B,\" where B is unexpected or undesirable. Often, it expresses the speaker's opinion that A is failing to meet expectations. This pattern is used after nouns, sometimes followed by `が` or `ものが` for emphasis. Be cautious as it can be used sarcastically, especially toward someone of equal or lower standing. Context is key to understanding whether it's criticism or sarcasm.",
    "etymology": "This construction combines the case-marking particle `と` (to), the adverbial particle `も` (even), and the volitional form of the verb `ある` (aru), `あろう` (arou), meaning \"to be.\" The literal sense is akin to \"even a [noun] such as [person], would [unexpected action].\"",
