        "[Noun] + ともあろう": "Highlights a contradiction between someone's status/ability and their actions."

    },
    "etymology": "This construction combines the case-marking particle と (to), the adverbial particle も (even), and the volitional form of the verb ある (aru), あろう (arou), meaning \"to be.\" The literal sense is akin to \"even a [noun] such as [person], would [unexpected action].\"",
    "writeup": "「ともあろう」 highlights a contradiction between someone's expected behavior and their actual actions. It suggests that a person or organization, given their status or abilities, should know better. The basic structure implies that \"even someone like A would do B,\" where B is unexpected or undesirable. Often, it expresses the speaker's opinion that A is failing to meet expectations. This pattern is used after nouns, sometimes followed by **が** or **ものが** for emphasis. Be cautious as it can be used sarcastically, especially toward someone of equal or lower standing. Context is key to understanding whether it's criticism or sarcasm.",

                    "mitigation": "While 「～でも」 indicates that 'even' a famous artist can make a mistake, it lacks the strong implication of disappointment and the speaker's critical judgment that 「ともあろう」 conveys regarding the artist's high status."

                    "mitigation": "「～なのに」 highlights a contradiction ('despite being a famous artist, they made a mistake'), but it doesn't carry the same judgmental nuance or emphasize the societal expectation of someone in that position, which 「ともあろう」 does."
