    },
    "etymology": "This construction combines the case-marking particle と (to), the adverbial particle も (even), and the volitional form of the verb ある (aru), あろう (arou), meaning \"to be.\" The literal sense is akin to \"even a [noun] such as [person], would [unexpected action].\" It signifies that an action is unexpected or inappropriate for someone or something of a particular status or position. The nuance evolved to carry a strong sense of disapproval or irony, implying that the subject 'should know better' or 'is too important to behave that way.'",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「ともあろう」 emphasizes a significant discrepancy between an individual's expected conduct—given their high status, reputation, or capabilities—and their actual behavior. It conveys surprise, disappointment, or strong criticism that someone in such a position would act in an inappropriate or unexpected manner. This construction is primarily used after nouns to highlight that the subject, despite their esteemed role or apparent competence, has done something unexpected or undesirable. It strongly implies that the person \"should know better.\" While not restricted by gender or age, its usage often implies a judgment or criticism, which might be perceived differently depending on the social context and hierarchy involved. Context is key to understanding whether the sentiment is genuine criticism or veiled sarcasm.\n\n「ともあろう」 can be followed by a generalizing noun like 「人」 (hito, person), 「者」 (mono, person/thing), or 「方」 (kata, respectful person) to refer to the individual in question. Using 「もの」 can sometimes carry a slightly stronger, more critical, or even dismissive tone when referring to the subject's actions. For instance, 「～ともあろうものが」 intensifies the feeling that the action is particularly egregious coming from that specific person or entity. This phrase effectively sets up a contrast, leading the listener to expect a certain level of behavior that is then subverted by the described action, prompting a reaction of disbelief or disapproval.",
