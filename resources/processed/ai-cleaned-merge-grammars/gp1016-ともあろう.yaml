    "etymology": "This construction combines the case-marking particle と (to), the adverbial particle も (even), and the volitional form of the verb ある (aru), あろう (arou), meaning \"to be.\" The literal sense is akin to \"even a [noun] such as [person], would [unexpected action].\"",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「ともあろう」 emphasizes a significant discrepancy between an individual's expected conduct—given their high status, reputation, or capabilities—and their actual behavior. It conveys surprise, disappointment, or strong criticism that someone in such a position would act in an inappropriate or unexpected manner. \n\nThis construction is primarily used after nouns to highlight that the subject, despite their esteemed role or apparent competence, has done something unexpected or undesirable. It strongly implies that the person \"should know better.\" While not restricted by gender or age, its usage often implies a judgment or criticism, which might be perceived differently depending on the social context and hierarchy involved. Context is key to understanding whether the sentiment is genuine criticism or veiled sarcasm.\n\n「ともあろう」 can sometimes be followed by particles like が or ものが for added emphasis, further reinforcing the speaker's disbelief or disapproval. For instance, 「～ともあろうものが」 intensifies the feeling that the action is particularly egregious coming from that specific person or entity.",
