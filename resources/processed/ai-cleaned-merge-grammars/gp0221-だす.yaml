    "etymology": "The grammar point 「だす」 originates from the verb 「出す」 (dasu), which means \"to take out\" or \"to put out.\" The nuance of something emerging or becoming apparent is extended to indicate the sudden commencement of an action.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「だす」, written as 出す in kanji, is a verb that's added to the ます-stem (連用形) of another verb. It indicates the sudden or unexpected start of an action. Think of it as \"to burst into (A)\" or \"to suddenly do (A).\"\n\nTo form this construction, attach 「だす」 to the ます-stem of the verb.  For example, 走り(hashiri, run) + 「だす」 becomes 走り{だす} (hashiri dasu) \"to suddenly start running.\"\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   Unlike 「はじめる」 (hajimeru), which also means \"to begin\", 「だす」 often carries a nuance of being unintentional or something the subject can't control. 「はじめる」, on the other hand, implies a direct intention to start something.\n*   Consider the context carefully to choose between 「だす」 and 「はじめる」. 「だす」 is suited for spontaneous actions.",
