    "etymology": "「単位」 (tan'i) means \"unit\" or \"denomination.\" The particle 「で」 (de) indicates the means or method by which something is done. Thus, 「単位で」 literally means \"by means of units\" or \"in units of.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「単位で」 (tan'i de) is used to specify the unit or increment in which an action occurs, or by which something is measured, grouped, or sold. It delineates the smallest or standard division of a quantity, time, or category. This phrase is highly versatile, applicable across various contexts from financial transactions and academic analyses to daily purchases and organizational structures. It can be paired with numerical counters to denote specific quantities, such as 'in increments of 100 yen,' or with nouns to define a conceptual unit, such as 'by department' or 'per page.'",
