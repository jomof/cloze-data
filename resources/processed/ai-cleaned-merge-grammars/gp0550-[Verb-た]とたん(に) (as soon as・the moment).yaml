learn_before:
  - Verb[て] (and then)
id: gp0550
meaning: as soon as; the moment; right after
pronunciation:
  katakana: トタン ニ
  romaji: totan ni
formation:
  Verb[た形] + とたん(に): Used with the plain past form (た形) of a verb, followed by とたん or とたんに. It expresses
    that immediately after an action or event occurs, another sudden or unexpected event follows.
jlpt: N3
etymology: 'The term 「途端」(とたん) is composed of two kanji: 途 (to), meaning ''way'' or ''route'', and 端 (tan),
  meaning ''edge'' or ''end''. Historically, it refers to the very moment one thing ends and another begins,
  like reaching the ''end of a path'' or ''the edge of a moment''. When used with the particle 「に」, it
  emphasizes the precise point in time at which the second action immediately and often unexpectedly commences.'
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern 「〜た途端(に)」 (〜ta totan (ni)) is used to describe an event that happens immediately after another, often with a sense of suddenness or unexpectedness. It highlights that action B occurs at the precise moment action A finishes, making the connection feel abrupt or surprising. While it often implies a cause-effect relationship, the primary focus is on the unexpected immediacy of the second event.

  It is commonly used to express an unforeseen turn of events or something that happens almost simultaneously. The particle 「に」 can be omitted without changing the meaning, but its inclusion often adds a slight emphasis on the exact timing.

  - term: '[Verb-た]ばかり'
    meaning: just did; just finished
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜たばかり」 emphasizes that an action has just been completed, focusing on the recency of the
      action. It does not necessarily imply a sudden or unexpected subsequent event, unlike 「〜た途端(に)」.
    grammar_point: たばかり (just did)
  - term: 〜や否や
    meaning: as soon as; no sooner... than
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜や否や」 expresses extreme immediacy, almost as if the two actions are simultaneous. It is more
      formal and literary than 「〜た途端(に)」 and often implies a strong, almost automatic reaction or consequence,
      sometimes unexpected. The nuance of "no sooner... than" is very strong.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[dictionary]や否や (as soon as・no sooner than)
  - term: 〜が早いか
    meaning: as soon as; no sooner... than
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「〜や否や」, 「〜が早いか」 emphasizes the speed and almost simultaneous occurrence of the
      second action after the first. It often carries a nuance of surprise at how quickly the second event
      transpired, or a lack of time for any other action in between. It can be used for both intentional
      and unintentional actions.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[dictionary]が早いか (as soon as・no sooner than)
  - term: 〜なり
    meaning: as soon as; no sooner... than (same subject)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜なり」 indicates that the second action immediately follows the first, with a strong sense
      that the first action *triggers* the second. It implies an impulsive or reflexive action, usually
      performed by the *same subject* immediately after completing the first action. The second action
      is often unintentional or automatic.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[dictionary]なり (as soon as・same subject)
  - term: 〜次第
    meaning: as soon as; upon completion
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜次第」 means 'as soon as' but often implies a pre-planned or determined action that will take
      place upon the completion of the first. It lacks the element of suddenness or unexpectedness present
      in 「〜た途端(に)」, focusing instead on a set sequence.
    grammar_point: 次第 (as soon as)
  - term: '[Verb-た]ところ'
    meaning: just when; at the point when
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜たところ」 indicates that something *was discovered* or *found out* at the exact moment an action
      was completed. It highlights the timing of a realization or a new state, rather than a sudden, external
      event immediately following the first action.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-た]ところだ (just finished doing)'
  - term: 〜てから
    meaning: after; since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てから」 simply indicates a sequential relationship, meaning 'after X, then Y'. It does not
      carry the strong nuance of immediacy, suddenness, or unexpectedness that 「〜た途端(に)」 does. The time
      gap between actions can vary.
    grammar_point: てから (after and since)
  - term: 〜と同時に
    meaning: at the same time as; simultaneously
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜と同時に」 expresses that two actions or events occur at the exact same time, or one happens
      concurrently with the completion of another. While it implies close timing, it does not convey the
      unexpected or cause-effect suddenness of 「〜た途端(に)」.
    grammar_point: と同時に (at the same time as)
  - term: 〜かと思ったら・かと思うと
    meaning: no sooner... than; just when... then (unexpected succession)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜かと思ったら・かと思うと」 is very similar to 「〜た途端(に)」 in conveying an immediate, often surprising sequence
      of events. However, it often highlights a noticeable *shift* or *change* in situation, and can sometimes
      imply a slightly longer, though still quick, interval between the actions than 「〜た途端(に)」.
    grammar_point: かと思ったら・かと思うと (unexpected succession)
post_false_friends_writeup: While many of these expressions convey a sequence of events, 「〜た途端(に)」 specifically
  emphasizes the *suddenness* and often *unexpectedness* of the second event occurring immediately after
  the first. Pay close attention to the nuance of surprise and abruptness when choosing to use 「〜た途端(に)」.
