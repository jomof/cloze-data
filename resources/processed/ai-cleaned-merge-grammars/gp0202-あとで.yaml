    "etymology": "「あとで」 is formed from the noun 「後 (ato)」, meaning 'behind' or 'after', and the particle 「で (de)」, which indicates a state or a point in time/space. Historically, 「後」 refers to the physical 'back' or 'rear' of something. Its temporal meaning of 'after' likely evolved from the idea of something following behind another in sequence. The particle 「で」 serves to specify the condition or time at which the action in the main clause takes place, effectively meaning 'at the point of being after' or 'in the state of what follows'.",
    "writeup": "「あとで」 means \"after\" or \"later\" and is used to connect two events or actions, indicating that the second event occurs subsequent to the first. It can be attached to the plain past tense of a verb (e.g., 食べたあとで - *after eating*) or a noun followed by the particle 「の」 (e.g., 仕事のあとで - *after work*).\n\nA key nuance of 「あとで」 is that the second action doesn't necessarily happen immediately after the first. There can be a flexible time gap between the two events. This distinguishes it from expressions like 「～てから」, which often implies a more immediate or direct succession.\n\nAdditionally, 「あとで」 can be used adverbially at the beginning of a sentence (or standing alone) to mean \"later\" in a general sense, referring to an unspecified future time relative to the present moment. For example, 「あとで電話します」 means \"I'll call you later.\"",
