    "etymology": "「あとで」 is composed of 「後 (ato)」 meaning \"behind\" or \"after,\" and the particle 「で (de)」, indicating means or location. It literally describes something happening \"with\" or \"in the state of\" being after something else.",
    "writeup": "「あとで」 means \"after\" or \"later.\" It indicates that an action or event will occur following another action or event. It can be used after a verb in the past tense or a noun followed by 「の」. The nuance implies that the action will occur sometime after the preceding one, not necessarily immediately after. 「後で」 can also be placed at the beginning of a sentence to indicate that something will happen sometime after the present moment. It's a versatile expression for sequencing events.",
