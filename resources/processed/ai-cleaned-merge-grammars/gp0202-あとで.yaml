    "writeup": "The grammar point 「あとで」 combines the noun 「後 (ato)」 (behind, after) and the particle 「で (de)」 (with, at). Together, they form an adverbial phrase meaning \"after\" or \"later.\" Think of 「で」 as highlighting that something happens *with* the 'after' part of something else.\n\n「あとで」 typically follows a verb in the past, plain form, a noun followed by 「の」, or a verb followed by 「のは」 (nominalization). It can also be placed at the beginning of a sentence to indicate that something will happen at some point after now.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「あとで」 implies a time relationship; one action occurs after another. Be mindful of the sequence of events.",
    "etymology": "「後 (ato)」 signifies 'behind' or 'after,' indicating a temporal or spatial relationship following something else. 「で (de)」, as a particle, specifies the context or location where the action takes place. The combination implies 'at a point after' or 'with the consequence of being after.'",
