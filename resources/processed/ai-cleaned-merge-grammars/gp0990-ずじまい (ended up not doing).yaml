id: gp0990
meaning: Ended up not, Did not (in the end), Never did
pronunciation:
  katakana: ズジマイ
  romaji: zujimai
formation:
  Verb (未然形 / Indeterminate form) + ずじまい: Indicates that an action or state did not materialize or was
    left undone, often with a sense of regret or unfulfillment.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  usage-context: Used when an action was intended or planned but ultimately did not occur, resulting in
    a sense of regret or unfulfillment.
  function: Expresses that a situation concluded without an intended action being performed.
  nuance: Carries a nuance of regret, unfulfillment, or a missed opportunity, unlike simple negation.
etymology: The grammar point 「ずじまい」 combines 「ず」 (the classical negative auxiliary verb) with the conjunctive
  form 「じまい」 of the verb 「しまう」 (to finish, to end up). The 「ず」 negates the action of 「しまう」, indicating
  that something ended up not being completed or done. This combination very often leads to its use in
  the past form.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「ずじまい」 is formed by combining the classical negative auxiliary verb 「ず」 (meaning 'not') with the conjunctive form 「じまい」 of the verb 「しまう」. While 「しまう」 typically signifies 'to finish' or 'to bring to a close,' when paired with 「ず」, it creates a nuance of an action or event ultimately **not** having occurred or been completed, despite intentions or opportunities.

  This pattern inherently carries a sense of **regret, unfulfillment, or a missed opportunity**. It implies that something was supposed to happen, or was desired to happen, but for various reasons, it concluded without that action taking place.

  ### Formation
  「ずじまい」 attaches to the **indeterminate form (未然形)** of verbs. For instance, for the verb 「する」 (to do), it becomes 「せずじまい」, not 「しずじまい」. This irregular conjugation for 「する」 (which forms 「せず」 in negation) is an important point to remember.

  ### Usage and Nuance

  *   **Unfulfilled Intentions**: The primary use is to express that an action that was intended or planned ultimately did not happen. This often leads to a feeling of disappointment for the speaker.
  *   **Finality of Non-completion**: 「ずじまい」 is frequently used in the past tense, often followed by 「だった」 or 「でした」, to emphasize that the state of non-completion has become a finalized outcome. This underscores that a desired or expected action did not happen, leading to a sense of unfulfilled expectation or a missed opportunity.
  *   **Contrast with Simple Negation**: Unlike a simple negative statement (e.g., 「～なかった」), 「ずじまい」 adds an emotional layer, highlighting the speaker's regret or the unfortunate outcome of something not being done. It implies that the action *could* have been done, or was *intended* to be done, but ended up not being.

  Consider this phrase when you want to convey not just that something didn't happen, but that its non-occurrence is a source of disappointment or a definitive missed chance.

  - term: ～ないまま
    meaning: without doing (something)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～ないまま」 describes a state of affairs where an action is not performed or completed, but it
      does not inherently carry the nuance of regret or a sense of finality regarding an *intended* action.
      「ずじまい」 specifically highlights that an action was intended or expected but ultimately ended up not
      happening, often due to circumstances or one's own inaction, implying disappointment or unfulfillment.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb (without doing)
  - term: ～なかった
    meaning: did not do (simple past negative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～なかった」 is a direct, factual statement of non-completion in the past. It is neutral regarding
      intent or regret. 「ずじまい」 adds the layer that despite a potential desire, plan, or opportunity, the
      action simply never materialized by the time a certain period or situation concluded, emphasizing
      the outcome as an unfulfilled state.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb (did not do)
  - term: ～ることができなかった
    meaning: could not do (past potential negative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～ることができなかった」 explicitly states an *inability* to perform an action. 「ずじまい」 does not necessarily
      imply an inability, but rather that the action was left undone or never came to fruition, even if
      it was technically possible, often due to procrastination, change of circumstances, or simply letting
      the opportunity pass.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb (could not do)
post_false_friends_writeup: While similar in meaning, 「ずじまい」 carries a stronger emotional tone than 「～ないまま」,
  「～なかった」, or 「～ることができなかった」. It uniquely conveys the sense that an action was *intended* or *hoped for*
  but ultimately *failed to materialize* by the end of a process or period, leaving behind a feeling of
  regret or unfulfillment. Consider 「ずじまい」 when the nuance of a missed opportunity or an unfulfilled intention
  is crucial.

        english: Even though I met the person I admired at the party, I was too nervous and ended up without
          talking to them.
        hint: 「～ない まま」 simply states that an action wasn't performed. We're looking for a grammar point
          that vividly captures the common experience of missing a social opportunity due to shyness or
          nervousness, leading to regret.

        english: Even though I met the person I admired at the party, I was too nervous and didn't talk
          to them.
        hint: 「声をかけなかった」 is a neutral statement of non-action. We're looking for a grammar point that
          emphasizes the regret and frustration of having the opportunity but failing to act due to shyness,
          highlighting the unfulfilled desire for interaction.

        english: Even though I met the person I admired at the party, I was too nervous and couldn't talk
          to them.
        hint: 「～ることができなかった」 implies an inability to speak. We're looking for a grammar point that suggests
          the action was simply left undone or never came to fruition, even if it was technically possible,
          due to personal hesitation rather than an external impediment.
    scene: A young person recounts a missed social opportunity, emphasizing the personal frustration of
      shyness or anxiety.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「声をかけずじまい」 vividly captures the common experience of missing a social opportunity
      due to shyness or nervousness, leading to regret. This sentiment is particularly relatable for younger
      individuals. The speaker's gender often uses this more expressive form when discussing such personal
      frustrations.

        english: I started reading that book last year, but in the end, I didn't finish reading it.
        hint: 「読み終わらなかった」 is a neutral, factual statement of non-completion. We're looking for a grammar
          point that implies a sense of regret or unfulfilled intention despite starting the action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨年、あの 本 を 読み 始め た の です が、結局 読み {終え ない まま} だっ た。
        english: I started reading that book last year, but in the end, I ended up without finishing reading
          it.
        hint: 「～ない まま」 describes a state of affairs where an action is not performed or completed, but
          it does not inherently carry the nuance of regret over an intended action. We're looking for
          a grammar point that expresses a planned action that ultimately didn't happen, with a sense
          of regret.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨年、あの 本 を 読み 始め た の です が、結局 読み {終える こと が でき なかっ た}。
        english: I started reading that book last year, but in the end, I couldn't finish reading it.
        hint: 「～ることができなかった」 explicitly states an inability to perform an action. We're looking for a grammar
          point that implies the action was left undone or never came to fruition, even if it was technically
          possible, perhaps due to factors other than pure inability.
    scene: A student talks about their reading habits or a specific book they attempted to read.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: This example highlights the common regret of not completing an intended activity, specifically
      reading a book. The use of 「読み終えずじまい」 captures the unfulfilled intention and the lingering sense
      of incompleteness, a relatable sentiment for students with many demands on their time.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 「ずじまい」 effectively conveys a sense of regret
  or unfulfillment regarding an action that was intended or expected but ultimately did not occur. It's
  often used when reflecting on missed opportunities or unfinished tasks, adding an emotional depth beyond
  simple negation.
