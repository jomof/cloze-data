    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ばかりでなく」 is derived from 「ばかり」 meaning \"only\" or \"just,\" 「で」 which is the te-form of the copula 「だ」, and 「なく」, the negative form of 「ある」. It combines to express the idea of something being 'not only' one thing.",
    "writeup": "「ばかりでなく」 is used to express that something is 'not only A, but also B,' indicating addition or emphasis. It's similar to saying \"as well as\" in English. It combines the adverbial particle 「ばかり」 (meaning 'only'), the te-form of the auxiliary verb 「だ」, and the negative 「ない」.\n\n**Key variations include:** でなく, でなくて, ではなく, ではなくて, じゃなく, じゃなくて.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「ばかりでなく」 is more formal than 「だけでなく」. Use 「だけでなく」 in everyday conversations.",
