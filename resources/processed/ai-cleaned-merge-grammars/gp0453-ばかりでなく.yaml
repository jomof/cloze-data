        "[Noun] + ばかりでなく": "Indicates that something is 'not only...but also' or 'as well as'.",

    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ばかりでなく」 is derived from 「ばかり」 meaning \"only\" or \"just,\" 「で」 which is the te-form of the copula 「だ」, and 「なく」, the negative form of 「ある」. It combines to express the idea of something being 'not only' one thing.",
    "writeup": "「ばかりでなく」 is used to express that something is **not only A, but also B**, indicating an additional aspect or emphasis. It functions much like \"as well as\" in English.\n\n**Formation:**\n*   It combines the adverbial particle 「ばかり」, meaning \"only\" or \"just,\" with the te-form of the auxiliary verb 「だ」 (which becomes 「で」), and the negative form of the verb 「ある」 (which becomes 「なく」).\n*   Since 「ばかり」 is an adverbial particle, it can attach to nouns, verbs, and adjectives. For verbs and い-adjectives, the plain form is used. For な-adjectives, the な is dropped before attaching.\n\n**Variations:**\nThis grammar point can appear in several forms, reflecting different levels of formality or stylistic choices:\n*   **でなく:** The most basic form, often found in formal writing.\n*   **でなくて:** Adds a connective て-form, allowing for a pause or continuation.\n*   **ではなく:** Incorporates the particle 「は」 for emphasis on the negation.\n*   **ではなくて:** Combines the emphasis of 「は」 with the connective て-form.\n*   **じゃなく / じゃなくて:** These are more informal contractions of 「ではない」 / 「ではないて」.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「ばかりでなく」 is considered more formal than 「だけでなく」. Therefore, 「だけでなく」 will be encountered more frequently in everyday conversation and informal writing.\n*   The structure highlights that something is true in one respect, but also true in another, often surprising or significant, respect.",
