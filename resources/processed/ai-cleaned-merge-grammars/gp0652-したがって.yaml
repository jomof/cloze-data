        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used in formal speech and writing to introduce a logical consequence or conclusion. It conveys a stiff or hard tone, often found in academic, business, or official contexts.",
        "function": "Connects two sentences where the second sentence is a logical and necessary outcome or result of the first.",
        "nuance": "Implies a strong, necessary logical connection between cause and effect. It is more formal and objective than 「だから」, suggesting that the conclusion is indisputable given the preceding information."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「したがって」 comes from the て-form of the verb 従う (shitagau), which means \"to follow,\" \"to obey,\" or \"to comply with.\" As a conjunction, it retains the sense of 'following' logically from a previous statement or situation. This linguistic root emphasizes the direct and necessary consequence that 「したがって」 introduces.",
    "writeup": "「したがって」 is a formal conjunction used to indicate that a result or situation follows logically and necessarily from the preceding one. It functions similarly to \"therefore,\" \"thus,\" or \"as a result\" in English. It is typically employed in more objective, analytical, or formal contexts, such as academic writing, business reports, or official announcements. \n\nWhile 「だから」 can often be used to express a cause-and-effect relationship, 「したがって」 implies a more strict and logical deduction. The key distinction lies in formality and the perceived necessity of the consequence: 「したがって」 is always appropriate in formal settings where a clear, undeniable logical flow is required, whereas 「だから」 is more versatile and can be used in casual conversations as well as formal ones, but it doesn't always carry the same weight of logical necessity. \n\nA common pattern for 「したがって」 is to link two independent clauses, where the first clause states a fact or premise, and the second clause (beginning with 「したがって」) presents the logical conclusion or consequence of that premise. This makes it a powerful tool for structuring arguments or explanations.",
