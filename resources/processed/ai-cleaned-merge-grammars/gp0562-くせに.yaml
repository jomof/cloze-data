    "etymology": "The grammar point 「くせに」 combines the noun 「癖(くせ)」 meaning \"habit\" or \"tendency,\" often with a negative connotation, and the particle 「に」. It originally conveyed the idea of something being preferable, but now it expresses criticism when something doesn't align with that preferred state.",
    "writeup": "「くせに」 is used to express criticism, contempt, or disagreement towards someone's actions or state, similar to \"despite,\" \"even though,\" or \"and yet\" in English. Because 「くせ」 is a noun, 「くせに」 can be used after the attributive form (plain form) of verbs, い-adjectives, and nouns with 「の」 or な-adjectives with 「な」. This grammar point implies the speaker believes there is a contradiction or discrepancy between what is expected and what is actually happening.",
