    },
    "etymology": "The term 「癖 (くせ)」 originally referred to a personal inclination or preference, even a favorable one. Over time, its meaning shifted to denote a 'habit' or 'tendency,' often with a negative connotation, akin to a 'vice.' The particle 「に」, in this construction, highlights a state or condition. Thus, 「くせに」 conveys a sense of contradiction or incongruity: 'despite' or 'even though' something is the case, an unexpected or undesirable outcome or behavior occurs, leading to the speaker's criticism or dissatisfaction.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「くせに」 (usually written in hiragana) conveys the speaker's strong feelings of **contempt, anger, or disagreement** regarding someone's actions, behavior, or state. It is similar in meaning to \"even though,\" \"despite,\" \"and yet,\" or \"but\" in English, but always carries a distinct nuance of **blame or disapproval**. It highlights a contradiction: what is happening is contrary to what one would expect given a particular situation or characteristic.\n\n「くせに」 can attach to various word types:\n*   **Nouns**: Noun + 「のくせに」 (e.g., 子供のくせに - *even though you're a child*)\n*   **Verbs**: Verb in dictionary form (plain non-past) + 「くせに」 (e.g., 知っているくせに - *even though you know*)\n*   **い-adjectives**: い-adjective (plain form) + 「くせに」 (e.g., 弱い くせに - *even though you're weak*)\n*   **な-adjectives**: な-adjective stem + 「なくせに」 (e.g., 下手なくせに - *even though you're bad at something*)\n*   **Past tense**: Any of the above in plain past tense form + 「くせに」 (e.g., 学生だったくせに - *even though you were a student*)\n\nThis expression is typically used in **casual to semi-formal** contexts. It is not appropriate for formal business interactions or highly respectful speech. Its accusatory tone means it's generally directed towards peers, those younger, or in situations where expressing strong dissatisfaction is acceptable. It's often used when criticizing someone for failing to meet an expected standard or behaving inconsistently with their supposed status or abilities.",
