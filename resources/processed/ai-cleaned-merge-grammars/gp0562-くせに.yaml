    "writeup": "The grammar point 「くせに」 expresses the speaker's feelings of contempt, anger, or disagreement towards someone's actions, behavior, or state. It is similar in meaning to \"even though,\" \"despite,\" \"and yet,\" or \"but.\" It's used when something is contrary to what one would expect, given a particular situation or characteristic.  「くせに」 can be used after nouns (with 「の」), verbs in the dictionary form, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives (with 「な」). This grammar point often carries a nuance of blame or disapproval.",
