    "etymology": "The origin of やや is somewhat debated, but it's believed to have evolved from a reduplication of いや, meaning 'no' or 'not'. The repetition softened the negation into a slight affirmation, eventually leading to its current meaning of 'a little bit' or 'slightly'.",
    "writeup": "やや is an adverb used to express a small degree or extent. It is similar to 少し (sukoshi) or 僅か (wazuka), but やや often suggests that the difference or change, though small, is still perceptible. It can be translated as \"a little bit,\" \"slightly,\" or \"marginally.\"\n\n*   It's often used to describe changes, differences, or qualities that are noticeable but not significant.\n*   It commonly appears at the beginning or before the word it modifies in a sentence.",
