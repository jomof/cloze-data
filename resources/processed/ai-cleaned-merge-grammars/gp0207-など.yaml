    "etymology": "The word 「など」 can be written as 「等」. This kanji itself has a similar meaning to \"etc\" in English. The kanji for 「等」 is also used in the pluralizing suffix, 「ら」, further highlighting its function to indicate something exists as part of a larger group.",
    "writeup": "「など」 is an adverbial particle used to indicate that something is presented as an example, implying the existence of other items in the same category. It translates to \"such as,\" \"things like,\" or \"and so on.\" 「など」 can follow nouns to present (A) as an example from a larger group. Alternatively, 「など」 can be followed by 「の」 to show that (A) is one type of thing from the broader category (B). 「など」 is often written as 「等」. Sometimes 「など」 is written as 「なんか」, which has a similar meaning in many situations. However, 「なんか」 will never use the kanji form 「等」.",
