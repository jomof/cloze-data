    "etymology": "The term 「など」 originates from the kanji 「等」, which carries a similar meaning of 'etc.' or 'and so forth'. This kanji suggests that the item being mentioned is part of a larger, unstated group of similar things. 「等」 is also part of the pluralizing suffix 「ら」, reinforcing its role in indicating something as part of a larger set.",
    "writeup": "「など」 is an adverbial particle used to indicate that something is being presented as an example, implying that other similar items exist within the same category. It's often translated as \"such as,\" \"things like,\" or \"and so on.\" 「など」 can follow a noun to show that it is an example from a larger group, or it can be followed by 「の」 to indicate that the noun is one type from a broader category. While often written in hiragana, it can also appear as the kanji 「等」. Sometimes, 「など」 is written as 「なんか」, which is often interchangeable, but 「なんか」 never uses the kanji form.",

If the examples are particularly relevant, 「とか〜とか」 may be suitable."
