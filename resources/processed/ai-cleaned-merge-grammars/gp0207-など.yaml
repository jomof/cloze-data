        "colocation": "Typically follows nouns or noun phrases."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「など」 originates from the kanji 「等」, which carries a similar meaning of 'etc.' or 'and so forth'. This kanji suggests that the item being mentioned is part of a larger, unstated group of similar things. 「等」 is also part of the pluralizing suffix 「ら」, reinforcing its role in indicating something as part of a larger set.",
    "writeup": "「など」 is an adverbial particle primarily used to indicate that something is being presented as an example, implying that other similar items exist within the same category but are not explicitly listed. It is commonly translated as \"such as,\" \"things like,\" or \"and so on.\" This particle is versatile and can be used in both formal and informal contexts.\n\nWhen 「など」 directly follows a noun, it suggests that this noun is one instance among a broader collection of similar items. For example, in 「リンゴなど」, it means \"apples and such,\" implying other fruits. Alternatively, 「など」 can be followed by 「の」 (as in 「サッカーなどの球技」), which indicates that the preceding noun (soccer) is one type from a broader category (ball games).\n\nWhile 「など」 is frequently written in hiragana, its kanji form 「等」 (とう) is also commonly used, especially in formal or written contexts. This kanji inherently carries the meaning of 'etc.' or 'and so forth,' aligning with the particle's function of indicating a non-exhaustive list. Interestingly, the kanji 「等」 is also found in the pluralizing suffix 「ら」 (as in 「彼ら」 meaning \"they\"), further emphasizing its association with groups or collections of things. This linguistic connection highlights 「など」's role in conveying that a mentioned item is part of a larger, unspecified set.\n\nIt is worth noting that 「など」 is sometimes used interchangeably with 「なんか」, particularly in casual conversation. However, 「なんか」 often carries a more casual or even dismissive nuance, and it does not use the kanji form 「等」.",
