    "etymology": "「をもって」 comes from the kanji 「以て」 (もって), which originally meant \"by means of.\" It's related to the verb 「持つ」 (もつ), meaning \"to hold\" or \"to have.\" The nuance suggests \"having reached (A)\" or \"by means of (A)\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「をもって」 is a formal expression that can mean \"as of,\" \"with,\" or \"by means of.\" It's often used in official announcements, formal speech, and written documents. When used with expressions indicating time or an event at a specific time, it conveys 'as of (A)' or 'effective from (A)'. For example, 「本日をもって」 means \"as of today.\" It is a combination of the adverbial particle 「を」 and 「もって」, which originally meant \"by means of.\" In highly polite or official contexts, it may be rendered as 「をもちまして」. Less commonly, the small っ (促音, sokuon) may be dropped, resulting in 「をもて」. It is crucial to note that while \"effective from\" might imply a starting point in English, 「をもって」 primarily focuses on the **ending** or **completion** of something, or what has happened up until a specified end date. Therefore, it is generally **not** used to indicate a new beginning from a date that lacked prior significant events.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「によって」, 「で」, and 「から」 can sometimes seem similar to 「をもって」, it's important to remember that 「をもって」 is primarily used in formal contexts to mark the end of something or to indicate the specific means by which something is achieved, often with a sense of finality or completeness. 「によって」 focuses more on causation, dependence, or passive agents. 「で」 is a more general marker of location, time, or means without the elevated formality of 「をもって」. 「から」, in contrast, typically denotes a starting point or origin, making it distinct from 「をもって」's emphasis on conclusion.",
