        "Register": "Standard Japanese.",
        "Usage": "Used to express understanding or comprehension of something. It describes the state of knowing rather than the action of learning. It can also imply being able to figure out various facts such as content, nature, value, meaning, cause, reason, or result.",
        "Nuance": "This verb refers to understanding something spontaneously or realizing something. It describes a state of knowing rather than the process of learning. Often used with the particle 「が」 to indicate the subject being understood."
    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「分かる」 originates from the verb 「分ける (wakeru)」, meaning \"to divide\" or \"to separate.\" The connection comes from the idea that understanding something involves breaking it down into smaller parts or distinguishing its components. Over time, 「分ける」 evolved to imply the ability to discern and comprehend, leading to the development of 「分かる」 as a verb for understanding.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「分かる (wakaru)」 means \"to understand,\" \"to comprehend,\" or \"to know.\" It describes a state of knowing or understanding rather than the action of learning. It's often used with the particle 「が」 to indicate the subject that is understood. 「分かる」 is intransitive, meaning it does not take a direct object. The person who understands usually takes the particle 「に」 or 「は」. In the negative form, 「分からない (wakaranai)」, it expresses not understanding or not knowing. The polite forms are 「分かります (wakarimasu)」 and 「分かりません (wakarimasen)」. It's **important** to note the difference between 「分かる」 and 「知る (shiru)」. 「知る」 means \"to know\" in the sense of being aware of something, while 「分かる」 means \"to understand\" or \"comprehend\" the meaning or details of something.",
