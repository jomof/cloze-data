  romaji: katawara

  Noun + の + かたわら: Indicates a secondary activity or state existing alongside a primary noun-related context.
  Verb (dictionary form) + かたわら: Indicates a secondary activity or state existing alongside a primary
    verb-related action.
jlpt: N1
etymology: The word 「傍ら」(かたわら) originally means 'side' or 'nearby'. It indicates something that exists
  or happens alongside something else, but is not the primary focus. This nuance is retained in the grammar
  point, where the action or state described by 「かたわら」 is secondary to the main action. It conveys the
  sense of 'being at the side of' or 'doing something alongside' the main activity.
writeup: "「かたわら」 (傍ら), typically written in hiragana, is a versatile grammatical construction used to\
  \ express that something occurs **in addition to**, **besides**, or **while** another primary activity\
  \ or state is ongoing. It implies a secondary or incidental action that complements a main pursuit,\
  \ often describing a side job, hobby, or additional responsibility. \n\n**Formation:** \n*   It attaches\
  \ to nouns followed by `の` (e.g., `本業の かたわら` - \"besides one's main job\"). \n*   It attaches to verbs\
  \ in their dictionary form (e.g., `研究する かたわら` - \"while researching\"). \n\n**Nuance and Usage:** \n\
  The core nuance of `かたわら` stems from its original meaning of \"bystander\" or \"alongside.\" The action\
  \ or state preceding `かたわら` is considered the primary focus, with the action or state that follows being\
  \ secondary, incidental, or a supplementary activity. This often highlights someone balancing multiple\
  \ roles or responsibilities, with one clearly being their main endeavor. It suggests a sustained, ongoing\
  \ secondary activity, not merely a fleeting simultaneous action. \n\n**Important Considerations:** \n\
  Unlike `ながら`, which strongly implies two actions happening simultaneously (e.g., `テレビを見ながら食べる` - \"\
  eat while watching TV\"), `かたわら` does not necessarily mean the actions are occurring at the exact same\
  \ moment. Instead, it describes a situation where one activity exists or is performed *in the context\
  \ of* another primary one, even if they are not temporally overlapping at every instant. For example,\
  \ a person might work their main job during the day and pursue a hobby or side business in the evenings\
  \ or weekends. Both are ongoing aspects of their life, but one is clearly the main focus. \n\nThis structure\
  \ is generally used in **formal** or **literary** contexts and adds a sophisticated tone. It's often\
  \ found in biographical descriptions, academic papers, or formal speeches."

  - term: ながら
    meaning: While ~ing, During, As
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ながら」 indicates two actions happening simultaneously. Unlike 「かたわら」, which suggests one action
      is primary and another secondary or incidental, 「ながら」 implies both actions occur at the same time
      and often with equal emphasis, or one directly accompanying the other.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]ながら・つつ (while doing)'
  - term: 一方で
    meaning: On the other hand, At the same time, While
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「一方で」 emphasizes a contrast or simultaneous existence of two distinct aspects. While it can
      suggest two things happening at once, it often highlights a dual nature or a 'on the one hand...
      on the other hand' scenario, which differs from 「かたわら」's focus on one activity being supplementary
      to a primary one.
    grammar_point: 一方で (on the other hand・while)
  - term: と共に
    meaning: Together with, at the same time as, as well as
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「と共に」 generally indicates actions or states occurring simultaneously or in conjunction, often
      implying a more equal or collaborative relationship between them. Unlike 「かたわら」, it does not typically
      highlight one activity as primary and the other as a sustained, secondary pursuit.
    grammar_point: と共に (together with)
  - term: に加えて
    meaning: In addition to; not only... but also; moreover; what's more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に加えて」 simply adds another item or piece of information. It does not carry the nuance of a
      sustained secondary activity existing alongside a primary one, which is central to 「かたわら」.
    grammar_point: それに (in addition・moreover)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「かたわら」, 「ながら」, 「一方で」, 「とともに」, and 「に加えて」 all express the co-occurrence
  or addition of actions or states, their nuances are distinct. 「ながら」 indicates two actions performed
  genuinely simultaneously, often by the same subject. 「一方で」 highlights contrasting or parallel aspects,
  similar to 'on the one hand... on the other hand'. 「とともに」 emphasizes joint action or simultaneous occurrence,
  often implying equality between the elements. 「に加えて」 simply lists an additional item or factor without
  the continuous, secondary activity implication of 「かたわら」. In contrast, 「かたわら」 specifically denotes a
  **sustained, secondary activity** that exists **alongside** a more primary, ongoing pursuit, clearly
  distinguishing the main endeavor from the complementary one.

          - 彼女 は 会社 員 {ながら}、週末 は ボランティア 活動 を し て いる。
        english: While she is a company employee, she volunteers on weekends.
        hint: While she might volunteer on weekends, 「ながら」 suggests both being an employee and volunteering
          happen at the exact same time. We're looking for an activity that occurs alongside her main
          job, not necessarily at the same moment.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 会社 員 で ある {一方 で}、週末 は ボランティア 活動 を し て いる。
        english: She is a company employee, but on the other hand, she volunteers on weekends.
        hint: 「一方で」 highlights two distinct aspects or contrasts them, but here we want to show one activity
          as supplementary to a primary one. We're looking for an activity that is in addition to her
          main job.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 会社 員 {に 加え て}、週末 は ボランティア 活動 を し て いる。
        english: She volunteers on weekends in addition to being a company employee.
        hint: 「に加えて」 simply states an addition. 「かたわら」 emphasizes that one activity (volunteering) is
          a sustained secondary pursuit alongside a primary one (company employee).
    scene: Describing a woman who effectively balances her main job with altruistic activities.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The speaker, an older man, uses this formal phrasing to commend her dedication. 「会社員 の かたわら」
      highlights that her main identity is a company employee, with volunteering being a notable but secondary
      pursuit. This mirrors the original meaning of 傍ら as something alongside but not central, highlighting
      her commitment to both roles without blurring the line between them. It is not about simultaneous
      actions, but rather, one being in addition to the other.
    etymology: The use of 「かたわら」 in this example emphasizes the distinction between her primary occupation
      and her additional volunteer work, much like how the word 'side' or 'alongside' implies a supplementary
      role rather than a concurrent one. It underscores the dedication required to manage both aspects
      of her life effectively, lending a sense of admirable effort to her character.
  - english: While teaching at the university, Professor Tanaka continues to publish numerous research
      papers.

        english: Professor Tanaka teaches at the university and, at the same time, continues to publish
          numerous research papers.
        hint: 「同時に」 implies strict simultaneity. While publishing may happen alongside teaching, it's
          not always happening at the exact same moment. We're looking for an ongoing secondary activity
          alongside a primary one.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 田中 教授 は 大学 で 教える {と とも に}、数多く の 研究 論文 を 発表 し 続け て いる。
        english: Professor Tanaka teaches at the university, and along with that, continues to publish
          numerous research papers.
        hint: 「と共に」 implies actions occurring in conjunction, often with a sense of equality. 「かたわら」 distinguishes
          teaching as primary and publishing as a sustained, secondary activity.
    scene: Discussing Professor Tanaka's impressive academic career.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: This usage emphasizes Professor Tanaka's dedication to both teaching, which is a primary duty,
      and research, which is an additional, ongoing contribution. 「教える かたわら」 suggests that even with the
      demands of teaching, he maintains his research output. This shows an admirable commitment to both
      aspects of his profession.
    etymology: The etymological root of 'side' in 「かたわら」 is evident here. Teaching is the central, 'front-and-center'
      activity, while research is performed 'alongside' or 'on the side,' yet still continuously and significantly.

        english: Despite being a diplomat, he wrote several acclaimed novels.
        hint: 「にもかかわらず」 emphasizes a contrast or unexpectedness. Here, we want to highlight that novel
          writing was an additional activity, not necessarily surprising given his diplomatic role. We're
          looking for something that occurred as a supplementary role.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 外交 官 で ある {と とも に}、いく つ か の 高い 評価 を 受け た 小説 を 書い た。
        english: He was a diplomat, and along with that, he wrote several acclaimed novels.
        hint: While 「とともに」 expresses joint occurrence, it doesn't emphasize the primary/secondary relationship
          between diplomacy and writing that 「かたわら」 conveys. We're looking for a grammar point that suggests
          one role is primary and the other is a continuous, side pursuit.
    scene: A biographical account of a multi-talented public figure.
    register: formal
    setting: storytelling
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「外交官 の かたわら」 points out that diplomacy was his main profession, and writing novels was a secondary,
      yet notable and successful, endeavor. It suggests a balance of two significant life paths, with
      one being the primary public role. This phrasing elevates the impressive nature of his achievement,
      showing his ability to excel in two demanding fields.
    etymology: This example highlights the 'secondary but important' aspect of 「かたわら」. His role as a diplomat
      was his primary identity, but his literary pursuit was a consistent 'side' activity that brought
      him recognition, fitting the original sense of 'alongside' a main function.

        english: She dedicates time to medical research along with clinical practice.
        hint: 「とともに」 implies an equal partnership or accompaniment. Here, clinical practice is typically
          the primary role. We're looking for a secondary activity that is pursued alongside the main
          one.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 臨床 {に 加え て}、医学 研究 に 時間 を 捧げ て いる。
        english: She dedicates time to medical research in addition to clinical practice.

          secondary activity alongside her primary clinical practice.
    scene: Discussing a doctor's contributions to medicine beyond her daily patient care.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「臨床 の かたわら」 emphasizes that her clinical work is her main professional identity, while medical
      research is a significant, ongoing, but secondary commitment. It reflects a sustained effort to
      contribute to both areas. This phrasing conveys respect for her dedication to both direct patient
      care and scientific advancement.
    etymology: Similar to the other examples, the 'side' meaning of 「かたわら」 comes through. Clinical practice
      is the central activity, and research is an important endeavor pursued 'on the side' of her main
      professional duties, indicating a continuous commitment.
  - english: My grandfather worked as a farmer and, at the same time, was also a village elder respected

        english: My grandfather was farming, but on the other hand, he was also a village elder respected
          by everyone.
        hint: 「一方で」 can imply a contrast. While there might be a subtle contrast between physical labor
          and community leadership, the main idea is that he held both roles concurrently and continuously.
          We're looking to emphasize the concurrent pursuit of two distinct roles.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 祖父 は 農業 {と とも に}、皆 に 尊敬 さ れる 村 の 長老 で も あっ た。
        english: My grandfather worked in agriculture, and along with that, he was a village elder respected
          by everyone.
        hint: 「とともに」 indicates two things happening together, but 「かたわら」 specifically highlights farming
          as his primary livelihood and being an elder as a continuous, secondary role. We're looking
          to emphasize the concurrent pursuit of two distinct roles, with one being primary.
    scene: A grandchild fondly describing their late grandfather's life and roles in the community.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「農業 の かたわら」 highlights that farming was his primary livelihood, but being a village elder
      was another significant, ongoing role he performed concurrently. This shows respect for his dual
      contributions to both his family's sustenance and community welfare. It evokes the image of a steadfast
      individual who managed multiple, important responsibilities.
    etymology: This example emphasizes the dual, continuous roles of the grandfather. Farming was his
      livelihood, his 'main' occupation, but being a village elder was an active, consistent 'side' role,
      reinforcing the idea of a supplementary but equally important continuous activity.

        english: While doing exam studying, you should also do moderate exercise.
        hint: 「ながら」 suggests doing both at the exact same time, which is not usually the case for studying
          and exercise. We want to convey that exercise is a healthy, ongoing activity to do *in addition*
          to studying. We're looking for an additional, sustained activity.

        english: In addition to studying for exams, you should also do moderate exercise.

          secondary activity alongside the primary study focus, emphasizing balance.

    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「試験勉強 する かたわら」 suggests that exam study is the primary focus, but regular exercise should
      be a sustained, secondary activity that supports overall well-being. This advice emphasizes balancing
      demanding tasks with self-care, where the exercise is 'alongside' the main study effort, not strictly
      simultaneous.
    etymology: Here, 「かたわら」 denotes a beneficial 'side' activity that supports the main endeavor. Studying
      is primary, but exercise, while secondary in focus, is a continuous activity that runs alongside
      and contributes to the student's overall success and health.

          working part-time at a cafe.
        hint: The 'even while' nuance of 「ながらも」 implies a stronger sense of overcoming difficulty. 「かたわら」
          here means the part-time work is simply an additional, necessary activity to sustain his art.

          frames the cafe work as a consistent secondary activity, not just a fact that exists despite
          the struggle. We're looking for a sustained secondary activity that supports the primary one.

    register: formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female

      and his cafe work is a supplementary activity undertaken to support his artistic passion. It evokes
      a sense of enduring dedication despite hardship, with the cafe work existing 'alongside' his primary
      artistic identity.
    etymology: This use of 「かたわら」 illustrates an unavoidable 'side' activity necessary for survival, pursued
      in parallel with one's main passion. The struggle as an artist is the 'primary' reality, and the
      cafe work is a persistent 'adjacent' activity to make ends meet.

          in various community events.
        hint: 「一方で」 highlights contrasting or parallel aspects. While his duties and community work are
          distinct, 「かたわら」 emphasizes the community involvement as a consistent secondary activity complementing
          his main role. We're looking for a grammar point that suggests one role is primary and the other
          is a continuous, side pursuit.

      life.
    etymology: Here, 「かたわら」 conveys the idea of continuous community engagement as an 'additional' or
      'side' role that complements the mayor's main official duties. It's not a one-off event but an ongoing
      aspect of his public service.

      dedication, portraying the youth development as an ongoing effort existing 'alongside' his main
      academic pursuit. This shows a holistic commitment to his field.
    etymology: This usage of 「かたわら」 illustrates the continuous nature of a secondary but important activity—nurturing
      young talent—that runs parallel to the primary focus of personal research. It shows a dedication
      that extends beyond his immediate scholarly work.
  - english: Even while pursuing his dream of becoming a professional musician, he worked a full-time
      job to support himself.
    japanese:
      - プロ の 音楽 家 を 目指す {かたわら}、生活 の ため に フル タイム で 働い て い た。

      - 音楽 家 と し て の 夢 を 追う {かたわら}、自活 の ため に 会社 勤め を し て い た。

      - competing_japanese:
          - プロ の 音楽 家 を 目指す {が}、生活 の ため に フル タイム で 働い て い た。
        english: He aims to be a professional musician, but he works full-time for his livelihood.
        hint: Using a simple 'but' (が) does not convey the continuous, sustained nature of the two activities
          happening in parallel. We're looking for a grammar point that shows one activity exists alongside
          the other.
      - competing_japanese:
          - プロ の 音楽 家 を 目指す こと {と とも に}、生活 の ため に フル タイム で 働い て い た。
        english: Along with pursuing his dream of becoming a professional musician, he worked full-time
          to support himself.
        hint: 「とともに」 implies that two activities happen concurrently, often with a sense of equal importance.
          「かたわら」 specifically conveys that one activity (the job) is a necessary, continuous secondary
          activity supporting the primary one (pursuing music). We're looking for a grammar point that
          shows one activity exists alongside the other, with a primary/secondary relationship.

    nuance: 「プロ の 音楽家 を 目指す かたわら」 indicates that his musical ambition is the primary, overarching goal,
      while his full-time job is a continuous, necessary 'side' activity that enables him to pursue that
      dream. It emphasizes the balance and dedication required for such a demanding path. This expresses
      admiration for his perseverance.
    etymology: This example clearly shows how 「かたわら」 is used to describe a primary ambition—becoming a
      professional musician—and a continuous, necessary 'side' activity—working a full-time job—that exists
      in parallel to support that ambition. It highlights the dual paths being pursued simultaneously.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「かたわら」 is particularly useful for describing individuals
  who balance a main role or activity with a significant, ongoing secondary pursuit. It highlights their
  dedication to both, with a clear distinction of what constitutes the primary focus.
