jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: casual
  function: Transforms an い-adjective into an adverb, allowing it to modify verbs, other adjectives, or
    adverbs. It primarily expresses the manner, degree, or resulting state of an action or condition.
  nuance: The い-adjective becomes a descriptive modifier for an action or a state of being, shifting its
    role from directly describing a noun to describing 'how' or 'to what extent' something is done or
    becomes.
  grammatical-role: Adverbial modifier.
etymology: The 『く』 ending for い-adjectives is a remnant of Classical Japanese grammar, where it functioned
  as the adverbial form (連用形 - ren'yōkei) of adjectives. This ancient form allowed adjectives to directly
  modify verbs, a role now primarily fulfilled by adverbs. This historical continuity explains why い-adjectives,
  unlike な-adjectives, transform with 『く』 to describe actions or changes in state.
writeup: |-
  The い-Adjective『く』form converts an い-adjective into an adverb. This transformation allows the adjective to modify verbs, describing *how* an action is performed, or to modify other adjectives and adverbs, indicating *to what extent* something is.

  It is most commonly seen modifying verbs such as 『なる』 (to become) or 『する』 (to do/to make). When used with 『なる』, it expresses a change of state, for example, 『暗く なる』 (to become dark). When modifying other verbs, it describes the manner of the action, such as 『速く 走る』 (to run fast).

  - term: い-Adjective (connecting and adverbial form)
    meaning: describes an action or connects clauses
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both use the 『く』 form, this grammar point specifically focuses on the modification of
      a verb or another adverb/adjective within a single phrase to describe *how* something is done or
      *to what extent*. The 'connecting and adverbial form' often extends to linking multiple clauses,
      sometimes providing a reason or sequential action.

  - term: な-Adjective + に
    meaning: to (do something) in a [na-adjective] way
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This highlights the fundamental difference in how い-adjectives and な-adjectives form adverbs.
      い-adjectives use 『く』, while な-adjectives use 『に』.
    grammar_point: に (adverbializer)
  - term: い-adjective (sentence-ending)
    meaning: is [i-adjective] (predicate use)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: The sentence-ending form directly describes a noun, functioning as the predicate of a sentence
      (e.g., 『この 本 は 面白い』 - This book is interesting). In contrast, the adverbial 『く』 form modifies a
      verb or another adverb/adjective, describing *how* something is done or becomes (e.g., 『彼 は 面白く
      話す』 - He speaks interestingly).
    grammar_point: い-adjective (sentence-ending)
post_false_friends_writeup: It is common for learners to confuse the adverbial 『く』 form of い-adjectives
  with their predicate (sentence-ending) forms or with the adverbialization of な-adjectives. Remember,
  the 『く』 form transforms an い-adjective into something that describes *how* an action occurs or *what*
  something becomes, acting like an English adverb. The simple い-adjective at the end of a sentence simply
  states what something *is*. For な-adjectives, the adverbial change is made by adding 『に』, not 『く』.

    scene: Concluding a fairy tale to a group of children.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: While 『幸せ』 is a な-adjective and uses 『に』 as an adverb, this example illustrates the *function*
      of an adverbial form to describe how a verb is performed, which is the core concept this grammar
      point conveys. It's important to differentiate 『い』 and 『な』 adjective adverbialization.

          - 正しい 生き 方 は 大切 だ。
        english: A correct way of living is important.
        hint: We are describing *how* to live, using the adverbial form of 'correct', rather than using
          it as an adjective to modify 'way of living'.
    scene: You are discussing life principles with a close friend.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
post_example_writeup: Notice how the 『く』 form always precedes the verb or adjective it modifies, functioning
  like an adverb in English. This simple transformation is fundamental for expressing the manner or degree
  of actions and states in Japanese.
