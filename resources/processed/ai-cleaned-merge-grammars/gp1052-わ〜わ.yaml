    "etymology": "The particle 「わ」 is considered an emphatic version of 「は」, an adverbial particle. It emphasizes the speaker's surprise or strong feelings about the amount or extent of something.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「わ〜わ」 is an adverbial expression used to emphasize the quantity, frequency, or degree of actions or states. It is frequently employed to convey the speaker's surprise, admiration, or a feeling of being overwhelmed by a situation. It can generally be translated as \"and... and...\", \"keeps ...ing\", \"one after another\", \"so much/many\", or \"a great deal of...\".\n\nThis pattern is most commonly used by repeating a verb in its dictionary form, with 「わ」 placed after each instance. When used with する-verbs, the second instance of the verb is often shortened to just 「する」. While this structure is used by both men and women, it is observed more frequently in male spoken Japanese. It is important to note that the particle 「わ」 has various usages and gender-specific tendencies depending on its position within a sentence, which require careful study.",
