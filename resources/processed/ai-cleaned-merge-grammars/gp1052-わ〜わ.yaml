    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「わ」 is considered an emphatic version of 「は」, an adverbial particle. It emphasizes the speaker's surprise or strong feelings about the amount or extent of something.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「わ〜わ」 is an adverbial expression that conveys strong emphasis on the quantity, frequency, or degree of actions or states. It often expresses the speaker's surprise, admiration, or a feeling of being overwhelmed by a situation. It can be translated as “and... and...”, “keeps...ing”, “so much/many”, or “one after another”. It can also be used to list multiple reasons or events contributing to a particular outcome.\n\nThere are two main patterns:\n\n1.  **Repeating the same verb/adjective:** This form emphasizes the extreme extent or continuous nature of a single action or state. For regular verbs and i-adjectives, the dictionary form is used, followed by 「わ」, then the same dictionary form again followed by 「わ」. For する verbs, the second instance of the verb is often shortened, becoming 「〜するわするわ」. This pattern strongly conveys the speaker's feeling about the sheer volume or intensity.\n\n2.  **Listing different clauses/reasons:** This pattern connects two or more different clauses (S1 and S2) in their plain forms, often presenting them as cumulative reasons or concurrent events that lead to a particular situation, frequently a negative one. This can include nouns followed by 「だわ」 or な-adjectives followed by 「だわ」.\n\nWhile this structure is used by both men and women, it is observed more frequently in male spoken Japanese. It is important to note that the particle 「わ」 has various usages and gender-specific tendencies depending on its position within a sentence, which require careful study.",
