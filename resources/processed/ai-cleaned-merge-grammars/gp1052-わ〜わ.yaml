    "etymology": "The particle 「わ」 is considered an emphatic version of 「は」, an adverbial particle. It emphasizes the speaker's surprise or strong feelings about the amount or extent of something.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「わ〜わ」 は、行動や状態の量、頻度、または程度を強調するために用いられる副詞的な表現です。話し手の驚き、感嘆、あるいは状況に圧倒されている感情を伝える際によく使用されます。おおよそ「～と～と」「～し続ける」「次から次へと」「非常に多くの～」「大変な～」といった意味合いで訳されます。\n\nこのパターンは、動詞の辞書形に「わ」を付けて繰り返し使用されることが最も一般的です。「する」動詞と共に用いる場合、二度目の動詞は「する」のみに短縮されることがよくあります。この構造は男女共に使用されますが、男性の話し言葉でより多く見受けられます。文中のどこに置かれるかによって「わ」には様々な用法や性別による傾向があるため、注意深く学習する必要があります。",
