    "etymology": "「わ」 is an emphatic version of the adverbial particle 「は」, originating from 「は」 changing to 「わ」. The literal meaning can be interpreted as a stronger version of the standard 'as for (A)' meaning of 「は」. Therefore, the structure 「わ〜わ」 implies a stronger emphasis on the repetition of an action or state.",
    "writeup": "The 「わ〜わ」 structure is used to emphasize the speaker's surprise or strong feeling about an action or state that is happening repeatedly or to a great extent. It is similar to saying \"and...and...\" in English to express something happening one after another. It can be used both positively and negatively.\n\nTo use this structure, simply place 「わ」 after a verb in dictionary form, and then repeat the same verb with another 「わ」. For example, 勉強するわ勉強するわ (benkyou suru wa benkyou suru wa) would mean \"study and study,\" implying studying a lot. When used with a する verb, the second instance of する is often omitted, becoming 勉強するわするわ (benkyou suru wa suru wa).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   This structure often conveys the speaker's surprise regarding the quantity or extent of something.\n*   While both men and women can use this structure, it is predominantly used by men. Other variations of 「わ」 have different gender-specific usage tendencies.",
