    "etymology": "The particle 「わ」 is considered an emphatic version of 「は」, an adverbial particle. It emphasizes the speaker's surprise or strong feelings about the amount or extent of something.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「わ〜わ」is an adverbial particle construction used to emphasize the quantity, frequency, or degree of something. It's typically used to express the speaker's surprise, amazement, or being overwhelmed by the situation. It translates roughly to \"and... and...\", \"keeps...ing\", \"one after another\", or \"so much/many\".\n\n*   It is often used with verbs in dictionary form, repeated with 「わ」after each instance.\n*   With 「する」 verbs, the second verb is often shortened to just 「する」.\n*   While both men and women can use this, it is more predominantly used by men. Be aware that 「わ」 has different usages and gender associations depending on its placement in a sentence.",
