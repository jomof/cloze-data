    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ようと・が」 is derived from the volitional form 「よう」, indicating intent or attempt, combined with 「と」, a conditional particle, and 「が」, a conjunction indicating contrast or concession. Together, they create a structure that concedes a hypothetical situation without altering the main clause's outcome.",
    "writeup": "The 「ようと・が」 grammar point is employed to express concession, meaning \"even if,\" \"no matter what,\" or \"whether X or Y.\" It is commonly encountered in formal speech and writing, signaling that a given condition or circumstance will not influence the ultimate outcome or action. It asserts, \"Regardless of what happens, this main point remains true.\"\n\nThis construction attaches to the volitional form of verbs. For い-adjectives, the stem is followed by 「かろう」. For な-adjectives and nouns, it uses 「だろう」 or the more formal 「であろう」. In all cases, the phrase concludes with 「と」 or 「が」, often used interchangeably, though 「が」 can sometimes add a slightly stronger emphasis on the disregard for the condition. The overall structure firmly establishes that the preceding clause's content is irrelevant to the main clause's assertion.",
