    "etymology": "The grammatical construction 「することができる」 is derived from combining the nominalizer 「こと」 (koto, meaning 'thing' or 'matter'), the subject particle 「が」, and the verb 「できる」 (dekiru, meaning 'to be able to' or 'to be possible'). Literally, it translates to \"the matter/thing is possible\" or \"the matter/thing can be done\". This structure allows for a noun clause (formed by the verb in plain form followed by こと) to become the subject of 「できる」, thus expressing the potential or possibility of that entire action or state. This explicit nominalization differentiates it from simpler potential verb forms like 「～れる/られる」.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「することができる」 is a fundamental expression used to convey **ability** or **possibility** in Japanese. It literally means \"the matter (of doing X) is possible\" or \"one is able to do X\".\n\nThis construction is primarily used after a verb in its plain, dictionary form. For example, 「日本語を話すことができる」 means \"I can speak Japanese\". It can also follow a noun, typically indicating a skill or a general possibility related to that noun, such as 「料理ができる」 meaning \"She can cook\" or \"Cooking is possible (here)\".\n\n**Key Usages and Nuances:**\n*   **Acquired Ability**: Often emphasizes a learned or acquired skill, like speaking a language or playing an instrument. While the potential form of a verb (e.g., 「話せる」) also expresses ability, 「することができる」 can provide a slightly more formal or explicit statement of this capability.\n*   **External Circumstances**: It is frequently used to describe what is possible or permissible due to external factors, rules, or conditions. For instance, 「ここではタバコを吸うことができない」 (You cannot smoke here) indicates a rule or restriction.\n*   **Formal Contexts**: In formal or official settings, 「することができる」 is often preferred over simple potential forms when stating rules, regulations, or what is generally possible.\n*   **Emphasis on the Act**: It can put more emphasis on the entire action or circumstance itself as being possible, rather than just the inherent capability of the subject.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「することができる」 is a versatile phrase for expressing ability or possibility, it is important to distinguish it from similar expressions. The potential forms 「～れる/られる」 often describe an **inherent capability** or a **natural potential**, whereas 「することができる」 is used for **acquired skills**, **possibilities due to external factors**, or **formal permissions and rules**. For example, 「富士山 が 見える」 (Mt. Fuji can be seen) speaks to a natural phenomenon, while 「日本 語 を 話す こと が できる」 (I can speak Japanese) highlights a learned ability.\n\nThe verb 「できる」 itself can express skill or general possibility (e.g., 「料理 が できる」 - can cook), but 「することができる」 uses the nominalizer 「こと」 to explicitly state that an entire action or circumstance is possible.\n\nFurthermore, 「得る」 (える) conveys theoretical or logical possibility, suggesting something is conceivable or could happen (e.g., 「起こり 得る こと」 - something that could happen), which is different from the practical ability expressed by 「することができる」.\n\nConversely, expressions like 「わけがない」 (there's no way) are antonyms, directly negating possibility and indicating something is logically impossible or highly improbable, which is the opposite of what 「することができる」 conveys.\n\nFinally, 「はずです」 indicates an expectation or certainty based on reason or evidence, implying something *should* be the case, rather than expressing ability or possibility.",
