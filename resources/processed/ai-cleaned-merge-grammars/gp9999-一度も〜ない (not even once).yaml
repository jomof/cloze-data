id: gp9999
meaning: Never; not even once.
meaning_warning: This phrase strongly emphasizes the complete absence of an action or event over time.
  It is not interchangeable with general negative statements that do not convey this specific nuance of
  'not even a single time.'
pronunciation:
  katakana: イチドモ〜ナイ
  romaji: ichido mo ~ nai
formation:
  一度も + Verb[negative plain form]: Emphasizes that an action has never occurred, not even a single time.
    The negative plain form can be 〜ない, 〜なかった, or part of a larger negative construction like 〜たこと が ない.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The phrase combines 「一度」(ichido), meaning 'one time' or 'once,' with the particle 「も」(mo),
  which adds an inclusive or emphatic sense, often translated as 'even' or 'also.' When 「も」 is used in
  conjunction with a negative verb form (e.g., 〜ない), it collectively means 'not even once' or 'never.'
  This construction highlights the absolute absence of an action, indicating that even the minimal occurrence
  of 'one time' has not taken place.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「一度も〜ない」 is used to emphatically state that an action or event has **never** occurred, not even a single time. It literally means "not even once." This phrase is particularly useful when you want to stress the complete absence of an experience or action. It is stronger and more specific than simply using a negative verb form, as it explicitly quantifies the non-occurrence.

  While the core construction 「一度も」 remains fixed, the verb it modifies will be in a negative form (e.g., plain negative 「〜ない」, past plain negative 「〜なかった」, or a polite negative form like 「〜ません」). The overall politeness of the sentence will depend on the final verb conjugation. For instance, 「一度も行ったことがない」 (I have never been) uses a plain negative, suitable for casual conversation, whereas 「一度も行ったことがありません」 uses a polite negative, appropriate for more formal settings.

  This expression is versatile and frequently appears in various contexts, from describing personal experiences to stating objective facts.
false_friends:
  - term: 全然〜ない
    meaning: not at all; completely (negative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「全然〜ない」 is a general intensifier for negative statements, meaning 'not at all' or 'completely
      not.' It describes the degree of non-occurrence or non-existence. In contrast, 「一度も〜ない」 specifically
      addresses the frequency, meaning 'not even once.'
    grammar_point: 全然 (not at all; totally)
  - term: めったに〜ない
    meaning: rarely; seldom
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「めったに〜ない」 implies that something happens very infrequently, but it does happen. 「一度も〜ない」,
      however, means it has literally never happened. One signifies rarity, the other absolute non-occurrence.
    grammar_point: めったに〜ない (rarely)
  - term: 決して〜ない
    meaning: never; absolutely not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「決して〜ない」 also means 'never' and is very strong, often implying a firm resolve or strong conviction.
      While both mean 'never,' 「一度も〜ない」 focuses on the lack of occurrence even a single time, making it
      more about factual absence, whereas 「決して〜ない」 can also convey an emotional or determined 'never.'
    grammar_point: 決して〜ない (emphatic never)
  - term: 全く〜ない
    meaning: not at all; utterly (negative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「全然〜ない」, 「全く〜ない」 emphasizes the complete absence or degree of something. It doesn't
      specifically count instances like 「一度も〜ない」 does.
    grammar_point: 全く〜ない (not at all)
  - term: まだ〜ていない
    meaning: hasn't done yet; still not done
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「まだ〜ていない」 suggests that an action has not been completed up to the present moment, but there
      is an expectation or possibility that it *will* be completed later. 「一度も〜ない」, on the other hand,
      states that the action has *never* occurred and implies no future expectation of it occurring.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:まだ〜ていない (still uncompleted)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between these similar expressions, remember that 「一度も〜ない」
  specifically quantifies non-occurrence by stating 'not even once.' If you're talking about the degree
  to which something is not present or done, consider 「全然〜ない」 or 「全く〜ない」. For infrequent occurrences,
  use 「めったに〜ない」. And for a strong, resolute 'never,' or a more general emphasis on absolute non-existence,
  「決して〜ない」 is often appropriate. Finally, 「まだ〜ていない」 means 'not yet,' leaving the door open for future
  action, unlike the definitive 'never' of 「一度も〜ない」.

    japanese:
      - 納豆 は {一 度 も} 食べ た こと が {ない}。
      - 納豆 は {一 度 も} 食べ た こと が {あり ませ ん}。
    english_literally: As for natto, I have not even once eaten it.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 納豆 は ぜんぜん {食べ ない}。
        english: I don't eat natto at all.
        hint: This sentence emphasizes the degree of non-eating, meaning 'I completely don't eat it.'
          We're looking for an expression that stresses the frequency, specifically 'not even once.'
      - competing_japanese:
          - 納豆 は めった に {食べ ない}。
        english: I rarely eat natto.
        hint: This means 'I seldom eat it,' implying occasional consumption. We're looking for a stronger
          statement that means 'never.'
    scene: A Japanese person is trying to convince their American friend to try natto for the first time.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of 「一度も〜ない」 emphasizes the speaker's complete lack of experience with natto. The 「〜こと
      が ない」 structure is typically used for stating lack of experience, and 「一度も」 reinforces the absolute
      nature of that lack.
  - english: He has never been abroad.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は {一 度 も} 海外 に 行っ た こと が {ない}。
      - 彼 は {一 度 も} 海外 に 行っ た こと が {あり ませ ん}。

          - 彼 は まだ 海外 に {行っ て い ない}。
        english: He hasn't gone abroad yet.
        hint: This suggests he might go abroad in the future. We're looking for a phrase that means he's
          never had the experience.
    scene: Two friends are discussing their travel experiences.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This sentence uses 「一度も」 with the past tense of a verb followed by 「こと が ない」, which is a common
      way to express a lack of past experience. It emphasizes the absolute non-occurrence of travel abroad
      for him, implying a factual absence of the experience.

    japanese:
      - 申し訳 あり ませ ん、その メール は {一 度 も} 受け取っ て {おり ませ ん}。

        english: I am sorry, I have absolutely not received that email.
        hint: While also strong, 「決して」 might sound a bit more like a personal determination not to receive
          it, or an absolute denial. We're looking for a statement about actual frequency – 'not even
          once.'
    scene: A business professional is apologizing to a client for a missing email.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of 「申し訳ありません」 and 「〜おりません」 (humble form of 「〜ています」) indicates a formal and polite
      context. 「一度も」 maintains the emphasis on 'never' while adapting to the formal tone, making it suitable
      for expressing a complete lack of receipt in a business setting.

          - 生まれ て から 雪 を めった に {見 ない}。
        english: Since being born, I rarely see snow.
        hint: This implies occasional sightings, not a complete absence. We're looking for a stronger
          statement that means 'never.'
    scene: A person from a tropical country visits a snowy region for the first time.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「生まれてから」 sets a clear starting point for the duration of 'never.' This use of 「一度も」 strongly
      conveys a lifelong absence of the experience, making it a powerful way to express a 'first-time'
      experience in life.

post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「一度も〜ない」 is a versatile expression. While often
  paired with 「〜たことがない」 to denote a lack of past experience, it can also modify other negative verb forms
  to emphasize a consistent non-occurrence across various contexts. The crucial element is the 「一度も」,
  which always highlights the 'not even a single time' aspect of the negation, making the statement very
  definitive.
