    },
    "etymology": "「それ」 refers to something previously mentioned, 「どころ」 means 'point' or 'degree,' and 「か」 is a question marker used rhetorically here to express contrast. So, literally, it means \"far from that point/degree.\"",

It indicates that the actual situation is the opposite or much more extreme than the first statement suggests. Think of it as saying \"far from that being true, the opposite is true\" or \"not only that, but even more so.\"",
