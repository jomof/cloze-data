        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "casual",
        "function": "To introduce a statement that contrasts sharply with a prior statement, indicating a greater degree or an opposite situation.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes a strong contradiction or a significant escalation of a situation, often with a rhetorical 'か' (question marker) implying 'how could you even think that?' or 'it's so far from that point'."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「それどころか」 combines 「それ」 (that) referring to the preceding statement, 「どころ」 (a place or degree/point), and the rhetorical particle 「か」 (question marker). Literally, it can be interpreted as \"how could it even be that point/degree?\" or \"far from that point.\" This etymology highlights its function of strongly refuting or escalating a previous idea.",
    "writeup": "「それどころか」 is a powerful conjunction used to introduce a statement that presents a strong contrast or escalation to what was previously said or implied. It conveys that the actual situation is not just different, but often the complete opposite or significantly more extreme than the initial statement suggests. It can be used when the reality is either much better or much worse than anticipated.There are generally two main patterns of usage:1.  **Connecting two sentences:** When used between two full sentences, the first sentence typically presents a mild statement or a negation, and the second sentence, introduced by 「それどころか」, provides a stark contradiction or an amplified reality. This emphasizes how far the truth deviates from the initial premise.2.  **As a strong response:** 「それどころか」 is frequently used as a direct response to a question or statement, often followed by 「ではない」 or 「じゃない」, meaning \"no way\" or \"far from it.\" This form forcefully rejects an idea or suggestion by pointing to a more critical or contrasting reality.「それどころか」 carries a strong rhetorical force, similar to saying, \"how could you even think that?\" or \"it's not just X, it's Y!\" It's less about merely adding information and more about correcting a perceived misunderstanding or dramatically shifting the context of a situation. While suitable for both casual and semi-formal contexts, its emphatic nature can sometimes feel strong in very formal or polite settings.",

            "meaning": "Not limited to; not just; far from it (but less emphatic)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「それどころか」 indicates a strong contradiction or a dramatic escalation, 「どころか」 by itself can also imply a contrast, but often focuses on stating a situation that is the opposite of an expectation, sometimes with a nuance of surprise or disappointment. It can also mean 'not only X, but also Y'. The presence of 「それ」 in 「それどころか」 makes the contradiction more direct and emphatic, referencing a specific preceding statement."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The core distinction lies in the emphasis and the nature of the contradiction. 「それどころか」 is used for a sharper, more direct refutation or a dramatic escalation from a specific prior statement. It often implies a greater degree of 'no way' or 'on the contrary'. 「どころか」 (without 「それ」) can also express contradiction, but it can sometimes simply add to the information, implying 'not just X, but even Y,' or 'instead of X, it's Y.' Consider whether you are strongly challenging or escalating a *specific* previous idea (use 「それどころか」) versus merely contrasting or adding to a general expectation or fact (where 「どころか」 might suffice).",
