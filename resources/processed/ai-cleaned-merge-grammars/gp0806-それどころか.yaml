    "writeup": "**それどころか (soredokoroka)** is a conjunction used to indicate that the reality is not just different from what was suggested, but often the complete opposite or something much more extreme. It conveys a sense of \"far from it\" or \"on the contrary.\" It's often used to correct a misunderstanding or emphasize a point. Think of it as a stronger way of saying \"not at all\" or \"quite the opposite.\"",
    "etymology": "「それ」 refers to the preceding statement or situation. 「どころ」 means 'state' or 'condition.' 「か」 is a question particle, but in this context, it creates a rhetorical question implying the opposite of the initial statement. The combination suggests that the actual state is far removed from what was previously mentioned.",
