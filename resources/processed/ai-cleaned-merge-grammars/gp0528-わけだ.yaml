    "writeup": "The grammar point 「わけだ (wake da)」 is used to express a reason, explanation, or conclusion based on something that has been observed or stated. It conveys a sense of \"for that reason,\" \"no wonder,\" or \"as you'd expect.\"\n\n*   It's often used when the speaker has come to a realization or understanding based on new information.\n*   It can also be used to emphasize a logical consequence or a natural outcome.\n\nThis grammar point can be thought of as similar to saying \"so that's why\" in English. It can also be used in questions 「わけですか (wake desu ka)」 or 「わけだね (wake da ne)」 to seek confirmation or understanding.",
