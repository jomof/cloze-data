    "etymology": "The term 「わけ (wake)」 originates from the concept of \"reason\" or \"meaning.\" Historically, it points to the underlying logic or cause of a situation. When combined with the copula 「だ (da)」, which asserts affirmation, 「わけだ」 forms a conclusive statement. This linguistic evolution reflects its primary function: to explain a natural consequence or logical conclusion derived from preceding information.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「わけだ (wake da)」 is a foundational expression used to convey a logical conclusion, a natural outcome, or a deep understanding based on known facts or circumstances. It is formed by combining the noun 「訳 (wake)」, meaning \"reason\" or \"conclusion,\" with the auxiliary verb 「だ (da)」 (or its polite form 「です (desu)」). This construction is typically placed at the end of a sentence.\n\nAt its core, 「わけだ」 indicates that \"it is so that (A)\" or \"so it is (A),\" signifying that the preceding statement provides the reason or explanation for a given situation. It often carries nuances such as \"for that reason,\" \"no wonder,\" or \"as you'd expect,\" highlighting the speaker's realization or the inherent logical flow of events.\n\nDue to 「わけ」 functioning as a noun, the word preceding it must be in its attributive form (連体形, rentai-kei). This means:\n*   Verbs and い-adjectives directly precede it in their plain forms.\n*   な-adjectives require 「な」 before 「わけだ」.\n*   Nouns typically use 「だ」 or the more formal 「である」.\n\n「わけだ」 is versatile and can also be used in questions, such as 「わけですか (wake desu ka)」 or 「わけだね (wake da ne)」, when the speaker seeks confirmation or clarification of a situation they are trying to understand. This usage implies that the speaker is processing information and attempting to deduce the underlying reason or meaning.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When differentiating between these expressions, consider the core meaning of 「わけだ」: presenting a logical conclusion, a natural consequence, or a realization based on known facts. Other expressions might imply expectation, purpose, or general advice. For instance, while 「はずだ」 suggests an `expectation` or `certainty`, 「わけだ」 states a fact or conclusion that *follows* from existing information. Similarly, 「ため(に)」 indicates a direct `purpose` or `cause`, whereas 「わけだ」 highlights the inherent reason for a state of affairs. Focus on whether the statement is explaining *why* something is the way it is as a natural outcome, rather than simply stating a purpose, an expectation, or an obligation.",
