    "etymology": "「訳 (wake)」 means \"reason\" or \"meaning.\" The 「だ (da)」 is the plain form of the copula 「です (desu)」, indicating assertion or affirmation.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「わけだ (wake da)」 is formed by combining the noun 「訳 (wake)」, which signifies \"reason,\" \"meaning,\" or \"conclusion,\" with the copula 「だ (da).\" It is used to present a logical reason, a natural outcome, or a conclusion derived from existing circumstances or information. This expression often conveys a sense of \"for that reason,\" \"no wonder,\" or \"as you'd expect.\"\n\nIt is frequently employed when the speaker has just arrived at a realization or a clear understanding based on newly acquired knowledge or observed facts. In essence, it functions to assert that \"it is so that (A)\" or \"so it is (A).\" Because 「わけ」 is a noun, any word preceding it must be in its attributive form (連体形, rentai-kei). This means verbs and い-adjectives directly precede it in their plain forms, while な-adjectives require 「な」 before 「わけだ」, and nouns typically use 「だ」 or the more formal 「である」.\n\n「わけだ」 can also be used in questions, such as 「わけですか (wake desu ka)」 or 「わけだね (wake da ne)」, to seek confirmation or to express a desire for clarification of a situation.",

Other expressions might imply expectation, purpose, or general advice. For instance, while 「はずだ」 suggests an `expectation` or `certainty`, 「わけだ」 states a fact or conclusion that *follows* from existing information. Similarly, 「ため(に)」 indicates a direct `purpose` or `cause`, whereas 「わけだ」 highlights the inherent reason for a state of affairs. Focus on whether the statement is explaining *why* something is the way it is as a natural outcome, rather than simply stating a purpose, an expectation, or an obligation.",
