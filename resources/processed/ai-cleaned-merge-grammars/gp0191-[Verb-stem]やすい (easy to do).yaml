formation:
  Verb [masu-stem] + やすい (Ease): Indicates that an action is easy to perform, often due to the inherent
    nature or design of the subject or object.
  Verb [masu-stem] + やすい (Tendency): Indicates a tendency or predisposition towards an action, often implying
    susceptibility or likelihood.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  function: Indicates the inherent ease with which an action can be performed or experienced, or expresses
    a tendency, likelihood, or susceptibility to an action or state.
  nuance: For the 'easy to do' sense, it focuses on the inherent characteristic of an object or situation
    that makes an action effortless or straightforward, often describing something designed to facilitate
    the action. For the 'prone to' sense, it describes an inherent predisposition or recurring pattern,
    often (but not always) implying a slight negative connotation or an undesirable outcome.
  counterpoint: にくい (difficult to do)
  colocation: Often used with transitive verbs, describing the ease of manipulating or interacting with
    an object. It can also be used with intransitive verbs, describing the ease of a state or process.
    When describing tendencies, it's used to comment on inherent characteristics or recurring patterns.
  grammatical-role: Functions as an い-adjective, meaning it can modify nouns or act as a predicate at
    the end of a sentence. It forms a compound adjective, modifying a verb's action to describe its inherent
    ease of happening or tendency.
  temporal-flow: For tendencies, it describes an ongoing or habitual tendency rather than a single event.
etymology: The suffix 「やすい」 originates from the い-adjective 「易い」 (yasui), meaning "easy to do," "simple,"
  or "uncomplicated." Over time, its usage extended to describe not just the ease of an action, but also
  an inherent tendency or a predisposition for something to occur, often with a nuance of susceptibility.
  This evolution reflects how something "easy to do" can also imply something that is "likely to happen"
  or "prone to." The same form is used for both meanings, which can sometimes be a source of confusion
  for learners.
writeup: |-
  The grammatical suffix 「〜やすい」 attaches to the masu-stem of verbs and functions like a regular い-adjective, conjugating in the same way. This form is versatile and has two primary, yet distinct, meanings: **"easy to do"** and **"prone to" or "likely to."**

  When 「〜やすい」 expresses **"easy to do,"** it describes an inherent quality of an object or situation that makes a particular action straightforward or effortless. For instance, if a book is 「読みやすい」 (yomi-yasui), it means the book itself is easy to read, perhaps due to large print, clear content, or an engaging style. This usage often implies good design, quality, or a user-friendly aspect, rather than the skill of the person performing the action.

  Conversely, when 「〜やすい」 means **"prone to" or "likely to,"** it indicates a tendency, predisposition, or susceptibility for an action to occur. This often describes inherent characteristics or recurring patterns, and while it can be neutral, it frequently carries a slight negative connotation or suggests an undesirable outcome. For example, if someone is 「怒りやすい」 (okori-yasui), it means they are "prone to getting angry" or "easily angered," describing a character trait. Similarly, an object that is 「壊れやすい」 (koware-yasui) is "prone to breaking" or "fragile."

  Context is paramount for distinguishing these two meanings. While the grammatical structure is identical, the nature of the verb and the subject typically clarify which nuance is intended. Understanding this dual nature is essential for both comprehension and accurate usage.
false_friends:
  - term: がち
    meaning: Apt to do, Tend to do, Prone to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 「やすい」 (in its 'prone to' sense) and 「がち」 express a tendency. However, 「がち」 carries a
      stronger and almost exclusive nuance of a negative, undesirable, or frequent habit. 「やすい」 (prone
      to) is broader and can be neutral or positive, though it often suggests a less controlled or spontaneous
      occurrence.
    grammar_point: がち (tend to)
  - term: きらいがある
    meaning: Have a tendency to, Tend to, Be slightly~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「やすい」 (in its 'prone to' sense), which can be neutral or negative, 「きらいがある」 is almost
      exclusively used for undesirable or problematic tendencies, implying a fault or defect in character
      or behavior.
    grammar_point: きらいがある (undesirable tendency)
  - term: にくい
    meaning: Difficult to, Hard to
    kind: antonym
    nuance: This is the direct opposite of the 'easy to do' sense of 「やすい」, indicating difficulty in performing
      an action. While 「やすい」 (prone to) describes likelihood, 「にくい」 implies resistance or difficulty.
    grammar_point: にくい (difficult to do)
  - term: 簡単だ
    meaning: simple; easy (in general)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「簡単だ」 describes something as **simple** or **uncomplicated** in its nature or structure, often
      referring to a task or problem. While a simple task might also be easy to do, 「やすい」 specifically
      describes the **ease of performing an action** related to it, often highlighting a user-friendly
      aspect or design.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:簡単だ (simple)
  - term: Vすることができる
    meaning: can do; be able to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Vすることができる」 expresses **ability** or **possibility** (i.e., one is capable of doing something,
      or it is possible to do it). In contrast, 「やすい」 emphasizes the **effortlessness** or low difficulty
      involved in performing the action, assuming the ability is already present.
    grammar_point: することができる (can・be able to)
  - term: 得意だ
    meaning: to be good at; to be skillful
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「得意だ」 describes **one's own skill** or proficiency in performing an action, making it easy
      for *that particular person*. 「やすい」 describes the **inherent ease of the action or object itself**,
      irrespective of the performer's individual skill level.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:得意だ (to be good at)
  - term: 楽だ
    meaning: easy; comfortable; relaxed
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「楽だ」 means something is **easy** in the sense of being **comfortable, not burdensome, or requiring
      little effort**, often implying a pleasant experience or relief from hardship. While overlapping,
      「やすい」 more directly focuses on the ease of *doing* an action, particularly regarding design or usability.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:楽だ (easy・comfortable)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「〜やすい」 from other similar expressions, consider whether
  the focus is on the inherent quality of the item or action (「やすい」), the simplicity of the task itself
  (「簡単だ」), the capability to perform the action (「Vすることができる」), or a person's skill level (「得意だ」). For
  tendencies, 「がち」 typically implies an undesirable habit or frequent negative occurrence, while 「きらいがある」
  is reserved for specific, usually negative, personal or behavioral faults. The key is that 「やすい」 points
  to what makes the action easy, or a natural inclination or susceptibility.

      for anyone to operate, not just someone skilled with technology. The casual tone is indicated by
      the omission of the politeness marker 'です' at the end. 「スマホ」 is a casual abbreviation for smartphone.

          of the screen, which doesn't make sense for an object).
        hint: 「つきがち」 would imply a habit or frequent negative occurrence of the screen itself, which is
          grammatically awkward for an inanimate object. 「つきやすい」 is better for describing material properties.
    scene: Someone is complaining about their new smartphone.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang

        english: It's not that this type of plant is hard to get diseased (i.e., it is prone to disease).

          disease, which contradicts the English sentence.
    scene: A gardening expert is giving advice.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)

      phrasing for a general recommendation.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the precise nuance of 「〜やすい」 is crucial. While it can describe the
  ease of an action, its use for "prone to" or "likely to" often highlights an inherent characteristic,
  susceptibility, or tendency. This is particularly evident when describing physical properties of objects
  or inherent traits of people, which may not always carry a negative connotation but imply a natural
  inclination. When considering negative habits or frequent undesirable occurrences, 「がち」 or 「きらいがある」
  might be more appropriate, but 「〜やすい」 provides a broader and often more neutral description of a predisposition.
  When choosing between 「やすい」 and words like 「簡単」 or 「楽」, consider if you are describing the inherent
  quality that *makes* an action easy, or simply that something is easy or comfortable in a more general
  sense.
