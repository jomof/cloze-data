formation:
  '[Noun を] + 生かす': Used when describing the act of making the best use of a noun, or keeping something
    alive.
jlpt: N2
etymology: The verb 「生かす」(いかす) stems from the kanji 「生」 (ikiru, 'to live'; umareru, 'to be born'), which
  fundamentally conveys concepts of life, birth, and raw existence. The suffix -かす functions as a transitive
  marker, indicating causation. Thus, 「生かす」literally means 'to cause something to live' or 'to bring something
  to life.' Over time, its meaning expanded to encompass 'making good use of' or 'leveraging,' as one
  'brings life' or 'activates the potential' of an object, skill, or experience. This dual meaning of
  preserving life and maximizing utility is inherent in its etymological roots.
writeup: |-
  The Japanese verb 「生かす」(いかす) is a transitive verb that holds two primary, yet interconnected, meanings: "to keep alive" or "to let live," and "to make good use of," "to leverage," or "to utilize." Both meanings are rooted in the kanji 「生」(い), which signifies 'life,' 'birth,' or 'to live.'

  When 「生かす」is used in the sense of **"to keep alive" or "to let live,"** it often refers to preserving actual life, such as a living creature or a human being. For example, a doctor might 「命を生かす」(inochi o ikasu) – 'save a life,' or a chef might 「魚を生かす」(sakana o ikasu) – 'keep the fish alive' until cooking.

  More broadly, 「生かす」is frequently used to mean **"to make good use of" or "to leverage."** In this context, it implies extracting the maximum potential, benefit, or value from something. This can apply to skills, experiences, resources, opportunities, or even a person's individual characteristics. For instance, 「経験を生かす」(keiken o ikasu) means 'to make good use of one's experience,' and 「才能を生かす」(sainō o ikasu) means 'to leverage one's talent.' This usage emphasizes effectively activating or bringing to fruition the inherent qualities or capabilities of something.

  Understanding both aspects of 「生かす」is crucial. While seemingly disparate, they both revolve around the concept of allowing something to fulfill its purpose or potential, whether that purpose is continued existence or effective utility. The context will usually make it clear which meaning is intended.

  - term: 活かす (to make good use of)
    meaning: to make good use of, to revitalize, to bring to life
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 'While 「生かす」and 「活かす」are often used interchangeably for ''to make good use of,'' 「活かす」 (活:
      lively, active) carries a stronger emphasis on ''making something active'' or ''revitalizing it.''
      「生かす」 (生: life, birth) retains a clearer connection to ''preserving life'' or ''giving life'' in
      a broader sense.'
    grammar_point: 活かす (to make good use of)
  - term: 利用する (to use, utilize)
    meaning: to use, to utilize, to make use of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「利用する」is a more general verb for 'to use' or 'to utilize,' often for practical purposes. It
      does not carry the same nuance of 'maximizing potential' or 'preserving life' that 「生かす」does. For
      example, you can 利用する a tool, but you 「生かす」a skill.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:利用する (to use・utilize)
  - term: 活用する (to make practical use of)
    meaning: to make practical use of, to apply effectively
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「活用する」is very close in meaning to the 'make good use of' sense of 「生かす」, particularly when
      referring to applying knowledge, resources, or systems effectively. It focuses on practical application.
      「生かす」can be more about bringing out inherent potential, whereas 「活用する」is about putting something
      to work.
    grammar_point: 活用する (to make practical use of)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To differentiate between these similar terms: 「生かす」implies preserving life
  or drawing out the inherent potential and value of something. 「活かす」is often interchangeable with 「生かす」for
  ''making good use of,'' but can lean towards ''revitalizing.'' 「利用する」is a general term for ''to use''
  without the specific nuance of maximization or preservation. 「活用する」is about effectively applying existing
  things.'

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 自分 の 本当 の 気持ち を 隠し た。
        english: She hid her true feelings.
        hint: 「隠す」means to conceal or hide. 「生かさなかった」implies she 'did not let her feelings come to life'
          or 'did not make use of them' (i.e., express them). We're looking for the nuance of *not letting
          out* something, rather than just concealing.

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「生かさなかった」here implies she deliberately 'did not let her true feelings come out
      or be known,' metaphorically 'not letting them live.' It suggests an active suppression or decision
      not to express. This expression isn't inherently gendered, but this sentence setup fits a casual
      conversation between female friends.

    scene: A teacher advising students on time management.
    register: semi-formal

    speaker_age: older

      an authoritative figure) suggests advice on optimizing time. This phrasing is common from an older,
      male teacher or mentor, who would use this supportive yet guiding tone.

        english: I want to make good use of my experience working abroad in my next job.
        hint: While 「活かす」is often interchangeable, 「生かす」can carry a slightly stronger nuance of giving

  contexts, such as preserving life, but it truly shines in its metaphorical application of maximizing
  potential and value. Pay attention to the object of the verb to discern whether it refers to physical
  preservation or effective utilization.
