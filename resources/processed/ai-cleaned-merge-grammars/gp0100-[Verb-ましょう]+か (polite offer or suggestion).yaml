meaning: Shall I/we...? (polite offer or suggestion)
pronunciation:
  katakana: 〜ましょうか
  romaji: ~mashou ka
formation:
  Verb[ます-stem] + ましょうか: Used to politely offer to do something or to make a suggestion.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: Making polite offers, inviting, or suggesting actions.
  nuance: Seeks agreement or input from the listener, less assertive than plain volitional.
  grammatical-role: functions as a sentence-final expression to ask for permission or suggest an action.
etymology: The 〜ましょう ending is the polite volitional form, evolving from the classical volitional む (which
  became う). The ます part provides politeness. Adding か turns it into a question, transforming a volitional
  statement (let's do X) into a polite offer or suggestion (shall we do X?).
writeup: 〜ましょうか is a polite and common way to offer help, suggest an activity, or ask for permission to
  do something. It combines the polite volitional ending 〜ましょう with the question particle か. The core
  meaning shifts from a simple "let's do X" (volitional) to "shall I/we do X?" or "may I/we do X?". This
  form is widely used in daily conversations, particularly when interacting with people who are not close
  friends or family, or when showing deference. It implies a degree of politeness and consideration for
  the listener's opinion or willingness. While 〜ましょう alone can be a suggestion ("Let's go."), adding か
  makes it an inquiry, softening the directness and inviting a response or confirmation. It's often used
  when the speaker is proposing an action for themselves or for themselves and the listener.

  - term: ましょう (polite volitional or suggestion)
    meaning: Let's do...; I intend to do...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜ましょうか is an offer or suggestion seeking input, while 〜ましょう is a direct suggestion or statement
      of intent. 〜ましょう is more assertive.
    grammar_point: ましょう (polite volitional or suggestion)
  - term: ませんか (invitation or suggestion)
    meaning: Won't you...?; Shall we...?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜ましょうか is primarily an offer from the speaker (or speaker + listener). 〜ませんか is often more
      directly an invitation for the listener to join or do something. While both can be translated as
      "Shall we?", 〜ましょうか emphasizes the speaker's willingness to perform or initiate the action, whereas
      〜ませんか often implies a gentle push for the listener's participation.
    grammar_point: ませんか (invitation or suggestion)
  - term: Verb[て]+もいい (permission)
    meaning: Is it okay to...?; May I...?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜ましょうか is an offer to do something or a suggestion. 〜てもいい explicitly asks for permission.
      For example, "手伝いましょうか" (Shall I help?) vs. "手伝ってもいいですか" (Is it okay if I help?). The former offers,
      the latter seeks approval.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て]+もいい (permission)
  - term: Verb[ます] + か
    meaning: Polite question about an action
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜ましょうか suggests or offers an action. Verb[ます] + か merely asks a factual question about an
      action without necessarily offering to perform it. For example, "行きますか" (Are you going?) vs. "行きましょうか"
      (Shall we go?).
    grammar_point: か (question)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 〜ましょうか, 〜ませんか, and 〜ましょう, consider the nuance of your
  intention. 〜ましょうか is best for offering your help or gently suggesting a joint action where you are initiating.
  〜ませんか is more direct as an invitation for the listener to participate. 〜ましょう without か is a stronger,
  more definite suggestion or statement of intent for "let's do X" or "I will do X." For example, if you
  see someone struggling with bags, "持ちましょうか" (Shall I carry them for you?) is a direct offer. If you
  want to invite someone to dinner, "一緒に夕食を食べませんか" (Won't you eat dinner with me?) is more suitable. If
  you decide to go somewhere, "行きましょう" (Let's go!) is a clear statement.
