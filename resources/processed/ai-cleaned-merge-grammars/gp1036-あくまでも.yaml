    "etymology": "The term derives from 飽く (aku), an older form of 飽きる (akiru), meaning \"to tire of\" or \"to get sick of,\" combined with まで (made, \"until\") and も (mo, \"even\"). The phrase literally suggests continuing something even to the point of exhaustion or dissatisfaction.",
    "writeup": "**Akumademo** is an adverb that conveys the idea of doing something \"to the bitter end,\" \"stubbornly,\" or \"persistently.\" It implies a strong intention to continue a course of action regardless of the consequences or difficulties. The nuance is that someone is determined to pursue something to the utmost degree, even to the point where one might normally give up. It's derived from 飽く (aku), the old-fashioned version of 飽きる (to tire of), combined with まで (until) and も (even). While **akumade** without the **mo** is possible, the phrase is stronger and more emphatic when **mo** is included.",
