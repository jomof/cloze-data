    "etymology": "The term 「あくまでも」 comes from 「飽く」 (aku), an older form of 「飽きる」 (akiru), meaning \"to tire of\" or \"to be satisfied.\" Adding 「まで」 (made) \"until\" and 「も」 (mo) \"even\" emphasizes continuing an action even to the point of being tired of it.",
    "writeup": "「あくまでも」 is an adverb that conveys the idea of doing something **persistently**, **stubbornly**, or **to the bitter end**. It emphasizes continuing an action or holding onto an opinion regardless of the circumstances. The literal sense of continuing until one is \"tired of it\" is implied, highlighting the strong determination behind the action. While 「あくまで」 without 「も」 can occur, 「あくまでも」 is far more common due to its added emphasis. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence, setting the tone for the unwavering action or stance being described.",
