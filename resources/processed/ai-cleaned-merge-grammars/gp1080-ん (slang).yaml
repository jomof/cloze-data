jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to shorten negative verb endings and the progressive form ~ている in very casual, informal
    speech. Often heard among friends and family, or when speaking to oneself.
  function: To make speech flow more smoothly and quickly by reducing syllable count. Imparts a sense
    of familiarity or roughness.
  nuance: Carries a strong sense of informality and sometimes a regional or masculine tone, depending
    on context and specific abbreviation. It suggests a relaxed or sometimes even dismissive attitude.
    Forms like `~んない` are widely used by younger generations and female speakers, while `~ん` forms can
    be more masculine or older sounding in some regions.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a colloquial alternative to the full negative or progressive auxiliary
    forms.
etymology: 「ん」 as a slang abbreviation derives from the natural sound changes that occur in rapid, informal
  speech. This type of reduction (elision or truncation) is a common linguistic phenomenon across languages,
  where syllables are dropped for ease of pronunciation and flow. Specifically, the 'n' sound represents
  the nasalized vowel sound that often results from the removal of the 'r' sound in the 'ra' row (e.g.,
  in -ない or -ている when pronounced casually), making it easier and quicker to articulate.
writeup: |-
  The grammatical point 「ん」 serves as a slang abbreviation for both the plain negative form (~ない) and the progressive/state-of-being form (~ている). It is exclusively used in highly casual and informal contexts, primarily among close friends, family, or in situations where extreme familiarity is established.

  This abbreviation often occurs when the original form includes a 'ら' (ra), 'り' (ri), 'る' (ru), 'れ' (re), or 'ろ' (ro) sound in the syllable being omitted or altered. For instance, 「分からない」 (wakaranai) might become 「分かんない」 (wakannai) or even 「分からん」 (wakaran), where the 'ra' sound is reduced.

  **Forms of Abbreviation:**
  *   **Negative Form (~ない)**: Many verbs ending in 「~る」 in their dictionary form, when conjugated to the negative plain form (~らない), can be abbreviated. For example, 「知らない」 (shiranai) shortens to 「知らん」 (shiran). Similarly, verbs whose negative form ends in 「~ない」 can be abbreviated by dropping the 'ra' sound and replacing it with 'n', such as 「食べない」 (tabenai) not becoming 「食べん」 but rather 「食べんない」 (tabennai) if one wants to keep the 'nai' part of the negative, or 「分かんない」 (wakannai) from 「分からない」 (wakaranai). Note that the irregular verb 「する」 (suru) has a special negative abbreviation: 「しない」 (shinai) becomes 「せん」 (sen).

  *   **Progressive Form (~ている)**: The entire 「いる」 (iru) part of the progressive 「~ている」 (te-iru) form can be reduced to 「ん」, 「とん」 (ton), or 「どん」 (don) depending on the preceding sound. For example, 「している」 (shiteiru) often becomes 「してん」 (shiten) or 「しとん」 (shiton), and 「食べている」 (tabeteiru) becomes 「食べとん」 (tabeton).

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   **Sentence-Ending Nuance**: While this specific slang abbreviation 「ん」 often precedes another word or particle, particularly in the `~んない` forms, some `~ん` forms (e.g., `知らん`, `分からん`) can stand alone at the end of a sentence in very casual speech, especially in certain dialects. If you encounter a sentence ending in 「ん」, it is usually either this casual abbreviation, the classical auxiliary verb 「ぬ」 (nu) which has a forceful negative nuance, or a sentence-final particle 「ん」 used for explanation or seeking confirmation (often a colloquial contraction of 「のです」).
  *   **Gender and Age Nuances**: While used by speakers of all genders, certain forms like 「~ん」 (e.g., 「知らん」) can carry a slightly more masculine or older tone in some regions, or among certain social groups. Conversely, 「~んない」 forms (e.g., 「分かんない」) are widely used by younger generations, especially among female speakers, making them sound less rough than the pure 「~ん」 forms. The 「~とん」 / 「~どん」 forms are often associated with Kansai dialect, but their usage has spread and is understood across Japan in casual speech.
false_friends:
  - term: ない
    meaning: Plain negative form (auxiliary adjective)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「ん」 is an abbreviation of 「ない」, 「ない」 is the standard, grammatically complete form. 「ん」
      is specifically a colloquial reduction used for speed and informality, whereas 「ない」 is neutral in
      formality (when used in plain form).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Negative form (plain)
  - term: ている
    meaning: Progressive or state-of-being form (auxiliary verb)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Similar to 「ない」, 「ている」 is the standard, complete form. 「ん」 (or 「とん」/「どん」) is its casual, abbreviated
      counterpart, used to convey informality and efficiency in speech.
    grammar_point: ている (~ing)
  - term: ぬ
    meaning: Classical negative auxiliary verb (similar to modern ない)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ぬ」 (which also ends with 'ん' in some conjugations, like 「行かぬ」 → 「行かん」) is an archaic negative
      form. While its ending can resemble the modern slang 「ん」, it carries a more forceful, emphatic,
      or literary nuance, unlike the purely casual and facilitative nature of the slang 「ん」. It is not
      an abbreviation for ease of speech but a distinct, older grammatical form.
    grammar_point: ぬ (classical negative auxiliary)
  - term: ん (sentence-final particle)
    meaning: Sentence-final particle for explanation, confirmation, or gentle assertion (contraction of
      のです)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This 「ん」 appears at the very end of a sentence and serves a distinct pragmatic function of
      providing explanation or seeking confirmation. The slang abbreviation 「ん」 discussed here almost
      always precedes another word or particle and functions solely as a grammatical abbreviation within
      a phrase, not a sentence-final particle.
    grammar_point: の (explanatory softening particle)
  - term: んです
    meaning: Grammatical pattern used for explanation, emphasis, or seeking information
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「んです」 uses 「ん」 (a contraction of 「の」) to add an explanatory or emphatic nuance to a statement.
      While it contains the sound 'ん', its grammatical role is distinct; it's a structural element for
      providing context or emphasis, whereas the slang 「ん」 is a direct abbreviation of verb conjugations
      for casualness.
    grammar_point: んです・のです (explanatory emphatic)
post_false_friends_writeup: When encountering 「ん」, it's crucial to consider its position in the sentence
  and the overall context. If it's part of a verb phrase (e.g., 「知らない」 becoming 「知らん」), it's likely the
  abbreviation discussed here. If it's at the very end of a sentence (e.g., 「そうなん？」), it's probably the
  explanatory particle derived from 「のです」. The archaic 「ぬ」 form, while also ending in 「ん」, tends to appear
  in more formal or traditional speech and carries a different, often stronger negative nuance, indicating
  it's not simply a casual shortcut.
examples:
  - english: No one knows such a thing.
    japanese:
      - そんな こと は 誰 も わから {ん}。
      - そんな こと は 誰 も 分から {ん}。
    english_literally: Such thing is no one know-not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな こと は 誰 も わから ない。
          - そんな こと は 誰 も 分から ない。
        english: No one knows such a thing (standard).
        hint: The casual abbreviation 「ん」 is used here. We're looking for the very informal version.
    scene: Two friends are trying to solve a perplexing puzzle, but they've hit a dead end.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: The use of `わからん` is a highly casual abbreviation of `わからない`. It conveys a sense of directness
      and informality common among close friends, fitting the serious yet informal setting.
    etymology: 「わからん」 derives from the verb 「分かる」 (wakaru, to understand) in its negative form 「分からない」
      (wakaranai), with the 'ra' sound reduced to 'n' for rapid, colloquial speech. The full form `分からない`
      is the standard way to express this meaning, while `わからん` specifically marks it as very informal
      or even gruff speech, depending on context and speaker.
  - english: I don't think he knows that secret.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は その 秘密 を 知 {ん ない} と 思う よ。
      - 彼 は その 秘密 を 知 {ん ない} と 思う よ。
    english_literally: He that secret know-not-think I guess.

          - 彼 は その 秘密 を 知ら ない と 思う よ。
        english: I don't think he knows that secret (standard).
        hint: The 「んない」 form is a highly casual abbreviation. We're looking for the abbreviated form of
          'shiranai'.
    scene: Two female high school students are gossiping about a male classmate.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of `知んない` is a common abbreviation for `知らない` in casual speech, particularly among
      younger generations and female speakers, fitting the high school gossip scenario. The ending `よ`
      adds a gentle assertion to the speaker's opinion.
    etymology: 「知んない」 is a colloquial abbreviation of 「知らない」 (shiranai, don't know). The 'ra' sound is
      elided, and the 'n' sound takes its place, followed by the 'nai' negative ending, creating a softer,
      more intimate negative form than simply `知らん`.
  - english: Mom, I'm still studying.
    japanese:
      - お 母 さん、まだ 勉強 し {てん} だ。
      - お 母 さん、まだ 勉強 し {てん} だ よ。
      - お 母 さん、まだ 勉強 し {てん} の。
    english_literally: Mom, still studying-am.

      - competing_japanese:
          - お 母 さん、まだ 勉強 し て いる ん だ。
        english: Mom, I'm still studying (standard).
        hint: The 「てん」 form is a common casual abbreviation of 「ている」. We're looking for the abbreviated
          progressive form.
    scene: A child reluctantly informs their mother that they are still studying, perhaps having been
      asked to finish up.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The abbreviation `勉強してん` (from `勉強している`) is typical of casual, colloquial speech, often used
      by younger speakers towards family members. The `だ` at the end makes it a casual statement, while
      `だよ` adds a mild emphasis, and `の` gives a softer, sometimes slightly questioning tone, all appropriate
      for a child's interaction with a parent.
    etymology: 「してん」 is a contraction of 「している」 (shiteiru, is doing/studying), where the `iru` part is
      reduced to `n`. This reduction often involves a glottal stop or a slight pause before the nasal
      `n`, smoothing the transition in rapid speech.
  - english: That person is always in a hurry, so it's better not to talk to them.
    japanese:
      - あの 人 は いつ も 急い {どる} から、話 し かけ {ん} ほう が いい よ。
      - あの 人 は いつ も 急い {どる} から、話しかけ {ん} 方 が いい よ。
      - あの 人 は いつ も 急い {とる} から、話しかけ {ん} 方 が いい よ。

        english: That person is always in a hurry, so it's better not to talk to them (standard).
        hint: Both 「急いどる」 and 「話しかけん」 are casual, sometimes dialectal, abbreviations. We're looking for
          these shortened forms.
    scene: An older man advises a younger man about a colleague who is always busy.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The abbreviation `急いどる` (from `急いでいる`) is a highly colloquial, often dialectal (Kansai-ben),
      form of the progressive, commonly heard in informal male speech, especially among older men. Similarly,
      `話しかけん` (from `話しかけない`) is a direct, informal negative abbreviation. The combination of these forms
      imparts a natural, seasoned tone typical of advice shared between men who are comfortable with each
      other.
    etymology: 「急いどる」 is a regional abbreviation of 「急いでいる」 (isoide iru, is hurrying), often found in
      Kansai dialect, where `~ている` becomes `~とる` or `~どる`. 「話しかけん」 is a direct abbreviation of 「話しかけない」
      (hanashikakenai, don't talk to), shortening the negative ending for casualness.
  - english: This movie was totally boring.
    japanese:
      - この 映画 は 全然 つま {らん} かっ た。

        hint: 「つまらん」 is a highly casual abbreviation of 「つまらない」. We're looking for the abbreviated form.
    scene: A group of university students are complaining about a recent film they watched together.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The use of `つまらん` as an abbreviation of `つまらない` is a very common and highly casual way to
      express something is boring. Adding `かった` forms the past tense of this colloquial adjective. This
      fits the informal setting of friends complaining about a movie.
    etymology: 「つまらん」 is a contraction of the i-adjective 「つまらない」 (tsumaranai, boring, dull), where the
      `~ない` ending is shortened to `~ん`. This specific contraction is widely used as a casual expression
      for boredom or lack of interest.
  - english: Are you still preparing the documents for tomorrow's meeting?
    japanese:
      - 明日 の 会議 の 資料、まだ 準備 し {てん} の？

        english: Are you still preparing the documents for tomorrow's meeting (standard)?
        hint: 「してん」 is a casual contraction of 「している」. We're looking for the contracted form of the progressive
          tense.
    scene: A colleague asks another colleague about a deadline for a meeting.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    nuance: The abbreviation `準備してん` (from `準備している`) is a common way to shorten the progressive form in
      casual to semi-formal workplace interactions, especially when colleagues are comfortable with each
      other. The `の` at the end makes the question softer and more inquisitive, maintaining a professional
      yet approachable tone. `準備しとん` is a dialectal variation, common in Kansai, that also conveys the
      same casualness.
    etymology: 「してん」 (shiten) is a contraction of 「している」 (shiteiru), where the `iru` part is reduced to
      `n`. 「しとん」 (shiton) is a common regional variant, particularly in Kansai, where `~ている` becomes `~とる`/`~とん`.
  - english: I don't buy things I don't really need.

          form.
    scene: A frugal person explaining their spending habits to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: 「買わん」 is a direct, casual abbreviation of 「買わない」, commonly used to express a strong personal
      stance in informal conversation among close acquaintances. It highlights a personal rule or habit
      in a straightforward manner.
    etymology: 「買わん」 is a colloquial contraction of 「買わない」 (kawanai), the negative form of the verb 「買う」
      (kau, to buy). The sound change from `wa + nai` to `wan` is a natural linguistic reduction for ease
      and speed of articulation in casual speech.
  - english: What are you reading right now?
    japanese:

          form.

    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    nuance: 「読んでん」 is a common, highly casual contraction of 「読んでいる」, typical in relaxed conversation.
      The sentence-final 「の」 makes the question softer and more inquisitive, common among friends or family.
    etymology: 「読んでん」 (yonden) is a contraction of 「読んでいる」 (yonde iru, is reading). This specific abbreviation,
      dropping the `i` from `iru` and contracting the remaining sounds to `n`, is a very common feature
      of casual spoken Japanese across different regions.
  - english: This cake isn't really that tasty.

        english: This cake isn't really that tasty (standard).
        hint: 「美味しくんない」 is a very casual abbreviation of 「美味しくない」. We're looking for the abbreviated negative
          form of the i-adjective.
    scene: Two young women sharing a dessert and one is a bit disappointed.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of `美味しくんない` is a very casual, almost childlike or overly informal abbreviation of
      `美味しくない`, often used by younger speakers, particularly females, to express a mild negative opinion.
      The 「ね」 at the end seeks agreement from the listener, making the comment conversational.
    etymology: 「美味しくんない」 is a colloquial contraction of the i-adjective negative form 「美味しくない」 (oishikunai).
      The `ku + nai` becomes `kun nai`, a phonetic reduction for quick, informal articulation, frequently
      heard in the speech of young people.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - そこ に は 絶対 行か ない！
        english: I just won't go there (standard).
        hint: 「行かん」 is a strong, assertive abbreviation of 「行かない」. We're looking for the abbreviated negative
          form used for emphasis.
      - competing_japanese:
          - そこ に は 絶対 行か ぬ！
        english: I absolutely will not go there (archaic/emphatic).
        hint: While 「ぬ」 is also a negative form, it is archaic and carries a more literary or forceful
          nuance, rather than the casual, direct refusal we are aiming for.
    scene: A stubborn person refusing to go to a certain place, speaking with firm resolve.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「行かん」 is a very strong, assertive, and somewhat rough abbreviation of 「行かない」, often used by
      male speakers to emphatically state a refusal. It can also carry a regional flavor, similar to Kansai
      dialect's use of 「~ん」 for negative, reinforcing the firm refusal. The exclamatory tone further emphasizes
      the speaker's resolve.
    etymology: 「行かん」 is a highly abbreviated form of 「行かない」 (ikanai, don't go), resulting from the elision
      of the 'ai' sound. This type of vigorous contraction, often ending in `~an` or `~en`, is characteristic
      of informal and sometimes regional Japanese, conveying a bluntness or strong determination.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how "ん" serves as a versatile abbreviation in highly casual
  Japanese. Pay close attention to the context and the specific form (e.g., "~ん" vs. "~んない" vs. "~てん")
  as they carry subtle nuances in terms of regionality, gender, and age, even within the broad category
  of 'casual speech'. Mastering these nuances allows for more natural and fluent communication.
