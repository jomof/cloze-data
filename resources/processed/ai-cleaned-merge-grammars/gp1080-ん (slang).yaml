    "etymology": "「ん」is a slang abbreviation derived from older or more casual pronunciations of 「ない」and「ている」. This type of abbreviation is common in informal speech to create smoother transitions between words and phrases.",
    "writeup": "The slang abbreviation 「ん」 is used to shorten negative verb endings and the progressive form 「ている」 in very casual speech. It's a way to make speech flow more smoothly.\n\n*   It primarily replaces sounds involving the rolling of the tongue, specifically 「ら, り, る, れ, ろ」.\n\nThere are two main ways 「ん」 is used:\n\n1.  Replacing the 「ら」 negative stem in verbs where 「る」 changes to 「ら」. This also applies to anything containing 「-らない」, such as the i-adjective 「つまらない」 (boring).\n2.  Replacing the entire 「いる」 in the 「ている」 progressive form of verbs.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「ん」 is always followed by something. It never ends a sentence on its own.\n*   If a sentence ends in 「ん」 and the negative stem hasn't been removed, it's likely an abbreviation of the classical-auxiliary verb 「ぬ」, similar to modern 「ない」, and conveys a forceful tone.\n*   「する」 changes to 「せん」, not 「しん」.",
