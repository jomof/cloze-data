        "[Noun] + の + とおり": "Indicates something happens exactly as specified by the noun.",

    "etymology": "The word 「とおり」 originates from the verb 「通る(とおる)」 (to pass through, to go along). As a noun, 「通り(とおり)」 means \"street\" or \"way.\" The grammatical usage extends this sense to mean \"in the way/manner of\" something.",
    "writeup": "The noun 「とおり」 means \"in that way,\" \"exactly,\" or \"just as.\" In kanji form, 「通り」 literally means \"street\" or \"way.\" As a grammar point, it indicates the degree of sameness between two things. It can follow verbs or nouns.  When it follows verbs, it's commonly used after both the dictionary form and the simple past form. 「～とおり」 or 「～どおり」 may be used directly after nouns, with 「～どおり」 being more common, especially in speech. Constructions like 「言ったとおり」 and 「その通り」 are polite ways to agree with someone, similar to saying \"That's exactly right!\"",
