    "etymology": "The word 「とおり」 originates from the verb 「通る(とおる)」 (to pass through, to go along). As a noun, 「通り(とおり)」 means \"street\" or \"way.\" The grammatical usage extends this sense to mean \"in the way/manner of\" something.",
    "writeup": "The Japanese word 「とおり」 (or 「どおり」) functions as a suffix indicating that something occurs **exactly** as, **precisely** as, or **just like** something else. While its kanji form, 「通り」, literally means 'street' or 'way', its grammatical usage extends this concept to denote a high degree of congruence or sameness.\n\nThis grammar point can follow both verbs and nouns.\n*   When attached to **verbs**, it typically appears after either the **dictionary (plain non-past) form** or the **plain past form**. For instance, 「言うとおり」 (as one says) or 「言ったとおり」 (as one said).\n*   When following **nouns**, two patterns are possible: 「[Noun] の とおり」 or 「[Noun] どおり」. Both are grammatically correct and convey the same meaning of \"according to the noun\" or \"just like the noun\". However, 「[Noun] どおり」 is generally more common, especially in spoken Japanese. Note that 「とおり」 without 「の」 directly after a noun is incorrect; it must be 「[Noun] の とおり」 or 「[Noun] どおり」.\n\nThis construction is frequently used in everyday conversation to express agreement. Phrases like 「言った通り」 or 「その通り」 are very common and serve as polite ways to affirm what another person has stated, translating to expressions such as \"That's exactly right!\" or \"Precisely!\"",
