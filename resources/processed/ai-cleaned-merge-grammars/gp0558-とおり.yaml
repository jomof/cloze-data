    "etymology": "The word 「とおり」 comes from the verb 「通る(とおる)」 (to pass through, to go along). It evolved to mean 'the way' or 'the manner' in which something is done or exists. The kanji form 「通り」 literally means 'street' or 'way'.",
    "writeup": "The noun 「とおり」 carries the meaning of \"in that way,\" or \"just like that.\" In its kanji form, 「通り」, it literally means \"street\" or \"way.\" However, it's regularly used to indicate the level of \"sameness\" one thing has with another. This \"sameness\" meaning appears when 「とおり」 is used as a suffix.\n\n「とおり」 (or 「どおり」) may be used with verbs or nouns. In the case of verbs, it is common to see it being used after both the plain form and the simple-past form. Both 「どおり」 and 「のとおり」 may be used directly after nouns. However, 「とおり」 will only be used when the case-marking particle 「の」 comes between the noun and 「とおり」.\n\nWhile both of these structures may be used interchangeably, 「どおり」 is more common, especially in speech.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   Constructions like 「言った通り」 and 「その通り」 are used very frequently as a polite way to agree with what has been said by another. In these cases, it translates similarly to \"that's exactly right\" or \"that's it!\"",
