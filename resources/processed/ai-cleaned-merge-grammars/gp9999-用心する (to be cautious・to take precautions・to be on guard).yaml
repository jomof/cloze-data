jlpt: N3
etymology: The word 用心 (yōjin) combines 用 (yō), meaning "use" or "business/affair," and 心 (shin/kokoro),
  meaning "heart" or "mind." Historically, it refers to "using one's mind" or "attending to something
  with care." This etymology highlights the active mental engagement involved in being cautious or taking
  precautions. It's not passive awareness but a deliberate application of one's attention to anticipate
  and avoid risks.
writeup: |-
  「用心する」means "to be cautious," "to take precautions," or "to be on guard." It emphasizes a conscious and active effort to prepare for or prevent potential problems, dangers, or undesirable outcomes. Unlike simply "being careful," which can be a momentary act, 「用心する」often implies a more sustained state of vigilance or a series of deliberate actions taken in advance.

  This grammar point is widely used in everyday conversation as well as in more formal contexts. It can apply to various situations, from personal safety to financial matters or dealing with difficult people. The nuance is that one is actively thinking ahead and taking steps to mitigate risk.

  For instance, if you're warned about a slippery road, you might 「足元 に 用心する」 (be careful of your footing). If there's a suspicious person, you might 「用心する」when walking alone at night. It can also be used in broader contexts, like 「冬 の インフルエンザ に 用心する」 (to take precautions against winter influenza).

  - term: 気をつける
    meaning: to be careful, to pay attention
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Very similar to 「用心する」, often interchangeable in casual contexts. However, 「気をつける」can also
      mean simply "to be mindful" or "to pay attention" without the strong implication of preventing a
      specific negative outcome. 「用心する」has a stronger sense of being on guard or taking defensive measures.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:気をつける (to be careful・to pay attention)
  - term: 警戒する
    meaning: to be vigilant, to be on alert

      immediate or perceived threat, and focuses on readiness for defense or counteraction. It's commonly
      used in contexts of security, crime, or military situations. While 「用心する」is about general caution,

    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「慎重になる」focuses on being prudent, discreet, or careful in decision-making or action to avoid
      errors or risks. It emphasizes deliberation and thoughtfulness. While related to caution, it's more
      about the *manner* of being careful rather than the act of taking *precautions* against a potential
      external threat, which is often the focus of 「用心する」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:慎重になる (to become cautious・prudent)
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions relate to being careful, they have distinct applications.

  attention or to warn. 「気をつける」is a more general term for being careful or mindful. 「警戒する」implies a heightened
  state of alert against a specific threat. Finally, 「慎重になる」describes a deliberative and prudent approach
  to actions or decisions. Choose the word that best reflects the specific kind of care or vigilance you
