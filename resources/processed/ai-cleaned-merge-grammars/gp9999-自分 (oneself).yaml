jlpt: N4
etymology: The word 「自分」 (じぶん) is composed of 「自」 (ji), meaning 'self,' and 「分」 (bun), meaning 'part'
  or 'share.' Historically, it referred to 'one's own part' or 'one's own portion.' Over time, its meaning
  broadened to encompass the entire individual 'self' or 'oneself,' reflecting a general reflexive nature.
  This evolution from a specific 'part' to the comprehensive 'self' highlights its role in denoting personal
  identity and individual action.
writeup: |-
  The Japanese word 「自分」 (じぶん) is a versatile pronoun primarily used to refer to "oneself" or "myself/yourself/himself/herself" reflexively. It acts as a general reflexive pronoun that can stand in for any person, much like "-self" pronouns in English.

  When used with the possessive particle 「の」 (no) as 「自分の」, it means "one's own" or "my/your/his/her own," indicating a close connection or ownership. For example, 「自分の部屋」 (jibun no heya) means "one's own room" or "my own room."

  Beyond its reflexive use, 「自分」 also functions as a first-person pronoun, meaning "I" or "me." This usage is generally casual and is more commonly associated with male speech. For instance, athletes often refer to themselves as 「自分」. It can also be employed in humble or self-effacing contexts when speaking to superiors, similar to how one might refer to themselves as "this one" or "your servant" in English to show deference.

  Furthermore, 「自分」 can describe an inherent aspect of one's identity or a particular state of being. Phrases like 「昔の自分」 (mukashi no jibun) meaning "my past self," or 「今の自分」 (ima no jibun) meaning "my current self," illustrate this usage, emphasizing a personal facet or state rather than just the physical person.

  - term: 私 (watashi)
    meaning: I, me (general, polite)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「私」 is a gender-neutral and polite first-person pronoun, suitable for most situations. In
      contrast, 「自分」 as a first-person pronoun is typically casual and often used by men or in contexts
      of self-reflection or humility.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:私 (i)
  - term: 僕 (boku)
    meaning: I, me (male, polite/casual)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「僕」 is a first-person pronoun primarily used by males, conveying a softer or more humble tone
      than 「俺」 but still less formal than 「私」. 「自分」, when used as a first-person pronoun, shares a casual
      male association but often carries a nuance of self-reliance or even slight roughness, or humility
      in specific contexts, distinguishing it from the more generalized "I" of 「僕」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:僕 (i, male)
  - term: 俺 (ore)
    meaning: I, me (male, very casual/rough)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「俺」 is a very casual, often rough, male first-person pronoun. While 「自分」 can also be a casual
      male pronoun, it doesn't carry the same degree of roughness or strong assertion as 「俺」. 「自分」 is
      more about the 'self' in a reflexive or personal sense.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:俺 (i, male)
  - term: 自己 (jiko)
    meaning: self- (prefix for compounds)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「自己」 is primarily used as a prefix to form compound nouns or concepts related to the 'self'
      (e.g., 自己紹介 - self-introduction, 自己分析 - self-analysis). It rarely stands alone as a pronoun. 「自分」,
      on the other hand, is a standalone pronoun/noun that can refer to the 'self' directly.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:自己 (self-prefix)
  - term: 自身 (jishin)
    meaning: oneself, itself (emphatic)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「自身」 is an emphatic reflexive pronoun, used to stress that the action is performed by the
      person or thing 'themselves' (e.g., 社長自身 - the president himself). It adds emphasis or confirmation.
      「自分」 is a more general reflexive pronoun, focusing on the act of self-reference rather than emphasizing
      the identity of the actor.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:自身 (oneself, emphatic)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「自分」, 「私」, 「僕」, and 「俺」 all refer to a person, their usage depends heavily
  on formality, gender, and the speaker's desired nuance. 「自分」 is versatile, serving as a general reflexive
  pronoun (like 'oneself'), or as a first-person pronoun with specific male or humble connotations. 「私」
  is the safest and most general 'I.' 「僕」 is a softer, more common 'I' for males, while 「俺」 is a very
  casual, often assertive 'I' for males. 「自己」 and 「自身」 are less about being a direct substitute for 'I'
  and more about specific concepts or emphasis regarding the self.

          - 私 は 今 の 私 を 変え たい。
        english: I want to change my current 'I' (as a general pronoun).
        hint: While technically understandable, '私' (watashi) here sounds less natural for reflecting

    scene: Someone reflecting on their habits and desiring personal growth.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The use of 「今の自分」 emphasizes the current state or identity of the speaker's 'self' that they
      wish to change, rather than simply 'me' as a pronoun.

        english: The athlete said, "I will never give up." (Standard 'I')
        hint: While '私' (watashi) is grammatically correct, '自分' (jibun) is often used by athletes to

          for that specific nuance.

      interviews.

    scene: A man is describing his personality to a close friend.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: A male speaker might use 「自分」 as the first-person pronoun 「自分のこと」 to describe a characteristic
      related to their inner 'self' or personality, often implying a focus on one's own thoughts or needs.
      This highlights a subtle self-referential nuance.

          - この 件 は 私 が 責任 を 取り ます。
        english: I (female speaker) will take responsibility for this. (Standard polite 'I')
        hint: While '私' (watashi) is polite, '自分' (jibun) can be used by female speakers in humble contexts,
          especially in formal business settings, to convey self-effacement when taking responsibility.
          We're looking for that specific nuance.
    scene: A female employee addresses her manager about a mistake.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: While less common for female speakers in general conversation, using 「自分」 as a first-person
      pronoun, such as 「自分が責任を取ります」, can convey a sense of humility and responsibility in a formal or
      business context, especially when addressing a superior. It shifts focus to the individual's direct
      involvement in taking accountability.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「自分」 functions not only as a simple reflexive pronoun
  but also how its usage can imbue sentences with nuances of self-reliance, personal ownership, and even
  specific registers or gender associations, depending on the context and the speaker's intent.
