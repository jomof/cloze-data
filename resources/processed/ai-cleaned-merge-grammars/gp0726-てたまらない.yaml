    "details": {
        "usage-context": "This expression is generally used in a standard context and is widely applicable across various situations.",
        "logical-flow": "Indicates an intense state or feeling that is difficult to endure or control, often leading to a natural consequence or expression.",
        "temporal-flow": "Describes an ongoing state or feeling at the moment of utterance, or a past state if conjugated to past tense.",
        "spatial-flow": "Not applicable; focuses on internal states or feelings."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てたまらない」 combines the 「て」 form of a verb or adjective with 「堪らない (たまらない)」. The verb 堪る (たまる) literally means \"to endure,\" \"to bear,\" or \"to tolerate.\" Therefore, 「堪らない」 means \"cannot endure,\" or \"cannot tolerate.\" When appended to the 「て」 form of a verb or adjective, it vividly conveys the idea that the preceding feeling or desire is so intense or overwhelming that one literally 'cannot bear it' or 'cannot stand it.' This etymological root strongly underpins its meaning of an irresistible urge or an unbearable state.",
    "writeup": "「てたまらない」 expresses a feeling or desire that is overwhelming, intense, or unbearable. It manifests in two primary nuances, depending on what precedes it:\n\n*   **\"Can't help but want to (A)\"**: This nuance is exclusively used with verbs conjugated into their 「たい」 form. It signifies an irresistible and profound desire to perform an action. For instance, 「～たくてたまらない」 indicates an overwhelming urge, meaning \"I can't help but want to do ~.\"\n\n*   **\"Extremely (A)\" or \"Unbearably (A)\"**: This nuance is applied to both い-adjectives and な-adjectives, indicating an extreme state or feeling that is difficult to endure. For い-adjectives, it takes the form 「～くてたまらない」 (e.g., 「暑くてたまらない」 - \"It's unbearably hot\"). For な-adjectives, it uses 「～でたまらない」 (e.g., 「心配でたまらない」 - \"I'm unbearably worried\"). In essence, the speaker is expressing that the feeling or state is so strong it cannot be tolerated.",

            "term": "てならない",
            "meaning": "Very, Extremely, Can't help but do",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both express strong feelings, 「てならない」 often implies a more natural or spontaneous emergence of emotion, almost as if the feeling 'naturally becomes' so. In contrast, 「てたまらない」 emphasizes the feeling's intensity to the point of being unbearable or difficult to control, suggesting a deeper, more physically impactful sensation."
        },
        {
            "term": "ざるを得ない",
            "meaning": "Can't help doing, Have no choice but",
            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "「ざるを得ない」 denotes an action that one is forced to take due to circumstances, indicating a lack of choice. 「てたまらない」, however, describes an internal, overwhelming feeling or desire that is difficult to suppress, not an external obligation to act."

            "term": "てしょうがない",
            "meaning": "Extremely, Very, Really, It can't be helped",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「てしょうがない」, like 「てたまらない」, expresses a strong feeling. However, 「てしょうがない」 can carry a nuance of resignation or acceptance, implying that the feeling is intense but 'cannot be helped' or 'is pointless to resist.' 「てたまらない」 focuses more purely on the sheer unbearable intensity of the feeling itself."
        },
        {
            "term": "ないわけにはいかない",
            "meaning": "Can't not, No way to avoid",
            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "「ないわけにはいかない」 signifies a strong obligation or necessity to do something; one simply 'cannot not do it.' This is distinct from 「てたまらない」, which conveys an overwhelming internal feeling or desire rather than an external compulsion."

            "term": "ことに",
            "meaning": "Extremely, Especially, To my...",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ことに」 is typically used to highlight an aspect or emotion with a sense of surprise or strong realization, often appearing before a noun or adjective to emphasize it (e.g., 「残念なことに」 - 'regrettably'). 「てたまらない」, in contrast, specifically describes an overwhelming, unbearable internal state or desire, directly modifying a verb or adjective."

            "meaning": "Cannot help doing something, Cannot resist doing something",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ずにはいられない」 indicates an irresistible urge to perform an action, akin to 'cannot help but do.' While similar to 「てたまらない」 when used with the 「たい」 form, 「てたまらない」 is broader, also applying to adjectives to describe an overwhelming state (e.g., 'unbearably hot'), whereas 「ずにはいられない」 always implies an action."
        },
        {
            "term": "限りだ",
            "meaning": "Extremely, Really, Very, As ... as one can be",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「限りだ」 expresses the utmost degree of a certain emotion or state, often implying a logical conclusion based on external observation (e.g., 「残念な限りだ」 - 'It's as regrettable as can be'). 「てたまらない」 focuses on an internal, unbearable feeling or desire, emphasizing the personal difficulty in enduring it."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing between these similar expressions, consider whether the grammar point emphasizes an internal, unbearable feeling, an irresistible urge, or an external obligation. 「てたまらない」 consistently highlights the overwhelming, almost intolerable nature of a feeling or desire. Other expressions might focus on the natural emergence of a feeling, a forced action, or a logical degree of a state, but rarely carry the direct sense of 'unbearability' as strongly as 「てたまらない」.",
