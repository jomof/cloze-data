    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てたまらない」 combines the 「て」 form of a verb or adjective with 「堪らない (たまらない)」, which literally means \"cannot endure\" or \"cannot tolerate.\" This expresses the idea that the feeling or desire is so strong that one cannot bear it.",
    "writeup": "「てたまらない」 expresses a feeling or desire that is overwhelming or unbearable. It has two main nuances:\n\n*   **\"Can't help but want to (A)\"**: This nuance is used with verbs in the 「たい」 form, indicating an irresistible desire. For example, 「～たくてたまらない」 means \"I can't help but want to do ~.\"\n*   **\"Extremely (A)\"**: This nuance is used with both い-adjectives (conjugated to 「～くてたまらない」) and な-adjectives (conjugated to 「～でたまらない」), indicating an extreme state or feeling. For example, 「暑くてたまらない」 means \"It's unbearably hot.\" The more literal interpretation is that something is \"unbearably (A).\" Note that で will replace て when な-Adjectives are used.",
