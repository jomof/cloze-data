        "Usage Context": "This expression is generally used in a standard context and is widely applicable across various situations."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てたまらない」 combines the 「て」 form of a verb or adjective with 「堪らない (たまらない)」. The verb 堪る (たまる) literally means \"to endure,\" \"to bear,\" or \"to tolerate.\" Therefore, 「堪らない」 means \"cannot endure,\" or \"cannot tolerate.\" When appended to the 「て」 form of a verb or adjective, it vividly conveys the idea that the preceding feeling or desire is so intense or overwhelming that one literally 'cannot bear it' or 'cannot stand it.' This etymological root strongly underpins its meaning of an irresistible urge or an unbearable state.",
    "writeup": "「てたまらない」 expresses a feeling or desire that is overwhelming, intense, or unbearable. It manifests in two primary nuances, depending on what precedes it:\n\n*   **\"Can't help but want to (A)\"**: This nuance is exclusively used with verbs conjugated into their 「たい」 form. It signifies an irresistible and profound desire to perform an action. For instance, 「～たくてたまらない」 indicates an overwhelming urge, meaning \"I can't help but want to do ~.\"\n\n*   **\"Extremely (A)\" or \"Unbearably (A)\"**: This nuance is applied to both い-adjectives and な-adjectives, indicating an extreme state or feeling that is difficult to endure. For い-adjectives, it takes the form 「～くてたまらない」 (e.g., 「暑くてたまらない」 - \"It's unbearably hot\"). For な-adjectives, it uses 「～でたまらない」 (e.g., 「心配でたまらない」 - \"I'm unbearably worried\"). In essence, the speaker is expressing that the feeling or state is so strong it cannot be tolerated.",
