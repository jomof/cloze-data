    "etymology": "「てたまらない」 comes from the particle 「て」, connecting to 「堪(たま)らない」, which is the negative form of the verb 「堪(た)える」 (taeru), meaning 'to endure' or 'to bear'. Thus, the literal sense is that something is 'unbearable' in its intensity, leading to the feeling of being unable to resist it.",
    "writeup": "「てたまらない」 expresses an emotion or desire that is overwhelming. It's formed by attaching 「て」 to the verb/adjective stem. Essentially, it conveys that a feeling is so strong it's unbearable.\n\n*   With verbs in the 「〜たい」 form, it means \"can't help but want to.\" For example, 「食べたくてたまらない」 (tabetakute tamaranai) means \"I can't help but want to eat.\"\n*   With い-adjectives, drop the 「い」 and add 「くて」 + 「たまらない」 to express that something is \"extremely\" something. For example, 「暑くてたまらない」 (atsukute tamaranai) means \"It's unbearably hot.\"\n*   With な-adjectives, add 「で」 + 「たまらない」 to express an extreme feeling. For example, 「心配でたまらない」 (shinpai de tamaranai) means \"I am extremely worried.\"",
