id: gp9999
meaning: alone; by oneself (physically)
pronunciation:
  katakana: ヒトリデ
  romaji: hitoride
formation:
  Noun (person) + で: Indicates an action performed by that single person without assistance.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The phrase combines 一人 (hitori), meaning "one person," and the particle で (de), which in this
  context functions to indicate the agent or means by which an action is performed. Historically, 一人 (hitori)
  itself derives from a combination of the numeral 一 (ichi) meaning 'one' and 人 (hito) meaning 'person',
  with the り sound being an archaic Japanese counting suffix. Thus, 一人で literally translates to something
  akin to "by one person" or "with one person as the agent," clearly denoting solitary action.
writeup: |-
  一人で (hitoride) is a fundamental Japanese phrase used to describe the act of doing something "alone" or "by oneself." It is constructed by taking the noun 一人 (hitori), which means "one person," and attaching the particle で. In this specific construction, the で particle functions to indicate the **means, method, or agent** of an action, thereby conveying that the action is performed solely by that one person, without help or company.

  This phrase is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of situations, from simple daily activities like eating or studying alone to more significant life decisions such as living or traveling alone. Its primary focus is on the **physical absence of others** or the **independent nature of the action**, rather than an emotional state of loneliness.

  While 一人で is generally neutral, the broader context of the sentence or the speaker's tone can sometimes imply associated feelings, but the phrase itself does not inherently carry connotations of sadness or isolation.
false_friends:
  - term: 孤独
    meaning: loneliness; isolation (noun)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 孤独 refers to the **emotional state** of being alone, often with negative connotations of isolation
      or sadness. In contrast, 一人で simply states the **factual circumstance** of performing an action
      without the presence of others, without necessarily implying any particular emotion.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:孤独 (loneliness)
  - term: 一人きり
    meaning: alone; by oneself (emphasizing exclusivity)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 一人きり emphasizes that there is **only one** person present, often implying a sense of being
      left alone, or specifically highlighting the sole presence to an exclusive degree. 一人で focuses on
      the **action** being performed independently, not necessarily the exclusivity of presence.
    grammar_point: 〜きり (only・just)
  - term: 勝手に
    meaning: on one's own accord; selfishly; arbitrarily
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 勝手に describes doing something by oneself *without consulting others* or *without permission*,
      often implying a selfish, arbitrary, or self-initiated action. While it involves acting independently,
      its core nuance differs significantly from 一人で, which merely states the absence of others.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:勝手に (on one's own accord)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'When distinguishing 一人で from other expressions, remember its core meaning:
  the factual state of performing an action without others present or assisting. 孤独 expresses the feeling
  of loneliness. 一人きり highlights that one is the *only* person, often with a sense of being left behind
  or exclusively alone. 勝手に describes acting independently, but with the added nuance of doing so without
  external input or permission, sometimes implying a lack of consideration for others.'

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female

      direct, typical of how a parent might comment on their child's activity. The gender of the speaker's
      isn't inherently marked by any particular Japanese phrasing in this sentence, but ～ている is a common
      neutral form.

      companion). In this context, it refers to a single child playing by themselves, not a group of children.

    register: formal
    setting: professional

      college.
    register: semi-formal

      by themselves.

      both mean dinner, with 夕食 sounding slightly more formal but both are common.

        english: It's dangerous to walk in loneliness at night.
        hint: 孤独 describes the emotional state, not the physical act of being by oneself. We're looking
          for a warning about walking without company.
    scene: A parent is giving a cautionary piece of advice to their teenage child about safety.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: cautious
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 夜道 (yomichi) specifically means 'night road', making the phrase more idiomatic. The particle
      よ (yo) at the end of 危ない よ adds a sense of assertion or warning, which is common in advice-giving
      contexts. This phrasing is gender-neutral and often used by parents regardless of their own gender
      or the listener's.
    etymology: 危ない (abunai) is an adjective stemming from 危うい (ayaui), signifying danger or peril. Its
      phonetic evolution emphasizes the sense of being 'at risk'.

          - 心配 し ない で、私 が 勝手 に これ を 運べ ます。
        english: Don't worry, I can arbitrarily carry this.
        hint: 勝手に suggests acting without consulting others or arbitrarily, which doesn't fit the context
          of carrying something for a friend. We're looking for the ability to carry something without
          help.
    scene: Someone reassures a friend who is offering help with a heavy item, indicating their self-sufficiency.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 俺 (ore) and the plain form 運べる よ (hakoberu yo) makes the second variation particularly
      masculine and casual. 大丈夫 (daijoubu) is a common casual way to say 'It's okay' or 'Don't worry'.
      ～から (kara) here indicates a reason or softening. The overall tone is one of confident self-reliance.
    etymology: 運ぶ (hakobu) 'to carry' is an old Japanese word, reflecting the physical act of transporting
      items. The potential form 運べる (hakoberu) implies the ability to do so.

        english: He wants to travel the world all alone someday.
        hint: 一人きり emphasizes being completely alone, which can sometimes imply a stronger sense of isolation
          than the simple fact of traveling without company. We're looking for the simple desire to travel
          solo.
    scene: Friends are discussing their long-term dreams and aspirations for the future.
    register: casual
    setting: optimistic
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 彼 (kare) refers to a male subject. ～たいと 思っています (tai to omotte imasu) means 'is
      thinking of wanting to do', expressing a desire. This phrase is generally gender-neutral for the
      speaker, but the sentence describes a male's aspirations.
    etymology: 世界 (sekai) combines 世 (se, world/generation) and 界 (kai, boundary/world), denoting the
      entire 'world'.

          - 彼女 は 時々 一人 カラオケ を 歌う の が 好き です。
        english: She sometimes likes to sing one-person karaoke.
        hint: While 一人 can modify a noun (e.g., 一人旅, solo trip), when describing an action done by oneself,
          一人で is the standard and most natural construction. We're looking for the act of singing karaoke
          by oneself.
    scene: Someone is describing their friend's unique hobbies or preferences.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The first variation uses 歌う (utau - to sing), while the second uses 行く (iku - to go), a common
      way to say 'go to karaoke'. Both 好きです (suki desu) and 好きだ (suki da) mean 'likes', with the latter
      being plain form. The gender of the speaker's isn't directly marked by the Japanese here, but the
      sentence structure is natural for a female speaker describing a friend.
    etymology: カラオケ (karaoke) is a well-known Japanese portmanteau from 空 (kara, empty) and オーケストラ (ōkesutora,
      orchestra), literally "empty orchestra."
  - english: I spent my birthday alone this year.
    japanese:
      - 今年 は 誕生 日 を {一人 で} 過ごし まし た。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 今年 は 誕生 日 を 孤独 に 過ごし まし た。
        english: This year, I spent my birthday in loneliness.
        hint: 孤独 describes the emotional state, not the physical act of being by oneself. The example
          is about the factual circumstance, even if it implies sadness. We're looking for the act of
          spending the day unaccompanied.
    scene: A person recounts their recent birthday experience to a sympathetic listener.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 過ごしました (sugoshimashita) is the polite past form of 'to spend'. The inclusion of 一人きりで (hitorikiri
      de) adds emphasis, suggesting a stronger sense of being completely by oneself, which can often carry
      a nuanced feeling of loneliness or isolation, especially when describing an event like a birthday.
      This nuance is stronger than simply 一人で.
    etymology: 誕生日 (tanjoubi) combines 誕 (tan, birth) and 生 (jou, life/birth) with 日 (bi, day), literally
      'birth day'. The word has maintained its meaning throughout its history.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in the examples, 一人で is primarily used to specify that an action
  is performed by a single person, emphasizing independence rather than an emotional state. It combines
  fluidly with various verb forms and can be used across different registers, depending on the formality
  of the accompanying verb and overall sentence structure. The choice between plain and polite forms,
  as well as specific pronouns, often depends on the speaker's gender, age, and relationship with the
  listener.
