    "etymology": "「って」 is a contraction of 「という」. Over time, the longer form was shortened for ease of speech, particularly in informal contexts.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「って」 is a highly colloquial and versatile way to introduce a topic in conversation, similar to saying \"speaking of...\" or \"regarding...\". It is primarily used to shift the conversation to a new, but often related, subject that has just come to mind or was implicitly part of the discussion. This makes the conversation feel more natural and fluid. It adds a casual tone and allows for a smooth transition without needing more formal lead-ins. 「って」 can directly follow nouns, verbs, and い-adjectives. When used with verbs or い-adjectives, they must be in their informal (plain) non-past form. For example, for the verb 行く (iku, to go), you would use 行くって (iku tte). For the い-adjective 寒い (samui, cold), you would use 寒いって (samui tte). An important nuance is its usage with な-adjectives. Generally, 「って」 does not directly follow the stem of a typical な-adjective. However, it can be used with な-adjectives that can also function as nouns, such as 健康 (kenkō, healthy/health), 孤独 (kodoku, lonely/loneliness), or 親切 (shinsetsu, kind/kindness). In these cases, it's functioning as if it's following a noun, reinforcing the casual topic-introducing role. While it's similar to 「といえば」 or 「というと」, 「って」 is more colloquial and immediate, often prompted by a recent statement or shared context.",

It functions to bring up a subject that might just have occurred to the speaker, inviting the listener to elaborate. 「どんな夢」 specifically asks for the 'type' or 'nature' of the dreams. The informal 「見るの？」 is a typical casual question format.",
            "etymology": "The ability of 「って」 to introduce even abstract topics like 「夢」 (dreams) highlights its versatility as a conversational lubricant. Its origin from 「という」 allows it to act as a bridge, smoothly connecting previous thoughts or observations to a new, spontaneously introduced subject, making the dialogue feel effortless."

The sentence-final particle 「よね」 seeks agreement, emphasizing shared experience and sentiment regarding the movie's length. This is a common pattern in casual conversation to share observations.",
            "etymology": "This informal usage of 「って」, deriving from 「という」, facilitates a natural and unforced flow of conversation, allowing speakers to easily introduce topics that come to mind within a shared context, as if saying 'You know that movie? Well...'"

    "post_example_writeup": "「って」 offers a distinct nuance from other topic markers or phrases, often implying a spontaneous introduction of a topic that has just entered the speaker's mind or is derived from the immediate context. This distinguishes it from more formal expressions like 「については」 or the neutral topic marker 「は」, which simply state the topic without the same sense of immediacy or conversational flow. Understanding these subtle differences is key to using 「って」 naturally.",
