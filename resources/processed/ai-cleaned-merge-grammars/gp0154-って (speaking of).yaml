  katakana: ッテ

jlpt: N4
etymology: The particle 「って」 is a contracted and casual form of the quotation particle 「と」. Over time,
  「と」, especially in its conversational usage for quoting or stating facts, evolved to be pronounced as
  「って」. This casual form then extended its function to also introduce topics, much like 「は」, but retaining
  a more informal and conversational nuance. Its origin from 「と」 explains its flexibility in marking not
  just direct speech but also subjects or topics that are being 'quoted' or brought up for discussion.
writeup: 「って」 is a highly versatile and frequently used particle in casual Japanese conversation. It primarily
  serves as a casual topic marker, similar to 「は」, but with a more informal and conversational tone. It's
  often used when you want to bring up a topic that was just mentioned, or is implicitly understood from
  the context, as a way to continue or shift the conversation. It can be thought of as "speaking of...",
  "as for...", or "you know (that thing about)..."&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Unlike the more neutral and formal
  topic marker 「は」, 「って」 carries a sense of familiarity or can sometimes imply a slight surprise or emphasis
  on the topic being introduced. It's particularly common among friends and family, or in situations where
  a relaxed atmosphere is present.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;While 「って」 shares some functions with 「と」 (the quotation
  particle), its use as a topic marker means it's not always quoting. Instead, it's casually bringing
  a subject to the listener's attention. Understanding its casual nature is key; using it in formal settings
  would be inappropriate.

  - term: と (quotation marker)
    meaning: quotation marker; means "that" or "and"
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「と」 is the formal equivalent from which 「って」 derives for quotation. While 「と」 can introduce
      reported speech or thoughts, 「って」 is the casual form and also functions as a topic marker, which
      「と」 does not.
    grammar_point: と (quotation marker)
  - term: は (topic and contrast)
    meaning: topic marker; contrast marker
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「は」 is a neutral and formal topic marker, clearly indicating the main subject. 「って」 is a casual
      topic marker, often used to pick up on a previously mentioned subject or introduce one informally,
      with a more conversational flow.
    grammar_point: は (topic and contrast)
  - term: という (naming and definition)
    meaning: refers to; called
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「という」 is used to define, name, or explain something formally. 「って」 is a casual contraction
      of 「という」 in certain contexts, particularly when referring to something or someone in an informal
      way (e.g., 「〜って言うの？」 meaning "What do you call ~?").
    grammar_point: という (naming and definition)
  - term: って (casual quotation・reason・topic)
    meaning: casual quotation; reason; topic
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This grammar point, 「って (speaking of)」, specifically focuses on its function as a topic marker.
      The broader 「って (casual quotation・reason・topic)」 encompasses this meaning, along with its use for
      casual quotation and giving reasons. The current grammar point focuses on a specific nuance of that
      broader category.

post_false_friends_writeup: While 「って」 can indeed serve multiple functions beyond just "speaking of,"
  such as conveying casual quotations or providing informal reasons, this particular entry highlights
  its distinct role in introducing or re-introducing a topic in conversation. It is a highly contextual
  particle, and its exact nuance often depends heavily on intonation and the surrounding conversational
  flow. Being mindful of the casual register is paramount when choosing to use 「って」 versus its more formal
  counterparts like 「と」 or 「は」.
