        "usage-context": "Used to introduce a topic, often based on something that was previously mentioned or is currently relevant.",
        "nuance": "It's similar to \"speaking of\" or \"regarding\" something. It's often used to shift the conversation to something related to what was previously discussed."
    },
    "etymology": "「って」 is a contraction of 「という」. Over time, the longer form was shortened for ease of speech, particularly in informal contexts.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「って」 is a highly colloquial and versatile way to introduce a topic in conversation, similar to saying \"speaking of...\" or \"regarding...\". It is primarily used to shift the conversation to a new, but often related, subject that has just come to mind or was implicitly part of the discussion. This makes the conversation feel more natural and fluid. It adds a casual tone and allows for a smooth transition without needing more formal lead-ins.\n\n「って」 can directly follow nouns, verbs, and い-adjectives. When used with verbs or い-adjectives, they must be in their informal (plain) non-past form. For example, for the verb 行く (iku, to go), you would use 行くって (iku tte). For the い-adjective 寒い (samui, cold), you would use 寒いって (samui tte).\n\nAn important nuance is its usage with な-adjectives. Generally, 「って」 does not directly follow the stem of a typical な-adjective. However, it can be used with な-adjectives that can also function as nouns, such as 健康 (kenkō, healthy/health), 孤独 (kodoku, lonely/loneliness), or 親切 (shinsetsu, kind/kindness). In these cases, it's functioning as if it's following a noun, reinforcing the casual topic-introducing role. While it's similar to 「といえば」 or 「というと」, 「って」 is more colloquial and immediate, often prompted by a recent statement or shared context.",
