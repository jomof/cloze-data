    "writeup": "The particle 「って」 is a colloquial way to introduce a topic. It's similar to \"speaking of\" or \"regarding\" something. It's often used to shift the conversation to something related to what was previously discussed. It can follow nouns, verbs (in their informal non-past form), and い-adjectives (in their informal non-past form). However, be cautious when using it with な-adjectives; it's generally only appropriate if the な-adjective can also function as a noun (e.g., 「健康」, 「孤独」, 「親切」).",
