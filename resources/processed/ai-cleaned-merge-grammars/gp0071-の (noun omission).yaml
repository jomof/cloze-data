    "etymology": "The particle 「の」 originally served a broader function, including indicating possession and attribution. Over time, its usage expanded to allow for noun omission, leveraging the context already established in the conversation to avoid redundancy.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「の」 is commonly used to avoid repeating nouns that have already been mentioned or are easily understood from the context. This is similar to its possessive use, but the noun that would normally follow 「の」 is dropped to prevent unnecessary repetition. This omission is considered good practice in Japanese, as repeating words unnecessarily (重ね言葉) is generally avoided. Using 「の」 in this way is equivalent to using \"one\" in English to refer to a previously mentioned item. It is important to remember that this 「の」 is the same as the possessive 「の」; the following noun is simply omitted.",

            "nuance": "「私 の です」 indicates possession, but the noun 「傘」 is omitted because it's clear from the context.",
