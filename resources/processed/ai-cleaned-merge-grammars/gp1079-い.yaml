    "writeup": "「い」 is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese that adds a sense of familiarity and friendliness. It's often used by men when speaking to someone of a lower social position, typically someone younger. This particle softens the tone, making it less direct and more approachable. It is most commonly paired with 「か」, or the auxiliary verb 「だ」. It can also be used with more emphatic sentence-ending particles like 「わ」, 「や」, and 「ぞ」, or the auxiliary verb 「た」, though these combinations are less common.\n\nImportant considerations:\n\n*   While primarily used by men, women may occasionally use it, especially with 「か」, 「だ」, or 「わ」.\n*   Although uncommon, 「い」 can be used with the imperative form of verbs to soften the command.",
