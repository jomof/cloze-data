    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にとどまらず」 is derived from 「に」 (case marking particle), 「止(と)まる」 (tomaru - to stop, to remain), and 「ず」 (classical negative auxiliary verb). Literally, it means \"without stopping at,\" indicating that something extends beyond a certain limit.",
    "writeup": "「にとどまらず」 is a formal grammatical structure that conveys the meaning of \"not limited to,\" \"not only... but also,\" or \"not stopping at.\" It is constructed by combining the case marking particle 「に」, the verb 「止(と)まる」 (tomaru), meaning \"to stop\" or \"to remain,\" and the classical negative auxiliary verb 「ず」. This literally translates to \"without stopping at,\" thereby emphasizing that something extends beyond a specified limit or boundary. This expression is predominantly used in formal writing and sophisticated speech. It serves to highlight situations where a particular influence, effect, or characteristic broadens its scope, indicating that it extends beyond an initial, often expected, boundary. It can follow nouns, verbs in their dictionary form, い-adjectives (often with 「だけ」), or な-adjectives followed by 「である」. A crucial aspect of 「にとどまらず」 is that it is employed when the subsequent element (B) represents an expansion or spread directly related to the initial element (A). This implies that (B) is a natural consequence or further development of (A), rather than an unrelated concept. This nuance distinguishes it from more general expressions like 「だけでなく」, which do not necessarily carry the implication of exceeding or expanding from a pre-existing limit. It can be used to describe both positive and negative consequences of this expansion.",

            "meaning": "not only... but also",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「だけでなく」 is a versatile expression usable in both formal and informal contexts. Unlike 「にとどまらず」, it does not necessarily imply that something expands beyond an initial, inherent boundary, but rather simply adds another element to a list.",

            "term": "のみならず",
            "meaning": "not only... but also",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「のみならず」 is also a formal expression and is often interchangeable with 「にとどまらず」. However, 「のみならず」 tends to emphasize the addition of an element, while 「にとどまらず」 highlights the expansion or exceeding of a limit. While subtle, 「にとどまらず」 can feel more impactful in conveying a broader scope.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between 「にとどまらず」, 「だけでなく」, and 「のみならず」, consider the formality and the specific nuance you wish to convey. 「にとどまらず」 is a formal expression best suited for situations where you want to emphasize that something has expanded beyond its initial limits or scope. It is particularly effective for highlighting a broader impact or influence. 「だけでなく」 is far more common and flexible, fitting comfortably in both formal and informal settings, primarily indicating a simple addition of information. It does not carry the same strong sense of surpassing boundaries. 「のみならず」 shares the formality of 「にとどまらず」 and is often interchangeable, but it tends to place more emphasis on the additive nature of the information, rather than the expansion of a boundary.",
