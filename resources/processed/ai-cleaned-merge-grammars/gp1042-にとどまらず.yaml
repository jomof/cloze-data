    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にとどまらず」 is derived from 「に」 (case marking particle), 「止(と)まる」 (tomaru - to stop, to remain), and 「ず」 (classical negative auxiliary verb). Literally, it means \"without stopping at,\" indicating that something extends beyond a certain limit.",
    "writeup": "「にとどまらず」 is a formal grammatical structure that conveys the meaning of \"not limited to,\" \"not only... but also,\" or \"not stopping at.\" It is constructed by combining the case marking particle 「に」, the verb 「止(と)まる」 (tomaru), meaning \"to stop\" or \"to remain,\" and the classical negative auxiliary verb 「ず」. This literally translates to \"without stopping at,\" thereby emphasizing that something extends beyond a specified limit or boundary.\n\nThis expression is predominantly used in formal writing and sophisticated speech. It serves to highlight situations where a particular influence, effect, or characteristic broadens its scope, indicating that it extends beyond an initial, often expected, boundary. It can follow nouns, verbs in their dictionary form, い-adjectives (often with 「だけ」), or な-adjectives followed by 「である」.\n\nA crucial aspect of 「にとどまらず」 is that it is employed when the subsequent element (B) represents an expansion or spread directly related to the initial element (A). This implies that (B) is a natural consequence or further development of (A), rather than an unrelated concept. This nuance distinguishes it from more general expressions like 「だけでなく」, which do not necessarily carry the implication of exceeding or expanding from a pre-existing limit. It can be used to describe both positive and negative consequences of this expansion.",
