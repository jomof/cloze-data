    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にとどまらず」 is derived from 「に」 (case marking particle), 「止(と)まる」 (tomaru - to stop, to remain), and 「ず」 (classical negative auxiliary verb). Literally, it means \"without stopping at,\" indicating that something extends beyond a certain limit.",
    "writeup": "「にとどまらず」 is a formal structure used to express that something is not limited to a particular extent or scope, but goes beyond it. It combines the particle 「に」, the verb 「止(と)まる」 meaning \"to stop\" or \"to remain\", and the archaic negative auxiliary verb 「ず」. It's generally translated as \"not limited to (A)\" or \"not stopping at (A)\", and is used to highlight how something spreads beyond the initial boundary. It can follow nouns or verbs in their dictionary form.\n\nThis expression is used in formal writing and speech to emphasize the broad impact or influence of something, indicating that its effects or popularity extend further than initially expected. It can be used to highlight either positive or negative effects. It's crucial to remember that 「にとどまらず」 is used when (B) expands outward from the boundaries of (A), implying a direct connection between the two.",
