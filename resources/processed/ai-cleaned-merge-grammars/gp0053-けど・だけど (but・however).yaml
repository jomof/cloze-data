details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: casual
  particle-syntactic-function: conjunctive
  particle-pragmatic-function: discourse marker
  usage-context: general conversation
  function: connects two clauses, expressing contrast, concession, or a preliminary statement
  nuance: Indicates a mild contrast or reservation, often used to soften a statement or introduce background
    information. More casual than が or けれども.
etymology: けど is a shortened, more casual form of けれども (keredomo). けれども itself is generally understood
  to derive from 係る (kakaru, 'to concern, to relate to') + ども (domo), a conjunctive particle expressing
  concession, eventually contracting to けれど and then けど. Thus, the original sense conveyed 'though it
  relates to' or 'although it is concerned with'.
writeup: 'けど is a versatile conjunctive particle used to connect two clauses (A and B). It functions similarly
  to が, often conveying a sense of "while thinking about A, B," which translates to "but" or "however"
  in English. When けど follows a な-adjective or a noun, the linking verb だ is required, forming だけど. This
  makes だけど an essential part of the grammar point for these word types.けど is a more modern and casual
  form of けれども, and it exists on a spectrum of formality: Casual: けど Less Casual: けども Neutral/Slightly
  Formal: けれど Formal: けれども Most Formal/General: が. A significant feature of けど is that the phrase after
  it can often be omitted if its meaning is obvious from context or if the speaker wishes to imply something
  without explicitly stating it. This allows for a more subtle and nuanced communication style.'
false_friends:
  - term: が
    meaning: But, However
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar, が is generally more formal than けど. It can also serve as a subject marker,
      which is a different grammatical function.
    grammar_point: が (but)
  - term: だが・ですが
    meaning: But, However, Nevertheless
    kind: synonym
    nuance: だが and ですが are more formal alternatives to けど, often used in written or more formal spoken
      contexts. They tend to create a more definitive or emphatic contrast than けど.
    grammar_point: だが・ですが (but・however)
  - term: けれども
    meaning: But, although
    kind: synonym
    nuance: けれども is a more formal version of けど, typically used in writing or more polite speech. The
      difference in nuance is subtle, with けれども lending a slightly more refined and measured tone.
    grammar_point: けれども (but・although)
  - term: ところが
    meaning: However, even so, but, despite that
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: ところが indicates an unexpected result or a sudden change of circumstances. It emphasizes a strong,
      often surprising, contrast between the two clauses much more than けど.
    grammar_point: ところが (unexpected contrast)
  - term: のに
    meaning: Despite, although, even though
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike けど, のに expresses a stronger sense of unexpectedness or dissatisfaction, often implying
      blame or regret.
    grammar_point: のに (unexpected result)
  - term: ても
    meaning: Even if; even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 'While けど introduces a simple contrast or preliminary statement, ても implies a concession:
      ''even if'' something is true, the following clause still occurs. It often suggests a condition
      that does not prevent an outcome.'
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: しかしながら
    meaning: However; nevertheless
    kind: synonym
    nuance: しかしながら is a highly formal expression, primarily used in written language or very polite speech.
      It conveys a strong sense of 'however' or 'nevertheless' and is much more rigid and less conversational
      than けど.
    grammar_point: しかしながら (however・nevertheless)
  - term: それなのに
    meaning: And yet; despite that
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: それなのに emphasizes a sense of dissatisfaction or surprise because something occurred contrary
      to expectations or logical consequences. It is stronger than a simple contrast made with けど and
      often carries a negative emotional tone.
    grammar_point: それなのに (and yet・despite that)
  - term: ものの
    meaning: Although; but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ものの is a formal and literary expression for 'although' or 'but,' often introducing a factual
      qualification or a mild contradiction. It is generally not used in casual conversation like けど.
    grammar_point: ものの (although・but)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing けど with similar expressions, remember that けど is a versatile
  but casual conjunction that simply introduces a contrast or qualification. が is more formal and can
  connect clauses within a sentence. だが and ですが are even more formal and create a stronger sense of contrast.
  ところが highlights an unexpected outcome. のに carries a stronger nuance of unexpectedness or dissatisfaction.
  By paying attention to the register and the specific nuance you want to convey, you can choose the most
  appropriate expression for your needs.

          - この 映画 は 面白い の に、終わる まで 時間 が かかる よ。
        english: Even though this movie is interesting, it takes a long time to finish.
        hint: This phrasing implies a stronger sense of dissatisfaction or complaint about the movie's
          length, despite its interesting nature. We're looking for a more neutral contrasting opinion.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 映画 は 面白い けれど も、終わる まで 時間 が かかる よ。
        english: This movie is interesting, but it takes a long time to finish.
        hint: けれども implies a more formal or slightly more measured tone to the contrasting point. We're
          looking for a more direct and casual way to express a frank opinion.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 映画 は 面白い。ところ が、終わる まで 時間 が かかる よ。
        english: This movie is interesting. However, it takes a long time to finish.
        hint: ところが emphasizes a significant and often surprising contrast or unexpected development. We're
          looking for a milder, more direct way to express an opinion about a movie's length.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 映画 は 面白い。だ が、終わる まで 時間 が かかる。
        english: This movie is interesting. But, it takes a long time to finish.
        hint: だが provides a stronger, more definite contrast and is more formal. We're looking for a softer,
          more conversational way to state a contrasting opinion.
    scene: A man giving a frank review of a long movie to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker is expressing an opinion about the movie using 「けど」 to introduce a contrasting
      point, specifically the length. This direct yet softened critical feedback, common among male speakers,
      reflects a casual and straightforward conversational style.
  - english: Excuse me, I have a question.
    japanese:
      - すみ ませ ん {けど}、質問 が ある の です が。
      - すみ ませ ん {けど}、質問 が あり ます。
      - すい ませ ん {けど}、聞き たい こと が ある ん です けど。
      - 申し訳 あり ませ ん {けれど}、質問 が ござい ます。
    english_literally: Excuse me, but question exists.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - すみ ませ ん、質問 が あり ます。
        english: Excuse me, I have a question.
        hint: This is a direct statement and lacks the softening effect of けど. We're looking for a softer,
          more preliminary approach.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 質問 が あり ます。
        english: I have a question.
        hint: This is too abrupt and direct for approaching someone respectfully. We're looking for a
          polite, introductory phrase.
    scene: A student approaching their teacher after class.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: The use of 「けど」 here softens the directness of the question or request, making it more polite
      and less abrupt. It creates a pause for the listener to prepare for the upcoming statement, which
      is common in polite Japanese communication, especially when initiating interaction or making a request.
  - english: She is very honest, but sometimes she says too much.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は とても 正直 {だ けど}、時々 言い 過ぎる こと が ある。
      - 彼女 は とても 正直 {だ けど}、時々 余計 な こと を 言う よ ね。
      - 彼女 は 大変 正直 で ござい ます {けれど}、時折 申し上げる こと が 多い よう です。
      - 彼女 は とても 正直 です {けど}、時々 言い 過ぎ ます。
    english_literally: She is very honest, but sometimes says too much.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は とても 正直 だ が、時々 言い 過ぎる こと が ある。
        english: She is very honest, but sometimes she says too much.
        hint: While grammatically correct, が can sound more formal or direct when expressing a mild critique.
          We're looking for a more conversational and nuanced way to present a contrasting point.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は とても 正直 な の に、時々 言い 過ぎる こと が ある。
        english: Even though she is very honest, sometimes she says too much.
        hint: のに implies a stronger sense of unexpectedness or dissatisfaction. We're looking for a more
          neutral way to connect a positive trait with a minor negative one.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は とても 正直 けれど も、時々 言い 過ぎる こと が ある。
        english: She is very honest, but sometimes she says too much.
        hint: けれども is a more formal alternative. We're focusing on the casual, conversational usage of
          けど to soften the critique.
    scene: Two friends discussing a mutual acquaintance.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The female speaker uses 「正直だけど」 to introduce a positive trait (honesty) before a gentle critique
      (says too much). This indirect approach to criticism, where a positive is stated first, is common
      in Japanese conversation, particularly among female speakers, to maintain harmony and politeness
      while still conveying an observation.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, けど and だけど are highly versatile and frequently
  used in Japanese. They allow for smooth transitions between ideas, provide mild contrasts, or introduce
  background information before the main point. The choice between plain form + けど and polite form + けれど
  (or ですけど / だけど) depends entirely on the desired level of formality and the relationship with your interlocutor.
  Mastering this balance is key to sounding natural.
