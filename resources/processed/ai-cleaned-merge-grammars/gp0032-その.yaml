    "etymology": "「その」 (sono) is a demonstrative belonging to the 'Ko-So-A-Do' system. The 'so' element indicates something associated with the listener, either physically near them or within their realm of knowledge or experience. Historically, it derives from the Old Japanese demonstrative 'そ' (so) combined with the genitive particle 'の' (no), functioning as a pre-noun adjectival to modify a noun, akin to 'that of' or 'that belonging to'.",
    "writeup": "「その」 (sono) is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞, *rentaishi*) in Japanese. These words are unique because they do not conjugate, meaning their form always remains the same regardless of tense, mood, or politeness level. 「その」 always precedes a noun, directly modifying it.\n\nIts primary function is to refer to a noun that is either physically located near the listener, or that is part of the listener's immediate context or shared knowledge. While it translates to 'that' in English, its usage is distinct from 'this' (この, *kono*) or 'that over there' (あの, *ano*), which indicate proximity to the speaker or distance from both, respectively.\n\nConsider 「その」 when you are pointing to an object that is closer to the person you are speaking to, or when referring to a topic, idea, or situation that has just been discussed and is now 'with' the listener.",
