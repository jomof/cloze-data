    "etymology": "その is part of the demonstrative series (指示詞) which includes words like それ (that), そこ (there), この (this), あの (that over there), etc. Its root likely comes from older Japanese demonstratives, evolving to indicate something relatively close to the listener or previously mentioned in conversation.",
    "writeup": "その is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞 - rentaishi) in Japanese. These words, unlike adjectives that conjugate, always appear in the same form. その belongs to the same family of words as それ and そこ, and is used to identify a 'thing' that is near the listener or was previously mentioned in the conversation. As the name 'pre-noun adjectival' suggests, these words always appear before a noun and describe that noun in some way. It indicates something closer to the listener than to the speaker.",

            "register": "standard",
            "setting": "informative",
            "etymology": "映画 (eiga) means movie. 見る (miru) means to see, and is conjugated to the plain future/non-past form.",

            "etymology": "時計 (tokei) means clock, 高い (takai) means expensive, でしょう (deshou) expresses conjecture.",

            "nuance": "「ねえ」 softens the opening, while 「匂いだね」 seeks agreement, and creates a friendly, slightly flirty tone. 「その」 indicates the speaker is likely close enough to the listener to smell their perfume, enhancing the intimate feel."
