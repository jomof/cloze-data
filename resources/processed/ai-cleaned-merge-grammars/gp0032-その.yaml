    "etymology": "その belongs to the same demonstrative series as それ (that), そこ (there), and the archaic 彼の (kare no - his). It indicates something closer to the listener than the speaker.",
    "writeup": "その is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞, *rentaishi*) in Japanese. These words do not conjugate, meaning they always appear in the same form. その identifies a \"thing\" that is near the listener. As the name suggests, these words always appear before a noun, and describe that noun in some way. Think of it like the English word \"that\" when used before a noun.",
