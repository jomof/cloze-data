    "etymology": "The word 「結構 (けっこう)」 originally meant \"structure\" or \"construction.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the idea of something being \"well-structured\" or \"satisfactory,\" eventually leading to its use as an adverb meaning \"quite\" or as a polite refusal.",
    "writeup": "**Kekkou** (結構) is a versatile word with multiple uses. Primarily, it is used as an adverb meaning \"quite,\" \"fairly,\" or \"rather.\" For instance, 「結構大きい」 (kekkou ookii) translates to \"quite big.\" It is also frequently used as a polite way to decline an offer, similar to \"no, thank you\" or \"I'm fine\" in English. In this context, it is often accompanied by 「です」 (desu), forming 「結構です」 (kekkou desu). Although it can be written with the kanji 結構, it is also often written in hiragana as けっこう, especially in informal situations or for improved readability.",

                    "competing_grammar": "お 茶 は いりません。",
                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes a polite social setting where a direct 「いりません」 might sound too blunt or demanding. 「結構です」 is a softer, more common, and culturally appropriate way to decline offers in such situations."

                    "mitigation": "While 「とても」 means 'very', 「結構」 here adds a nuance of 'more interesting than I expected' or 'surprisingly interesting', which fits the scenario of a casual recommendation among peers and gives a more nuanced appraisal than a simple intensifier."

For example, 「結構高い」 (kekkou takai) simply means \"quite expensive.\" On the other hand, **nakanaka** (なかなか) often carries a subjective nuance, suggesting that something is better than anticipated or requires effort to achieve. For instance, 「なかなか良い」 (nakanaka yoi) can mean \"surprisingly good\" or \"not bad at all,\" while 「なかなか来ない」 (nakanaka konai) means \"it won't come easily\" or \"it's taking a long time to come.\" Pay attention to these subtle differences to use them accurately.",
