    "etymology": "The word 「結構 (けっこう)」 originally meant \"structure\" or \"construction.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the idea of something being \"well-structured\" or \"satisfactory,\" eventually leading to its use as an adverb meaning \"quite\" or as a polite refusal.",
    "writeup": "「結構」 is a word with multiple uses. Primarily, it functions as an adverb meaning \"quite,\" \"fairly,\" or \"rather.\" For example, 「結構大きい」 means \"quite big.\" It is also commonly used as a polite way to decline something, similar to saying \"no, thank you\" or \"I'm fine\" in English. When used in this context, it's often followed by 「です」, as in 「結構です」. Although 「結構」 is written with kanji, it is useful to practice writing it in hiragana, because it is commonly seen in that form.",
