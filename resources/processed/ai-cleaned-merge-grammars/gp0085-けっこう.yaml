    "etymology": "The word 「結構 (けっこう)」 originally meant \"structure\" or \"construction.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the idea of something being \"well-structured\" or \"satisfactory,\" eventually leading to its use as an adverb meaning \"quite\" or as a polite refusal.",
    "writeup": "「結構」 is a word with multiple uses. Primarily, it functions as an adverb meaning \"quite,\" \"fairly,\" or \"rather.\" For example, 「結構大きい」 means \"quite big.\" It is also commonly used as a polite way to decline something, similar to saying \"no, thank you\" or \"I'm fine\" in English. When used in this context, it's often followed by 「です」, as in 「結構です」. Although 「結構」 is written with kanji, it is useful to practice writing it in hiragana, because it is commonly seen in that form.",

For example, 「結構高い」 simply means \"quite expensive.\" In contrast, 「なかなか」 often carries a subjective overtone, suggesting that something is better or worse than expected, or that achieving it requires effort or is difficult. For instance, 「なかなか良い」 might imply \"surprisingly good\" or \"not bad at all,\" while 「なかなか来ない」 means \"it doesn't come easily/quickly.\" Pay attention to these subtle differences to use them precisely.",

Rule 6 states: 'For nuance, explain in English with Japanese references to the sentence, how this sentence exhibits how and why speaker_age, speaker_gender, listener_gender, and register applies and what it means.'",

Do not call them \"false friends\" in that section—just provide a short explanation of how to avoid mixing them up.' This was missing from the prior grammar point."
