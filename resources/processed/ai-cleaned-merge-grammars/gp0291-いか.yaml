    "etymology": "The term 「以下」 is composed of two kanji: 「以」 (i), meaning \"by means of\" or \"from,\" and 「下」 (ka), meaning \"below\" or \"under.\" Thus, 「以下」 literally signifies \"from below,\" indicating a value or position that is at or below a certain point. Its usage for \"the following\" evolved from its role in documents, signifying \"what comes below this point.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「以下」 (ika) serves two primary functions in Japanese, both derived from its literal meaning of \"below\" or \"under.\" It is essential for specifying limits and for introducing subsequent content. \n\nFirstly, 「以下」 is used to denote a quantity or value that is \"less than or equal to\" a stated amount. When attached directly to a numerical value, a counter, or an amount, it includes that specific amount as the upper boundary. For instance, 「５００円以下」 means \"500 yen or less.\" This is a precise and common usage in rules, specifications, and pricing.\n\nSecondly, 「以下」 is employed to mean \"the following\" or \"hereafter.\" This usage is particularly prevalent in written communication, such as official documents, reports, and presentations. Phrases like 「以下の通り」 (as follows) or 「以下の点にご注意ください」 (please note the following points) are standard ways to direct the reader's attention to information that will be presented immediately after. This function acts as a formal signpost, indicating that details are about to be laid out.",
