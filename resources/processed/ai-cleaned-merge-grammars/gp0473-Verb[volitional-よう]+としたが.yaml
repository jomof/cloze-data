        "Verb[volitional-よう] + としたが": "Indicates an attempt or intention to do something, but something interfered with it."

    "etymology": "「よう」 is the volitional form of a verb, expressing intention. 「とする」 means \"to try to do.\" 「が」 acts as a conjunction, indicating a contrast or unexpected result.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[volitional-よう] + としたが」 expresses an attempt, intention, or being on the verge of doing something, but something interfered with it. It conveys a sense of interruption or unrealized action. The 「が」 particle indicates a contrast or unexpected result.\n\nThis structure strongly suggests that the interruption was **unanticipated**, preventing the intended action from being completed. It is often used with verbs in the past tense (「ようとした」) to describe a past attempt that was thwarted. The \"but\" clause after 「が」 often describes the reason why the action could not be completed.",

    "change": "violation: Rule 0, Rule 6 (conjugations and examples consistency): Adjusted the 'conjugations' list to accurately reflect variations of the grammar point, explicitly categorizing by conjunction (e.g., 'past plain (conjunction が)'). Removed forms that do not preserve the 'tried to but' meaning, such as te-form and provisional conditional forms. Also added common conjunctions like 'けれど' and 'けど' to the list, as supported by the input's meaning warning.\nviolation: Rule 3 (meaning_warning): Added the 'meaning_warning' field from the input bunpro data, as it was missing in the prior version.\nsuggestion: Improved nuance in 'writeup': Expanded the 'writeup' to include the nuance that the interruption implied by the grammar point is often 'unanticipated,' drawing from the input bunpro data for richer detail.\nviolation: Rule 6 (example conjugation and content consistency): Modified examples to ensure the 'conjugation' field accurately reflects the specific Japanese phrasing used. Specifically, examples using 'とした時' and 'としたのに' were rephrased to use 'としたら' and 'としたけれど' to align strictly with the grammar point's defined acceptable conjunction patterns ('が', 'たら', 'けれど', 'けど').\nviolation: Rule 6 (speaker/listener gender/age diversity): Added 'speaker_gender' and 'speaker_age' to examples 1 and 3, and 'speaker_age' and 'listener_age' to example 4, along with corresponding 'nuance' explanations, to meet the prompt's diversity requirements for speaker/listener demographics. Nuance statements were updated to quote specific Japanese phrases related to gender/age as required.\nsuggestion: Improved clarity in 'false_friends' 'kind': Changed the 'kind' from 'synonym' to 'similar expression' for the false friend 'Verb[volitional]とする', as 'similar expression' is a more accurate description of its relationship to the main grammar point.\nviolation: Rule 20 (top-level fields): Removed the top-level 'bunpro' and 'lesson_order' fields that were present in the raw input but are not allowed in the final output JSON.",
