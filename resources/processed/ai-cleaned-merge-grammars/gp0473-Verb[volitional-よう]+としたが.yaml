    "etymology": "The phrase 「～ようとする」 combines the volitional form of a verb (～よう) which expresses a speaker's intention or will, with the verb 「とする」 meaning \"to try to do\" or \"to be about to do\". The particle 「と」 marks the preceding clause as a direct quotation or a thought/intention. The final particle 「が」 (or its variations like 「けれど」/「けど」) acts as a conjunction, indicating a contrast, an unexpected result, or an obstacle. Thus, the entire construction emphasizes an action that was intended or on the verge of happening, but was subsequently interrupted or prevented.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「Verb[volitional-よう] + としたが」 is used to describe a situation where someone was *about to* do something, or *tried to* do something, but an unexpected event or circumstance prevented the action from being completed. It conveys a sense of an interrupted or unrealized action.\n\nThis structure strongly implies that the interruption was **unanticipated** or unforeseen, thereby thwarting the intended action. It often describes a specific moment of initiation or intent that was then met with an obstacle. The clause after 「が」 typically provides the reason why the action could not be carried out.\n\nWhile 「～ようとする」 itself expresses intention or an attempt, the addition of 「が」 or similar concessive particles introduces a contrast, highlighting that the intended action did not come to fruition due to some interference.",
