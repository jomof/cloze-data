        "Verb[volitional-よう] + としたが": "Indicates an attempt or intention to do something, but something interfered with it."

    "jlpt": "N3",
    "meaning": "Tried to ~ but ~, Was about to ~ but ~, Was going to ~ but ~",

    "etymology": "「よう」 is the volitional form of a verb, expressing intention. 「とする」 means \"to try to do.\" 「が」 acts as a conjunction, indicating a contrast or unexpected result.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[volitional-よう] + としたが」 expresses an attempt, intention, or being on the verge of doing something, but something interfered with it. It conveys a sense of interruption or unrealized action. The 「が」 particle indicates a contrast or unexpected result.\n\nThis structure strongly suggests that the interruption was **unanticipated**, preventing the intended action from being completed. It is often used with verbs in the past tense (「ようとした」) to describe a past attempt that was thwarted. The \"but\" clause after 「が」 often describes the reason why the action could not be completed.",
