jlpt: N2
etymology: 'The term 以上 (ijō) consists of two kanji: 以 (i), meaning "by means of" or "because of," and
  上 (jō), meaning "above" or "on top." The addition of に (ni) turns it into an adverbial phrase, indicating
  a state or condition that exceeds a certain point. Thus, 以上に literally conveys the sense of "beyond
  what is above," or simply, "more than."'
writeup: The grammar point 「以上に」 is used to express that something is "more than," "no less than," or
  "even more" than a certain extent or expectation. It indicates that something exceeds a specific limit
  or goes beyond a certain level. This structure often appears after nouns, verbs, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives.
  In some cases, 「に」 can be replaced by 「の」 when emphasizing a specific amount or quantity measured in
  relation to something else.

  - term: だけでなく
    meaning: Not only... but also...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だけでなく」 indicates that something possesses an additional quality beyond an initial one. In
      contrast, 「以上に」 implies that the second quality is *more prominent* or *surprising* than the first,
      often overshadowing it.
    grammar_point: 〜だけでなく・〜ばかりでなく・〜ばかりか (not only... but also)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「より」 and 「以上」 both involve comparison, 「以上に」 emphasizes a surprising
  degree of excess beyond expectation. 「より」 is for simple, direct comparisons of quantity or quality.
  「以上」 denotes a minimum threshold that is met or surpassed. 「以上に」 focuses on something being greater
  than or surpassing what was thought or stated. Furthermore, 「だけでなく」 indicates multiple co-existing qualities.
  Unlike 「だけでなく」, 「以上に」 suggests that the subsequent quality is *more* pronounced or impactful than the
  preceding one.
