        "function": "Indicates an action performed without specific intent or full conscious attention, often leading to an unexpected result.",
        "nuance": "Implies a lack of focus on the action itself, rather than a complete absence of consciousness. The action might be intentional, but the manner or outcome is not. It often carries a subtle sense of inevitability or an unforeseen consequence arising from this unfocused state.",

        "colocation": "Frequently appears with verbs related to perception, listening, watching, thinking, or movement. Often followed by expressions denoting surprise, sudden realization, or unexpected events (e.g., ～たら、～ているうちに、～ところに).",

    "etymology": "The pattern combines the particle 「と」, the adverbial particle 「も」, and the conjunctive form of the い-adjective 「ない」. 「ともなしに」 pairs the noun 「なし」 'without' with 「に」. It suggests doing something without a specific intention or purpose.",
    "writeup": "The expressions 「ともなく」 and 「ともなしに」 indicate that action (A) was performed absentmindedly while action (B) occurred. It translates to \"unconsciously (A) when (B)\" or \"without paying attention to (A), (B).\" The structure for 「ともなく」 is a combination of the case-marking particle 「と」, the adverbial particle 「も」, and the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective 「ない」. 「ともなしに」 is similar, but pairs the noun 「なし」 ('without') with 「に」 instead of using the conjugative form of 「ない」.\n\nThis pattern often appears with 「たら」, emphasizing the specific timing of an event happening during another absentminded action. This pattern highlights that while the preceding action might be initiated intentionally, the subsequent result or discovery is often unforeseen, making the nuance closer to 'even if one wasn't actively intending to (B), while (A) was occurring, (B) happened.'",
