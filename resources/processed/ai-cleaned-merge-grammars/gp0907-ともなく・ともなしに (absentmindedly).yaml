jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Generally applicable across various contexts.
  function: Indicates an action performed without specific intent or full conscious attention, often leading
    to an unexpected result.
  nuance: Implies a lack of focus on the action itself, rather than a complete absence of consciousness.
    The action might be intentional, but the manner or outcome is not. It often carries a subtle sense
    of inevitability or an unforeseen consequence arising from this unfocused state.
  counterpoint: Distinguishes from simply 'not paying attention' by implying the action was still carried
    out, albeit without a clear purpose or full awareness.
  colocation: Frequently appears with verbs related to perception, listening, watching, thinking, or movement.
    Often followed by expressions denoting surprise, sudden realization, or unexpected events (e.g., ～たら、～ているうちに、～ところに).
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially, modifying the verb it precedes to describe the manner of the
    action.
  logical-flow: Presents a cause-and-effect relationship where the unfocused action is the 'cause' leading
    to an unforeseen 'effect' or outcome.
  temporal-flow: Often used to describe a continuous action (e.g., while doing X) that leads to an unexpected
    event or realization.
etymology: The pattern combines the particle 「と」, the adverbial particle 「も」, and the conjunctive form
  of the い-adjective 「ない」. 「ともなしに」 pairs the noun 「なし」 'without' with 「に」. It suggests doing something
  without a specific intention or purpose.
writeup: |-
  The expressions 「ともなく」 and 「ともなしに」 indicate that action (A) was performed absentmindedly while action (B) occurred. It translates to "unconsciously (A) when (B)" or "without paying attention to (A), (B)." The structure for 「ともなく」 is a combination of the case-marking particle 「と」, the adverbial particle 「も」, and the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective 「ない」. 「ともなしに」 is similar, but pairs the noun 「なし」 ('without') with 「に」 instead of using the conjugative form of 「ない」.

  This pattern often appears with 「たら」, emphasizing the specific timing of an event happening during another absentminded action. This pattern highlights that while the preceding action might be initiated intentionally, the subsequent result or discovery is often unforeseen, making the nuance closer to 'even if one wasn't actively intending to (B), while (A) was occurring, (B) happened.'

  - term: なんとなく
    meaning: somehow, for some reason, vaguely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: なんとなく implies a vague or unclear reason or intention behind an action. In contrast, ともなく・ともなしに
      emphasizes the lack of conscious attention or specific purpose *while* performing an action, often
      leading to an unintended outcome or discovery.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:なんとなく (somehow・for some reason・vaguely)
  - term: ぼーっと
    meaning: absentmindedly, blankly, dazedly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ぼーっと primarily describes a state of being unfocused, spaced out, or mentally blank. While
      it can precede an action, ともなく・ともなしに focuses more on the *action itself* being performed without
      conscious attention or specific purpose, and the *consequence* of that lack of attention. The act
      itself might be intentional, but the manner in which it's done or what results from it is not the
      main focus.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ぼーっと (absentmindedly・blankly・dazedly)
  - term: 無意識に
    meaning: unconsciously, involuntarily
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 無意識に strictly means without conscious thought or control, often referring to an automatic
      bodily reaction or a subconscious action. ともなく・ともなしに implies a lack of *specific intent or focus*
      rather than complete unconsciousness; it is often used when an action is performed passively or
      as a background activity, leading to an unplanned result.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:無意識に (unconsciously・involuntarily)
post_false_friends_writeup: When differentiating between these similar expressions, consider the level
  of consciousness and the relationship between the action and its outcome. ともなく・ともなしに highlights an action
  done without active attention, often leading to an unexpected result. なんとなく suggests a vague reason
  or feeling. ぼーっと describes a state of being mentally disengaged. 無意識に indicates a complete lack of conscious
  control over an action.

    scene: A student is reading a book but not fully engaged in its content, when an unexpected event
      occurs.

    setting: storytelling
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of the casual plain past form `驚いた` combined with the sentence-final particle `よ`
      is common in casual male speech to express a mild assertion or emphasis on the feeling of surprise.
      This example highlights how the act of reading was not done with full engagement, hence `読み かける
      と も なく`, leading to an unexpected outcome in `連絡 が 来 て 驚い た` (was surprised when contact came).

    nuance: The use of `慌てちゃった` (a contracted form of `慌ててしまった`) is a common informal expression, often
      used by female speakers to convey a slight sense of regret or mild embarrassment over an action
      that happened. Here, the doodling was not with purpose, hence `落書き する と も なく`, leading to the panic
