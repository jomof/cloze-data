    "writeup": "「仮に」 is an adverb used to introduce a hypothetical situation, a condition, or a supposition. It's similar to saying \"suppose,\" \"assuming that,\" or \"even if\" in English. It's often used in formal settings, discussions, or when making arguments. 「仮に」 is frequently paired with grammar patterns like 「としたら」, 「とすれば」, 「としても」, 「場合」, or the 「たら」 form to further emphasize the hypothetical nature of the statement.\n\n*   **Common Structures:**\n\n    *   「仮に〜としたら」: \"Supposing that ~\", \"If ~ were the case\"\n    *   「仮に〜としても」: \"Even if ~\", \"Even supposing that ~\"\n    *   「仮に〜場合」: \"In the case that ~\", \"If ~ were to happen\"\n    *   「仮に〜たら」: \"If ~\", (more casual)",
