jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  register: formal
  function: Specifies a numerical or quantitative limit that is strictly less than a stated value. It
    implies that the stated value itself is not included.
  nuance: This term conveys a strict inequality, meaning the given number or standard is explicitly excluded
    from the range. It is often used in official documents, regulations, and statistics.
  grammatical-role: nominal modifier
etymology: 'The term 未満 (miman) is a compound of two kanji: 未 (mi), meaning ''not yet'' or ''un-,'' and
  満 (man), meaning ''full,'' ''satisfied,'' or ''to reach.'' Therefore, 未満 literally translates to ''not
  yet full'' or ''not reaching the full amount,'' conveying the meaning of ''less than'' or ''under''
  a certain value. This etymology highlights the concept of falling short of a particular measure or threshold.'
writeup: |-
  未満 (miman) is a straightforward term used to indicate that a quantity, age, or value is strictly "less than" a specified number. It is crucial to understand that the number itself is **not** included in the range. For instance, 18歳未満 (juuhassai miman) means "under 18 years old," implying 17 years old and younger, but explicitly excluding 18. This contrasts with terms that include the boundary value.

  This term is very common in formal contexts such as laws, regulations, statistics, and official documents, where precision in numerical values is required. While it can be used in casual conversation, its formal nature makes it less frequent than looser expressions like 「〜より少ない」 (yori sukunai) or 「〜以下」 (ika) in everyday speech. Its usage is consistent across various demographic groups in Japan.
false_friends:
  - term: 以下 (less than or equal to)
    meaning: Less than or equal to; below or including
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike {未満}, {以下} is inclusive of the specified number, meaning the value can be equal to
      or less than the given number. For example, 10人以下 includes 10 people.
    grammar_point: 以下 (less than or equal to; the following)
  - term: より少ない (less than)
    meaning: Less than; fewer than
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「より少ない」 is a more general and flexible way to say 'less than' and is often used in casual
      conversation. While it also implies strict inequality, {未満} is preferred for formal, precise cut-offs
      like exam scores.
    grammar_point: 少ない (few・little)
  - term: 超える (to exceed)
    meaning: To exceed; to go over; to pass
    kind: antonym
    nuance: '{超える} expresses a value being greater than a certain limit, effectively the opposite of {未満}.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:超える (to exceed)
  - term: 以上 (more than or equal)
    meaning: More than or equal to; That's all.
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While {未満} defines a strict upper boundary (exclusive), {以上} defines an inclusive lower boundary,
      meaning the value can be equal to or more than the given number.
    grammar_point: 以上 (more than or equal)
  - term: 以内 (within)
    meaning: Within; Less than or equal to; Not exceeding
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '{以内} specifies a range from zero up to and including the stated number, whereas {未満} strictly
      excludes the number. For example, 5メートル以内 (within 5 meters) includes 5 meters, but 5メートル未満 (less
      than 5 meters) does not.'
    grammar_point: 以内 (within)
  - term: に満たない (not reaching)
    meaning: Not reaching; falling short of; less than
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '{に満たない} directly expresses ''not reaching'' a certain amount and implies ''less than''. It
      is often used to convey inadequacy or insufficiency, whereas {未満} is primarily a precise mathematical
      boundary.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:に満たない (not reaching)
post_false_friends_writeup: When working with numerical boundaries in Japanese, it is vital to distinguish
  between exclusive and inclusive limits. {未満} strictly means 'less than,' always excluding the number.
  Conversely, {以下} means 'less than or equal to,' including the number. Similarly, {以上} means 'greater
  than or equal to,' while expressions like {超える} indicate 'exceeding' a value. {以内} implies 'within'
  a range, including the upper limit. Use {未満} for strict exclusion, and be mindful of context and formality
  when choosing between precise terms like {未満} and more general expressions such as 「より少ない」 or 「に満たない」.
examples:
  - english: Children under 6 years old do not need a ticket.
    japanese:
      - 6 歳 {未満} の 子供 は チケット が 必要 あり ませ ん。
      - 6 歳 {未満} の お 子 様 は 切符 が いり ませ ん.
    english_literally: Children less than 6 years old ticket not necessary.

          - 6 歳 以下 の 子供 は チケット が 必要 あり ませ ん.
        english: Children 6 years old or younger do not need a ticket.
        hint: 「以下」 includes the stated number, meaning children exactly 6 years old would also not need
          a ticket. We're looking for strictly 'less than'.
    scene: A parent asking about ticket requirements at a train station.

    japanese:
      - 70 % {未満} の スコア の 人 だけ が 再 試験 を 受ける 必要 が あり ます。
      - 70 % {未満} の 成績 者 のみ 再 試験 が 必須 です.
    english_literally: Only people with a score less than 70% have necessity to take re-exam.
    competing_grammar:

          - 70 % より 少ない スコア の 人 だけ が 再 試験 を 受ける 必要 が あり ます.
        english: Only those with a score less than 70% will need to retake the exam.
        hint: While 「より少ない」 conveys 'less than,' {未満} is preferred for formal, precise cut-offs like exam
          scores. We're looking for the more formal term.
    scene: A teacher announcing exam results to a class.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「未満」 makes it clear that a score of exactly 70% would not require a retake, only
      scores below it, emphasizing strict adherence to the cutoff.
    etymology: The word 「再試験」 (saishiken) means 're-examination,' combining 「再」 (sai - re-, again) and
      「試験」 (shiken - examination).
  - english: This product is for external use only; please do not ingest even a small amount.
    japanese:
      - この 製品 は 外用 薬 です。微量 {未満} で も 摂取 し ない で ください。

    english_literally: This product external use medicine. Even less than a trace amount please do not
      ingest.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 製品 は 外用 薬 です。少し も 摂取 し ない で ください.
        english: This product is for external use only; please do not ingest even a little bit.
        hint: 「少しも」 means 'not even a little,' but doesn't convey the extreme, precise 'less than a trace
          amount' as strongly as {微量未満}.
    scene: Instructions on a medicine bottle.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: 「微量未満」 emphasizes that even an amount smaller than a 'trace amount' should not be ingested,
      stressing extreme caution. This use of 未満 highlights an extremely low, almost imperceptible threshold.
    etymology: The phrase 「口 に し ない で ください」 (kuchi ni shinai de kudasai) literally means 'please do not
      put in mouth,' a common way to say 'do not ingest.'
  - english: The number of attendees was less than 50, so the event was cancelled.
    japanese:
      - 参加 者 数 が 50 名 {未満} だっ た の で、イベント は 中止 と なり まし た。
      - 参加 者 数 が 50 名 {未満} の ため、イベント は 中止 と なり まし た.
    english_literally: Number of participants was less than 50 people, so event was cancelled.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 参加 者 数 が 50 名 以下 だっ た の で、イベント は 中止 と なり まし た.
        english: The number of attendees was 50 or less, so the event was cancelled.
        hint: 「以下」 includes 50 attendees. If exactly 50 attendees showed up, the event would still be
          cancelled. We're looking for strictly 'less than'.
    scene: An event organizer explaining the cancellation.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The phrase 「50名未満」 precisely indicates that the cutoff for cancellation was exactly 50 attendees,
      and they fell short of that number.
    etymology: 「中止」 (chuushi) means 'cancellation' or 'suspension,' formed from 「中」 (chuu - middle, in
      progress) and 「止」 (shi - stop). It implies stopping something that was planned or in progress.
  - english: If the temperature falls below 0 degrees Celsius, the pipes might freeze.
    japanese:

      is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 気温 が 摂氏 0 度 を 下回る と、パイプ が 凍る 可能 性 が あり ます.
        english: If the temperature falls below 0 degrees Celsius, the pipes might freeze.
        hint: 「下回る」 is a verb meaning 'to fall below,' and while correct, {未満} is typically used in formal,
          precise statements about thresholds.
    scene: A weather report or warning.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This sentence clearly states that 0 degrees Celsius itself is not cold enough for pipes to
      freeze, but any temperature strictly below it could cause freezing. The precision is important for
      cautionary warnings.
    etymology: 「摂氏」 (sesshi) is the Japanese term for Celsius, a loanword combining 「摂」 (setsu -攝, to
      control, absorb) and 「氏」 (shi - Mr., clan name), used to denote the scale as named after Anders
      Celsius. 「凍結」 (touketsu) means 'freezing,' combining 「凍」 (tou - freeze) and 「結」 (ketsu - tie, bind).
  - english: His income is less than the national average.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 収入 は 全国 平均 {未満} です。
      - 彼 の 収入 は 全国 平均 {未満} と なっ て い ます.
    english_literally: His income national average less than is.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 収入 は 全国 平均 より 少ない です.
        english: His income is less than the national average.
        hint: 「より少ない」 is more casual and general. {未満} conveys a more formal, precise comparison against
          a numerical average.
    scene: A discussion about economic status.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「未満」 highlights that his income is not merely 'below' the average but strictly
      'less than' it, often implying a quantifiable difference, which is fitting for a semi-formal discussion
      on statistics.
    etymology: 「全国平均」 (zenkoku heikin) means 'national average,' a compound of 「全国」 (zenkoku - whole country)
      and 「平均」 (heikin - average, balance).
  - english: All applicants must be under 30 years of age.
    japanese:

    english_literally: Applicants all, must be less than 30 years old.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 応募 者 は 全員、30 歳 まで の 者 と し ます.
        english: All applicants must be up to 30 years old.
        hint: 「まで」 (until) can be ambiguous regarding inclusion of the boundary. {未満} clearly excludes
          30 years old. We're looking for strict exclusion.
    scene: A job application requirement.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: 'In formal application requirements, 「30歳未満」 ensures clarity: applicants who are exactly 30
      years old are not eligible, only those who are 29 or younger.'
    etymology: 「応募者」 (ouboshya) means 'applicant,' combining 「応」 (ou - respond, comply) and 「募」 (bo -
      recruit, raise). This reflects the act of responding to a recruitment call.'
  - english: The success rate for this difficult procedure is less than 5%.
    japanese:
      - この 難しい 手術 の 成功 率 は 5 % {未満} です。
      - この 難しい 手術 の 成功 率 は 5 % {未満} と 見積 も られ ます.
    english_literally: This difficult surgery's success rate is less than 5%.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 難しい 手術 の 成功 率 は 5 % に 満た ない です.
        english: The success rate for this difficult procedure is less than 5%.
        hint: 「満たない」 also means 'less than,' but {未満} is a common and concise phrase for stating strict
          numerical cutoffs, especially in formal contexts.
    scene: A doctor explaining a medical procedure.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The precise use of 「未満」 communicates the low probability very strictly, indicating that a
      5% success rate is not achieved; it is always below that mark. This precision is critical in medical
      contexts.
    etymology: 「成功率」 (seikouritsu) means 'success rate,' a compound of 「成功」 (seikou - success) and 「率」
      (ritsu - rate, ratio).
  - english: Vehicles with an engine displacement of less than 50cc are classified as mopeds.
    japanese:
      - 排気 量 50 cc {未満} の 車両 は 原動 機 付 自転 車 に 分類 さ れ ます。
      - 50 cc {未満} の 排気 量 の 車両 は 原付 に 分類 さ れ ます.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 排気 量 50 cc まで の 車両 は 原動 機 付 自転 車 に 分類 さ れ ます.
        english: Vehicles with an engine displacement up to 50cc are classified as mopeds.
        hint: 「まで」 (up to) can imply inclusion. {未満} unambiguously excludes 50cc, which is vital for legal
          classifications.
    scene: A driving school lesson or traffic law explanation.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: This phrasing, often found in legal or technical specifications, leaves no ambiguity regarding
      the exact cutoff point for vehicle classification. Even 50cc exactly would not be included as a
      moped.
    etymology: 「原動機付自転車」 (gendoukitsuki jitensha) literally means 'motor-attached bicycle,' typically
      abbreviated to 原付 (gentsuki). It's a precise legal term, reflecting the legal and technical nature
      of the classification. 「分類」 (bunrui) means 'classification,' combining 「分」 (bun - divide) and 「類」
      (rui - sort, kind).
  - english: Despite the forecast, the actual rainfall was less than 10mm.
    japanese:
      - 予報 に 反し、実際 の 降水 量 は 10 mm {未満} でし た。
      - 予報 に も かかわら ず、実際 の 降水 量 は 10 mm {未満} でし た.
    english_literally: Contrary to forecast, actual precipitation was less than 10mm.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 予報 に 反し、実際 の 降水 量 は 10 mm を 下回っ た.
        english: Despite the forecast, the actual rainfall fell below 10mm.
        hint: 「下回る」 means 'to fall below,' and while it conveys the meaning, {未満} is a concise, standard
          expression for numerical thresholds.
    scene: A meteorologist giving a post-event weather summary.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Using 「未満」 provides a precise factual statement, emphasizing that the rainfall did not even
      reach the 10mm mark, which might imply a significant difference from expectations or a critical
      threshold.
    etymology: 「降水量」 (kousuiryou) means 'precipitation (amount),' combining 「降水」 (kousui - precipitation)
      and 「量」 (ryou - quantity, amount).
post_example_writeup: Understanding the precise boundaries that 「未満」 establishes is key. It's a common
  way to express strict upper limits in official or technical contexts. Pay close attention to whether
  the boundary number itself is included or excluded, as this is the primary distinction between 「未満」
  and similar expressions like 「以下」.
