jlpt: N1
etymology: The kanji 「如」 itself means 'like' or 'as'. The forms 「如し」 (gotoshi), 「如く」 (gotoku), and 「如き」
  (gotoki) are derived from classical Japanese and retain a formal, literary flavor. 「如し」 is the base
  or predicative form, 「如く」 is the adverbial form, and 「如き」 is the attributive form. This classical origin
  lends them an archaic and elevated feel, often found in literary works, proverbs, and set expressions.
  The core meaning of comparison is reinforced by the character 「如」, which literally means 'as if' or
  'like'. This characteristic can also be seen in common Japanese words like 「如何」 (いかが, 'how').
writeup: 「ごとし」 is an auxiliary adjective used to indicate that something resembles or is similar to something
  else, or that something appears a certain way. It is primarily found in formal, literary, or archaic
  contexts, often translated as "like," "as if," or "similar to." Unlike its more common counterparts
  such as 「ようだ」 or 「みたいだ」, 「ごとし」 lends a more elevated and poetic tone to the expression. It is frequently
  encountered in classical literature, proverbs, and set phrases, lending a sense of timelessness or profound
  observation. While 「ごとし」 can be used to make simple comparisons, its strength lies in creating vivid
  imagery or highlighting a striking resemblance, sometimes bordering on metaphor. It can also be used
  to describe actions or states that *appear* to be a certain way, even if they are not truly so, conveying
  a sense of pretense or strong impression. Due to its formal and literary nature, it is rarely used in
  casual everyday conversation.

  - term: ようだ
    meaning: Seem like; appear; like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようだ」 is more commonly used in everyday conversation and less formal than 「ごとし」. It can also
      imply conjecture or uncertainty about something. Colloquial and less formal than 「ごとし」; implies
      conjecture or uncertainty about something.
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
  - term: みたいだ
    meaning: Similar to; like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「みたいだ」 is the most casual of the three, typically used in informal speech. It conveys a subjective
      impression or informal comparison. Most casual and subjective of the three; used in informal speech.
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
  - term: かのように
    meaning: As if; like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「かのように」 is similar in formality to 「ごとし」 for hypothetical or feigned situations. However,
      「ごとし」 carries a more classical or literary nuance, often implying a stronger, more profound comparison
      or appearance, especially in set phrases. Similar in formality for hypothetical and feigned situations,
      but 「ごとし」 has a more classical or literary nuance and is often used in set phrases for stronger
      comparisons.
    grammar_point: かのようだ・かのように (as if)
  - term: さながら
    meaning: As if; just like; exactly like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「さながら」 is typically used for a strong, vivid, often exact comparison, where the appearance
      is almost indistinguishable from reality. It implies a high degree of resemblance and is more often
      used with nouns or nominal phrases than verbs directly. It often carries a dramatic or emphatic
      tone, similar to 「ごとし」 but perhaps less archaic. Used for strong, vivid, and often exact comparisons,
      implying indistinguishable appearance; carries a dramatic or emphatic tone, less archaic than 「ごとし」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:さながら (as if・just like・exactly like)
  - term: あたかも
    meaning: as if, just as if
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あたかも」 is an adverb that sets up a hypothetical or comparative situation. While it often pairs
      with expressions like 「〜のよう」 or 「〜のごとく」, it's not interchangeable as a particle/auxiliary verb and
      focuses on the condition, not the similarity itself.
    grammar_point: あたかも (just as if)
  - term: んばかりに
    meaning: as if about to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「んばかりに」 conveys the strong impression that something is on the verge of happening or looks
      as though it will. While 「如く」 expresses a general likeness or manner, 「んばかりに」 emphasizes an impending
      action or extreme state, often with a sense of overflowing emotion or intensity.
    grammar_point: んばかり (as if about to)
  - term: とは比べものにならない
    meaning: incomparable
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「如く」 draws a likeness, 「とは比べものにならない」 asserts that two things cannot be compared, usually
      because one is vastly superior or inferior. It’s a statement of extreme contrast or lack of equivalence,
      rather than similarity.
    grammar_point: とは比べものにならない (incomparable)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ように」 is commonly used to express similarity or purpose in modern Japanese,
  「如く」, 「如き」, and 「如し」 carry a much more formal and literary nuance. Choosing 「如く」 or its related forms
  conveys a deliberate stylistic choice, often found in poetry, classical texts, or highly formal discourse,
  to evoke a sense of tradition or elevated expression that 「ように」 simply does not. Furthermore, adverbs
  like 「あたかも」 and 「さながら」 also express similarity or hypothetical situations. 「あたかも」 functions to set up
  an 'as if' scenario, typically requiring a comparative phrase like 「〜のよう」 or 「〜のごとく」 to complete its
  meaning, emphasizing the condition rather than the direct likeness. In contrast, 「さながら」 conveys an exact
  or striking resemblance, often used for vivid, dramatic comparisons, implying that something is 'just
  like' or 'exactly like' something else, often even replacing the need for an explicit comparative particle.
  Additionally, 「んばかりに」 signifies that something is on the verge of occurring or appears to be in an extreme
  state, often conveying a sense of overflowing emotion or an immediate impression, while 「如く」 denotes
  a more general quality of being 'like' or 'as if'. Lastly, 「とは比べものにならない」 completely negates comparison,
  stating that something is so superior or inferior it's beyond comparison, a stark contrast to the core
  function of 「如く」 which is to establish similarity.

        english: Life is just like a dream.
        hint: 「さながら」 implies a stronger, more exact resemblance, often used for dramatic effect. While
          similar, 「ごとし」 is more general for this proverb. We're looking for the classical proverb.

        hint: The dramatic and forceful action is better emphasized by the strong comparative 「ごとく」, which
          portrays a more intense and overwhelming manner than the general 「ように」. We're looking for a
          more intense comparison.

          - 彼 は 嵐 {みたい に}、部屋 から 飛び出し た
        english: He burst out of the room like a storm.

          - 彼 は 嵐 {さながら に}、部屋 から 飛び出し た
        english: He burst out of the room just like a storm.

    register: formal
    setting: serious

    nuance: The phrase 「嵐 の {ごとく}」 (like a storm) vividly describes the sudden, powerful, and overwhelming
      manner of his exit, emphasizing the intensity of his emotion and action. The phrasing 「飛び出し た」 does
      not carry gender-specific nuances.
    etymology: The phrase 「嵐 の {ごとく}」 (like a storm) evokes a strong image of a sudden, powerful, and
      disruptive force, drawing on the raw power of nature to describe human action in a highly literary
      manner. It suggests a sense of inevitability and overwhelming force to the action, stemming from
      classical literary usage.

          - 彼女 の 瞳 は 星 の {よう な} 輝き を 放っ て い た
        english: Her eyes shone with a starlike brilliance.
        hint: The poetic and evocative description in a novel calls for the more elevated and profound
          comparison of 「ごとき」, which gives the brilliance a more striking and exceptional quality than
          the common 「ような」. We're looking for an elegant, literary comparison.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 の 瞳 は 星 {みたい な} 輝き を 放っ て い た
        english: Her eyes shone with a starlike brilliance.
        hint: The literary context and desire for an elegant description render the casual 「みたいな」 inappropriate.
          We're looking for a formal, artistic expression.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 の 瞳 は 星 {さながら の} 輝き を 放っ て い た
        english: Her eyes shone with a brilliance just like a star.
        hint: 「さながら」 implies an exact, vivid resemblance. While similar, 「ごとき」 offers a more classical
          and poetic nuance for this descriptive context. We're looking for a classical, poetic expression.
    scene: A novelist describing a character's mesmerizing gaze in a romantic scene.
    register: formal
    setting: creative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「星 の {ごとき} 輝き」 (brilliance like a star) uses the attributive form of 「ごとし」 to modify 「輝き」,
      emphasizing the extraordinary, dazzling quality of her eyes in a poetic manner. The phrasing 「輝き
      を 放っ て い た」 does not carry gender-specific nuances.
    etymology: The expression 「星 の {ごとき}」 (like a star) draws on the long-standing poetic tradition of
      comparing beauty or brilliance to celestial bodies in Japanese literature, reflecting a classical
      aesthetic sense.
  - english: The boy answered calmly, as if he knew everything.

        hint: To convey the strong impression or appearance of knowing everything, possibly hinting at
          a surprising maturity or feigned omniscience, 「かのごとし」 provides a more impactful observation
          than the general 「かのよう に」. We're looking for a more impactful observation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 少年 は 全て を 知っ て いる {みたい に}、冷静 に 答え た
        english: The boy answered calmly, as if he knew everything.
        hint: The formal setting of a classroom presentation makes the casual 「みたい に」 unsuitable. We're
          looking for a formal expression.
    scene: An experienced teacher questioning a precocious student during a class presentation.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「知っ て いる か の {ごとし}」 (as if he knew) implies a strong observation of the boy's demeanor.
      It suggests his calmness and answers gave the *impression* of comprehensive knowledge, possibly
      hinting at surprising maturity or a slight pretense. The 「かの」 adds a sense of unreality to the appearance.
      The speaker is an older female, but the sentence itself is a neutral description.
    etymology: The 「か」 in 「かのごとし」 serves as an interrogative particle, which here softens the assertion,
      creating the nuance of 'as if' or 'it seems like,' rather than a direct statement. This classical
      usage highlights an appearance or a hypothetical state.
  - english: This is a situation that feels like falling into despair.
    japanese:
      - これ は 絶望 に 陥る が {ごとき} 状況 だ

        hint: To convey the profound and overwhelming nature of the situation, the strong metaphorical
          comparison of 「がごとき」 is used, emphasizing the intensity of the feeling it evokes more effectively
          than the simpler 「ような」. We're looking for a strong metaphorical comparison.
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ は 絶望 に 陥る {みたい な} 状況 だ
        english: This is a situation that feels like falling into despair.
        hint: The serious and professional context of a project status update renders the casual 「みたい
          な」 inappropriate. We're looking for a formal expression.
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ は 絶望 に 陥る {さながら の} 状況 だ
        english: This is a situation just like falling into despair.
        hint: 「さながら」 implies an exact, vivid resemblance. While similar, 「がごとき」 often carries a more profound
          or dramatic sense of comparison in this context. We're looking for a more dramatic comparison.
    scene: A team leader describing a dire, seemingly hopeless project status to their colleagues.
    register: formal
    setting: pessimistic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「絶望 に 陥る が{ごとき} 状況」 describes the situation as being so dire that it is directly comparable
      to the experience of falling into despair. The use of 「がごとき」 here emphasizes the overwhelming sense
      of hopelessness. This usage is common in dramatic or serious descriptions. The phrasing does not
      carry gender-specific nuances.
    etymology: The use of 「が」 in 「がごとき」 or 「がごとし」 is a classical Japanese particle that functions like
      the modern subject particle 「が」, emphasizing the preceding phrase as the specific point of comparison.
      This reinforces the strong, almost definitive, nature of the comparison being made.
  - english: Time flies like an arrow.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 時間 は 矢 の {よう に} 過ぎる
        english: Time passes like an arrow.
        hint: This is a well-known Japanese proverb. Using 「ごとし」 preserves its classical, established
          form and meaning, which is more impactful for a proverb than a modern colloquial phrase like
          「時間 は 矢 の ように 過ぎる」. We're looking for the exact proverb.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 時間 は 矢 {みたい に} 過ぎる
        english: Time passes like an arrow.

          We're looking for the formal proverb.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 時間 は 矢 {さながら に} 過ぎる
        english: Time passes just like an arrow.
        hint: 「さながら」 implies a vivid resemblance, but this phrase is not part of the established proverb.
          We're looking for the classical proverb.
    scene: A mentor advising their young protégé to make the most of their limited time.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This is a fixed and widely recognized proverb (「光陰矢の{ごとし}」). 「矢 の {ごとし}」 is a set expression
      indicating extreme speed and irreversible progress. Its use underscores the formal and didactic
      nature of the advice. The older male speaker uses this classic phrase to impart wisdom, typical
      for a mentor figure.
    etymology: The proverb 「光陰矢の{ごとし}」 (Time is like an arrow) is a direct translation of a Chinese idiom
      (光陰如箭), highlighting the deep influence of classical Chinese thought and expression on Japanese
      literary and philosophical language. The use of 「ごとし」 directly reflects this classical origin.
  - english: She stared at me with eyes as cold as ice.

          - 彼女 は 氷 の {よう に}、冷たい 目 で 私 を 見つめ た
        english: She stared at me with eyes as cold as ice.
        hint: In a dramatic narrative, the stronger, more intense comparison of 「ごとく」 is used to vividly
          portray the chilling nature of her gaze, emphasizing its profound impact on the speaker more
          than the general 「ように」. We're looking for a more intense comparison.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 氷 {みたい に}、冷たい 目 で 私 を 見つめ た
        english: She stared at me with eyes as cold as ice.
        hint: The dramatic and descriptive context makes the casual 「みたい に」 entirely unsuitable for conveying
          such an impactful and intimidating gaze. We're looking for a formal, descriptive expression.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 氷 {さながら に}、冷たい 目 で 私 を 見つめ た
        english: She stared at me with eyes just like ice.
        hint: 「さながら」 implies an exact, vivid resemblance. While similar, 「ごとく」 offers a more classical
          and literary nuance to describe the chilling gaze. We're looking for a classical, literary expression.
    scene: A character in a dramatic play describing the intimidating gaze of an antagonist.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「氷 の {ごとく}」 adverbially describes the manner of her gaze, directly comparing its coldness
      and intensity to that of ice. This usage creates a powerful sensory image and conveys the speaker's
      emotional response to being stared at in such a way. The female speaker's description of another
      woman's gaze does not carry gender-specific nuances.
    etymology: The phrase 「氷 の {ごとく}」 (like ice) highlights a universal human experience of coldness and
      impersonality, using a natural element to describe a character's demeanor. This descriptive power
      is amplified by the classical tone of 「ごとく」, drawing on a long tradition of symbolic comparisons
      in literature.

        english: His life was truly a story as if it were a miracle.
        hint: To emphasize the profound, almost unbelievable nature of his life, 「である かのごとき」 provides
          a more elevated and emphatic comparison, fitting the formal and engaging tone of a biographical
          introduction better than 「である かのような」. We're looking for an elevated, emphatic comparison.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 人生 は まさに 奇跡 {みたい な} 物語 だっ た
        english: His life was truly a story as if it were a miracle.

          looking for a formal expression.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 人生 は まさに 奇跡 {さながら の} 物語 だっ た
        english: His life was truly a story just like a miracle.
        hint: 「さながら」 implies an exact and vivid resemblance, often used when the appearance is almost
          indistinguishable. While similar, 「かのごとき」 is preferred for describing a story that *seems* like
          a miracle, adding a nuanced sense of potential unreality often found in historical or biographical
          contexts. We're looking for a nuance of seeming, rather than exactness.
    scene: A biographer introducing the extraordinary life of a historical figure to an audience.
    register: formal
    setting: storytelling
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「奇跡 である か の {ごとき} 物語」 uses the formal 「である」 alongside 「かのごとき」 to modify 「物語」 (story). This
      construction emphasizes that the life story itself was so extraordinary that it seemed to embody
      the very essence of a miracle, heightening the descriptive impact for the audience. The female speaker's
      formal and descriptive language is suitable for addressing a group audience.
    etymology: The combination of 「である」 (the formal copula) with 「かのごとき」 creates a highly literary and
      emphatic comparison, reinforcing the idea of a profound, almost philosophical truth. This layered
      formality emphasizes the significance of the subject, often used in scholarly or biographical contexts.

        hint: To highlight the *surprising* and *impressive* nature of the new employee's confidence,
          which far exceeded expectations, 「がごとし」 provides a stronger, more striking comparison than the
          neutral 「の ように」. We're looking for a stronger, more striking comparison.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新人 は ベテラン {みたい に}、堂々 と 発表 し た
        english: The new employee presented confidently, like a veteran.

          a more formal comparison, making the casual 「みたい に」 unsuitable. We're looking for a formal comparison.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新人 は ベテラン {さながら に}、堂々 と 発表 し た
        english: The new employee presented confidently, just like a veteran.
        hint: 「さながら」 implies an exact and vivid resemblance, often used when the appearance is almost
          indistinguishable. While similar, 「がごとし」 retains a slightly more traditional or literary feel
          for a surprising observation. We're looking for a slightly more traditional observation.
    scene: A senior manager observing a surprisingly poised presentation by a new hire.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「ベテラン が{ごとし}」 implies that the new employee's confidence and presentation skills *appeared*
      to be at the level of a veteran, surpassing typical expectations for a newcomer. This conveys a
      sense of surprise and admiration from the observer. The older male speaker's observation uses a
      somewhat formal, almost proverbial tone, befitting his professional role.
    etymology: The use of 「がごとし」 in this context emphasizes the striking *appearance* of the new employee
      behaving like a veteran, often used to express a strong impression or a surprising deviation from
      the norm in formal settings.

        english: Youth is like a short summer, it passes in an instant.
        hint: The poetic and melancholic tone of reflection is better captured by the more literary and
          profound comparison of 「ごとし」, which emphasizes the deep resonance of the analogy between youth
          and summer's brevity, compared to the more straightforward 「よう に」. We're looking for a more
          literary and profound comparison.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 若 さ は 短い 夏 {みたい に}、あっ と いう 間 に 過ぎ去る
        english: Youth is like a short summer, it passes in an. We're looking for a poetic expression.
        hint: The reflective and somewhat wistful context makes the casual 「みたい に」 inappropriate, as it
          would diminish the poetic quality of the observation. We're looking for a poetic expression.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 若 さ は 短い 夏 {さながら に}、あっ と いう 間 に 過ぎ去る
        english: Youth is just like a short summer, it passes in an instant.
        hint: While 「さながら」 implies an exact resemblance, for this poetic reflection, 「ごとし」 better conveys
          the classical, slightly detached philosophical observation. We're looking for a classical, philosophical
          comparison.
    scene: An elderly person reflecting on the passage of time and their youth.
    register: formal
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「短い 夏 の {ごとし}」 functions as a poetic metaphor, equating the fleeting nature of youth to the
      briefness of summer. This comparison emphasizes the rapid passage of time and evokes a sense of
      wistfulness and transient beauty. The older female speaker uses this reflective language, typical
      for someone reminiscing about the past.
    etymology: The comparison of life stages to seasons is a common motif in poetry and literature across
      many cultures. The use of 「ごとし」 here adds a classical, almost timeless quality to this universal
      reflection on youth and the passage of time.
  - english: The world of dreams and reality are like two sides of the same coin.
    japanese:
      - 夢 と 現実 は 表裏 一体 の {ごとし}

          - 夢 と 現実 は 表裏 一体 の {よう だ}
        english: Dreams and reality are like two sides of the same coin.
        hint: This philosophical statement about the interconnectedness of dreams and reality requires
          the formal and emphatic tone of 「ごとし」 to convey the profound nature of the comparison, rather
          than the more common 「よう だ」. We're looking for a philosophical comparison.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 夢 と 現実 は 表裏 一体 {みたい だ}
        english: Dreams and reality are like two sides of the same coin.
        hint: The academic context of a psychology lecture makes the casual 「みたい だ」 inappropriate for
          conveying complex philosophical ideas. We're looking for a formal, academic expression.
    scene: A psychology professor explaining the relationship between conscious and subconscious states.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「表裏一体 の {ごとし}」 emphasizes a profound, intrinsic connection, suggesting that dreams and reality
      are inseparable despite their apparent differences, much like the two sides of a coin. This is a
      common philosophical metaphor. The male professor uses this formal expression to convey a deep concept
      to students.
    etymology: The phrase 「表裏一体」 (hyōri-ittai) literally means 'front and back are one body', signifying
      two things that are seemingly opposite but are inseparably linked. Combining it with 「ごとし」 enhances
      the philosophical depth, indicating a fundamental, almost inherent, resemblance.
  - english: The old master's words were profound, like a Zen koan.

        english: The old master's words were profound, like a Zen koan.
        hint: To convey the enigmatic and deeply insightful nature of the words, drawing a precise parallel
          to a Zen koan, the specific and formal 「がごとし」 is more fitting than the general 「よう に」. We're
          looking for a precise, formal parallel.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 老師 の 言葉 は 禅 の 公案 {みたい に}、深く 響い た
        english: The old master's words were profound, like a Zen koan.
        hint: The context of profound, spiritual wisdom from an old master makes the casual 「みたい に」 entirely
          inappropriate. We're looking for a formal, spiritual expression.
    scene: A young monk reflecting on the teachings of his Zen master.
    register: formal
    setting: religious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「禅 の 公案 が {ごとし}」 makes a direct and specific comparison, implying the words held a similar
      depth, enigmatic quality, and purpose to a Zen koan, designed to provoke spiritual insight. The
      「が」 emphasizes this direct resemblance. The young male monk uses formal language in his reflection,
      appropriate for discussing spiritual matters.
    etymology: A 「公案 (koan)」 in Zen Buddhism is a story, dialogue, question, or statement used to provoke
      the 'great doubt' and test a student's progress in Zen. The comparison with 「がごとし」 highlights the
      profound, sometimes paradoxical, nature of the master's words, drawing on established spiritual
      terminology.
  - english: The politician's speech was full of empty words, like soap bubbles.

          - 政治 家 の 演説 は 石鹸 の 泡 の {よう に}、中身 の ない 言葉 ばかり だっ た
        english: The politician's speech was full of empty words, like soap bubbles.
        hint: To convey the speaker's disdain and the transient, unsubstantial nature of the speech, the
          critical and formal comparison of 「がごとし」 is used, emphasizing the emptiness more sharply than
          the neutral 「よう に」. We're looking for a critical, formal comparison.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 政治 家 の 演説 は 石鹸 の 泡 {みたい に}、中身 の ない 言葉 ばかり だっ た
        english: The politician's speech was full of empty words, like soap bubbles.
        hint: The critical and somewhat formal tone of the analysis makes the casual 「みたい に」 unsuitable
          for conveying the intended judgment. We're looking for a formal, critical expression.
    scene: A journalist commenting on a politician's insubstantial rhetoric after a press conference.
    register: formal
    setting: sarcastic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「石鹸 の 泡 が {ごとし}」 metaphorically equates the politician's words to soap bubbles—attractive
      on the surface but ultimately hollow and ephemeral. The use of 「がごとし」 here adds a critical, almost
      dismissive, nuance to the comparison, suitable for a formal critique. The female journalist uses
      this expression to convey her professional assessment.
    etymology: The comparison of empty words to 「石鹸 の 泡」 (soap bubbles) is a common rhetorical device
      across languages, symbolizing something that appears impressive but lacks substance and vanishes
      quickly. The classical tone of 「がごとし」 intensifies this critical metaphor.
  - english: Those ancient castle walls are truly like the history of the past itself.
    japanese:
      - その 古き 城壁 は まさに 過去 の 歴史 の {如し}。

          - その 古い 城壁 は まさに 過去 の 歴史 の {よう だ}。
        english: Those old castle walls are truly like the history of the past.
        hint: While 「ようだ」 expresses similarity, 「如し」 provides a much more formal and literary tone, emphasizing
          an embodiment rather than just a resemblance. We're looking for an archaic, profound way to
          state this.
    scene: A historian is describing a very old castle to a group of students, emphasizing how much history
      the walls embody.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「歴史の如し」 places emphasis on the castle walls being the embodiment of history, not just resembling
      it. The formality of this sentence style is due to the choice of 「如し」 itself, making the statement
      more refined.
    etymology: The term 「古き」 (furuki) is the attributive form of the classical adjective 「古し」 (furushi),
      meaning 'old'. This form is typically found in literary or archaic contexts, fitting the formal
      register of the sentence. Its use here reinforces the sense of history and age associated with the
      castle walls. The particle 「まさに」 (masani) intensifies the statement, emphasizing the 'truly' or
      'exactly' aspect of the comparison, which adds to the formal and declarative tone of the sentence.

    japanese:

          - 彼 の 目 は 宝石 の {よう な} 輝き を 放っ て い た。
        english: His eyes emitted a brilliance like that of jewels.
        hint: 「のような」 is the modern equivalent for expressing similarity. However, 「如き」 is preferred for
          a more literary, classical, or poetic description, elevating the imagery.
    scene: A fantasy novelist describes a character's striking features to convey their exceptional nature.
    register: bungo (literary)
    setting: creative
    nuance: 「宝石の如き輝き」 creates a strong, almost dazzling image, signifying not just a resemblance but an
      inherent quality. The literary register enhances the descriptive power of the comparison.
    etymology: The verb 「放つ」 (hanatsu), meaning 'to emit' or 'to release', is often used in literary contexts
      to describe the emanation of light, energy, or strong emotions. Its choice here enhances the vivid,
      almost magical description of the character's eyes, fitting the fantasy novel setting. The expression
      「輝きを放つ」 creates a more dynamic and evocative image than a simple noun-verb combination.
  - english: She rushed off the stage as if flying.
    japanese:

          - 彼女 は 飛ぶ {よう に} 舞台 から 駆け去っ た。
        english: She rushed off the stage as if flying.
        hint: 「ように」 is the common modern way to express 'as if' or 'like'. To achieve a more dramatic,
          formal, or literary effect, a different construction is needed.
    scene: A theater critic is recounting a dramatic exit during a play, using heightened language to
      convey the impact.
    register: formal
    setting: creative
    nuance: 「飛ぶが如く」 functions adverbially, intensifying the verb 「駆け去った」 (rushed off), emphasizing the
      speed and grace of her departure. This conveys a sense of powerful, almost unreal movement, typical
      in dramatic narratives.
    etymology: The verb 「駆け去る」 (kakesaru), meaning 'to run away' or 'to rush off', is a compound verb
      combining 「駆ける」 (kakeru, 'to run, to gallop') and 「去る」 (saru, 'to leave, to pass'). This combination
      expresses a swift and decisive departure, enhancing the dramatic impact of the scene. The use of
      「舞台から」 clearly indicates the place of departure, which is essential for visualizing the scene.

        english: The soldiers on the battlefield charged into the enemy lines like fierce demons.
        hint: 「のように」 expresses similarity in a neutral tone. We need a more impactful and literary expression
          for a dramatic war description.
    scene: A historical war correspondent is describing a particularly intense and chaotic battle, using
      vivid, almost mythological imagery.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「鬼神の如く」 describes the soldiers' action with mythical intensity, implying a brutal, unstoppable
      force. This literary choice enhances the vividness of the battle scene.
    etymology: 「鬼神」 (kishin) is a compound noun formed from 「鬼」 (oni, 'demon, ogre') and 「神」 (kami, 'god,
      spirit'). Together, it refers to a fierce, powerful deity or a demonic god. Its use here evokes
      a sense of terrifying strength and supernatural ferocity, which is fitting for a dramatic war description.
      The verb 「突進する」 (tosshin suru, 'to charge, to dash forward') is a formal and impactful term for
      an aggressive forward movement, further emphasizing the intensity of the scene.

        english: The wise sage of old taught that life is like a journey.
        hint: 「ようだ」 is used for general resemblance. For a philosophical statement or proverb from a wise
          sage, a more classical and profound expression is more suitable.
    scene: A philosopher is quoting an ancient saying to illustrate a point about the human experience.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「旅の如し」 uses the terminal form as a timeless metaphorical statement. This use is often found
      in proverbs or philosophical declarations, lending a profound and universal quality to the meaning.
    etymology: The verb 「説く」 (toku) means 'to preach, to explain, to advocate'. It implies a profound
      teaching or a philosophical discourse, rather than a casual explanation. Its usage here is appropriate
      for a 'wise sage' imparting wisdom. The phrase 「昔の賢者」 (mukashi no kenja, 'wise sage of old') establishes
      a timeless and authoritative source for the profound statement about life.
  - english: That incident was truly like a nightmare.
    japanese:

        english: That incident was truly like a nightmare.
        hint: 「のような」 would express similarity but lacks the intensity and formality required to convey
          the full emotional weight of a traumatic event in this context. We're looking for a more formal
          and impactful expression.
    scene: A person, still shaken, describes a traumatic event to a therapist, emphasizing its unreal
      and terrifying nature with elevated language.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「悪夢の如き」 highlights the overwhelming and terrifying nature of the incident, equating it to
      a nightmare in its essence, not just appearance. The formality emphasizes the gravity of the experience.
    etymology: The noun 「出来事」 (dekigoto) refers to an 'incident' or 'event'. It often implies something
      significant or noteworthy that has occurred. The noun 「悪夢」 (akumu) literally means 'bad dream' or
      'nightmare'. The combination 「悪夢の如きもの」 vividly conveys the traumatic and unsettling nature of the
      event, indicating it was so terrible as to be indistinguishable from a nightmare. The expression
      「まさに」 (masani) here emphasizes the 'truly' or 'exactly' quality of the resemblance.

          poetic and profound level, suggesting an almost divine quality rather than a mere comparison.
    scene: A music critic describes a captivating vocal performance, aiming for a poetic and profound
      appreciation of the artist's talent.
    register: formal
    setting: creative
    nuance: 「天使の如く」 modifies 「響き渡った」, implying an almost divine quality to the voice. This adverbial usage
      elevates the description, conveying an extraordinary impact.
    etymology: The verb 「響き渡る」 (hibikiwataru) is a compound verb combining 「響く」 (hibiku, 'to resound,
      to echo') and 「渡る」 (wataru, 'to cross, to extend across'). This compound vividly describes a sound
      that spreads widely and powerfully, reaching everywhere, including deeply into one's heart. Its
      use here magnifies the impact of the singing voice.

      imagery.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「春の日差しの如き暖かさ」 compares the smile to spring sunshine, emphasizing its gentle and welcoming
      nature. The use of 「如き」 adds a poetic and somewhat elevated tone, suitable for intimate romantic
      expression.
    etymology: The noun 「微笑み」 (hohoemi) means 'smile'. It is often used in literary or poetic contexts
      to convey a soft, gentle, or subtle smile, distinct from the more general 「笑顔」 (egao, 'smiling face').
      The noun 「日差し」 (hizashi) refers to 'sunlight' or 'sunbeams'. The combination 「春の日差し」 evokes a sense
      of gentle warmth and renewal, common imagery in romantic literature, reinforcing the poetic tone
      of the example.

          and epic feel, befitting a story about enduring friendship overcoming great hardships.
    scene: A narrator describes an enduring bond between two characters in an epic story, highlighting
      its unbreakable strength.
    register: formal
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: 「岩の如く」 describes the firmness of the friendship, implying unyielding strength and resilience.
      This adverbial expression elevates the description, making the bond sound legendary.
    etymology: The verb 「乗り越える」 (norikoeru) is a compound verb meaning 'to overcome' or 'to get over'.
      It combines 「乗る」 (noru, 'to ride, to get on') and 「越える」 (koeru, 'to cross, to surmount'). This conveys
      the imagery of literally 'crossing over' an obstacle, which is powerful for expressing triumph over
      difficulties. The term 「困難」 (konnan) means 'difficulty' or 'hardship'. The phrase 「どんな困難も」 emphasizes
      'any and all hardships', highlighting the absolute strength of the friendship.

        english: This old clock tower is like the hustle and bustle of the old town.
        hint: 「ようだ」 is a common modern equivalent, but 「如し」 provides a more evocative, poetic, and reflective
          tone, suitable for an older person reminiscing about the past.
    scene: An elderly resident, standing in a quiet, modern town square, reflects on the vibrant past
      for a documentary interview.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「賑わいの如し」 in the terminal form implies that the clock tower *is* the essence of the old town's
      hustle, embodying its spirit. The older speaker's use of this formal, almost poetic phrasing enhances
      the nostalgic and reflective mood.
    etymology: The noun 「時計台」 (tokeidai) literally means 'clock stand' or 'clock tower'. It is a common
      architectural feature in many towns and cities, often serving as a landmark. The noun 「賑わい」 (nigiyaka)
      means 'bustle, prosperity, 'liveliness'. Its use evokes a sense of past vibrancy and activity, fitting
      the nostalgic context of the sentence. The phrase 「昔の街」 (mukashi no machi, 'old town') directly
      sets the scene in a bygone era, emphasizing the reflective and historical tone.
post_example_writeup: The forms 「如く」 (gotoku), 「如き」 (gotoki), and 「如し」 (gotoshi) serve distinct grammatical
  roles. 「如し」 acts as a predicate, typically concluding a sentence or clause, emphasizing the state of
  being 'like' something. 「如き」 functions as an attributive, modifying a noun directly, meaning 'such as'
  or 'like'. 「如く」 serves adverbially, describing how an action is performed, meaning 'as if' or 'in the
  manner of'.
