        "usage-context": "Formal and written contexts, often used in analyses, reports, or literary works.",
        "function": "To express that multiple factors synergistically combine to achieve a particular outcome.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes the mutual reliance and cooperative interaction of elements, where the combined effect is greater than the sum of its parts. The desired outcome emerges from this convergence."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「相まって」 comes from the combination of 「相 (あい)」, meaning \"mutual\" or \"reciprocal\", and the te-form of the verb 「俟つ (まつ)」, which means \"to wait on\" (though it's a less common \"wait\" than 「待つ」). The nuance is that the result happens because these things come together and depend on each other.",
    "writeup": "「相まって」 (aimatte) is a formal Japanese expression used to describe how two or more distinct factors or elements interact synergistically to produce a specific outcome or effect. It strongly emphasizes that the result is a direct consequence of their combined influence, often implying a greater, more profound, or more complex outcome than either factor could achieve independently. This phrase is commonly encountered in written contexts such as academic papers, news articles, literary works, and formal speeches, making it a valuable tool for expressing nuanced cause-and-effect relationships.The core nuance conveyed by 「相まって」 is one of mutual reliance and interdependence. It suggests that the interacting elements do not merely coexist but actively work in concert, with each contributing to and influencing the other, leading to a converged result. The final outcome materializes *after* this dynamic combination. For instance, if factor A and factor B 「相まって」 produce outcome C, it means C emerges precisely from the active, cooperative interplay between A and B, rather than A or B acting in isolation.Historically, 「相まって」 is derived from the combination of 「相 (あい)」, meaning \"mutual\" or \"reciprocal,\" and the te-form of the verb 「俟つ (まつ)」. While 「俟つ」 shares the same pronunciation as the more common 「待つ」 (to wait for), 「俟つ」 carries the nuance of \"to wait on\" or \"to rely on.\" This etymological root illuminates the phrase's underlying meaning: the elements mutually rely on each other, and the desired outcome waits for their combined action. Due to the relative obscurity of the kanji 「俟つ」 in modern usage, 「相まって」 is almost exclusively written in hiragana in contemporary Japanese.",

            "term": "により",
            "meaning": "by means of, due to",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「相まって」, 「により」 focuses on the means or direct cause of an outcome, without the strong implication of mutual interaction or synergistic combination."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "While 「組み合わさって」 also means 'combined', it is a more general term and does not carry the strong nuance of mutual reliance and a specifically enhanced, synergistic outcome that 「相まって」 does. It's less formal and less emphatic about the interactive nature of the combination."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「のおかげで」 implies a positive outcome directly attributable to a factor, often with a sense of gratitude or benefit. 「相まって」 is neutral regarding the positive/negative nature of the outcome and emphasizes the active, interdependent interaction of elements, not just a beneficial cause."

            "meaning": "because of, for the sake of",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「のために」 indicates a direct cause or purpose. It lacks the synergistic aspect of 「相まって」, which highlights how multiple factors interact to create a combined effect, rather than just stating a reason for an outcome."

            "nuance": "「結び付いて」 implies a connection or linkage between elements. However, it does not necessarily convey the deeper, active, and interdependent combination that leads to a greater, emergent outcome, as implied by 「相まって」."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「融合して」 suggests a complete blending or merging of elements into a single entity, often losing their individual distinctness. 「相まって」 can imply factors retaining their distinct identities while interacting to produce a combined effect, without necessarily becoming one."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing 「相まって」 from similar expressions, remember its core nuance of synergy and mutual dependence. While phrases like 「組み合わさって」 (combined) or 「融合して」 (fused) also describe combination, 「相まって」 specifically emphasizes that the individual factors actively contribute to and enhance each other's effects, resulting in an outcome that is greater than the sum of its parts. Other causal expressions like 「により」, 「のおかげで」, or 「のために」 simply state a cause-and-effect relationship, without the focus on the interactive and compounding nature of the elements. Choose 「相まって」 when you want to highlight that the factors are not just coincidental or additive, but fundamentally interdependent in producing the given result.",
