        "usage-context": "Keigo",
        "function": "To express that multiple factors synergistically combine to achieve a particular outcome.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes the mutual reliance and cooperative interaction of elements, where the combined effect is greater than the sum of its parts. The desired outcome emerges from this convergence."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「相まって」 comes from the combination of 「相 (あい)」, meaning \"mutual\" or \"reciprocal\", and the te-form of the verb 「俟つ (まつ)」, which means \"to wait on\" (though it's a less common \"wait\" than 「待つ」). The nuance is that the result happens *because* these things come together and depend on each other.",
    "writeup": "「相まって」 (aimatte) is a formal expression used to indicate that two or more factors or elements combine or interact synergistically to produce a particular result or effect. It emphasizes that the outcome is a product of their combined influence, often implying a greater or more significant result than either factor could achieve on its own. This phrase is particularly common in written Japanese, such as in articles or novels, and in formal speech. The nuance conveyed is one of mutual reliance or interdependence, where the elements come together and work in concert, with the primary outcome happening *after* their combination. For instance, if A and B 「相まって」 produce C, it means C arises from the active, cooperative interplay of A and B. While etymologically connected to the verb 俟つ (まつ) meaning 'to wait on' or 'to rely on,' this kanji is now rarely used, and `相まって` is almost exclusively written in hiragana in modern Japanese.",
