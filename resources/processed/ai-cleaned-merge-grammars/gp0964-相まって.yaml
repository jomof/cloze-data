    "etymology": "The term 「相まって」 comes from 「相(あい)」 meaning 'mutual' or 'reciprocal,' combined with the て-form of the verb 「俟(ま)つ」, which means 'to wait on' or 'to rely on.' This indicates a sense of mutual dependence or interaction leading to a particular outcome.",
    "writeup": "「相まって」 is a formal structure used to express that two or more factors combine to produce a synergistic effect or result. Often, either factor alone could contribute to the result, but their combination enhances it. It conveys a sense of mutual influence or dependence. The structure typically involves listing the contributing factors (A and B) before 「相まって」, often using the particles 「と」 or 「が」 to connect the nouns. A common translation is \"(A) combined with (B) will (C).\" 「相まって」 is often used in formal writing or speech and is considered part of 「敬語(けいご)」 (keigo) or polite language.",
