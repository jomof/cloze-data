    "etymology": "The particle 「つ」 originates from the classical Japanese particle 「つ」, which served as a conjunction or a possessive particle. In this grammar point, it connects verbs to indicate repeated, alternating actions.",
    "writeup": "The 「つ〜つ」 structure highlights **contrasting verbs**, often translated as \"to be doing (A) and (B) over and over,\" where actions happen repeatedly in sequence. 「つ」 connects to the conjunctive form of verbs, with (A) and (B) usually in direct order. It is also common to see the same verb repeated, with the (A) verb in standard form and the (B) verb in passive form, translating as \"to do (A) and to have (A) done to oneself.\" This grammar pattern is used with a limited set of words. Some standard combinations include:\n\n*   行きつ戻りつ - To go back and forth.\n*   浮きつ沈みつ - To surface and submerge (to bob).\n*   見えつ隠れつ - To go in and out of sight.\n*   とつおいつ (from 取りつ置きつ) - To waver between.\n*   矯めつ眇めつ - To take a good look.\n*   組んず解れつ - To intertwine and release (to grapple).\n*   抜きつ抜かれつ - To pull away and be pulled away from (to be neck and neck).\n*   持ちつ持たれつ - To have and to be held (to give and take).\n*   押しつ押されつ - To press and be pressed.\n*   追いつ追われつ - To overtake and be overtaken.\n*   差しつ差されつ - To pour and be poured (to take turns exchanging drinks).",

            "nuance": "「～たり～たりする」 is a general pattern for listing alternating or various actions. In contrast, 「つ〜つ」 is a more archaic and fixed expression that specifically emphasizes continuous, repetitive, and often contrasting movements or states."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「助け合う」 simply means to mutually help. 「持ちつ持たれつ」, while implying mutual help, specifically emphasizes a give-and-take relationship where there is shared support and reliance, often implying shared burdens or benefits beyond simple assistance."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「～たり～たりする」 can express alternating actions, 「つ〜つ」 is a more traditional and idiomatic expression often used for specific contrasting pairs of verbs, conveying a sense of continuous or repetitive movement. 「助け合う」 broadly means to help each other, but 「持ちつ持たれつ」 carries the specific nuance of a reciprocal, interdependent relationship.",

            "nuance": "The phrase 「不安げに」 (anxiously) combined with 「{行きつ戻りつ} して いた」 effectively portrays the speaker's nervous pacing, which is often an indicator of internal turmoil. The use of plain past tense 「して いた」 fits a casual, observational tone.",
            "etymology": "「行きつ戻りつ」 is a classic idiom describing continuous back-and-forth movement. The use of 「つ」 as a conjunction here emphasizes the repetitive and alternating nature of the actions, creating a vivid image of constant motion or indecision."

            "etymology": "「持ちつ持たれつ」 literally means \"holding and being held,\" stemming from the verbs 「持つ」 (to hold, to have) and 「持たれる」 (to be held, to be supported). This idiom vividly captures the essence of mutual support and interdependence."

            "etymology": "「見えつ隠れつ」 combines 「見える」 (to be visible) and 「隠れる」 (to hide), illustrating something repeatedly coming into and out of sight. The 'つ' conjunction emphasizes this continuous, alternating process."

            "etymology": "「抜きつ抜かれつ」 is formed from 「抜く」 (to overtake, to pull ahead) and 「抜かれる」 (to be overtaken). The repeated 「つ」 signifies a continuous, intense alternation of actions, common in descriptions of close races or contests."
