    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 is used to indicate the direction or destination of movement. It essentially means \"to\" or \"toward.\" It's a fundamental particle, crucial for expressing motion in Japanese. It pinpoints the endpoint of an action or the place something is directed towards. This particle indicates the target destination of movement. Consider the sentence 「東京{に}行きます」 (Tokyo {ni} ikimasu), meaning \"I go {to} Tokyo.\"",
