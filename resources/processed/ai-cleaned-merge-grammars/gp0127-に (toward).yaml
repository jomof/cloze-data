        "usage-context": "Used to mark the destination or target of a verb of movement (e.g., 行く, 来る, 帰る), existence (e.g., ある, いる), or action that results in a state/location (e.g., 座る, 置く). Also used for indirect objects of verbs like あげる (to give) or 貸す (to lend), and for specific points in time.",
        "function": "Indicates direction, destination, location of existence, recipient, or point in time.",
        "nuance": "While often translated as 'to' or 'toward,' に is more precise, often pinpointing the exact point of arrival, contact, or the specific target of an action or state. It's less about the path and more about the final spot or recipient.",

        "temporal-flow": "Marks a specific moment or interval for temporal actions.",
        "spatial-flow": "Indicates a specific destination or location of an entity or action."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 originates from the verb 「あり」 (ari), meaning \"to exist\" or \"to be.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate the location where something exists or the direction toward which something moves, eventually broadening to denote various targets and points in time.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 is a fundamental and versatile particle in Japanese, primarily used to indicate the **destination or target** of an action, movement, or state. It functions to pinpoint the precise arrival point for verbs of motion such as 行く (iku - to go), 来る (kuru - to come), and 帰る (kaeru - to return). For example, 「学校{に}行く」 (gakkou ni iku) means \"to go to school.\"\n\nBeyond movement, 「に」 also marks the **indirect object** of a verb, indicating the recipient of an action, as in 「友達{に}手紙を書く」 (tomodachi ni tegami o kaku - to write a letter to a friend). It can also denote a **specific point in time** when an event occurs, such as 「三時{に}会う」 (sanji ni au - to meet at three o'clock).\n\nFurthermore, 「に」 is used to specify the **location of existence** for inanimate objects with ある (aru) or animate beings with いる (iru), but only when introducing the existence of something, as in 「机の上{に}本がある」 (tsukue no ue ni hon ga aru - There is a book on the desk). It also marks the **point of contact** for verbs like 座る (suwaru - to sit) or 置く (oku - to put), indicating where something lands or is placed.\n\nIts wide range of uses stems from its historical evolution from a verb meaning \"to exist,\" emphasizing the location or target where something exists or comes to be.",
