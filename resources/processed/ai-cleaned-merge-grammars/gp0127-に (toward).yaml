  part-of-speech: particle
  register: teineigo (polite)
  particle-syntactic-function: directional
  usage-context: Used to mark the destination or target of a verb of movement (e.g., 行く, 来る, 帰る), existence
    (e.g., ある, いる), or action that results in a state/location (e.g., 座る, 置く). Also used for indirect
    objects of verbs like あげる (to give) or 貸す (to lend), for specific points in time, and to mark the
    agent in passive and causative-passive constructions.
  function: Indicates direction, destination, location of existence, recipient, point in time, or passive
    agent.
  nuance: While often translated as 'to' or 'toward,' に is more precise, often pinpointing the exact point
    of arrival, contact, or the specific target of an action or state. It's less about the path and more
    about the final spot or recipient.
  grammatical-role: Marks the complement of various verbs.
  temporal-flow: Marks a specific moment or interval for temporal actions.
  spatial-flow: Indicates a specific destination or location of an entity or action.
etymology: The particle 「に」 originates from the verb 「あり」 (ari), meaning "to exist" or "to be." Over time,
  it evolved to indicate the location where something exists or the direction toward which something moves,
  eventually broadening to denote various targets and points in time.
writeup: |-
  The particle 「に」 is a fundamental and versatile particle in Japanese, primarily used to indicate the **destination or target** of an action, movement, or state. It functions to pinpoint the precise arrival point for verbs of motion such as 行く (iku - to go), 来る (kuru - to come), and 帰る (kaeru - to return). For example, 「学校{に}行く」 (gakkou ni iku) means "to go to school."

  Beyond movement, 「に」 also marks the **indirect object** of a verb, indicating the recipient of an action, as in 「友達{に}手紙を書く」 (tomodachi ni tegami o kaku - to write a letter to a friend). It can also denote a **specific point in time** when an event occurs, such as 「三時{に}会う」 (sanji ni au - to meet at three o'clock).

  Furthermore, 「に」 is used to specify the **location of existence** for inanimate objects with ある (aru) or animate beings with いる (iru), but only when introducing the existence of something, as in 「机の上{に}本がある」 (tsukue no ue ni hon ga aru - There is a book on the desk). It also marks the **point of contact** for verbs like 座る (suwaru - to sit) or 置く (oku - to put), indicating where something lands or is placed. Lastly, 「に」 is crucial for identifying the **agent** in passive constructions, showing who performed the action, as in 「先生{に}褒められる」 (sensei ni homerareru - to be praised by the teacher).

  Its wide range of uses stems from its historical evolution from a verb meaning "to exist," emphasizing the location or target where something exists or comes to be.

    meaning: at, in, on (location of action); by means of
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「に」, which specifies the destination, precise location of existence, or target of an
      action, 「で」 indicates the general location *where* an action takes place, or the means/method by
      which an action is performed. For example, 「カフェ {で} 勉強 する」 (kafe de benkyou suru - study *at* a
      cafe) vs. 「カフェ {に} 行く」 (kafe ni iku - go *to* a cafe).
    grammar_point: で (at)
  - term: へ
    meaning: toward; to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「へ」 also indicates direction or a destination, it places more emphasis on the *direction*
      or the *path* taken toward a place rather than the specific arrival point. 「に」, in contrast, emphasizes
      the *arrival* at the destination or the specific target. For example, 「東京 {へ} 向かう」 (Tokyo e mukau
      - to head *toward* Tokyo) vs. 「東京 {に} 着く」 (Tokyo ni tsuku - to arrive *at* Tokyo).
    grammar_point: へ (directional particle)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To differentiate between 「に」 and 「で」, remember that 「に」 often indicates a
  *point* (destination, time, recipient), while 「で」 indicates a *space* where an action happens or a *tool*
  used for an action. For instance, 「公園 {に} 行く」 (kouen ni iku) means "go *to* the park," focusing on the
  destination. 「公園 {で} 遊ぶ」 (kouen de asobu) means "play *in* the park," focusing on the location of the
  activity. When comparing 「に」 and 「へ」, consider the emphasis: 「へ」 is about the journey or general direction,
  whereas 「に」 is about the end point of that journey.'

    scene: A neat person carefully organizing their belongings after reading.
    register: casual

        hint: 「で」 marks the location where an action occurs. In this context, 「に」 specifies the *destination*

      a path. 「出ます」 (demasu) is the polite non-past form of 「出る」 (deru - to come out/exit). The phrasing
      is typical for giving clear, polite directions. 「出る」 is the casual counterpart.

        hint: 「で」 marks the location where an action occurs. When simply stating the existence of an animate

    scene: A person is pointing out a pet to a friend visiting their home.
    register: teineigo (polite)

    nuance: The particle 「に」 indicates the static location where an animate being (猫) exists when used
      with verbs like 「いる」. The choice between 「います」 and 「いる」 depends on the desired politeness level,
      with 「います」 being polite for speaking to non-close individuals and 「いる」 being casual for friends
      and family.

          - ここ で 座っ て ください。
        english: Please sit (action) here.
        hint: While 「で」 indicates the general location where an action takes place, 「に」 is used with verbs
          like 「座る」 (suwaru - to sit) to pinpoint the exact location where the action results in a static
          state. We're looking for the precise point of sitting.
    scene: A host inviting a guest to take a seat in their living room.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: humorous
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: Used with verbs that denote placement or assumption of a position, such as 「座る」 (suwaru -
      to sit), 「に」 specifies the precise location where the action terminates, resulting in a static state.
      「～て ください」 (te kudasai) is a polite form used for making requests, making 「ここに座ってください」 a polite invitation.
  - english: I was praised by my teacher.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 から 褒め られ まし た。
        english: I was praised from my teacher.
        hint: While 「から」 can indicate a source, 「に」 is specifically used to mark the agent of a passive
          verb in Japanese. We're looking for the particle that clearly identifies who performed the action
          in a passive sentence.
    scene: A student proudly tells their parent about a positive school experience.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: In passive voice constructions, 「に」 is used to mark the agent who performs the action, similar
      to 'by' in English. For instance, in 「先生に褒められました」, 「先生に」 indicates that the teacher is the one who
      did the praising. The verb 「褒める」 (homeru - to praise) becomes passive 「褒められる」 (homerareru - to be
      praised), with the past polite form being 「褒められました」 and the casual past form 「褒められた」.
