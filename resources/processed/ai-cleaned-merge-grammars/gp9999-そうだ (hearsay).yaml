jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: Conveys reported information or hearsay without personal judgment or direct observation.
  nuance: Used to relay information heard from others, news, or general knowledge. It implies the speaker
    is repeating information, not asserting it as their own fact. It is distinct from forms that imply
    observation or conjecture, such as そうだ (appearance).
  grammatical-role: Forms an adjectival phrase modifying the preceding clause, indicating reported information.
etymology: The form そうだ (hearsay) is thought to derive from earlier forms of the verb そう (to appear, to
  seem) or from 然う (sou) meaning 'thus' or 'in such a way,' combined with the copula だ. This construction
  evolved to signify that something is 'as said' or 'according to what is heard,' thus conveying reported
  information. It is distinct from そうだ (appearance), which uses a different conjugation pattern and implies
  direct observation.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point そうだ (hearsay) is used to convey information that the speaker has heard from another source, rather than something they have observed directly or know as a fact. It translates roughly to "I heard that..." or "It is said that...".

  This form attaches to the plain form of verbs, i-adjectives, na-adjectives, and nouns. For na-adjectives and nouns, the copula だ can often be omitted, especially in more casual speech. For instance, you might hear 「静かそうです」 instead of 「静かだそうです」, or 「学生そうです」 instead of 「学生だそうです」.

  It is crucial to differentiate this そうだ from the そうだ that indicates appearance or a visual impression (e.g., 「美味しそうだ」 - 'It looks delicious'). The key distinction lies in the form of the preceding word: そうだ (hearsay) attaches to the plain form (e.g., 食べる、美味しい、静かだ、学生だ), while そうだ (appearance) attaches to the verb stem (食べそう), the i-adjective stem (美味しそう), or directly to the na-adjective stem (静かそう) or noun (元気そう).

  This grammar point functions as a neutral way to report information, reflecting that the speaker is simply relaying what they have been told or read, without adding their personal opinion or speculation.
false_friends:
  - term: そうだ (appearance)
    meaning: It looks like; appears to be
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike そうだ (hearsay), そうだ (appearance) is used when the speaker is making a judgment based
      on their direct observation. For example, 「雨が降りそうです」 (It looks like it's going to rain, based on
      observing the sky) versus 「雨が降るそうです」 (I heard it's going to rain, based on a weather report).
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]・[い-Adjective-stem]・[な-Adjective]そうだ (it seems・looks like)'
  - term: らしい
    meaning: It seems; apparently; I hear (based on evidence)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both convey reported information, らしい implies that the speaker has some indirect evidence,
      a strong impression, or a general sense that something is true, but not necessarily a direct report.
      そうだ (hearsay) is a more direct relay of what was explicitly heard or stated.
    grammar_point: らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)
  - term: とのことだ
    meaning: I heard that; according to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: とのことだ is more formal and often used to quote someone or something directly, similar to 「〜と申しております」.
      そうだ (hearsay) is a general report and can be used in a broader range of contexts, both formal and
      casual.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:とのことだ (reported information)
  - term: んだって
    meaning: I heard that (casual)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: んだって is a very casual contraction of のだそうだ or のだと言っていた. It carries the same hearsay meaning
      as そうだ but is significantly more informal and typically used among close friends or in very relaxed
      settings.
    grammar_point: んだって (I heard, casual)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing そうだ (hearsay) with similar expressions, remember that そうだ
  (hearsay) is for directly relaying information heard from a source. そうだ (appearance) is for making a
  judgment based on what you see. らしい suggests indirect evidence or a strong impression. とのことだ is more
  formal and often used for direct quotes. んだって is a casual version of hearsay.
