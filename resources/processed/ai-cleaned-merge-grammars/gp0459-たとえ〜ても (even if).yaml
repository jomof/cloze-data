    "etymology": "「たとえ」 comes from the verb 「例える (tatoeru)」, meaning \"to compare\" or \"to use as an example.\" It sets up a hypothetical situation. 「〜ても」 expresses \"even if\" or \"even though,\" indicating a contrast or concession. Its origin implies setting up a specific instance or example to make a point, which aligns with its use to introduce a hypothetical scenario that does not alter the conclusion.",
    "writeup": "「たとえ〜ても」 is used to express that even if something is the case, it doesn't necessarily affect the outcome. 「たとえ」 introduces a hypothetical situation, and 「〜ても」 indicates that regardless of that situation, the result remains the same or is still possible. It is a contrastive conjunction, meaning that while situation A might lead you to expect Result X, that is not the case; instead, Result Y occurs. The addition of 「たとえ」 to 「〜ても」 adds emphasis to the hypothetical nature of the condition, implying an 'even if this unlikely or difficult thing happens' scenario, making the statement more emphatic than 「〜ても」 alone. Sometimes 「たとい」 is used, especially in older texts or more formal contexts, but 「たとえ」 is overwhelmingly more common in modern Japanese.",
