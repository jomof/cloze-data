    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にかけて」 comes from the verb 「掛ける (kakeru)」, which means \"to hang,\" \"to suspend,\" or \"to extend.\" The 「に」 indicates a direction or starting point, so literally, it suggests something extends 'towards' or 'over' a certain period or area.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「にかけて」 indicates that something occurs or extends over a specific period or range. It is formed by combining the particle 「に」 (indicating a direction or starting point) with the 連用形 (ren'yōkei) of the verb 「掛ける (kakeru)」, which means \"to hang,\" \"to suspend,\" or \"to extend over,\" followed by the connecting particle 「て」. Literally, one can think of 「に」 as marking a location or state, and 「掛けて」 as indicating that something is \"suspended\" or ongoing within that location or state. This expression is primarily used with nouns, typically to describe a continuous period of time (e.g., 'from ~ until ~', 'all through ~') or a geographical spread. It is particularly common in news reports and formal written contexts, such as describing weather patterns expected to continue for a certain duration. While more frequent in written Japanese, it can also be used naturally in conversation.\n\nA notable variation occurs when the adverbial particle 「は」 is added after 「にかけて」, forming 「にかけては」. While 「にかけて」 signifies a period or range, the addition of 「は」 can introduce a nuance of emphasis or limitation. In this context, 「にかけては」 can imply \"limited to within (A)\" or \"as far as (A) is concerned,\" often highlighting a contrasting or specific condition within that period or range. This usage aligns with the broader function of 「は」 to mark a topic or contrast, setting the preceding phrase as a specific point of discussion.",

One is when the emphasizing particle 「は」 is added to 「にかけて」, which indicates a period or range as explained in this section. In this case, it takes on the meaning of 'limited to within that period or range,' used to describe changes or specific situations within a defined timeframe. The other meaning is entirely different, conveying 'as for ~' or 'regarding ~,' which refers to excellence or ability in a particular field. It is crucial to distinguish these two uses to avoid misunderstanding.",
