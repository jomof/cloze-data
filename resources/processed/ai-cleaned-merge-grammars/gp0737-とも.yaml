    "etymology": "The particle 「とも」 can be traced back to Old Japanese, where it functioned as a conjunction indicating accompaniment or simultaneity. Over time, its usage evolved to include concessive meanings, expressing the idea that something is true 'even if' or 'no matter what' the preceding clause states.",
    "writeup": "「とも」 is a particle that can function as a sentence-ending particle, conjunction particle, or adverbial particle. In most cases, the meanings are interchangeable, depending on the word it's grouped with. The common interpretations of 「とも」 in nearly any situation are \"even if (A)\" or \"no matter if (A),\" highlighting that \"in spite of (A), still (B).\"\n\nAs a conjunction particle, 「とも」 is paired with words followed by auxiliary verbs う or よう, or after い-adjectives in their conjunctive form. The adverbial particle usage only appears after い-adjectives in their conjunctive form, and a select number of adverbs. It is recommended not to use this structure after adverbs unless you have seen it used this way in native material.",
