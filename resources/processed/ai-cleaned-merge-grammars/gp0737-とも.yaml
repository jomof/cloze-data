    "writeup": "「とも」 is a particle that can function in various grammatical roles, including as a sentence-ending particle, a conjunction particle, or an adverbial particle. Despite these classifications, its core meaning consistently conveys \"even if (A)\" or \"no matter if (A),\" highlighting that \"in spite of (A), still (B)\". As a conjunction particle, 「とも」 is typically paired with words that precede the auxiliary verbs 「う」 or 「よう」, indicating a volitional form. It can also follow the conjunctive form of い-adjectives (e.g., 忙しくとも). The adverbial particle usage appears after い-adjectives in their conjunctive form (e.g., 早くとも) and occasionally after a select number of adverbs. However, it's advisable to observe its usage in native material before actively employing it with adverbs, as its application in such contexts is less common. This grammar point often appears in formal contexts and is less common in everyday, casual speech.",

We're looking for a grammar that expresses a strong, unwavering commitment to the bond, suggesting a more profound and enduring aspect compared to the more common conditional forms.

It does not suggest that your parents will say something, but rather that it does not matter what they say. 「ても」 allows for the possibility that your parents may say something, whereas 「とも」 removes that possibility of concern from the speaker, no matter what they say.

However, in this specific scenario, a female speaker using this strong, resolute tone signifies a firm and independent decision, which might be particularly notable in contexts where family influence on marriage is traditionally significant. This expression showcases her resolve against potential traditional expectations rather than being a gender-specific linguistic marker. There's nothing in the Japanese that marks the speaker as female, except for the scenario."
