    "etymology": "The particle 「とも」 is thought to be derived from the verb 「共にする(tomoni suru)」, meaning \"to do together\" or \"to share\". Over time, it evolved to express the idea of something happening regardless of other circumstances.",
    "writeup": "「とも」 is a particle that can function in various grammatical roles, including as a sentence-ending particle, a conjunction particle, or an adverbial particle. Despite these classifications, its core meaning consistently conveys \"even if (A)\" or \"no matter if (A),\" highlighting that \"in spite of (A), still (B)\".\n\nAs a conjunction particle, 「とも」 is typically paired with words that precede the auxiliary verbs 「う」 or 「よう」, indicating a volitional form. It can also follow the conjunctive form of い-adjectives (e.g., 忙しくとも). The adverbial particle usage appears after い-adjectives in their conjunctive form (e.g., 早くとも) and occasionally after a select number of adverbs. However, it's advisable to observe its usage in native material before actively employing it with adverbs, as its application in such contexts is less common.",
