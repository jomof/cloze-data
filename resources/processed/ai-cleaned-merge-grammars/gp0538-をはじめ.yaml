    "etymology": "The grammar point 「をはじめ」 comes from the verb 「始める」(hajimeru), meaning \"to begin\" or \"to start.\" The particle 「を」 marks the object, in this case, the starting point. So, literally, it means \"beginning with.\" ",
    "writeup": "The expression 「をはじめ」 is used to present a topic or example as a starting point, often implying that there are other related items or topics. It can be translated as \"not only (A), but also (B)\" or \"starting with (A), (B).\" The structure emphasizes (A) as the initial element, and it's frequently paired with expressions like 「として」 to further highlight the starting point. It is considered standard Japanese.",
