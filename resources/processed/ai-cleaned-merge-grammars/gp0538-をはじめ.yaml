    "etymology": "「始め (hajime)」 means \"beginning\" or \"start.\" The particle 「を (o)」 marks the noun as the object of the implied verb, indicating that something is starting with that noun.",
    "writeup": "「をはじめ」 is used to present a topic or example as a \"starting point,\" often implying a logical progression from that point. It can be translated as \"not only (A), but (B)\" or \"starting with (A), (B)\". It highlights one noun as the initial example before introducing others. It emphasizes (A) as the starting point. Expressions like 「として」 may be paired to further emphasize (A), similar to \"with (A) as the starting point, (B)\". This grammar point is commonly used in both written and formal spoken Japanese.",
