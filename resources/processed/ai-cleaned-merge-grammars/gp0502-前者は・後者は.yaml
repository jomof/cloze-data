    "etymology": "「前者 (zensha)」literally means \"the previous one\" or \"the preceding item,\" formed from 「前 (zen)」 meaning \"before\" or \"previous,\" and 「者 (sha)」, meaning \"person\" or \"thing.\" 「後者 (kōsha)」 means \"the latter one\" or \"the following item,\" constructed from 「後 (kō)」 meaning \"after\" or \"later,\" and 「者 (sha)」.",
    "writeup": "「前者は (zensha wa)」and 「後者は (kōsha wa)」are used to compare two items, ideas, or people that have already been mentioned. They function almost exactly like \"the former\" and \"the latter\" in English.\n\n*   **「前者は」** refers to the first item, idea, or person mentioned.\n*   **「後者は」** refers to the second item, idea, or person mentioned.\n\nThese phrases appear at the beginning of their respective statements and are followed by the particle 「は」 to indicate the topic of the sentence. It is **important** that there is a clear relationship or basis for comparison between the two things being discussed for these terms to be used naturally. They are generally used in formal or semi-formal contexts when a clear and structured comparison is required.",
