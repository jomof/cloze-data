    "etymology": "The verb 「直(なお)す」 itself means \"to fix\" or \"to correct.\" When used as a suffix, it carries the nuance of redoing something to make it right or better. The kanji 「直」 literally means \"straight\" or \"direct,\" implying the action of straightening something out or correcting it.",
    "writeup": "「直(なお)す」 is a verb meaning \"to fix\" or \"to correct\". As a grammar point, it's attached to the ます-stem of another verb to indicate that something needs to be redone, usually because the first attempt was unsatisfactory. It implies an effort to improve or correct a previous action.  For する verbs, する becomes し, and then 「直(なお)す」 is added. For example, 勉強する becomes 勉強し直す.  In very casual speech, する can be replaced with やる, becoming やり直す.",
