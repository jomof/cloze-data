    "etymology": "There are several theories regarding the origin of 折角(せっかく). One common explanation suggests it's an abbreviation of 頭巾の角を折る (zukin no kado o oru), meaning \"to fold the corner of a hood.\" This refers to a Confucian scholar who intentionally folded the corner of his hood to prevent it from getting wet. People emulated this act, and 折角 came to mean \"intentionally\" or \"going out of one's way.\"",
    "writeup": "折角(せっかく) is an idiomatic adverb often used to express doing something \"with trouble,\" \"at great pains,\" or indicating a \"rare/long-awaited occasion.\" As an adverb that modifies the meaning of a whole sentence, it commonly appears at the beginning of a statement. When 折角 nominates an event as being long-awaited, it appears directly before the event, separated only by the case marking particle の. Think of it as something you really anticipated or put significant effort into. It expresses a sense of disappointment or regret when the expected outcome doesn't materialize.",
