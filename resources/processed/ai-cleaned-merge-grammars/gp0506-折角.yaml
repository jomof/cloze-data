    "etymology": "There are several theories about the origin of 折角 (せっかく). One common explanation is that it's an abbreviation of 頭巾 の 角 を 折る (ずきん の つの を おる), meaning \"to fold the corner of a hood.\" This refers to a Confucian scholar who would intentionally fold his hood to keep it from getting wet. People began imitating him, and 折角 came to mean 'intentionally' or 'to go out of one's way'. This historical usage illustrates the core meaning of putting in conscious effort or going out of one's way for a specific purpose.",
    "writeup": "**折角 (せっかく)** is an idiomatic adverb used to convey that something was done \"with trouble,\" \"at great pains,\" or that it marks \"a rare or long-awaited occasion.\" When it is used to express the effort put into something, it often implies a sense of disappointment if that effort goes to waste or if the outcome is negative. It can also be used positively to encourage making the most of a special opportunity, almost like saying \"since we've gone this far, we might as well...\" or \"it would be a shame not to...\".\n\nWhen **折角** emphasizes an event as being long-awaited or special, it typically appears directly before the event, followed by the particle の, forming **折角の + noun**.\n\nWhile generally used in standard conversation, the specific nuance can shift depending on context and particle usage. For example, ending a sentence with `折角だ` can convey a sense of regret or a proactive suggestion.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene highlights the mother's desire for the *appreciation* of her effort and the value of the outcome, rather than just the difficulty of the task. {折角} conveys this sense of 'it would be a waste if you didn't appreciate the effort,' steering away from a simple 'it was hard'."

For instance, you would use {折角} when talking about wasted effort, as in 「{折角} 作った 料理 が 冷めて しまった」 (The food I went to the trouble of making got cold). On the other hand, わざわざ highlights the *purposeful* and sometimes *unnecessary* nature of an action, such as 「わざわざ 遠く から 来て くれた」 (They specifically came all the way from far away). Choose {折角} when emphasizing the preciousness of an opportunity or the significant effort invested, particularly when there's a risk of it being squandered. Use わざわざ when highlighting the deliberate act of going out of one's way.",
