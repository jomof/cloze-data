    "etymology": "There are several theories about the origin of 折角 (せっかく). One common explanation is that it's an abbreviation of 頭巾の角を折る (ずきんのつのをおる), meaning \"to fold the corner of a hood.\" This refers to a Confucian scholar who would intentionally fold his hood to keep it from getting wet. People began imitating him, and 折角 came to mean 'intentionally' or 'to go out of one's way'. This historical usage illustrates the core meaning of putting in conscious effort or going out of one's way for a specific purpose.",
    "writeup": "**折角 (せっかく)** is an idiomatic adverb used to convey that something was done \"with trouble,\" \"at great pains,\" or that it marks \"a rare or long-awaited occasion.\" When it is used to express the effort put into something, it often implies a sense of disappointment if that effort goes to waste or if the outcome is negative. It can also be used positively to encourage making the most of a special opportunity, almost like saying \"since we've gone this far, we might as well...\" or \"it would be a shame not to...\".\n\nWhen **折角** emphasizes an event as being long-awaited or special, it typically appears directly before the event, followed by the particle の, forming **折角の + noun**. This form highlights the preciousness or unique quality of the occasion, often implying that it should not be wasted.\n\nWhile generally used in standard conversation, the specific nuance can shift depending on context and particle usage. For example, ending a sentence with `折角だ` can convey a sense of regret or a proactive suggestion.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes the value of the effort and the disappointment of the wasted effort, which {折角} captures more strongly than a simple 'it was hard'."

                    "mitigation": "The scene highlights the unique and special nature of the trip, emphasizing it as an uncommon and anticipated event. {折角} の captures this sense of 'rare opportunity' more effectively than just stating it was 'looked forward to'."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 折角 and わざわざ both relate to effort, it's important to remember their differing nuances. 折角 often carries an emotional undertone of value, appreciation, or regret concerning the effort or occasion. For instance, you would use 折角 when talking about wasted effort, as in 「折角作った料理が冷めてしまった」 (The food I went to the trouble of making got cold). On the other hand, わざわざ highlights the purposeful and sometimes unnecessary nature of an action, such as 「わざわざ遠くから来てくれた」 (They specifically came all the way from far away). Choose 折角 when emphasizing the preciousness of an opportunity or the significant effort invested, particularly when there's a risk of it being squandered. Use わざわざ when highlighting the deliberate act of going out of one's way.",
