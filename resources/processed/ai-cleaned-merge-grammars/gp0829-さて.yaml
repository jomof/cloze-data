    "etymology": "The origin of 「さて」 is somewhat debated, but it's believed to be derived from the verb 「然る (しかる)」, meaning \"to be that way\" or \"to be so.\" Over time, it evolved into an interjection used to mark a transition in thought or action.",
    "writeup": "「さて」 functions as a conjunction, signaling a change in topic or a shift to a new point. It's akin to saying \"well,\" \"well then,\" or \"now\" in English. 「さて」 typically appears at the beginning of a sentence, setting the stage for the speaker to introduce a fresh subject or course of action. While rarely written in kanji, you might occasionally encounter 「扨」 or 「偖」, both carrying the sense of \"now\" as a starting point.",
