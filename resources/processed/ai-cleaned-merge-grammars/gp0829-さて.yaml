    "etymology": "The etymology of 「さて」 is uncertain, but it is thought to have originated from the verb 「然る (しかる)」, meaning \"to be so\" or \"to be like that.\" Over time, it evolved into an interjection used to mark a shift in thought or conversation.",
    "writeup": "「さて」 functions as a conjunction, signaling a shift in topic or a move to a new point. It's akin to saying \"well\" or \"well then\" in English. It always appears at the beginning of a sentence, setting the stage for what's to come. While rarely written in kanji, you might occasionally see 「扨」 or 「偖」.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「さて」, 「さ」, and 「では」 can all be translated as \"well\" or \"now,\" 「さて」 is generally used to introduce a new topic or activity with a sense of deliberate transition or contemplation. 「さ」 often implies encouragement or uncertainty, and 「では」 indicates a logical consequence or transition based on what was previously said.",
