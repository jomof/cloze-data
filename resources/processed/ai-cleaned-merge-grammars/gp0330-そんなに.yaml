    "etymology": "そんなに is derived from the demonstrative adjective そんな (like that) combined with the particle に (to/in/at). The addition of に emphasizes the degree or extent to which something resembles or is similar to something else.",
    "writeup": "そんなに, like そんな, is a common way to express that something is \"like\" something else in casual conversation. The addition of the particle に highlights そんな as being the \"destination\" of the \"like\" amount. This construction is regularly translated as \"so much\", \"that much\", or simply \"like that\". As a word, そんなに is used adverbially, so it may come before any verb, い-Adjective, or な-Adjective.\n\nLiterally, a sentence based on そんなに can be translated as \"to an extent like (A),\" where (A) is the word that comes after そんなに, and に indicates \"to\".\n\nAs そんなに is an example of こそあど言葉 (words like これ, それ, あれ, and どれ), this means that こんなに, あんなに, and どんなに may also be used. Despite this, そんなに is almost considered a set phrase, and is therefore the most common out of all of the possibilities (except for どんなに, which is often used when explaining/giving reasons for something).",
