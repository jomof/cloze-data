        "usage-context": "General use",
        "function": "To express a strong, often exaggerated, comparison or resemblance.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes the completeness or intensity of the resemblance. Often used for dramatic effect or to convey a surprising similarity."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「まるで」 means \"completely\" or \"entirely\". 「ようだ」 means \"like\" or \"similar to\". The combination creates the nuance of something seeming **exactly** like something else.",
    "writeup": "「まるで…ようだ」 is a powerful expression used to convey a strong, often exaggerated, comparison or resemblance. It combines the adverb 「まるで」 (meaning \"entirely\" or \"completely,\" sometimes written as 「丸で」) with the auxiliary adjective 「ようだ」 (meaning \"as if\" or \"as though\"). This combination creates a sense of almost identical similarity.\n\n「まるで」 is placed at the beginning of the sentence or clause, preceding the description of what the subject seems to be like. The core nuance of \"as if\" or \"as though\" primarily comes from 「ようだ」 or its more casual counterpart, 「みたいだ」. 「まるで」 serves to intensify this comparison, emphasizing that the resemblance is **complete** or **total**.\n\nWhile 「まるで」 can independently mean \"entirely\" or \"completely\" in certain contexts (e.g., 「まるでだめだ」 - \"It's completely useless\"), when paired with 「ようだ」 or 「みたいだ」, its role is to amplify the comparative meaning. Therefore, the phrase 「まるで…ようだ」 is specifically used when the speaker wants to highlight an overwhelming or striking resemblance.",

            "meaning": "As if, Just like",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "While 「まるで…ようだ」 emphasizes a sense of complete or near-complete similarity, 「かのようだ」 simply indicates a likeness without necessarily implying the same degree of intensity. 「かのようだ」 often implies a hypothetical or imagined resemblance, whereas 「まるで…ようだ」 often implies a striking, perceived reality."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「まるで」 adds a layer of \"entirely\" or \"completely\" to the comparison. If you want to express a strong, almost exaggerated similarity, 「まるで…ようだ」 is appropriate. If you simply want to indicate a resemblance, 「かのようだ」 may be a better choice.",

            "nuance": "The use of 「まるで」 emphasizes the extraordinary nature of her singing voice, making the comparison to an angel complete and striking.",
            "etymology": "The concept of an 'angel' (天使) in this context evokes a sense of pure, celestial beauty, enhancing the strong comparison made with 「まるで」."

            "nuance": "「まるで」 here conveys the speaker's extreme reaction and the overwhelming similarity to a garbage dump, emphasizing the complete mess.",
            "etymology": "「ゴミ 屋敷」 literally means 'garbage mansion', a vivid, somewhat exaggerated term for a very messy place, which pairs well with the emphatic 「まるで」."

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "serious",
            "nuance": "This sentence uses 「まるで…ように」 to modify the adjective 「寒い」 (cold), indicating the **manner** or **degree** of coldness. 「まるで」 intensifies the comparison, stressing that the coldness is **completely** like that of a refrigerator.",
            "etymology": "「冷蔵庫」 (reizouko) combines 「冷」 (rei, cold), 「蔵」 (zō, storehouse), and 「庫」 (ko, warehouse), literally a 'cold storage house'. This precise term for a refrigerator strengthens the analogy with the outside temperature."

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "friendly",
            "nuance": "Using 「みたいだ」 instead of 「ようだ」 makes the expression more casual and conversational, suitable for admiring something with a friend. 「まるで」 still adds emphasis to the dazzling appearance of the cake, as if it's completely a jewel. The final 「ね」 seeks agreement.",
            "etymology": "「宝石」 (houseki) means 'jewel' or 'gemstone', and its visual association with sparkle and preciousness makes it a strong comparison for something beautiful, amplified by 「まるで」."

            "speaker_age": "older",
            "nuance": "The use of 「まるで子供じゃないか」 by an older male implies a strong, almost exasperated criticism, typical of a more authoritative or paternal tone often heard from older men when admonishing someone younger. The rhetorical question 「じゃないか」 reinforces the speaker's judgment and expectation of agreement. 「子供」 (kodomo) itself can be used dismissively here.",
            "etymology": "「子供」 (kodomo) combines 「子」 (ko, child) and 「供」 (tomo, companion/offer). In this context, it's used to denote immaturity, highlighting the complete childlike nature of the action with 「まるで」."

            "nuance": "In a storytelling context, 「まるで」 enhances the dramatic effect, emphasizing the complete and almost supernatural nature of the disappearance. The phrase 「煙のように」 (like smoke) is a common simile, and 「まるで」 adds a layer of absolute resemblance.",
            "etymology": "The verb 「消え去る」 (kie saru) is a compound verb meaning 'to vanish completely' or 'to disappear without a trace'. It combines 「消える」 (kieru, to disappear) and 「去る」 (saru, to leave/go away), further intensifying the sense of complete disappearance, perfectly matched by 「まるで」."

            "etymology": "「人形」 (ningyō) means 'doll' or 'puppet'. The static, often expressionless nature of a doll makes it a suitable object for comparison when describing extreme stillness, reinforced by 「まるで」."

    "post_example_writeup": "When using 「まるで…ようだ」, pay close attention to the form preceding 「ようだ」 or 「みたいだ」. It follows the same rules as 「ようだ」 itself: plain form for verbs and い-adjectives, な-adjective stem + な, and noun + の. The 「まるで」 always precedes this structure to provide the emphatic 'entirely' or 'just as though' nuance.",
