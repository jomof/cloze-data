    "etymology": "「まるで」is an adverb meaning 'entirely' or 'completely.' 「ようだ」is an auxiliary verb indicating a resemblance or likeness. Together, they create a strong simile, suggesting something is 'just like' something else.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「まるで〜ようだ」 combines the adverb 「まるで」 (marude), meaning 'entirely' or 'completely,' with a description of something, followed by the auxiliary verb 「ようだ」 (you da or you desu). The whole expression can be understood as 'it seems entirely as though (A).' 「まるで」 is typically used at the beginning of a sentence, before the description of what (A) seems to be like.\n\nInstead of 「ようだ」, other expressions of conjecture may also be used, such as 「みたいだ」. The 'as if' or 'as though' nuance comes primarily from 「ようだ」 or 「みたいだ」, with 「まるで」 simply intensifying the comparison by meaning 'entirely' or 'completely.'",
