    "etymology": "The word 「まるで」 means \"completely\" or \"entirely\". 「ようだ」 means \"like\" or \"similar to\". The combination creates the nuance of something seeming **exactly** like something else.",
    "writeup": "「まるで…ようだ」 is a powerful expression used to convey a strong, often exaggerated, comparison or resemblance. It combines the adverb 「まるで」 (meaning \"entirely\" or \"completely,\" sometimes written as 「丸で」) with the auxiliary adjective 「ようだ」 (meaning \"as if\" or \"as though\"). This combination creates a sense of almost identical similarity.\n\n「まるで」 is placed at the beginning of the sentence or clause, preceding the description of what the subject seems to be like. The core nuance of \"as if\" or \"as though\" primarily comes from 「ようだ」 or its more casual counterpart, 「みたいだ」. 「まるで」 serves to intensify this comparison, emphasizing that the resemblance is **complete** or **total**.\n\nWhile 「まるで」 can independently mean \"entirely\" or \"completely\" in certain contexts (e.g., 「まるでだめだ」 - \"It's completely useless\"), when paired with 「ようだ」 or 「みたいだ」, its role is to amplify the comparative meaning. Therefore, the phrase 「まるで…ようだ」 is specifically used when the speaker wants to highlight an overwhelming or striking resemblance.",

            "nuance": "While 「まるで…ようだ」 emphasizes a sense of complete or near-complete similarity, 「かのようだ」 simply indicates a likeness without necessarily implying the same degree of intensity. 「かのようだ」 often implies a hypothetical or imagined resemblance, whereas 「まるで…ようだ」 often implies a striking, perceived reality."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「まるで」 adds a layer of \"entirely\" or \"completely\" to the comparison. If you want to express a strong, almost exaggerated similarity, 「まるで…ようだ」 is appropriate. If you simply want to indicate a resemblance, 「かのようだ」 may be a better choice.",
