id: gp9999
meaning: due to; because of; as a result of (negative outcome)
pronunciation:
  katakana: ガゲンインデ
  romaji: ga gen'in de
formation:
  Noun が 原因で: Indicates that the preceding noun is the cause of a negative or undesirable event.
  Plain form Sentence ことが 原因で: Indicates that the preceding plain form sentence/situation is the cause
    of a negative or undesirable event.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The phrase combines the noun 原因 (gen'in), meaning "cause" or "origin," with the particle で
  (de), which here denotes reason or cause. Thus, it literally means "by/with the cause," strongly emphasizing
  the direct link between the preceding element and the subsequent outcome. This direct attribution is
  why it's often used for negative results, as it pinpoints the source of the problem.
writeup: が原因で is a Japanese grammar pattern used to explain the reason or cause behind an event or situation,
  particularly when the outcome is undesirable, negative, or problematic. It literally translates to "due
  to [Noun/Event] being the cause." While it can sometimes be used neutrally, its primary nuance is to
  attribute a negative consequence to a specific cause. This makes it distinct from more general causal
  particles like から or ので, which can be used for any kind of outcome. It's frequently encountered in news
  reports, formal analyses, or discussions where accountability or a clear chain of events leading to
  a problem is being established. It carries a strong sense of direct causation and often implies that
  the preceding cause is the main, and often problematic, factor.

  - term: 〜ために (because of・for the sake of)
    meaning: because of, for the sake of, in order to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ために can express cause/reason, purpose, or benefit, and can be neutral or convey a positive
      nuance. が原因で specifically points to a cause of a negative outcome.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[casual・い-Adj・な-Adjな・Nounの]ため(に)
  - term: 〜によって (cause・reason)
    meaning: due to, by means of, depending on, according to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: によって can express cause/reason, but also means/method, or an agent in a passive sentence. While
      it can be used for negative outcomes, it doesn't inherently carry the "negative consequence" nuance
      as strongly as が原因で.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Nounによって (cause・reason)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between が原因で and similar expressions like 〜ために or 〜によって, consider
  the nuance of the consequence. が原因で is best suited for situations where the cause led to an undesirable
  or problematic result. While 〜ために and 〜によって can also state a cause, they are more neutral and can describe
  causes for positive or neutral outcomes. Think of が原因で as highlighting the "root cause" of a problem.
examples:

    japanese:
      - 大雨 {が 原因 で}、イベント は 中止 に なっ た。

          - 大雨 {だ から}、イベント は 中止 に なっ た。
        english: The event was cancelled because of heavy rain.
        hint: から is a general reason, but が原因で specifically emphasizes that the rain was the *cause* of
          the cancellation, often implying a negative impact. We're looking for an expression that attributes
          a specific negative event to its cause.
    scene: Two friends are discussing an outdoor event that couldn't happen.

          - 人的 ミス {に よっ て}、事故 が 発生 し まし た。
        english: An accident occurred by means of human error.
        hint: によって can also express cause, but が原因で more strongly implies the human error was the *root
          cause* of the accident, often used when explaining problematic outcomes. We're looking for an
          expression that clearly states the negative cause.

        english: The project failed for the sake of the budget being insufficient.
        hint: While のために can express cause, it often implies purpose or benefit. が原因で explicitly points
          to the insufficient budget as the *source* of the failure, which is a negative outcome. We're
          looking for a clear cause of a problematic situation.
    scene: Colleagues are discussing the reasons for a failed project.

          - 無理 {だ から}、風邪 が ひどく なっ た の。
        english: My cold got worse because of overwork.
        hint: から is a general reason, but が原因で more directly attributes the worsening cold to the specific
          cause of overwork, implying it's a problematic result. We're looking for a direct cause of a
          negative personal experience.
    scene: A woman is talking to her friend about her health struggles.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The use of の at the end of the sentence gives it a feminine, explanatory, and slightly soft
      tone. 無理が原因で clearly states the undesirable cause of her cold worsening.

        english: A power outage occurred due to a system malfunction.
        hint: により (more formal form of によって) can also state a cause, but が原因で puts stronger emphasis on

          source of a problem.

        english: He was fired from the company because he was always late.
        hint: While から states a reason, が原因で explicitly identifies his chronic lateness as the *direct
          cause* leading to the negative consequence of being fired. We're looking for the primary reason
          for an unfortunate outcome.
    scene: Two older men are chatting casually about a former colleague's unfortunate situation.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The casual tone and use of らしいよ (it seems, I heard) are typical of older male conversation,
      particularly when discussing sensitive topics indirectly. 遅刻していたことが原因で clearly attributes the firing
      to his habitual tardiness.

        english: Due to my lack of communication, there was a misunderstanding.
        hint: While particle で can denote cause, が原因で adds a stronger, more explicit emphasis on the lack
          of communication being the *root cause* of the misunderstanding. We're looking for a clear statement
          of accountability for a negative outcome.

        english: I failed the exam because I didn't study enough.
        hint: から is a common way to state a reason, but が原因で expresses a stronger sense of direct cause
          and effect, often with a nuance of regret or self-blame when the outcome is negative. We're
          looking for a clear, impactful cause of a personal failure.

          - ストレス {の ため に}、様々 な 病気 が 引き起こさ れ ます。
        english: For the sake of stress, various illnesses are brought about.
        hint: While のために can express a cause, it often has a nuance of purpose or benefit, which doesn't
          fit here. が原因で explicitly identifies stress as the *causal factor* for illnesses. We're looking
          for a clear cause of a problematic condition.
    scene: A doctor is explaining the health risks associated with stress.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
post_example_writeup: As illustrated in these examples, が原因で is a potent phrase for attributing negative
  outcomes to their specific causes. Its directness makes it suitable for both formal and informal contexts
  where the focus is on identifying the source of a problem.
