jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: casual
  usage-context: general
  function: Indicates an excessive degree or quantity of something, leading to a specific, often surprising
    or undesirable, outcome.
  nuance: Implies that the degree of something is beyond expectation or a normal limit, prompting a reaction
    or consequence. It often carries a sense of surprise or shock at the intensity or quantity.
  grammatical-role: modifies verbs, adjectives, or nouns (with の/にも)
  temporal-flow: The excessive condition (cause) precedes and directly leads to the consequence (effect).
  spatial-flow: The excessive state of something (e.g., size, number) leads to a physical limitation or
    difficulty in movement or management related to that excess.
etymology: Derived from 余る (amaru), meaning "to remain" or "to be in excess." あまりに (amari ni) thus conveys
  the sense of something exceeding a normal or acceptable limit.
writeup: |-
  **あまりに (amari ni)** is an adverbial expression used to convey that something is "too much" or "excessive," which then leads to a particular result. It is frequently employed when expressing surprise or shock regarding the intensity or degree of something. While it can be translated simply as "so much (A) that (B)" or "way too much (A)," its core meaning is closer to "excessively." Therefore, thinking of it as "it is excessively (A), so (B)" can often capture its full nuance.

  This grammar point can modify verbs and adjectives directly, or nouns when followed by の or にも. The inclusion of も (forming **あまりにも**), while optional, adds further emphasis to the "excess" of the preceding element, highlighting an even more pronounced or extreme outcome.

  It is important to note that あんまり (anmari) is a colloquial variant of あまり. While commonly used in spoken Japanese, it should generally be avoided in formal or official writing due to its informal nature.
false_friends:
  - term: すぎる (too much・excessive)
    meaning: Too much, excessive
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While すぎる indicates something is "too much," it doesn't necessarily imply a surprising or
      shocking outcome as あまりに often does. すぎる can also be attached to verbs, which あまりに cannot.
    grammar_point: すぎる (too much・excessive)
  - term: なかなか (quite not easily)
    meaning: Very, quite, considerably; (with negative form) not easily or readily.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: なかなか expresses a degree of something but lacks the excessive nuance and resulting consequence
      that あまりに conveys.
    grammar_point: なかなか (quite not easily)
  - term: あまり (so much that)
    meaning: So much...that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: あまり alone can also mean "so much that," but あまりに emphasizes the excessive nature even more
      strongly.
    grammar_point: あまり (so much that)
  - term: とても (very)
    meaning: Very, extremely, terribly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: とても is a general intensifier that means 'very' or 'extremely,' but unlike あまりに, it describes
      a high degree without inherently implying an excessive amount that leads to a specific, often surprising
      or undesirable, outcome.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:とても (very)
  - term: どんなに〜ても (no matter how much)
    meaning: No matter how
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While どんなに〜ても expresses an idea of extreme degree, it focuses on the conditional aspect (even
      if it's extremely X, Y happens/doesn't happen) rather than the direct cause-and-effect of an excessive
      state leading to a consequence.
    grammar_point: どんなに〜ても (no matter how much)
post_false_friends_writeup: While すぎる, なかなか, あまり, とても, and どんなに〜ても can sometimes be used in similar contexts,
  it's important to remember that あまりに specifically indicates an excessive degree leading to a surprising
  or impactful outcome. すぎる is a more general expression and can be attached to verbs. なかなか, on the other
  hand, shows a degree of something without implying the element of excess or an unexpected consequence
  that あまりに conveys. とても is a direct intensifier that simply means "very" or "extremely" without the implication
  of an excessive quantity or degree leading to a specific result. どんなに〜ても emphasizes a conditional outcome
  regardless of the degree, rather than a direct consequence of an excessive state.
