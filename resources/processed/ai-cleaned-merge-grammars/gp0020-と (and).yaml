    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 is believed to have originated from the verb 「共にする (tomo ni suru)」, meaning \"to do together\" or \"to share.\" Over time, it evolved into a particle used to connect nouns, indicating that they are related or exist together, particularly in an exhaustive list. Its modern use as a simple conjunctive particle for nouns highlights a historical progression from more active, shared meanings to a static, connective function.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「と」 is used to exhaustively list nouns, functioning similarly to \"and\" in English. It connects two or more items, indicating that all mentioned items are included in the group or action. When listing multiple items, 「と」 is placed after each noun, although the final 「と」 in the series is commonly omitted in casual speech and often in polite conversation.\nIt is crucial to understand that 「と」 signifies an **exhaustive** list. This means that only the items explicitly mentioned with 「と」 are part of the group. This contrasts with particles like 「や」, which implies a non-exhaustive list, suggesting \"things like A, B, and so on.\"\nWhile 「と」 can also indicate an action performed \"with\" someone or something, that specific usage, such as 「友達 と 映画 に 行く (tomodachi to eiga ni iku - to go to a movie with a friend)」, is distinct and typically covered under a separate grammar point. This current explanation focuses solely on 「と」 as a conjunctive particle for listing nouns.\nIn terms of formality, 「と」 itself is quite neutral and can be used across various registers, from casual to formal. The overall politeness of the sentence will depend on the verb endings and other particles used.",

For more complex relationships like simultaneity or proportionality, expressions like 「と共に」 or 「につれて」 are used.
