    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 is believed to have originated from the verb 「共にする (tomo ni suru)」, meaning \"to do together\" or \"to share.\" Over time, it evolved into a particle used to connect nouns, indicating that they are related or exist together.",
    "writeup": "「と」 is a particle primarily used to mean \"and\" in English. More broadly, it shows a relationship of 'compilation' between two items. This relationship could be that they exist together (translated as \"and\") or that they perform an action together (translated as \"with\"). Here, we'll focus on the \"and\" translation.\n\n「と」 is required after each noun it groups. However, the final 「と」 in a sentence is often omitted. In conversation, the last 「と」 will almost always be dropped, though including it is considered more correct, especially in formal writing. Remember that 「と」 is distinct from 「や」, which indicates a non-exhaustive list, and 「も」, which means \"also\" or \"too.\"",
