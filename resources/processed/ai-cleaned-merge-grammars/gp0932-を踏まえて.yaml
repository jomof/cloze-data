    "etymology": "「踏まえて」comes from the verb 「踏まえる (fumaeru)」, which means \"to step on,\" \"to be based on,\" or \"to take into account.\" The 「て」form indicates a state or condition resulting from that action. Therefore, 「を踏まえて」 literally means \"having stepped on (something),\" but figuratively means \"based on\" or \"considering\" something.",
    "writeup": "「を踏まえて」 indicates that something is being done based on a certain premise or with something in mind. 「踏まえる」 as a verb means \"to tread firmly,\" but in this grammatical context, it's used figuratively to mean \"taking something into account.\" It's used in formal situations where action (B) is undertaken with (A) as the premise. Because it begins with 「を」, it follows a noun. It's similar to \"based on,\" \"considering,\" or \"taking into account.\"",
