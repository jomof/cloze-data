    "etymology": "The verb 「いらっしゃる」 is an honorific (尊敬語, sonkeigo) form of the verbs 「いる」 (to be), 「行く」 (to go), and 「来る」 (to come). Its origin is believed to stem from a combination of 「入る」 (to enter) and 「在る」 (to be), thus conveying a sense of someone important 'entering' or 'being present' in a particular state or location. Over time, this evolved into its current usage as a versatile honorific verb.",
    "writeup": "「いらっしゃる」 is a highly versatile **honorific** expression in Japanese. It serves as the respectful equivalent for three common verbs: 「いる」 (to be), 「行く」 (to go), and 「来る」 (to come). As an honorific verb, it is **never** used to refer to the speaker themselves or their own actions; its purpose is to elevate the status of the person being referred to, demonstrating deference and respect.\n\nThis grammar point can replace 「いる」, 「行く」, or 「来る」 directly. Additionally, 「いらっしゃる」 can follow the **te-form** of another verb (e.g., 〜ていらっしゃる) to respectfully describe a continuous action or a state. It is an essential component of polite Japanese, frequently encountered in business settings, when addressing superiors, or interacting with elders.\n\nIt is worth noting that 「おいでになる」 is another expression that can replace 「いる」, 「来る」, or 「行く」. While 「おいでになる」 and 「いらっしゃる」 are often interchangeable, 「いらっしゃる」 is generally more common and versatile.",
