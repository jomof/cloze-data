  どんな + Noun: Used to inquire about the characteristics, type, or nature of a noun.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The word 「どんな」 is a contraction derived from the phrase 「どの様な」 (dono you na), which literally
  means “of what kind” or “in what manner.” Here, 「どの」 functions as an interrogative demonstrative, and
  「様」 (you) signifies “way,” “manner,” or “kind.” Over time, this phrase evolved into the more colloquial
  and common 「どんな」, retaining its core meaning of inquiring about the nature or characteristics of something.
  This evolution reflects the natural tendency in language to simplify and shorten frequently used expressions.
writeup: |-
  「どんな」 is an interrogative determiner used to ask about the **nature, type, or characteristics** of a noun. It directly precedes the noun it modifies, functioning similarly to 'what kind of' or 'what sort of' in English. It is a very common and versatile expression used in everyday conversation.

  Unlike simply asking 'what' (何 - nan/nani), which asks for identification, 「どんな」 seeks a description or classification. For example, if you ask 「何の本ですか？」 (Nan no hon desu ka?), you might be asking for the title or subject of the book. But if you ask 「どんな本ですか？」 (Donna hon desu ka?), you are inquiring about its genre, its quality (e.g., interesting, difficult), or its physical attributes (e.g., thick, old).

  It can be used to ask about a wide range of attributes, including appearance, personality, quality, type, or general impression. Its broad applicability makes it a fundamental part of expressing curiosity and gathering information in Japanese.

  - term: どういう
    meaning: What kind of (explanatory)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both 「どんな」 and 「どういう」 translate to 'what kind of,' their nuances differ. 「どんな」 directly
      asks for a general type or characteristic. 「どういう」, on the other hand, often implies a request for
      a more detailed explanation, definition, or the rationale behind something. For instance, 「どんなスポーツが好きですか？」
      (What kind of sports do you like?) asks about preferred types of sports, whereas 「どういう意味ですか？」 (Dō
      iu imi desu ka? - What does that mean?) asks for an explanation of meaning.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どういう (what kind of, explanatory)
  - term: 何の
    meaning: What (kind of); what is it for
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「何の」 is generally used to inquire about the purpose, material, affiliation, or a more direct
      classification where 'what' precedes the noun. For example, 「何の飲み物ですか？」 (Nan no nomimono desu ka?
      - What drink/Drink of what?) asks for the specific name or category of the drink. In contrast, 「どんな飲み物ですか？」
      (Donna nomimono desu ka? - What kind of drink?) asks about its characteristics, such as taste (sweet,
      sour) or temperature (hot, cold).
    grammar_point: 何 (what)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate, remember that 「どんな」 seeks a **description or characteristic**.
  「どのような」 is its **polite equivalent**. 「どういう」 asks for a **detailed explanation or the reason/method
  behind something**. 「何の」 typically inquires about **purpose, material, or direct classification**.
