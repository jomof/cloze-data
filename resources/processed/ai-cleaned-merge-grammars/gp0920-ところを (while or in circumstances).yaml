details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to politely acknowledge someone's current state or situation when interrupting them,
    or to describe a precise moment when an action is taking place and is often interrupted.
  function: Expresses apology or gratitude for interruption, or highlights a specific point of occurrence/interruption.
  nuance: Emphasizes sensitivity to the listener's circumstances or precise timing of an event; conveys
    a sense of being "in the middle of" an action or state.
  grammatical-role: adverbial phrase
  temporal-flow: concurrent with an action or state
  spatial-flow: not applicable for this grammar point and its meaning, as it denotes a situation rather
    than physical space for motion verbs or physical objects in space for static location verbs or object
    verbs. It refers to a conceptual space (situation or state) rather than a physical space for objects
    or agents.
etymology: 「ところ」 refers to a specific point in time or a situation. The particle 「を」 indicates the object
  of an action. Thus, 「ところを」 literally marks a situation which is being 'used' or 'affected' in some way,
  either by the speaker apologizing for intruding or by an event interrupting the ongoing situation.
writeup: |-
  「ところを」 combines the noun **ところ** (place, situation) with the particle **を**. This grammar construction expresses two primary meanings and is often used in formal contexts. Firstly, it conveys "in spite of" or "regardless of" a situation, typically employed to politely acknowledge someone's circumstances and express an apology for an interruption or gratitude for their efforts despite their situation. This nuance can follow verbs in their plain forms, い-adjectives, な-adjectives followed by な, or nouns followed by の.

  Secondly, 「ところを」 can mean "when" or "while," focusing on an action that is in progress and is then interrupted. This usage primarily follows verbs in their plain forms. Both meanings can carry either positive or negative implications depending on the context. The particle **を** itself can sometimes be omitted without changing the core meaning.

  This expression allows the speaker to acknowledge the specific state or action of another person, showing consideration and politeness when an interaction or event intrudes upon that state or action.
false_friends:
  - term: ところに
    meaning: right when; at the point where
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ところに」 indicates an event happening *at* a specific moment or situation, often an interruption.
      In contrast, 「ところを」 highlights being caught *in* an action or politely acknowledges the existing
      situation being intruded upon, leading to apology or gratitude.
    grammar_point: ところに・ところへ (timing a new event)
  - term: 最中に
    meaning: in the middle of; at the height of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express 'in the middle of,' 「最中に」 emphasizes an event occurring *during* the peak
      of an ongoing action, often an unexpected interruption. 「ところを」, on the other hand, can be used more
      broadly to refer to a general state or situation being acknowledged when apologizing, or simply
      being caught in the act without necessarily implying a 'peak' moment.
    grammar_point: 最中に (in the middle of)
  - term: にもかかわらず
    meaning: despite; in spite of; regardless
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Both convey 'despite.' 「にもかかわらず」 is a more direct, general conjunction expressing a lack of
      correlation between two clauses. 「ところを」, while also meaning 'in spite of,' is specifically used
      when acknowledging someone's current *state or circumstances* (e.g., busy, resting) and expressing
      an apology or gratitude for intruding upon or acting contrary to that state. It carries a strong
      sense of consideration for the listener's situation.
    grammar_point: にもかかわらず (despite)
  - term: ところで
    meaning: by the way; incidentally; well
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ところで」 is a discourse marker used to change the subject of conversation or introduce a new
      point. 「ところを」, in contrast, connects clauses to express an apology for interruption or to specify
      the timing/circumstances of an event.
    grammar_point: ところで (by the way)
post_false_friends_writeup: Distinguishing expressions like 「ところを」 from 「ところに」, 「最中に」, and 「ところで」 requires
  understanding their distinct roles. 「ところを」 is used for apologizing for interruptions or acknowledging
  specific situations, often implying a state or situation being intruded upon. 「ところに」 indicates an event
  happening at a specific point in time. 「最中に」 emphasizes an interruption during the peak of an action.
  「ところで」, on the other hand, is primarily used to change the topic of conversation or add an aside. Always
  consider the context and the precise meaning of 'situation' or 'moment' to choose the correct phrase.
examples:
  - english: I apologize for disturbing you while you are resting, but may I urgently call you?
    japanese:
      - お 休み 中 の {ところ を} 恐れ入り ます が、至急 お 電話 を 差し上げ て も よろしい でしょう か。
      - お 休み 中 の {ところ を} 申し訳 あり ませ ん が、急ぎ お 電話 し て も よろしい でしょう か。
      - 休憩 中 の {ところ を} 恐れ入り ます が、すぐ に お 電話 差し上げ て も よろしい でしょう か。
    english_literally: In the situation of your rest, it's terrible to intrude, but regarding an urgent
      phone call, would it be okay if I give it?

      - competing_japanese:
          - お 休み 中 の ところ に 恐縮 です が、至急 お 電話 し て も よろしい でしょう か。
        english: I apologize for calling you right when you are resting, but may I urgently call you?
        hint: 「ところに」 highlights the precise timing of an event. 「ところを」 emphasizes acknowledging existing
          circumstances when intruding, often for apology or gratitude.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 休ん で いる 時 に すみ ませ ん が
        english: I'm sorry to call you while you're resting (at that time).
        hint: The scene depicts a professional interaction where high formality and deference are expected,
          especially from a subordinate to a supervisor. While 「休んでいる時に」 is grammatically valid, it lacks
          the specific nuance of acknowledging the listener's ongoing state and expressing a polite apology
          for interrupting that precise situation, which 「ところを」 inherently carries. We're looking for
          this higher degree of politeness.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 休憩 中 に 申し訳 あり ませ ん が
        english: I'm sorry while you are on a break.
        hint: 「休憩中に」 refers to the general duration of a break rather than the specific moment of being
          'in the act' of resting. We're looking for the precision in highlighting the exact state being
          interrupted.
    scene: A junior colleague needs to urgently contact a senior colleague who is known to be taking a
      break.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「お 休み 中 の」 (respectful language for 'resting') and 「恐れ入り ます が」 (a highly polite
      expression of apology for intrusion) highlights the formal register and the speaker's respect for
      the senior colleague's time. This phrasing is common in business communication when interrupting
      someone's private time.
  - english: He was discovered by the enemy while carrying out a secret operation.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 秘密 の 作戦 を 実行 し て いる {ところ を}、敵 に 発見 さ れ て しまっ た。
      - 秘密 の 作戦 を 遂行 し て いる {ところ を}、敵 に 見つかっ て しまっ た。

          - 彼 は 秘密 の 作戦 を 実行 し て いる ところ に、敵 に 発見 さ れ た。
        english: He was discovered by the enemy right when he was carrying out a secret operation.
        hint: 「ところに」 emphasizes an event occurring at a specific point in time. 「ところを」 highlights being
          caught in the act or a situation being unexpectedly intruded upon.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 実行 し て いる 時 に 敵 に 発見 さ れ て しまっ た。
        english: He was discovered by the enemy when he was carrying out the operation.
        hint: The spy scenario emphasizes the critical, precise moment of being caught *during* the action.
          While 「時に」 indicates 'when,' 「ところを」 conveys the stronger sense of being caught 'in the very
          act' or 'in the middle of' an action, which is more impactful for this high-stakes situation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 実行 中 に 敵 に 発見 さ れ て しまっ た。
        english: He was discovered by the enemy during the operation.
        hint: 「実行中に」 refers to the general duration of the operation. The scene requires emphasis on the
          exact, vulnerable moment of discovery, which 「ところを」 conveys with greater precision for an immediate
          interruption.
    scene: A spy is on a mission and gets caught in the act.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: This sentence describes being caught at the critical juncture of an action. The use of 「発見
      さ れ て しまっ た」 (was discovered, with unfortunate implication) emphasizes the negative outcome of being
      found at that specific, vulnerable moment during the operation.
  - english: Thank you very much for coming all the way, despite the cold weather.
    japanese:

          - 寒い の に 来 て くださっ て、ありがとう ござい ます。
        english: Thank you for coming despite the cold.
        hint: While 「寒いのに」 conveys 'despite the cold,' it is less formal and lacks the specific nuance
          of acknowledging the listener's effort in enduring that specific 'situation' of coldness. We're
          looking for the host's high politeness in acknowledging the guests' effort.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 寒い 時 に 来 て くださっ て、ありがとう ござい ます。
        english: Thank you for coming when it's cold.
        hint: 「時に」 refers to a general time period. The scene requires expressing gratitude for overcoming
          a specific, ongoing *condition* or *situation* (the cold), which 「ところを」 highlights more aptly
          than a simple time marker.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 寒い に も かかわら ず 来 て くださっ て、ありがとう ござい ます。
        english: Thank you for coming all the way despite the cold.
        hint: Although 「にもかかわらず」 means 'despite,' it is a general conjunction. 「ところを」 specifically acknowledges
          the listener's effort in enduring the difficult circumstance (cold) and apologizes for imposing,
          showing a deeper level of consideration.
    scene: A host greeting guests who have arrived on a very cold day.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The combination of 「寒い ところ を」 (acknowledging the cold situation) with 「わざわざ お 越し くださり」 (a
      very polite expression for 'coming all the way') and 「誠 に ありがとう ござい ます」 (truly thankful) shows extreme
      gratitude and consideration for the guests' effort in enduring an uncomfortable condition. This
      is a common phrase used in formal greetings.
  - english: I am truly sorry for troubling you, despite your being very busy.
    japanese:

        english: I am truly sorry for troubling you right when you are busy.

          existing state of busyness when making an apology for causing inconvenience.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 忙しい の に、ご 面倒 を かけ し て 申し訳 ござい ませ ん。
        english: I'm sorry for bothering you despite your being busy.
        hint: While 「忙しいのに」 means 'despite being busy,' it's less formal and lacks the profound deference
          expressed by 「お 忙しい ところ を」, which specifically acknowledges the manager's current state of intense
          activity as the point of intrusion. We're looking for a higher level of respectful apology.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 忙しい 時 に、ご 面倒 を かけ し て 申し訳 ござい ませ ん。
        english: I'm sorry for bothering you at a busy time.
        hint: 「忙しい時に」 simply means 'at a busy time'. We're looking for a deeper acknowledgment of the
          listener's ongoing busy *state* or *situation* that the speaker is inconveniencing. 「ところを」 is
          more precise in conveying this specific context of intrusion.
    scene: A junior employee asks for a favor from a very busy senior manager.
    register: sonkeigo (respectful)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「お 忙しい ところ を」 (respectful acknowledgement of busyness) combined with 「大変 恐縮 です が」 (deep apology
      for inconvenience) and 「ご 面倒 を お かけ し て 申し訳 ござい ませ ん」 (apology for causing trouble) showcases the
      speaker's extreme politeness and humility toward the listener, typical in situations where one imposes
      on a superior or busy individual. This example demonstrates a highly deferential communication style
      suitable for a female junior employee speaking to a male senior manager.
  - english: I am sorry to bother you for your help, especially since it's your precious day off.
    japanese:
      - せっかく の 休日 な の {ところ を}、お 手伝い いただき 恐縮 です。

        english: I am sorry to bother you for your help right when it's your precious day off.
        hint: 「ところに」 focuses on bothering someone right on their day off. 「ところを」 acknowledges and apologizes
          for imposing despite the valuable circumstances of their day off.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 休日 の 日 に 手伝っ て もらっ て 恐縮 です。
        english: I am sorry to have you help me on your day off.
        hint: 「休日 の 日 に」 focuses broadly on the day. We're looking for emphasis on the speaker's consideration
          for the friend's 'precious day off,' highlighting the value of that specific leisure situation.
          「ところを」 conveys this precise intrusion on a valuable, ongoing state.

          - 休み な の に 手伝っ て もらっ て 恐縮 です。
        english: I am sorry to have you help me even though it's your day off.
        hint: 「休み な の に」 means 'even though it's a day off,' focusing on contrast. While valid, it lacks
          the specific acknowledgment of interrupting the 'situation' of a precious day off that 「ところを」
          provides, which is more aligned with the scene's nuance.
    scene: Someone is asking a friend for help on their day off.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: apologetic
    nuance: The phrase 「せっかく の 休日 な の ところ を」 emphasizes the speaker's awareness of inconveniencing the
      listener's valuable free time by highlighting that specific precious situation. 「恐縮 です」 is a polite
      way to express 'I am sorry' or 'I am grateful yet feel bad about it.' This phrasing conveys a polite
      apology for disturbing someone on your valuable leisure time.

        english: Just as I was about to leave the house, at that time, the phone rang.
        hint: While 「時に」 can indicate a specific time, 「ところを」 places a stronger emphasis on being 'in
          the very act' of an action when something occurs or interrupts. We are looking for that precise,
          in-the-moment nuance.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 家 を 出よう と し たら、電話 が 鳴っ た。
        english: If I had been about to leave the house, the phone rang.
        hint: 「たら」 expresses a conditional or a trigger for an event. 「ところを」 describes an ongoing situation

          - ちょうど 家 を 出よう と し て いる 最中 に、電話 が 鳴っ た。
        english: Just as I was about to leave the house, in the middle of it, the phone rang.
        hint: 「最中に」 emphasizes an event occurring *during* the peak of an ongoing action, implying an
          unexpected interruption. 「ところを」 can also convey this, but often for actions about to happen
          or a state being maintained, rather than necessarily the 'peak' of an activity.
    scene: Someone recounts a common daily occurrence to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: This example highlights the use of 「ところを」 to describe a precise moment when an action (leaving
      the house) is about to happen or is in progress and is then interrupted by another event (the phone
      ringing). The casual register makes it suitable for everyday conversation.

        hint: 「お 仕事 中 に」 refers to the general period of working. 「ところを」 specifically acknowledges and

        english: Excuse me while you are working, but could I have a moment?
        hint: While 「時 に」 means 'when,' 「ところを」 conveys a deeper sense of consideration by specifically
          acknowledging the delicate situation of interrupting someone's concentration. The scene implies
          a need for a higher degree of politeness than a general time marker.
    scene: A junior colleague needs to speak with a senior colleague who is visibly absorbed in a task.
    register: formal
    setting: professional

    nuance: The use of 「お 仕事 に 集中 し て いらっしゃる」 (honorific for 'concentrating on work') combined with 「ところを
      申し訳 ござい ませ ん」 emphasizes the speaker's politeness and awareness of intruding on the listener's focused
      state. This phrasing is crucial for showing respect in a professional hierarchy, particularly when
      asking for attention from someone busy.

          effort.

          for their attendance, showing a deeper level of consideration.
    scene: A host welcoming guests to an outdoor event on a particularly hot summer day.

    setting: informative
    nuance: This phrasing, using 「猛暑 の ところ を」 or 「暑い ところ を」, emphasizes the speaker's empathy and gratitude
      for the guests' effort in braving the difficult weather conditions. 「遠路 はるばる お 越し くださり」 (coming
      a long way) further magnifies the appreciation, typical in formal greetings where significant effort
      from the guest is acknowledged.

        hint: 「なのに」 implies a contrast ('even though'). 「ところを」 expresses a more polite acknowledgement

          for intrusion. We're looking for a more considerate tone.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: I'm sorry while you are relaxing, but could I have a little of your time?
        hint: 「時 に」 simply indicates 'when.' 「ところを」 highlights the specific 'state' or 'situation' of
          relaxation that is being disturbed, adding a layer of politeness and consideration.
    scene: You need to ask a family member or close colleague for a favor, but they are currently resting
      or relaxing.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: apologetic
    nuance: The phrase 「お 寛ぎ 中 な ところ を」 politely acknowledges the listener's state of relaxation, showing
      consideration before imposing. 「恐縮 です が」 conveys a respectful apology for the interruption. This
      type of phrasing is common when needing to ask for something from someone who is in their personal
      or leisure time.

      - competing_japanese:
          - お 忙しい の に、わざわざ 足 を お 運び いただき、誠 に ありがとう ござい ます。
        english: Thank you for purposely coming all this way, even though you are busy.
        hint: 「なのに」 is a more direct 'even though' and lacks the subtle politeness of 「ところを」 in acknowledging
          someone's busy 'situation' or 'state' as the context for their effort. We're looking for a more
          deferential expression.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 忙しい 時 に わざわざ 足 を お 運び いただき、誠 に ありがとう ござい ます。
        english: Thank you for purposely coming all this way at a busy time.
        hint: 「時 に」 simply refers to a general time. 「ところを」 specifically emphasizes the difficult 'condition'
          of being busy, highlighting the guest's dedication despite their circumstances. The scene requires
          a profound expression of gratitude for their sacrifice of time.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ご 多忙 に も かかわら ず、遠路 はるばる お 越し くださり、心 より 御 礼 申し上げ ます。
        english: Thank you for coming all this way despite your busy schedule.
        hint: Although 「にもかかわらず」 means 'despite,' it is a general conjunction. 「ところを」 specifically acknowledges
          the listener's effort in enduring the difficult circumstance (busy schedule) and expresses gratitude
          for their attendance, showing a deeper level of consideration.
    scene: A host or company representative expresses deep gratitude to an important client or guest who
      has made a significant effort to attend an event or meeting despite their demanding schedule.
    register: sonkeigo (respectful)
    setting: professional
    nuance: This highly formal expression combines 「お 忙しい 中 の ところ を」 (acknowledging their busy schedule
      with utmost respect) with phrases like 「わざわざ 足 を お 運び いただき」 (わざわざ is 'purposely,' 足 を お 運び いただき
      is an honorific way of saying 'to come') to convey profound appreciation for the guest's considerable
      effort. This is essential in business settings to show deference and value for the guest's time
      and presence.
  - english: Just as I was about to complain to the manager, he suddenly started crying.
    japanese:
      - 課長 に 文句 を 言おう と し て いる {ところ を}、彼 が 急 に 泣き 出し た。
      - 上司 に 苦情 を 言い に 行こう と し て い た {ところ を}、彼 が 突然 泣き 始め た。
    english_literally: Regarding the situation of me being about to complain to the manager, he suddenly
      started crying.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 課長 に 文句 を 言おう と し て いる 時 に、彼 が 急 に 泣き 出し た。
        english: Just as I was about to complain to the manager, at that time, he suddenly started crying.
        hint: While 「時に」 can indicate a specific time, 「ところを」 places a stronger emphasis on being 'in
          the very act' or 'on the verge of' an action when something occurs or interrupts, making the
          interruption more impactful.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 課長 に 文句 を 言おう と し たら、彼 が 急 に 泣き 出し た。
        english: If I had been about to complain to the manager, he suddenly started crying.
        hint: 「たら」 expresses a conditional or a trigger for an event. 「ところを」 describes an ongoing or impending
          situation that is unexpectedly interrupted by another event, creating a sense of being caught
          off guard.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 課長 に 文句 を 言おう と し て いる 最中 に、彼 が 急 に 泣き 出し た。
        english: In the middle of being about to complain to the manager, he suddenly started crying.
        hint: 「最中に」 emphasizes an event occurring *during* the peak of an ongoing action, implying an
          unexpected interruption. 「ところを」 can also convey this, but often applies more broadly to the
          'state' of being about to do something, not necessarily the peak of the act itself.
    scene: A frustrated employee is about to confront their manager about a grievance, but a surprising
      emotional outburst from the manager changes the situation.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: This example demonstrates the use of 「ところを」 to describe a precise moment or 'state' (being
      on the verge of complaining) that is unexpectedly interrupted by another event. The nuance here
      is about the speaker's planned action being thwarted or altered due to the sudden and surprising
      turn of events, highlighting the abrupt shift in the situation.
post_example_writeup: The usage of 「ところを」 always indicates a polite acknowledgment of someone's current
  situation or a precise timing of an event. When expressing apology or gratitude, it highlights the speaker's
  awareness of inconveniencing the listener's specific ongoing state. When describing an interruption,
  it pinpoints the exact moment an action was taking place, making the description vivid and precise.
