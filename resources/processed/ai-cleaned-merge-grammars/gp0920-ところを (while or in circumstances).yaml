jlpt: N2
etymology: The word 「ところ」 (tokoro) originally meant 'place' or 'location.' Over time, its meaning expanded
  metaphorically to include 'time,' 'point,' or 'situation.' The particle 「を」 (o), typically a direct
  object marker, is used here to indicate the 'point' or 'situation' that is being passed through or affected
  by the subsequent action. Thus, 「ところを」 literally means 'passing through/at this point/situation,' emphasizing
  the specific circumstances or timing.
writeup: 'The expression 「ところを」 is used to precisely pinpoint a moment or a situation during which another
  event occurs. It functions to set the scene or context for the subsequent action, often highlighting
  that the action is an interruption, a polite intrusion, or something done despite the prevailing circumstances.
  It lends a sense of politeness or formality, particularly when used in apologies or requests, implying
  "at such a busy/inconvenient time." This grammar point can be attached to various forms: dictionary
  form verbs (indicating an action about to happen), past tense verbs (indicating an action that has just
  happened or completed), -ている form verbs (indicating an ongoing action), -ない form verbs (indicating a
  state of not doing something), い-adjectives, な-adjectives (with な), and nouns (with の). The choice of
  preceding form sets the specific temporal or situational context. While often translated simply as "while"
  or "when," 「ところを」 carries a stronger nuance of highlighting the specific *context* or *point in time*
  that makes the following action significant, often in an apologetic or considerate way. It''s frequently
  used in formal or polite situations, particularly when apologizing for an imposition or expressing gratitude
  for an action taken despite difficult conditions. For instance, if someone is busy, you might say, 「お忙しいところを申し訳ありません」
  (I apologize for disturbing you while you are busy).'

  - term: ところだ
    meaning: about to; just did; in the process of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ところだ」 primarily expresses the immediate timing of an action (just about to, just did, or
      currently doing), focusing on the temporal proximity. In contrast, 「ところを」 emphasizes the *circumstances*
      or *situation* at that time, often leading to a secondary nuance of apology or consideration.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ところだ (about to do)'
  - term: ときに
    meaning: at the time of; when
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ときに」 is a more general temporal marker that simply indicates 'when' or 'at the time of' an
      event, without necessarily implying interruption, apology, or a particular circumstance. 「ところを」
      specifically highlights the *particular state* or *specific moment* as the context for the subsequent
      action, often with an implied sense of politeness or imposition.
    grammar_point: とき (when)
  - term: にもかかわらず
    meaning: despite; even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both can indicate an action taken despite circumstances, 「にもかかわらず」 explicitly states
      a contradiction or defiance against the preceding condition. 「ところを」 merely sets the scene of the
      circumstance, with the nuance of 'despite' being *implied* by the context of the second clause (e.g.,
      apologizing for interrupting).
    grammar_point: にかかわらず (regardless of)
  - term: 際に
    meaning: on the occasion of; at the time of (formal)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「際に」 is a more formal and objective way to state 'at the time of' or 'on the occasion of,'
      suitable for official or descriptive contexts. 「ところを」 retains a more personal and subjective feel,
      emphasizing the specific 'point' or 'situation' and often carrying emotional or interpersonal nuances
      like apology or consideration.
    grammar_point: 際に・折に・に当たって・に際して (on the occasion of・when)
post_false_friends_writeup: When differentiating 「ところを」 from similar expressions, remember that 「ところを」
  places a strong emphasis on the *specific situation* or *exact moment* that precedes the main action,
  often to imply that the second action is somehow out of place or considerate given the first. It's less
  about simple timing like 「ときに」, or merely stating a contradiction like 「にもかかわらず」, and more about establishing
  a precise, often sensitive, context. Its use frequently carries an underlying tone of politeness, apology,
  or gratitude.

  - english: I apologize for disturbing you while you are busy.
    japanese:
      - お 忙しい {ところ を} 申し訳 あり ませ ん。

          - お 忙しい とき に 申し訳 あり ませ ん。
        english: I apologize for disturbing you when you are busy.
        hint: 「ときに」 is a general temporal marker, less emphasizing the specific (perhaps inconvenient)
          state of being busy. We're looking for a phrase that highlights the specific busy circumstance
          as the reason for the apology.
    scene: You are approaching a colleague who is clearly engrossed in their work.

        english: Despite it being cold, you came well.
        hint: 「にもかかわらず」 explicitly states 'despite,' but 「ところを」 focuses on the specific *circumstance*
          of it being cold, subtly implying gratitude for their effort in that condition. We're looking
          for an expression that directly points to the difficult circumstance.
    scene: A host greets guests who have arrived on a particularly chilly day.

        english: I'm sorry for calling you when it's late at night.
        hint: 「ときに」 is broader. We need to emphasize the specific, potentially inconvenient *situation*
          of it being late at night.
    scene: You've realized you need to make an urgent call, but it's very late.

      - 彼 が すごく 楽し そう に し てる {ところ を}、助け を 求める の は 気 が 引け た。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が とても 楽し そう に し て いる とき に、助け を 求める の は 気 が 引け た。
        english: When he was looking very happy, I felt hesitant to ask for help.
        hint: 「ときに」 simply marks the time. We want to highlight the specific *joyful state* as the context
          that made asking for help difficult.
    scene: Observing a friend who is having a great time, you feel bad about bringing up a problem.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The phrase 「楽しそうにしているところを」 points out the specific positive mood of the person, making the
      act of asking for help seem like an imposition. This nuanced use of 「ところを」 emphasizes the contrast
      between the person's state and the speaker's need.
  - english: Just as I was about to go out, an unexpected visitor arrived.
    japanese:
      - 出かけよう と し て いる {ところ を}、急 な 来客 が あっ た。
      - 出かけよう と し て い た {ところ を}、急 な 来客 が あっ た。

          - 出かけよう と し て いる とき に、急 な 来客 が あっ た。
        english: When I was about to go out, an unexpected visitor arrived.
        hint: 「ときに」 indicates the timing generally. 「ところを」 specifies the exact *point* of being 'about
          to' do something, implying an interruption at that critical moment. We're looking for that precise
          timing.
    scene: You were just putting on your shoes to leave the house.

  - english: I found it hard to refuse his request, as he had come all this way.
    japanese:
      - 遠い {ところ を} わざわざ 来 て くれ た {ところ を}、彼 の 頼み を 断る の は 忍び なかっ た。
      - 遠い {ところ を} わざわざ 来 て くれ た {ところ を}、頼み を 断る の は 忍び なかっ た。
    english_literally: Having come all the way from far, his request was difficult to refuse.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 遠い に も かかわら ず わざわざ 来 て くれ た が、彼 の 頼み を 断る の は 忍び なかっ た。
        english: Even though he came all the way from far, his request was difficult to refuse.
        hint: This sentence uses two 「ところを」 for emphasis. The first 「遠いところを」 highlights the distance traveled
          (a difficult circumstance), and the second 「来てくれたところを」 emphasizes the act of him coming. 「にもかかわらず」
          is just a general 'despite'. We want to highlight the specific situation.
    scene: A friend has traveled a great distance to meet you and asks for a favor.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The repetition of 「ところを」 amplifies the emphasis on the challenging circumstances the person
      overcame (traveling a long distance) and the specific act of their arrival, making it even harder
      for the speaker to refuse. 「遠いところを」 specifies the geographical challenge, and 「来てくれたところを」 highlights
      the effort of their visit itself.
  - english: Sorry to bother you while you're eating.
    japanese:
      - お 食事 中 の {ところ を}、恐れ入り ます。
      - 食事 中 の {ところ を}、すみ ませ ん。

          - お 食事 中 に、恐れ入り ます。
        english: Excuse me while you're eating.
        hint: 「〜中に」 is a more direct way to say 'during'. 「ところを」 adds a layer of politeness by acknowledging
          the specific, potentially inconvenient, act of eating. We are looking for an expression that
          conveys this consideration.
    scene: You need to speak to someone who is currently having a meal.

    competing_grammar:

          - 声 を かけよう と し た とき に、彼 は 姿 を 消し た。
        english: When I was about to call out to him, he disappeared.
        hint: 「ときに」 is a neutral temporal connector. 「ところを」 highlights the *precise moment* of attempting
          an action, emphasizing the missed opportunity or frustration.
    scene: You saw someone you knew and were just about to greet them, but they vanished.
    register: casual

      - 彼 自身 も 大変 な {ところ を}、助け て くれ て ありがとう。
      - あいつ も 大変 な {ところ を}、助け て くれ て マジ 感謝。
    english_literally: Even though he himself was in a difficult situation, I'm grateful for him helping
      me.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 自身 も 大変 だっ た が、助け て くれ て 感謝 し て い ます。
        english: He himself was difficult, but I'm grateful for him helping me.
        hint: This simple conjunction does not capture the nuance of helping *despite* being in a difficult
          situation. We're looking for an expression that points out the specific challenging circumstances.
    scene: Someone has provided assistance despite facing their own challenges.
    register: formal
    setting: pessimistic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of 「ところを」 here, especially with 「大変なところを」, emphasizes the speaker's recognition of
      the helper's own difficult circumstances. It's a way to express deeper gratitude, acknowledging
      the selflessness involved. This is a common way for both genders to express gratitude in such situations.
  - english: We deeply apologize for calling you during your precious break.
    japanese:
      - 貴重 な 休憩 中 の {ところ を}、誠 に 申し訳 ござい ませ ん。
      - 貴重 な 休憩 中 の {ところ を}、大変 申し訳 ござい ませ ん。
    english_literally: While you are in the middle of a precious break, we are truly sorry.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 貴重 な 休憩 中 に、誠 に 申し訳 ござい ませ ん。
        english: We are truly sorry during your precious break.
        hint: 「〜中に」 is simply 'during'. 「ところを」 enhances the apology by acknowledging the *sacredness*
          of the break and the imposition. We need a phrase that emphasizes the specific, valuable time
          being interrupted.
    scene: A company representative calls a customer during their lunch break.

  - english: I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation.

      - competing_japanese:
          - お 話 中 に 失礼 いたし ます。
        english: Excuse me while you're talking.
        hint: Similar to the previous example, 「〜中に」 is 'during'. 「ところを」 is more nuanced, specifically
          acknowledging the *act* of conversation and the imposition of interrupting it.
    scene: You need to interject into a conversation already in progress.

      - こんな 遅い {ところ を}、来 ちゃっ て ごめん。
    english_literally: While it is so late, I'm sorry to disturb you.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - こんな 遅い とき に、お 邪魔 し て 申し訳 あり ませ ん。
        english: I'm sorry to disturb you when it's so late.
        hint: 「ときに」 is a simpler 'when'. 「ところを」 highlights the specific, inconvenient *late hour* as the
          circumstance for the apology. We're looking for that emphasis on the specific time.
    scene: You arrive at someone's house much later than anticipated.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「こんな遅いところを」 specifically points out the lateness of the hour as the inconvenient
      circumstance, making the apology more pointed and sincere. This usage is common across age groups
      when expressing apologies for late visits.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 「ところを」 is highly versatile in expressing a specific
  context or timing. It often carries a nuance of politeness, apology, or recognition of effort, particularly
  when the second action might be an imposition or occur despite challenging circumstances. Pay attention
  to the preceding verb or adjective form, as it sets the scene for the following event, and the particle
  「を」 then highlights that particular moment or state as the 'point' of interaction.
