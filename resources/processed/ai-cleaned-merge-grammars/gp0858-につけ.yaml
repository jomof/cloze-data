        "[Verb (dictionary form)] + につけ": "Indicates that each time someone perceives something, they feel or think something associated with it.",

    },
    "etymology": "につけ is derived from に and the conjunctive form (連用形) of the verb 付ける (つける), meaning \"to attach\" or \"to affix\". Thus, literally, it implies something is \"attached\" to a particular event or occasion.",
    "writeup": "につけ implies that there is something that is \"affixed\" to the event or occasion. Unlike につき, this structure combines に and the conjunctive form of the る-Verb 付ける \"to affix\", or \"to adhere.\" When using につけ, the most common translation will be that something is happening \"every time (A)\" or \"whenever (A).\" In the (B) part of the sentence, the thoughts or feelings of the speaker are often expressed in relation to (A). Additionally, (B) is always something that is thought to happen naturally due to (A). This structure may appear with verbs or nouns in their dictionary forms. It is also possible to see につけて, but the abbreviated form is far more common. **Important:** This is considered a fairly old-fashioned grammar structure, so it will mostly only be seen in literature or shows that are emphasizing a specific time period.",
