    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from 「に」 (a particle indicating cause or reason) and 「つけ」, the conjunctive form of the verb 「付ける」 (tsukeru, to attach). It literally means 'attached to' or 'in connection with'. The nuance is that a certain feeling or thought is naturally *attached* to a particular event or situation.",
    "writeup": "Similar to 「につき」, 「につけ」 implies that something is 'affixed' to an event or occasion. However, unlike 「に就き」, this structure combines 「に」 with the conjunctive form of the verb 「付ける」, 'to affix' or 'to adhere'. When using 「につけ」, the most common translation is that something happens 'every (A)' or 'whenever (A)'. The (B) part of the sentence often expresses the speaker's thoughts or feelings about (A). Additionally, (B) is considered a natural consequence of (A). This structure can be used with verbs or nouns in their dictionary forms. It is also possible to see 「につけて」, but the abbreviated form is more common. **Important Consideration:** This is considered an old-fashioned grammar structure, primarily found in literature or shows emphasizing a specific time period.",
