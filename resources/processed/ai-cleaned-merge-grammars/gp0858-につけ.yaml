        "[Verb dictionary form] + {につけ}": "Used when a certain thought or feeling arises naturally every time the action of the verb occurs.",
        "[Noun] + {につけ}": "Used when a certain thought or feeling arises naturally every time the event or situation represented by the noun occurs.",

        "usage-context": "Used in formal or stiff contexts, often found in literature or when emphasizing an older style of expression.",
        "function": "Indicates that a certain thought or feeling is naturally elicited whenever a particular event or situation occurs.",
        "nuance": "Highlights a natural, almost automatic, emotional or cognitive response to a recurring event, implying a deeper, often introspective, connection between the trigger and the reaction."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from 「に」 (a particle indicating cause or reason) and 「つけ」, the conjunctive form of the verb 「付ける」 (tsukeru, to attach). It literally means 'attached to' or 'in connection with'. The nuance is that a certain feeling or thought is naturally *attached* to a particular event or situation.",
    "writeup": "「につけ」 implies that there is something 'affixed' to the event or occasion. This structure combines the particle 「に」 with the conjunctive form of the verb 「付ける」, meaning 'to affix' or 'to adhere'. When using 「につけ」, the most common translation is that something happens 'every (A)', or 'whenever (A)'. The second part of the sentence (B) often expresses the speaker's thoughts or feelings that arise in relation to (A). This (B) part is typically something that is understood to happen naturally due to (A).\n\nThis structure can be used with either verbs or nouns in their dictionary forms. It is also possible to see the longer form 「につけて」, but the abbreviated form 「につけ」 is far more common, especially in contemporary use, though the entire phrase is considered somewhat old-fashioned overall.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「につけ」 is considered a fairly old-fashioned grammar structure. It is primarily encountered in literature, essays, or historical dramas, rather than common everyday conversation.\n*   It often describes a deep, often emotional, reaction or realization that occurs consistently with a recurring event.\n*   The grammatical pattern often involves expressions of thought or feeling in the latter part of the sentence, such as 「思い出す」 (to recall), 「感じる」 (to feel), 「考える」 (to think), or internal reactions like sadness or relief.",
