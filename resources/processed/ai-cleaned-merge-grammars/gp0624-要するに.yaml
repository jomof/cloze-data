    "etymology": "「要するに」 is derived from the verb 「要する」 (yōsuru), meaning \"to require\" or \"to need,\" combined with the particle 「に」. The phrase evolved to mean \"in regard to what is essential or needed,\" eventually becoming an introductory phrase to summarize or get to the main point.",
    "writeup": "**要するに** is an expression in Japanese used to highlight important information, similar to \"to sum up,\" \"in summary,\" or \"in short\" in English. It is a combination of the する-Verb 「要する」 (yōsuru), meaning \"to need\" or \"to require,\" and the particle 「に」. Literally, it conveys something similar to \"as for what's necessary.\" This phrase consistently takes an initial position in a sentence, serving to introduce a condensed version of what has been previously discussed.",
