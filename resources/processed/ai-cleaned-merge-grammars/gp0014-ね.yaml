        "function": "sentence-ending particle, to invite agreement or shared sentiment",

    "etymology": "The particle 「ね」 doesn't have a clear etymological origin, but it's believed to have evolved from interjections or emphasis markers used in spoken Japanese to soften statements and seek agreement. It functions primarily as a pragmatic particle, focusing on the speaker's intention to connect with the listener.",
    "writeup": "「ね」 is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese, functioning similarly to English tag questions like \"right?\" or \"isn't it?\". Its primary use is to seek agreement or confirmation from the listener, indicating a shared understanding or expectation of agreement. You simply append 「ね」 to the end of a sentence.\n\nWhile 「ね」 and 「な」 are both sentence-ending particles, their nuances differ. 「ね」 is used when expressing a shared opinion or something you anticipate the listener will agree with. In contrast, 「な」 tends to focus more exclusively on the speaker's own thoughts or feelings.\n\nThe combination 「よね」 is frequently used when you have a strong expectation that the listener will agree with you.\n\nIt is important to note that 「ね」 is generally softer and less assertive than particles or phrases like 「でしょう」 or 「だろう」. It can sometimes be used purely out of habit, particularly in casual conversation, without carrying a strong nuance of seeking confirmation.",
