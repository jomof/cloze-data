    "etymology": "The particle 「ね」 doesn't have a clear etymological origin, but it's believed to have evolved from interjections or emphasis markers used in spoken Japanese to soften statements and seek agreement. It functions primarily as a pragmatic particle, focusing on the speaker's intention to connect with the listener.",
    "writeup": "「ね」 is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese used to seek agreement or confirmation from the listener. It's similar to saying \"right?\" or \"isn't it?\" in English. You simply add 「ね」 to the end of a statement. While 「ね」 is similar to 「な」, 「ね」 expresses a shared opinion while 「な」 focuses on the speaker's thoughts. 「よね」 is often used when you expect the listener to agree with you. Note that 「ね」 is weaker than 「でしょう」 or 「だろう」, and can sometimes be used habitually without much nuance.",
