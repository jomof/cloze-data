    "etymology": "The grammar point is derived from the combination of 「か」 (a question particle implying uncertainty), 「と」 (a particle indicating a thought or assumption), and 「思う」 (to think). 「思ったら」 or 「思うと」 indicates 'as soon as I thought' or 'just when I thought'. Thus, the whole expression implies that something happened contrary to what one expected or thought. It suggests a moment of realization followed by an immediate and often surprising or contradictory outcome.",
    "writeup": "When the adverbial particle 「か」 combines with 「と」, the う-verb 「思う」, and either the hypothetical markers 「たら」 or 「と」, it forms an expression indicating that something happened unexpectedly or contrary to one's thoughts or perceptions. It conveys a sense of \"just when I thought (A), (B) happened\" or \"no sooner than (A), (B)\". The nuance is that the second event (B) occurred quickly and often contrary to what was expected, or before (A) could be fully confirmed.\n\nThis phrase typically follows verbs in their dictionary or past forms, and also nouns. When the predicate in the second clause is non-emotive, the subjects in both clauses are typically the same. However, when the second clause expresses the speaker's feelings or an emotive state, the subject of the first clause might be different, or the phrase might express the speaker's personal realization.\n\nWhen following nouns, especially when the meaning focuses on the speaker's feelings about the first clause, 「なの」 (or 「の」 when used with verbs) may appear before 「かと思ったら/かと思うと」. Occasionally, the 「か」 may be omitted, resulting in 「と思うと」 or 「と思ったら」. While the meaning remains the same, this omission generally softens the expression.",
