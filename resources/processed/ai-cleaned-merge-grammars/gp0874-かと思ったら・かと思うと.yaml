    "etymology": "The grammar point is derived from the combination of 「か」 (a question particle), 「と」 (a particle indicating a thought or assumption), and 「思う」 (to think). 「思ったら」 or 「思うと」 indicates 'as soon as I thought' or 'just when I thought'. Thus, the whole expression implies that something happened contrary to what one expected or thought.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「かと思ったら」 or 「かと思うと」, expresses a sudden or unexpected change following an initial thought or perception. It conveys the feeling that 'just when I thought (A), (B) happened' or 'no sooner than (A), (B)'. The nuance is that the second event (B) occurred quickly and often contrary to what was expected. It is important to note that the subject of Sentence1 and Sentence2 are typically the same.\n\n*   「かと思ったら」 and 「かと思うと」 are interchangeable and can follow verbs in dictionary or past tense, as well as nouns.\n*   When following a noun and expressing the speaker's feelings, 「なの」 or 「の」 (when used with verbs) may be inserted.\n*   The 「か」 can be omitted, softening the expression, but this is less common.",
