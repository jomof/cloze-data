    "etymology": "以上 is composed of the kanji 以 (i), meaning \"by means of,\" and 上 (jō), meaning \"above.\" Together, they literally signify \"by means of above,\" indicating a quantity that meets or exceeds a specified value. Its secondary meaning of \"that's all\" or \"the end\" derives from a similar literal interpretation, meaning \"the things mentioned above are all.\"",
    "writeup": "以上 (ijō) is a crucial expression used to indicate that a quantity, value, or state is \"equal to or more than\" a specified point. It establishes a **minimum** threshold. When attached to an amount, it highlights this amount as the minimum requirement or quantity. For instance, 「100人以上」 means \"100 people or more.\" This usage combines the kanji 以 (i), meaning \"by means of,\" and 上 (jō), meaning \"above,\" literally conveying \"by means of being above.\" It can be broadly translated as \"more than,\" \"over,\" \"greater than,\" or \"exceeding,\" always with the understanding that the specified value itself is included.\n\nBeyond expressing minimum quantities, 以上 is also commonly used as a concluding statement, akin to \"that's all,\" \"the end,\" or \"nothing more.\" In this context, it literally means \"the above (list of things mentioned) is all.\" While saying \"the end\" might sound abrupt in English when concluding a list or an order, it is perfectly natural and polite in Japanese. This makes 以上 highly versatile, appearing in formal announcements, casual conversations, and transactional settings.",
