    "etymology": "以上 is composed of the kanji 以 (i), meaning \"by means of,\" and 上 (jō), meaning \"above.\" Together, they literally signify \"by means of above,\" indicating a quantity that meets or exceeds a specified value. Its secondary meaning of \"that's all\" or \"the end\" derives from a similar literal interpretation, meaning \"the above (list of things mentioned) is all.\"",
    "writeup": "以上 (ijō) is a crucial and versatile Japanese expression. It primarily functions in two distinct ways:\n\n1.  **\"More than or equal to\" / \"At least\"**: When 以上 is attached to a quantity, value, or number, it sets a **minimum threshold**, including the specified amount itself. For example, 「100人以上」 (hyakunin ijō) means \"100 people or more.\" This usage combines the kanji 以 (i), meaning \"by means of,\" and 上 (jō), meaning \"above,\" literally conveying \"by means of being above or at this level.\" It can be translated as \"more than,\" \"over,\" \"greater than,\" or \"exceeding,\" always with the understanding that the specified value is included.\n\n2.  **\"That's all\" / \"The end\" / \"Nothing more\"**: In this context, 以上 is used as a concluding statement, signifying that a list, explanation, or request is complete. It often appears as 「以上です」 (ijō desu) or 「以上になります」 (ijō ni narimasu). This usage literally means \"the above (list of things mentioned) is all.\" While saying \"the end\" might sound abrupt or demanding in English when concluding a list or an order, it is perfectly natural, polite, and common in Japanese business settings, presentations, and transactional situations.",
