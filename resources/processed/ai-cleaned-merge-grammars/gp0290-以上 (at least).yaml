    "etymology": "以上 is composed of the kanji 以 (i), meaning \"by means of,\" and 上 (jō), meaning \"above.\" Together, they literally signify \"by means of above,\" indicating a quantity that meets or exceeds a specified value.",
    "writeup": "以上 (ijō) is used to indicate that a quantity is \"equal to or more than\" a given value. Think of it as establishing a **minimum** threshold.  It combines the kanji 以 (i), meaning \"by means of,\" and 上 (jō), meaning \"above.\" It can also mean \"that's all\" or \"the end,\" often used to conclude a list or an order. Though saying \"the end\" might sound abrupt in English, it's perfectly natural in Japanese in this context.",
