    "etymology": "以上 (ijō) is composed of two kanji: 以 (i), meaning \"by means of\" or \"because of,\" and 上 (jō), meaning \"above\" or \"on top.\" Together, they literally signify \"that which is above [a certain point],\" indicating a quantity or level that is at least as high as the point in question.",
    "writeup": "以上 (ijō) is used to indicate that something is equal to or greater than a specified amount. It combines the kanji 以 (meaning \"by means of\") and 上 (meaning \"above\"). The expression can be translated as \"greater than or equal to,\" \"over,\" or \"exceeding.\"  It's attached directly to the amount to set the minimum threshold.  以上 is also commonly used to mean \"that's all\" or \"the end,\" signaling the conclusion of a list or statement. Using it in this context is natural in Japanese and doesn't carry the potential rudeness that \"the end\" might in English.",
