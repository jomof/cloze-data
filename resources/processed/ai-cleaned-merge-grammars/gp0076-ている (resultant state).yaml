    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ている」 is formed by combining the te-form 「て」 of a verb with the auxiliary verb 「いる」, which means \"to exist\" or \"to be\". This combination creates a sense of ongoing action or a state resulting from a previous action.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「ている」, indicates that something is in a state resulting from a previous action. Think of it as \"existing in a state of (A) having been done\". In English, these verbs would often be in the past form, but in Japanese, the focus is on the *current state* resulting from the action. For example, something that has \"started\" exists in the state of being ongoing; something that has \"died\" exists in the state of being dead. \n\nOne way to differentiate between using 「ている」 and the past form is to consider whether the action can happen multiple times. If an action can't be repeated (like \"starting\" or \"dying\"), 「ている」 is often used. A piano can only fall once; therefore you'd use 「落ちている」.",
