    "etymology": "The 「て」 form indicates a connection or sequence, while 「いる」 signifies existence or a continuing state. Combined, they describe something that continues from a past action to the present.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「ている」, indicates a **resultant state**. This means something has happened, and its effect continues to exist. It describes something that *has* been done and is *still* in that state. It's crucial to differentiate this from the 「ている」 form that indicates an ongoing action. This form highlights the *current state* resulting from a completed action, rather than the action itself. It's similar to the English past perfect tense, but it focuses on the resulting condition.\n\nVerbs that describe a change that is instantaneous and whose result persists often use this form. For instance, actions like 'to die' (死ぬ), 'to break' (壊れる), 'to turn on' (つく), or 'to fall' (落ちる) inherently describe a single, completed event. Once that event occurs, the resultant state continues. You cannot 'die' twice in succession, nor can something 'break' twice without first being fixed. Therefore, when these verbs are used with 「ている」, they describe the *state* that exists as a consequence of that single, completed action.",
