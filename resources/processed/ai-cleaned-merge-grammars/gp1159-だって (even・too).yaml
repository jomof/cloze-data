details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express emphasis on inclusion ('even'), to present an unexpected item, or to
    provide a reason/justification for an action or statement, often with a slightly defensive or complaining
    tone.
  function: Emphasis, inclusion, explanation, justification, mild complaint or exasperation.
  nuance: Carries a nuance of 'even' or 'too,' highlighting that something applies to an unexpected item.
    When used to introduce a reason, it often implies that the reason should be obvious or is being given
    with a slight sense of complaint or defiance. It can also suggest 'obviously' or 'naturally.'
etymology: The particle 「だって」 is widely considered to have evolved from a contraction of 「だ と いって」 (da
  to itte), meaning 'saying that it is' or 'even saying that it is'. The 'to itte' (と 言って) component,
  meaning 'saying and', lends itself to providing a reason or explanation. Over time, this evolved to
  emphasize inclusion ('even') or to provide a justification with a nuanced 'because' or 'but' that often
  carries a sense of obviousness or mild exasperation.
writeup: 「だって」 is a versatile particle in Japanese, primarily used to add emphasis, express inclusion,
  or provide a reason with a specific nuance. Its core meaning revolves around the idea of 'even' or 'too,'
  but it frequently carries a subtle emotional undertone.When 「だって」 follows a noun, verb, or adjective
  in its plain form, it indicates that 'even' that particular item or condition applies. For instance,
  if someone says 「子供だってわかる」 (Kodomo datte wakaru), it means 'Even a child can understand,' highlighting
  the unexpected capability of a child. This usage emphasizes that the statement extends to or includes
  the mentioned subject, often implying a surprising or self-evident fact.Another very common use of 「だって」
  is at the beginning of a sentence or clause. In this context, it functions much like 'Because...' or
  'But...' in English, providing a reason or justification. However, it's not a neutral 'because' like
  「から」 or 「ので」. Instead, it often carries a nuance of mild complaint, defiance, or exasperation. It's
  as if the speaker is saying, 'But it's obvious why!' or 'Don't you see, the reason is...' For example,
  if asked why you're late, responding with 「だって、電車が遅れたんだもん」 (Datte, densha ga okureta n da mon) implies
  'Because, you see, the train was delayed! (and it's not my fault/you should know).' This makes it highly
  conversational and often used in casual settings.While 「だって」 can convey 'even,' its usage differs from
  similar particles like 「でも」, 「さえ」, or 「すら」. 「でも」 is a more general 'even' or 'any.' 「さえ」 often focuses
  on a minimum condition ('if only X, then Y'). 「すら」 is more formal and used for surprising inclusions,
  often in negative statements. 「だって」, in contrast, leans into a more personal, sometimes slightly argumentative
  or self-justifying tone when providing reasons.

    meaning: Even; or something; any (with question words); no matter (who/what/where/when)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だって」 emphasizes the unexpectedness or obviousness of the inclusion, often implying a reason
      or slight complaint. 「でも」 is a more neutral 'even' or 'any,' used for broader inclusion or offering
      alternatives.
    grammar_point: でも (even・any・no matter)
  - term: さえ
    meaning: Even; if only; as long as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だって」 emphasizes inclusion or a reason, often with a slight emotional tone. 「さえ」 focuses on
      a minimal condition required for something to happen ('if only X') or a surprising extreme inclusion.
    grammar_point: さえ (even・if only)
  - term: すら
    meaning: Even
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だって」 is more colloquial and can carry a nuance of complaint or obviousness. 「すら」 is more
      formal and emphasizes an extreme or surprising inclusion, often in negative sentences, implying
      'not even this basic thing'.
    grammar_point: すら (even)
  - term: だって (hearsay)
    meaning: I heard that; I'm not sure, but; Apparently
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This 「だって」 is a casual way to report hearsay, functioning as a conjunction or sentence-final
      particle. It conveys reported information and does not carry the emphasizing or explanatory nuance
      of the current grammar point.
    grammar_point: んだって (I heard, casual)
post_false_friends_writeup: Although 「だって」 shares the meaning of 'even' with 「でも」, 「さえ」, and 「すら」, its
  most distinct feature is its ability to introduce a reason or justification with a tone of defensiveness
  or mild complaint. This differentiates it significantly from the other 'even' particles, which are typically
  neutral in their inclusive function. Furthermore, the homophonous 「だって」 for hearsay has an entirely
  different function of reporting information, so context is key to distinguish these two.
examples:
  - english: Even a child can understand this simple rule.
    japanese:
      - こんな 簡単 な ルール、子供 {だ って} わかる よ。
      - こんな 簡単 な ルール、子供 {だ って} 分かり ます よ。
    english_literally: This simple rule, even a child understands.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - こんな 簡単 な ルール は 子供 で も わかる よ。
        english: This simple rule, even a child understands (using でも for a more general 'even').
        hint: While 「でも」 also means 'even', 「だって」 here specifically highlights the child as an unexpected
          inclusion, suggesting the rule is *so* simple. We're looking for that specific nuance of 'even
          (this unexpected example)'.

        english: Even I was surprised by that news (using でも for a general 'even').
        hint: 「でも」 implies 'even' in a general sense. 「だって」 here conveys a stronger 'even *I* (who might

      - competing_japanese:
          - 難しかっ た から！
        english: Because it was difficult!
        hint: 「から」 simply states a reason. 「だって」 adds a nuance of complaint or defense, implying the reason
          should be obvious. We're looking for an excuse with a slightly whining tone.
    scene: A child is being scolded for not finishing homework and offers an excuse.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic

        english: Even on weekends, I have to study (using でも).
        hint: 「でも」 is a general 'even'. 「だって」 suggests a stronger emphasis on the weekend as an unexpected
          time for study, perhaps implying a complaint. We're looking for that emphatic 'even' for the
          weekend.

          - 私 に は 無理 だ から！
        english: Because it's impossible for me! (using から for a neutral reason)

          implying the speaker feels misunderstood. We're looking for that frustrated justification.
    scene: A person refusing to do something challenging, expressing their inability with frustration.
    register: casual

        english: Even if you say that, I still can't agree (using と言っても).
        hint: 「と言っても」 means 'even if you say'. While similar, 「だって」 here puts a stronger emphasis on 'even
          (what) you say' as the reason for disagreement, often with a slightly more confrontational nuance.
          We're looking for that specific nuance of 'even *that* statement'.

          - 私、何 も 言っ て ない けど！
        english: I didn't say anything, but!
        hint: 「けど」 connects clauses. 「だって」 functions as a strong interjection for self-defense or denial,
          implying 'it's not fair that you think I said something'. We're looking for that emphatic, defensive
          opening.

        english: Even an expert would find this difficult (using でも).
        hint: 「でも」 is a common way to say 'even'. 「だって」 here puts a stronger, slightly more surprising
          emphasis on the expert being included among those who struggle. We're looking for that particular
          highlight on the unexpected inclusion.
    scene: Two people discussing a complex problem.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 常識 だ から！
        english: Because it's common sense!
        hint: 「だから」 states a neutral reason. 「だって」 injects an emotional tone, implying frustration that
          the reason needs to be stated at all. We're looking for an exasperated or 'should be obvious'
          tone.
    scene: Someone reacting to another person's ignorance about a well-known fact.
    register: casual
    setting: excited

    japanese:
      - プロ の ダンサー {だ って} その 動き は 苦労 する だろう。
      - プロ の ダンサー {だ って} その 動き は 苦労 する でしょう。

          - プロ の ダンサー で も その 動き は 苦労 する だろう。
        english: Even a professional dancer would struggle with that move (using でも).
        hint: While 「でも」 is a general 'even', 「だって」 emphasizes the surprising inclusion of a professional
          among those who'd struggle, making the point stronger. We're looking for that specific emphasis
          on the professional.
    scene: A dance instructor explaining the difficulty of a particular move.

        english: I can't go because I have work tomorrow (using から for a neutral reason).
        hint: 「から」 provides a straightforward reason. 「だって」 here adds a subtle nuance of regret or slight
          complaint about having to explain, common in casual excuses. We're looking for that apologetic/complaining
          tone.
    scene: Declining an invitation, giving a reason with a slightly apologetic/complaining tone.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: This usage of 「だって」 introduces a reason for declining, softened by the 「もん」. It's a casual
      way to explain a situation while implying a bit of disappointment or resignation.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「だって」 serves multiple functions that often overlap, primarily
  revolving around emphasis and providing reasons. It can stand alone at the beginning of a sentence to
  introduce a justification, or it can follow nouns, verbs, or adjectives to highlight unexpected inclusivity.
  Pay close attention to the context and the speaker's tone, as 「だって」 frequently conveys emotion, such
  as mild complaint, defensiveness, or a sense that the given reason is self-evident.
