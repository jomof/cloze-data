meaning: until (an action or state continues)
pronunciation:
  katakana: マデ
  romaji: made
formation:
  Verb[dictionary form] + まで: Indicates that an action or state continues up to the point where the specified
    verb's action or state begins.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  usage-context: Used to show that something continues up to the moment another action occurs or a certain
    state is reached.
  function: Indicates the termination point of an action or state.
  nuance: Emphasizes the duration or continuation of an action/state until a specific event. It implies
    that the first action/state stops at or just before the second action/state.
  grammatical-role: Connects a preceding verb phrase to indicate a temporal limit.
  temporal-flow: The preceding action/state continues, then stops when the action described by the verb
    attached to まで occurs.
etymology: The particle まで fundamentally signifies a limit or an endpoint, either spatially ("up to,"
  "as far as") or temporally ("until," "by"). When combined with a verb in its dictionary form, it specifies
  that the action or state described by the main clause continues until the action of the dictionary-form
  verb takes place. This usage evolved from its core meaning of indicating a boundary, applying it to
  the completion or commencement of an event.
writeup: The grammatical pattern `Verb[dictionary form]まで` is used to express that an action or state
  continues **until** another action occurs or a certain state is reached. It explicitly marks the point
  at which the first action/state ceases. This contrasts with other temporal expressions by focusing on
  the *continuation up to* a boundary event rather than the duration itself or an action *after* a point.
  For instance, if you say 「駅に着く{まで}歩きました」 (I walked until I reached the station), it means the action
  of "walking" continued without interruption until the moment "reaching the station" happened, at which
  point the walking stopped. It implies a direct cessation of the first action *due to* the occurrence
  of the second.

  - term: までに
    meaning: by the time (a deadline)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`までに` indicates a deadline or a point *by which* an action must be completed. The action
      usually occurs *before* or *at* that point, but doesn''t necessarily continue *until* it. `[Verb-dictionary]まで`
      means the action continues *up until* that point.'
    grammar_point: までに (by the time)
  - term: Verb[て]から
    meaning: after doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`Verb[て]から` describes an action that happens *after* another action is completed. `[Verb-dictionary]まで`
      indicates an action that continues *until* another action starts.'
    grammar_point: てから (after and since)
  - term: Verb[ない]うちに
    meaning: before (something changes or happens)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`Verb[ない]うちに` expresses doing something *before* a certain state changes or an opportunity
      is lost. It emphasizes acting proactively before a negative outcome or a missed chance. `[Verb-dictionary]まで`
      emphasizes the continuation *up to* the point where something happens.'
    grammar_point: '[Verb-ない]うちに (before something changes)'
  - term: Noun まで
    meaning: until (a noun)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the particle まで used with a noun, indicating a limit for a noun. `[Verb-dictionary]まで`
      specifies the limit using a verb, meaning "until the *action* described by the verb." Conceptually
      similar, but grammatically different.
    grammar_point: まで (limit extent)
post_false_friends_writeup: While `[Verb-dictionary]まで` focuses on the continuation of an action *up to*
  a specified point, `までに` denotes a deadline, `Verb[て]から` describes sequential actions, and `Verb[ない]うちに`
  emphasizes acting before a state changes. Understanding these subtle distinctions is key to using them
  correctly.
