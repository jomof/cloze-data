jlpt: N1
etymology: The phrase 「思 いき や」 originates from a combination of 「思う」 (omou, to think or expect) and the
  classical particle 「きや」. The 「き」 is an auxiliary verb indicating past tense or perfective aspect, and
  「や」 is an interrogative particle. Together, 「きや」 historically formed questions expressing doubt or rhetorical
  surprise, akin to 'Did I really think...?' or 'Was it really...?' When combined with 「思う」, it evolved
  to convey 'I thought X, but (was it so? / no, it wasn't)' leading to its current meaning of an unexpected
  or contrary outcome.
writeup: The grammar point 「思 いき や」 is used to express a strong sense of surprise, disappointment, or
  irony when an expected outcome is completely reversed or something entirely unexpected happens. It functions
  like "I thought X, but to my surprise, Y happened instead" or "Just when I thought X, it turned out
  to be Y." This expression is typically used to highlight a significant deviation from an expectation
  the speaker (or the subject of the sentence) held. It often carries a nuance of "thwarted expectation."
  While commonly encountered in written Japanese, particularly in narratives, essays, or news articles,
  it can also be used in spoken language for dramatic effect, to emphasize the speaker's astonishment.
  It almost always follows the plain form of a verb, い-adjective, な-adjective (without だ or replacing
  with な), or a noun + だ. The clause preceding 「思 いき や」 sets up the expectation, and the clause following
  it presents the unexpected reality. The emotional impact of 「思 いき や」 is stronger than simple conjunctions
  like 「しかし」 (but) or 「けれども」 (although), as it specifically introduces an an element of surprise or contradiction
  to a held belief.

    meaning: Just when I thought; no sooner than; then again
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both express unexpectedness, 「かと思ったら・かと思うと」 typically refers to a rapid and unexpected
      succession of events, implying "as soon as X happened, Y happened immediately," often without an
      an explicit initial thought or expectation being contradicted. 「思 いき や」 emphasizes the direct contradiction
      of a mental expectation.
    grammar_point: かと思ったら・かと思うと (unexpected succession)
  - term: にもかかわらず
    meaning: Despite; in spite of; regardless
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にもかかわらず」 means "despite X, Y happened," where Y occurs regardless of X. 「思 いき や」 means "I
      expected X, but Y happened instead," focusing on the surprising reversal of the expectation.

  - term: だが
    meaning: But; however
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だが」 is a general formal conjunction introducing a contrast. It lacks the strong sense of
      personal expectation being overturned that 「思 いき や」 carries.
    grammar_point: しかし (but・however)
  - term: しかしながら
    meaning: However; nevertheless
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「しかしながら」 is a general formal conjunction introducing a contrast. It lacks the strong sense
      of personal expectation being overturned that 「思 いき や」 carries. It is more formal than 「だが」.
    grammar_point: しかし (but・however)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「思 いき や」 and similar expressions, consider whether the
  primary emphasis is on a personal expectation being dramatically contradicted. If the focus is simply
  on presenting contrasting information or a rapid sequence of events, other conjunctions like 「ところが」
  or 「かと思ったら」 might be more appropriate. 「思 いき や」 specifically highlights the surprise or irony felt when
  reality diverges sharply from what was thought or predicted.
