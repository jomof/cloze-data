    "etymology": "「だった」 and 「でした」 are the past tense forms of the copula 「だ」 and its polite form 「です」. They are formed by adding 「た」 (the past tense auxiliary verb) to 「だ」, resulting in 「だった」, and by changing 「す」 to 「し」 before adding 「た」 to 「です」, resulting in 「でした」.",
    "writeup": "「だった」 (casual) and 「でした」 (polite) are used to express the past tense of nouns and *na*-adjectives. They indicate that something \"was\" a certain way in the past. Think of it as the past tense of 「だ」 (casual) and 「です」 (polite).  They are formed by combining 「だ」 or 「です」 with 「た」.  However, note that *i*-adjectives have their own past tense conjugations and cannot be used with 「だった」 or 「でした」.",
