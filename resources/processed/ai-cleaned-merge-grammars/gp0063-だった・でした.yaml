    "etymology": "「だった」 and 「でした」 are the past tense forms of the copula 「だ」 and its polite form 「です」. They are formed by adding 「た」 (the past tense auxiliary verb) to 「だ」, resulting in 「だった」, and by changing 「す」 to 「し」 before adding 「た」 to 「です」, resulting in 「でした」.",
    "writeup": "「だった」 (casual) and 「でした」 (polite) are auxiliary verbs used to express the past tense of nouns and な-adjectives. They indicate that something \"was\" or \"were\" a certain way in the past. Essentially, they function as the past tense forms of the copula 「だ」 (casual) and its polite counterpart 「です」.\n\nThe formation is straightforward:\n*   For **nouns**, you directly attach 「だった」 for casual speech or 「でした」 for polite speech. For example, 「学生」 (student) becomes 「学生だった」 (was a student, casual) or 「学生でした」 (was a student, polite).\n*   For **な-adjectives**, you also directly attach 「だった」 or 「でした」. For example, 「親切」 (kind) becomes 「親切だった」 (was kind, casual) or 「親切でした」 (was kind, polite).\n\n**Important Note:** It is crucial to remember that 「だった」 and 「でした」 **cannot** be used with い-adjectives. い-adjectives have their own distinct past tense conjugation rules (e.g., 「暑い」 (hot) becomes 「暑かった」 (was hot), not 「暑いだった」).",
