jlpt: N4
etymology: The particle に has ancient origins, evolving from a locative marker to indicate a point of
  arrival, purpose, time, and eventually, the agent or source. Its core sense of "point of contact" or
  "direction towards" extended to marking the origin of an action (agent) or a transfer (source).
writeup: に is a versatile particle in Japanese, carrying various meanings depending on context. When used
  to mark the agent of a passive verb, it directly answers "by whom" or "by what." For instance, in sentences
  like 「先生 {に} 褒められた」 (I was praised by the teacher), 先生に specifies the agent of the praising action.
  This usage is crucial for understanding passive constructions, which are quite common in Japanese. Additionally,
  に designates the source in verbs related to giving, receiving, or being affected by an action. For example,
  「友達 {に} 本を借りた」 (I borrowed a book from a friend) uses 友達に to indicate the source from whom the book
  was borrowed. This function extends to various verbs like teach (教える), ask (聞く), and receive (もらう).
  The key is that に pinpoints the origin of an action or transfer, making it a critical particle for expressing
  such relationships in sentences.

  - term: が (subject marker)
    meaning: Indicates the subject of a verb.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While が marks the subject of an active sentence, {に} marks the agent of a passive sentence.
      The subject of a passive sentence is the recipient of the action, marked by が.
    grammar_point: が (subject marker)
  - term: から (from)
    meaning: Indicates a starting point, source, or cause.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Both {に} and {から} can indicate a source. {に} is often used with verbs of giving/receiving
      to indicate the direct person/entity from whom one receives. {から} emphasizes the point of origin,
      often used for inanimate sources or broader origins, or when the transfer is indirect (e.g., received
      information from a company 「会社 から」).
    grammar_point: から (from)
  - term: で (means・method)
    meaning: Indicates the means, method, or cause.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While {に} marks the agent of a passive action (by someone), {で} can mark the tool or material
      used for an action (by means of something inanimate). For example, 「鉛筆 {で} 書く」 (write with a pencil)
      uses {で} for the tool.
    grammar_point: で (means・method)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the nuanced differences between {に} (agent・source) and other
  particles like {が}, {から}, and {で} is crucial for precise communication. Remember that {に} specifically
  identifies the active agent in a passive construction, or the direct personal source of receiving. {から}
  is broader for origins, and {で} is for instruments or means. Mastering these distinctions will significantly
  enhance your ability to express complex ideas accurately.

post_example_writeup: 'The examples illustrate how {に} functions both to mark the agent in passive constructions,
  encompassing both animate and inanimate agents, and to indicate the source from which an action or item
  is received. The choice between {に} and {から} for ''source'' often comes down to nuance: {に} often implies
  a more direct or personal interaction with the source, especially with verbs of giving/receiving, while
  {から} can indicate a broader or more indirect origin. Similarly, for inanimate agents in passive sentences,
  {によって} (which typically follows {に}) is often preferred for more formal or large-scale events, while
  {で} is used for tools or means.'
