jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  particle-syntactic-function: passive-agent
  usage-context: Used widely across all registers, particularly when specifying the performer of an action
    in a passive construction or the origin of a benefit.
  function: To clearly mark the agent of the action (especially in passive voice) or the source of receiving/giving.
  nuance: When marking the agent in passive sentences, に often highlights the person or entity directly
    responsible for the action. In receiving contexts, it identifies the giver.
  grammatical-role: Marks the agent of the action in passive and causative-passive sentences, or the source
    of an action (like receiving/giving) from a person or entity.
etymology: The particle に has deep roots in Old Japanese, deriving from a locative sense of 'at' or 'to'.
  This fundamental meaning extended to denote the point of origin or the entity from which an action proceeds.
  For instance, in passive constructions, the action 'comes from' the agent, and when receiving, the object
  'comes from' the giver. This underlying concept of origin or source connects its diverse functions,
  including marking the agent of a passive verb or the source of a benefit.
writeup: |-
  The particle に serves a crucial role in Japanese grammar by marking the agent of an action, particularly in passive and causative-passive constructions. While passive sentences in English often omit the agent (e.g., 'The door was opened'), Japanese typically requires specifying the agent using に. This emphasizes who or what performed the action even when the grammatical focus is on the recipient of the action.

  In passive sentences (受身形, ukemi-kei), the agent (the one who performs the action) is marked by に. For example, 「先生 に 褒められた」 (sensei ni homerareta) means 'I was praised by the teacher'. Here, 先生 (teacher) is the agent of the praising action.

  Similarly, in causative-passive sentences (使役受身形, shieki-ukemi-kei), に marks the person who is forced or allowed to do something. For instance, 「母 に 宿題をさせられた」 (haha ni shukudai o saserareta) means 'I was made to do homework by my mother'. Here, 母 (mother) is the agent who caused the action.

  Beyond passive and causative-passive, に also marks the source from which a benefit or item is received, especially with verbs like もらう (morau - to receive), 習う (narau - to learn), or 聞く (kiku - to ask/hear). For example, 「友達 に プレゼントを もらった」 (tomodachi ni purezento o moratta) means 'I received a present from a friend'. In this case, 友達 (friend) is the source of the present. This usage of に clearly indicates the origin of the received item or action, often implying a personal interaction.

  - term: によって・による・により
    meaning: By means of; due to; by (impersonal agent)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While に marks a specific agent (especially in passive voice or for receiving from a person),
      によって is typically used for inanimate agents, abstract concepts, or as a general means/method. For
      example, 「地震 によって 建物が壊された」 (jishin ni yotte tatemono ga kowasareta) 'The building was destroyed
      by an earthquake'. Here, 地震 (earthquake) is an impersonal agent, so によって is used instead of に. によって
      can also mean 'according to' or 'depending on'.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]によって (means・method)'
  - term: から
    meaning: From (source, origin, starting point)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both に and から can indicate a source. However, から more broadly indicates a point of origin,
      such as the starting point of a movement (e.g., 「東京 から 来た」 - Tokyo kara kita - 'came from Tokyo'),
      the material something is made from (e.g., 「牛乳 から チーズを作る」 - gyūnyū kara chīzu o tsukuru - 'make
      cheese from milk'), or the cause/reason for something. In contrast, に is specifically used for the
      agent in passive/causative-passive constructions, or the direct personal source of receiving a benefit
      or action.
    grammar_point: から (from)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the subtle differences between に, によって, and から when indicating
  sources or agents is key to natural Japanese. Remember that に is highly personal for agents in passive
  and for givers in receiving actions, while によって handles non-personal agents or means, and から focuses
  on more general origins or causes.
examples:
  - english: I was praised by the teacher.
    japanese:
      - 先生 に 褒め られ まし た。
      - 先生 に 褒め られ た。
      - 先生 に お 褒め いただき まし た。
    english_literally: Teacher by praised was.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 に よっ て 褒め られ まし た。
        english: I was praised by the teacher (implying a more formal or detached context).
        hint: While technically possible, によって for a personal agent like 'teacher' can sound a bit stiff
          or imply a more indirect influence. We're looking for the direct personal agent.
    scene: You are recalling a positive experience at school.

    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
  - english: My mother made me eat vegetables.
    japanese:
      - 母 に 野菜 を 食べ させ られ まし た。
      - 母 に 野菜 を 食べ させ られ た。
      - 母 に 野菜 食わさ れ た。
    english_literally: Mother by vegetables made to eat was.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 母 に 野菜 を 食べ させ まし た。
        english: My mother made (someone else) eat vegetables.
        hint: This sentence is causative, not causative-passive. We're looking for the structure where
          the subject 'I' am forced to do something.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 母 に よっ て 野菜 を 食べ させ られ まし た。
        english: I was made to eat vegetables by my mother (implying a more formal/distant cause).
        hint: Using によって here implies a less direct or more abstract 'by means of' rather than a direct
          personal agent. We need the direct agent marking particle.
    scene: You are complaining to a friend about your childhood.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: causative-passive (～させられる)
  - english: I received a present from my younger sister.
    japanese:
      - 妹 に プレゼント を もらい まし た。
      - 妹 に プレゼント を もらっ た。
    english_literally: Younger sister from present received.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 妹 から プレゼント を もらい まし た。
        english: I received a present from my younger sister (emphasizing the starting point).
        hint: から can indicate a source, but に is generally used when receiving something directly from
          a person, especially a benefit. We're looking for the direct personal source.
    scene: You are excitedly telling your friend about a recent gift.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of に emphasizes that the present was received directly from the younger sister. While
      から is also possible here, 「妹 に」 naturally marks the person who gave the gift, indicating a direct
      personal interaction. The polite form 「もらいました」 fits the friendly but polite conversation context
      between female friends.
  - english: The child was bitten by a dog.
    japanese:
      - 子供 は 犬 に 噛ま れ まし た。
      - 子供 は 犬 に 噛ま れ た。
    english_literally: Child dog by bitten was.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 は 犬 に よっ て 噛ま れ まし た。
        english: The child was bitten by the dog (sounding more formal or like a news report).
        hint: While によって can be used for animals, に is more common for direct agents, even animals, in
          common passive constructions. We're looking for the standard direct agent marker.
    scene: A concerned parent is explaining an incident to a neighbor.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: passive (～られる/～かれる)
  - english: He was forced to transfer schools by his parents.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 両親 に よっ て 転校 さ せ られ まし た。
        english: He was forced to transfer schools due to his parents (implying parental influence rather
          than direct command).
        hint: によって would imply the transfer happened due to the parents' circumstances or general influence
          rather than their direct will. We need the direct agent of the 'forcing' action.
    scene: A friend is explaining why their mutual acquaintance moved away.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: causative-passive (～させられる)
  - english: I was touched by his kindness.

        english: I was moved by his kindness (implying the kindness as a means, not a direct agent).
        hint: When the 'agent' is an abstract quality or emotion that directly affects you, に is the natural
          particle. によって would be less direct, suggesting 'by means of' the kindness.
    scene: You are expressing gratitude to a third party about a person's actions.

          - 祖父 から この 時計 を もらい まし た。
        english: I received this watch from my grandfather (emphasizing the origin).
        hint: Both are grammatically correct for receiving, but に is often preferred when the giver is
          a person and the act of giving is a direct interaction or benefaction. We're looking for the
          particle that directly marks the personal giver.
    scene: You are showing off a cherished family heirloom.

          - その 決定 は 彼 に よっ て 任さ れ まし た。
        english: The decision was entrusted by means of him (implies he was the means of entrustment).
        hint: When marking the person to whom something is entrusted in a passive construction, に is the
          appropriate particle, not によって.

    english_literally: Native speaker by English taught was.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ネイティブ スピーカー から 英語 を 教わり まし た。
        english: I learned English from a native speaker (emphasizing the origin of the knowledge).
        hint: Both are often interchangeable with verbs like 教わる (to be taught/learn from), but に focuses
          on the direct agent from whom the learning or teaching occurred. We need the agent marker.
    scene: You are discussing your language learning journey.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
post_example_writeup: The versatility of に as an agent or source marker means it's frequently encountered
  in daily conversation and formal writing. Paying close attention to the verb it accompanies (passive,
  causative-passive, or verbs of giving/receiving) is key to accurately understanding its function in
  a sentence.
