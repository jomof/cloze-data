    "etymology": "The term 「あげく」originally comes from the final line of a 「連歌(れんが)」 (renga, a form of early Japanese poetry), and literally means \"the tying up phrase\" or \"the concluding phrase.\"",
    "writeup": "「あげく」, also written as 「挙げ句」or 「挙句」, is a noun that expresses a negative result occurring after a considerable amount of time, effort, or resources have been invested. It often implies that the preceding events somehow caused or contributed to the negative outcome. It suggests a culmination of events leading to an undesirable conclusion.\n\nIt is used after the past-tense form of verbs or after nouns followed by 「の」. While often written in hiragana, the kanji forms are also common.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「あげく」 typically implies a negative or undesirable outcome. While it can be used when the outcome is not inherently negative, it still suggests that the process leading to that result was somehow troublesome or involved negative aspects.",
