        "Function": "Indicates an uncertain or hearsay reason.",
        "Nuance": "Expresses that the reason provided is based on hearsay or is not definitively known by the speaker."
    },
    "etymology": "「とか」 is used to list non-exhaustive examples, and 「で」 indicates a reason or cause. Together, 「とかで」 suggests that the reason given is one of several possibilities or is based on indirect information.",
    "writeup": "「とかで」 is used to indicate a reason or cause that is uncertain, based on hearsay, or presented as just one possibility among others. It conveys a sense of vagueness or indirectness about the reason being given. It's similar to saying \"I heard that...\" or \"supposedly because...\" You can also use 「とかで」 to introduce a suggestion or a possible reason when you're not entirely sure about it. It is primarily used in casual speech.",

                    "mitigation": "Using 「ので」 would imply the speaker has direct, confirmed knowledge of Tanaka's illness. The scene, indicating information is passed about an absent colleague, suggests a more uncertain or indirectly received reason, making 「とかで」 more appropriate."

                    "competing_grammar": "田中さんは病気だから、今日は来ません。",
