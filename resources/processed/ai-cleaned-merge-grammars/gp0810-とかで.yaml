It conveys a sense of vagueness or indirectness about the reason being given. It's similar to saying \"I heard that...\" or \"supposedly because...\" You can also use 「とかで」 to introduce a suggestion or a possible reason when you're not entirely sure about it. It is primarily used in casual speech.",
