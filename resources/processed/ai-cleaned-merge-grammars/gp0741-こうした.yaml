        "nuance": "Implies that the speaker is referencing a specific instance or type that has already been presented or discussed.",
        "colocation": "Often precedes nouns like 問題 (mondai - problem), 行為 (kōi - act), 経験 (keiken - experience), 話 (hanashi - story), デザイン (dezain - design), 努力 (doryoku - effort), 関係 (kankei - relationship).",

    },
    "etymology": "「こう」 (kou) means \"this way\" or \"like this\". 「した」 (shita) is the past tense form of the verb 「する」 (suru), which means \"to do\". Therefore, 「こうした」 literally means \"did like this\" or \"happened like this\", implying a preceding action or example that sets the context for the current reference.",
    "writeup": "「こうした」 is a demonstrative adjective that means \"like this\" or \"such\". It is primarily used to refer to a specific type, kind, or example that has already been mentioned, demonstrated, or is clearly understood within the context of the conversation or text. It acts as a direct reference to something previously established, emphasizing its similarity to the current topic.\n\nWhile 「こうした」 is often encountered in formal or semi-formal settings, such as academic papers, news reports, or business discussions, it can also appear in casual conversations when the speaker wishes to refer precisely to a shared context. It is generally more formal than 「こういう」 or 「こんな」, and its usage often implies a degree of deliberation or specificity.",

            "nuance": "While `こうした` refers back to something already mentioned, `こういう` can introduce something new or exemplify a general category. `こうした` is generally more formal and refers to specific, previously established contexts, whereas `こういう` is more versatile and can be used in a broader range of contexts, including introducing new examples."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "`こんな` is a more casual equivalent to `こうした`, used to describe something similar in a less formal setting. `こんな` refers to things nearby or general types without necessarily implying a prior discussion, making it less specific than `こうした`."

            "meaning": "Such; like that",

            "nuance": "`そのような` refers to something already known or mentioned, similar to `こうした`, but it often has a slightly more detached tone. `そのような` implies a higher degree of formality or distance compared to `こうした`, which is more direct in its reference to the immediate context."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing between `こうした`, `こういう`, `こんな`, and `そのような`, consider the level of formality and the specificity of the reference. `こうした` is best used in more formal or semi-formal contexts to refer back to something specific that has just been discussed or presented. `こういう` can be used more generally and informally to introduce new types or examples. `こんな` is the most casual and typically refers to things perceived directly or without much prior context. `そのような` is formal and refers to something known but not necessarily immediately present or discussed, often implying a greater psychological distance.",

            "etymology": "The `～てしまいました` ending often implies regret or an action completed entirely, with a sense of finality. It can also simply express completion in a casual way. Its nuance here highlights the finality of selling the car, possibly with a hint of reluctance or wistfulness."

            "etymology": "`気が合う` (ki ga au) literally means 'spirits/feelings match' or 'minds meet.' `気` (ki) encompasses a broad range of meanings including spirit, energy, mood, and mind, while `合う` (au) means 'to fit' or 'to match.' This phrase effectively describes a compatibility of personalities or interests."

            "nuance": "The `～たいと思います` expresses a desire in a polite and formal way, suitable for an employee expressing their ambitions to a manager.",
            "etymology": "`活かす` (ikasu) means 'to make good use of' or 'to bring to life.' Its kanji `活` means 'lively' or 'active,' implying that one is taking something (like experience) and making it active or effective in a new context. This phrase indicates the intention to actively apply past learnings."

            "etymology": "`実を結ぶ` (mi o musubu) literally translates to 'to tie/bear fruit.' `実` (mi) refers to a fruit or, metaphorically, results. `結ぶ` (musubu) means 'to tie,' 'to connect,' or 'to form.' This idiom visually represents efforts leading to concrete, positive outcomes, much like a plant bearing fruit."

            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "serious",
            "etymology": "The verb `講じる` (kōjiru) literally means 'to lecture' or 'to expound upon,' but in this context, it takes on the meaning of 'to devise' or 'to take (measures),' stemming from its association with planning and implementing solutions, much like a detailed explanation of a policy. It is a more formal equivalent of `する` (suru) when discussing plans or actions related to policy or strategy. The character `講` (kō) means 'lecture' or 'public reading,' while `じる` is an inflectional ending, showing how the act of 'explaining' or 'expounding' came to mean 'to take action' in formal discourse, implying a well-thought-out approach. In Japanese, it is still used in this meaning of 'to devise measures' for example, `対策を講じる` (taisaku o kōjiru). The phrase `二度と` (nidoto) literally means 'a second time' or 'twice,' and when combined with a negative verb, it strongly emphasizes 'never again,' implying a firm resolve to prevent recurrence. This reinforces the serious and resolute tone of the statement."

            "nuance": "The sentence uses `～よ` at the end, which is a common sentence-final particle used by male speakers to assert or emphasize a point. The overall casual register and the direct tone of `もっと 率直 に 話し合う 必要 が ある と 思う` indicate an intimate conversation where the speaker is expressing a serious concern about their relationship. The phrase 「率直 に 話し合う」 implies a need for open and direct communication, highlighting the intimate and serious nature of the conversation.",
            "etymology": "`率直` (sotchoku) combines `率` (sotsu, ritsu) meaning 'rate, proportion, frankness' and `直` (choku, jiki) meaning 'straight, direct.' Together, it means 'frank' or 'direct,' emphasizing honesty and straightforwardness in communication. This word is often used in contexts where directness is called for, especially in serious discussions."
        }
    ],
    "post_example_writeup": "The examples illustrate how 「こうした」 functions as a demonstrative adjective, always modifying a noun, and always referring back to something specific that has been established in the immediate context. Whether it's a type of car, a design, a shared hobby, a professional experience, efforts, or an incident, 「こうした」 points to a concrete, previously mentioned example, rather than a general category. This specificity often lends a more formal or precise tone compared to its counterparts. Pay close attention to the context and what has been discussed just before 「こうした」 is used.",
