It is primarily used to refer to a specific type, kind, or example that has already been mentioned, demonstrated, or is clearly understood within the context of the conversation or text. It acts as a direct reference to something previously established, emphasizing its similarity to the current topic.\n\nWhile 「こうした」 is often encountered in formal or semi-formal settings, such as academic papers, news reports, or business discussions, it can also appear in casual conversations when the speaker wishes to refer precisely to a shared context. It is generally more formal than 「こういう」 or 「こんな」, and its usage often implies a degree of deliberation or specificity.",

It is a more formal equivalent of `する` (suru) when discussing plans or actions related to policy or strategy. The character `講` (kō) means 'lecture' or 'public reading,' while `じる` is an inflectional ending, showing how the act of 'explaining' or 'expounding' came to mean 'to take action' in formal discourse, implying a well-thought-out approach.

Whether it's a type of car, a design, a shared hobby, a professional experience, efforts, an incident, a complex problem, a research pattern, or beautiful scenery, 「こうした」 points to a concrete, previously mentioned example, rather than a general category. This specificity often lends a more formal or precise tone compared to its counterparts. Pay close attention to the context and what has been discussed just before 「こうした」 is used.",
