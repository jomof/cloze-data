        "nuance": "Implies that the speaker is referencing a specific instance or type that has already been presented or discussed.",
        "colocation": "Often precedes nouns like 問題 (mondai - problem), 行為 (kōi - act), 経験 (keiken - experience), 話 (hanashi - story), デザイン (dezain - design), 努力 (doryoku - effort), 関係 (kankei - relationship).",

    "etymology": "「こう」 (kou) means \"this way\" or \"like this\". 「した」 (shita) is the past tense form of the verb 「する」 (suru), which means \"to do\". Therefore, 「こうした」 literally means \"did like this\" or \"happened like this\", implying a preceding action or example that sets the context for the current reference.",
    "writeup": "「こうした」 is a demonstrative adjective that means \"like this\" or \"such\". It is primarily used to refer to a specific type, kind, or example that has already been mentioned, demonstrated, or is clearly understood within the context of the conversation or text. It acts as a direct reference to something previously established, emphasizing its similarity to the current topic.\n\nWhile 「こうした」 is often encountered in formal or semi-formal settings, such as academic papers, news reports, or business discussions, it can also appear in casual conversations when the speaker wishes to refer precisely to a shared context. It is generally more formal than 「こういう」 or 「こんな」, and its usage often implies a degree of deliberation or specificity.",

It is a more formal equivalent of `する` (suru) when discussing plans or actions related to policy or strategy. The character `講` (kō) means 'lecture' or 'public reading,' while `じる` is an inflectional ending, showing how the act of 'explaining' or 'expounding' came to mean 'to take action' in formal discourse, implying a well-thought-out approach.
