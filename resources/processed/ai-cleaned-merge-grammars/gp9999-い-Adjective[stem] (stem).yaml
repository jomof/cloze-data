grammar_point: い-Adjective[stem] (stem)
learn_before:
  - い-Adjective[がる] (showing signs of)
  - そう (like that)
  - ちょっと (adverb)
id: gp9999
meaning: The base form of い-adjectives, used for conjugation and to form compound words.
pronunciation:
  katakana: ケイヨウシ ゴカン
  romaji: keiyoushi gokan
  pronunciation_warning: This is the technical term for 'adjective stem'. The stem itself is pronounced
    as the base adjective without the final い, as in 『高い』 (takai) becoming 『高』 (taka).
formation:
  い-Adjective (minus い): The base form of an い-adjective, used for various conjugations and to form compound
    words (e.g., 高い → 高).
  い-Adjective[stem] + [Suffix]: Connects the stem to various suffixes and auxiliary verbs (e.g., 楽しい +
    そう → 楽しそう).
  い-Adjective[stem] + Noun: Forms compound nouns (e.g., 早い + 飯 → 早飯).
  い-Adjective[stem] + Verb: Forms compound verbs (e.g., 辛い + 当たる → 辛く当たる).

etymology: The concept of a 'stem' (語幹・ごかん) in Japanese grammar originates from classical linguistic analysis,
  where words were broken down into invariant parts (stems) and variant parts (endings or suffixes). For
  い-adjectives, the final い is the conjugational ending, while the preceding part is the stem, signifying
  the core meaning. This analytical approach helps understand the systematic nature of Japanese word formation.
writeup: The い-adjective stem is the base form of an い-adjective, created by removing the final い. For
  example, the stem of 楽しい (tanoshii, fun) is 楽し (tanoshi). This stem form is not a standalone word in
  modern Japanese but serves as a crucial building block for various conjugations and the formation of
  compound words. It's essential to understand the stem because it's the point of attachment for suffixes
  like く (adverbial form), さ (nominalizer), そう (appearance), がる (showing signs), and すぎる (excessive).
  While the stem itself doesn't carry independent meaning or register, its combination with other elements
  allows for a wide range of grammatical functions and expressive nuances.
false_friends:
  - term: い-Adjective[く] (adverbial form)
    meaning: used to connect to verbs or to form adverbial phrases
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both い-adjective stem and the く-form are derived from the い-adjective, the stem (e.g.,
      高) is the core base, whereas the く-form (e.g., 高く) is an adverbial conjugation used to modify verbs
      or other adjectives, or to connect clauses. The stem cannot stand alone as a modifier.

  - term: い-Adjective[さ] (nominalizer)
    meaning: forms a noun indicating the degree or extent of the adjective's quality
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The さ-form (e.g., 高さ - height) converts the adjective into a noun, indicating a measurable
      quality. The stem is merely the base for this transformation; さ is the actual nominalizing suffix
      that performs the nominalization.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[さ] (nominalizer)
  - term: い-Adjective[そう] (appearance)
    meaning: to seem or look like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The そう-form (e.g., 楽しそう - looks fun) directly attaches to the い-adjective stem to express
      appearance or likelihood. The stem provides the core meaning, and そう adds the nuance of conjecture
      or outward appearance.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[そう] (appearance)
post_false_friends_writeup: The い-adjective stem is the fundamental part of the adjective before any conjugations
  are applied. The forms that follow, such as the く-form, さ-form, and そう-form, are all created by attaching
  different suffixes directly to this stem. It's important to remember that the stem itself is usually
  not used independently in a sentence; it requires a suffix or another word to complete its grammatical
  function or form a new compound word. Each suffix adds a distinct grammatical role or nuance to the
  original adjective's meaning.

post_example_writeup: These examples illustrate how the い-adjective stem acts as a foundation. Whether
  forming compound words like 早飯 (hayameshi) or serving as the base for conjugations and suffixes such
  as in 楽しそう (tanoshisou) or 美しさ (utsukushisa), the stem is the invariable core that carries the adjective's
  fundamental meaning. Understanding this allows for a more intuitive grasp of how い-adjectives function
  and adapt within sentences.
