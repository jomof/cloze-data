formation:
  い-Adjective (dictionary form) - い: Remove the final い from an い-adjective in its dictionary form to
    obtain the stem. For example, 寒い (samui) becomes 寒 (samu).
jlpt: N5
etymology: The concept of a 'stem' (語幹, gokan) in Japanese grammar, particularly for い-adjectives, is
  derived from traditional linguistic analysis. It refers to the invariant part of a word that remains
  after inflectional endings are removed. This stem serves as the base onto which various suffixes are
  attached to form different grammatical functions, such as expressing appearance (～そう), excess (～すぎる),
  or showing signs of feeling (～がる). It's a fundamental element in understanding how adjectives modify
  and connect within sentences.
writeup: |-
  The stem form of an い-adjective is created by removing the final 「い」 from its dictionary form. For example, 寒い (samui, cold) becomes 寒 (samu), and 嬉しい (ureshii, happy) becomes 嬉し (ureshi). This stem form is not a complete word on its own and cannot be used independently in a sentence. Instead, it acts as a foundational base to which various grammatical suffixes or other words are attached, allowing the adjective to express a wide range of meanings and nuances.

  This form is crucial for creating more complex expressions, such as stating how something 'looks' (～そう), how a quality is 'too much' (～すぎる), or how someone 'shows signs of' a feeling (～がる). It is also used in certain compound word formations. Understanding the い-adjective stem is fundamental to mastering Japanese adjective conjugation and usage.

  - term: い-Adjective[く]
    meaning: adverbial form
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While the い-Adjective stem is the base, adding 「く」 forms the adverbial form, which modifies
      verbs or other adjectives. For instance, 速い (hayai, fast) becomes 速く (hayaku) to mean 'quickly'.
      We're looking for the simple stem, not its adverbial use.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[く] (adverbial form)
  - term: い-Adjective[さ]
    meaning: nominalizer
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Adding 「さ」 to the い-Adjective stem creates a noun that expresses the abstract quality or state.
      For example, 嬉しい (ureshii, happy) becomes 嬉しさ (ureshi-sa), meaning 'happiness'. This is a different
      function than merely being the stem for conjugation.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[さ] (nominalizer)
  - term: い-Adjective[くて]
    meaning: te-form
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The 「くて」 form is derived from the stem and is used to connect adjectives or clauses, or to
      state a reason. For example, 寒い (samui, cold) becomes 寒くて (samukute, and it's cold / because it's
      cold). The stem is just the base, while 「くて」 adds a connective function.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[くて] (te-form)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'The い-Adjective stem is the core component from which many other forms are
  built. The key distinction lies in the suffix that follows the stem: 「く」 creates an adverb, 「さ」 creates
  a noun, and 「くて」 connects clauses. All these forms utilize the basic stem, but each adds a unique grammatical
  function that the bare stem does not possess on its own.'

      behavior of showing loneliness. The 「んです」 adds an explanatory nuance.

      happy'. The sentence focuses on the observable appearance of happiness, rather than a direct statement

      was commonly inflected from a base form beginning with よ. This historical development contributes
      to its unique conjugation pattern in modern Japanese.

    nuance: 苦すぎる (niga-sugiru) uses the stem 苦 (niga) from 苦い (nigai, bitter) to express that the coffee
      was excessively bitter. This clearly indicates the bitterness was beyond an acceptable level, preventing
      consumption.
    etymology: The verb 飲む (nomu, to drink) has a potential form 飲める (nomeru, can drink), and its negative
      is 飲めない (nomenai, cannot drink). This ability form is frequently used to express what is possible
      or impossible to do.
