    "etymology": "The suffix 「がち」 originates from the Japanese word 「勝ち(かち)」, meaning \"win.\" This etymology suggests that out of multiple possibilities, one particular outcome or tendency is more likely to \"win out\" or prevail over others. This prevailing tendency can be due to various factors, including personal preference or simply recurring circumstances, often with a subtle connotation of something undesirable.",
    "writeup": "「がち」 is a Japanese suffix that attaches to the stem of verbs (the ます-stem) or to nouns. It signifies a tendency towards a particular action, state, or outcome. While 「がち」 can describe any frequent occurrence, it is most commonly employed to express tendencies that are often negative or undesirable. For instance, 「病気がち」 means \"prone to illness,\" highlighting an ongoing susceptibility rather than a single instance of being sick. This usage reflects the idea that a certain outcome \"wins out\" or occurs repeatedly, establishing a pattern or predisposition.",
