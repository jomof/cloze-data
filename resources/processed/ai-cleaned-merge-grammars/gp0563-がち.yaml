    "etymology": "The suffix 「がち」 comes from the word 「勝ち(かち)」, meaning \"win.\" The nuance is that out of several possibilities, one outcome is more likely to \"win out\" over the others, whether due to preference or luck.",
    "writeup": "「がち」 is a suffix in Japanese that attaches to the stem of verbs (the ます-stem) or to nouns. It indicates a tendency towards something, often something undesirable. Think of it as something that \"wins out\" more often than not. While not always negative, 「がち」 is most frequently used to express negative tendencies. For example, 「病気がち」 means \"prone to illness.\"",
