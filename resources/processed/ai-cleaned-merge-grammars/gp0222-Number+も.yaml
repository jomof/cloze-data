        "katakana": "ナンバーモ",
        "romaji": "nanbā mo"
    },
    "formation": {
        "Number + Counter + も": "Indicates a surprising or emphatic quantity."

    "meaning": "Indicates a surprising or emphatic quantity, e.g. “as many as” or “not even.",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Standard",
        "Usage": "General"
    },
    "etymology": "も (mo) is a particle that originally means \"also\" or \"too.\" When used with numbers, it emphasizes the quantity, expressing surprise or disbelief, similar to how \"even\" or \"as much as\" functions in English. It's like saying, \"Wow, *even* that many!\"",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle も (mo) is often used to highlight something unexpected within a category. When used after a specific number + counter, it emphasizes that the number itself is surprising, whether higher or lower than expected. This creates translations such as \"as much as (A)\" or \"not even (A)\". While seemingly different from も's \"too\" or \"also\", it still points out something unexpected joining a group.",
    "examples": [
        {
            "japanese": "12時間{も} 仕事を したから 疲れた。",

            "scene": "A person complaining after a long day at work.",
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "melancholic",
            "nuance": "「～から」 means \"because\", and connects working a long time to feeling tired. The 「も」 emphasizes how long the person worked. There's not much to say here."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "その携帯 20万円{も} したの？",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "surprised",
            "nuance": "「～の」 at the end makes this a question, and there's an intimation of disbelief in the speaker's voice that the cellphone cost so much. The 「も」 emphasizes how expensive the phone was."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "私 は 一回{も} 地下鉄 に 乗った ことが 無い。",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "「～たことが無い」 means \"I have never done something.\" Adding 「も」 after 「一回」 emphasizes the fact that this person has *never* taken the subway.",
            "etymology": "Note the use of 「無い」 instead of 「ない」, indicating a more formal or written style, though it's not particularly noticeable in casual speech."

            "setting": "pessimistic",
            "nuance": "「～なくてはいけない」 means \"have to do something.\" The 「も」 highlights the speaker's disbelief or frustration at having to pay such a large amount.",
            "etymology": "The phrase 「～なくては」 is a contraction of 「～なくてはならない」, and both are commonly used."

            "etymology": "Note that this person used 「けど」 instead of 「が」, as that is more commonly used in casual speech to express the 'but' meaning."

            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "melancholic",
            "nuance": "「かかりました」 is the polite past tense of 「かかる」 (to take time). Adding 「も」 emphasizes how long the journey felt. It's more intense than simply saying 「１５時間かかりました」."

            "setting": "reflective",
            "nuance": "Here, the speaker finds their lack of fatigue surprising, given the long drive. 「あまり～ない」 means \"not really\" or \"not much.\"",
            "etymology": "The speaker used the expression 「～ていない」, which means the same as 「～ない」, but implies that the event is still ongoing."

            "nuance": "The speaker is an older person, likely a parent, speaking to a younger person, likely their child. They are saying 「掃除をして」 (clean) 「～でしょう」 (right?). Adding 「も」 after 「何回」 stresses the numerous times they've repeated the request."
