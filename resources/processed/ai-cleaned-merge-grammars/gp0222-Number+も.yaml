        "Number + Counter + も": "To express a surprisingly large or small quantity.",
        "一つも / 一人も + (negative verb)": "To emphasize a complete lack of something (e.g., \"not even one\")."

    "etymology": "も (mo) is a particle that originally means \"also\" or \"too.\" When used with numbers, it emphasizes the quantity, expressing surprise or disbelief, similar to how \"even\" or \"as much as\" functions in English. It's like saying, \"Wow, *even* that many!\"",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle も (mo) is often used to highlight something unexpected within a category. When used after a specific number + counter, it emphasizes that the number itself is surprising, whether higher or lower than expected. This creates translations such as \"as much as (A)\" or \"not even (A)\". While seemingly different from も's \"too\" or \"also\", it still points out something unexpected joining a group.",

            "setting": "melancholic",
            "nuance": "「～から」 indicates \"because\", connecting the action of working to the resulting fatigue. The particle 「も」 here emphasizes the surprising or considerable duration of the work, indicating that 12 hours is perceived as a long time by the speaker."
