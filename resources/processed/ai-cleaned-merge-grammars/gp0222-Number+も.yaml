    "etymology": "も (mo) is a particle that originally means \"also\" or \"too.\" When used with numbers, it emphasizes the quantity, expressing surprise or disbelief, similar to how \"even\" or \"as much as\" functions in English. It's like saying, \"Wow, *even* that many!\"",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle も (mo) is used to highlight something unexpected within a given context. When placed after a specific number and counter, it emphasizes that the quantity itself is surprising, regardless of whether it's higher or lower than anticipated. This can be translated as \"as much as (A)\" or \"not even (A)\" in English. For instance, in the case of 一つも (not even one) or 一人も (not even one person), も powerfully stresses the complete absence. While this usage may seem distinct from も's general meaning of \"also\" or \"too,\" it fundamentally extends the same concept: pointing out something unexpected that falls within a particular category or group.",

            "meaning": "only; nothing but",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「Number+も」, 「ばかり」 indicates an exclusive focus on one thing, implying that there is nothing else. For example, 「彼はゲームばかりしている」 (He only plays games) means he does nothing but play games. 「Number+も」 emphasizes the surprising quantity of something, not its exclusivity."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「Quantity + も」 is used to emphasize an unexpected quantity, 「ばかり」 conveys an exclusive meaning, indicating that only a certain thing exists or that a certain state continues. It's crucial to differentiate: use 「も」 to highlight surprising amounts, and 「ばかり」 to express exclusivity or that something is solely present.",
