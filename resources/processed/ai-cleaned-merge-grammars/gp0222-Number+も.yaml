    "etymology": "も (mo) is a particle that originally means \"also\" or \"too.\" When used with numbers, it emphasizes the quantity, expressing surprise or disbelief, similar to how \"even\" or \"as much as\" functions in English. It's like saying, \"Wow, *even* that many!\"",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle も (mo) is used to highlight something unexpected within a given context. When placed after a specific number and counter, it emphasizes that the quantity itself is surprising, regardless of whether it's higher or lower than anticipated. This can be translated as \"as much as (A)\" or \"not even (A)\" in English. For instance, in the case of 一つも (not even one) or 一人も (not even one person), も powerfully stresses the complete absence. While this usage may seem distinct from も's general meaning of \"also\" or \"too,\" it fundamentally extends the same concept: pointing out something unexpected that falls within a particular category or group.",
