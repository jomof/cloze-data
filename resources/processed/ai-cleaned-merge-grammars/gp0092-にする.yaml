    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にする」 combines the particle 「に」, indicating direction or purpose, with the verb 「する」 (to do). Therefore, it literally means 'to do in/towards X,' where X is the noun preceding 「に」. This gives rise to its various meanings of deciding, choosing, or transforming something.",
    "writeup": "「にする」 is a versatile grammatical structure combining the particle 「に」 (indicating a target or purpose) with the verb 「する」 (to do). This combination results in meanings like \"to decide on,\" \"to choose,\" \"to make something into,\" or \"to view something as\". The nuance of 「にする」 implies the speaker has direct control over the outcome, conveying a strong sense of personal choice or active influence. For example, when used for decision-making, the noun preceding 「に」 is the item or choice being made. While often translated as 'to decide', it holds a nuance closer to a firm declaration, akin to the English slang 'I'll do (A)' as in 'I'll make it a beer.'\n\nThis grammar point can also indicate transformation, such as in 「部屋をきれいにする」 (\"to make the room clean\"), where something is actively changed into a new state.\n\nOccasionally, the particle 「と」 is used instead of 「に」, forming 「とする」. While sharing a similar meaning, 「とする」 subtly shifts the nuance, removing the strong feeling of a direct, personal decision. It tends to be used in more formal contexts, as its less definitive nature makes the phrase sound less assertive. To illustrate the difference, consider: 「にする」 is like saying \"I'll buy a burger\" (a direct target), whereas 「とする」 is closer to \"I'll go with a burger\" (a softer, less direct approach). 「にする」 is not limited to concrete items; it can also be used with more abstract nouns.",
