        "colocation": "Often collocates with nouns representing choices (e.g., drinks, food, items) or states (e.g., きれいにする - to make clean)."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にする」 combines the particle 「に」, which indicates direction, purpose, or result, with the verb 「する」 (to do, to make). Therefore, it literally means 'to do/make towards/into X,' where X is the noun preceding 「に」. This fundamental meaning gives rise to its various usages, such as deciding on something (making it your choice), choosing something (making it your selection), or transforming something (making it into a new state). The particle 「に」 here functions similarly to how it indicates a resulting state or direct object in other constructions, emphasizing the outcome of the action expressed by 「する」.",
    "writeup": "「にする」 is a versatile grammatical structure in Japanese that combines the particle 「に」 with the verb 「する」 (to do). This combination inherently carries the meaning of 'to do towards' or 'to make into.' It is primarily used to express a **volitional decision or choice** made by the speaker, or to indicate that the speaker is actively **transforming something** into a particular state.\n\nThe core nuance of 「にする」 lies in the speaker's **direct control and personal agency** over the outcome. When you use 「にする」, you are stating that *you* are making the decision or *you* are causing the transformation. This is particularly evident in contexts like ordering food or selecting an item, where the speaker is actively making a choice. For example, 「コーヒーにする」 (kōhii ni suru) means \"I'll go with coffee\" or \"I'll choose coffee,\" reflecting a personal decision.\n\nWhile often translated as 'to decide,' its nuance is closer to the English expression 'I'll do (A)' or 'I'll make it (A),' implying a firm declaration of choice. The noun preceding 「に」 is the item or choice being made.\n\nIt is important to differentiate 「にする」 from 「とする」. Although 「とする」 can also mean 'to decide on' or 'to make,' it carries a slightly different nuance. 「とする」 tends to soften the directness of the decision, making it sound less assertive or more like a general agreement rather than a personal, firm choice. It is often used in more formal or written contexts. Think of 「にする」 as saying, \"I will buy a burger\" (a direct target of your action), whereas 「とする」 is more akin to \"I will go with a burger\" (a softer, less direct approach that might imply a more collective or less personal decision). 「にする」 is not limited to concrete items; it can be used with abstract nouns as well.",
