    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にする」 combines the particle 「に」, indicating direction or purpose, with the verb 「する」 (to do). Therefore, it literally means 'to do in/towards X,' where X is the noun preceding 「に」. This gives rise to its various meanings of deciding, choosing, or transforming something.",
    "writeup": "「にする」 is a versatile grammatical structure combining the particle 「に」 (indicating a target or purpose) with the verb 「する」 (to do). This combination results in meanings like \"to decide on,\" \"to choose,\" \"to make something into,\" or \"to view something as\". The nuance of 「にする」 often implies direct control or influence over the outcome.\n\n*   When expressing a **decision or choice**, the noun preceding 「に」 is what's being chosen. For example, 「コーヒーにする」 means \"I'll have coffee\" or \"I choose coffee.\"\n\n*   It can also indicate **transformation or conversion**, like in 「部屋をきれいにする」, which means \"to make the room clean.\" Here, something is being actively changed into a different state.\n\n*   While 「とする」 shares similar meanings, it tends to be more formal and less assertive than 「にする」.",
