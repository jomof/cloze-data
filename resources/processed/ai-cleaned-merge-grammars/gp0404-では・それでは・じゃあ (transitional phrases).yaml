  romaji: de wa, sore de wa, jaa
formation:
  では / それでは / じゃあ: Used to transition topics, indicate a conclusion, or as a polite farewell.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to connect ideas, introduce a new topic, or signal the end of a conversation or
    activity. Ranges from casual (じゃあ) to formal (それでは).
  function: Discourse marker, connector, transitional phrase.
  nuance: These expressions serve as logical bridges in conversation or writing, indicating a shift in
    topic, a conclusion, or a consequence based on prior information. They also function as polite farewells.
  grammatical-role: Conjunction, sentence connector
  logical-flow: Signals a logical progression or conclusion from previous statements.
  temporal-flow: Can indicate a shift in timing or the beginning of a new phase (e.g., 'now that X has
    happened, let's do Y').
etymology: では is a contraction of で + は. で is the particle indicating location or means, and は is the
  topic marker. Therefore, the original nuance might have been something like 'in that case' or 'regarding
  that matter.' それでは further expands this by adding それ (that). じゃあ is a more casual contraction of では
  or それでは.
writeup: The expressions **では**, **それでは**, and **じゃあ** function as conjunctions in Japanese, signaling
  a transition in discourse, indicating a conclusion, or serving as a polite valediction. **それでは** represents
  the most formal iteration, followed by **では**, with **じゃあ** being the most casual. Fundamentally, they
  all convey similar notions such as 'if so,' 'well then,' or 'in that case.' Their utility extends beyond
  simple transitions; they often preface a logical consequence stemming from a preceding statement or
  mark a significant shift in conversational topic. Notably, these forms, particularly **では** and **それでは**,
  are also employed to politely conclude an an interaction, akin to the English 'well, I must be going
  now.' The underlying structure of **それでは** can be analyzed as a compound of それ (that), the particle
  で (indicating means or context), and the topic marker は, collectively creating a cohesive unit for initiating
  a new phase of communication or concluding a current one.
false_friends:
  - term: さ (interjection)
    meaning: All right, There we go, Now, You see, Well (I don't know, let me see)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both can be translated as "well," さ often indicates hesitation or a new idea coming
      to mind, whereas では/それでは/じゃあ indicates a transition or conclusion.
    grammar_point: さ (interjection)
  - term: さて
    meaning: Well, Well then
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both can be translated as "well," さて is often used to change the subject or indicate
      a new beginning, whereas では/それでは/じゃあ implies a connection to the previous topic.
    grammar_point: さて (transitional word)
  - term: なら
    meaning: If that's the case; in that case
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike では/それでは/じゃあ which function as general discourse markers or conclusions, 「なら」 introduces
      a conditional statement, meaning "if X (which is already known or stated), then Y." It implies a
      condition rather than a direct consequence.
    grammar_point: なら (conditional, if it's the case that A)
  - term: だとすれば (if that is the case)
    meaning: If that is the case, then...
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: A more formal and explicit conditional phrase than 「なら」, 「だとすれば」 strongly emphasizes the premise
      ("if that were true"). It sets up a logical inference from an assumption, rather than just marking
      a general transition.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:だとすれば (if that is the case)
  - term: それなら
    meaning: If that's the case; in that case
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Similar to 「なら」, 「それなら」 is used to introduce a statement or action that logically follows
      from something previously mentioned. It is a conditional, not a general transition marker like では/それでは/じゃあ,
      and links the new point directly to the preceding information.
    grammar_point: それなら (if that's the case)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key to distinguishing between では/それでは/じゃあ, さ, さて, and conditional forms
  like なら/だとすれば/それなら lies in understanding their specific nuances. では/それでは/じゃあ signal a transition, conclusion,
  or polite farewell. さ is more of a filler word, indicating hesitation or a thought process. さて indicates
  a change of subject or a new beginning. Conditionals like なら, だとすれば, and それなら, while sometimes translated
  similarly, explicitly set up a logical consequence based on a given or assumed premise, rather than
  simply marking a general discourse transition. Context is crucial in determining the correct choice.
examples:
  - english: It seems the rain has stopped. Well then, shall we go for a walk in the park?
    japanese:
      - 雨 が 止ん だ よう です ね。{で は}、公園 へ 散歩 に 行き ませ ん か。
      - 雨 が 止ん だ よう です ね。{じゃあ}、公園 へ 散歩 に 行き ませ ん か。
    english_literally: Rain stopped seemed like, isn't it? Well then, park to walk to go won't you?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 が 止ん だ よう です ね。公園 へ 散歩 に 行き ませ ん か。
        english: It seems the rain has stopped. Shall we go for a walk in the park?
        hint: This sentence lacks the smooth transition from the observation (rain stopping) to the suggestion.
          We're looking for a natural connector for the logical next step.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 が 止ん だ よう です ね。{さて}、公園 へ 散歩 に 行き ませ ん か。
        english: It seems the rain has stopped. Now, shall we go for a walk in the park?
        hint: While 「さて」 can introduce a new idea, it implies a more general change of subject. We're
          looking for a phrase that implies a direct consequence or logical next step based on the observed
          change.
    scene: Two friends are at home, looking out the window, and the rain has just stopped.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「では」 is used here to smoothly transition from an observation (the rain stopping) to a suggestion.
      The casual tone of the speaker and the inviting 「行きませんか」 (shall we go?) make it suitable for a friendly
      context. 「じゃあ」 would also fit this casual, friendly context, providing a slightly more informal
      feel while maintaining the smooth transition. This usage bridges the observation and the resulting
      proposal.
  - english: Have you finished packing? Well then, shall we get going soon?
    japanese:
      - 荷物 まとめ 終わっ た？{じゃあ}、そろそろ 出発 しよう か。
      - 荷物 まとめ 終わっ た？{で は}、そろそろ 出発 しよう か。
    english_literally: Baggage arranging finished? Well then, soon departure let's, huh?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 荷物 まとめ 終わっ た？そろそろ 出発 しよう か。
        english: Have you finished packing? Shall we get going soon?
        hint: This sentence misses the explicit, casual bridge that connects the confirmed readiness to
          the next action. We're looking for a smooth transition that casually signals a decision or next
          step.
    scene: Friends about to leave for a trip, confirming readiness.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「じゃあ」, being the most casual, fits perfectly here to confirm the readiness for departure between
      friends. The question 「荷物まとめ終わった？」 (Have you finished packing?) and the volitional 「出発しようか」 (shall
      we get going?) indicate a shared, immediate action, reinforcing the informal setting. 「では」 could
      also be used here, offering a slightly less casual, but still friendly, transition. 「じゃあ」 provides
      a natural, casual flow from the prior confirmation to the action.
  - english: Thank you for your input. Well then, let's move on to the next agenda item.
    japanese:
      - ご 意見 ありがとう ござい ます。{で は}、次 の 議題 に 移り ましょう。
      - ご 意見 ありがとう ござい ます。{それ で は}、次 の 議題 に 移り ましょう。
    english_literally: Your opinion thank you. Well then, next agenda item to move let's.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ご 意見 ありがとう ござい ます。次 の 議題 に 移り ましょう。
        english: Thank you for your input. Let's move on to the next agenda item.
        hint: This sentence lacks the polite and clear signal for transitioning between discussion points
          in a formal setting. We're looking for a phrase that smoothly concludes one topic and introduces
          the next.
    scene: A meeting chairperson concluding a discussion point and moving to the next.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「では」 is a standard, formal way to transition topics in a professional setting like a meeting.
      「ご意見ありがとうございます」 (thank you for your input) politely concludes the previous discussion, and 「次の議題に移りましょう」
      (let's move on to the next agenda item) clearly directs the flow of the meeting. 「それでは」 would also
      be appropriate here, signaling an even more definitive and formal shift in topic. This use of 「では」
      signals a decisive, professional shift.
  - english: It's getting late, so I guess I'll head home now.
    japanese:
      - 時間 も 遅い し、{じゃあ}、そろそろ 帰る ね。
      - 時間 も 遅い し、{で は}、そろそろ 帰る ね。
    english_literally: Time also late, so, well then, soon return, okay?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 時間 も 遅い し、そろそろ 帰る ね。
        english: It's getting late, so I guess I'll head home now.
        hint: This sentence doesn't explicitly link the reason (getting late) to the action (leaving)
          with a transitional phrase. We're looking for a casual marker that connects the cause to the
          outcome.
    scene: A young person at a friend's house late at night, deciding to leave.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「じゃあ」 combined with 「そろそろ帰るね」 (I guess I'll head home soon, right?) is a very common and natural
      way for a younger person to politely excuse themselves from a casual gathering. The 「ね」 softens
      the statement, seeking a mild confirmation or understanding. 「では」 could also be used here, providing
      a slightly more formal, but still generally acceptable, transition for a casual departure. This
      usage of 「じゃあ」 provides a gentle, logical transition to the act of leaving.
  - english: Thank you very much for today. Well then, I will excuse myself now.
    japanese:
      - 本日 は ありがとう ござい まし た。{で は}、これ で 失礼 いたし ます。
      - 本日 は ありがとう ござい まし た。{それ で は}、これ で 失礼 いたし ます。
    english_literally: Today thank you very much. Well then, this with excuse myself.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 本日 は ありがとう ござい まし た。これ で 失礼 いたし ます。
        english: Thank you very much for today. I will excuse myself now.
        hint: This sentence lacks the polite and definitive signal for ending an interaction and departing.
          We're looking for a formal bridge that transitions to an act of leaving.
    scene: A business person concluding a meeting with clients and departing.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「では」 is used in highly formal business contexts to mark the end of an interaction and the
      beginning of departure. 「失礼いたします」 is the humble form of 「失礼します」, elevating the politeness level,
      appropriate when addressing clients or superiors. 「それでは」 can also be used in this context, providing
      an even more formal and definitive conclusion to the interaction. 「では」 ensures a professional and
      smooth conclusion to the encounter.
  - english: That concludes the first half of the explanation. Well then, let's proceed to the second
      half.
    japanese:
      - 以上 で 前半 の 説明 を 終わり ます。{で は}、後半 へ 進み ましょう。
      - 以上 で 前半 の 説明 を 終わり ます。{それ で は}、後半 へ 進み ましょう。
    english_literally: Above with first half's explanation end. Well then, latter half to proceed let's.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 以上 で 前半 の 説明 を 終わり ます。後半 へ 進み ましょう。
        english: That concludes the first half of the explanation. Let's proceed to the second half.
        hint: This sentence misses the clear and concise transition used in instructional or presentational
          settings. We're looking for a formal marker that signals the conclusion of one segment and the
          progression to the next.
    scene: A lecturer finishing one section of a presentation and moving to the next.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「では」 here is a clear and concise transition used in instructional or presentational settings.
      It signifies the conclusion of one segment 「前半の説明を終わります」 (the first half of the explanation ends)
      and the immediate progression to the next 「後半へ進みましょう」 (let's proceed to the second half). 「それでは」
      would also fit this academic setting, offering a slightly more formal feel for the transition. This
      creates a structured flow for the audience.
  - english: Thank you for the report. In that case, may I interpret this matter as approved?
    japanese:
      - ご 報告 ありがとう ござい ます。{それ で は}、この 件 は 承認 さ れ た と 解釈 し て よろしい でしょう か。
      - ご 報告 ありがとう ござい ます。{で は}、この 件 は 承認 さ れ た と 解釈 し て よろしい でしょう か。
    english_literally: Your report thank you very much. In that case, this matter approved was as interpret
      may I?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ご 報告 ありがとう ござい ます。この 件 は 承認 さ れ た と 解釈 し て よろしい でしょう か。
        english: Thank you for the report. May I interpret this matter as approved?
        hint: This sentence lacks the formal phrase that explicitly draws a conclusion or seeks clarification
          based on the preceding information. We're looking for a word that clearly indicates a logical
          inference from what was just said.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ご 報告 ありがとう ござい ます。この 件 が 承認 さ れ た {なら} 解釈 し て よろしい でしょう か。
        english: Thank you for the report. If this matter is approved, may I interpret it as such?
        hint: 「なら」 introduces a conditional statement, implying 'if X is true.' Here, the manager is drawing
          a conclusion based on an existing report, not setting up a hypothetical condition. We're looking
          for a phrase that implies 'given that report, this is the conclusion'.
    scene: A manager confirming a decision based on a subordinate's report.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「それでは」 is used formally to draw a conclusion or seek clarification based on previously provided
      information. 「では」 could also be used here, providing a slightly less formal but still polite transition.
      「承認されたと解釈してよろしいでしょうか」 (may I interpret it as approved?) is a highly polite and indirect way of asking
      for confirmation in a professional setting. This choice reflects the careful consideration of the
      manager's inquiry.
  - english: From what you've told me, then, that mistake was your responsibility, wasn't it?
    japanese:
      - あなた の 話 を 聞く 限り、{それ で は}、あの ミス は 君 の 責任 と いう 事 です ね？
      - あなた の 話 を 聞く 限り、{で は}、あの ミス は 君 の 責任 と いう 事 です ね？
    english_literally: Your story to hear limit, well then, that mistake your responsibility is that thing,
      right?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あなた の 話 を 聞く 限り、あの ミス は 君 の 責任 と いう 事 です ね？
        english: As far as I've heard your story, that mistake is your responsibility, right?
        hint: This sentence doesn't explicitly link the conclusion about responsibility to the preceding
          information. We're looking for a word that connects the premise to the resulting statement clearly.
    scene: A project manager clarifying accountability with a team member.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: While 「それでは」 is formal, the slightly accusatory tone of 「君の責任という事ですね？」 (it's your responsibility,
      isn't it?) makes it semi-formal. 「では」 could also be used here, providing a slightly less formal
      but still serious transition. It's used to confirm an understanding or conclusion that might be
      sensitive, based on the preceding conversation 「あなたの話を聞く限り」 (as far as listening to your story).
      「それでは」 here emphasizes the logical flow leading to the potentially uncomfortable conclusion.
  - english: Today's meeting concludes with this. Well then, see you next week, at the same time.
    japanese:
      - 本日 の 打ち合わせ は これ で 終了 です。{で は}、また 来週、同じ 時間 に。
      - 本日 の 打ち合わせ は これ で 終了 です。{それ で は}、また 来週、同じ 時間 に。
    english_literally: Today's meeting this with end is. Well then, again next week, same time at.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 本日 の 打ち合わせ は これ で 終了 です。また 来週、同じ 時間 に。
        english: Today's meeting concludes with this. See you next week, at the same time.
        hint: This sentence lacks the polite and definitive signal for concluding the meeting and transitioning
          to the next interaction. We're looking for a phrase that formally wraps up the current session.
    scene: A team concluding a regular weekly meeting.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「では」 is a common closing phrase in formal or semi-formal settings, especially when scheduling
      the next interaction. 「本日の打ち合わせはこれて終了です」 (today's meeting ends with this) clearly signals the wrap-up,
      and 「また来週、同じ時間に」 (again next week, at the same time) is a concise way to confirm the next appointment.
      「それでは」 would also be a very natural choice here, providing a slightly more formal and definitive
      ending. The use of 「では」 provides a smooth and polite ending to the meeting.
  - english: Given the current situation, in that case, we need to create a new plan.
    japanese:
      - 現状 を 踏まえる と、{それ で は}、新た な 計画 を 立てる 必要 が あり ます。
      - 現状 を 踏まえる と、{で は}、新た な 計画 を 立てる 必要 が あり ます。
    english_literally: Current situation to step on, in that case, new plan to establish need exists.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 現状 を 踏まえる と、新た な 計画 を 立てる 必要 が あり ます。
        english: Considering the current situation, we need to create a new plan.
        hint: This sentence does not explicitly link the necessity of a new plan to the assessment of
          the current situation. We're looking for a word that formalizes this logical progression from
          circumstances to action.
    scene: Business leaders discussing a strategic pivot based on new information.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「それでは」 is used here to logically follow a statement of circumstances 「現状を踏まえると」 (given the
      current situation), leading to a necessary action or conclusion. It implies "given these facts,
      this is what follows." 「では」 could also be used here, providing a slightly less formal but still
      appropriate transition. The formal tone is suitable for strategic discussions. This use of 「それでは」
      emphasizes the cause-and-effect relationship in a formal setting.
  - english: Thank you for contacting us. Well then, after confirming the details, we will contact you
      again.
    japanese:
      - ご 連絡 ありがとう ござい ます。{で は}、詳細 を 確認 の 上、改めて ご 連絡 いたし ます。
      - ご 連絡 ありがとう ござい ます。{それ で は}、詳細 を 確認 の 上、改めて ご 連絡 いたし ます。
    english_literally: Your contact thank you. Well then, details confirm after, again contactいたします.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ご 連絡 ありがとう ござい ます。詳細 を 確認 の 上、改めて ご 連絡 いたし ます。
        english: Thank you for contacting us. After confirming the details, we will contact you again.
        hint: This sentence lacks the polite, professional bridge from acknowledging contact to stating
          the next steps. We're looking for a phrase that smooths the transition and outlines the subsequent
          action.
    scene: A customer service representative responding to a client inquiry.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「では」 is a common polite connector in customer service or business communication. It smoothly
      transitions from acknowledging receipt of contact 「ご連絡ありがとうございます」 to outlining the next steps 「詳細を確認の上、改めてご連絡いたします」
      (after confirming details, we will contact you again). 「それでは」 would also be very natural in this
      professional context, possibly adding a slightly more formal tone. The use of humble language 「いたします」
      reinforces the professional and polite register. 「では」 ensures the communication remains clear and
      courteous.
  - english: I see. Well then, would you like to go drink some delicious sake with me next time?
    japanese:
      - そう です ね、{じゃあ}、今度 一緒 に 美味しい お 酒 を 飲み に 行き ませ ん か？
      - そう です ね、{で は}、今度 一緒 に 美味しい お 酒 を 飲み に 行き ませ ん か？
    english_literally: That is, isn't it? Well then, next time together delicious sake to drink go won't
      you?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - そう です ね、今度 一緒 に 美味しい お 酒 を 飲み に 行き ませ ん か？
        english: I see. Would you like to go drink some delicious sake with me next time?
        hint: This sentence doesn't provide the smooth, casual transition from agreement to a personal
          invitation. We're looking for a word that subtly shifts the topic to a new suggestion.
    scene: A person at a bar trying to ask out someone they find attractive.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: flirty
    nuance: The slight hesitation and agreement with 「そうですね」 followed by a casual 「じゃあ」 sets up a smooth
      transition to an invitation. 「では」 could also be used here, maintaining a slightly more polite or
      reserved tone while still making the invitation. The phrase 「飲みに行きませんか」 (would you like to go drink...?)
      is a common, polite, and slightly suggestive way to invite someone for drinks. The speaker's use
      of 「美味しいお酒」 implies a shared enjoyment, hinting at a desire for a pleasant shared experience. The
      semi-formal politeness combined with the inviting tone is characteristic of flirting. 「じゃあ」 here
      serves to bridge the existing conversation with a new, more personal proposition.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「では・それでは・じゃあ」 are highly versatile transitional phrases.
  The choice between them depends primarily on the level of formality and the specific nuance you wish
  to convey. 「じゃあ」 is your go-to for casual, everyday interactions, while 「では」 offers a more general polite
  transition, and 「それでは」 steps up to formal and more definitive conclusions or shifts in professional
  or academic contexts. Mastering their usage allows for natural and appropriate communication in a wide
  range of situations.
