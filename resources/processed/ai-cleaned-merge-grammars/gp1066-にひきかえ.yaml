    "etymology": "The grammar point に引き換え is composed of に (a case-marking particle), 引き (the continuative form of 引く 'to pull'), and 換え (the continuative form of 換える 'to exchange, replace'). The literal sense is akin to 'pulling back and switching away from', emphasizing a strong contrast.",
    "writeup": "に引き換え is used to make stark comparisons between two things, often translated as \"in comparison to (A), (B)\" or \"in stark contrast to (A), (B).\" It highlights a significant difference or opposition between two observable or measurable facts, where one is usually considered good and the other bad, based on the speaker's subjective opinion.\n\n*   **Structure:** It can follow nouns or demonstrative pronouns directly. When used with い-adjectives or verbs, の is required before に引き換え. For な-adjectives, なの is required.\n*   **Emphasis on Contrast:** This pattern emphasizes a substantial difference, indicating that (A) and (B) are at opposite ends of a spectrum.\n*   **Observable Facts:** It is crucial that both (A) and (B) are based on observable or measurable facts rather than assumptions or guesses.\n*   **Sentence Initial Use:** それにひきかえ can be used to begin sentences, drawing a comparison to a previous statement.",
