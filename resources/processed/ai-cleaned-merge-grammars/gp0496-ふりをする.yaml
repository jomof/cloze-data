    "etymology": "The expression 「ふりをする」 (furi o suru) originates from the noun 「振り」 (furi), which fundamentally refers to a 'shake' or 'swing' (as in swinging a sword). Over time, it evolved to mean 'manner,' 'behavior,' or 'appearance.' The particle 「を」 (o) marks it as the direct object of the verb 「する」 (suru), meaning 'to do.' Therefore, 「ふりをする」 literally translates to 'to do an appearance,' conveying the sense of putting on a display or feigning a state. The core meaning of showing a certain behavior pattern on the outside, which may differ from the internal state, is central to its usage.",
    "writeup": "「ふりをする」 is a versatile Japanese expression used to describe someone 'pretending to be,' 'acting as if,' or 'putting on airs.' It's formed by combining the noun 「振り」 (furi), the adverbial particle 「を」 (o), and the verb 「する」 (suru).\n\nFundamentally, 「振り」 (furi) refers to an outward appearance or behavior. Therefore, 「ふりをする」 can be understood as 'making an appearance of' or 'giving off the impression of.' It doesn't necessarily imply malicious intent, but rather a conscious effort to display something that might not be entirely true to one's internal state or reality.\n\nSince 「振り」 is a noun, this expression is highly adaptable. It can combine with:\n*   **Nouns:** A noun followed by 「の」 (no) and then 「ふりをする」 (e.g., 「子供 の ふり を する」 - to pretend to be a child).\n*   **Verbs:** A plain form verb directly followed by 「ふりをする」 (e.g., 「寝る ふり を する」 - to pretend to sleep).\n*   **い-adjectives:** An い-adjective in its plain form followed by 「ふりをする」 (e.g., 「嬉しい ふり を する」 - to pretend to be happy).\n*   **な-adjectives:** A な-adjective followed by 「な」 (na) and then 「ふりをする」 (e.g., 「元気 な ふり を する」 - to pretend to be energetic).\n\nThis grammar point is commonly used in everyday conversation across various registers, from casual to polite, to describe situations where someone is feigning an action, emotion, or state.",
