    "etymology": "The expression 「ふりをする」 comes from the noun 「振り」 (furi), meaning \"shake\" or \"appearance\", the particle 「を」 (o), and the verb 「する」 (suru), \"to do\". The expression can be thought of as meaning \"to make the appearance of\".",
    "writeup": "「ふりをする」 is a Japanese expression indicating that someone is pretending to be something, putting on airs, or acting as if something is the case. It combines the noun 「振り」 (furi, \"a shake\" or \"appearance\"), the particle 「を」 (o), and the verb 「する」 (suru, \"to do\"). Think of it as \"giving off the impression of\" or \"making the appearance of.\"\n\nSince 「振り」 is a noun, you can use the attributive form of any word to modify it. For example, you can say 「元気なふりをする」 (genki na furi o suru) to mean \"to pretend to be cheerful.\" Note the な required for na-adjectives.\n\nIt's important to understand that 「振り」 doesn't inherently mean \"to pretend.\" It simply suggests that the outward behavior might differ from the internal state, whether mental or physical. Therefore, the expression implies a discrepancy between appearance and reality.",
