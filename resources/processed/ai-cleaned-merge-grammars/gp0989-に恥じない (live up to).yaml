pronunciation:
  katakana: ニハジナイ
  romaji: ni hajinai
formation:
  Noun + に + 恥じない: To not disgrace, to live up to
jlpt: N1
etymology: This grammar point is derived from 「恥じる」 (hajiru), an ichidan verb meaning "to feel ashamed"
  or "to be ashamed." The addition of 「ない」 (nai) negates this, creating the core meaning of "not being
  ashamed" or "not disgracing." The particle 「に」 indicates the object or standard that is not being shamed,
  resulting in the idiomatic expression "to live up to" or "to be worthy of."
writeup: The phrase **に恥じない** (ni hajinai) is a formal expression used to convey that someone or something
  lives up to a particular standard, reputation, or expectation. It signifies that the subject does not
  disgrace, dishonor, or fall short of what is expected, but rather maintains or even elevates the reputation
  associated with a given noun. Structurally, **に恥じない** follows a noun that represents the standard or
  reputation in question. The particle **に** marks this noun as the object toward which the action of
  'not shaming' is directed. Because of its core meaning of *not disgracing*, **に恥じない** is almost exclusively
  used in positive contexts, where the subject is being praised or affirmed for their commendable actions
  or qualities. While primarily a formal expression, its usage can vary depending on the context. In a
  professional or public setting, it communicates a strong sense of responsibility and dedication to maintaining
  high standards. In more personal contexts, it might express pride in one's actions or a desire to honor
  a legacy.

  - term: ～にふさわしい
    meaning: suitable for, appropriate for, worthy of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「に恥じない」 which implies upholding a reputation or not disgracing something, 「～にふさわしい」
      simply means "suitable" or "appropriate" without the nuance of actively avoiding shame or dishonor.
      It focuses on compatibility or fittingness rather than the maintenance of an existing standard or
      honor to avoid disgrace. 「にふさわしい」 can be used in negative contexts (e.g., ふさわしくない - 'unsuitable'),
      whereas 「に恥じない」 inherently carries a positive connotation related to maintaining a reputation, making
      its negative use rare or semantically different if forced (e.g., 恥じる – 'to be ashamed').
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:～にふさわしい (suitable for)
  - term: ～に足る
    meaning: worthy of, sufficient for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～に足る」 is a more formal and literary expression that signifies "being worthy of" or "sufficient
      for" something, often used for abstract concepts like "trust" or "respect." While it implies worthiness,
      it generally lacks the strong connotation of "not disgracing" that 「に恥じない」 carries. 「に足る」 emphasizes
      intrinsic merit or adequacy, while 「に恥じない」 emphasizes adherence to an external standard to avoid
      causing shame or discredit to it.
    grammar_point: に足る (worthy of)
  - term: を旨とする
    meaning: to make it one's principle, to hold as an ideal
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「に恥じない」 focuses on avoiding disgrace and upholding an external standard or reputation,
      「を旨とする」 indicates adopting an internal principle or ideal as a guiding rule for one's actions. It
      implies a proactive commitment to a personal or group philosophy rather than a reactive avoidance
      of shame.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:を旨とする (to make it one's principle)
  - term: にかなう
    meaning: to be in accord with, to meet, to suit
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に恥じない」 emphasizes actively upholding a reputation or standard to prevent disgrace. In contrast,
      「にかなう」 means to conform or be appropriate to a standard, expectation, or condition, without necessarily
      carrying the strong connotation of honor or shame avoidance. It suggests simply 'fitting' or 'matching'
      a requirement.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:にかなう (to be in accord with)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「に恥じない」, 「にふさわしい」, 「に足る」, 「を旨とする」, and 「にかなう」 can sometimes be translated
  similarly, their nuances differ significantly. 「に恥じない」 specifically conveys that something measures
  up to a standard or reputation by *not disgracing* it, implying an active effort to maintain honor.
  In contrast, 「にふさわしい」 indicates that something is simply *suitable* or *appropriate* for a given situation
  or role, without the strong implication of avoiding shame. 「に足る」 is a more formal expression used to
  state that something *possesses enough merit* to be considered worthy, often for abstract concepts like
  'trust' or 'respect', focusing on intrinsic value rather than external reputation management. 「を旨とする」
  refers to adopting an *internal* principle or ideal as a guiding philosophy for one's actions, emphasizing
  proactive commitment rather than reactive avoidance of shame. Lastly, 「にかなう」 means to *match* or *be
  in accord with* a standard, expectation, or condition, implying mere conformity without the strong emotional
  or moral weight of 'not disgracing'.

      a common speech pattern for athletes in such contexts.
