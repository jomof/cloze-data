id: gp9999
meaning: The adversative passive expresses that the subject experiences a negative effect or inconvenience
  due to someone else's action or an external event.
pronunciation:
  katakana: ラレル
  romaji: rareru
formation:
  'Godan verbs: Verb[uncontracted ない-form stem] + れる': For Godan verbs (e.g., 読む 'yomu'), remove the final
    character, add the 'a' sound to the preceding consonant, and then attach れる. For example, 読む becomes
    読まれる.
  'Ichidan verbs: Verb[ない-form stem] + られる': For Ichidan verbs (e.g., 食べる 'taberu'), keep the stem and
    attach られる. For example, 食べる becomes 食べられる.
  'Irregular verbs: する → される, 来る → 来られる': The irregular verbs する (to do) and 来る (to come) have special
    passive forms.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The passive form 「〜れる/〜られる」 evolved from classical Japanese to express not only simple passive
  voice but also potentiality, spontaneity, and the adversative sense. The adversative meaning specifically
  highlights the 'suffering' or 'receiving a negative impact' aspect, emphasizing that the subject is
  involuntarily subjected to an action that causes them inconvenience or harm.
writeup: |-
  The adversative passive in Japanese is a unique grammatical construction used to express that the subject of the sentence has been negatively affected by an action or event, often one that was outside of their control or unwelcome. Unlike the direct passive, which simply states that an action was performed on the subject (e.g., 「本が読まれた」 - The book was read), the adversative passive explicitly conveys the inconvenience, trouble, or suffering experienced by the subject.

  This form is often used when the speaker wants to complain about something, recount an unfortunate incident, or describe a situation where they were put in a difficult position by someone else's actions or by circumstances. The agent who performed the action is typically marked with the particle 「に」.

  For example, if your younger sibling ate your cake, you might say 「弟にケーキを{食べられた}」. While the direct passive would be 「ケーキが食べられた」 (The cake was eaten), using the adversative passive focuses on *your* inconvenience and how *you* were affected by your brother's action.

  - term: Verb[(ら)れる] (direct passive)
    meaning: Expresses an action being performed on the subject.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike the adversative passive, the direct passive simply states that an action happened to
      the subject without necessarily implying a negative impact. For example, 「彼に褒められた」 (He praised me)
      is a direct passive construction that usually carries a positive or neutral connotation.
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (direct passive)
  - term: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
    meaning: Expresses ability or possibility to do something.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This form has the exact same conjugation as the Ichidan adversative passive, but its meaning
      is completely different, indicating 'can do' rather than 'suffered from doing'. Context is crucial
      for distinguishing between these two. For instance, 「この本は読めない」 (This book cannot be read) uses the
      potential form, while 「友達に本を読まれた」 (My friend read my book, causing me trouble) uses the adversative
      passive.
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
post_false_friends_writeup: It's important to differentiate the adversative passive from the direct passive
  and the potential form, especially since Ichidan verbs share the same conjugation for adversative passive
  and potential. The key is to pay attention to the context and the nuance of whether the action is causing
  an unwanted effect on the subject or simply stating a fact about an action, or an ability.
