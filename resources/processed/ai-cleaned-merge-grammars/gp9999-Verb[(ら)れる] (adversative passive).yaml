formation:
  'Godan Verbs: [Verb stem ending in う→あ] + れる': 'Example: 読む (yomu) → 読まれる (yomareru - to be read, adversely)'
  'Ichidan Verbs: [Verb stem] + られる': 'Example: 食べる (taberu) → 食べられる (taberareru - to be eaten, adversely)'
  'Irregular Verbs: する → される': 'Example: する (suru) → される (sareru - to be done, adversely)'
  'Irregular Verbs: 来る (kuru) → 来られる (korareru)': 'Example: 来る (kuru) → 来られる (korareru - to be come to
    or visited by, adversely)'
  '[Subject] は/が [Agent] に [Verb (passive form)]': The subject (the one who experiences the action) is
    marked with は or が. The agent (the one performing the action) is marked with に. This structure often
    implies that the action by the agent negatively affects the subject.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used when the subject of the sentence experiences an action done by another party, and
    this action is perceived as negative, troublesome, or unwelcome by the subject. This is often called
    the 'suffering passive' or 'adversative passive'.
  function: To express that the subject is adversely affected by an action performed by an agent. It highlights
    the subject's involuntary or unfortunate reception of the action.
  nuance: The core nuance is one of inconvenience, annoyance, suffering, or being put in an undesirable
    situation due to someone else's action. It's not merely a neutral statement of fact (which is the
    function of the regular passive). It implies a negative emotional or physical impact on the subject.
  counterpoint: Contrasts sharply with the neutral passive, which simply states that an action happened
    to someone or something without implying adversity. For example, 「パンが食べられた」(The bread was eaten) could
    be neutral, but if a child says 「犬にパンを{食べられた}！」(The dog ate my bread! - implying regret), it's a suffering
    passive.
  grammatical-role: The grammar highlights the passive subject as the 'victim' or affected party. The
    agent of the action (if stated) is always marked with the particle に.
  logical-flow: Reverses the direction of the action from agent-to-object to object-receiving-action,
    with an added implication of negative impact on the recipient.
  temporal-flow: Does not inherently change the temporal flow; it describes an action completed or experienced
    by the subject at a given time.
etymology: The Japanese passive voice, including the 'suffering passive,' originates from the auxiliary
  verb 「る/らる」 which historically attached to verb stems to indicate spontaneous action, possibility, or
  passive reception. Over time, the meaning evolved, and the form 「れる/られる」 became specifically associated
  with the passive. The 'suffering' or 'adversative' nuance developed from contexts where the passive
  reception of an action naturally led to an undesirable outcome for the subject, thus solidifying this
  specific emotional connotation.
writeup: The Japanese passive voice, formed with 「れる」 for Godan verbs and 「られる」 for Ichidan verbs and
  irregular verbs, has several functions. One of its most distinctive and frequently used functions is
  the **suffering passive**, also known as the **adversative passive**. This form is used when the subject
  of the sentence is negatively affected by an action performed by another party. While the basic passive
  form simply states that an action was performed on someone or something (e.g., 「ケーキが作られた」 - The cake
  was made), the suffering passive explicitly conveys that the subject experienced some kind of trouble,
  inconvenience, or emotional distress as a result of the action. The nuance is always negative from the
  subject's perspective, even if the action itself might seem neutral. For example, if you say 「雨に降られた」
  (I was rained on), it doesn't just mean that rain fell. It implies that the rain caused you inconvenience,
  perhaps you got wet, or your plans were ruined. Similarly, 「子供に遊んで壊された」 (I had my toys broken by my
  child) implies frustration or sadness. The suffering is personal to the subject. It is common to omit
  the agent (the one performing the action) if it is obvious from context or if the speaker wants to emphasize
  the unwelcome event rather than the perpetrator. However, when the agent is specified, it is always
  marked with the particle 「に」.

  - term: Verb[(ら)れる] (passive voice)
    meaning: to be Verbed (neutral, factual passive)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This form expresses a neutral or factual passive action, simply stating that something was
      done. It does not carry the connotation of the subject experiencing an unwanted or troublesome event,
      unlike the adversative passive. For example, 「本が読まれた」 (The book was read) states a fact without
      emotional implication, whereas the adversative passive would imply the reading was unwelcome.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[(ら)れる] (passive voice)
  - term: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
    meaning: can do, able to do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: The potential form expresses ability or possibility to perform an action. While sharing the
      exact same conjugation for Ichidan verbs (e.g., 「食べられる」) and some Godan verbs (e.g., 「読める」 from
      読める), its meaning is entirely different, lacking the passive or adversative implication. For example,
      「日本語が話せます」 (I can speak Japanese) indicates ability, not a negative experience.
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
  - term: Verb[させられる] (causative-passive)
    meaning: to be made to do, to be forced to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This form indicates that the subject is forced or compelled by someone else to perform an
      action, which often implies suffering or coercion. While similar in conveying an unwelcome imposition,
      the adversative passive specifically refers to actions *done to* the subject that negatively affect
      them, rather than actions the subject is forced to do themselves. For example, 「宿題をさせられた」 (I was
      made to do homework) implies compulsion, whereas 「財布を盗まれた」 (My wallet was stolen) is a direct, unwelcome
      action done *to* you.
    grammar_point: Verb[させられる] (causative-passive)
  - term: お[Verb-stem]になる・なさる・いらっしゃる (respectful action - sonkeigo)
    meaning: respectful form of verbs
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: The passive forms can also be used as honorifics (尊敬語) to elevate the status of the person
      performing the action (e.g., 「先生が話される」 - Sensei speaks). In this usage, there is no implied external
      agent; the honorific simply expresses respect for the subject. Context is crucial for distinguishing
      between passive and honorific usage.
    grammar_point: お[Verb-stem]になる・なさる・いらっしゃる (respectful action - sonkeigo)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing the adversative passive from the neutral passive, pay
  close attention to the context and the implied emotion. If the speaker is expressing annoyance, regret,
  or a negative impact, it's likely the adversative passive. The potential form is usually clear from
  context as it concerns ability. The causative passive, while also implying a negative experience, specifically
  indicates being *forced to do* something, which is a key distinction from having something *done to
  you*.

    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of 「割られちゃいました」 combines the passive voice 「割られる」 with the 「～ちゃう」 contraction of 「～てしまう」,
      adding a nuance of completion, regret, or an accidental occurrence. The particle 「に」 marks the agent
      「弟」, and the entire phrase implies the speaker's personal misfortune or slight annoyance at their
      younger brother's action.

        english: I made someone steal my wallet.
        hint: This uses the causative form, meaning the speaker caused someone to steal. We're looking

    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The use of 「盗まれた」 (nusumareta) directly conveys the speaker's personal suffering and loss,
      which is characteristic of the adversative passive. The particle 「に」 (ni) marks the agent (誰か -
      someone) who caused the adverse event.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 犬 が 死ん だ。
        english: The dog died.

      sadness.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: While the literal translation sounds odd in English, 「犬に{死なれた}」 (inu ni shinareta) perfectly
      captures the speaker's grief and personal suffering due to their dog's death. The animal (犬) is
      treated as the agent that causes the suffering by dying, marking a profound personal loss. This
      is a common and empathetic use of the adversative passive in Japanese, showing the speaker's connection
      and sorrow.

          - せっかく 髪 を セット し た の に、雨 が 降っ た。
        english: Even though I went to the trouble of setting my hair, it rained.
        hint: This simply states that it rained. We're looking for an expression that conveys the speaker's
          annoyance or disappointment because the rain ruined their effort.
    scene: You just spent a long time perfecting your hairstyle before heading out. Suddenly, it starts
      raining.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The phrase 「雨に{降られた}」 (ame ni furareta) expresses the speaker's annoyance and regret that
      their effort in setting their hair was wasted due to the unexpected rain. This illustrates how the

          - 弟 に から かわさ れ て、泣い て しまっ た。
        english: I was forced to be made fun of by my younger brother, so I cried.
        hint: This uses the causative-passive, implying the speaker was forced to endure the teasing.
          We're looking for a direct adverse action done *to* the speaker, not one they were forced to
          experience.
    scene: A child is recounting a sad event to their parent.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「からかわれて」 (karakawarete) in the te-form of the adversative passive clearly indicates
      that the speaker (a child) was the unwilling recipient of the younger brother's teasing, leading
      to their crying. The particle 「に」 (ni) marks the agent (弟 - younger brother).
  - english: Oh no, my customer just left!

    scene: You are a salesperson in a shop, and you were just about to approach a customer when they suddenly
      walk out.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The interjection 「しまった」 (shimatta) immediately sets the tone of regret and frustration. 「お客さんに{帰られた}」
      (okyaku-san ni kaerareta) uses the adversative passive to express the speaker's disappointment that
      the customer left before they could make a sale or assist them, implying a missed opportunity or
      inconvenience.
  - english: I was laughed at by everyone.
    japanese:

          - 皆 が 私 を 笑っ た。
        english: Everyone laughed at me.

          feeling associated with it.
    scene: Someone shares an embarrassing moment.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「皆に{笑われた}」 (minna ni warawareta) clearly conveys the speaker's embarrassment and negative
      feeling from being laughed at. The adversative passive emphasizes the impact on the speaker rather
      than simply stating that people laughed.

          conveys the speaker's personal, unwelcome experience of being barked at.
    scene: You're describing an unpleasant incident that happened during your walk.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly

        english: The neighbor's child has been crying all night, so I'm truly troubled.
        hint: This directly states the child is crying and the speaker is troubled, but doesn't use the
          adversative passive. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes the speaker being the direct
          recipient of the nuisance.
    scene: You're complaining to a friend about a sleepless night.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: 「隣の子供に一晩中{泣かれて}」 (tonari no kodomo ni ichibanjuu nakarete) vividly expresses the speaker's
      prolonged suffering and annoyance caused by the neighbor's child crying throughout the night. The

      - competing_japanese:
          - 交差 点 で トラック が 車 に ぶつかっ た。
        english: At the intersection, a truck hit the car.
        hint: This focuses on the truck as the subject of the action. We're looking for an expression
          that emphasizes the car (and implicitly the speaker's possession) as the one negatively affected.
    scene: You're reporting a car accident you were involved in.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「車を{ぶつけられた}」 (kuruma o butsukerareta) uses the adversative passive to convey the speaker's
      personal misfortune and damage to their car. Even though the car is the direct object of the verb,
      the sentence structure implies the speaker's suffering due to the damage to their possession.

        hint: This is an active sentence focusing on the friend's action. We're looking for a sentence
          that emphasizes the speaker's experience of being deceived and the negative feeling associated
          with it.
    scene: You're confiding in someone about a betrayal.

    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「友達に{嘘をつかれた}」 (tomodachi ni uso o tsukareta) highlights the speaker's personal sense of betrayal
      and the negative impact of being lied to by a friend. The adversative passive emphasizes the speaker's
      emotional distress.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, the adversative passive is a versatile construction
  used to express a wide range of negative experiences, from minor annoyances to significant personal
  tragedies. It allows the speaker to naturally convey their emotional involvement and the unwelcome nature
  of an event.
