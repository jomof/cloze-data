    "etymology": "以上 (ijou) literally means \"more than\" or \"above.\" In this grammatical construction, it signifies that something has already been established or reached a certain point, and therefore a particular outcome or action is naturally expected.",
    "writeup": "以上(は) is used to express that, because a certain situation exists, a particular outcome or action is naturally expected or should logically follow. It conveys a sense of commitment or obligation based on a prior action or established state. It is similar to 「からには」 and 「限りは」, but often carries a stronger nuance of logical consequence. While primarily used in formal settings, it can also appear in everyday conversations to emphasize a point. It's often used to express a speaker's determination to do something now that a certain condition has been met. When used with a noun, it takes the form 「〜である以上は」.",

The phrases '～よね' and '～よう' are not exclusively gender-specific, making the previous 'speaker_gender' and 'listener_gender' fields a violation of this strict requirement."
