    "etymology": "This grammar point is a direct application of Japanese sentence structure, where modifiers precede the nouns they describe. 「た」 indicates a completed action, while 「ている」 indicates an ongoing or habitual action.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, you can describe a noun by using a verb phrase that comes before it. This is similar to a relative clause in English. The **た form** (plain past) or **ている form** (continuous) of the verb is used to show the tense or aspect of the action. For example, instead of saying \"Takashi-san is a man. He lives in Tokyo,\" you can combine these into \"Takashi-san is a man who lives in Tokyo.\" The Japanese language simply attaches the verb phrase directly to the noun, without using words like \"that\" or \"which\" as in English.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nThe ます form (polite) of verbs **cannot** be used when making a relative clause.",
