jlpt: N4
etymology: The word 「しばらく」 is believed to have originated from 「しばし」, an older word meaning 'a short time'
  or 'for a moment', combined with the suffix 「らく」, which might be related to 「楽」 (raku) meaning 'ease'
  or 'comfort', or simply a common adverbial suffix. This combination conveys the sense of 'a moment of
  ease' or 'a comfortable short while', which evolved into its current meaning of an indefinite, relatively
  short period.
writeup: |-
  「しばらく」 is a versatile Japanese adverb used to indicate a period of time. Its most common translation is 'for a while' or 'for some time', but its exact duration is highly dependent on the context. It can refer to a brief moment, such as in 「しばらくお待ちください。」 (Please wait for a moment.), or a longer, indefinite period, as in 「しばらく日本に滞在するつもりです。」 (I plan to stay in Japan for a while.).

  One significant and idiomatic use of 「しばらく」 is as a greeting when encountering someone after an absence. In phrases like 「しばらくですね。」 or the more casual 「しばらくね。」, it conveys 'It's been a while (since we last met).' While similar in meaning to 「久しぶり」 in this context, 「しばらく」 can sometimes imply a less specific or less emphatically 'long' absence, focusing more on the fact that some time has passed.

  - term: ちょっと
    meaning: a little, a bit, a short time
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「しばらく」 indicates an indefinite duration, which can be relatively short, 「ちょっと」 more
      specifically denotes a very brief moment or a small quantity, often implying immediate action or
      a slight degree. 「ちょっと」 is generally shorter and more immediate than 「しばらく」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ちょっと (a little)
  - term: 久しぶり
    meaning: after a long time, long time no see
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「久しぶり」 explicitly means 'a long time' and is almost exclusively used to express that a long
      period has passed since a previous event or meeting. 「しばらく」 can be used in greetings with a similar
      meaning ('it's been a while'), but its primary meaning of 'for a while' is more neutral regarding
      the exact length of the duration. 「久しぶり」 implies a *long* absence, whereas 「しばらく」 in other contexts
      can be shorter.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:久しぶり (long time no see)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between 「しばらく」 and 「ちょっと」, remember that 「しばらく」 refers to
  an **indefinite duration**, whereas 「ちょっと」 often refers to a **brief, immediate moment** or a small
  quantity. When greeting someone, if you want to explicitly state that it's been a *long* time, 「久しぶり」
  is the more direct and common choice. 「しばらく」 in a greeting is a more general acknowledgement that time
  has passed.

      - '{しばらく} お 待ち ください。'
      - '{しばらく} 待っ て ください。'

        english: Please wait a moment.
        hint: 「ちょっと」 implies a very brief, often immediate wait, while 「しばらく」 suggests a slightly longer,
          but still indefinite, duration. We're looking for an indefinite period of waiting.

    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one

        english: It's been a long time, hasn't it?
        hint: 「久しぶり」 explicitly means 'a long time', whereas 「しばらく」 in greetings often implies a long
          time but can also be used for shorter, indefinite periods depending on context. We're looking

    scene: Two close friends meet again after some time.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「だね」 makes this phrase very casual and indicates a shared feeling or observation
      between friends. This idiomatic use of 「しばらく」 for 'it's been a while' is common. 「しばらくぶりだね」 adds
      the nuance of 'after a while'.

        english: It's been a long time.
        hint: 「久しぶり」 explicitly states 'a long time', while 「しばらく」 is a more general acknowledgment of

          durations.
    scene: Two colleagues who haven't seen each other in some time exchange greetings.
    register: formal
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The polite copula 「ですね」 makes this a standard, polite greeting used after an absence. It implies
      an acknowledgement of the time that has passed. 「しばらくぶりですね」 adds emphasis on the period 'after a
      while'.
  - english: I haven't been able to see him for a while.

          to various indefinite lengths. We're looking for a general 'for a while'.
    scene: A person expresses their sadness about not being able to meet someone.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「会えていない」 uses the potential form with the negative progressive, indicating a continuous state
      of being unable to meet someone. 「しばらく」 here qualifies the duration of this state. 「会えていません」 is
      the polite form, and 「会ってない」 is casual.

          duration, not necessarily immediate. We're looking for a state of being busy 'for a while'.
    scene: A student informs their friend that they will be preoccupied with studies.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「忙しくなります」 describes a future state of becoming busy, with 「しばらく」 setting the indefinite duration
      for that future period. This shows its use with future changes. 「忙しくなる」 is the casual equivalent.

      - '{しばらく} 休憩 しよう。'
    english_literally: For a while, let's take a break.

        english: Let's take a quick break.
        hint: 「ちょっと」 specifically means 'a little bit' or 'a quick moment', implying a very brief pause.
          「しばらく」 suggests a slightly longer, indefinite period. We're looking for a short but not necessarily
          'quick' break.
    scene: A team leader suggests a break during a long meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: 「休憩しましょう」 is a polite suggestion to take a break. In this context, 「しばらく」 implies a relatively
      short, refreshing pause, emphasizing the temporary nature of the break. 「休憩しよう」 is the casual form.

      - competing_japanese:
          - すぐ に は 戻り ませ ん。
        english: I won't be back immediately.
        hint: 「すぐには」 implies that the return won't be immediate, but doesn't specify a duration like 「しばらく」
          does. We're looking for a statement about not returning 'for a while'.
    scene: Someone is leaving and informing others of their extended absence.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: This example demonstrates 「しばらく」 used with negative statements, indicating a duration during
      which an action will *not* occur or a state will *not* exist. 「戻らない」 is the plain negative form,
      suitable for casual contexts.
  - english: I hadn't been drinking alcohol for a while.

      - '{しばらく} お 酒 を 飲ん で い ませ ん でし た。'

      - competing_japanese:
          - 以前 は お 酒 を 飲ん で い ませ ん でし た。
        english: Previously, I hadn't been drinking alcohol.
        hint: 「以前は」 means 'previously' or 'before', referring to a point in the past but not necessarily
          a continuous duration. 「しばらく」 specifies 'for a while' within that past period. We're looking
          for a specific duration of not drinking.
    scene: A person explains their past habits regarding alcohol consumption.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「飲んでいませんでした」 uses the past progressive negative, indicating a state of not drinking that continued
      for 「しばらく」 in the past. This highlights its use for past continuous negative states. 「飲んでなかった」 is
      the casual form.
  - english: I plan to stay in Japan for a while.
    japanese:
      - '{しばらく} 日本 に 滞在 する つもり です。'
      - '{しばらく} 日本 に 滞在 する つもり だ。'
    english_literally: For a while, to Japan, intend to stay.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 短い 間 日本 に 滞在 する つもり です。
        english: I plan to stay in Japan for a short period.
        hint: 「短い間」 explicitly states 'a short period'. While 「しばらく」 can sometimes refer to a short time,
          it emphasizes indefiniteness. We're looking for an indefinite 'for a while'.
    scene: A foreign student informs their host family about their plans.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「滞在するつもりです」 indicates an intention, and 「しばらく」 specifies the intended duration of that stay,
      showing its application to future plans. 「滞在するつもりだ」 is the casual form.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「しばらく」 is incredibly versatile. It serves to indicate
  a temporary duration for actions, states, or even to express a sentiment of time passed when used as
  a greeting. The specific length of 'a while' will always be understood from the surrounding conversation
  and context.
