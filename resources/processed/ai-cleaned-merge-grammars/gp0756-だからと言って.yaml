    },
    "etymology": "「だから」 (dakara) means \"therefore\" or \"so\". 「と」 (to) is a particle indicating a conditional or quotative meaning. 「言って」 (itte) is the te-form of 「言う」 (iu), meaning \"to say\". Together, 「だからと言って」 literally translates to \"even if you say 'therefore'.\" This phrase encapsulates the idea of acknowledging a premise while simultaneously refuting an expected or assumed consequence of that premise.",
    "writeup": "「だからと言って」 (dakara to itte) is a conjunction used to express that even if a certain premise or situation is true, the expected conclusion does not necessarily follow. It's similar to saying \"just because... doesn't mean...\" or \"even so.\" This grammatical structure effectively introduces a contrasting perspective, challenging a common assumption that might arise from the initial statement.\n\nIt often precedes a statement that contrasts with what might be expected based on the initial premise. For example, if someone is known to be bad at something, one might assume they are not intelligent. However, 「だからと言って」 can be used to deny such an extrapolation, emphasizing that the initial premise does not automatically lead to the presumed conclusion.\n\nThis phrase is frequently followed by expressions that negate the expected outcome, such as 「～わけではない」 (wake de wa nai - it doesn't mean) or 「～とは限らない」 (to wa kagiranai - it's not necessarily the case), which further reinforce the speaker's reservation or contrasting opinion. It is a versatile expression found in both spoken and written Japanese.",

            "nuance": "While both introduce a reason, 「からと言って」 primarily functions to establish a cause or reason for something, often implying that despite this reason, a certain outcome might not occur. 「だからと言って」, on the other hand, emphasizes the *disconnect* between a stated premise and a commonly inferred conclusion, explicitly challenging the logical jump. It is more assertive in its refutation of an expected outcome."
