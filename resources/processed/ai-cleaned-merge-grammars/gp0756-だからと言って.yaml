        "usage-context": "Used to present a contrasting view or reservation after stating a reason or premise, indicating that an expected conclusion does not necessarily follow from the initial statement.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the expected conclusion from the stated premise does not automatically follow, often challenging a common assumption."
    },
    "etymology": "「だから」 (dakara) means \"therefore\" or \"so\". 「と」 (to) is a particle indicating a conditional or quotative meaning. 「言って」 (itte) is the te-form of 「言う」 (iu), meaning \"to say\". Together, 「だからと言って」 literally translates to \"even if you say 'therefore'.\" This phrase encapsulates the idea of acknowledging a premise while simultaneously refuting an expected or assumed consequence of that premise.",
    "writeup": "「だからと言って」 (dakara to itte) is a conjunction used to express that even if a certain premise or situation is true, the expected conclusion does not necessarily follow. It's similar to saying \"just because... doesn't mean...\" or \"even so.\" This grammatical structure effectively introduces a contrasting perspective, challenging a common assumption that might arise from the initial statement.\n\nIt often precedes a statement that contrasts with what might be expected based on the initial premise. For example, if someone is known to be bad at something, one might assume they are not intelligent. However, 「だからと言って」 can be used to deny such an extrapolation, emphasizing that the initial premise does not automatically lead to the presumed conclusion.\n\nThis phrase is frequently followed by expressions that negate the expected outcome, such as 「～わけではない」 (wake de wa nai - it doesn't mean) or 「～とは限らない」 (to wa kagiranai - it's not necessarily the case), which further reinforce the speaker's reservation or contrasting opinion. It is a versatile expression found in both spoken and written Japanese.",
