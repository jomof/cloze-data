        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "nuance": "「やっと」 indicates that an event occurred after a long wait or with great effort, often conveying a sense of relief or satisfaction. It can also mean 'barely' or 'just enough' when describing a minimum requirement or capacity being met. This sense of relief or just-enough is often implied.",
        "source": "DOJG",
        "colocation": "Often collocates with verbs expressing completion, achievement, or reaching a state (e.g., 終わる, 間に合う, できる, 着く).",

        "logical-flow": "Implies a preceding period of waiting or difficulty.",
        "temporal-flow": "Indicates the culmination of an event after a certain duration.",
        "spatial-flow": "Can sometimes refer to a minimum spatial requirement being met."
    },
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「やっと」 is uncertain, but it is believed to be related to the verb 「止む (yamu)」, meaning \"to stop.\" The idea is that after a long period of something continuing, it finally stops or comes to an end, allowing something else to happen.",
    "writeup": "「やっと」 is an adverb used to express that something desirable has finally happened after a long wait, much effort, or some difficulty. It conveys a strong sense of relief or satisfaction that a goal has been reached, even if it was challenging. It can also mean \"barely\" or \"just enough,\" indicating that a minimum requirement has been met or that one's ability is at its limit.\n\nThis adverb is versatile and can be used in both casual and polite speech. While it can often be interchangeable with 「ようやく」, 「やっと」 tends to carry a stronger emotional nuance of relief or personal accomplishment. When used to mean \"barely,\" it highlights the narrowness of the margin or the extreme effort involved to meet a condition.\n\nIt is distinct from 「とうとう」, which often implies an inevitable or expected outcome, and 「かろうじて」, which strictly focuses on the narrow margin of success, rather than the emotional relief or simple achievement after waiting.",
