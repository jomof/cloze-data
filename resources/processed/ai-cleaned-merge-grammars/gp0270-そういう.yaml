        "nuance": "Implies a shared understanding or direct reference to a characteristic, manner, or type previously observed, mentioned, or understood by both parties. It can sometimes convey an implicit judgment or observation about the 'kind' of thing being discussed.",
        "grammatical-role": "Pre-noun adjectival modifier"
    },
    "etymology": "「そう」 is a demonstrative adverb indicating \"that way\" or \"that manner.\" 「いう」 is the dictionary form of the verb 「言う (iu)」, meaning \"to say.\" Thus, 「そういう」 literally means \"saying that way,\" but idiomatically, it's used to describe something that is of that particular type or manner.",
    "writeup": "「そういう」 is a pre-noun adjectival phrase used to describe a type or kind of something. It translates to \"like that,\" \"that kind of,\" or \"of that sort.\" It is part of the extensive こそあど言葉 (kosoado kotoba) family, which encompasses demonstrative words for location, direction, and manner. Specifically, 「こういう」, 「そういう」, 「ああいう」, and 「どういう」 are formed by combining the demonstrative adverbs こう (this way), そう (that way), ああ (that way over there), and どう (what way) with the verb 「言う (iu)」 (to say). While literally meaning \"saying that way,\" they are idiomatically used to describe something that is of a particular type or manner.\n\n*   **こう いう** (kou iu): Refers to something of 'this kind' or 'this sort', pertaining to something close to the speaker.\n*   **そう いう** (sou iu): Refers to something of 'that kind' or 'that sort', pertaining to something close to the listener or previously mentioned/understood by both parties.\n*   **ああ いう** (aa iu): Refers to something of 'that kind over there' or 'that sort', pertaining to something distant from both speaker and listener.\n*   **どう いう** (dou iu): Asks 'what kind of' or 'what sort of'.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish the adverb そう (often written with the kanji 然う, although typically in hiragana), used in 「そういう」, from the auxiliary verb そう. The auxiliary verb そう attaches to verb stems or adjective roots to mean \"it seems\" or \"I hear\" and does not have a kanji form.",
