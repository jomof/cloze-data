    "etymology": "「そう」 is a demonstrative adverb indicating \"that way\" or \"that manner.\" 「いう」is the dictionary form of the verb 「言う (iu)」, meaning \"to say.\" Thus, 「そういう」 literally means \"saying that way,\" but idiomatically, it's used to describe something that is of that particular type or manner.",
    "writeup": "「そういう」 is a pre-noun adjectival phrase used to describe a type or kind of something. It translates to \"like that,\" \"that kind of,\" or \"of that sort.\" It's part of the こそあど言葉 family, relating to things closer to the listener than the speaker. It's used directly before a noun to specify the type or characteristic being discussed.\n\n*   **こういう** (koiu): this kind of\n*   **ああいう** (aaiu): that kind of (over there)\n*   **どういう** (douiu): what kind of",
