    "etymology": "The grammar point 「だけでなく(て)〜も」 is constructed from fundamental Japanese elements. 「だけ」 (dake) signifies \"only\" or \"just\". 「でなく(て)」 (de naku(te)) is the negative conjunctive form of the copula 「だ」 (da), meaning \"not being\" or \"not existing\". When combined, 「だけでなく(て)」 literally translates to \"not only being/existing\". The addition of 「も」 (mo), meaning \"also\" or \"too\", serves to emphasize the inclusive nature of the second clause, thereby creating the complete meaning of \"not only X, but also Y.\"",
    "writeup": "The structure 「だけでなく(て)〜も」 serves to express the idea of \"not only A, but also B.\" It asserts that both elements, A and B, are applicable or true. The core component, 「だけでなく」, establishes the \"not only\" aspect. The subsequent inclusion of the particle 「も」 (mo) in the second clause provides emphasis on the \"also\" part, highlighting that the second element is an additional, often equally significant, inclusion.\n\nThe optional 「て」 in 「だけでなく(て)」 functions as a connective, facilitating a smoother flow between clauses. Its presence often lends a more natural, conversational tone. Without 「て」, the form 「でなく」 is generally perceived as more formal or characteristic of written Japanese.\n\nIt is important to note that 「でなく(て)」 can often be substituted with the more colloquial 「じゃなく(て)」, especially in casual speech, without altering the fundamental meaning. The choice between 「なく」 and 「なくて」, or 「じゃなく」 and 「じゃなくて」, primarily depends on the desired level of formality and the specific communicative context.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these expressions share the general idea of \"not only... but also,\" each carries distinct nuances. Use 「だけでなく(て)〜も」 when you want to emphasize the inclusion of a second item, often with equal weight to the first. For more formal or written contexts, 「のみならず」 is suitable. If the first item is inherently obvious or a given, 「はもちろん」 would be more appropriate. When the first item acts as a representative example of a broader category, 「をはじめ」 is the correct choice.
