    "etymology": "まで is thought to have originated from the verb 「待つ」 (matsu), meaning \"to wait.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate the end point or limit of waiting, eventually becoming the particle we know today.",
    "writeup": "まで is a particle that indicates a limit in time or extent. When attached to a verb in its dictionary form, まで signifies that an action continues **until** a certain event or point in time occurs. It's crucial to remember that the verb preceding まで is in its dictionary form (non-past) because the sentence describes an action continuing *up to* a certain point, not *after* it. The tense of the overall sentence is usually determined by the verb that follows. While まで can also be used with nouns to indicate a physical limit, this grammar point specifically focuses on its usage with verbs, where it conveys the continuation of an action up to the point the verb's event occurs. This particle is commonly used across various registers.",

For example, in 「授業が始まるまで、先生が来なかった」 (The teacher didn't come until the class started), the verb 「始まる」 (to start) is non-past, but the main action 「来なかった」 (didn't come) is in the past tense.
