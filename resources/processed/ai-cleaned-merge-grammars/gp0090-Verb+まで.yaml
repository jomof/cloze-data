    "etymology": "まで is thought to have originated from the verb 「待つ」 (matsu), meaning \"to wait.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate the end point or limit of waiting, eventually becoming the particle we know today, signifying a boundary or extent.",
    "writeup": "まで is a particle that indicates a limit in time or extent. When attached to a verb in its dictionary form, まで signifies that an action continues **until** a certain event or point in time occurs. It's crucial to remember that the verb preceding まで is always in its dictionary (non-past) form. This is because the sentence describes an action or state continuing *up to* a certain point, not *after* it. The actual tense of the overall sentence, if describing a completed action, is determined by the main verb that follows. For example, in 「授業が始まるまで、先生が来なかった」 (The teacher didn't come until the class started), the verb 「始まる」 (to start) is non-past, but the main action 「来なかった」 (didn't come) is in the past tense. This structure accurately conveys that the teacher's absence continued up to the point the class started. This particle is commonly used across various registers, from casual to formal.",

Similarly, conditionals like 「〜たら」 describe an outcome that follows or is dependent on an event, rather than anugin an action leading up to it.

    "post_example_writeup": "The usage of まで with verbs always requires the verb to be in its dictionary (non-past) form. This is a common point of initial confusion for learners who might try to match the tense of the preceding verb with the tense of the main clause. However, the particle まで inherently defines the temporal boundary *up to* which an action or state continues. The overall tense of the sentence is determined by the final verb in the main clause. Mastering this distinction is key to accurately conveying durations and limits in Japanese.",
