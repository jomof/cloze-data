    "etymology": "まで is thought to have originated from the verb 「待つ」 (matsu), meaning \"to wait.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate the end point or limit of waiting, eventually becoming the particle we know today.",
    "writeup": "まで is a particle that indicates a limit in time or extent. When attached to a verb in its dictionary form, まで signifies that an action continues **until** a certain event or point in time occurs. It's crucial to remember that the verb preceding まで is in its dictionary form (non-past) because the sentence describes an action continuing *up to* a certain point, not *after* it. The tense of the overall sentence is usually determined by the verb that follows. In addition to verbs, まで can be used with nouns to indicate a physical limit, similar to the particle に, meaning something goes *to* a place, but no further.",
