    "etymology": "まで is thought to have originated from the verb 「待つ」 (matsu), meaning \"to wait.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate the end point or limit of waiting, eventually becoming the particle we know today, signifying a boundary or extent.",
    "writeup": "まで is a particle that indicates a limit in time or extent. When attached to a verb in its dictionary form, まで signifies that an action continues **until** a certain event or point in time occurs. It's crucial to remember that the verb preceding まで is always in its dictionary (non-past) form. This is because the sentence describes an action or state continuing *up to* a certain point, not *after* it. The actual tense of the overall sentence, if describing a completed action, is determined by the main verb that follows. For example, in 「授業が始まるまで、先生が来なかった」 (The teacher didn't come until the class started), the verb 「始まる」 (to start) is non-past, but the main action 「来なかった」 (didn't come) is in the past tense. This structure accurately conveys that the teacher's absence continued up to the point the class started. This particle is commonly used across various registers, from casual to formal.",

                    "mitigation": "Using 「〜たら」 (conditional) would imply waiting *after* the teacher arrives, or waiting *if* they arrive, which doesn't convey the continuous state of waiting *until* the specific event. The scene emphasizes waiting *throughout the period* until the teacher's arrival, which {まで} naturally expresses."
