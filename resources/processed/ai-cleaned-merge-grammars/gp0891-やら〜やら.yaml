    "etymology": "The particle 「やら」 is thought to originate from the verb 「やる (yaru)」, meaning \"to do\". Over time, it evolved to express uncertainty or to list examples in a non-exhaustive manner.",
    "writeup": "The 「やら〜やら」 structure is used to present a non-exhaustive list of items, actions, or feelings. It conveys a sense of \"and so on\" or \"things like that.\" It's similar to 「など」 or 「とか」, but 「やら」 often emphasizes that the listed items are just a small part of a larger, more complex situation. You can use it with nouns, verbs in their dictionary form, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives. When you repeat 「やら」 as in 「A やら B やら」, 「A」 and 「B」 are usually the same type of word, but this isn't a strict requirement, especially when expressing emotions. There is another construction,「のやら〜のやら」, which emphasizes that the speaker is unsure which option is correct.",
