    "etymology": "The particle 「やら」 is derived from the verb 「やる」 (yaru), meaning \"to do.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate a sense of uncertainty, approximation, or listing of possibilities.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「やら〜やら」 is used to express a sense of uncertainty, approximation, or to list possibilities. It's similar to 「など」, often translating to \"and so on,\" \"things like,\" or \"whether...or.\" It can follow verbs in dictionary form, nouns, *i*-adjectives, or *na*-adjectives. When repeated as 「AやらBやら」, A and B are usually the same type of word. Compared to 「とか」, 「やら」 emphasizes the breadth of the category. When used as 「のやら〜のやら」, it emphasizes that the speaker is unsure which option is correct.",
