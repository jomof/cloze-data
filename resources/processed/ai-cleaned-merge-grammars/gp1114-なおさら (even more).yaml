jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: semi-formal
  function: Emphasizes that something is true to an even greater degree because of a particular reason
    or circumstance.
  nuance: It's stronger than もっと or さらに and implies a significant increase in degree or intensity.
  logical-flow: Used to intensify a pre-existing state or condition, directly attributing the amplification
    to a stated cause or context. It implies that the reason makes the outcome 'all the more' true or
    intense.
  temporal-flow: The intensifying effect is often immediately felt or realized after the causal factor
    is introduced.
  spatial-flow: While not directly spatial, it can imply a 'deepening' or 'widening' of a state, pushing
    it further along a conceptual continuum.
etymology: The word なおさら is thought to come from 猶更 (nao sara), where 猶 (nao) means "still, yet" and 更
  (sara) means "more, further". Thus, the combination implies an increase or intensification, often suggesting
  that something is 'all the more' true or intense due to a specific preceding condition or reason. It
  evolved to emphasize an intensified degree beyond what might already be expected.
writeup: なおさら is an adverb that emphasizes the degree of something, indicating it is "even more" or "still
  more" than before due to a specific reason or circumstance. It conveys a stronger sense of intensification
  than words like もっと or さらに. It's used to highlight how a condition or feeling is amplified. While adaptable
  to various situations, it often appears in more formal or semi-formal settings. It functions by building
  upon an existing state or situation, suggesting that a new factor or condition causes that state to
  increase significantly. Think of it as adding fuel to an already burning fire; なおさら emphasizes the added
  intensity. It's particularly effective when you want to highlight how a specific cause leads to a disproportionately
  large or notable increase in a certain state or quality. When used to describe feelings, it implies
  an internal amplification of emotion.
false_friends:
  - term: さらに
    meaning: Furthermore, moreover, even more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: さらに also means "even more" but is less emphatic than なおさら and doesn't necessarily imply a
      specific reason for the increase.
    grammar_point: 更に (even more)
  - term: 一層 (いっそう)
    meaning: Much more, still more, all the more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While similar in meaning, 一層 can be used in a broader range of situations and doesn't always
      emphasize a cause as directly as なおさら does.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:一層 (much more, still more)
  - term: もっと
    meaning: More
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: もっと is a general expression for "more" and doesn't carry the implication of an added circumstance
      like なおさら does.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:もっと (more)
post_false_friends_writeup: When deciding between なおさら, さらに, 一層, and もっと, consider the level of emphasis
  and whether you want to highlight a specific reason or condition that amplifies the degree. なおさら is
  most appropriate when you want to emphasize that something is true to an even greater extent because
  of a particular reason or circumstance. さらに is a general "more". 一層 is similar to なおさら but less directly
  tied to a preceding condition. もっと は simply "more" without the added nuance.
examples:
  - english: I already wanted to go to Japan, but after my friend highly recommended it, I want to go
      even more.
    japanese:
      - 前 から 日本 に 行き たい と 思っ て い た が、友達 が とても 勧め た の で、{なおさら} 行き たく なっ た。
      - 前 から 日本 に 行き たい と 思っ て おり まし た が、友達 が とても 勧め た の で、{なおさら} 行き たく なり まし た。
      - 前 から 日本 に 行き たかっ た ん だ けど、友達 が すごく 勧め て くれ た から、{なおさら} 行き たく なっ ちゃっ た。
    english_literally: From before, I wanted to go to Japan, but since my friend strongly recommended
      it, I became even more wanting to go.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もっと 行き たく なっ た。
        english: I wanted to go more.
        hint: This is a general increase. We're looking for an increase due to a specific, amplifying
          reason. The original sentence highlights that the friend's recommendation *further* intensified
          an already existing desire, not just increased it in a general sense. We're looking for a word
          that emphasizes this additional push or intensification due to a specific cause, making the
          desire 'even more so'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - さらに 行き たく なっ た。
        english: I wanted to go still more.
        hint: This indicates further progression. We're looking for an amplified state caused by a distinct
          circumstance. The nuance in the original Japanese points to the friend's recommendation as a
          direct cause for the heightened desire. While 「さらに」 can mean 'further,' it doesn't always convey
          the direct causal link and intensified degree as strongly as 「なおさら」 does, especially when a
          pre-existing state is being exacerbated. We're looking for a word that implies that the friend's
          action served as an additional, intensifying factor, making the desire 'even more so'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一層 行き たく なっ た。
        english: I wanted to go much more.
        hint: This emphasizes a greater degree. We're looking for an intensified state linked to a particular
          event. 「一層」, while meaning 'much more,' often describes a quantitative increase or a general
          heightening of a state. In the original sentence, the emphasis is on the fact that the friend's
          recommendation *added* to the existing desire, making it 'even more so' than before, implying
          a specific cause-and-effect that 「一層」 might not always capture. We're looking for a word that
          conveys the idea of an intensified state specifically triggered by the friend's recommendation.
    scene: A friend recommending a travel destination.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: なおさら is used to emphasize the increased desire to go to Japan after hearing the recommendation
      from a friend. The phrase implies that the recommendation didn't just increase the desire, but amplified
      an already existing one, making it 'all the more' strong. The informal verb ending 「なっちゃった」 further
      conveys the speaker's personal feeling and excitement.
  - english: Since the deadline is approaching, I must work even harder.
    japanese:
      - 締め切り が 近づい て いる から、{なおさら} 頑張ら なけれ ば なら ない。

    english_literally: Since the deadline is approaching, even more I must work hard.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もっと 頑張ら なけれ ば なら ない。
        english: I must work harder.
        hint: This is a simple increase in effort. We're looking for an emphasis on the urgency and added
          motivation due to the approaching deadline, making the need for effort 'all the more' pressing.
          The original sentence implies that the deadline is the specific reason *why* the effort must
          be intensified, not just generally increased. We're looking for a word that highlights this
          causal link and the resulting amplified necessity.
    scene: A student or professional facing a looming deadline.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: Here, なおさら emphasizes that the approaching deadline is the specific reason for the *intensified*
      need to work hard. It's not just working harder in general, but working 'even more' due to the external
      pressure. The formal conjugation 「頑張らなければなりません」 reinforces the sense of obligation.
  - english: The weather was already bad, but with the sudden heavy rain, it became even worse.
    japanese:
      - 天気 は 元々 悪かっ た が、急 な 大雨 で {なおさら} ひどく なっ た。
      - 天気 は 元々 悪かっ た の です が、急 な 大雨 で {なおさら} ひどく なり まし た。
    english_literally: The weather was originally bad, but with sudden heavy rain, it became even more
      severe.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もっと ひどく なっ た。
        english: It became worse.
        hint: This is a general worsening. We're looking for a word that highlights how the heavy rain
          *exacerbated* an already poor condition, making it 'all the more' miserable. The original sentence
          emphasizes the specific impact of the heavy rain on the pre-existing bad weather. We're looking
          for a word that conveys this sense of an existing negative state being intensified by a new,
          specific factor.
    scene: Someone observing the weather from indoors.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: なおさら here points to the heavy rain as the specific factor that made an already bad situation
      'even more' terrible. It conveys a sense of unfortunate intensification. The plain past tense 「ひどくなった」
      makes the observation direct and impactful.
  - english: He's usually quiet, so when he spoke with such confidence, it was all the more surprising.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 普段 静か だ から、あんな に 自信 を 持っ て 話し た 時 は {なおさら} 驚い た。
      - 彼 は 普段 静か です から、あんな に 自信 を 持っ て 話し た 時 は {なおさら} 驚き まし た。
    english_literally: He is usually quiet, so when he spoke with such confidence, even more I was surprised.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - とても 驚い た。
        english: I was very surprised.
        hint: This indicates a high degree of surprise. We're looking for a word that emphasizes that
          the surprise was *amplified* because it came from someone usually quiet, making it 'all the
          more' unexpected. The original sentence highlights the contrast between his usual demeanor and
          his confident speech, which intensified the reaction. We're looking for a word that conveys
          this heightened reaction due to a specific, contrasting characteristic.
    scene: A colleague discussing another colleague's unexpected behavior.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: Using なおさら emphasizes that the surprise was not just 'very' surprising, but 'all the more'
      surprising because of the speaker's quiet nature. It highlights the unexpectedness given his usual
      state. The use of 「普段静かだから」 as the reason directly sets up the intensified surprise.
  - english: It's difficult for a child to understand, so for a toddler, it's even more impossible.
    japanese:
      - 子供 に は 難しい から、幼児 に は {なおさら} 無理 だ。
      - 子供 に は 難しい です から、幼児 に は {なおさら} 無理 です。
    english_literally: For a child, it is difficult, so for a toddler, it is even more impossible.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もっと 無理 だ。
        english: It's more impossible.
        hint: This implies a simple increase in difficulty. We're looking for a word that emphasizes the
          *inherent impossibility* for a toddler, building on the difficulty for a child, making it 'all
          the more' out of reach. The original sentence draws a stronger contrast, indicating that if
          it's hard for a child, it's exponentially harder for a toddler due to their developmental stage.
          We're looking for a word that conveys this amplified impossibility rooted in a logical progression.
    scene: A parent or educator discussing developmental stages with someone.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: なおさら here emphasizes that if something is difficult for a child, it is 'even more' impossible
      for a toddler, highlighting the greater degree of impossibility given the toddler's developmental
      stage. 「無理だ」 is a strong expression, and なおさら amplifies it further. This is an example of Noun +
      だから、なおさら.
  - english: Studying abroad is an adventure, but when you do it alone, it becomes even more challenging.
    japanese:
      - 留学 は 冒険 だ が、一人 で 行く と {なおさら} 大変 に なる。
      - 留学 は 冒険 です が、一人 で 行く と {なおさら} 大変 に なり ます。
    english_literally: Studying abroad is an adventure, but if one goes alone, it becomes even more difficult.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もっと 大変 に なる。
        english: It becomes more challenging.
        hint: This is a straightforward increase in difficulty. We're looking for a word that highlights
          how the act of going alone *intensifies* the inherent adventurousness of studying abroad, making
          it 'all the more' daunting. The original sentence implies that loneliness or self-reliance adds
          another layer of challenge that goes beyond a mere quantitative increase. We're looking for
          a word that captures this amplified sense of struggle due to a specific contributing factor.
    scene: A conversation about the challenges of studying abroad.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: This sentence uses the `X は Y だが、Z になると、なおさら` pattern. なおさら highlights that going alone significantly

      the added burden or intensity due to the solitary nature of the experience.

          - すごく クタクタ に なっ た。

        hint: This emphasizes a high degree of exhaustion. We're looking for a word that shows how the
          busy workday *compounded* an existing tiredness, leading to an 'all the more' extreme state
          of exhaustion. The original sentence draws a clear connection between the cause (busy day) and
          the amplified effect (extreme exhaustion), implying that the existing tiredness was pushed to
          a new level. We're looking for a word that indicates this intensified state as a result of a
          specific event.
    scene: Someone reflecting on their day after work.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: なおさら emphasizes the amplification of tiredness into extreme exhaustion specifically due to
      the busy workday. It's not just 'very tired,' but 'all the more' utterly worn out. The casual 「クタクタ」
      reinforces the feeling. This is an example of `X + から、なおさら + Y` implied by the context.
  - english: He doesn't usually make mistakes, so his current carelessness is all the more regrettable.
    japanese:

        hint: This indicates a high degree of regret. We're looking for a word that emphasizes the regret
          is *amplified* because the person rarely makes mistakes, making the current carelessness 'all
          the more' disappointing. The original sentence highlights the contrast between the person's
          usual reliability and their current lapse, which makes the situation more impactful. We're looking
          for a word that conveys this heightened sense of regret due to a specific, surprising deviation
          from the norm.
    scene: A manager discussing an employee's unusual performance.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The use of なおさら here indicates that the carelessness is 'all the more' regrettable precisely
      because it is uncharacteristic of him. It highlights the increased disappointment due to the deviation
      from his usual reliability. This is an example of `Verb[plain] + から、なおさら`.

          the more' arduous. The original sentence conveys that inflation directly worsened an already
          challenging situation. We're looking for a word that highlights this specific cause-and-effect
          relationship leading to an amplified state.
    scene: People discussing economic conditions.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: なおさら here implies that inflation has intensified an already challenging living situation,
      making it 'even more' difficult. It points to the specific cause (inflation) for the amplified hardship.

      - 彼 ら の 成功 の ニュース を お 聞き に なれ ば、あなた も {なおさら} 頑張る 気 に なら れる でしょ う。
    english_literally: If you hear the news of their success, you too will even more feel like working

    competing_grammar:

        english: If you hear the news of their success, you will feel more motivated to work hard.
        hint: This is a simple increase in motivation. We're looking for a word that indicates their success
          will *significantly boost* your existing drive, making you 'all the more' determined. The original
          sentence suggests a strong, perhaps surprising, surge of motivation triggered by external inspiration.
          We're looking for a word that conveys this amplified emotional response linked to a specific
          stimulus.
    scene: An older mentor giving advice to a younger person.
    register: formal
    setting: inspirational
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This example uses なおさら to predict an amplified sense of motivation. The speaker believes that
      the news of success will not just motivate, but *further strengthen* an existing drive to work hard,
      making it 'all the more' intense. The use of the volitional form 「頑張る気になるだろう」 combined with the
      conditional 「聞けば」 creates a strong, encouraging tone. The formal polite form 「お聞きになれば」 and 「なられるでしょう」
      for the listener is a characteristic of an older male speaking respectfully to a younger male.
  - english: Even though I finished the project, because of the strict deadline, I felt the pressure even
      more.
    japanese:
      - プロジェクト は 終わっ た けど、厳しい 締め切り だっ た から、{なおさら} プレッシャー を 感じ た。
      - プロジェクト は 終わり まし た が、厳しい 締め切り でし た から、{なおさら} プレッシャー を 感じ まし た。
    english_literally: The project finished, but because it was a strict deadline, even more I felt pressure.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - プロジェクト は 終わっ た けど、厳しい 締め切り だっ た から、とても プレッシャー を 感じ た。
        english: This describes a high amount of pressure. We're looking for a word that indicates the
          strict deadline *intensified* the pressure beyond a normal level, making it 'all the more' stressful,
          even after completion.
        hint: This describes a high amount of pressure. We're looking for a word that indicates the strict
          deadline *intensified* the pressure beyond a normal level, making it 'all the more' stressful,
          even after completion. The original sentence implies that the strictness of the deadline directly
          contributed to an amplified feeling of pressure, emphasizing the causal link. We're looking
          for a word that conveys this heightened emotional state due to a specific, aggravating factor.
    scene: A team member reflecting on a recently completed project.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: なおさら emphasizes that the pressure felt was 'even more' intense due to the *strictness* of
      the deadline, rather than just the deadline itself. It highlights how an inherent quality (strictness)
      of the circumstance amplified the feeling. This example demonstrates `X + から、なおさら + Y` where X describes
      the condition.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how なおさら intensifies a state or feeling due to a particular,
  often aggravating or enhancing, circumstance. It goes beyond merely stating an increase, conveying a
  sense that the preceding condition makes the subsequent situation *even more* pronounced or true.
