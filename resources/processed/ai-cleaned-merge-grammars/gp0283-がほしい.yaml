    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「がほしい」 is derived from the *i*-adjective 「欲しい」 (hoshii), which means \"wanted\" or \"desired.\" The 「が」 particle marks the object of desire. This construction exemplifies how Japanese adjectives directly convey states of being or desire, with the particle 「が」 indicating the subject or object of that state.",
    "writeup": "The 「がほしい」 grammar point is used to express a desire for a **thing** (noun). 「欲しい」 (hoshii) is an *i*-adjective, and therefore it conjugates just like any other *i*-adjective.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that this construction is exclusively for expressing a desire for objects or concepts (nouns). When you wish to express a desire to *perform an action* (a verb), you must use the 「〜たい」 form. For example, to say \"I want to eat,\" you would use 「食べたい」 (tabetai), not 「ご飯が欲しい」 (gohan ga hoshii), which would mean \"I want rice\" (the noun).\n\nFurthermore, 「がほしい」 primarily expresses the speaker's own desires. To discuss someone else's desires, especially if you are observing their inclination or appearance of wanting something, you would typically use the 「〜がる」 or 「〜たがる」 forms. For instance, 「彼は新しい車を欲しがっている」 (Kare wa atarashii kuruma o hoshigatte iru) means \"He seems to want a new car.\"\n\nAn important related construction is 「〜てほしい」. While 「がほしい」 is about wanting a noun, 「〜てほしい」 is used when you want *another person to perform an action* for you. For example, 「手伝ってほしい」 (Tetsudatte hoshii) means \"I want you to help me.\" This is distinct from wanting the *thing* \"help\" itself.",
