    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないでもない」 is formed by negating a negative. The structure literally translates to \"it's not that it's not,\" indicating a double negative construction. This implies a partial or hesitant affirmation. It suggests that while something may not be entirely true or agreeable, there is still some element of truth or acceptance.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ないでもない」, and its less common variant 「なくもない」, are used to express a hesitant affirmation or possibility. Literally, it means \"it's not that it's not,\" suggesting a double negative. It is used when the speaker wants to express a partial agreement or acknowledge a possibility without fully committing to it.\n\n*   **Meaning**: Expresses \"kind of,\" \"might,\" \"slightly,\" \"it's not impossible that,\" \"somewhat,\" or \"in some respects.\"\n*   **Usage**: Used when the speaker cannot fully confirm or deny something or when they want to soften their disagreement.\n*   **Interchangeability**: 「ないでもない」 and 「なくもない」 are mostly interchangeable, though 「なくもない」 is less frequently used. 「ないものでもない」 is also seen but is even less common.\n\nIt's important to understand the nuance of 「ないでもない」 to convey the intended hesitation or partial agreement in your Japanese conversations.",
