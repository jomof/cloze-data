    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないでもない」 is formed by negating a negative, literally meaning \"not not be.\" This double negative construction creates a nuance of hesitant affirmation or possibility, suggesting that while something might not be entirely true or false, there is a degree of truth or possibility. It's akin to saying 'it's not impossible' or 'it's not that I don't...'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ないでもない」, literally meaning \"not not be,\" expresses a hesitant affirmation, possibility, or mild agreement. It indicates that something is \"kind of,\" \"might be,\" or \"somewhat\" true. Think of it as a way of saying you don't completely disagree, or that you see a possibility, however slight. This grammar point is often used in situations where the speaker can neither fully confirm nor deny something, or when they want to express a nuanced agreement without being overly direct.\n\nIt is formed by attaching 「ないでもない」 to the negative form of a verb (e.g., 行かない + ないでもない → 行かないでもない) or a noun followed by the case-marking particle が (e.g., できない + ないでもない → できないでもない). While it creates a double negative, the overall meaning leans towards a cautious positive. For instance, 「分からないでもない」 doesn't mean 'I don't understand' but rather 'I kind of understand' or 'it's not that I don't understand'.\n\n「なくもない」 is an interchangeable variation, though it is less frequently used. Both structures are fundamentally similar in their nuanced expression of possibility or reluctant agreement.",
