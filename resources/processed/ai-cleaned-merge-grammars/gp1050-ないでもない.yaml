    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないでもない」 is formed by negating a negative, literally meaning \"not not be.\" This double negative construction creates a nuance of hesitant affirmation or possibility, suggesting that while something might not be entirely true or false, there is a degree of truth or possibility. It's akin to saying 'it's not impossible' or 'it's not that I don't...'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ないでもない」, literally meaning \"not not be,\" expresses a hesitant affirmation, possibility, or mild agreement. It indicates that something is \"kind of,\" \"might be,\" or \"somewhat\" true. Think of it as a way of saying you don't completely disagree, or that you see a possibility, however slight. This grammar point is often used in situations where the speaker can neither fully confirm nor deny something, or when they want to express a nuanced agreement without being overly direct.\n\nIt is formed by attaching 「ないでもない」 to the negative form of a verb (e.g., 行かない + ないでもない → 行かないでもない) or an adjective (e.g., できない + ないでもない → できないでもない). While it creates a double negative, the overall meaning leans towards a cautious positive. For instance, 「分からないでもない」 doesn't mean 'I don't understand' but rather 'I kind of understand' or 'it's not that I don't understand'.\n\n「なくもない」 is an interchangeable variation, though it is less frequently used. Both structures are fundamentally similar in their nuanced expression of possibility or reluctant agreement.",

The construction 「間違えないでもない」 literally means 'it's not not making mistakes', signifying that the possibility of error is not entirely absent, but usually contradicted by the subject's actions. This double negative functions as a hesitant acknowledgment of a potential negative."
