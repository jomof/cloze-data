    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないでもない」 is formed by negating a negative. It literally means \"not not be.\" This double negative construction creates a nuance of hesitant affirmation or possibility.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ないでもない」, literally meaning \"not not be,\" expresses a hesitant affirmation, possibility, or mild agreement. It indicates that something is \"kind of,\" \"might be,\" or \"somewhat\" true. Think of it as a way of saying you don't completely disagree, or that you see a possibility, however slight. This grammar point is used in situations where the speaker can neither fully confirm nor deny something, or when they want to express a nuanced agreement. \n\n「なくもない」 is an interchangeable variation, though less common.",
