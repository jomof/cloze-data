    "etymology": "The term 「ずくめ」 originates from the suffix-like use of 「尽(つ)く」, meaning \"completely\" or \"using solely.\" The addition of 「め」 transformed it, eventually leading to the preferred hiragana spelling with 「ず」 replacing 「づ」.",
    "writeup": "「ずくめ」 is used to express that something is entirely composed of or characterized by a specific noun. It means \"completely (A),\" \"all in (A),\" or \"nothing but (A).\" It's generally attached directly to nouns, signifying that (A) is so prevalent that nothing else is noticed.\n\nWhen 「ずくめ」 directly modifies a noun, 「の」 is inserted between them (e.g., 「黒ずくめの男」). Although 「づくめ」 might appear in older texts, 「ずくめ」 is now the standard spelling. It can be used in both positive and negative contexts, but it's most common in set expressions. It's best used with familiar combinations.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   「尽(つ)くし」 is an older structure denoting things that are separate but grouped together, usually translated as \"all sorts of (A)\" or \"all kinds of (A).\" It's the conjunctive form of the う-Verb 「尽(つ)くす」, meaning \"to be exhaustive,\" with a voiced pronunciation of 「つ」.",
