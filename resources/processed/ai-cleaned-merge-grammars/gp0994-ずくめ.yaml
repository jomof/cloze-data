    "etymology": "The term 「ずくめ」 originates from the verb 「尽(つ)くす」 (tsukusu), meaning \"to exhaust\" or \"to use up completely.\" The 「め」 (me) is an added suffix, thought to emphasize the completeness. Over time, 「づくめ」 became 「ずくめ」, reflecting a shift in pronunciation and preferred writing.",
    "writeup": "The term 「ずくめ」 (zukume) is used to express that something is entirely or exclusively made up of something else. It stems from the verb 「尽(つ)くす」 (tsukusu), meaning \"to exhaust\" or \"use completely.\" The 「め」 (me) is added as a suffix, thought to emphasize the completeness. It attaches directly to nouns, indicating that the specified element is so prevalent that nothing else is apparent. There are two main formations for 「ずくめ」: 1. **[Noun] + ずくめ**: This form functions adverbially, indicating that the preceding noun completely dominates the situation or period. For example, 「仕事ずくめ」 (shigoto zukume) means \"nothing but work.\" 2. **[Noun] + ずくめ + の + Noun**: In this form, 「ずくめ」 acts as an adjectival phrase modifying the following noun. For example, 「黒ずくめの服」 (kuro zukume no fuku) means \"an outfit that is entirely black.\" While 「づくめ」 (dzukume) might appear in older texts, 「ずくめ」 (zukume) is the standard form now. 「ずくめ」 can be used in both positive and negative situations, and its usage is flexible across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal declarations. It is often seen in fixed expressions. Be mindful of its usage and aim to apply it in scenarios you've encountered before. **Important Considerations:** The nuance of 「ずくめ」 is that the noun is **so dominant** that it describes the entirety or exclusive nature of the situation or item. It is not merely 'a lot of' but 'nothing but' or 'completely composed of'. It often implies an overwhelming or all-encompassing characteristic, rather than just a large quantity or limitation.",

            "nuance": "While 「ずくめ」 emphasizes a comprehensive or overwhelming presence of something, 「ばかり」 often implies a sense of limitation or exclusivity. For example, 「仕事ばかり」 (shigoto bakari) means \"nothing but work\" implying a complaint, while 「仕事ずくめ」 (shigoto zukume) suggests that work is the defining characteristic of that time. 「ばかり」 can also imply 'just finished doing something'."

For example, 「泥(どろ)だらけ」 (doro darake) means \"covered in mud.\" 「ずくめ」 (zukume) doesn't inherently carry this negative connotation, and while it can be used in negative contexts, it focuses on completeness rather than messiness or undesirability."

            "nuance": "Unlike 「ずくめ」 which indicates something is completely or exclusively of one type, 「ずくし」 implies a thorough list or an exhaustive array of *different* things. It comes from 「尽くす」 (tsukusu) meaning 'to exhaust' or 'to do to the utmost.' For example, 「ごちそうずくし」 (gochisou zukushi) would mean a full course of various delicacies, whereas 「ごちそうずくめ」 (gochisou zukume) means 'nothing but delicacies', implying a singular focus on luxury food."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference to remember is that 「ずくめ」 (zukume) indicates something is made up entirely or exclusively of one thing. In contrast, 「ばかり」 (bakari) implies a limitation or exclusivity, often with a subtle nuance of 'only' or 'nothing but (to the exclusion of others)'. 「だらけ」 (darake) refers to being covered in or full of undesirable things, usually with a negative connotation. Lastly, 「ずくし」 (zukushi) means 'all sorts of' or 'an exhaustive list of various items', emphasizing variety rather than singular dominance.",
