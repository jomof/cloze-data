        "[Noun] + ずくめ": "Indicates something is made up entirely or exclusively of that noun.",

    "meaning": "Completely, entirely, all in, nothing but, a real streak of, without exception.",
    "meaning_warning": "づくめ is an older, pre-reform variant. ずくめ should be used instead. There is another suffix that uses づくし, meaning “all sorts/kinds of (A)”.",

        "part-of-speech": "suffix",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "General use",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes the overwhelming and exclusive nature of a characteristic or state.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as an adverbial phrase or an adjectival phrase when followed by の."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「ずくめ」 originates from the verb 「尽(つ)くす」 (tsukusu), meaning \"to exhaust\" or \"to use up completely.\" The 「め」 (me) is an added suffix, thought to emphasize the completeness. Over time, 「づくめ」 became 「ずくめ」, reflecting a shift in pronunciation and preferred writing.",
    "writeup": "The term 「ずくめ」 (zukume) is used to express that something is entirely or exclusively made up of something else. It stems from the verb 「尽(つ)くす」 (tsukusu), meaning \"to exhaust\" or \"use completely.\" The 「め」 (me) is added as a suffix, thought to emphasize the completeness. It attaches directly to nouns, indicating that the specified element is so prevalent that nothing else is apparent.\n\nThere are two main formations for 「ずくめ」:\n\n1.  **[Noun] + ずくめ**: This form functions adverbially, indicating that the preceding noun completely dominates the situation or period. For example, 「仕事ずくめ」 (shigoto zukume) means \"nothing but work.\"\n2.  **[Noun] + ずくめ + の + Noun**: In this form, 「ずくめ」 acts as an adjectival phrase modifying the following noun. For example, 「黒ずくめの服」 (kuro zukume no fuku) means \"an outfit that is entirely black.\"\n\nWhile 「づくめ」 (dzukume) might appear in older texts, 「ずくめ」 (zukume) is the standard form now. 「ずくめ」 can be used in both positive and negative situations, but it is often seen in fixed expressions. Be mindful of its usage and aim to apply it in scenarios you've encountered before.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The nuance of 「ずくめ」 is that the noun is **so dominant** that it describes the entirety or exclusive nature of the situation or item. It is not merely 'a lot of' but 'nothing but' or 'completely composed of'.\n*   It often implies an overwhelming or all-encompassing characteristic, rather than just a large quantity or limitation.",

            "etymology": "課題 (kadai) means 'challenge' or 'task'. 乗り越えよう (norikoeyou) is the volitional form of 'to overcome'. This phrase implies a collective effort to face significant obstacles, highlighting the comprehensive nature of the challenges described by ずくめ."

It comes from 「尽くす」 (tsukusu) meaning 'to exhaust' or 'to do to the utmost.' For example, 「ごちそうずくし」 (gochisou zukushi) would mean a full course of various delicacies, whereas 「ごちそうずくめ」 (gochisou zukume) means 'nothing but delicacies', implying a singular focus on luxury food."
