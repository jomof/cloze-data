    "etymology": "The term 「ずくめ」 originates from the verb 「尽(つ)くす」 (tsukusu), meaning \"to exhaust\" or \"to use up completely.\" The 「め」 (me) is an added suffix, thought to emphasize the completeness. Over time, 「づくめ」 became 「ずくめ」, reflecting a shift in pronunciation and preferred writing.",
    "writeup": "The term 「ずくめ」 (zukume) is used to express that something is entirely or exclusively made up of something else. It stems from the verb 「尽(つ)くす」 (tsukusu), meaning \"to exhaust\" or \"use completely.\" The particle 「め」 (me) is added as a suffix, thought to emphasize the completeness. It attaches directly to nouns, indicating that the specified element is so prevalent that nothing else is apparent. When 「ずくめ」 modifies a following noun, it typically takes the form 「ずくめのNoun」. For instance, 「黒ずくめのスーツ」 (kuro zukume no suutsu) means \"a suit that is completely black.\"\n\nWhile 「づくめ」 (dzukume) might appear in older texts, 「ずくめ」 (zukume) is the standard form now. 「ずくめ」 (zukume) can be used in both positive and negative situations, but it is often seen in fixed expressions. Be mindful of its usage and aim to apply it in scenarios you've encountered before.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   The nuance of 「ずくめ」 is that the noun is **so dominant** that it describes the entirety or exclusive nature of the situation or item. It is not merely 'a lot of' but 'nothing but' or 'completely composed of'.",
