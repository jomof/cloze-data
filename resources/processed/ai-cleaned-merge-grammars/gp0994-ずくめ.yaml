    "etymology": "The term 「ずくめ」 originates from the verb 「尽(つ)くす」 (tsukusu), meaning \"to exhaust\" or \"to use up completely.\" The 「め」 (me) is an added suffix, thought to emphasize the completeness. Over time, 「づくめ」 became 「ずくめ」, reflecting a shift in pronunciation and preferred writing.",
    "writeup": "The term 「ずくめ」 (zukume) is used to express that something is entirely or exclusively made up of something else. It stems from the verb 「尽(つ)くす」 (tsukusu), meaning \"to exhaust\" or \"use completely.\" The particle 「め」 (me) is added as a suffix, thought to emphasize the completeness. It attaches directly to nouns, indicating that the specified element is so prevalent that nothing else is apparent.\n\nWhile 「づくめ」 (dzukume) might appear in older texts, 「ずくめ」 (zukume) is the standard form now. 「ずくめ」 (zukume) can be used in both positive and negative situations, but it is often seen in fixed expressions. Be mindful of its usage and aim to apply it in scenarios you've encountered before.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   「ずくし」 (zukushi) is a similar-sounding term but has a different meaning. It is a conjunctive form of the verb 「尽(つ)くす」 (tsukusu), and is used to express \"all sorts of\" or \"all kinds of.\" So, be careful not to confuse it with 「ずくめ」 (zukume).\n",
