    "etymology": "それで is derived from the pronoun それ (that) and the particle で, which indicates means or cause. Therefore, literally, it means \"with that\" or \"by that means,\" referring back to the previous clause or sentence.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「それで」 functions as a conjunction connecting two clauses or sentences. It is essentially a combination of the pronoun 「それ」, which refers to the entirety of the preceding statement or situation, and the particle 「で」, which indicates the means or cause. This construction conveys that the preceding information is the reason, cause, or basis for the following statement. As such, it can be translated as \"because of that,\" \"therefore,\" \"so,\" or \"with that.\"\n\n「それで」 is often used to show a direct consequence or logical result of a previous action or situation. It is commonly found at the beginning of a second sentence to clearly link it to the first. While it expresses causality, it is generally less formal than expressions like 「そのため」 or 「それゆえ」.\n\nIn conversational contexts, 「それで？」 can be used interrogatively to prompt the speaker for the next part of a story, akin to \"And then?\" or \"So what happened?\" This usage is very common and natural in Japanese conversation.",

They don't express a direct cause-and-effect relationship in the same way それで does, but rather a logical progression or implication. それでは is formal, while それじゃ is its casual contraction."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While それで and そのため(に) both convey causality, そのため(に) often indicates a more deliberate purpose or a more formal causal link. だから is a stronger, more direct way to express 'that's why,' which can sometimes sound abrupt or assertive. When connecting a reason to a result within a single sentence, 〜ので is a common choice, offering a softer tone. Lastly, それでは and それじゃ function primarily as transitional phrases, signaling a shift or a next step, rather than directly stating a cause or reason. Choosing between them depends on the nuance of causality, formality, and whether you are linking sentences or transitioning conversationally.",
