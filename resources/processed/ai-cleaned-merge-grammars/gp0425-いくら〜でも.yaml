    "etymology": "「いくら」 comes from the kanji 幾ら, meaning \"how much\". It emphasizes quantity or degree.",
    "writeup": "「いくら〜でも」 is similar to 「どんなに〜ても」, generally translating to \"no matter how (A), (B)\". 「いくら」 is a noun signifying \"how much.\" When combined with 「ても」 (for verbs and い-adjectives) or 「でも」 (for nouns and な-adjectives), it literally means \"however much (A), (B)\". The (B) part often negates something, giving the phrase its \"no matter how much\" nuance.\n\nWhile often used with negative sentences containing 「ない」 or 「ありません」, 「いくら〜でも」 can appear in positive sentences, indicating something surprising or unexpected due to its extent or amount.\n\nImportant note: 「いくら」 emphasizes the \"amount\" of something, while 「どんなに」 emphasizes the \"type\" or \"style\". Use 「いくら」 when highlighting volume and 「どんなに」 when discussing state. Though there's a slight difference, they're often interchangeable.",
