    "etymology": "「いくら」 originates from the kanji 「幾ら」, meaning \"how much\". The addition of 「でも」 (even, but, also) creates the nuance of \"even if it is any amount\", hence \"no matter how much.\"",
    "writeup": "Similar to 「どんなに〜ても」, 「いくら〜でも」 translates to \"no matter how (A), (B)\". However, unlike 「どんな」 (an abbreviation of 「どのような」), 「いくら」 is a noun meaning \"how much\". Paired with 「ても」 (for verbs and い-adjectives) or 「でも」 (for nouns and な-adjectives), it literally means \"however much (A), (B)\".\n\nWith 「いくら〜でも」, the (B) part of the phrase often negates something, giving the phrase its \"no matter how much\" nuance. While often used in sentences with 「ない」 or 「ありません」, 「いくら〜でも」 can also appear in positive sentences, where the (B) phrase is surprising or unexpected due to its extent or amount.\n\n「いくら」 emphasizes the \"amount\" of something, while 「どんなに」 emphasizes the \"type\" or \"style\". 「いくら」 is better when highlighting volume, while 「どんなに」 sounds more natural when discussing state. Despite this, 「いくら」 and 「どんなに」 are often interchangeable.",

            "etymology": "「あの」 means 'that', referring to a person, and 「言う」 means 'to say'. Together, 「言っても」 translates to 'even if you say'."
