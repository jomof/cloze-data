        "source": "bunpro"
    },
    "etymology": "「いくら」 originates from the kanji 幾ら, literally meaning 'how much'. Its inclusion in this grammatical pattern retains that sense of quantifying the extent or degree of something. The pattern then combines this interrogative sense of quantity with a concessive marker (ても/でも) to convey the idea of 'no matter what quantity/extent'.",
    "writeup": "「いくら〜でも」 functions similarly to 「どんなに〜ても」, both generally translating to \"no matter how (A), (B)\". However, a key distinction lies in the nuance of the initial word. 「いくら」, stemming from 幾ら, means \"how much,\" placing emphasis on **quantity, amount, or extent**. In contrast, 「どんなに」, derived from どのような, focuses on \"what kind\" or \"what sort,\" emphasizing **type, manner, or quality**.\n\nWhen using 「いくら〜でも」, 「いくら」 combines with the te-form of verbs and い-adjectives followed by 「ても」, or with nouns and な-adjectives followed by 「でも」. The literal translation is \"however much (A), (B)\". The (B) part of the phrase typically highlights a result that is unexpected or remains unchanged despite the condition in (A), often leading to a negative outcome or a statement of surprising resilience.\n\nWhile this pattern is frequently found in sentences expressing negation (e.g., using 「ない」 or 「ありません」), it can also appear in positive sentences. In such cases, the (B) phrase still conveys something surprising or unexpected given the extent or amount described in (A). For example, it might indicate that a vast quantity exists, or that even a highly capable person has limitations.\n\n**Key Difference with どんなに〜ても:**\nUse 「いくら〜でも」 when you want to highlight the *volume* or *amount* of something (e.g., effort, money, time, degree of a quality). Use 「どんなに〜ても」 when the emphasis is on the *type*, *manner*, or *quality* (e.g., how beautiful, how difficult in nature). Although there is this subtle difference, in many situations, both expressions can be used interchangeably, especially when the context allows for both interpretations.",
