    "etymology": "まで is thought to originate from the verb 待つ (matsu, \"to wait\"), evolving over time to indicate a waiting point or limit. It conceptually marks the boundary or endpoint of an action or state.",
    "writeup": "まで is a particle indicating 'as far as (A)' or 'until the point of (A)'. With verbs, it typically translates to 'until (A) happens'. Crucially, **まで cannot be used directly with verbs in the past tense.** The past tense meaning is derived from the context or later verbs in the sentence.\n\nFor instance, in 「授業が始まるまで、先生が来なかった」, the teacher's arrival 「来なかった」 is in the past, indicating it occurred after the class started 「授業が始まる」. Pay close attention to how tense is expressed in the overall sentence to convey the intended meaning.",
