    "etymology": "「どれ」 is part of the 「こそあど言葉」 family, related to demonstrative pronouns. It shares its root with 「これ」 (this), 「それ」 (that), and 「あれ」 (that over there). The 'ど' indicates an inquiry about something unknown.",
    "writeup": "「どれ」 belongs to the same family of words as 「これ」, 「それ」, and 「あれ」. These are collectively known as 「こそあど言葉」 (kosoado kotoba) in Japanese, referring to a category of demonstrative words. Unlike 「これ」, 「それ」, and 「あれ」, which are used to point to a specific item or location, words starting with 「ど」 are interrogative, designed for inquiring about something unknown.\n\nSpecifically, 「どれ」 translates to \"which\" in English and is used when asking about a selection from a group of **three or more** items. This numerical distinction is crucial: if there are only two choices, the words 「どちら」 or its more casual equivalent 「どっち」 are typically used instead. This usage pattern has become standard over time in Japanese.\n\nWhile 「どれ」 can stand alone as a pronoun, it is often used with particles. For instance, the particle 「が」 often accompanies 「どれ」 when it functions as the subject in a question, such as 「どれが一番好きですか？」 (Which one do you like the most?). When 「どれ」 is combined with particles like 「も」 or 「でも」, it takes on the meaning of \"any\" or \"all\" from a given group, rather than a specific selection.",
