    "etymology": "「どれ」 is part of the 「こそあど言葉」 family, related to demonstrative pronouns. It shares its root with 「これ」 (this), 「それ」 (that), and 「あれ」 (that over there). The 'ど' indicates an inquiry about something unknown.",
    "writeup": "「どれ」 belongs to the same family of words as 「これ」, 「それ」, and 「あれ」. These are known as 「こそあど言葉」 in Japanese, a category of demonstrative words. Unlike 「これ」, 「それ」, and 「あれ」, which point to a specific item, words starting with 「ど」 are interrogative, used to inquire about something unknown. 「どれ」 translates to \"which\" and is specifically used when asking about a selection from a group of **three or more** items. When there are only two choices, one typically uses 「どちら」 or its more casual form 「どっち」 instead.\n\nWhile 「どれ」 can stand alone, it is often followed by particles. For instance, 「が」 is frequently used with 「どれ」, especially in questions where 「どれ」 functions as the subject. However, if 「どれ」 is followed by a noun (acting as a noun-phrase), then 「は」 might be used to mark it as the topic. For example, in a statement like 「リンゴはどれも美味しい」 (All apples are delicious), 「どれ」 here functions differently to express a general affirmative.\n\nThis distinction between 「どれ」 for three or more options and 「どちら」/「どっち」 for two options is a common usage pattern in modern Japanese, though it wasn't always strictly applied in the language's history.",
