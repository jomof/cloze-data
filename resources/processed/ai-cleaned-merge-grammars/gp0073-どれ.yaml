    "etymology": "「どれ」 is part of the 「こそあど言葉」 family, related to demonstrative pronouns. It shares its root with 「これ」 (this), 「それ」 (that), and 「あれ」 (that over there). The 'ど' indicates an inquiry about something unknown.",
    "writeup": "「どれ」 belongs to the same family of words as 「これ」, 「それ」, and 「あれ」. These are known as 「こそあど言葉」 in Japanese. Unlike the others which point to a specific item, words starting with 「ど」 are used to inquire about something unknown. 「どれ」 translates to \"which\" and is used when asking about a group of three or more items. While 「が」 is often used with 「どれ」, especially in questions, 「は」 is used when 「どれ」 follows a noun. When selecting between only two choices, use 「どちら」+「の」 or 「どっち」+「の」 instead of 「どれ」.",
