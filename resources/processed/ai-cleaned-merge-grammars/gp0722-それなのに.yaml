    "etymology": "「それなのに」 is a conjunction comprised of 「それ」(a demonstrative pronoun referring to something previously mentioned), 「な」(a connective particle), and 「のに」(a conjunction indicating contradiction or unexpectedness). Therefore, it literally means \"despite that thing\" or \"even though that is the case.\"",
    "writeup": "「それなのに」 functions as a conjunction, similar to \"and yet\" or \"despite this\" in English. It connects two sentences where the second sentence (B) presents a situation that is contradictory or unexpected in light of the first sentence (A). It is typically used at the beginning of a sentence to introduce the unexpected or contrasting information. Think of it as highlighting a deviation from what one would reasonably expect based on the preceding context. It implies a sense of surprise or frustration that the expected outcome did not occur.",
