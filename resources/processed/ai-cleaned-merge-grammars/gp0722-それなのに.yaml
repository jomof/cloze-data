    "etymology": "「それなのに」 is a conjunction comprised of 「それ」(a demonstrative pronoun referring to something previously mentioned), 「な」(a connective particle), and 「のに」(a conjunction indicating contradiction or unexpectedness). Therefore, it literally means \"despite that thing\" or \"even though that is the case.\"",
    "writeup": "「それなのに」 functions as a conjunction, similar to \"and yet\" or \"despite this\" in English. It connects two statements where the second statement (B) presents a situation that is contradictory or unexpected in light of the first statement (A). It is typically used at the beginning of a sentence to introduce the unexpected or contrasting information. Think of it as highlighting a deviation from what one would reasonably expect based on the preceding context. It implies a sense of surprise or frustration that the expected outcome did not occur.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies a conversation where the speaker is relaying information, making the use of 「それなのに」, which functions as a conjunction connecting two distinct statements, more natural than the particle 「のに」, which integrates the contradiction into a single complex sentence."
