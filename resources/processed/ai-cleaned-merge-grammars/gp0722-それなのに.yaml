        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "Connects two statements where the second statement is contradictory or unexpected in light of the first.",
        "nuance": "Implies a sense of surprise or frustration when an expected outcome does not occur. It often highlights a deviation from what one would reasonably expect based on the preceding context.",

    "etymology": "「それなのに」 is a conjunction formed from 「それ」(a demonstrative pronoun referring to something previously mentioned), 「な」(a connective particle, similar to の-da or の-desu as a nominalizer), and 「のに」(a conjunction indicating contradiction or unexpectedness). Thus, it literally means \"despite that (thing)\" or \"even though that is the case.\" The combination emphasizes the unexpected nature of the following statement in relation to the preceding one.",
    "writeup": "「それなのに」 functions as a conjunction, akin to \"and yet\" or \"despite this\" in English. It connects two statements (Sentence A and Sentence B), where Sentence B presents a situation that is contradictory or unexpected when considering Sentence A. It is typically used at the beginning of a new sentence to introduce the unexpected or contrasting information, clearly referring back to the previous statement. This highlights a deviation from what one would reasonably expect based on the preceding context and often implies a sense of surprise or frustration that the expected outcome did not occur.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「もっとも」 is generally more formal and often introduces an exception or condition to a statement, sometimes with a nuance of 'it's true that... but'. In contrast, 「それなのに」 expresses a direct contradiction or an unexpected result, often with a sense of frustration or surprise."

            "meaning": "Nevertheless, Even so",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「それにしても」 is used to acknowledge a previous point while introducing a surprising or unexpected element, often with a sense of wonder or mild disbelief, or to express that something is still too much/little regardless of prior context. 「それなのに」, however, emphasizes the contradictory nature of the second statement given the first, focusing on the gap between expectation and reality."

            "term": "しかしながら",
            "meaning": "However, Nevertheless, But",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「しかしながら」 is a more formal equivalent of 「しかし」, predominantly used in writing or formal speech to introduce a contrast. 「それなのに」 is generally less formal and more commonly used in everyday conversation to highlight an unexpected result or situation, often implying a personal reaction of surprise or frustration."

            "nuance": "When used as a particle (e.g., Verb-plain/Noun+なの/Adj+なの +のに), 「のに」 indicates a sense of disappointment or regret about something not going as expected within a single complex sentence. Unlike 「それなのに」, which connects two separate independent statements, 「のに」 (as a particle) emphasizes the unexpected contrast as a cause for regret or surprise integrated into the clause."

            "nuance": "「それでも」 implies that despite a certain condition or situation, something else is still true, often showing resilience, determination, or persistence. 「それなのに」 focuses more directly on the unexpected or illogical nature of the second situation given the first, often with a feeling of surprise or frustration."
        },

            "term": "ながらも",
            "meaning": "But, Even while, Even though, Despite, Although",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ながらも」 connects two clauses where the second contrasts with the first, often implying a concession or a simultaneous action/state (e.g., 'even while doing X, Y occurs'). It's more about acknowledging a condition while something else happens. 「それなのに」 is used between two distinct sentences, highlighting a more pronounced and often surprising contradiction."

            "nuance": "「くせに」 carries a negative connotation, often implying resentment, criticism, or blame towards someone's actions or characteristics (e.g., 'even though X, you still do Y'). 「それなのに」 is more neutral and simply highlights the unexpected nature of the situation without necessarily conveying judgment or blame."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "「それなのに」 strongly emphasizes an unexpected outcome that contradicts a prior statement, often conveying surprise or frustration. While particles like 「のに」 can express similar contradictions within a single clause, 「それなのに」 acts as a conjunction connecting two separate ideas, giving more weight to the contrast. Other similar expressions like 「もっとも」 and 「しかしながら」 are more formal and tend to introduce conditions or general contrasts, lacking the specific emotional nuance of unexpectedness often present with 「それなのに」. 「それでも」 suggests persistence despite conditions, and 「くせに」 carries a judgmental tone, setting them apart from the more neutral yet surprised tone of 「それなのに」.",
