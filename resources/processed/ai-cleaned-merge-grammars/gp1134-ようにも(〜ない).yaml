    "etymology": "「よう」 is the volitional form of a verb, indicating intention or desire. 「にも」 adds the nuance of \"even though\" or \"despite.\" 「ない」 negates the possibility of the action. Together, they create the meaning of \"even though I want to, I cannot.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ようにも(〜ない)」 expresses that even if someone wants to do something, they are unable to because of external circumstances or internal limitations. It combines a verb in the volitional form (expressing intent) with 「にも」 (even though) and a negative ending 「ない」 (cannot). The nuance is one of frustration or helplessness, where the desire to act is present but unrealizable.\n\nIt's similar to saying \"I wish I could, but I can't\" or \"Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.\"\n\nIt is closely related to the pattern, 「たくても～ない」, and 「～たいけど、～ない」.",
