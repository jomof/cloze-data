    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ようにも(〜ない)」 expresses that even if someone wants to do something, they are unable to because of external circumstances or internal limitations. It combines a verb in the volitional form (expressing intent) with 「にも」 (even though) and a negative ending 「ない」 (cannot). The nuance is one of frustration or helplessness, where the desire to act is present but unrealizable. It's similar to saying \"I wish I could, but I can't\" or \"Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.\" This expression highlights a gap between one's will or intention and the reality of their ability to act. It's often used when expressing a personal dilemma or an external barrier. While the general tone can lean formal, particularly with polite conjugations like 「〜ません」, its core structure is versatile enough to appear in casual conversations as well, especially when paired with plain forms of negation.",

Finally, 「〜ても」 states a conditional 'even if', but lacks the specific nuance of a deeply felt personal desire that is thwarted, which is central to 「ようにも〜ない」. The key distinction for 「ようにも〜ない」 is the presence of an insurmountable barrier that prevents the desired action, making the internal desire irrelevant in the face of external reality.",
