    "etymology": "The grammar point combines 「ほど」 (hodo), meaning 'degree, extent,' with 「ない」 (nai), the negative form of 「ある」 (aru), 'to be.' Therefore, it literally means 'not to the degree of.'",
    "writeup": "The expression 「ほど〜ない」 uses the noun 「ほど」 (hodo), meaning \"extent.\" The (A) part of the sentence highlights an extent, while the (B) part uses 「ない」 to negate that extent, indicating it hasn't been reached. It translates to \"it isn't like (A)\" or \"it's not to the point of (A).\" Literally, it means, \"if (A) is the extent, then (B) is not true.\" 「ほど」 usually follows a verb or noun, while 「ない」 typically follows a verb, い-adjective, or な-adjective, describing something about 「ほど」.\n\nWhile primarily used to express that an extent hasn't been reached, 「ほど〜ない」 frequently compares two things, stating that \"the example/limit of (A) is something that cannot be reached/repeated by (B).\" This is similar to \"(B) is not as ~ as (A)\" in English.",
