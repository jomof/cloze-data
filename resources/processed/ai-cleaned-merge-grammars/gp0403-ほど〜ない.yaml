    "etymology": "The grammar point combines 「程 (ほど)」, meaning 'extent' or 'degree,' with 「ない」, the negative form of 「ある」 (to be). It literally conveys the idea that something does not reach a certain extent or degree.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ほど〜ない」 uses the noun 「程 (ほど)」 to express that something is not to the extent of something else. It can be translated as \"is not as...as,\" \"isn't like...\" or \"not to the extent of...\" 「ほど」 highlights an extent, while 「ない」 negates that extent, stating that it has not been reached. This structure is used for making comparisons, indicating that one thing does not reach the level of another. For example, 「東京ほど人口が多い都会はないと思う」 means \"I don't think there is another city with a population as large as Tokyo's.\"",
