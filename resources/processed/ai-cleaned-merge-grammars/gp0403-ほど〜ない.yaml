    "etymology": "The grammar point combines 「程 (ほど)」, meaning 'extent' or 'degree,' with 「ない」, the negative form of 「ある」 (to be). It literally conveys the idea that something does not reach a certain extent or degree.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ほど〜ない」 is a crucial comparative structure used to express that something **does not reach the extent or degree of something else**. It literally conveys the idea that 'if X is the extent, then Y does not achieve that extent'. This translates to English phrases like \"is not as... as,\" \"isn't... like...,\" or \"not to the extent of...\". The core function of 「ほど〜ない」 is to draw a negative comparison, stating that the subject of the sentence does not possess a quality or characteristic to the same degree as the referent.\n\n**Formation:**\n*   It typically follows a noun or a verb (in plain form), setting the standard or reference point for the comparison.\n*   The 「ない」 component, which is the negative form of an i-adjective, indicates the lack of that quality or degree in the subject being described. While 「ない」 is the base form, it can be conjugated to express different tenses or modalities, such as past tense (〜なかった) or polite forms (〜くありません), without changing the fundamental comparative nature of the expression.\n\n**Usage Context:**\n「ほど〜ない」 is widely used for both concrete and abstract comparisons. For instance, it can compare physical attributes (e.g., \"not as tall as\"), abstract concepts (e.g., \"not as difficult as\"), or even expectations (e.g., \"not as bad as I thought\"). It's a versatile phrase that allows speakers to set a benchmark and then state that something falls short of it.",
