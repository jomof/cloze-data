    "etymology": "The grammar point combines 「程 (ほど)」, meaning 'extent' or 'degree,' with 「ない」, the negative form of 「ある」 (to be). It literally conveys the idea that something does not reach a certain extent or degree. This core concept of 'extent' or 'limit' is fundamental to understanding its various uses, whether referring to a physical limit or a qualitative one.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ほど〜ない」 is a crucial comparative structure used to express that something **does not reach the extent or degree of something else**. It literally conveys the idea that 'if X is the extent, then Y does not achieve that extent'. This translates to English phrases like \"is not as... as,\" \"isn't... like...,\" or \"not to the extent of...\". The core function of 「ほど〜ない」 is to draw a negative comparison, stating that the subject of the sentence does not possess a quality or characteristic to the same degree as the referent.\n\n**Formation:**\n*   It typically follows a noun, a verb (in plain form), or an adjective (in plain form), setting the standard or reference point for the comparison.\n*   The predicate following 「ほど」 will be in a negative form (e.g., using 「ない」, 「ではありません」, etc.), indicating the lack of that quality or degree in the subject being described. While 「ない」 is the base form, it can be conjugated to express different tenses or modalities, such as past tense (〜なかった) or polite forms (〜くありません), without changing the fundamental comparative nature of the expression.\n\n**Usage Context:**\n「ほど〜ない」 is widely used for both concrete and abstract comparisons. For instance, it can compare physical attributes (e.g., \"not as tall as\"), abstract concepts (e.g., \"not as difficult as\"), or even expectations (e.g., \"not as bad as I thought\"). It's a versatile phrase that allows speakers to set a benchmark and then state that something falls short of it.",

For example, 「思った ほど 難しく ない」 means 'it's not as difficult as I thought it would be,' emphasizing the gap between expectation and reality. 「ほど」 by itself denotes extent or degree (e.g., 'the more, the more'), and 「まで」 indicates a limit or inclusion (e.g., 'even X'), whereas 「ほど〜ない」 specifically uses the concept of 'extent' for a negative comparison.",
