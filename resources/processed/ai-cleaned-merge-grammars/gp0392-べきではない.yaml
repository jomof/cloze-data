    "writeup": "「べきではない」 (or its more casual forms 「べきじゃない」 and 「べきじゃありません」) is used to express a strong recommendation or prohibition. It conveys that an action **should not be done** because it is improper, incorrect, or would lead to negative consequences.\n\nThis expression is much stronger than simply saying 「～ないほうがいい」 (it would be better not to), carrying a nuance of moral, social, or logical imperative. It implies that performing the action would be a mistake or fundamentally wrong.\n\nIt attaches to the dictionary (plain non-past) form of verbs. For the verb 「する」 (to do), there are two acceptable forms:\n*   **するべきではない** (more common)\n*   **すべきではない** (also acceptable, though slightly less common)\n\nAs with other phrases containing 「では」, the particle 「は」 may be omitted, resulting in 「べきではない」 becoming 「べきでない」. However, including 「は」 strengthens the negation, making the overall phrase more emphatic. Similarly, the casual forms 「べきじゃない」 and 「べきじゃありません」 also omit 「は」.\n\nThis grammar point can also be used in the past tense to express regret over something that should not have been done: 「すべきではなかった」 or 「すべきではありませんでした」.",
