jlpt: N3
etymology: The term 「割(わり)」 means "proportion" or "ratio." The 「に」 particle indicates direction or purpose.
  Therefore, 「割に」 literally translates to "in proportion to," but is used to express that something is
  disproportionate or unexpected relative to something else. It implies a comparison of something to its
  own inherent standard or expectation, revealing an surprising difference.
writeup: 「割に」 is an adverbial phrase used to express a sense of disproportion or unexpectedness. It conveys
  that something is **not** as one would expect, considering a particular factor or condition. This phrase
  highlights a contrast or contradiction, comparing something to expectations within its category rather
  than explicitly comparing it to another distinct item. It can appear at the beginning of a sentence
  or after the word/phrase it modifies. When connecting to a noun, use 「の」. When connecting to a な-adjective,
  use 「な」. For い-adjectives and verbs, use their plain forms directly before 「割に」.

  - term: にしては
    meaning: (Even) considering, (Even) for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「割に」, 「にしては」 often implies a greater level of surprise and can be used to set a standard
      or expectation for comparison.
    grammar_point: にしては (considering)
  - term: に比べて
    meaning: Compared to, When compared to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「割に」, 「に比べて」 explicitly compares two separate things or categories, whereas 「割に」 compares
      one thing to an expectation about itself.
    grammar_point: に比べて (compared to)
  - term: さえ
    meaning: Even
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「割に」, 「さえ」 emphasizes an extreme or surprising inclusion, often indicating a minimum
      condition or boundary (e.g., 'even X is included'). It highlights unexpected scope rather than a
      disproportional relationship within an entity's characteristics.
    grammar_point: さえ (even・if only)
  - term: ものの
    meaning: Although, But, Even Though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ものの」 introduces a general concession or contrasting fact (e.g., 'although X, Y'), 「割に」
      specifically highlights an unexpected or disproportionate characteristic relative to what one would
      anticipate from a given item or situation.
    grammar_point: ものの (although・but)
  - term: むしろ
    meaning: Rather, Instead, Over
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「割に」, 「むしろ」 is used to express a preference or to correct a misunderstanding by presenting
      an alternative. It does not convey a sense of disproportion or unexpectedness.
    grammar_point: むしろ (rather・instead)
  - term: 割と
    meaning: Comparatively, rather, unexpectedly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「割と」 is primarily an adverb emphasizing degree, often used for unexpected quality (e.g., "surprisingly
      good"), while 「割に」 highlights a disproportionate relationship or contrast to an expected norm. 「割と」
      can be used alone, while 「割に」 must follow a noun/adjective/verb.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:割と (comparatively・rather・unexpectedly)
  - term: だけあって
    meaning: As expected; being the case; because.
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「だけあって」 expresses that an outcome is natural or justified given a certain quality or condition,
      implying that something is **as expected** for its type, directly contrasting with 「割に」's emphasis
      on unexpectedness or disproportion.
    grammar_point: 〜だけあって・〜だけに・〜だけのことはある (as expected・precisely because)
  - term: くせに
    meaning: Even though; despite; and yet; but (implying criticism).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「割に」 and 「くせに」 can express something being 'despite' a condition, 「くせに」 carries
      a strong nuance of criticism or contempt towards the subject, implying they **should** be different
      given the stated condition. 「割に」 is neutral and simply points out an unexpected proportion.
    grammar_point: くせに (despite and yet)
  - term: にもかかわらず
    meaning: Despite; in spite of; regardless; nevertheless.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にもかかわらず」 indicates that something happened **despite** a certain condition, often implying
      a stronger and more direct opposition. 「割に」 focuses on a characteristic being disproportionate **relative
      to itself** or its type, rather than an action or event happening in spite of an obstacle.
    grammar_point: にかかわらず (regardless of)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing 「割に」 with similar expressions, remember that 「割に」 specifically
  highlights a disproportionate relationship or unexpectedness based on a known factor within the same
  category. For example, if something is expensive but low quality, 「割に」 is suitable because it contrasts
  the expected quality with the actual quality. In contrast, 「にしては」 emphasizes the degree of unexpectedness
  and can set a comparative standard, 「に比べて」 makes explicit comparisons between different entities, 「さえ」
  emphasizes an extreme case or scope, 「ものの」 introduces a simple contrasting idea, 「むしろ」 expresses a preference
  or correction, and 「割と」 is a general adverb for 'comparatively' or 'unexpectedly' without the strong
  sense of disproportionality tied to a preceding clause. Furthermore, 「だけあって」 is essentially the opposite
  of 「割に」, stating that something is **as expected** given its nature. Finally, 「くせに」 expresses 'despite'
  with a negative judgment or criticism, which is absent from the neutral nuance of 「割に」. 「にもかかわらず」 functions
  as a more general 'despite,' often for overcoming conditions, whereas 「割に」 is about internal inconsistencies
  or unexpected attributes.

  - english: This compact camera, for its size, is extremely high-performance.
    japanese:
      - この 小型 カメラ は 大き さ の {割 に}、非常 に 高 性能 です。

          - この 小型 カメラ は 大き さ に {し て は}、非常 に 高 性能 です。
        english: This compact camera, considering its size, is extremely high-performance.
        hint: While 「にしては」 can also express 'considering its size,' it often implies a stronger sense
          of surprise or a more direct comparison to a standard. 「割に」 focuses on the inherent disproportion
          between the size and performance.
    scene: A photographer showing off a new camera to a friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「大きさ の 割に」 highlights the unexpected capability relative to the camera's compact
      size. The speaker uses polite speech, 「高性能 です」, suitable for an informative conversation.
    etymology: The phrase leverages 「大きさ」 (ookisa) meaning size, and 「割に」 to imply an unexpected proportion
      relative to that size. This combination directly refers to the physical attribute of the camera
      and its performance, highlighting a surprising efficiency for its small form factor, connecting
      to the core meaning of 「割に」 as disproportionate to expectation.
  - english: For someone his age, he speaks surprisingly maturely.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 年 の {割 に}、大人 っぽい 話し 方 を する ね。
      - 彼 は 年齢 の {割 に は}、大人 っぽい 話し 方 を し ます ね。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 若い {の に}、大人 っぽい 話し 方 を する ね。
        english: He speaks maturely despite being young.
        hint: 「のに」 simply indicates a contrast or unexpected outcome, but 「割に」 specifically highlights
          a disproportion or unexpectedness relative to a quality (age, in this case).
    scene: A teacher commenting on a student's communication skills during a parent-teacher conference.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「年 の 割に」 (for his age) emphasizes the unexpected maturity of the student's speech. The casual
      「ね」 at the end makes it sound like a friendly observation between colleagues.
    etymology: The phrase leverages 「年」 (toshi) meaning age, and 「割に」 to describe an attribute (mature
      speech) that is unexpected given the subject's age. This shows the flexible application of 「割に」
      to various attributes for expressing disproportionate qualities.
  - english: Despite being so quiet, that cafe is surprisingly popular.
    japanese:
      - あの カフェ は 静か な {割 に}、結構 人気 が ある ん だ よ ね。
      - あの カフェ は 静か な {割 に は}、大変 人気 が あり ます ね。
    english_literally: That cafe, of quiet's proportion, quite popular exists, you know, right?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの カフェ は 静か だ け れ {ど も}、人気 が ある ね。
        english: That cafe is quiet, but it's popular.
        hint: 「けれど も」 is a simple 'but' or 'although'. 「割に」 adds the nuance that the popularity is disproportionate
          or unexpected **given** its quietness, rather than just stating two contrasting facts.
    scene: Friends discussing a local cafe they often visit.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「静か な 割に」 (for being quiet) points out the surprising popularity, implying that quiet places
      are typically less frequented. The use of 「ん だ よ ね」 softens the assertion and seeks agreement.
    etymology: Here, 「静か」 (shizuka), a な-adjective, is used with 「割に」 to highlight an unexpected characteristic.
      The expectation might be that quiet places are not bustling, but the reality defies this proportion.
  - english: For being such a difficult problem, it was resolved unexpectedly quickly.
    japanese:
      - 難しい {割 に}、その 問題 は 意外 と 早く 解決 し まし た。
      - 難しい {割 に は}、その 問題 は 意外 と 早く 解決 さ れ まし た。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 難しい 問題 でし た {が}、意外 と 早く 解決 し まし た。
        english: It was a difficult problem, but it was resolved surprisingly quickly.
        hint: 「が」 functions as a simple conjunction 'but'. 「割に」 emphasizes the **disproportion** between
          the problem's difficulty and the speed of its resolution, rather than just stating a contrast.
    scene: A project manager reporting on a challenge that was overcome more easily than expected.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「難しい 割に」 (for being difficult) expresses the surprise at the quick resolution, contrasting
      the perceived difficulty with the actual outcome. The use of 「ました」 maintains a formal tone appropriate
      for a professional setting.
    etymology: Using an い-adjective like 「難しい」 (muzukashii) with 「割に」 again illustrates its role in highlighting
      an unexpected outcome or attribute based on a primary characteristic. The inherent difficulty suggested
      a longer resolution time, but the outcome was disproportionately swift.
  - english: He says he's busy, but he surprisingly plays a lot.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 忙しい と 言う {割 に}、よく 遊ん で いる よ ね。
      - 彼 は 忙しい と 言っ て いる {割 に は}、よく 遊ん で い ます ね。

          - 彼 は 忙しい と 言っ て いる {の に}、よく 遊ん で いる ね。
        english: He says he's busy, but he's playing a lot.
        hint: While 「のに」 indicates a simple contrast, 「割に」 implies a judgment that the amount of playing
          is disproportionate to his claims of being busy, highlighting a perceived inconsistency in his
          behavior.
    scene: Colleagues casually discussing a mutual friend's schedule.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「言う 割に」 (for saying) highlights the contradiction between what he claims and his actions.
      The casual 「よ ね」 seeks subtle confirmation or agreement.
    etymology: This example uses a verb (言う - iu) with 「割に」 to describe an action that is disproportionate
      to a stated condition. The contrast between claiming to be busy and actually having much free time
      creates the unexpectedness.
  - english: The presentation, considering the short preparation time, was very well done.
    japanese:
      - 準備 期間 が 短い {割 に は}、プレゼンテーション は 非常 に よく でき て い まし た。

        english: Although the preparation period was short, the presentation was well done.
        hint: 「のに」 conveys 'although' or 'despite,' focusing on a simple contrasting fact. 「割に」 specifically
          highlights that the presentation's quality was unexpectedly high **given** (or in proportion
          to) the brevity of preparation.
    scene: A senior manager providing constructive feedback after a team's presentation.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「短い 割に は」 (for being short) points out the surprising quality of the presentation despite
      the limited time, suggesting it exceeded expectations for the given constraint. The use of 「ました」
      maintains formality.
    etymology: This sentence uses an い-adjective 「短い」 (mijikai) meaning short, to describe the preparation
      period. The phrase 「短い 割に は」 emphasizes that the quality of the presentation was unexpectedly high
      relative to the short time available for its preparation, showcasing the 'disproportionate' meaning.
  - english: That new restaurant, considering how simple it looks, serves surprisingly delicious food.
    japanese:
      - あの 新しい レストラン は 見 た 目 が 地味 な {割 に}、料理 が 驚く ほど 美味しい ん です よ。

          - あの 新しい レストラン は 見 た 目 が 地味 だ け れ {ど}、料理 が 驚く ほど 美味しい よ。
        english: That new restaurant looks plain, but the food is surprisingly delicious.
        hint: 「けれど」 is a general conjunction for contrast. 「割に」 specifically indicates that the deliciousness
          of the food is **disproportionate** to its simple appearance, suggesting an unexpected high
          quality given its humble look.
    scene: Two friends chatting about recently discovered eateries.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「地味 な 割に」 (for being plain-looking) highlights the unexpected culinary quality, implying that
      simpler establishments might not usually offer such delicious food. The use of 「ん です よ」 adds a personal,
      explanatory touch.
    etymology: Here, 「地味」 (jimi), a な-adjective meaning plain or understated, is used with 「割に」. It contrasts
      the restaurant's unpretentious exterior with the unexpectedly high quality of its cuisine, fitting
      the core meaning of disproportionate or surprising outcome given the initial characteristic.
  - english: Even though it was cheap, the quality of this coat is surprisingly good.
    japanese:
      - この コート は 安い {割 に}、なかなか 品質 が いい ね。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この コート は 安い {の に}、品質 が いい ね。
        english: This coat is cheap, but the quality is good.
        hint: 「のに」 signals a simple contrast. 「割に」 conveys that the good quality is **unexpectedly high**
          given the low price, indicating a disproportionate relationship between cost and quality.
    scene: Two friends shopping, one admiring a purchase made by the other.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「安い 割に」 (for being cheap) conveys a pleasant surprise about the quality, which usually correlates
      with price. The casual 「ね」 seeks confirmation from the listener.
    etymology: This example uses an い-adjective 「安い」 (yasui) meaning cheap, to describe the coat. The
      phrase 「安い 割に」 expresses that the quality of the coat is surprisingly good despite its low price,
      a clear demonstration of the 'unexpected' aspect of the grammar point.
  - english: I spent a lot of money, but I surprisingly didn't enjoy the trip that much.
    japanese:
      - たくさん お 金 を 使っ た {割 に は}、旅行 は そんな に 楽しく なかっ た な。
      - たくさん お 金 を 使っ た {割 に}、旅行 は あまり 楽しく なかっ た。
    english_literally: Lot of money spent's proportion, trip that much fun not was, you know.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - たくさん お 金 を 使っ た {の に}、旅行 は そんな に 楽しく なかっ た な。
        english: I spent a lot of money, but the trip wasn't that fun.
        hint: 「のに」 states a counter-expected result. 「割に」 emphasizes that the lack of enjoyment was **disproportionate**
          to the large amount of money spent, implying a poor return on the investment.
    scene: Someone reflecting on a past vacation that didn't meet expectations.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「使った 割に は」 (for having spent) highlights the unexpected lack of enjoyment despite significant
      expenditure, expressing a personal disappointment or regret. The final 「な」 indicates a self-reflection.
    etymology: Here, the past tense of a verb 「使った」 (tsukatta) meaning spent, is used. The phrase 「使った
      割に は」 expresses that the level of enjoyment was disproportionately low given the amount of money
      spent, showcasing the use of 「割に」 to describe an unexpected outcome of an action.
  - english: For a professional, his work is surprisingly sloppy.
    japanese:
      - プロ の {割 に}、彼 の 仕事 は 意外 と 雑 だ な。
      - プロ の {割 に は}、彼 の 仕事 は 意外 と 雑 です ね。
    english_literally: Professional's proportion, his work surprisingly sloppy is, you know.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - プロ {な の に}、彼 の 仕事 は 雑 だ な。
        english: Even though he's a professional, his work is sloppy.
        hint: 「なのに」 states a simple contradiction. 「割に」 specifically highlights that the sloppiness is
          **disproportionate** to what one would expect from a professional, implying a critical judgment
          of his skill level relative to his status.
    scene: Colleagues in a casual conversation, expressing dissatisfaction with someone's work quality.
    register: casual
    setting: creative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「プロ の 割に」 (for a professional) conveys dissatisfaction or surprise that a professional's work
      is of such low quality, as it is disproportionate to their title/status. The casual 「だ な」 shows
      a critical, almost exasperated tone.
    etymology: Using 「プロ」 (puro) meaning professional, a noun, with 「割に」 expresses a critical evaluation.
      The expectation for a professional's work is high quality, but here the work is 'sloppy', creating
      a clear disproportion.
  - english: Despite her young age, she surprisingly has extensive experience.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 若い {割 に}、経験 が 豊富 だ。
      - 彼女 は 若い {割 に は}、経験 が 豊富 です。
    english_literally: She, young's proportion, experience rich is.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 若い {の に}、経験 が 豊富 だ。
        english: She is young, but she has extensive experience.
        hint: 「のに」 conveys a simple 'but' or 'despite'. 「割に」 emphasizes that the extensive experience
          is **unexpected** or disproportionate to her youth, highlighting a surprising depth for her
          age.
    scene: A mentor discussing a promising junior colleague with another colleague.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「若い 割に」 (for being young) highlights the surprising extent of her experience, as one would
      typically expect less experience from someone young. The casual 「だ」 makes it a direct observation.
    etymology: The い-adjective 「若い」 (wakai) meaning young, combined with 「割に」, points to a surprising
      amount of experience despite youth, again fitting the meaning of disproportionate or unexpected
      quality.
post_example_writeup: The examples above demonstrate how 「割に」 is used across different parts of speech
  and contexts to express a sense of disproportion or unexpectedness. Pay close attention to the specific
  noun, adjective, or verb it modifies, as this context is crucial for understanding the unexpected element
  being highlighted. This phrase is a valuable tool for expressing nuance in Japanese, allowing you to
  convey that something is not quite as one might assume, given its characteristics.
