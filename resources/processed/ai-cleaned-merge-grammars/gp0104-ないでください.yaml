    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないでください」 is composed of: 「ない」, the negative form of a verb; the particle 「で」, indicating a state or condition; and 「ください」, the polite imperative form of 「くださる」, meaning \"to give\" (in this context, used to request a favor).",
    "writeup": "「ないでください」 is used to politely ask someone *not* to do something. It combines the negative form of a verb (ない), the particle 「で」, and 「ください」 (the polite imperative form of 「くださる」). 「ください」 functions almost exclusively for making requests. It is considered *keigo* (honorific language), a type of polite speech used to refer to others' actions.\n\nIn friendly conversation, 「ください」 may be omitted, and the 「で」 form itself can be used as a very casual way to say \"please don't do (A).\"\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nAlthough 「ください」 is the polite form of 「くれる」, using 「ないでくれ」 (the conjunctive form of 「くれる」) is generally considered too casual in most situations.",
