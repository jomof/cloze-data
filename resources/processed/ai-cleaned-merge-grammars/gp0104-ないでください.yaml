    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないでください」 is composed of: 「ない」, the negative form of a verb; the particle 「で」, indicating a state or condition; and 「ください」, the polite imperative form of 「くださる」, meaning \"to give\" (in this context, used to request a favor).",
    "writeup": "「ないでください」 is an expression used to politely ask someone *not* to do something. It is a combination of the casual negative form of a verb, the particle 「で」, and 「ください」, which is the conjunctive form of 「くださる」. 「くださる」 itself is the honorific language equivalent of 「くれる」 (to give).\n\n「くださる」 (kudasaru) is categorized as honorific language (敬語 - keigo), a polite form of speech used when referring to the actions of others. The 「ください」 (kudasai) form of 「くださる」 is used almost exclusively for making requests.\n\nIn friendly conversation, 「ください」 may be omitted from this expression, and the 「で」 form itself can be used as a very casual way to say \"please don't do (A)\".\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nAlthough 「ください」 is the polite form of 「くれる」, using 「ないでくれ」 (the conjunctive form of 「くれる」) is generally considered far too casual in most situations. Additionally, in casual speech, 「ください」 can be omitted, resulting in the request finishing in 「で」.",
