details:
  part-of-speech: prefix
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Can be used with nouns, adjectives, and verbs. For verbs, it's often used with 「になる」
    for honorific expressions and 「する」 for humble expressions.
  function: Adds politeness and respect to words.
  nuance: Not all nouns, adjectives, and verbs can be prefixed with 「お」. Generally used with native Japanese
    words (和語), not loanwords (外来語) or words of Chinese origin (漢語). However, there are exceptions.
etymology: The prefix 「お」 is derived from the honorific prefix 「御 (おん)」, which itself comes from classical
  Japanese. Over time, 「御」 simplified to 「お」 for easier use in everyday speech. It is often written in
  hiragana to distinguish it from the kanji 「御」.
writeup: |-
  The prefix 「お」 is used to add politeness and respect to nouns, adjectives, and verbs. It's a fundamental aspect of polite Japanese and shows consideration for the listener or the subject of the sentence. It's essential to note that 「お」 is typically attached to native Japanese words (和語), not loanwords (外来語) or words of Chinese origin (漢語). However, there are many exceptions to this rule, so learning through exposure and context is key.

  *   **Nouns:** Attaching 「お」 to nouns elevates the politeness of the word. Examples: 「お名前 (onamae)」 (name), 「お茶 (ocha)」 (tea), 「お弁当 (obentou)」 (boxed lunch).
  *   **Adjectives:** 「お」 can be attached to the stem of い-adjectives and な-adjectives to make them more polite. Examples: 「お忙しい (oisogashii)」 (busy), 「お元気 (ogenki)」 (healthy/well).
  *   **Verbs:** When used with verbs, 「お」 is combined with 「になる」 for honorific expressions (when someone else is doing the action) and with 「する」 for humble expressions (when the speaker is doing the action).

  It's important to remember that not all words can take the 「お」 prefix, and using it inappropriately can sound overly formal or even sarcastic. Learning which words commonly take 「お」 is crucial for speaking polite and natural Japanese. Pay attention to how native speakers use it and imitate their usage.

    meaning: Honorific prefix, similar to お
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ご」 is generally used with words of Chinese origin (漢語), while 「お」 is generally used with
      native Japanese words (和語). However, exceptions exist.

  - term: 様 (さま)
    meaning: Mr./Ms./Mrs., a very polite suffix
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「様」 is a suffix attached to names to show respect, while 「お」 is a prefix attached to nouns,
      adjectives, and verbs to add politeness.
    grammar_point: 様・さま (honorific suffix)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「お」 and 「ご」 add politeness, they attach to different kinds of words.
  Generally, 「お」 is used with native Japanese words (和語), and 「ご」 is used with words of Chinese origin
  (漢語). However, there are exceptions, so it's best to learn these usages through exposure. 「様」, on the
  other hand, is a suffix that attaches to names, titles, or even some nouns, showing a high level of
  respect towards the person or thing being referred to. These three are different so don't mix them up!

      individual.

  speaking to. Overusing it can sound overly formal or even sarcastic, while not using it when appropriate
  can come across as rude. Pay attention to how native speakers use it and try to emulate their usage.
