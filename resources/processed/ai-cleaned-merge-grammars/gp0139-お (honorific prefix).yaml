  part-of-speech: prefix
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to show respect or politeness towards the listener or the person/thing being spoken
    about. It can be used for humble expressions (kenjōgo) or respectful expressions (sonkeigo), as well
    as simply for beautifying language (美化語 bikago).
  function: To elevate the status of the noun or verb, or to humble the speaker's action, thereby contributing
    to overall politeness and refinement.
  nuance: Adds politeness and respect. Often implies carefulness, consideration, or a sense of formality.
    Its usage is culturally ingrained for appropriate social interactions.
etymology: The origin of 「お」 (o) as an honorific prefix stems from the classical Japanese honorific particle
  「おほ」 (oho), which was used to refer to things or people of high status. Over time, it underwent phonetic
  changes, simplifying to 「お」. Its role evolved from solely indicating nobility or divinity to a broader
  function of conveying politeness, respect, and sometimes simply beautifying language (美化語 bikago), particularly
  in addressing or referring to things associated with the listener or the context. This evolution reflects
  the strong emphasis on social hierarchy and politeness in Japanese language and culture, where linguistic
  forms are used to express deference.
writeup: |-
  The prefix 「お」 (o) is a fundamental component of honorific and polite Japanese, serving to elevate the status of a noun or verb, or to humble the speaker's action. It is broadly used across different levels of politeness, including `teineigo` (polite language), `sonkeigo` (respectful language), and `kenjōgo` (humble language).

  When attached to nouns, 「お」 often indicates respect for the object or person. For example, 「お名前」(おなまえ) means "your name" (respectful), 「お茶」(おちゃ) means "tea" (often a polite/beautifying use), or 「お金」(おかね) means "money" (bikago). While some nouns always take 「お」 (e.g., お茶), others take it only when politeness is required or for specific referents (e.g., お電話 for a phone call you receive).

  For verbs, 「お」 is typically combined with the ます-stem to form honorific expressions. In `sonkeigo`, it forms phrases like 「お帰りになる」(おかえりになる - to return, respectful) or 「お読みになる」(およみになる - to read, respectful). In `kenjōgo`, it forms expressions like 「お待ちする」(おまちする - to wait, humble) or 「お伝えする」(おつたえする - to tell, humble). These constructions are crucial for demonstrating proper social hierarchy in interactions.

  It is important to note that 「お」 is not universally applied. There are common words that do not take 「お」, particularly those of foreign origin (e.g., 「ビール」), or words that inherently do not require honorification. Overuse or incorrect application of 「お」 can sound unnatural or even condescending. Furthermore, some native Japanese words use 「ご」 (go) instead of 「お」, primarily words of Chinese origin (e.g., 「ご飯」(ごはん) - meal, 「ご家族」(ごかぞく) - family). The distinction between 「お」 and 「ご」 is usually based on the etymological origin of the word they precede.

  - term: ご (honorific prefix)
    meaning: honorific prefix (Chinese origin)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「お」 is typically used for native Japanese words (和語 wago), 「ご」 is generally used for
      words of Chinese origin (漢語 kango) when adding politeness. For example, 「ご連絡」(ごれんらく) for 'contact',
      instead of 「お連絡」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ご (honorific prefix)
post_false_friends_writeup: The most common point of confusion when using honorific prefixes is deciding
  between 「お」 and 「ご」. While both serve to elevate politeness, the general rule of thumb is to use 「お」
  for words of native Japanese origin (和語 wago) and 「ご」 for words of Chinese origin (漢語 kango). For instance,
  you would say 「お元気」(おげんき) using 「お」, but 「ご親切」(ごしんせつ) using 「ご」. There are exceptions, and some words
  can take both depending on context or specific usage, but adhering to the wago/kango distinction is
  a good starting point. Understanding this distinction helps in applying the correct prefix to maintain
  natural and appropriate politeness in Japanese.
examples:
  - english: What is your name?
    japanese:
      - お {名前} は 何 です か。
      - お {名前} は 何 でしょう か。
      - お {名前}、伺っ て よろしい です か。
    english_literally: As for your honorific name, what is it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 名前 は 何 です か。
        english: What is your name?
        hint: While grammatically correct, omitting the honorific 「お」 from 「お名前」 makes the question less
          polite and less formal. We're looking for a polite and respectful way to ask someone's name.
    scene: A new acquaintance is politely asking for your name.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    nuance: The 「お」 in 「お名前」 is a general polite prefix, making the question respectful when asking for
      someone's name. It's standard polite language used to show deference to the person being addressed.
  - english: Customer, shall I carry your luggage?
    japanese:
      - お 客 様、お {荷物} を お {持ち} し ましょう か。
      - お 客 様、お {荷物} を お {持ち} いたし ましょう か。
      - お 客 様、お {荷物} お 預かり し ましょう か。
    english_literally: Esteemed customer, shall I humbly carry your honorific luggage?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 客 様、荷物 を 持ち ましょう か。
        english: Customer, shall I carry the luggage?
        hint: This version lacks the honorific 「お」 for 'luggage' and the humble 「お持ちする」, making it less
          polite and not appropriate in a service context. We're looking for an expression that shows
          humility and respect.
    scene: A hotel staff member offers assistance to a guest.
    register: kenjōgo (humble)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「お荷物」 uses 「お」 as a respectful prefix for the customer's belongings. 「お持ちしましょうか」 is a humble
      expression, combining 「お」 with the ます-stem of 「持つ」 (to carry) and 「する」, showing humility from the
      speaker towards the listener. This is appropriate in a service context to elevate the customer and
      humble the speaker's action.
  - english: Has the teacher already returned?
    japanese:
      - 先生 は もう お {帰り} に なり まし た か。
      - 先生 は もう お {帰り} に なら れ まし た か。

    english_literally: As for teacher, has honorific return already happened?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 は もう 帰り まし た か。
        english: Has the teacher already returned?
        hint: While grammatically correct, this version uses the simple polite form 「帰りました」 (kaerimashita),
          which lacks the strong respect shown by 「お帰りになりました」 (okaeri ni narimashita). We're looking for
          a respectful expression to describe the teacher's action.
    scene: Students are discussing if their teacher has arrived back.
    register: sonkeigo (respectful)
    setting: academic
    nuance: 「お帰りになる」 is a respectful form of 「帰る」(かえる - to return), used to show reverence for the teacher's
      action. The 「お」 elevates the action of "returning" to a higher status, appropriate when speaking
      about someone superior like a teacher.
  - english: I apologize for interrupting you during your busy time, but could I have a little of your
      time?
    japanese:

      - お {忙しい} ところ 申し訳 ござい ませ ん が、少し お {時間} を いただけ ます か。

        english: I apologize for interrupting you during your busy time, but could I have a little of
          your time?
        hint: Omitting the 「お」 prefixes makes the phrase less formal and polite. In a business or highly
          formal setting, these honorifics are crucial for showing proper respect and consideration. We're
          looking for a highly polite and considerate expression.
    scene: A colleague needs to speak with a busy manager.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「お忙しい」 uses 「お」 with the i-adjective 「忙しい」(いそがしい - busy) to respectfully refer to the listener's
      busy state. 「お時間」 uses 「お」 for "time" in a polite context, showing consideration. Both contribute
      to the highly formal and polite tone suitable for a business interaction, indicating the speaker's
      awareness and respect for the listener's situation.
  - english: Please, eat/drink up.
    japanese:

    english_literally: Please, honorifically eat/drink.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - どうぞ、食べ て ください。
        english: Please, eat.
        hint: 「食べてください」 is a polite request, but 「お召し上がりください」 is the respectful form used when addressing
          a superior or guest. We're looking for a highly deferential way to invite someone to eat or
          drink.
    scene: A host serving food to guests.
    register: sonkeigo (respectful)
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「お召し上がりください」 is a respectful command, formed from 「召し上がる」(めしあがる - respectful form of 食べる/飲む)
      with the imperative 「ください」. The 「お」 here marks the beginning of this respectful verb phrase. This
      phrasing is used to show great deference to the guest's action of eating or drinking, common in
      hospitality settings.
  - english: Would you like some sake?
    japanese:
      - お {酒} は いかが です か。
      - お {酒} は いかが でしょう か。
      - お {酒}、お 飲み に なり ます か。
    english_literally: As for honorific sake, how about it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 酒 は いかが です か。
        english: How about sake?
        hint: Omitting the 「お」 from 「お酒」 makes the phrase less refined and polite, especially when offering
          something to a guest. We're looking for a polite way to offer something.
    scene: Offering a drink to a guest at a dinner party.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「お酒」 (おさけ) uses 「お」 as a general polite prefix (美化語 bikago) for "sake." It makes the offering
      sound more refined and polite, suitable for hospitality, implying a soft, welcoming tone.
  - english: I wrote a letter for you.
    japanese:
      - お {手紙} を お {書き} し まし た。
      - お {手紙} を お {書き} いたし まし た。

    english_literally: Honorific letter, I humbly wrote.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 手紙 を 書き まし た。
        english: I wrote a letter.
        hint: This is a simple polite statement without the humble or honorific nuances. In a professional
          or formal context, using 「お」 for both the object and the action shows greater respect to the
          recipient or for whom the action was performed. We're looking for an expression that humbly
          describes the speaker's action for someone else.
    scene: An assistant informs their boss about completing a task.
    register: kenjōgo (humble)
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「お手紙」 is a polite reference to "letter," often used when referring to a letter belonging to
      or for someone else. 「お書きしました」 is a humble expression of the action "to write" (書く kaku), using
      the ます-stem 「書き」 with 「お」 and 「する」, emphasizing the speaker's humble service to the listener or
      recipient, which is appropriate for a subordinate speaking to a superior.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 社長 が 話し ます。
        english: The president speaks.
        hint: 「話します」 is polite, but it doesn't show the high level of respect for the president's action
          that 「お話しになります」 does. We're looking for a respectful way to describe the president's action.
    scene: Announcing the president's address at a company meeting.
    register: sonkeigo (respectful)
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「お話しになります」 is a respectful form of 「話す」(はなす - to speak), showing deference to the president's
      action. The 「お」 elevates the act of speaking, highlighting the president's superior status and the

          - 体、大切 に し て ください。

        hint: Omitting 「お」 from 「お体」 makes the phrase less polite and caring, especially when expressing
          concern for someone's well-being. We're looking for a considerate and polite expression.
    scene: Saying goodbye to someone who is not feeling well.
    register: formal
    setting: cautious
    nuance: 「お体」 uses 「お」 as a respectful prefix for "body," implying the listener's precious health.
      This phrase is a common polite and caring expression used when expressing concern for someone's
      well-being, demonstrating a considerate and gentle tone.
  - english: Are you off tomorrow?
    japanese:
      - 明日 は お {休み} です か。

      - 明日 は お {休み} に なら れ ます か。
    english_literally: As for tomorrow, is it honorific rest?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 は 休み です か。
        english: Are you off tomorrow?
        hint: While 「休みですか」 is polite, adding 「お」 to 「お休み」 makes the question more considerate and natural
          when asking about someone's personal time. We're looking for a polite way to inquire about a
          day off.
    scene: A coworker asking about your day off.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「お休み」 uses 「お」 for "day off" or "rest." It's a common polite form for this noun, used when
      inquiring about someone else's personal time, reflecting general consideration and a natural polite
      tone in professional or semi-formal settings.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, the prefix 「お」 plays a vital role in conveying
  politeness and respect in Japanese. Its usage varies depending on whether it's applied to nouns, adjectives,
  or verbs, and whether the intention is to show humility (kenjōgo), respect (sonkeigo), or simply to
  use beautiful language (bikago). Mastering the appropriate use of 「お」 is key to sounding natural and
  navigating various social situations in Japanese.
