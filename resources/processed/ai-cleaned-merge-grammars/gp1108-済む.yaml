    "etymology": "The verb 「済む (すむ)」 originally meant \"to finish\" or \"to complete.\" Over time, its meaning expanded to include the idea of something being sufficient or enough to resolve a situation. It shares a root with 「済ませる (すませる)」, which means \"to finish\" or \"to settle (transitive).\"",
    "writeup": "「済む (すむ)」 is a versatile intransitive verb that conveys the idea of something being **sufficient**, **enough**, or **completed** with minimal effort or resources. It expresses that a situation can be resolved, a task can be accomplished, or a need can be met without requiring extensive measures. This often implies a sense of relief or efficiency in achieving a satisfactory outcome.\n\nIt can be used in various contexts:\n\n*   **Cost or Time**: To indicate something costs or takes only a certain amount of money or time.\n*   **Requirements**: To show that something is enough or can be managed with minimal requirements or conditions.\n*   **Avoidance**: To express that one can avoid doing something or that something is not necessary, leading to a simpler resolution.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「済む」 inherently implies that a particular condition or action is adequate to bring about a desired outcome, often simplifying a potentially complex situation.\n*   While it has a general meaning of 'to finish' or 'to be over', its nuance in this grammatical context emphasizes 'being sufficient' or 'getting by' with less than might be expected.",
