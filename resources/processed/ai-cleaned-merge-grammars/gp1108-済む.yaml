    "writeup": "**済む (sumu)** carries the core meaning of \"to be finished\" or \"to be completed.\" However, it extends beyond simple completion to encompass concepts of sufficiency, adequacy, and managing with minimal requirements.\n\nIt indicates that a situation is resolved, a need is met, or a task can be accomplished with the least possible effort, cost, or resources. The usage spans a range of registers, from casual everyday conversation to more formal settings, depending on the context.\n\nHere are some key usages:\n\n*   **Completion:** Expressing that something has come to an end.\n*   **Sufficiency:** Indicating that something is enough or adequate for a particular purpose.\n*   **Minimization:** Suggesting that a situation can be handled with the least amount of effort or resources.\n*   **Getting Away With:** Indicating that one can avoid negative consequences or manage with minimal repercussions. For example, 「謝って済む」 \"get by with apologizing\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The nuance of 「済む」 often implies a sense of relief or satisfaction that a situation was resolved without major complications or excessive effort. For example, 「警告だけで済んだ」 \"got off with just a warning\".\n*   The phrase 「〜で済む」 means \"to get by with ~\" or \"to be enough with ~\".\n*   The negative form 「〜では済まない」 means \"it's not enough to just ~\" or \"won't get away with ~\".",

    "etymology": "The etymology of 「済む」 (sumu) is linked to the idea of completion and resolution. The kanji 済 combines the elements of 「水」 (mizu, meaning water) and 「斉」 (sei, meaning equal or uniform). The association with water suggests a cleansing or purifying action, implying the removal of something incomplete or unresolved, leading to a state of completion. The 「斉」 component suggests that things are now in order, balanced, or equalized, reinforcing the sense of resolution or completion. Over time, the meaning of 「済む」 expanded to include not only finishing or completing something but also the idea of sufficiency, adequacy, and managing with minimal requirements. This evolution reflects the notion that when something is completed or resolved, it often satisfies the needs or requirements at hand.",

When you want to express that something is not only finished but also sufficient or resolved with minimal effort, 「済む」 is the more appropriate choice. 「終える」 is simply completing the task."
