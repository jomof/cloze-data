    "etymology": "The suffix 「い」 has been used in Japanese adjectives for centuries. It's a core part of the adjective and indicates a quality or characteristic.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese grammar, い-adjectives (い形容詞, *i-keiyōshi*) are a distinct category of adjectives. They are characterized by ending in the hiragana 「い」 in their dictionary form and are used to describe nouns. They are often referred to as 'true adjectives' due to their unique conjugational patterns, which differ significantly from those of な-adjectives.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nA crucial point to remember is that い-adjectives **never** directly follow 「だ」. While it is extremely common and widely accepted for politeness, adding 「です」 after an い-adjective (e.g., 暑いです) is technically considered grammatically irregular, as 「です」 historically functions similarly to 「だ」, which only attaches to nouns or な-adjectives. However, this usage is so prevalent that it is part of natural Japanese speech.\n\nIt is vital to distinguish true い-adjectives from other words that simply end in 「い」 but function differently. For instance, words like 「きれい」 (beautiful, clean) and 「きらい」 (disliked, hateful) are **not** い-adjectives, despite their ending. 「きれい」, for example, comes from the kanji 綺麗 where 「い」 is part of the kanji itself, unlike true い-adjectives where the 「い」 suffix is always separable from the kanji stem. These words function grammatically as な-adjectives, requiring 「な」 when modifying a noun (e.g., きれいな花, きらいな食べ物). While there isn't a strict rule for discerning all such words, their number is limited, and familiarity comes with exposure.",
