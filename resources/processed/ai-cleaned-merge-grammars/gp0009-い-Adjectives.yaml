    "etymology": "The suffix 「い」 has been used in Japanese adjectives for centuries. It's a core part of the adjective and indicates a quality or characteristic.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese grammar, *i*-adjectives (い形容詞, *i-keiyōshi*) are a type of adjective that ends with the hiragana 「い」 in their dictionary form. These adjectives directly modify nouns and can be conjugated to express different tenses or nuances. They are sometimes called \"true adjectives\" because they behave differently from *na*-adjectives. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Unlike *na*-adjectives, *i*-adjectives **never** take 「だ」. To be polite, you can add 「です」 to the end, though this is technically incorrect. \n*   Not all words ending in 「い」 are *i*-adjectives. Examples include 「きれい」 and 「きらい」.",
