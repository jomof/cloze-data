    "etymology": "The term い-Adjective comes from the fact that these adjectives always end in the hiragana い. 形容詞 (keiyōshi) means adjective.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, い-Adjectives, or い-形容詞 (i-keiyōshi), are a class of words used to describe nouns. A key characteristic is that they **always end in い** in their dictionary form. \n\nHowever, **not all words ending in い are い-Adjectives**. Some words, such as きれい (きれい), which comes from the kanji 綺麗, include い as part of the root word or kanji. In true い-Adjectives, the い is a suffix, outside of the kanji, and can be conjugated. \n\nThere isn't a definitive rule to distinguish which words ending in い are not い-Adjectives, but fortunately, there aren't many exceptions, so you'll become familiar with them over time.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n*   Unlike な-Adjectives, い-Adjectives **must never be followed by だ**. です is used to make them sound more polite, though this is technically grammatically incorrect (since です is a polite form of だ and follows the same rules).",
