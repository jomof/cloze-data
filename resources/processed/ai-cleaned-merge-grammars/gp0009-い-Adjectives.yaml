    "etymology": "The suffix 「い」 has been used in Japanese adjectives for centuries. It's a core part of the adjective and indicates a quality or characteristic.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese grammar, い-adjectives (い形容詞, *i-keiyōshi*) are a fundamental category of words used to describe qualities or characteristics. They are easily identifiable by their dictionary form always ending in the hiragana 「い」. They are sometimes called 'true adjectives' because, unlike な-adjectives, their inflectional endings change directly to modify meaning, rather than requiring an auxiliary like 「な」 or 「だ」.\n\nA critical point to understand is that い-adjectives **never** directly attach to 「だ」. This is a common mistake for learners. While 「です」 is frequently used after an い-adjective for politeness (e.g., 暑いです - 'It is hot'), it is technically an irregular usage from a purely linguistic standpoint. Historically, 「です」 is a polite form of 「だ」 and should only attach to nouns or な-adjectives. However, this usage with い-adjectives has become so ingrained in modern Japanese that it is universally accepted and sounds entirely natural to native speakers. You will hear it constantly.\n\nIt is also crucial to distinguish true い-adjectives from other words that simply end in 「い」 but are not classified as such. For example, 「きれい」 (beautiful/clean) and 「きらい」 (disliked/hated) are **not** い-adjectives. They are, in fact, な-adjectives, and the 「い」 in these words is part of the kanji structure (e.g., 綺麗 for きれい) rather than a grammatical suffix. When modifying a noun, they require 「な」 (e.g., きれいな花 - 'a beautiful flower'). While there are not many such exceptions, recognizing them comes with exposure and practice.",
