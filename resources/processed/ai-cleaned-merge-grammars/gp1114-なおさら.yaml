    },
    "etymology": "The word 「なおさら」 is thought to come from 「猶更」 (nao sara), where 「猶」 (nao) means \"still, yet\" and 「更」 (sara) means \"more, further\". Thus, the combination implies an increase or intensification.",
    "writeup": "「なおさら」 is an adverb that emphasizes the degree of something, indicating it is \"even more\" or \"still more\" than before due to a specific reason or circumstance. It conveys a stronger sense of intensification than words like 「もっと」 or 「さらに」. It's used to highlight how a condition or feeling is amplified. While adaptable to various situations, it often appears in more formal or semi-formal settings.",
