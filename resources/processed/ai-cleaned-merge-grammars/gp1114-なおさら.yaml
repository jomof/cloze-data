    "etymology": "The word 「なおさら」 is thought to come from 「猶更」 (nao sara), where 「猶」 (nao) means \"still, yet\" and 「更」 (sara) means \"more, further\". Thus, the combination implies an increase or intensification.",

It conveys a stronger sense of intensification than words like 「もっと」 or 「さらに」. It's used to highlight how a condition or feeling is amplified. While adaptable to various situations, it often appears in more formal or semi-formal settings.",
