jlpt: N3
etymology: The phrase 「でもいいなら」 is a combination of several basic Japanese grammatical elements. 「でも」 combines
  the particle 「で」 (meaning "at," "by," or serving as a conjunctive particle for nouns/na-adjectives)
  and 「も」 (meaning "even" or "also"). This combination forms the nuance of "even if," indicating inclusion
  or concession. 「いい」 is a common adjective meaning "good," "fine," or "acceptable." 「なら」 is a conditional
  particle, derived from the verb 「なる」 (to become), which introduces a condition. Thus, 「でもいいなら」 literally
  means "if it is fine/acceptable even with/by [X]," conveying the idea of conditional acceptance for
  a less-than-ideal or alternative option. It highlights a pragmatic acceptance when other options might
  be preferred or unavailable.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「でもいいなら」 is a versatile expression used to propose or inquire about the acceptability of an alternative or compromise. It translates roughly to "if even [X] is acceptable" or "if [X] will do." This construction is particularly useful when the speaker needs to offer a less ideal option, suggest a fallback plan, or confirm whether a certain condition or item is satisfactory, especially when a preferred choice is not an option. The phrase is built upon the particle 「でも」, which conveys the nuance of "even if" or "even though," introducing a concession. This is then combined with 「いい」, meaning "good" or "acceptable," to form 「でもいい」 ("even if [X] is good/acceptable"). Finally, the conditional particle 「なら」 is appended, creating a conditional clause: "if it's acceptable even if [X]."

  「でもいいなら」 is flexible in its usage and can follow various parts of speech:
  *   **Nouns:** A noun followed by 「でもいいなら」 suggests that even that noun, possibly a substitute, is acceptable. For example, 「コーヒー**でもいいなら**」 (if even coffee is okay) implies that coffee might not be the first choice but is an acceptable alternative.
  *   **い-Adjectives:** When an い-adjective (in its て-form 「くて」) precedes 「もいいなら」, it means "if even being [adjective] is acceptable." For instance, 「小さ**くてもいいなら**」 (if even being small is okay) implies size might be a compromise.
  *   **な-Adjectives:** For な-adjectives (in their て-form 「で」), the structure is similar: 「静か**でもいいなら**」 (if even being quiet is okay).
  *   **Verbs:** Verbs in their て-form followed by 「もいいなら」 indicate that "if even performing [action] is acceptable." For example, 「歩い**てもいいなら**」 (if even walking is okay) suggests walking as a viable, albeit possibly less convenient, option.

  This grammar point is neutral in register and can be used in both casual and more formal conversations, with politeness being conveyed by the sentence-ending particles or verb conjugations that follow. It emphasizes pragmatism and willingness to adapt to circumstances.
false_friends:
  - term: ならいい
    meaning: if that's good/if it's good then
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ならいい」 states a condition for something to be good or satisfactory without the "even" nuance
      of concession. It simply means "if X is the case, then it's good/fine." 「でもいいなら」 specifically implies
      that a less ideal option is being considered or accepted.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ならいい (if it's good)
  - term: 〜てもかまわない
    meaning: it doesn't matter if; it's alright to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てもかまわない」 implies indifference or a lack of objection ("I don't care if..."). While the outcome
      is similar (it's acceptable), 「でもいいなら」 conveys a sense of active acceptance or suitability for an
      alternative, often implying a compromise or a less preferred option. 「かまわない」 is more about "no problem,"
      while 「いい」 is "good/acceptable."
    grammar_point: 〜てもかまわない (it doesn't matter if)
post_false_friends_writeup: When considering 「でもいいなら」, it is important to distinguish its nuance from
  similar expressions. While 「ならいい」 also uses a conditional, it lacks the concessive "even" (でも) part,
  simply stating that "if X, then it's good." This means 「ならいい」 is used when X is a desirable condition
  leading to a positive outcome, whereas 「でもいいなら」 is for when X is a less-than-ideal but acceptable alternative.
  Similarly, 「〜てもかまわない」 conveys that something is permissible or that one has no objection, often implying
  a degree of indifference. 「でもいいなら」, on the other hand, suggests a more deliberate acceptance of a compromise,
  highlighting that the chosen alternative, though not optimal, is suitable.

        hint: 「なら」 simply states a condition for something to be possible, but doesn't imply it's a second
          choice. We're looking for a phrase that implies "even if it's instant ramen (which might not
          be ideal), it's acceptable." This is a simple conditional. We're looking for an acceptance of
          a possibly less thorough option.

        hint: 「なら」 simply states a condition without the nuance of concession. We're looking for a phrase

          a condition and a fact. We're looking for an acceptance of a possibly less thorough option.
