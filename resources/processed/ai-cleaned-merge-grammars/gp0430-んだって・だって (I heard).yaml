jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used in informal conversations to report information heard from others, express mild
    surprise, or seek confirmation.
  function: Hearsay marker; informal confirmation.
  nuance: んだって often implies a stronger sense of 'I heard it' or 'it is said', sometimes with a hint of
    surprise or mild disbelief, due to the explanatory 'ん'. だって is generally more straightforward for
    simply relaying information, although it can also convey surprise depending on intonation.
etymology: These expressions derive from 「のだ」/「だ」 + と言う + て (or its corrupted form). 「の」 (ん) provides
  an explanatory or emphatic nuance, and 「と」 marks a quotation. The verb 「言う」 (to say) combined with the
  て-form creates a reporting structure, which informally became 「んだって」 or 「だって」 to mean 'I heard that'
  or 'apparently'.
writeup: 「んだって」 and 「だって」 are versatile informal expressions used to report information that the speaker
  has heard from someone else, or that is generally known. They function similarly to 'I heard that' or
  'apparently' in English. Both are highly casual and frequently used in daily conversations, especially
  among friends and family. While they share a core meaning, 「んだって」 often carries a nuance of slight surprise,
  confirmation-seeking, or emphasis, as it incorporates the explanatory 「の」/「ん」 particle. For example,
  if someone tells you a surprising piece of news, you might use 「んだって」 to express your astonishment while
  repeating the information. 「だって」 is generally more straightforward for simply relaying information.
  It can also be used as a conjunction meaning 'because' or 'but', adding to its versatility, though in
  this grammar point, we focus on its hearsay function. It's important to distinguish this use from the
  conjunction. Neither form is appropriate for formal or business settings. For those contexts, phrases
  like 「によると」 or 「だそうです」 are preferred.

  - term: そうだ
    meaning: I heard that (neutral, objective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そうだ」 conveys hearsay objectively, without the casualness or nuance of surprise that 「んだって・だって」
      can carry. It simply states what was heard.
    grammar_point: そうだ (hear that)
  - term: によると・によれば
    meaning: according to (formal hearsay)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「によると・によれば」 is more formal and specifies the source of information, making it suitable for
      academic or professional contexts, unlike the casual 「んだって・だって」.
    grammar_point: によると・によれば (according to)
  - term: とかで
    meaning: for reasons such as; supposedly because (uncertain reason)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とかで」 implies uncertainty about the reason or the information itself, often used when the
      speaker is not fully convinced or precise about the details, whereas 「んだって・だって」 is more direct in
      reporting.
    grammar_point: とかで (uncertain reason)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「そうだ」, 「によると・によれば」, and 「とかで」 all relate to reporting information, remember
  that 「んだって・だって」 are highly informal. Choose your expression based on the level of formality and the
  nuance of certainty or surprise you wish to convey.

post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, the choice between 「んだって」 and 「だって」 often comes
  down to a subtle difference in nuance and emphasis, particularly around conveying the speaker's surprise
  or confirmation-seeking. Intonation plays a crucial role in distinguishing the various shades of meaning.
