  meaning: I heard that; He/She said that
  pronunciation:
    katakana: ンダッテ
    romaji: nda tte
  formation:
    '[Sentence] + んだって': Indicates that the speaker heard something (casual).
  jlpt: N3
  details:
    part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
    register: casual
    usage-context: Used among close friends/equals
  etymology: The grammar point 「んだって」 is a combination of 「ん」 (a shortened form of 「の」 used to provide explanation),
    「だ」 (the copula 'to be,' indicating assertion), and 「って」 (a colloquial abbreviation of 「と言って」, meaning
    'said'). Thus, it literally translates to 'it is that (A) was said'.
  writeup: 「んだって」 is used at the end of sentences to express information the speaker has heard from someone
    else. It's a casual way of saying "I heard that..." or "Someone said that...". Because 「んだって」 is quite
    casual, it's best used in conversations with friends or people you're close to. It is often used in
    informal conversation to pass along information without necessarily vouching for its accuracy.
  false_friends:
    - term: と聞いた
      meaning: I heard that
      kind: synonym
      nuance: Unlike 「んだって」, 「と聞いた」 is a more formal phrase suitable for wider social contexts, often implying
        a more direct or reliable source.
      grammar_point: ときいた (I heard that)
    - term: って (quotation)
      meaning: Casual quotation
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「って」 indicates reported speech, it is usually a direct or near-direct quote, whereas
        「んだって」 is used for more general hearsay or simply relaying information.
      grammar_point: って (quotation)
    - term: とか
      meaning: I heard that… something like, They said ... or something
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「とか」 conveys uncertainty or lists possibilities with a vague or dismissive nuance. In contrast,
        「んだって」 directly reports something heard.
      grammar_point: とか (hearsay)
    - term: らしい (I hear, it seems)
      meaning: Seems like; Apparently; I heard
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「らしい」 implies the speaker's deduction from evidence, not direct hearsay. 「んだって」, on the other
        hand, specifically reports information that was heard.
      grammar_point: らしい (I hear, it seems)
    - term: そうだ (hear that)
      meaning: I heard that, It is said that
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「そうだ」 (hearsay) often carries a higher degree of confidence than 「んだって」, or it can describe
        direct sensory observation ('it looks like').
      grammar_point: そうだ (hear that)
    - term: だって (even, too)
      meaning: Because, But, Even or also, Even if or even though
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: 「だって」 has various uses, such as 'because' or 'but', and often serves as a conversational filler
        or mild protest. 「んだって」, however, specifically reports hearsay, combining the explanatory 「ん」 with
        「だって」.
      grammar_point: だって (even, too)
  post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「んだって」 is primarily used for relaying information
    you've heard, emphasizing the source is external to yourself. When you want to express your own reasoning
    or use a more formal expression, consider alternatives like 「から」, 「と聞いた」, or 「そうだ」.
  examples:

          english: I heard that Yamada-san is taking tomorrow off from work.

          english: It seems Yamada-san is taking tomorrow off from work.

      scene: Two colleagues are chatting in the breakroom about their coworker Yamada-san.
      register: casual
      setting: informative

      scene: Students are talking in the hallway during a break about their new instructor.
      register: casual
      setting: academic
      nuance: The use of 「んだって」 in this context, combined with the plain form 「優しい」, creates a natural,
        casual tone appropriate for students sharing informal news.

      register: casual
      setting: friendly

        of casual conversational Japanese. This sharing of personal information among friends is common,
        and the casual nature of 「んだって」 fits this context.

      japanese:
        - 先週 の パーティー、めちゃくちゃ 盛り上がっ た {ん だ って}。

          english: Last week's party seemed super lively.

      register: casual
      setting: friendly

            explicitly told you about the computer.
      scene: An IT technician is venting to a colleague about a frequently malfunctioning computer.
      register: casual
      setting: serious
      nuance: The frustration is conveyed by the added phrase 「もう 勘弁 し て ほしい よ」. The use of 「んだって」 here
        indicates the speaker heard this from someone else (e.g., a user). This style of venting is common
        among colleagues.
    - english: I heard that famous idol secretly got married recently. That's a surprise, isn't it?

        - 会議 の 時間、3 時 に 変わっ た {ん だ って}。
        - 3 時 に 変わっ た {ん だ って}、会議 の 時間。
      english_literally: The meeting's time, it is said it changed to 3 o'clock.
      competing_grammar:

            - 会議 の 時間 が 3 時 に 変わっ た {と 聞い た}。
          english: I heard the meeting time has changed to 3 PM.
          hint: 「と聞いた」 is a formal phrase. For quick updates among colleagues, a more casual expression
            is often preferred.

          english: It seems the meeting time has changed to 3 PM.
          hint: 「らしい」 suggests an inference, not a direct report. We need a phrase to state information
            that was heard.
      scene: Two colleagues are quickly confirming a schedule change in the office hallway.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      nuance: This sentence, delivered using the casual 「んだって」, is suitable for a quick, informal update
        about a schedule change. While the content is professional, the delivery is casual, common when
        relaying information among peers.
  post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「んだって」 integrates seamlessly into various sentence
    structures, often involving omitted particles or subjects common in casual Japanese. Pay attention to
    the particle preceding 「んだって」, especially for nouns and na-adjectives, where 「な」 (or its contracted
    form 「ん」) is often inserted. Understanding these subtle variations will help you use 「んだって」 more naturally
    in your conversations.

  jlpt: N3
  details:
    part-of-speech: conjunction
    register: casual
    usage-context: general
  etymology: だって is a colloquial contraction of だとて (da to te), where だ is the plain form of the copula
    です (desu), and とて (tote) is an adverbial particle meaning "even if" or "even though." Over time, だとて
    simplified to だって, retaining its function of introducing a reason or explanation.
  writeup: |-
    だって is a versatile expression primarily used in casual conversation. It combines だ (the copula) with the adverbial particle とて. Its main function is to introduce a reason or explanation, often with a hint of displeasure or defensiveness. Think of it as a more emphatic "because." When used at the beginning of a sentence, it prefaces an explanation or counterpoint, similar to でも (demo).

    When used as んだって (n datte) at the end of a sentence, it conveys hearsay, like "I heard that..." This usage is considered more casual and can sound a bit childish, especially when followed by もん (mon) or もの (mono). It's essential to be mindful of the context to accurately interpret its meaning.

      meaning: I heard that; it means that
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「ということだ」 conveys hearsay, it's more formal and lacks the casual, sometimes childish,
        nuance of 「だって」.
      grammar_point: ということ (nominalizer・conclusion)
    - term: ときいた (I heard that)
      meaning: I heard that
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「ときいた」 is a more direct and formal way of saying "I heard that," without the added nuance
        of explanation or excuse found in 「だって」.
      grammar_point: ときいた (I heard that)
    - term: それでも (even so)
      meaning: But still; even so
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「それでも」 expresses a contrast or concession despite a previous statement, whereas 「だって」 primarily
        provides a reason or explanation or emphasizes an unexpected inclusion.
      grammar_point: それでも (even so)
    - term: なぜなら〜から (emphasized reason)
      meaning: Because; the reason is
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「なぜなら〜から」 is a more formal and direct way of stating a reason, lacking the casual, emotional,
        and sometimes defensive tone of 「だって」.
      grammar_point: なぜなら〜から (emphasized reason)
    - term: (っ)たって (even if)
      meaning: Even if; even though
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: 「たって」 focuses on hypothetical situations or concessions and is a contraction of 「ても」, whereas
        「だって」 is a conjunction or particle for reasons and emphasis, and is a contraction of 「だとて」. They
        are homophones but distinct in meaning and origin.
      grammar_point: (っ)たって (even if)
    - term: から (reason cause)
      meaning: Because; since
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「から」 states a neutral reason, 「だって」 introduces a reason with a more personal, emotional,
        or sometimes defensive nuance, often implying 'because, you know?' or 'no, because...'.
      grammar_point: から (reason cause)
    - term: もの・もん (because・since)
      meaning: Because; since
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「もん」 is very similar to 「だって」 for casual reasons, often used by women and children, but 「だって」
        can carry a stronger sense of argument or direct response to an implied question/accusation, especially
        when used to start a sentence.
      grammar_point: もの・もん (because・since)
    - term: そうだ (hear that)
      meaning: I heard that; It is said that
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「そうだ」 (hearsay) is a standard way to convey reported information. 「だって」 (hearsay) is more
        casual and often used in informal gossip or quick updates among peers.
      grammar_point: そうだ (hear that)
    - term: らしい (I hear, it seems)
      meaning: I hear, it seems
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「らしい」 conveys information based on observation or impression ('it seems/appears that'), while

      grammar_point: らしい (I hear, it seems)
    - term: でも (even・any・no matter)
      meaning: Even; or something; any (with question words); no matter (who/what/where/when)
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Both mean 'even', but 「だって」 often carries a nuance of surprise or an unexpected inclusion,
        sometimes implying 'even this surprising thing' or 'even someone like that'.
      grammar_point: でも (even・any・no matter)
    - term: も (addition or emphasis particle)
      meaning: Also, too, as well, even, either, neither
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「も」 means 'also' or 'even' in a general sense. 「だって」 adds a stronger, more emphatic 'even'
        or 'also', often in contexts where the inclusion is notable or surprising.
      grammar_point: も (addition or emphasis particle)
  post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, consider the level of formality and the specific nuance
    you want to convey. If you're simply relaying information without adding personal explanation or strong
    emphasis, more neutral options like 「から」 or 「そうだ」 might be more appropriate. For more formal hearsay,
    use 「ということだ」 or 「ときいた」. If you want to concede a point despite something else, use 「それでも」. 「だって」 is
    best used when you want to give a casual, often emotional or defensive, reason, or to emphatically include
    something surprising, or for informal hearsay among peers.
  examples:
    - english: Ahh, I don't want to go. It's because that guy's coming, isn't it?
      japanese:
        - ああ、行き たく ない よ。{だ って}、あいつ も 来る ん だろ？
        - ああ、行き たく ない よ。{だ って}、あいつ も 来る ん でしょ？

          english: Ahh, I don't want to go. It's because that guy's coming, isn't it?
          hint: While 「から」 states a neutral reason, 「だって」 conveys a more personal or slightly defensive
            explanation. We're looking for a more emphatic or emotional reason.
      scene: A young man reluctantly talks to his friend about a party.
      register: casual
      setting: humorous
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The opening 「ああ」 expresses a sigh or groan, indicating reluctance. The use of 「あいつ」 for 'that
        guy' is casual and slightly derogatory. This expression of a personal, somewhat whiny reason is
        typical for 「だって」 in this context.
    - english: It's because I'm scared of bugs and stuff.
      japanese:
        - '{だ って}、虫 と か 怖い もん。'
        - '{だ って}、虫 と か 怖い から。'
        - '{だ って}、虫 と か 怖い の よ。'

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 虫 と か 怖い {から}。
          english: It's because I'm scared of bugs and stuff.
          hint: 「から」 simply states a reason. We're looking for a more personal, emotional, or slightly childish
            reason, often used by women and children.
      scene: A little girl explains to her mother why she doesn't want to play outside.
      register: casual
      setting: serious
      speaker_gender: female
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The 「もん」 at the end emphasizes the speaker's reason and is often used by women and children,
        adding a slightly softer, more personal tone to the explanation. 「とか」 means 'and stuff like that'.
    - english: I don't want to eat that either. It's because it tastes bad.
      japanese:
        - 私 も そんな の 食べ たく ない よ。{だ って}、まずい ん だ もん。

          english: I don't want to eat that either. It's because it tastes bad.
          hint: While 「から」 states a neutral reason, 「だって」 combined with 「もん」 adds a softer, more personal,
            or slightly defensive nuance to the excuse, often used by female speakers.
      scene: A woman expressing strong distaste for a dish her friend offered.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The phrase 「まずい ん だもん」 uses 「んだ」 for emphasis and 「もん」 to convey a personal, emotional reason,
        typically used by women or children. The speaker uses 「私」, a neutral way for females to refer to
        themselves.
    - english: Even she can speak English.
      japanese:
        - 彼女 {だ って} 英語 が 話せる よ。
        - 彼女 {だ って} 英語 話せる よ。
        - 彼女 {だ って} 英語 が 話せる。

        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼女 {も} 英語 が 話せる よ。
          english: She can also speak English.
          hint: 「も」 means 'also' or 'too'. We're looking for a stronger emphasis on 'even', implying a sense
            of surprise or unexpectedness regarding her ability.
      scene: A friend is surprised to learn about a quiet acquaintance's hidden talent.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      nuance: In this context, 「だって」 highlights an unexpected inclusion, suggesting that the listener might
        not have thought this person capable of speaking English, conveying a sense of surprise or discovery.
    - english: If you say something like that, even a child would get hurt.
      japanese:
        - そんな こと 言っ たら、子供 {だ って} 傷つく よ。

            - そんな こと 言っ たら、子供 {で も} 傷つく よ。
          english: If you say something like that, even a child would get hurt.
          hint: 「でも」 can mean 'even' but 「だって」 here emphasizes the universal impact, suggesting that *anyone*,
            including the seemingly most innocent, would be affected.
      scene: A teacher admonishing a student for using harsh words.
      register: formal
      setting: serious
      nuance: The use of 「子供 だって」 emphasizes the universal impact of harsh words, suggesting that even someone
        typically resilient or innocent like a child would be affected. The direct tone is appropriate for
        an admonishment.
    - english: I heard Mr. Yamada is getting married next month.
      japanese:
        - 山田 さん は 来月 結婚 する ん {だ って}。

        - 山田 さん は 来月 結婚 する ん {だ って} よ。

            - 山田 さん は 来月 結婚 する {そう だ}。
          english: I heard Mr. Yamada is getting married next month.
          hint: 「そうだ」 indicates hearsay, but 「んだって」 is a more casual way to relay information you've heard,
            especially among peers or for light gossip.
      scene: Colleagues informally sharing office gossip.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      nuance: The 「んだって」 at the end of the sentence indicates that the information is hearsay, informally
        relayed by the speaker who heard it from someone else.
    - english: I heard we have a test now.
      japanese:
        - 今 から テスト な ん {だ って}。
        - 今 から テスト な ん {だ って} よ。
        - 今 から テスト な ん {だ って} ね。
      english_literally: From now test, I heard.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 今 から テスト だ {そう だ}。
          english: I heard we have a test now.
          hint: 「そうだ」 indicates hearsay. We're looking for an even more informal and direct way to convey
            information heard, often used in rapid, peer-to-peer communication.
      scene: A student relaying last-minute information to a classmate.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      nuance: The phrase 「なんだって」 is a very casual way to report something heard from another source, often
        used among peers in school or informal settings. It suggests the information was received recently
        or as a quick update.
    - english: I heard the president approved the new project.
      japanese:
        - 社長 が 新しい 企画 を 承認 し た {だ って} よ。
        - 社長 が 新しい 企画 を 承認 し た ん {だ って} よ。
        - 社長 が 新しい 企画 を 承認 し た {だ って}。
      english_literally: President new project approved, I heard.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 社長 が 新しい 企画 を 承認 し た {そう だ} よ。
          english: I heard the president approved the new project.
          hint: 「そうだ」 implies hearsay, but 「だってよ」 is used to casually and excitedly relay news or information
            that the speaker has just learned, with a slight emphasis.
      scene: Employees excitedly sharing news they overheard from management.
      register: casual
      setting: excited
      nuance: The combination of 「だって」 with the sentence-final particle 「よ」 adds a sense of informing the
        listener about something important or noteworthy that the speaker has just heard. It conveys a casual,
        slightly emphatic relay of news.
    - english: It's because I'm bad at kanji.
      japanese:
        - '{だ って}、私 は 漢字 が 苦手 な ん だ もん。'

      english_literally: Because, I kanji bad at.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 私 は 漢字 が 苦手 だ {から}。
          english: It's because I'm bad at kanji.
          hint: While 「から」 states a neutral reason, 「だって」 combined with 「もん」 adds a softer, more personal,
            or slightly defensive nuance to the excuse, often used by female speakers.
      scene: A high school girl giving an excuse for not being able to read something.
      register: casual
      setting: apologetic
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: The use of 「もん」 (a casual variant of 「もの」) at the end of the sentence adds a feminine or childish
        nuance, making the excuse sound softer and more personal. The phrase 「苦手 なんだ」 emphasizes the speaker's
        personal difficulty.
    - english: I'm going home early today. It's because I have plans.
      japanese:
        - 今日 は 早く 帰る よ。{だ って}、約束 が ある もの。
        - 今日 は 早く 帰る よ。{だ って}、約束 が ある から。
      english_literally: Today early go home. Because, promise exists.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 今日 は 早く 帰る よ。約束 が ある {から}。
          english: I'm going home early today. It's because I have plans.
          hint: 「から」 is a standard way to give a reason. However, 「だって」 combined with 「もの」 softens the reason
            and makes it sound more like a personal justification rather than a neutral statement.
      scene: A coworker informing their colleague they're leaving early.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: informative
      nuance: The sentence ends with 「もの」, which is a soft, explanatory particle, often used when giving
        a reason or excuse. This makes the statement sound more personal and less abrupt than a simple declarative
        sentence.
    - english: Even he makes mistakes sometimes.
      japanese:
        - 彼 {だ って} 時々 間違い を する よ。
        - 彼 {だ って} 時々 間違い を する。

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 {で も} 時々 間違い を する よ。
          english: Even he makes mistakes sometimes.
          hint: While 「でも」 can mean 'even', 「だって」 emphasizes the surprising inclusion of 'him' (who is usually
            perfect) among those who make mistakes, adding a nuanced sense of unexpectedness.
      scene: Someone pointing out that even a usually perfect person has flaws.
      register: casual
      setting: serious
      nuance: 「彼 だって」 emphasizes that *even* a person typically considered flawless is subject to making
        mistakes, highlighting a universal truth. The 「よ」 at the end confirms this understanding to the
        listener.
    - english: The reason I was late is because I had to do my homework.
      japanese:
        - 遅れ た の は、{だ って} 宿題 を やら なきゃ いけ なかっ た から だ。

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 遅れ た の は、宿題 を やら なきゃ いけ なかっ た {から} だ。
          english: The reason I was late is because I had to do my homework.
          hint: 「から」 simply states a reason. 「だって」, when used to introduce a reason, often carries a slight
            defensive or self-evident tone, making it more personal than a neutral explanation.
      scene: A student explaining their tardiness to a teacher.
      register: casual
      setting: apologetic
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The construction 「〜やらなきゃ いけなかった」 means 'had to do', expressing a strong obligation. The use
        of 「だって」 at the beginning of the reason clause here suggests a slight defensiveness or an explanation
        that the speaker feels is self-evident.
    - english: I'm kind to you because I like you.
      japanese:
        - 君 に 優しい の は、{だ って} 君 が 好き だ から さ。

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 君 に 優しい の は、君 が 好き だ {から} さ。
          english: I'm kind to you because I like you.
          hint: While 「から」 provides the reason, 「だって」 introduces it with a more emotional or personal emphasis,
            which fits the flirty tone better than a simple factual statement.
      scene: A young man subtly flirting with someone he's attracted to.
      register: casual
      setting: flirty
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The sentence ends with 「さ」, a casual particle often used by male speakers to add emphasis
        or a sense of shared understanding. The use of 「君 が 好き だ から」 directly states the affectionate reason
        for his kindness.
    - english: This movie is definitely going to be interesting!
      japanese:
        - この 映画 は、{だ って} 絶対 面白い ん だ もん！

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - この 映画 は、絶対 面白い {から}！
          english: This movie is definitely going to be interesting!
          hint: 「から」 states a reason. 「だって」 combined with 「んだもん」 adds a strong emotional conviction and
            personal belief to the reason, often used by female speakers for emphatic explanations.
      scene: A teenager enthusiastically trying to convince a friend to watch a movie.
      register: casual
      setting: excited
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The use of 「絶対」 (zettai) means 'definitely', expressing strong certainty. The phrase 「ん だもん」
        at the end, particularly with 「もん」, adds an emotional, perhaps slightly childish, conviction to
        the statement, often used by female speakers.
    - english: But I wouldn't know anything like that.
      japanese:
        - '{だ って}、そんな こと 私 に は わから ない よ。'
        - '{だ って}、そんな こと 私 に は わから ない。'
      english_literally: But, that kind of thing for me don't understand.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - そんな こと 私 に は わから ない {から}。
          english: I wouldn't know anything like that.
          hint: 「から」 provides a neutral reason. 「だって」 introduces a reason or excuse with a slightly defensive
            or resigned tone, emphasizing a personal inability or lack of knowledge.
      scene: Someone confronted with an unexpected question, feeling a bit overwhelmed or unprepared.
      register: casual
      setting: apologetic
      nuance: Starting with 「だって」 here introduces a reason or an excuse in a slightly defensive or resigned
        tone. 「私 に は わからない」 highlights the speaker's personal inability to know or understand, often used
        when feeling unprepared or overwhelmed.
  post_example_writeup: 'When using だって, remember the nuance it conveys: a reason, often with a touch of
    defensiveness or childlike explanation. Consider the context and your relationship with the listener
    to ensure the message is conveyed appropriately.'
