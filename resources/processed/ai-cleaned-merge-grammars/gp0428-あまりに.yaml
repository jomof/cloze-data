    "etymology": "Derived from 余る (amaru), meaning \"to remain\" or \"to be in excess.\" あまりに (amari ni) thus conveys the sense of something exceeding a normal or acceptable limit.",
    "writeup": "**あまりに (amari ni)** is used to express that something is \"too much\" or \"excessive,\" leading to a particular result. It often conveys surprise or shock at the degree of something. Think of it as indicating that something is so (A) that (B) happened. It's an adverbial form, so it modifies the verb or adjective in the sentence to add the nuance of excessiveness. あんまり is a colloquial version of あまり, but it is not appropriate for professional situations.",
