        "function": "Indicates an excessive degree or quantity of something, leading to a specific, often surprising or undesirable, outcome.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the degree of something is beyond expectation or a normal limit, prompting a reaction or consequence. It often carries a sense of surprise or shock at the intensity or quantity.",

    "etymology": "Derived from 余る (amaru), meaning \"to remain\" or \"to be in excess.\" あまりに (amari ni) thus conveys the sense of something exceeding a normal or acceptable limit.",
    "writeup": "**あまりに (amari ni)** is an adverbial expression used to convey that something is \"too much\" or \"excessive,\" which then leads to a particular result. It is frequently employed when expressing surprise or shock regarding the intensity or degree of something. While it can be translated simply as \"so much (A) that (B)\" or \"way too much (A),\" its core meaning is closer to \"excessively.\" Therefore, thinking of it as \"it is excessively (A), so (B)\" can often capture its full nuance.\n\nThis grammar point can modify verbs and adjectives directly, or nouns when followed by の or にも. The inclusion of も (forming **あまりにも**), while optional, adds further emphasis to the \"excess\" of the preceding element, highlighting an even more pronounced or extreme outcome.\n\nIt is important to note that あんまり (anmari) is a colloquial variant of あまり. While commonly used in spoken Japanese, it should generally be avoided in formal or official writing due to its informal nature.",
