    "etymology": "The grammar point 『を問わず』 originates from the verb 『問う (とう)』, meaning 'to inquire' or 'to question', combined with 『ず』, an archaic negative auxiliary verb that functions similarly to 『ない』 (not). Therefore, its literal meaning is 'without questioning' or 'without asking'. Over time, this evolved into its current usage to express 'regardless of' or 'without distinction', reflecting the idea that the given factor is not even considered or questioned.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「{を問わず}」 is a formal and often used expression that means \"regardless of,\" \"irrespective of,\" \"whether or not,\" or \"no matter what.\" It emphasizes that a certain condition or factor does not influence the outcome or the applicability of a statement.\n\nThis expression is formed from the verb 「問う (とう)」 (to ask, to question) and the classical negative auxiliary verb 「ず」 (which functions similarly to modern 「ない」). Thus, its literal interpretation is \"without questioning\" or \"without asking.\" This implies that the factor marked by 「を」 is not taken into consideration.\n\n「{を問わず}」 is primarily used in formal settings, such as public announcements, official documents, regulations, advertisements, and business contexts. It conveys a strong sense of universality, impartiality, or comprehensive applicability.\n\nWhile typically found after nouns or noun phrases, it can also follow clauses ending with 「か」 or 「かどうか」, forming phrases like 「〜かどう{かを問わず}」 (regardless of whether ~ or not).\n\n**Usage Notes:**\n*   **Particle 「を」**: The particle 「を」 indicates the object of the verb 「問う」, which is the condition or factor being disregarded.\n*   **「は」 vs. 「を」**: Occasionally, 「は」 may replace 「を」 (e.g., 「〜は問わず」). This subtle shift can add a nuance of contrast or stronger emphasis on the disregarded element.\n*   **Scope vs. Concession**: While often translated as \"regardless of,\" it can sometimes carry a nuance closer to \"in any case for (A), (B),\" especially when (A) defines a scope. This distinguishes it from other \"regardless\" expressions that might imply a concession despite an obstacle. For example, 「昼夜{を問わず}」 means \"whether it's day or night, [activity continues],\" emphasizing continuous activity across that scope, rather than overcoming a difficulty of it being night or day.",
