        "Context/Situation + それでは": "Indicates a transition or conclusion based on the preceding context. Expresses 'if that's the case,' 'then,' or 'well then.'"

        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",

    "etymology": "「それでは」 is derived from 「それ」 (that) + the particle 「で」 (indicating means or cause) + the topic marker 「は」 (wa). It literally means \"with that being the case\" or \"given that,\" which evolved into its current usage as a transitional phrase.",
    "writeup": "「それでは」 is a highly versatile conjunction used to introduce a logical transition, a conclusion drawn from a prior statement, or to signal a shift in topic. It encompasses meanings such as \"if that's the case,\" \"then,\" or \"well then.\" While it can be used across various politeness levels, it is most commonly found in **semi-formal** and **formal** contexts, maintaining a polite and structured tone. In more casual speech, it frequently contracts to 「それじゃ」 or 「それじゃあ」. This phrase often appears at the beginning of a sentence, serving as a clear indicator that the speaker is moving on to a consequence, a new proposal, or simply a polite departure.",

It's suitable for semi-formal to formal contexts. 「それなら」, on the other hand, carries a stronger conditional meaning, implying \"if *that* is the case, then...\" It's used when a direct consequence or alternative action is proposed based specifically on the preceding statement. Lastly, 「じゃあ」 is the casual contraction of 「それでは」, often used in informal settings for quick transitions or conclusions, but it lacks the politeness and formality of its longer counterparts.",
