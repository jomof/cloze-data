    "etymology": "「それでは」 is derived from 「それ」 (that) + the particle 「で」 (indicating means or cause) + the topic marker 「は」 (wa). It literally means \"with that being the case\" or \"given that,\" which evolved into its current usage as a transitional phrase.",
    "writeup": "「それでは」 is a versatile conjunction used to indicate a transition or a conclusion based on the preceding context. It conveys meanings such as \"if that's the case,\" \"then,\" or \"well then.\" Primarily used in **formal** and **semi-formal** contexts, it serves to gracefully shift topics or introduce consequences of previous statements. In more casual settings, it is often contracted to 「それじゃ」 or 「それじゃあ」. It is frequently found at the beginning of a sentence to signal a logical progression or a new course of action.",
