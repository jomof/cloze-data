        "Context/Situation + それでは": "Indicates a transition or conclusion based on the preceding context. Expresses 'if that's the case,' 'then,' or 'well then.'"

    "meaning": "If that's the case; then; well then",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Generally formal, but can be used in semi-formal situations. In casual speech, it's often contracted to それじゃ or それじゃあ.",
        "Function": "To indicate a shift in topic, a conclusion based on prior information, or to suggest a course of action.",
        "Usage": "Commonly used at the beginning of a sentence or phrase to signal a transition or to introduce a consequence of something previously stated."
    },
    "etymology": "「それでは」 is derived from 「それ」 (that) + the particle 「で」 (indicating means or cause) + the topic marker 「は」 (wa). It literally means \"with that being the case\" or \"given that,\" which evolved into its current usage as a transitional phrase.",
    "writeup": "「それでは」 is a versatile conjunction used to indicate a transition or a conclusion based on the preceding context. It conveys meanings such as \"if that's the case,\" \"then,\" or \"well then.\" While generally considered formal, it can be used in semi-formal situations as well. In more casual settings, it's often shortened to 「それじゃ」 or 「それじゃあ」. It's frequently used at the beginning of a sentence to signal a shift in topic or to introduce a consequence.",
