        "function": "Used to emphasize that something is nothing special, unremarkable, or is simply an ordinary example.",
        "nuance": "Implies that something is *merely* or *only* a certain thing, suggesting it holds no particular importance, special quality, or hidden meaning. It can be used to downplay or dismiss.",
        "colocation": "Often appears with nouns describing people (e.g., 学生, 会社員, 主婦), objects (e.g., 水, 石), or abstract concepts (e.g., 冗談, 偶然).",

    },
    "etymology": "The term 「ただ」 (tada) originally meant 'free' or 'gratis' (e.g., in 「無料」, muryō, or 「ただ飯」, tadameshi, a free meal). Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass 'ordinary' or 'common', signifying something that is not special or costly. The addition of the particle 「の」 (no) functions as a genitive particle, making 「ただの」 a direct modifier for nouns, similar to 'of ordinary' or 'a mere' in English, reinforcing the idea of plainness or lack of extraordinary qualities.",
    "writeup": "「ただの」 is a grammatical construct used to emphasize that something is **nothing special**, **merely ordinary**, or \"just\" something. It functions as a pre-noun modifier, directly preceding the noun it describes. This expression is particularly useful when you want to downplay the significance of something or clarify that it lacks any extraordinary or hidden qualities. It's akin to saying \"just a\" or \"only a\" in English, often conveying a sense of disappointment, reassurance, or dismissiveness.\n\nIt is frequently used in everyday speech and informal contexts, but can appear in more formal settings when the speaker wishes to explicitly state the plainness or lack of distinction of a subject. The nuance of 「ただの」 is stronger than simply stating a fact; it deliberately highlights the 'unremarkable' aspect.",
