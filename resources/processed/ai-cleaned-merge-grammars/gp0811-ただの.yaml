    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "casual",
        "function": "Used to emphasize that something is nothing special, unremarkable, or is simply an ordinary example.",
        "nuance": "Implies that something is *merely* or *only* a certain thing, suggesting it holds no particular importance, special quality, or hidden meaning. It can be used to downplay or dismiss.",
        "colocation": "Often appears with nouns describing people (e.g., 学生, 会社員, 主婦), objects (e.g., 水, 石), or abstract concepts (e.g., 冗談, 偶然).",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as an adjectival modifier, directly preceding the noun it modifies."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「ただ」 (tada) originally meant 'free' or 'gratis' (e.g., in 「無料」, muryō, or 「ただ飯」, tadameshi, a free meal). Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass 'ordinary' or 'common', signifying something that is not special or costly. The addition of the particle 「の」 (no) functions as a genitive particle, making 「ただの」 a direct modifier for nouns, similar to 'of ordinary' or 'a mere' in English, reinforcing the idea of plainness or lack of extraordinary qualities.",
    "writeup": "「ただの」 is a grammatical construct used to emphasize that something is **nothing special**, **merely ordinary**, or \"just\" something. It functions as a pre-noun modifier, directly preceding the noun it describes. This expression is particularly useful when you want to downplay the significance of something or clarify that it lacks any extraordinary or hidden qualities. It's akin to saying \"just a\" or \"only a\" in English, often conveying a sense of disappointment, reassurance, or dismissiveness.\n\nIt is frequently used in everyday speech and informal contexts, but can appear in more formal settings when the speaker wishes to explicitly state the plainness or lack of distinction of a subject. The nuance of 「ただの」 is stronger than simply stating a fact; it deliberately highlights the 'unremarkable' aspect.",

            "meaning": "Simple, mere, plain.",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both convey a sense of simplicity or ordinariness, 「単なる」 (tan naru) is generally considered a more formal and slightly stronger synonym, often used in written contexts or to emphasize a definitive lack of complexity or depth. It often sounds more objective."

            "term": "普通の",
            "meaning": "Normal, ordinary, usual.",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「普通の」 (futsū no) simply describes something as ordinary in a general, neutral sense without the added nuance of dismissing or downplaying. 「ただの」 implies that something is *merely* ordinary and nothing more, often conveying a subjective judgment of insignificance."

            "term": "に過ぎない",
            "meaning": "nothing more than; merely; just; only",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「に過ぎない」 (ni suginai) is a more emphatic and often critical expression, stating that something is *nothing more* than a certain thing, implying it's insufficient, trivial, or fails to meet expectations. It's a sentence-ending expression rather than a noun modifier like 「ただの」."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ただの」, 「単なる」, 「普通の」, and 「に過ぎない」 all relate to the idea of something being ordinary or simple, their nuances differ significantly. 「ただの」 emphasizes the *mere* or *only* aspect, often in a subjective, dismissive, or humble way. 「単なる」 is a more formal and objective way to state something is simple or just what it appears to be. 「普通の」 is a neutral descriptor of normalcy. 「に過ぎない」 is a strong, often negative, assertion that something is *nothing more* than a given quality, implying a lack of significance or impact.",
