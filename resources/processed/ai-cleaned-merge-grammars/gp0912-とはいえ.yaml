    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とはいえ」 comes from 「とは言う」 (to say that) + 「いえ」 (though/although). The 「は」 here is a topic marker, emphasizing the preceding statement, while 「いえ」 indicates a concession or contrast. Thus, the phrase acknowledges a statement but introduces a contrasting idea.",
    "writeup": "「とはいえ」 is a formal Japanese grammar pattern used to acknowledge a previous statement or fact, while introducing a contrasting or qualifying point. It conveys a sense of \"although (A) is true, (B) is also true\" or \"be that as it may.\" It is similar to saying, \"I admit that... but...\" or \"having said that...\"",
