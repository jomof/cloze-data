        "[Sentence plain form] + とはいえ": "Acknowledges a preceding statement or fact, then introduces a contrasting or qualifying point.",
        "[Noun/Na-adjective + (だ)] + とはいえ": "For nouns and na-adjectives, the optional だ can be omitted, especially in more formal or literary contexts. However, the plain form is technically the base."

    "meaning": "Though, although (I admit that), be that as it may, nonetheless",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used in formal or stiff contexts. Often appears in writing or serious discourse, acknowledging a fact before presenting a strong counterpoint."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とはいえ」 comes from 「とは言う」 (to say that) + 「いえ」 (imperative form of 言う, meaning 'though' or 'although'). The 「は」 here is a topic marker, emphasizing the preceding statement, while 「いえ」 indicates a concession or contrast. Thus, the phrase acknowledges a statement but introduces a contrasting idea. It literally means something like 'even if one were to say that...'.",
    "writeup": "「とはいえ」 is a sophisticated Japanese grammar pattern employed to acknowledge a previous statement or fact, while simultaneously introducing a contrasting or qualifying point. It serves to convey a sense of 'although (A) is true, (B) is also true' or 'be that as it may.' Think of it as saying, 'I concede that point, but...' or 'Having said that, consider this...'.\n\nThis structure frequently appears in formal settings, such as academic papers, official speeches, or serious discussions. It's often used when the speaker or writer wishes to present a balanced view, or to gently counter a previously stated fact without directly refuting it. The first clause (A) typically presents a fact or commonly held belief, while the second clause (B) introduces a counterpoint, a limitation, or a different perspective that doesn't negate A but adds important context.\n\nThe phrase technically derives from `〜と` (quotative particle) + `は` (topic/contrastive particle) + `言え` (imperative of 言う 'to say'). This literal breakdown emphasizes the acknowledgment of the preceding statement. As such, it can attach to the plain form of verbs, adjectives, and even nouns (with or without `だ`), making it highly versatile for connecting clauses.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene sets a formal academic context where 'とはいえ' is more fitting than '〜ですが' which is generally less formal or conveys a softer contrast. The formality of the setting emphasizes the sophisticated nature of the student's knowledge rather than just a simple contrast."
