    "writeup": "The particle 「まで」 inherently signifies a **limit** or **extent**. While commonly associated with the meaning \"until,\" it is also employed to convey the nuance of **\"even\"** or **\"to the extent of\"**. This application highlights that an action or state reaches an unexpected, surprising, or extreme boundary. It is attached to nouns or the plain form of verbs. This core concept of delineating a limit underlies both its temporal (\"until\") and its emphatic (\"even\") uses. For instance, 「夜中まで勉強する」 (to study until midnight) and 「大嫌いなバナナまで食べた」 (I even ate a banana I hate) both express reaching a boundary—a temporal one in the former, and an unexpected, surprising one in the latter. When combined with other particles, such as 「も」 (e.g., 「までも」), the emphasis on the surprising or extreme nature can be further intensified.",
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「まで」 is not definitively known, but it is believed to be related to the verb 「待つ」 (matsu, to wait), suggesting the idea of waiting until a certain point or reaching a certain limit.",
