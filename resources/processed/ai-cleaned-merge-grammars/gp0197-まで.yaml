    "etymology": "The particle まで originally indicated a physical or temporal limit. Its use expanded to include the meaning of \"even\" by extending the idea of a limit to an unexpected or surprising degree.",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle まで highlights the importance of what comes after it. Unlike its use to mean \"until,\" this usage carries the nuance of \"even\" or \"to the extent.\" It can follow verbs or nouns. まで always implies '(A)まで, (B)', where (A) is the limit/extent, and (B) is the noteworthy factor, typically a verb, adjective, or explanation.\n\nThe particle も is sometimes used with まで to emphasize the surprising nature of the event or the satisfying result.",
