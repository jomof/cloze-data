    "etymology": "The etymology of 「まで」 is not definitively known, but it is believed to be related to the verb 「待つ」 (matsu, to wait), suggesting the idea of waiting until a certain point or reaching a certain limit.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「まで」 inherently signifies a **limit** or **extent**. While commonly associated with the meaning \"until,\" it is also employed to convey the nuance of **\"even\"** or **\"to the extent of\"**. This application highlights that an action or state reaches an unexpected, surprising, or extreme boundary. It is attached to nouns or the plain form of verbs. This core concept of delineating a limit underlies both its temporal (\"until\") and its emphatic (\"even\") uses. For instance, 「夜中 まで 勉強 する」 (to study until midnight) and 「大嫌い な バナナ まで 食べた」 (I even ate a banana I hate) both express reaching a boundary—a temporal one in the former, and an unexpected, surprising one in the latter. When combined with other particles, such as 「も」 (e.g., 「までも」), the emphasis on the surprising or extreme nature can be further intensified.",

In contrast, 「まで」 emphasizes an **extreme** or **unexpected** limit or boundary that has been reached, often implying a surprising degree or extent."

It suggests a reasonable estimation. 「まで」, on the other hand, highlights the **ultimate limit** or **unforeseen extent** of something, carrying a stronger emphasis of surprise or extremity."

            "nuance": "「～ても」 expresses concession (\"even if X, Y happens\"). 「まで」 in the 「～まで(も)」 form expresses an extreme or surprising extent (\"even to the extent that X happens, Y happens\"). While both can convey a surprising element, 「まで」 specifically highlights the boundary crossed."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between these expressions, consider the specific nuance you wish to convey. If the focus is on a surprising extreme or an unexpected boundary, 「まで」 is often the most suitable choice. If you are indicating a minimal threshold, 「さえ」 may be appropriate. For simple degrees or comparisons, 「ほど」 or 「くらい」 are used. For the manner or degree of an action, 「～に」 can be used. And while 「～ても」 expresses concession, 「まで」 highlights crossing a specific, often extreme, boundary.",
