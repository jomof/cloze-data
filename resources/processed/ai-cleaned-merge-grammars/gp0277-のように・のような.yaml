    "etymology": "「よう」 comes from 「様」 (sama), meaning 'manner' or 'way'. The particle 「の」 is required to connect a noun to 「よう」 when it modifies another noun. The 「に」 form functions as an adverb, while the 「な」 form functions as an adjective.",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb **ようだ** is used for making observations and comparisons. It expresses that something is \"in the manner/way of (A).\" It requires 「の」 before these constructions when describing a noun.\n\nBecause **よう** (coming from the kanji 「様」) expresses the 'manner' in which something exists or happens, it's regularly used when the speaker has direct personal experience from which they are drawing a comparison. This means that **よう** sounds more confident than 「みたい」 or 「そう」.\n\nWhen **ようだ** describes another word (in its **ような** or **ように** form), this presents an example (例示 in Japanese), meaning that (A) is an example of (B).",
