    "etymology": "よう (様) means 'manner' or 'way.' The particle の connects it to the preceding noun. に makes it function as an adverb, while な makes it function as an adjective.",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb 「ようだ」 is used for making observations, indicating something is 'in the manner/way of' something else. Like the auxiliary verb 「そうだ」, 「ようだ」 can act similarly to a な-adjective, taking な when modifying a noun and に when acting as an adverb.  「の」 is required before these constructions when describing a noun.\n\n「よう」 (from 様) expresses the 'manner' in which something exists or happens, often used when the speaker has direct personal experience from which they draw a comparison. This makes 「よう」 sound more confident than 「みたい」 or 「そう」.\n\nWhen 「ようだ」 describes another word (in its 「ような」 or 「ように」 form), it presents an example (例示), meaning '(A) is an example of (B)'.",
