        "な-adjective stem + この上ない": "Expresses an extreme degree of the adjective, often with a strong personal or emotional tone (e.g., 迷惑この上ない).",
        "い-adjective (plain form) + ことこの上ない": "Emphasizes an extreme degree of the adjective, often for subjective feelings (e.g., 嬉しいことこの上ない).",

    "meaning": "Extremely; utterly; cannot be more; utmost",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Indicates that something is in an extreme state or condition. Often used to express strong emotions or opinions, suggesting that nothing could surpass it.",
        "nuance": "This phrase carries a strong sense of unsurpassability, meaning 'there is nothing above this.' It is predominantly used in formal writing and speech, lending a serious or emphatic tone to the expression. While it can be used with both positive and negative adjectives, it often highlights the peak of a particular state or feeling."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「この上ない」 literally translates to \"nothing above this.\" It combines 「この」 (this), 「上」 (above, top), and 「ない」 (there is not/is not). This literal meaning perfectly encapsulates its function: indicating that a quality or state has reached its absolute pinnacle, with no higher degree possible.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「この上ない」 is used to convey that something is in an **extreme state** or condition. It implies that the quality or feeling described has reached its absolute peak, and nothing could possibly surpass it. It is a powerful expression often employed to articulate strong emotions, definitive opinions, or to underscore the profound significance of a particular situation or characteristic. \n\nThis grammar point is primarily found in **formal writing and formal speech**, making it unsuitable for casual conversation. Its use elevates the register of communication, conveying a sense of seriousness and emphasis. It can attach to both い-adjectives and な-adjectives, as well as nouns.\n\nWhen used with い-adjectives, the plain form of the adjective is followed by 「ことこの上ない」. For instance, 「嬉しいことこの上ない」 translates to \"I couldn't be happier,\" emphasizing the profound depth of happiness. な-adjectives can attach directly to 「この上ない」 (e.g., 「迷惑この上ない」 - \"extremely annoying\"), or follow the pattern 「な + ことこの上ない」 (e.g., 「困難なことこの上ない」 - \"extremely difficult\"), with the latter often providing an even stronger emphasis or being used with adjectives that describe more inherent qualities. When modifying nouns, 「この上ない」 directly precedes the noun, such as 「この上ない幸せ」 (\"utmost happiness\").",
