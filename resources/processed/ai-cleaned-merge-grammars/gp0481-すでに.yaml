    "etymology": "The word 「すでに (sudeni)」 originally comes from the verb 「過ぐ (sugu)」, meaning \"to pass\" or \"to exceed\". Over time, it evolved to mean \"already\" or \"previously\", implying that a certain point in time has already passed, highlighting the finality of the state or action.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「すでに」 serves as a formal alternative to 「もう」, both conveying the meaning of \"already\". However, 「すでに」 carries deeper nuances beyond simple completion, often implying that a situation is unchangeable or that it is, indeed, too late to alter it. It conveys a strong sense of finality and absolute completion.\n\nConsider the multifaceted meaning of 「すでに」 through these underlying nuances:\n\n*   **のこらず (nokorazu)**: Implies \"nothing remaining\" or \"completely\". The state is fully established with nothing left to be done or changed.\n*   **あまねく (amaneku)**: Suggests \"all around\" or \"universally\". The condition is widespread or applies to everything.\n*   **ことごとく (kotogotoku)**: Means \"altogether\" or \"entirely\". Everything related to the matter is encompassed.\n*   **もはや (mohaya)**: Reinforces \"already\" with a sense of \"by now\" or \"no longer\". It often emphasizes a point of no return.\n*   **まぎれもなく (magiremonaku)**: Signifies \"beyond doubt\" or \"unmistakably\". The situation is unequivocally confirmed.\n\nThese seemingly disparate nuances collectively reveal the core meaning of 「すでに」: a state of complete and immutable establishment. It is precisely this implication of unchangeability that leads to its frequent use in contexts where something is \"too late\", signifying that no further action can be taken or that the outcome is irreversible.",

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between 「すでに」 and 「もう」, consider the level of formality and the nuance you wish to convey. 「すでに」 is appropriate for formal situations or when you want to emphasize that something is a definitive, unchangeable fact. 「もう」 is suitable for everyday conversations and has broader applications, including expressing \"no longer\" or \"anymore\" in negative contexts.",
