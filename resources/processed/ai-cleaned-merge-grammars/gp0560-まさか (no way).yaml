  part-of-speech: adverb
  usage-context: Used to express strong disbelief, surprise, or the conviction that something is impossible
    or highly unlikely.
  function: Expresses strong disbelief, surprise, or unexpectedness.
  nuance: Carries a sense of astonishment or a strong conviction that something is unlikely or impossible.
  temporal-flow: Often sets a tone for a statement about an unexpected past, present, or future event,
    implying the speaker's prior disbelief or current shock.
  spatial-flow: Not directly applicable, but can relate to an unexpected encounter in a specific place
    as seen in examples.
etymology: 「まさか」 is derived from 「まさ」, an older noun meaning "precise" or "exact," combined with the adverbial
  particle 「か」, which indicates a question or doubt. The literal sense is akin to "Is it actually true?"
  Over time, its meaning evolved to express strong disbelief or unexpectedness, rather than a literal
  question of truth.
writeup: |-
  「まさか」 is an adverb expressing intense disbelief, surprise, or a strong conviction that something is impossible. It is almost always written purely in hiragana, despite its etymological roots in kanji. While its literal origins hint at a question of truth, in modern Japanese, 「まさか」 functions as a single adverb conveying sentiments such as "no way," "I can't believe it," or "don't tell me."

  As an adverb, 「まさか」 most commonly appears at the beginning of a sentence, setting the tone for the speaker's shock or astonishment about what follows. It can be used both to express personal surprise about an unexpected event or to refute a claim with strong incredulity.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   **Placement:** Typically precedes the statement of disbelief. For example, 「まさか、彼がそんなことをするなんて」 (No way, he would do such a thing!).
  *   **Associated Phrases:** It often pairs with expressions of thought or certainty, such as 「〜とは思わなかった」 (I didn't think that...) or 「〜はずがない」 (There's no way that...) or 「〜わけがない」 (There's no reason/way that!).

  - term: よもや
    meaning: surely not, never imagine
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「よもや」 is a more formal and literary expression that suggests an even greater degree of unlikelihood
      or impossibility than 「まさか」. It is almost always followed by a negative phrase, implying that something
      surely won't happen. While 「まさか」 expresses personal shock or disbelief, 「よもや」 often implies a more
      detached prediction of extreme improbability.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:よもや (surely not)
  - term: ありえない
    meaning: impossible, no way, unbelievable
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ありえない」 is a direct and often forceful declaration of factual impossibility. It means something
      cannot happen or does not exist, based on objective reality or logic. In contrast, 「まさか」 conveys
      a subjective sense of personal disbelief or astonishment at an event, rather than a factual statement
      about its impossibility.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ありえない (impossible)
  - term: 信じられない
    meaning: unbelievable, incredible
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「信じられない」 expresses the speaker's personal inability to accept or process a surprising or shocking
      fact. It is a direct statement about one's own mental state. While 「まさか」 often acts as an initial
      exclamation of disbelief or rhetorical question about an unthinkable idea, 「信じられない」 describes the
      feeling of disbelief after a fact or event has been presented.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:信じられない (unbelievable)
  - term: はずがない
    meaning: there's no way; it's impossible
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はずがない」 denotes a strong conviction that something is logically or objectively impossible,
      given known facts, rules, or common sense. It speaks to a certain truth or expectation. 「まさか」, on
      the other hand, expresses a subjective, emotional shock or incredulity at something unexpected,
      rather than a reasoned impossibility.
    grammar_point: はずがない (logical impossibility)
  - term: わけがない
    meaning: no way; impossible
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Like 「はずがない」, 「わけがない」 asserts an objective impossibility, often derived from the inherent
      nature of things or prevailing circumstances. It indicates that there is no logical reason or way
      for something to be true. While 「まさか」 focuses on the speaker's startled reaction to an unbelievable
      notion, 「わけがない」 makes a more definitive statement about the unreasonableness of a situation.
    grammar_point: わけがない (no way)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「まさか」 expresses a subjective shock or disbelief, typically at the idea or
  occurrence of something unexpected. In contrast, 「ありえない」 directly states factual impossibility, while
  「信じられない」 conveys a personal inability to believe due to surprise. 「はずがない」 and 「わけがない」 denote objective
  impossibility based on logic or circumstances, often implying that something should not be true. 「よもや」
  is a more formal or literary term for strong unlikelihood, usually paired with a negative verb. While
  all these terms relate to negation or disbelief, 「まさか」 stands out for its strong, often anticipatory,
  emotional tone about something unthinkable or highly improbable.

        english: It's unbelievable that I could pass the N1 exam.
        hint: 「信じられない」 directly expresses personal incredulity. We're looking for a word that emphasizes
          the unexpectedness of achieving something difficult, often in a humble or self-deprecating way.
      - competing_japanese:
          - よもや N 1 に 合格 できる など と は 思わ なかっ た。
        english: Surely, I would not have imagined being able to pass the N1 exam.
        hint: 「よもや」 implies a very strong and somewhat formal denial of possibility. 'まさか' here captures
          a more personal, reflective sense of pleasant surprise at overcoming a perceived obstacle.
    scene: A student who found the N1 exam very challenging receives their passing results.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: In this context, 「{まさか}」 expresses humble disbelief and pleasant surprise at one's own unexpected
      achievement. It signifies that the speaker genuinely thought such a feat was beyond their capabilities.
      The phrasing 「〜なんて な」 (for male speakers) or 「〜なんて、信じられませんわ」 (for female speakers) adds to the reflective
      and sometimes slightly self-deprecating tone. This example uses 「俺」 indicating a male speaker's
      casual reflection on his success.
  - english: Don't tell me, you've decided to quit your job?
    japanese:
      - '{まさか}、会社 を 辞める なんて 言わ ない よ ね？'
      - '{まさか}、仕事 を 辞める ん じゃ ない だろ う ね？'
      - え、{まさか} 会社 辞め ちゃう の？
      - '{まさか}、まさか、会社 を お 辞め に なる わけ で は ない です よ ね？'
      - '{まさか} お前、会社 辞める と か 言わ ない よ な？'
    english_literally: No way, you're not going to say you're quitting the company, right?

      - competing_japanese:
          - 会社 を 辞める の？
        english: Are you quitting your job?
        hint: This is a direct question. We're looking for a word that adds a strong sense of disbelief
          or shock, implying a hope that the news isn't true.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会社 を 辞める なんて、信じ られ ない。
        english: It's unbelievable that you're quitting your job.
        hint: 「信じられない」 states a personal inability to believe. We're looking for a word that introduces
          a rhetorical question expressing strong hope that the shocking news is false.
      - competing_japanese:
          - まさ か と は 思う が、会社 を 辞める の か？
        english: I think it's impossible, but are you quitting your job?
        hint: This is a more direct and less emotionally charged way of asking. We're looking for a phrase
          that uses 'まさか' to express initial shock and an unspoken plea for the news to be untrue.
    scene: A friend hears a surprising rumor about another friend's career plans and confronts them.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「{まさか}」 here is used to preface a rhetorical question, expressing strong disbelief and often
      a hope that the shocking information is not true. The addition of 「〜ないよね？」 or 「〜んじゃ ない だろ う ね？」
      emphasizes seeking confirmation while implicitly wishing the answer is 'no'. For female speakers,
      「〜ないよね？」 is more typical; for male speakers, 「〜ないよな？」 is more typical. This example is tailored
      for a female speaker talking to a female listener.

      - '{まさか}、うち の 子 が 部屋 を 片付ける なんて！'

        english: It's surprising that my child cleaned their room.
        hint: This expresses simple surprise. We're looking for a word that adds a stronger nuance of
          disbelief at such an unexpected positive outcome.
      - competing_japanese:
          - うち の 子 が 部屋 を 片付け た と は 思わ なかっ た。
        english: I didn't think my child would clean their room.
        hint: This states a lack of prior expectation. We're looking for an expression that conveys intense
          disbelief and joy at the unexpected action.
    scene: A parent, accustomed to a messy room, walks in to find it spotless.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    nuance: The use of 「{まさか}」 here conveys genuine, joyful disbelief from the parent, implying that this
      is a highly rare and unexpected event. The phrase 「うちの子」 emphasizes the familiarity and the parent's
      established expectations for their child's habits.
  - english: No way, you're not seriously thinking of climbing Mount Fuji in winter, are you?
    japanese:
      - '{まさか}、冬 に 富士 山 に 登ろう と は 考え て ない だろ う ね？'
      - '{まさか}、冬 の 富士 山 登山 と か、本気 で 言っ てる？'
      - 冬 の 富士 山 に {まさか} 登る わけ ない よ ね？
      - '{まさか} 冬 の 富士 山 に 登る なんて、あり え ない よ！'
    english_literally: No way, you're not thinking of climbing Mt. Fuji in winter, right?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 冬 に 富士 山 に 登る の は 危ない よ。
        english: Climbing Mount Fuji in winter is dangerous.
        hint: This is a direct warning. We're looking for a word that expresses strong disbelief and concern
          about the sheer audacity or foolishness of the idea.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 冬 に 富士 山 に 登ろう なんて、信じ られ ない。
        english: It's unbelievable to think of climbing Mount Fuji in winter.
        hint: 「信じられない」 expresses personal incredulity. We're looking for a word that introduces a rhetorical
          question implying that the idea is too extreme to be true.
    scene: Friends are discussing extreme winter activities, and one suggests something very dangerous.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    nuance: Here, 「{まさか}」 is used to preface a rhetorical question, expressing strong disbelief and concern.
      The implied meaning is that the idea is so extreme or dangerous that the speaker hopes it's not
      being considered seriously. The use of 「〜ないだろうね？」 reinforces the speaker's desire for a negative
      answer, indicating a subtle warning or plea. This example is gender-neutral.
  - english: Surely, he won't make the same mistake again.
    japanese:
      - '{まさか} 彼 が 同じ 失敗 を 繰り返す {まい}。'
      - 彼 が 同じ 失敗 を 繰り返す {まい} と、{まさか} は 思わ ない。
      - これ だけ 経験 し て {まさか} 同じ 失敗 を 繰り返す {まい} と 信じ て いる。
      - '{まさか}、あの 彼 が また 同じ 轍 を 踏む {まい}。'
    english_literally: No way, he won't repeat the same mistake.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 同じ 失敗 を 繰り返さ ない だろう。
        english: He probably won't repeat the same mistake.
        hint: This expresses simple probability or expectation. We're looking for a stronger, more emphatic
          declaration of certainty about a negative outcome not happening, often with a literary or formal
          tone.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 同じ 失敗 を 繰り返す はず が ない。
        english: There's no way he would repeat the same mistake.
        hint: 「はずがない」 expresses objective certainty of impossibility. We're looking for a phrase that
          conveys a strong, subjective conviction or hope that something won't happen, often with a slightly
          more formal or literary feel.
      - competing_japanese:
          - よもや 彼 が 同じ 失敗 を 繰り返す など と は 思わ ない だろう。
        english: Surely, I would not think he would repeat the same mistake.
        hint: 「よもや」 emphasizes extreme unlikelihood in a formal context. While similar, 'まさか...まい' conveys
          a personal, firm belief against something happening, often used reflectively or with strong
          resolve.
    scene: A mentor expresses a strong conviction that their former student, having learned from past
      errors, will not repeat them.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The combination of 「{まさか}」 with 「まい」 creates a strong, often literary or somewhat archaic,
      expression of firm conviction that something will not happen. It carries a sense of strong belief
      or hope, often in a negative context, emphasizing the unlikelihood of a negative event occurring
      again or at all. It is less about general disbelief and more about a determined negative expectation.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate the versatility of 「まさか」. It can express surprise at unfortunate
  events (like someone doing something bad), at unexpected encounters, or at the ease of a task. It can
  also convey a sense of disbelief at good fortune or one's own unexpected success, often coupled with
  humility. When used in rhetorical questions, it carries an implied wish that the unsettling information
  is false. The addition of 「まい」 in the last example demonstrates its use in expressing a strong conviction
  that something will not happen, often with a more formal or reflective tone.
