    "etymology": "The term 「精々」 is said to have originated from the older expression 「精試」 (せいし), meaning \"to completely exhaust all of one's good faith or effort.\" While the original meaning related to exhausting one's good faith is no longer in common use, 「精々」 has retained the sense of exhausting one's capacity, power, or assumptions about something.",
    "writeup": "「精々」 (seizei) is an adverb that conveys the idea of something being \"at the limit,\" \"at most,\" or \"at best.\" It indicates that a certain point or degree is the maximum achievable, often implying that progress beyond that point is impossible due to a physical or metaphorical barrier. It can also express \"no more than,\" especially when there is no apparent barrier, but the speaker believes nothing higher (or lower) is possible. As an adverb, 「精々」 typically appears at the beginning of a sentence or the beginning of the second clause, preceding the element being described as maximal.",

            "meaning": "at the limit of; at the most extreme point; at best",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While very similar to 「精々」, 「精々のところ」 emphasizes the *point* or *aspect* at which the limit is reached, making it slightly more specific or formal than the general adverbial use of 「精々」."
        },
        {
            "term": "しか～ない",
            "meaning": "only; no more than (used with negative verb)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「しか～ない」 explicitly states \"only\" in conjunction with a negative verb, often implying a deficiency or a mere quantity. While 「精々」 can also convey \"no more than,\" it often carries an additional nuance of the speaker's assessment of a maximum limit, sometimes with a tone of resignation or dismissiveness. 「しか～ない」 is more purely about quantity."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Both 「精々」 and 「しか～ない」 can express a sense of limitation, but 「精々」 often implies a speaker's subjective assessment of a maximum, carrying nuances of disappointment or a low expectation. 「しか～ない」, on the other hand, is a more direct statement of quantity or scope with a negative verb, simply meaning \"only\" or \"no more than.\"",
