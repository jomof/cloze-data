    "writeup": "精々, meaning \"at the limit,\" is an adverb indicating that something is \"at the most (A)\" or \"at best (A).\" This implies that (A) has reached its maximum, unable to progress further due to a physical or metaphorical barrier. It often conveys \"no more than (A),\" particularly when no real barrier exists, but the speaker doubts a higher (or lower) value is possible.\n\nAs an adverb, 精々 often appears at the sentence's beginning or the start of the second clause, preceding the supposedly maximal element.\n\nEtymologically, 精々 originates from the old-fashioned word 精試, meaning \"to completely exhaust all of one's good faith.\" While 精々 retains the sense of \"completely exhausting (A),\" it now refers to exhausting one's power, mental capacity, or assumptions related to (A).",
    "etymology": "The word 精々 (seizei) is said to have come from the old-fashioned word 精試 (seishi), which meant 'to completely exhaust all of one's good faith.' In modern times, 精々 itself has kept this meaning of 'completely exhausting (A).' However, this is no longer used in reference to 'good faith,' but rather exhausting all of one's 'power', 'mental capacity', or 'power of assumption' in relation to (A).",
