    "etymology": "The grammar point derives from 「難い (katai)」, an archaic form of the い-adjective 「難しい (muzukashii)」 meaning \"difficult.\" The 「に」 is a case-marking particle, and the negative 「ない」 indicates negation, creating the meaning of \"not difficult.\"",
    "writeup": "「に難くない」 is a formal grammar pattern indicating that something is \"not difficult\" to do or understand. It utilizes 「難い」, an older, more formal variant of the い-adjective 「難しい」, which also means \"difficult.\" The structure is almost always used with verbs related to thinking or conjecture, such as 「想像 (souzou)」 \"to imagine,\" 「予想 (yosou)」 \"to predict,\" 「察する (sassuru)」 \"to infer or sense,\" 「理解 (rikai)」 \"to understand,\" and 「推測 (suisoku)」 \"to guess.\" This grammar point is predominantly found in formal writing and speech. It is described as 改まった表現 (arattamatta hyougen) in Japanese dictionaries, meaning \"reformed version.\" This implies that there is a more common, everyday way of saying it using 難しい (muzukashii).",
