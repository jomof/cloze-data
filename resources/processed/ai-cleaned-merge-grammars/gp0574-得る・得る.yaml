    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「得る(える)」 originally meant \"to obtain\" or \"to acquire.\" Its usage as a potential auxiliary verb (得る/うる) evolved from this, suggesting the gaining or acquiring of the *ability* to do something. Over time, it came to simply indicate possibility or capability.",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb 「得る (える/うる)」 derives from the Godan verb 「得る」, which fundamentally means \"to obtain\" or \"to acquire.\" When attached to the ます-stem of other verbs, it functions as an auxiliary verb. In this form, it expresses the possibility or capability of something, meaning \"(A) is achievable\" or \"one can do (A).\" For instance, while 「できる」 indicates general ability or possibility, 「得る」 focuses on a more specific or potential capability, implying that \"the possibility for (A) to occur has arisen\" or \"the ability to do (A) has been acquired\" under certain circumstances.\n\nThere are two common readings for 「得る」 in its auxiliary form: 「える」 and 「うる」. 「うる」 is a more archaic expression often seen in literature and less frequently spoken in modern everyday conversation, where 「える」 is generally preferred. However, if the preceding kana is an 'e' sound (from the 'e' column of the kana table), as in 「教える」 becoming 「教えうる」, 「うる」 tends to be the favored pronunciation.\n\nCompared to 「できる」, 「得る」 carries a more formal and literary tone. Nevertheless, certain idiomatic expressions like 「あり得る (ありうる)」 (\"possible\" or \"can exist\") and 「あり得ない (ありえない)」 (\"impossible\" or \"no way\") are frequently used even in daily conversation.",

While 「れる・られる」 also expresses ability, 「得る」 carries a distinct nuance of inherent achievability or potential capability that is not present in the more general potential form. Similarly, 「できる」 expresses general capability, while 「得る」 emphasizes a more specific, sometimes profound, possibility. Expressions like 「可能性がある」 and 「かもしれない」 state possibility or conjecture, but 「得る」 often points to a more fundamental or inherent potential. When comparing 「なることもある」 to 「得る」, the former refers to occasional occurrences, whereas the latter suggests an intrinsic possibility or a latent danger. Finally, while 「不可能だ」 states impossibility directly, 「あり得ない」 often conveys a strong emotional rejection of something as unreasonable or utterly unacceptable.",
