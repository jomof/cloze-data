        "pronunciation_warning": "うる is a relatively old form that is often seen in literature, and spoken far less frequently than える. Despite this, there is a tendency for うる to be the preferred spoken choice when the kana that appears before it is え, such as 教える becoming 教えうる, rather than 教ええる."

    "etymology": "The verb 「得る(える)」 originally meant \"to obtain\" or \"to acquire.\" Its usage as a potential auxiliary verb (得る/うる) evolved from this, suggesting the gaining or acquiring of the *ability* to do something. Over time, it came to simply indicate possibility or capability.",
    "writeup": "「得る(える/うる)」 is a る-verb that primarily means \"to gain\" or \"to acquire.\" When attached to the ます-stem of verbs, it adds a nuance of \"for (A) to be possible\" or \"to be able to (A).\" It's similar to 「できる」, but 「得る」 implies a gained possibility or the potential for something to be done.  「あり得る」 (possible) and 「あり得ない」 (impossible) are common set phrases.\n\nImportant points:\n\n*   「得る」 can be read as both 「える」 and 「うる」. 「うる」 is an older form, more common in literature and less so in everyday speech.  However, 「うる」 is often preferred when the preceding kana is 「え」, like in 「教えうる」 rather than 「教ええる」.\n*   「得る」 is more formal or bookish compared to 「できる」.",
