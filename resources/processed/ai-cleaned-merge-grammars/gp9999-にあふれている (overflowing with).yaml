meaning: overflowing with, full of, brimming with
pronunciation:
  katakana: ニアフレテイル
  romaji: ni afurete iru
formation:
  Noun に あふれている: Indicates that something is overflowing or brimming with the specified noun.
jlpt: N2
etymology: The expression combines the particle 「に」 (ni), indicating a state or location, with the verb
  「あふれる」 (afureru), meaning 'to overflow' or 'to brim.' The progressive form 「ている」 (te iru) denotes a
  continuous state or a resultant state. Thus, the phrase literally describes something being 'in a state
  of overflowing with' a certain quality or quantity.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「にあふれている」 is used to describe something that is **overflowing**, **brimming**, or **full of** a particular quality, emotion, or abstract concept. It often conveys a sense of rich abundance, where the content is so plentiful that it seems to emanate or spill out. This expression is particularly effective for conveying vivid imagery or strong emotional states.

  While it can sometimes refer to physical things (like a room overflowing with books), its most common and idiomatic use is with abstract nouns such as 笑顔 (egao - smiles), 活気 (kakki - vigor), 愛 (ai - love), 希望 (kibou - hope), or エネルギー (enerugii - energy). It suggests that the thing described is not just present, but present in a vibrant, overwhelming quantity.

  Consider the nuance: 「にあふれている」 is stronger and more evocative than simply using 「でいっぱいだ」 (de ippai da), which means 'to be full of' but lacks the 'overflowing' visual. 「にあふれている」 paints a picture of something so abundant it almost can't be contained.

  - term: でいっぱいだ (full of)
    meaning: full of, packed with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「でいっぱいだ」 also means 'full of,' it is a more neutral and descriptive term. It does not
      carry the same strong connotation of 'overflowing' or 'brimming' that 「にあふれている」 does, and can be
      used for both tangible and intangible things without the same emotional weight. We're looking for
      an expression that conveys a dynamic sense of abundance, where something is so plentiful it seems
      to spill out.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:でいっぱいだ (full of)
  - term: に富む (rich in)
    meaning: rich in, abundant in
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に富む」 suggests having a large amount or being abundant in something, often resources or qualities.
      However, it implies a stable possession rather than a dynamic, outward expression of abundance.
      It does not convey the sense of 'overflowing' or 'brimming' that 「にあふれている」 does. We're looking for
      an expression that suggests something is so plentiful it can barely be contained.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:に富む (rich in)
  - term: だらけ (full of, negative)
    meaning: full of, covered with (undesirable things)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「だらけ」 is typically used when something is full of or covered with undesirable or negative
      things (e.g., 傷だらけ - full of scratches, 泥だらけ - covered in mud). It carries a negative connotation,
      whereas 「にあふれている」 usually has a positive or intense, but not negative, connotation of abundance.
      We're looking for an expression that conveys a positive or neutral sense of abundance.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:だらけ (full of, negative)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「にあふれている」, 「でいっぱいだ」, and 「に富む」, remember that
  「にあふれている」 emphasizes an almost palpable, outward sense of overflowing abundance, often used for abstract
  qualities. 「でいっぱいだ」 is a more general and neutral term for being full, applicable to both concrete and
  abstract things. 「に富む」 indicates a stable richness or abundance, without the dynamic sense of 'overflowing.'
  Lastly, 「だらけ」 is specifically for undesirable states of being 'full of' something negative.

        english: The entire hall was full of cheers.
        hint: 「でいっぱいだ」 means 'full of', but doesn't carry the dynamic sense of 'overflowing' or the rich
          imagery of cheers bursting forth. We're looking for a word that suggests the cheers were so
          loud and pervasive they seemed to spill out.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会場 全体 は 歓声 が {たくさん あっ た}。
          - ホール 全体 は 歓声 が {沢山 あり まし た}。
        english: The entire hall had a lot of cheers.
        hint: 「たくさんあった」 means 'there were many,' which is a simple quantitative statement. We're looking
          for an expression that describes the quality and pervasive presence of the cheers, not just
          their quantity.
    scene: A large concert hall erupts in loud applause and shouts of excitement after a spectacular performance.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: excited
    nuance: The use of 「歓声にあふれていた」 emphasizes that the cheers were so loud and pervasive they seemed to
      fill and spill out of the entire venue, conveying a vibrant and overwhelming atmosphere. This phrase
      implies a dynamic and intense abundance.
    etymology: The verb 「あふれる」 means to 'overflow' or 'brim', and when combined with 「に」 and the -ている
      form, it expresses a continuous state of being filled to the point of overflowing.
  - english: His words were full of love and kindness.
    japanese:

        english: His words were full of love and kindness.
        hint: 「でいっぱいだ」 is a more neutral term for 'full of.' We're looking for an expression that suggests

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 言葉 は 愛 と 優し さ が {含ま れ て い た}。
          - 彼 の 言葉 は 愛 と 優し さ が {含ま れ て い まし た}。
        english: His words contained love and kindness.
        hint: 「含まれていた」 means 'contained' or 'included,' which is too literal and passive. We want to express
          that the words were actively brimming with these qualities.
    scene: A husband is comforting his wife who is feeling down, and his gentle voice and supportive words
      are deeply felt.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: Here, 「愛と優しさにあふれていた」 vividly portrays his words as being so saturated with love and kindness
      that these emotions seemed to radiate from them, making the listener feel deeply cared for. This
      emphasizes the profound presence of these emotions.
    etymology: The combination of the particle 「に」 with 「あふれる」 and the continuous state marker 「ている」 creates
      a sense of being 'immersed' or 'saturated' by the noun, in this case, abstract feelings.

      brightens.

      that vigor and energy are so abundant they permeate every aspect of urban life, making the city

      physical overflowing to an encompassing saturation of an environment.

      that deeply permeates the subject.

      pervasive that the room itself seemed to radiate with their creativity. It's a metaphorical 'overflow'

      'spills out' and influences the entire space.

        hint: 「でいっぱいだ」 suggests fullness but not the active 'brimming' or 'radiating' quality implied

          presence of tenderness.

          a slightly more dynamic nuance of 'overflowing' or 'brimming to the point of spilling out,'
          emphasizing the profound extent of the tenderness.
    scene: A baby cries, and its mother gently picks it up, her gaze full of warmth.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「優しさにあふれていた」 powerfully conveys that her eyes expressed an overwhelming amount of tenderness,
      suggesting it was so abundant that it seemed to well up and radiate from her gaze. This emphasizes
      the depth of her affection.
    etymology: Applying the 'overflowing' metaphor to 'eyes' is common, implying that the emotion is so
      strong it is visibly expressed through one's gaze.
