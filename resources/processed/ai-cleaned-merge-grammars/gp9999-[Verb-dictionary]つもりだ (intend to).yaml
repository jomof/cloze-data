pronunciation:
  katakana: ツモリダ
  romaji: tsumorida
formation:
  Verb-dictionary form + つもりだ: Indicates the speaker's firm intention or plan to do something.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to express the speaker's intention or plan, often with a sense of determination
    or a fixed purpose. It implies a stronger resolve than simply using 'Verb-volitional form + と思う'.
  function: Expresses intention or strong resolution.
  nuance: While 'Verb-volitional form + と思う' expresses a 'thought' or 'consideration' of doing something,
    'つもりだ' indicates a more concrete 'plan' or 'intention'. It's often used when the speaker has already
    made up their mind.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a fixed expression following a verb in its dictionary form to convey
    intentionality.
etymology: The word 「つもり」 originates from 「積もり」, the noun form of the verb 「積もる」 (tsumoru), which means
  'to pile up' or 'to accumulate'. This suggests that one's intention or plan is something that has 'piled
  up' or 'gathered' within them, representing a solid resolve rather than a fleeting thought. Historically,
  it evolved to convey a definite purpose or a fixed mind-set, distinguishing it from simpler expressions
  of desire or thought.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「つもりだ」 is used to express one's firm intention or plan to do something. It indicates that the speaker has made a decision and is resolved to carry it out. This expression carries a stronger sense of determination and a more concrete plan than simply stating a desire with 「たい」 or a casual thought with 「Verb[volitional-よう] と思う」.

  It is formed by attaching 「つもりだ」 directly after a verb in its dictionary (plain non-past) form. The 「だ」 at the end conjugates like a regular copula, changing to 「です」 for polite speech, 「だった」 for plain past, 「でした」 for polite past, and so on.

  While 「Verb[volitional-よう] と思う」 suggests 'I think I will do...', 「つもりだ」 conveys 'I intend to do...' or 'I plan to do...'. This makes 「つもりだ」 suitable for situations where you want to clearly state your resolve, whether it's a long-term goal or an immediate action.

  For example, if you say 「日本語を勉強しようと思います。」, it means 'I think I'll study Japanese.' This is a gentle statement of intent. However, if you say 「日本語を勉強するつもりです。」, it means 'I intend to study Japanese.' This expresses a firmer decision and plan.

  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う
    meaning: I think I will; I'm thinking of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「つもりだ」 expresses a firmer and more definite intention or plan. 「Verb[volitional-よう]+思う」 indicates
      a thought or consideration of doing something, which is less committed and more tentative. For example,
      「旅行に行こうと思います。」 (I'm thinking of going on a trip) versus 「旅行に行くつもりです。」 (I intend to go on a trip).
    grammar_point: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う (intend to or think I will)
  - term: '[Noun・Adjective]のつもりだ'
    meaning: To believe one is; to act as if; to consider oneself to be
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While sharing the same root word 「つもり」, this usage expresses a belief or assumption about
      one's state, identity, or action, often implying that the reality might be different. The meaning
      of 'intention' is absent. For instance, 「私は子供のつもりだ。」 (I believe I am a child, or I act like a child)
      does not mean 'I intend to be a child'. This use of 「つもり」 does not follow a plain verb form.
    grammar_point: '[Noun・Adjective]のつもりだ (believe that one is・acting as if)'
post_false_friends_writeup: It is crucial to distinguish between the two primary uses of 「つもりだ」. When
  it follows a verb in its dictionary form, it conveys a strong intention or plan. However, when it follows
  a noun or an adjective, it means to 'believe that one is' or 'act as if', often implying a discrepancy
  between perception and reality. Always check what precedes 「つもりだ」 to grasp the correct meaning. The
  intention-based 「つもりだ」 is always preceded by a plain verb form.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative

      - competing_japanese:
          - 誰 も 騙そう と 思わ なかっ た。
        english: I didn't think of deceiving anyone.
        hint: 「思わなかった」 suggests a lack of thinking about it, whereas 「つもりはなかった」 implies a specific lack
          of intention or purpose. We are looking for a statement about a specific lack of intention.
    scene: A person explaining their actions after a misunderstanding.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: The plain negative past form 「つもりはなかった」 strongly expresses a lack of prior intention. The
      「は」 particle adds emphasis, stressing 'it was not my intention to deceive anyone'.
  - english: Are you really not going to apologize to her?
    japanese:
      - 彼女 に 謝る {つもり は ない} の？
      - 彼女 に 謝る {つもり は あり ませ ん} か？

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 に 謝ら ない の？
        english: Aren't you going to apologize to her?
        hint: 「謝らないの？」 is a direct question about an action not being done. 「謝るつもりはないの？」 questions the
          intent behind that action. We're asking about the intention, not just the action.
    scene: A friend questioning another friend's stubbornness.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「つもりはないの？」 indicates a strong questioning of the listener's firm intention (or
      lack thereof). The sentence-final particle 「の？」, commonly used by female speakers, softens the question
      slightly while still conveying surprise or concern.

        english: He seems to be thinking of accepting the new job offer.
        hint: Adding 「らしい」 to 「つもりだ」 conveys that the intention is 'apparent' or 'hearsay'. 「と思っているらしい」
          suggests an apparent thought, which is less definite than an apparent intention. We're expressing
          what seems to be his clear intention.
    scene: Colleagues gossiping about a mutual acquaintance's career move.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: Here, 「つもりらしい」 combines a firm intention with an indication that this information is based
      on observation or rumor (the nuance of 「らしい」). This makes the statement less of a direct fact and
      more of a strong inference about his intent.

    scene: Reassuring a worried friend or family member.
    register: teineigo (polite)

        english: From the beginning, I was trying not to get involved in that problem.
        hint: 「関わらないようにしていました」 describes an effort to avoid involvement. 「関わるつもりはありませんでした」 states that

          intention.
    scene: A professional explaining their non-involvement in a difficult situation.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)

      intention to be involved, suitable for professional explanations. The past tense and politeness
      indicate a clear and respectful declaration of non-intent.

        hint: 「つもりなの？」 is a direct question about someone's definite plan or intention, often implying
          a sense of urgency or expectation. 「と思っているの？」 is a softer inquiry about a thought. We need a
          more pointed question about the firm plan.
    scene: A frustrated parent asking their child about their next steps after a mistake.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「つもりなの？」 is a casual but direct question about a definite plan, often used by an
      older person (e.g., parent) to a younger one (e.g., child) when seeking a concrete answer. The 「一体」
      adds a sense of exasperation, implying 'what on earth do you intend to do?'

          future.

    setting: friendly

        hint: The past form of 「つもりだ」, 「つもりだった」, indicates a past intention that did not materialize.
          「思っていた」 indicates a past thought that might not have been a firm plan. We are expressing a past
          firm intention that was thwarted.
    scene: Explaining why a planned purchase didn't happen.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「つもりだった」 clearly expresses a past intention that, for some reason, was not carried out, conveying
      a sense of disappointment or a change of plans. The casual tone is suitable for discussing personal
      setbacks.
post_example_writeup: Remember that 「つもりだ」 expresses a personal, firm intention. While it translates as
  'intend to' or 'plan to', it implies a decision has already been made in the speaker's mind. It is a
  commitment that they expect to follow through on.
