etymology: The term 「どうも」 originates from older Japanese, where 「どう」 meant 'how' or 'in what way,' and
  「も」 added emphasis. Over time, its versatility extended beyond questioning the manner of something to
  become a highly condensed, context-dependent expression for acknowledging a situation or interaction,
  evolving into its current use as a versatile substitute for full greetings, thanks, or apologies.
writeup: |-
  「どうも」 is an incredibly versatile and frequently used Japanese expression that acts as a condensed form of gratitude, apology, or greeting. Its exact meaning is almost entirely dependent on the **context, tone of voice, and accompanying non-verbal cues**. When used alone, 「どうも」 can efficiently convey:
  *   **Gratitude**: In many situations, a simple 「どうも」 can mean 'Thanks' or 'Much obliged.' It's common in casual settings, like receiving a package or a small favor. For more formality or emphasis, it's often combined with 「ありがとう」 (e.g., 「どうもありがとう」) or 「ありがとうございます」 (e.g., 「どうもありがとうございます」).
  *   **Apology**: It can also serve as a quick 'Sorry' or 'Excuse me.' This is typical for minor inconveniences, like bumping into someone or asking for attention in a shop. For more serious apologies, it precedes 「すみません」 (e.g., 「どうもすみません」) or 「申し訳ありません」.
  *   **Greeting**: 「どうも」 can function as a casual 'Hello' or 'Hi,' especially when encountering someone familiar or in brief encounters. It can also be used as a polite way to initiate conversation, similar to 'Excuse me' or 'Pardon me,' particularly when seeking attention or inquiring about something.
  This grammatical point focuses specifically on these condensed, context-dependent uses of 「どうも」. It's a testament to the Japanese language's efficiency and reliance on shared understanding and situational awareness. While highly convenient, its ambiguity means a beginner might initially struggle to discern its exact meaning without sufficient context.

post_false_friends_writeup: When 「どうも」 is used by itself, it is a highly versatile expression. Its precise
  meaning depends entirely on the context. However, when combined with words like 「ありがとう」 or 「すみません」,
  its meaning becomes specific to gratitude or apology, respectively. Understanding this contextual reliance
  is key to naturally using and interpreting 「どうも」.
