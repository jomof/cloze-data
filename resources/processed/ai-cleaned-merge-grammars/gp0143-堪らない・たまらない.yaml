        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Used to express strong emotions, sensations, or desires that are difficult to control or endure. It can be applied to both positive and negative feelings.",

    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「堪らない」 (たまらない) derives from the classical Japanese verb 「堪える」 (たえる), meaning \"to endure\" or \"to bear.\" When conjugated into its negative form, 「堪えない」 (たえない), it literally means \"cannot endure\" or \"cannot bear.\" Over time, this evolved into 「堪らない」 (たまらない), losing its original kanji for the negative auxiliary and solidifying its meaning of something being overwhelmingly strong or irresistible.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「堪らない」 (たまらない) is used to convey an intense, overwhelming feeling, sensation, or desire that the speaker finds hard to contain or resist. It implies that the emotion or physical state is so potent that it reaches an unbearable level, pushing the speaker to their limit. This grammatical construction emphasizes the sheer intensity of the experience.\n\nWhile 「堪らない」 literally translates to 'cannot endure' or 'unbearable', it can be used for both **negative** and **positive** emotions. For negative experiences, it highlights extreme discomfort, pain, or annoyance. For positive experiences, it emphasizes immense pleasure, joy, or an irresistible urge.\n\n**Formation Rules:**\n*   **Verb (て-form) + 堪らない**: This structure is used to express an overwhelming desire or an irresistible urge to perform an action. For example, 「食べたくて堪らない」 (I'm dying to eat).\n*   **い-adjective (stem) + くて + 堪らない**: This applies to い-adjectives, indicating an extreme or unbearable degree of that adjective's quality. For example, 「暑くて堪らない」 (unbearably hot).\n*   **な-adjective (stem) + で + 堪らない**: This applies to な-adjectives, also indicating an extreme or unbearable degree of that adjective's quality. For example, 「好きで堪らない」 (I love it unbearably/I can't help but love it).\n\nAlthough it literally implies 'cannot endure', 「堪らない」 often functions as an intensifier, similar to 'extremely' or 'very much', but with a stronger connotation of being overwhelmed. It is commonly heard in casual conversation, reflecting a speaker's strong emotional response.",
