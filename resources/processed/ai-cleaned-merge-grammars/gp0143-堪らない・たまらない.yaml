        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Used to express strong emotions, sensations, or desires that are difficult to control or endure. It can be applied to both positive and negative feelings.",
        "nuance": "Implies a feeling or state that is beyond one's ability to tolerate, resist, or contain, often to an overwhelming degree. It conveys a sense of intense internal pressure."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「堪らない」 (たまらない) derives from the classical Japanese verb 「堪える」 (たえる), meaning \"to endure\" or \"to bear.\" When conjugated into its negative form, 「堪えない」 (たえない), it literally means \"cannot endure\" or \"cannot bear.\" Over time, this evolved into 「堪らない」 (たまらない), losing its original kanji for the negative auxiliary and solidifying its meaning of something being overwhelmingly strong or irresistible.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「堪らない」 (たまらない) is used to convey an intense, overwhelming feeling, sensation, or desire that the speaker finds hard to contain or resist. It implies that the emotion or physical state is so potent that it reaches an unbearable level, pushing the speaker to their limit. This grammatical construction emphasizes the sheer intensity of the experience.\n\nWhile 「堪らない」 literally translates to 'cannot endure' or 'unbearable', it can be used for both **negative** and **positive** emotions. For negative experiences, it highlights extreme discomfort, pain, or annoyance. For positive experiences, it emphasizes immense pleasure, joy, or an irresistible urge.\n\n**Formation Rules:**\n*   **Verb (て-form) + 堪らない**: This structure is used to express an overwhelming desire or an irresistible urge to perform an action. For example, 「食べたくて堪らない」 (I'm dying to eat).\n*   **い-adjective (stem) + くて + 堪らない**: This applies to い-adjectives, indicating an extreme or unbearable degree of that adjective's quality. For example, 「暑くて堪らない」 (unbearably hot).\n*   **な-adjective (stem) + で + 堪らない**: This applies to な-adjectives, also indicating an extreme or unbearable degree of that adjective's quality. For example, 「好きで堪らない」 (I love it unbearably/I can't help but love it).\n\nAlthough it literally implies 'cannot endure', 「堪らない」 often functions as an intensifier, similar to 'extremely' or 'very much', but with a stronger connotation of being overwhelmed. It is commonly heard in casual conversation, reflecting a speaker's strong emotional response.",

            "term": "仕方がない",
            "meaning": "cannot be helped; it is inevitable",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「堪らない」, which expresses an intense, often uncontrollable feeling or desire, 「仕方がない」 signifies resignation or acceptance towards an unavoidable situation. One deals with the inevitability, rather than being overwhelmed by a sensation or urge."
        },
        {
            "term": "～てしょうがない",
            "meaning": "cannot help but; can't stand it; extremely (often with a nuance of being troubled or helpless)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both 「～てたまらない」 and 「～てしょうがない」 express strong, uncontrollable feelings, 「～てたまらない」 often implies a more intense, almost physically overwhelming sensation or desire, which can be positive or negative. 「～てしょうがない」, on the other hand, frequently carries a nuance of helplessness or being troubled by the feeling, usually tending towards negative or annoying sensations, though it can also be used for positive things, it suggests a feeling that is hard to manage."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「堪らない」 conveys a powerful, often overwhelming internal state or desire, 「仕方がない」 is about acknowledging and accepting an external circumstance that is beyond one's control. Think of 「堪らない」 as an internal struggle with intense feelings, and 「仕方がない」 as an external concession to reality. Using the correct expression depends on whether you want to emphasize your overwhelming emotion or your acceptance of an uncontrollable situation.\n\nWhen comparing 「～てたまらない」 and 「～てしょうがない」, the distinction is subtle but important. Both convey intensity, but 「～てたまらない」 leans more towards a profound, almost physical inability to contain the feeling (positive or negative), suggesting a more direct, perhaps even overwhelming, impact. 「～てしょうがない」 tends to imply a feeling that one is troubled by or helpless against, often for sensations that are annoying or difficult to cope with, even when positive. It's about being unable to control the situation or the feeling itself.",

            "nuance": "The use of 「甘くて堪らない」 emphasizes the speaker's overwhelming delight at the cake's sweetness, implying it's almost too good to handle, but in a positive way. The addition of the feminine particle 「わ」 (wa) further highlights the speaker's personal, internal feeling.",
            "etymology": "The use of 「わ」 as a feminine sentence-final particle adds a soft, emotional emphasis, making the speaker's feeling of delight more pronounced and personal."

            "nuance": "「堪りません」 here conveys an intense, almost unbearable level of fatigue, reflecting the speaker's weariness from demanding work. The polite form makes this a professional yet personal complaint. The alternative 「たまらないんです」 offers a slightly softer, more explanatory nuance while maintaining politeness.",
            "etymology": "The suffix 「んです」 or 「のです」 often adds an explanatory or emphatic nuance, presenting information as an explanation or cause for something, making the statement about being tired more profound."

            "nuance": "The phrase 「欲しくて堪らない」 with the casual ending 「んだ」 captures the intense, almost childlike, desire for the new game, indicating an irresistible urge. The use of 「ぜ」 (ze) by a younger male speaker adds a strong, masculine emphasis to his excitement and desire.",
            "etymology": "The sentence-final particle 「ぜ」 is largely associated with masculine speech, conveying assertion, emphasis, or invitation, and is often used by younger males to express strong feelings or opinions."
