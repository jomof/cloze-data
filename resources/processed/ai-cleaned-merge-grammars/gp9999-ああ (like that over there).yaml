etymology: The demonstrative series こ・そ・あ・ど (ko-so-a-do) is fundamental to Japanese, originating from
  ancient forms. ああ comes from あ (distant referent) + reduplication, or an earlier form あは. This あ root
  signifies distance, both physical and conceptual, akin to “yonder” or “that way.”
writeup: |-
  ああ is a demonstrative adverb that is part of the fundamental こ・そ・あ・ど (ko-so-a-do) series. This series helps specify the location or manner of something relative to the speaker and listener. Specifically, ああ means “like that” or “that way,” referring to something that is distant from both the speaker and the listener, or a manner that is generally understood or observed from a distance.

  Contrast this with:
  - こう (kou): “like this,” referring to something near the speaker or a manner being demonstrated by the speaker.
  - そう (sou): “like that,” referring to something near the listener, or a manner that has just been mentioned or is mutually understood between speaker and listener.
  - どう (dou): “how?” or “in what way?”, an interrogative asking about the manner or state.

  ああ can also be used as an interjection to express a strong emotional reaction, such as relief, sadness, or sudden understanding. In this use, it functions much like “Oh!” or “Ah!” in English, often conveying a sense of distance from the immediate physical context, but proximity to an emotional realization.

post_false_friends_writeup: The ko-so-a-do series (こう, そう, ああ, どう) forms the basis of Japanese demonstratives.
  While they all refer to manner or state, their crucial distinction lies in the spatial or conversational
  distance. Mastering this spatial and contextual difference is key to using them correctly. Think of
  こう as 'here/this way', そう as 'there/that way (near you)', and ああ as 'over there/that way (distant from
  us both)'.
