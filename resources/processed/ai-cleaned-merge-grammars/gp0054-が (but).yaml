    "etymology": "The particle 「が」 originally served a broader function, indicating the subject of a sentence. Over time, it evolved to also express contrast or connection between clauses, leading to its use as 'but' or 'however'. This conjunctive function highlights the information following 「が」 as being somehow distinct or noteworthy in relation to what precedes it.",
    "writeup": "As a particle, 「が」 has several uses in Japanese. However, each use shares a common theme: highlighting (A) as important, followed by (B). In this use, 「が」 translates to \"but\" or \"however\" in English.\n\n「が」 is placed directly after any form of verb or い-adjective. With a noun or な-adjective, use a conjugation of 「だ」 or 「です」 before 「が」.\n\nFrom these examples, we can see that 「が」 highlights that while (A) is important, there is extra information. Using 「が」 with the meaning of \"but\" is considered more formal, as it directly asserts there's additional information.\n\nSometimes a statement ends with 「が」. This implies that more information exists but is obvious, so it's left unsaid.",
