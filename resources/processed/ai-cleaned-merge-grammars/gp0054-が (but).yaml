    "etymology": "The particle 「が」 originally served a broader function, indicating the subject of a sentence. Over time, it evolved to also express contrast or connection between clauses, leading to its use as 'but' or 'however'. This conjunctive function highlights the information following 「が」 as being somehow distinct or noteworthy in relation to what precedes it.",
    "writeup": "As a particle, 「が」 has several different uses in Japanese. Each use shares a common theme: highlighting an initial piece of information (A) as important, followed by presenting additional information (B). In this usage, 「が」 translates to \"but\" or \"however\" in English.When connecting clauses, 「が」 is placed directly after a verb or an い-adjective in their plain forms. For nouns and な-adjectives, a conjugation of 「だ」 or 「です」 is required before 「が」.\nWhile often translated as \"but,\" 「が」 is generally much weaker than the English \"but.\" It can simply connect two sentences for stylistic reasons, even if they don't strongly contrast. It primarily indicates that while the first clause is true, there is more information to follow in the second clause. This nuance allows 「が」 to function as a neutral connective, merely signaling a shift or continuation of thought, rather than a strong opposition.Using 「が」 with the meaning of \"but\" is considered somewhat formal or direct in its assertion that additional information exists. This directness can sometimes make it sound less conversational than other conjunctions.It is also common to find a statement ending abruptly with 「が」. In such cases, it implies that further information exists, but it is either obvious from the context, or the speaker chooses to leave it unsaid, inviting the listener to infer the unspoken continuation.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「けど」 and 「だけど」 are more casual than 「が」, often used in spoken language and less formal writing. They can sometimes imply a softer contrast or a more personal feeling towards the preceding statement than 「が」, which is more neutral and factual. They can also introduce a slight implication of mild complaint or reservation that 「が」 doesn't carry on its own. While 「が」 is more direct in its assertion, 「けど」 tends to be more conversational and less formal. The former might feel slightly stiff in very casual dialogue where 「けど」 would be preferred. This implies 「が」 is more direct in its assertion that there is extra information, whereas 「けど」 is more conversational and less formal in its connection between clauses."
