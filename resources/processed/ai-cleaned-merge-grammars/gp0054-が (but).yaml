details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: teineigo (polite)
  particle-syntactic-function: conjunctive
etymology: The particle 「が」 originally served a broader function, indicating the subject of a sentence.
  Over time, it evolved to also express contrast or connection between clauses, leading to its use as
  'but' or 'however'. This conjunctive function highlights the information following 「が」 as being somehow
  distinct or noteworthy in relation to what precedes it.
writeup: 'As a particle, 「が」 has several different uses in Japanese. Each use shares a common theme: highlighting
  an initial piece of information (A) as important, followed by presenting additional information (B).
  In this usage, 「が」 translates to "but" or "however" in English.When connecting clauses, 「が」 is placed
  directly after a verb or an い-adjective in their plain forms. For nouns and な-adjectives, a conjugation
  of 「だ」 or 「です」 is required before 「が」.While often translated as "but," 「が」 is generally much weaker
  than the English "but." It can simply connect two sentences for stylistic reasons, even if they don''t
  strongly contrast. It primarily indicates that while the first clause is true, there is more information
  to follow in the second clause. This nuance allows 「が」 to function as a neutral connective, merely signaling
  a shift or continuation of thought, rather than a strong opposition.Using 「が」 with the meaning of "but"
  is considered somewhat formal or direct in its assertion that additional information exists. This directness
  can sometimes make it sound less conversational than other conjunctions.It is also common to find a
  statement ending abruptly with 「が」. In such cases, it implies that further information exists, but it
  is either obvious from the context, or the speaker chooses to leave it unsaid, inviting the listener
  to infer the unspoken continuation.'

  - term: けど・だけど
    meaning: But, However
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「けど」 and 「だけど」 are more casual than 「が」, often used in spoken language and less formal writing.
      They can sometimes imply a softer contrast or a more personal feeling towards the preceding statement
      than 「が」, which is more neutral and factual. They can also introduce a slight implication of mild
      complaint or reservation that 「が」 doesn't carry on its own. While 「が」 is more direct in its assertion,
      「けど」 tends to be more conversational and less formal. The former might feel slightly stiff in very
      casual dialogue where 「けど」 would be preferred. This implies 「が」 is more direct in its assertion
      that there is extra information, whereas 「けど」 is more conversational and less formal in its connection
      between clauses.
    grammar_point: けど・だけど (but・however)
  - term: ところが
    meaning: Even so, However, Even though, But
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「が」, 「ところが」 often introduces an unexpected or surprising result that goes against expectations
      formed by the preceding statement. It emphasizes the unpredictability of the consequence, which
      「が」 does not necessarily do. 「が」 simply connects; 「ところが」 signifies a reversal of expectation.
    grammar_point: ところが (unexpected contrast)
  - term: けれども
    meaning: But, Although
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「けれども」 is a slightly softer and generally more formal or literary way of expressing contrast
      than 「が」. It can convey a sense of hesitation or politeness, especially when used in formal speech
      or writing. 「が」 is more direct and objective, while 「けれども」 often carries a more nuanced or tentative
      tone.
    grammar_point: けれども (but・although)
  - term: だが・ですが
    meaning: But, Still, However, Nevertheless
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「だが」 (plain form) and 「ですが」 (polite form) are more formal and often used in writing or more
      serious speech contexts compared to 「が」. They tend to introduce a stronger sense of opposition or
      counter-argument than the simple connecting function of 「が」. 「が」 merely presents a contrast; 「だが/ですが」
      often introduces a rebuttal or a significant counterpoint.
    grammar_point: だが (but・however)
  - term: ものの
    meaning: Although, But, Even Though
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ものの」 implies a stronger sense of concession than 「が」, often used when the first clause would
      logically lead to a different outcome, but the second clause states the actual, unexpected result.
      It suggests a more significant discrepancy than 「が」. 「が」 is a neutral connector; 「ものの」 emphasizes
      a strong, often surprising, concession.
    grammar_point: ものの (although・but)
  - term: くせに
    meaning: Even though, And yet, Despite
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「が」, 「くせに」 carries a strong sense of resentment, criticism, or disapproval. It implies
      that the action or state in the second clause is contrary to what one would expect given the first
      clause, and the speaker is annoyed or critical of this contradiction. 「が」 is neutral; 「くせに」 is highly
      negative and judgmental.
    grammar_point: くせに (despite and yet)
  - term: なのに
    meaning: Even though, Despite that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「が」, 「なのに」 expresses a stronger sense of unexpectedness or dissatisfaction, often implying
      a logical contradiction or surprise, often with a tone of complaint or accusation. 「が」 is a simple
      connector; 「なのに」 conveys a sense of dismay or unfairness.
    grammar_point: のに (unexpected result)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing 「が」 with similar expressions, remember that 「が」 is generally
  a neutral connector that indicates a contrast or addition of information. When you want to convey a
  stronger sense of surprise, resentment, or concession, choose a different expression. For more casual
  situations, 「けど」 or 「だけど」 are suitable replacements. Each alternative carries specific nuances that
  enrich or alter the meaning of the connection between clauses.

        english: This book is long, but it's very interesting.
        hint: While 「けど」 is common in casual speech and also means 'but', it can sometimes imply a more
          personal or softer nuance. We're looking for a more objective and neutral connection suitable
          for introducing a topic to a friend.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長い です {けれど も}、とても 面白い です。
        english: This book is long, but it's very interesting.
        hint: 「けれども」 is a more formal or literary way of saying 'but'. We're looking for a more direct
          and concise connection for a casual recommendation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長い です。しかし、とても 面白い です。
        english: This book is long. However, it's very interesting.
        hint: 「しかし」 acts as a strong conjunction often used at the beginning of a sentence, emphasizing
          a more significant contrast or opposition than a neutral connector. We're looking for a softer,
          more direct connection.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長い です。{です が}、とても 面白い です。
        english: This book is long. However, it's very interesting.
        hint: 「ですが」 (or its plain form 「だが」) expresses a stronger, more definite opposition or counter-argument.
          While polite, it's not the best fit for simply softening a request. We're looking for a simple
          connective 'but' that lessens the impact of the interruption.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長い {もの の}、とても 面白い。
        english: Although this book is long, it's very interesting.
        hint: 「ものの」 implies a stronger sense of concession or an unexpected outcome given the preceding
          clause. We're looking for a more neutral connector.

        english: This book is long, but unexpectedly, it's very interesting.

          connection of contrasting information.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長い {の に}、とても 面白い。
        english: Even though this book is long, it's very interesting.
        hint: 「なのに」 implies a stronger sense of unexpectedness or dissatisfaction. We're looking for a
          neutral connection.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長い {くせ に}、とても 面白い。
        english: Despite this book being long, it's very interesting. (with a negative nuance)
        hint: 「くせに」 carries a strong negative or critical connotation. We're looking for a neutral 'but'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長く て、とても 面白い。
        english: This book is long, and very interesting.
        hint: Using the て-form connects clauses, often implying a sequence or cause-and-effect, or simply
          listing characteristics without emphasizing contrast. We're looking for a nuance of 'but'.
    scene: A student is recommending a book to their classmate, acknowledging its length but emphasizing
      its appeal.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「です」 maintains a polite-casual tone suitable for friends discussing hobbies. The
      contrast is presented neutrally, focusing on the book's attributes rather than strong personal feelings.
      The sentence structure is simple and direct. For example, 「長いんです」 uses the explanatory 'ん' to add
      a slight emphasis to the length, while still maintaining the friendly tone with 「です」.
    etymology: Using 「本」 for book and 「長い」 for long are straightforward applications of N5 vocabulary.
      The grammar point 「が」 here acts as a neutral connector, allowing the sentence to flow smoothly between
      the two descriptive clauses without strong emphasis on the contrast itself, which is typical of
      its usage at the N5 level for introductory sentence linking.
  - english: Excuse me, but what time is it now?
    japanese:

      - すみ ませ ん {が}、何時 です か。

          - すみ ませ ん {けど}、今 何 時 です か。
        english: Excuse me, but what time is it now?
        hint: While 「けど」 also means 'but' and is common, 「が」 provides a slightly more neutral and formal
          tone, making the request more polite and less abrupt when addressing a stranger.
      - competing_japanese:
          - すみ ませ ん、今 何 時 です か。
        english: Excuse me, what time is it now?
        hint: While grammatically correct, omitting the particle 'but' makes the request more direct.
          Adding a particle like {が} softens the request, indicating an apology for the interruption.
      - competing_japanese:
          - すみ ませ ん {けれど も}、今 何 時 です か。
        english: Excuse me, but what time is it now?
        hint: 「けれども」 is a slightly more formal or literary alternative to 「が」. Both are polite, but 「が」
          is often preferred for its directness in this type of polite inquiry.
      - competing_japanese:
          - すみ ませ ん {しかし}、今 何 時 です か。
        english: Excuse me, however, what time is it now?
        hint: 「しかし」 is a strong conjunctive adverb that typically starts a new sentence and introduces
          a significant contrast. It's too strong for a polite interruption like this. We're looking for
          a softer opening.
      - competing_japanese:
          - すみ ませ ん {です が}、今 何 時 です か。
        english: Excuse me, however, what time is it now?
        hint: 「ですが」 implies a stronger opposition or counter-argument. While polite, it's not the best
          fit for simply softening a request. We're looking for a simple connective 'but' that lessens
          the impact of the interruption.
      - competing_japanese:
          - すみ ませ ん {の に}、今 何 時 です か。
        english: Even though I'm sorry, what time is it now?
        hint: 「なのに」 expresses a strong sense of unexpectedness or dissatisfaction, which doesn't fit the
          context of a polite inquiry. We're looking for a neutral softening particle.
    scene: A man approaches a woman at a train station platform, needing to know the current time.
    register: formal
    setting: interrogative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「すみません」 followed by 「が」 is a common polite preamble to a request or question. The
      use of 「が」 here softens the directness of the question, implying 'I am sorry to bother you, but...'
      or 'Excuse me, (there's something I need to ask you)'. This politeness is crucial when addressing
      a stranger, making the interaction smoother and more respectful. For example, 「すみませんが」 softens the
      directness of the query 「何時ですか」.
    etymology: The use of 「すみません」 as an apology or polite lead-in is deeply ingrained in Japanese communication.
      Its combination with 「が」 in this context highlights how particles can subtly manage social interactions,
      making requests less intrusive. The historical development of 「が」 from a subject marker to a connective
      particle is demonstrated here in its role of linking the apology to the impending question without
      a strong logical opposition, but rather a gentle transition.

        hint: While 「けど」 is common in casual speech and also means 'but', it can sometimes imply a more
          personal or softer nuance. We're looking for a more objective and neutral connection.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この バッグ は 高い {の に}、すごく 可愛い です ね。
        english: Even though this bag is expensive, it's really cute, isn't it?
        hint: 「のに」 implies a stronger sense of unexpectedness or dissatisfaction, which doesn't quite
          fit the context of simply acknowledging a contrast in a friendly way. We're looking for a neutral
          'but'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この バッグ は 高く て、すごく 可愛い です ね。
        english: This bag is expensive, and it's really cute, isn't it?
        hint: Using the て-form connects clauses by listing characteristics or implying cause-and-effect,
          rather than emphasizing a contrast. We're looking for a nuance of 'but'.
    scene: Two friends are shopping together and one comments on a bag they see.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of 「です」 and 「ね」 makes this polite and conversational, suitable for friends discussing
      items. 「高いです」 (expensive) is directly contrasted with 「すごく可愛いですね」 (very cute, isn't it?), with 「が」
      serving as a neutral bridge. The sentence structure is simple and direct, conveying a mild observation
      and seeking agreement.
  - english: I tried my best, but I couldn't succeed.
    japanese:
      - 一生 懸命 頑張り まし た {が}、成功 でき ませ ん でし た。

        english: I tried my best, however, I couldn't succeed.
        hint: 「けれども」 is a slightly more formal or literary alternative. We're looking for a more direct
          and common way to state a factual outcome.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一生 懸命 頑張り まし た。しかし、成功 でき ませ ん でし た。
        english: I tried my best. However, I couldn't succeed.
        hint: 「しかし」 acts as a strong conjunctive adverb, often used at the beginning of a sentence, emphasizing
          a more significant contrast or opposition. We're looking for a softer, more direct connection.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一生 懸命 頑張っ た {の に}、成功 でき ませ ん でし た。
        english: Even though I tried my best, I couldn't succeed.
        hint: 「のに」 implies a stronger sense of regret or dissatisfaction with the outcome, which isn't
          necessarily conveyed by a neutral 'but'. We're looking for a simple connective 'but'.
    scene: A student is reporting the result of a difficult project to their teacher.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: apologetic
    nuance: The speaker uses the polite ます-form 「頑張りました」 (tried my best) and 「できませんでした」 (couldn't succeed),
      indicating a respectful tone suitable for addressing a teacher or superior. 「が」 provides a neutral
      transition from the effort to the unsuccessful outcome without expressing strong emotion like regret
      or blame, making it appropriate for a factual report.
  - english: Are you busy, but would you like to go to the concert with me?
    japanese:
      - お 忙しい です か {が}、コンサート に ご 一緒 し ませ ん か。

        english: Are you busy, but would you like to go to the concert with me?
        hint: While 「けど」 is also polite, 「が」 provides a slightly more formal and considerate softening
          of the invitation, acknowledging the other person's potential inconvenience more subtly.
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 忙しい です か。そして、コンサート に ご 一緒 し ませ ん か。
        english: Are you busy? And, would you like to go to the concert with me?
        hint: 「そして」 connects two separate thoughts but does not imply the softening or consideration that
          「が」 offers, making the invitation less indirect and potentially less polite.
    scene: A colleague politely asks another colleague out to a concert, considering their schedule.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: persuasive
    nuance: The 「お」 prefix in 「お忙しい」 (busy) and the honorific 「ご一緒し」 (accompany) with 「ませんか」 (won't you?)
      show a high level of politeness suitable for colleagues. 「が」 softens the request by first acknowledging
      a potential inconvenience, making the invitation more considerate and less demanding. This is a
      common pattern in Japanese for polite inquiries or invitations where one anticipates a potential
      obstacle.
  - english: My younger brother is quiet, but he's very kind.
    japanese:

        english: My younger brother is quiet, but he's very kind.
        hint: 「だけど」 is a more casual alternative to 「が」, though it conveys a similar contrast. We're looking
          for a slightly more neutral, standard connection.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 弟 は 静か で、とても 親切 です。
        english: My younger brother is quiet and very kind.
        hint: Using the て-form 「で」 simply lists characteristics without emphasizing a contrast. We're
          looking for a nuance of 'but'.
    scene: Someone is describing their sibling to a new friend they just met.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: This is a straightforward contrasting statement. The use of 「弟」 (younger brother) and the
      simple 「です」 indicate a casual, informative register, typical when talking about family to a peer.
      「静かです」 (quiet) and 「親切です」 (kind) are two distinct qualities linked by 「が」 to show a gentle contrast,
      implying that despite his quietness, kindness is also a prominent trait.
  - english: I understand what you're saying, but...
    japanese:
      - おっしゃる こと は 分かり ます {が}…

          - おっしゃる こと は 分かり ます {けれど も}…
        english: I understand what you're saying, however...
        hint: 「けれども」 is also polite and can imply hesitation, but 「が」 here is often used to signal a polite
          reservation or unstated counterpoint.
      - competing_japanese:
          - おっしゃる こと は 分かり ます。しかし…
        english: I understand what you're saying. However...
        hint: 「しかし」 implies a stronger, more direct disagreement or counter-argument, which might be too
          blunt in this context where a polite, implied reservation is intended.
    scene: A manager listens to a subordinate's suggestion, but has a reservation they're expressing indirectly.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: This is a highly nuanced usage of 「が」 where the second clause is omitted. The use of honorific
      「おっしゃる」 (to say) and polite 「分かります」 (understand) indicates a formal setting and respect for the
      listener. The trailing 「が」 creates an implied continuation, signaling that while the speaker understands,
      they have a reservation, a problem, or a differing opinion that they are either hesitant to express
      directly or expect the listener to infer. This polite, indirect communication is very common in
      professional Japanese settings, especially when disagreeing with a superior.
  - english: That's a good idea, but there are still some issues that need to be resolved.

        english: That's a good idea, however, there are still some issues that need to be resolved.
        hint: 「けれども」 is a slightly more formal way to express contrast. 「が」 is more direct for introducing
          a point of consideration after a positive statement.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 良い 提案 です。しかし、まだ 解決 す べき 問題 が いく つ か あり ます。
        english: That's a good idea. However, there are still some issues that need to be resolved.
        hint: 「しかし」 creates a stronger break and emphasizes a more significant opposition. 「が」 allows
          for a smoother, more continuous flow when introducing a reservation politely.
    scene: A team leader is giving feedback on a new proposal during a business meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of 「です」 and 「あります」 maintains a polite professional tone. 「が」 functions to gently introduce
      a reservation or a point of consideration after a positive statement, without sounding overly confrontational.
      This is typical in business discussions where feedback needs to be constructive and polite, allowing
      for a smooth transition from agreement to a point of concern.

        hint: 「けれども」 is a slightly more formal or literary alternative, often used in written reports.
          「が」 provides a more concise and commonly used connection for presenting findings orally or in
          less formal academic contexts.
      - competing_japanese:
          - データ は 売上 の 増加 を 示し て い ます。しかし、さらなる 分析 が 必要 です。
        english: The data shows an increase in sales. However, further analysis is required.
        hint: 「しかし」 introduces a stronger contrast and often signals a more critical or counter-argument.
          We're looking for a neutral connector that links a finding to a subsequent necessary action.
    scene: A researcher is presenting findings at an academic conference.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: This sentence uses formal and objective language ("データは...示しています," "分析が必要です"), appropriate
      for an academic or professional presentation. 「が」 connects the observed fact (data showing increase)
      with the logical next step or necessary action (further analysis), serving as a neutral connective
      that introduces additional information without strong opposition or emotional tone, typical for
      factual reporting.
  - english: It's raining outside, but it's not cold at all.
    japanese:
      - 外 は 雨 です {が}、全然 寒く ない です。
      - 外 は 雨 が 降っ て い ます {が}、全然 寒く ない です ね。
    english_literally: Outside is rain, but not at all cold.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 外 は 雨 {だ けど}、全然 寒く ない です。
        english: It's raining outside, but it's not cold at all.
        hint: 「だけど」 is a more casual alternative. While similar in meaning, 「が」 offers a slightly more
          standard and neutral tone.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 外 は 雨 で、全然 寒く ない です。
        english: It's raining outside and it's not cold at all.
        hint: Using the て-form 「で」 simply lists characteristics of the weather, whereas 「が」 specifically
          highlights the contrast between the rain and the temperature.
    scene: Two friends are looking out the window, observing the weather.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This is a simple, direct observation in a casual setting. 「外は雨です」 (it's raining outside) and
      「寒くないです」 (it's not cold) are linked by 「が」 to present a mild contrast – rain often implies cold,
      but here it doesn't. The use of 「全然」 (not at all) emphasizes the lack of coldness. The overall tone
      is conversational and explanatory.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「が」 is a highly versatile particle that can be used
  across various registers and situations. Whether introducing a gentle contrast, softening a request,
  or signaling an implied continuation, 「が」 allows for nuanced communication without the strong oppositional
  force often associated with 'but' in English. Pay attention to the context to fully grasp its precise
  function in any given sentence.
