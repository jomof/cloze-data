    "etymology": "The particle が originates from the classical Japanese genitive particle 'ga' (が), which indicated possession or belonging. Over time, it evolved to connect clauses and express various nuances, including contrast and emphasis. Its function as a conjunctive particle stems from its ability to highlight the preceding clause while introducing a related but distinct idea.",
    "writeup": "As a particle, が has several different uses in Japanese. However, each of these different uses share a common theme: highlighting (A) as important in relation to (B). In this use, が functions similarly to \"but\" or \"however\" in English. This nuance of が is used directly after any form of verb or い-adjective, but requires one of the conjugations of だ or です before it when used with a noun or な-adjective. From these examples, we can see that が simply highlights that \"while (A) is important, there is extra information\". Using が with the meaning of \"but\" is considered to be quite formal, as it sounds rather direct in asserting that there is additional information. Sometimes a statement will end with が. In these cases, it just means that more information exists, but it is obvious, so it does not need to be stated.",
