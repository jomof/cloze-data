    "post_false_friends_writeup": "「ろくに～ない」, 「全然～ない」, 「ほとんど～ない」, and 「あまり～ない」 all express some form of negation, but they differ in nuance. Use 「ろくに～ない」 when you want to emphasize that something wasn't done properly or to a satisfactory degree. Use 「全然～ない」 when you mean something wasn't done at all. 「ほとんど～ない」 is used when something was done very little or rarely. 「あまり～ない」 also indicates a low degree or infrequency, similar to 「ほとんど～ない」, but often implies a less extreme condition.",
