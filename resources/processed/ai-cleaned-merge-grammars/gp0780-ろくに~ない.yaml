    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ろくに～ない」 indicates that something is **not done properly, sufficiently, or satisfactorily.** It is always used with a verb in its negative form. This phrase expresses that an action is performed poorly, inadequately, or hardly at all. It emphasizes a lack of proper execution or performance and can convey a sense of disappointment, regret, or even frustration about the quality or quantity of an action. It is frequently used in everyday conversation and writing.\n\nIt implies that while an action might have been attempted, or some small amount of it might have been done, the quality or thoroughness was far below what is expected or necessary. For instance, 「ろくに寝ていない」 (rokuni nete inai) implies that one got some sleep, but it was not enough or not restful, leading to continued tiredness, rather than a complete lack of sleep.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "「ろくに～ない」, 「全然～ない」, 「ほとんど～ない」, 「あまり～ない」, and 「陸に〜ない」 all express some form of negation, but they differ in nuance. Use 「ろくに～ない」 when you want to emphasize that something wasn't done properly or to a satisfactory degree, implying a failure in quality or thoroughness rather than a complete absence. Use 「全然～ない」 when you mean something wasn't done at all. 「ほとんど～ない」 is used when something was done very little or rarely, focusing on quantity. 「あまり～ない」 also indicates a low degree or infrequency, similar to 「ほとんど～ない」, but often implies a less extreme condition. 「陸に〜ない」 carries a very similar meaning and nuance to 「ろくに〜ない」, but is generally found in more formal contexts.",

This implies a lack of quality or thoroughness in the action rather than a complete absence. The use of 「運動」 can imply not just the act of exercising, but also the benefit or effect of exercise. Thus, 「ろくに運動していない」 means they haven't gotten sufficient or proper exercise to achieve their fitness goals. It's not that they don't do any exercise, but rather that what they do isn't good enough or doesn't feel sufficient for their needs. The male speaker's age adds a common context for someone balancing work and fitness. The casual register makes it suitable for a personal complaint. The serious setting reflects the genuine concern over health and fitness. The combination of 「忙しすぎて」 and 「ろくに」 emphasizes the external constraints preventing proper execution."

    "post_example_writeup": "As seen in the examples, 「ろくに～ない」 is versatile and can be used with various verbs in their negative forms to express that an action, state, or quantity is unsatisfactory or inadequate. It often carries a nuance of something being lacking despite expectations or attempts. This grammar point is particularly useful for expressing frustration, disappointment, or a sense of failure in achieving a desired level of quality or sufficiency. It often suggests a gap between what was desired or expected and what was actually achieved, usually with a negative emotional tone from the speaker.",
