        "usage-context": "Used to express the viewpoint or perspective of a person or organization. It is not used to express one's own opinion or perspective."

    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「に」 (particle indicating point of view) + 「したら」 (conditional form of the verb 「する」 meaning \"to do\"). It literally means \"if we were to do based on...\".",
    "writeup": "「にしたら」 expresses a viewpoint or perspective, translated as \"from the point of view of\" or \"from the standpoint of.\" It literally conveys \"if one were to do based on (A),\" emphasizing that the speaker is considering a situation from (A)'s particular aspect to discuss a possibility or make an assumption. The grammatical structure attaches to nouns that identify people or organizations, from which the speaker then derives an opinion or expectation. The sentence that follows 「にしたら」 will typically be an assumption about what the speaker expects to be true for the person or organization. While 「にしたら」 and 「にすれば」 are nearly identical in meaning, 「にすれば」 is generally preferred in more formal contexts. A crucial point is that this structure is **never** used to express one's own viewpoint or opinion. It is reserved for hypothesizing about **others'** perspectives, as one cannot \"go off\" themselves hypothetically when their own thoughts are already known.",
