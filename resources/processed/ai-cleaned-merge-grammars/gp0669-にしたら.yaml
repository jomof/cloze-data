    "writeup": "「にしたら」 is used to express a viewpoint or perspective, similar to \"from the point of view of.\" It's used when the speaker is making an assumption or stating an opinion based on someone else's position. It's crucial to remember that 「にしたら」 is used for others, not for oneself. Think of it as standing in someone else's shoes to consider their feelings or opinions. You're essentially saying, \"If we were to consider things from X's perspective...\"",
