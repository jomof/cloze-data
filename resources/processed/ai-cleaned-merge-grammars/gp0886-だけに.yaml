    "etymology": "だけに is composed of だけ (dake), meaning \"only\" or \"just,\" and に (ni), a particle that can indicate reason or cause. The combination emphasizes that something is particularly true or noteworthy because of a specific reason or condition.",
    "writeup": "だけに is a grammar pattern that often translates to \"as might be expected of (A),\" \"it's only natural due to (A),\" or simply \"because of (A).\" It combines だけ, meaning \"just,\" and に, a particle indicating reason. The literal sense is \"just in that it's (A),\" drawing the listener's attention to (A) to show that (B) is noteworthy because of it. It can highlight either positive or negative results due to (A) and appears after verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (followed by な), or nouns.\n\nだけに emphasizes that (B) is a level above what's usually expected because of (A). This can relate to difficulty, emotional reaction, volume, or anything quantifiable. In essence, it underscores that (B) is remarkable specifically due to (A).",
