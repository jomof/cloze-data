    "writeup": "だけに is a grammar pattern that often translates to \"as might be expected of (A),\" \"it's only natural due to (A),\" or simply \"because of (A).\" It combines だけ, meaning \"just,\" and に, a particle indicating reason. The literal sense is \"just in that it's (A),\" drawing the listener's attention to (A) to show that (B) is noteworthy because of it. It can highlight either positive or negative results due to (A) and appears after verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (followed by な), or nouns.\n\nだけに emphasizes that (B) is a level above what's usually expected because of (A). This can relate to difficulty, emotional reaction, volume, or anything quantifiable. In essence, it underscores that (B) is remarkable specifically due to (A).",
