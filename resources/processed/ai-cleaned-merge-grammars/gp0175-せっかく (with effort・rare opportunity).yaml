  rare or special. You can also use 「せっかくですが」 to politely decline an offer or 「せっかくですから」 to accept one.

  - term: わざわざ
    meaning: expressly; specially; deliberately; taking the trouble to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「せっかく」 and 「わざわざ」 relate to effort, 「わざわざ」 emphasizes the act of deliberately going
      out of one's way, whereas 「せっかく」 emphasizes the preciousness of the effort and potential regret
      if it's wasted.
    grammar_point: わざわざ (going out of one's way)
  - term: せめて
    meaning: at least
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both imply a minimum or making the most of a situation, 「せっかく」 focuses on utilizing
      a special opportunity or acknowledging effort to avoid waste, whereas 「せめて」 emphasizes doing the
      minimum possible in a difficult or undesirable situation, or expressing a minimal wish.
    grammar_point: せめて (at least)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both relate to effort, 「わざわざ」 emphasizes the act of deliberately going
  out of one's way, whereas 「せっかく」 emphasizes the preciousness of the effort and potential regret if it's
  wasted. Choose 「わざわざ」 when the focus is on the deliberate action, and 「せっかく」 when highlighting the value
  of the effort and the implications of its outcome. 「せめて」 is used for situations where only a minimum
  outcome is hoped for or achieved, unlike 「せっかく」 which suggests making the most of a good opportunity.
examples:
  - english: Even though I took the trouble to bake a cake, nobody ate it.
    japanese:
      - '{せっかく} 作っ た ケーキ な の に、誰 も 食べ なかっ た。'
      - '{せっかく} 作っ た ケーキ な の に、誰 も 食べ ませ ん でし た。'
      - '{せっかく} 焼い た ケーキ な の に、誰 も 食べ て くれ ない の よ。'
    english_literally: Despite the cake I made with great effort, nobody ate it.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 作っ た ケーキ な の に、誰 も 食べ なかっ た。
        english: Even though I made a cake, nobody ate it.
        hint: The original sentence emphasizes the effort put into making the cake and the disappointment
          of that effort being wasted. This alternative simply states the fact that a cake was made but
          not eaten. We're looking for an expression that highlights the effort and the subsequent regret.
    scene: Someone feeling dejected after their efforts were not appreciated.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: The 「のに」 emphasizes the speaker's disappointment that their effort 「作った」 was not appreciated.
    etymology: The term 'ケーキ' (cake) is a loanword from English; its etymological roots are therefore
      outside of Japanese, but its common use in Japanese daily life makes it a familiar item.
  - english: Since I've taken the trouble to come all the way to Kyoto, I want to see various temples.
    japanese:
      - '{せっかく} 京都 に 来 た の だ から、色々 な お 寺 を 見 たい。'
      - '{せっかく} 京都 に 参り まし た の です から、色々 な お 寺 を 見 たい と 思い ます。'
      - '{せっかく} 京都 に 来 た ん だ し、色々 な お 寺 を 見 て おき たい ね。'
    english_literally: Since I took the trouble to come to Kyoto, I want to see various temples.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 京都 に 来 た の だ から、色々 な お 寺 を 見 たい。
        english: Since I came to Kyoto, I want to see various temples.
        hint: The original sentence highlights the special effort or rare opportunity of coming to Kyoto.
          This alternative just states the reason without that added nuance of effort or specialness.
          We're looking for an expression that conveys 'taking the trouble' or 'making the effort'.
    scene: A tourist expressing their desire to make the most of their trip.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: optimistic
    nuance: 「せっかく」 highlights the special trip to Kyoto, and 「のだから」 is used to state the reason. The speaker's
      desire to fully experience Kyoto is emphasized by the phrase 「色々なお寺を見たい」. This nuance of making
      the most of a unique opportunity is central to 「せっかく」.
    etymology: The term '京都' (Kyoto) literally means 'capital city', originating from Chinese and adopted
      into Japanese. Its historical significance as a former capital of Japan gives it a cultural weight
      that enhances the sense of 'specialness' when visiting.
  - english: Since it's a rare chance, I'll try my best to propose.
    japanese:
      - '{せっかく の} チャンス だ から、頑張っ て プロポーズ し て みよう。'
      - '{せっかく の} チャンス です から、頑張っ て プロポーズ し て みよう と 思い ます。'
      - '{せっかく の} チャンス だ し、思い切っ て プロポーズ し て みる か。'
    english_literally: Since it's a rare chance, I'll try my best to propose.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - いい チャンス だ から、頑張っ て プロポーズ し て みよう。
        english: Since it's a good chance, I'll try my best to propose.
        hint: The original sentence emphasizes the rarity and specialness of the opportunity. This alternative
          simply states it's a 'good' chance, lacking the nuance of it being a particularly valuable or
          unique occasion. We're looking for an expression that signifies a rare or valuable opportunity.
    scene: A person mustering courage to confess their feelings.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    nuance: 「せっかくのチャンス」 indicates a rare opportunity, and 「頑張ってプロポーズしてみよう」 indicates their determination.
      The casualness of 「だ から」 and 「し て みよう」 fits the personal, somewhat nervous, tone of a proposal.
    etymology: The term 'プロポーズ' (propose) is a direct loanword from the English 'proposal', retaining
      its core meaning of asking someone to marry you. The integration into Japanese often involves the
      verb 「する」.
  - english: I appreciate your kind offer, but I have a prior engagement today, so I'm afraid I cannot
      go.
    japanese:
      - '{せっかく} です が、今日 は 先約 が ある の で、申し訳 あり ませ ん が、伺え ませ ん。'
      - '{せっかく} です が、今日 は ちょっと 都合 が 悪い の で、行け ませ ん。'
    english_literally: It's an effort/kind offer, but I have a prior engagement today, so I'm sorry, but
      I cannot go.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 申し訳 あり ませ ん が、今日 は 先約 が ある の で、伺え ませ ん。
        english: I'm sorry, but I have a prior engagement today, so I cannot go.
        hint: The original sentence politely acknowledges the effort or kindness of the person offering
          the invitation. This alternative is a direct apology and refusal, missing the nuance of appreciation
          for the offer. We're looking for a phrase that softens the refusal by first acknowledging the
          other person's effort.
    scene: A person politely declining an invitation from a friend to an event.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: apologetic
    nuance: 「せっかくですが」 is a polite way to decline an invitation, acknowledging the effort or kindness of
      the person who made the offer. The use of 「申し訳ありませんが、伺えません」 further enhances the politeness and
      humility of the refusal. This phrase is a common set expression that softens a refusal by first
      appreciating the offer.
    etymology: 「先約」 (sen'yaku) means 'prior appointment' or 'prior engagement', composed of 先 (sen, 'previous')
      and 約 (yaku, 'promise' or 'agreement').
  - english: Since you've gone to the trouble, I'll accept it without hesitation.
    japanese:
      - '{せっかく} です から、遠慮 なく いただき ます。'
      - '{せっかく} だ から、遠慮 なく いただく よ。'
      - '{せっかく} だ から、遠慮 なく いただく わ ね。'
    english_literally: Since you've gone to the trouble, I will accept it without hesitation.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - そう です から、遠慮 なく いただき ます。
        english: Therefore, I will accept it without hesitation.
        hint: The original sentence conveys gratitude for the effort someone made. This alternative simply
          implies a logical consequence without expressing appreciation for the trouble taken. We're looking
          for an expression that specifically thanks someone for their effort or kindness before accepting.
    scene: Accepting a gift or offer with gratitude.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「せっかくですから」 shows gratitude for the offer. The phrase 「遠慮なくいただきます」 directly translates to 'I
      will receive it without hesitation,' showing proper etiquette and appreciation for the effort made.
      The use of 「いただきます」 (itadakimasu) is a humble expression of receiving, further emphasizing politeness.
    etymology: 「遠慮なく」 (enryo naku) means 'without reserve' or 'without hesitation'. 遠慮 (enryo) originally
      meant 'to think deeply about the future' or 'to think from afar', leading to its modern meaning
      of 'holding back' or 'modesty'.
  - english: Despite all the preparations I made, the party was canceled due to rain.
    japanese:
      - '{せっかく} 準備 し た の に、雨 で パーティー が 中止 に なっ て しまっ た。'
      - '{せっかく} 準備 し た の に、雨 で パーティー は 中止 に なっ て しまい まし た。'
      - '{せっかく} 準備 し た ん だ けど、雨 の せい で パーティー が 中止 に なっ ちゃっ た。'
    english_literally: Despite preparing with great effort, the party was canceled due to rain.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 準備 し た の に、雨 で パーティー が 中止 に なっ て しまっ た。
        english: Even though I prepared, the party was canceled due to rain.
        hint: The original sentence emphasizes the significant effort put into the preparations and the
          disappointment of it being wasted. This alternative simply states the fact of preparation and
          cancellation, lacking the strong emotional impact of the effort being for naught. We're looking
          for an expression that highlights the effort and subsequent disappointment.
    scene: Someone expressing frustration over a canceled event.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「せっかく」 highlights the effort put into the preparations, and 「のに」 expresses frustration. The
      use of 「中止になってしまった」 implies a sense of regret and disappointment over the cancellation, emphasizing
      that the positive outcome was prevented.
    etymology: 「パーティー」 (party) is a loanword from English. 「中止」 (chūshi) means 'cancellation', formed
      from 中 (chū, 'middle' or 'in progress') and 止 (shi, 'to stop'), literally 'stopping in the middle'.
  - english: Now that I've had the good fortune to meet you, let's keep in touch.
    japanese:
      - '{せっかく} あなた と 知り合え た ん です から、これ から も 連絡 を 取り合い ましょう。'
      - '{せっかく} 君 と 知り合え た ん だ し、今後 とも 連絡 を 取り合おう よ。'
      - '{せっかく} こう し て 知り合え た の だ から、是非 今後 とも 交流 を 続け ましょう。'
    english_literally: Since I had the good fortune to meet you, let's keep in touch from now on.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あなた と 知り合え た ん です から、これ から も 連絡 を 取り合い ましょう。
        english: Since I met you, let's keep in touch.
        hint: The original sentence conveys a sense of rare good fortune or a special opportunity in meeting
          someone. This alternative simply states the fact of having met, without that added layer of
          preciousness or gratitude. We're looking for an expression that implies a fortunate or special
          encounter.
    scene: Ending a pleasant first-time encounter with someone you want to know better.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「知り合えたんですから」 emphasizes gratitude for a fated meeting, and the 「ましょう」 shows his
      warm desire to continue contact with her. The speaker's use of 'あなた' (you) to address the listener
      is common among younger male speakers in a friendly context, signaling a respectful yet friendly
      connection.
    etymology: 「連絡」 (renraku) means 'contact' or 'communication', composed of 連 (ren, 'to connect') and
      絡 (raku, 'to entangle').
  - english: Now that we've come all this way, why don't we relax a little longer?
    japanese:
      - '{せっかく} ここ まで 来 た ん だ から、もう 少し ゆっくり し て いき ませ ん か。'
      - '{せっかく} ここ まで 来 た ん だ し、もう 少し ゆっくり し て いこう よ。'
      - '{せっかく} ここ まで 来 た の だ から、もう 少し 滞在 し て も いい の で は ない でしょ う か。'
    english_literally: Since we've come all the way here, why don't we stay a little longer?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ まで 来 た ん だ から、もう 少し ゆっくり し て いき ませ ん か。
        english: Since we came all this way, why don't we relax a little longer?
        hint: The original sentence implies that effort was made to come all this way, suggesting it would
          be a shame to leave quickly. This alternative states the fact of having arrived, but lacks the
          nuance of the effort involved or the suggestion to make the most of the situation. We're looking
          for an expression that emphasizes the effort put into coming and implies making the most of
          the current situation.
    scene: Suggesting prolonging a pleasant outing with a romantic interest.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The 「んだから」 gently steers the conversation, implying a shared effort or situation, and the
      「いきませんか」 is a softer invitation. The casual tone suits a flirty setting between individuals. The
      usage of 'ゆっくりしていきませんか' implies a desire to extend the pleasant time together, making the most of
      the special effort of having traveled to that location.
    etymology: 「ゆっくり」 (yukkuri) means 'slowly' or 'at ease', an adverb that suggests taking one's time
      and relaxing.
  - english: Even though I went to the trouble of making dinner, the guests were late.
    japanese:
      - '{せっかく} 晩ご飯 を 作っ た の に、お 客 さん が 遅刻 し て き た。'
      - '{せっかく} 晩ご飯 を 用意 し た の に、お 客 様 が 遅れ て いらっしゃい まし た。'
    english_literally: With effort/trouble, I made dinner, but the guests arrived late.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 晩ご飯 を 作っ た の に、お 客 さん が 遅刻 し て き た。
        english: Even though I made dinner, the guests were late.
        hint: The original sentence emphasizes the effort put into making dinner and the frustration of
          that effort being somewhat wasted. This alternative simply states the fact without the nuance
          of special effort. We're looking for an expression that highlights the effort and the subsequent
          inconvenience.
    scene: Someone feeling annoyed that their careful planning for dinner was disrupted.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「せっかく」 conveys the speaker's effort and disappointment that the guests were late, potentially
      making the food cold or plans disrupted. The 「のに」 clearly expresses this sense of regret. The phrasing
      「お客さんが遅刻してきた」 suggests an unexpected and somewhat annoying situation.
    etymology: 「遅刻」 (chikoku) means 'lateness' or 'being late', commonly used for being late to an appointment
      or scheduled event.
  - english: Since it's a rare chance, you should definitely give it a try.
    japanese:
      - '{せっかく の} 機会 だ から、ぜひ 挑戦 し て みる べき だ よ。'
      - '{せっかく の} 機会 です から、ぜひ 挑戦 なさる べき です。'
      - '{せっかく の} 機会 な の だ から、挑戦 し て み ない か。'
    english_literally: Since it's a rare chance, you should definitely try to challenge it.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - いい 機会 だ から、ぜひ 挑戦 し て みる べき だ よ。
        english: Since it's a good chance, you should definitely give it a try.
        hint: The original sentence emphasizes the *rarity* and *uniqueness* of the opportunity. This
          alternative suggests it's just a 'good' chance, missing the special, perhaps once-in-a-lifetime,
          quality. We're looking for an expression that implies a particularly valuable or uncommon opportunity.
    scene: A mentor encouraging a younger colleague to take on a challenging project that might not come
      again.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: inspirational
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「せっかくの機会」 highlights that this is a valuable and perhaps fleeting opportunity. The 「ぜひ挑戦してみるべきだよ」
      is a strong encouragement from an older male speaker to a younger male, implying that missing this
      chance would be a waste. The use of 「だよ」 adds a touch of casual but firm advice.
  - english: Don't just stay in. Now that it's a rare sunny day, why don't we go out for a change?
    japanese:
      - 家 に いる だけ じゃ なく て、{せっかく の} 晴れ だ から、どこ か に 出かけ ませ ん か。
      - 家 に いる だけ じゃ なく て、{せっかく の} 晴れ な ん だ から、どこ か に 出かけよ う よ。

          - 家 に いる だけ じゃ なく て、晴れ だ から、どこ か に 出かけ ませ ん か。
        english: Not just staying at home, since it's sunny, why don't we go out somewhere?
        hint: The original sentence emphasizes the special and rare nature of the sunny day, suggesting
          it would be a shame not to enjoy it. This alternative simply states that it's sunny, lacking
          the nuance of it being an exceptional occasion. We're looking for an expression that highlights
          the preciousness of the good weather.
    scene: A person trying to convince a friend to go out on a beautiful day, implying it would be a waste
      to stay indoors.
    register: casual
    setting: persuasive
    nuance: 「せっかくの晴れ」 emphasizes the rare and precious nature of good weather, especially if it's been
      raining or gloomy. The phrase 「どこかに出かけませんか」 is a gentle invitation, leveraging the 'specialness'
      of the day to persuade. The use of 「じゃなくて」 sets up a contrast with staying home.
  - english: Since you brought me such a wonderful souvenir, I'll put it in a prominent place.
    japanese:
      - '{せっかく} こんな 素敵 な お 土産 を くださっ た の で、大切 に 飾ら せ て いただき ます。'

        english: Since you gave me such a wonderful souvenir, I will display it carefully.
        hint: The original sentence conveys appreciation for the effort or thought behind the gift, making
          it feel more special. This alternative is more neutral, simply stating that a gift was received.
          We're looking for an expression that conveys gratitude for the effort or kindness in bringing
          the souvenir.
    scene: Receiving a thoughtful gift from a colleague or friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「せっかく」 here expresses sincere gratitude for the effort and thoughtfulness behind the gift.
      The honorific 「くださった」 and humble 「飾らせていただきます」 further elevate the politeness, showing deep appreciation
      for the gesture.
    etymology: 「お土産」 (omiyage) refers to a souvenir or present bought when returning from a trip. The
      prefix お- (o-) is an honorific. The latter part, 土産 (miyage), is thought to come from 土 (tsuchi,
      'earth/land') + 産 (sange/san, 'produce'), referring to products of the local land.
  - english: You should use the gift card now, since it was given to you with great effort.
    japanese:

        english: Since it's a gift card you received, you should use it.
        hint: The original sentence emphasizes that the gift card was given with effort or kindness, suggesting
          it would be a waste not to use it. This alternative simply states that it's a gift card. We're
          looking for an expression that highlights the value of the gesture behind the gift.
    scene: Advising a friend to use a gift card rather than letting it expire or go unused.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「せっかくもらった」 implies that the gift card was given with good intentions or effort by the giver,
      so not using it would be a waste of their kindness. 「使ったほうがいいよ」 is a friendly suggestion. The nuance
      here is about respecting the giver's intent.
  - english: Since I bought such an expensive camera, I should learn to use it properly.
    japanese:
      - '{せっかく} 高い カメラ を 買っ た の だ から、ちゃんと 使い 方 を 勉強 し ない と ね。'
      - '{せっかく} 高い カメラ を 購入 し た の です から、きちんと 使用 方法 を 学習 し なけれ ば なり ませ ん ね。'
    english_literally: Since I bought such an expensive camera with effort, I need to study how to use
      it properly.

        english: Since I bought an expensive camera, I need to learn to use it properly.
        hint: The original sentence emphasizes the significant investment made in buying the camera, suggesting
          it would be a waste not to maximize its use. This alternative simply states that the camera
          is expensive. We're looking for an expression that highlights the effort or cost involved and
          the implied obligation to make it worthwhile.
    scene: Someone reflecting on their recent purchase and committing to learning how to use it.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「せっかく高いカメラを買った」 emphasizes the considerable expense and effort involved in acquiring the camera.
      The phrase 「ちゃんと使い方を勉強しないとね」 implies a self-imposed obligation to make the most of the investment,
      reflecting a sense of responsibility and avoiding waste.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 「せっかく」 is a versatile adverb that can express
  a range of emotions, from appreciation and gratitude to disappointment and regret. Its use often highlights
  the significance of an effort, an opportunity, or a situation, emphasizing the desire to make the most
  of it or the sadness when it's not fully realized.
