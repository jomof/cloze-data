    "etymology": "The particle へ evolved from the verb 経 (へ, *fu*), meaning \"to pass through\" or \"to go through\". This reflects its function of indicating a direction or path toward a destination.",
    "writeup": "へ is a particle used to describe a place that someone or something is moving toward or in contact with. In many cases, the particles に and へ are interchangeable, but there is a slight difference in meaning. へ focuses more on the distance or effort required to get between (A) and (B), while に focuses more on the connection between (A) and (B). へ always comes after the noun signifying the destination.\n\nFor example, while 「大阪にようこそ」 and 「大阪へようこそ」 may seem the same at first glance, へ shows that there is a space between the speaker and Osaka, while に puts the emphasis solely on the destination. This is why common expressions such as 「city/country name へ ようこそ」 sound very polite. It's like saying, \"Welcome, and we acknowledge your journey/effort to get here.\" Similarly, in the TV-show example, this commonly means \"thank you for your effort to watch this particular show, out of all the ones you could have chosen.\"",

            "nuance": "「ようこそ」 is a polite greeting.",
            "etymology": "「ようこそ」 means \"welcome\". The 「へ」 emphasizes the journey to Osaka."
