    "etymology": "The verb 「致す (いたす)」 originally meant \"to reach\" or \"to bring about.\" Over time, it evolved to be used as a humble form of 「する (suru)」, indicating that the speaker is performing an action with deference towards the listener. The kanji 「致」 itself carries a nuance of respect and formality.",
    "writeup": "「いたす」, often written as 「致す」, is a humble 「う」-verb that refers to the speaker's actions or those within their inner circle (e.g., their company). Similar to 「お〜する」, 「いたす」 means \"to do.\"  It is used to show respect to the listener by lowering oneself.  Here's how to use it:\n\n*   **For Suru Verbs:** Simply replace 「する」 with 「いたします」.\n*   **For Other Verbs:** Add 「いたします」 to the ます-stem of the verb, while attaching 「お」 or 「ご」 to the beginning, depending on whether the word is of Japanese or Chinese origin.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Words including the kanji 「拝 (hai)」, meaning \"to worship\" or \"to revere,\" usually don't require 「お」, 「ご」, or 「いたす」 because the word itself is already respectful.\n*   「いたす」 is considered slightly more humble than 「お〜する」, making it common in advertisements or by company employees.",
