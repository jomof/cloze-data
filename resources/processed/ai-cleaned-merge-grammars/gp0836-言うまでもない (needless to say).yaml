jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: General use
etymology: This expression combines the verb 「言う (iu)」 (to say), the adverbial particle 「まで (made)」 (until),
  the particle 「も (mo)」 (also, even), and the い-adjective 「ない (nai)」 (not). Literally, it suggests that
  something is so obvious that there's no need to even mention it.
writeup: 「言うまでもない (Iu made mo nai)」 translates to "it goes without saying" or "it is needless to say."
  It's used to indicate that something is so obvious that it doesn't require explicit mention. Unlike
  「〜は言うまでもない」, which typically follows a phrase, 「言うまでもない」 often starts the sentence. It can be followed
  by 「ことだが」, 「が」, 「けど」, adding a "but" nuance. This phrase is a polite way to express something obvious
  without sounding arrogant.
false_friends:
  - term: は言うまでもない
    meaning: It goes without saying (that), (It is) needless to say, I don't need to remind you
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「言うまでもない」, which often introduces a general obvious point or acts adverbially, 「〜は言うまでもない」
      always follows the specific topic or object being discussed, emphasizing that *that particular thing*
      is self-evident.
    grammar_point: は言うまでもない (goes without saying)
  - term: もちろん
    meaning: Of course; naturally; certainly.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「もちろん」 directly states 'of course,' 「言うまでもない」 implies a shared understanding of the
      obviousness, often setting up a point that *doesn't need to be said* but is mentioned for emphasis
      or to introduce further information.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:もちろん (of course)
  - term: 当然
    meaning: Natural; proper; right; reasonable; deserved; as a matter of course.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「当然」 emphasizes something as a logical outcome or expected truth. 「言うまでもない」 focuses on the
      *unnecessary* aspect of stating something because it is so self-evident, sometimes hinting at a
      deeper implication or setting up a contrast.
    grammar_point: て当然だ (natural・obvious)
  - term: 当たり前
    meaning: Natural; ordinary; common sense; usual; obvious.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「当たり前」 asserts something as a self-evident fact or common sense. 「言うまでもない」 adds a nuance of
      'this is so clear that I don't even need to say it, but I will for emphasis or reminder,' often
      used to gently preface a known truth.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:当たり前 (natural or obvious)
  - term: 周知 の 事実
    meaning: A well-known fact; common knowledge.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「周知 の 事実」 implies a fact that is publicly and widely known. 「言うまでもない」 is more colloquial and
      suitable when introducing an obvious point as a lead-in to a less obvious one, or as a gentle reminder.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:周知 の 事実 (well-known fact)
  - term: 明白
    meaning: Clear; obvious; evident.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「明白」 means 'clear' or 'obvious' based on evidence or provability. 「言うまでもない」 suggests a point
      so fundamental it almost doesn't need to be articulated, suitable for universally accepted truths
      or principles.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:明白 (clear)
  - term: 自明
    meaning: Self-evident; axiomatic.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「自明」 means 'self-evident' and is often used in formal contexts like logic or mathematics.
      「言うまでもない」 is more conversational and emphasizes the universally accepted nature of the statement
      in a general context.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:自明 (self-evident)
  - term: はもとより
    meaning: Not only... but also; let alone; from the start / by nature.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「はもとより」 implies something is already understood or expected from the beginning, 「言うまでもない」
      focuses more on the 'it goes without saying' aspect, often leading into a surprising or additional
      point.
    grammar_point: はもとより・のみならず (not only・let alone)
  - term: 明らか
    meaning: Clear; obvious; evident; apparent.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「明らか」 means 'clear' or 'obvious' based on evidence or appearance. 「言うまでもない」 in this context
      expresses an internal, deeply felt understanding that transcends mere clarity, making it more emotional
      and reflective.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:明らか (clear or obvious)
  - term: 常識 的
    meaning: Common-sensical; reasonable; customary.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「常識 的」 refers to something that is reasonable or in line with common sense. 「言うまでもない」 implies
      an inherent truth that should be known, making the reminder more impactful in an instructional or
      advisory setting.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:常識 的 (common-sensical)
  - term: 十分
    meaning: Enough; sufficient; ample.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「十分 だ」 means 'it's enough' or 'sufficient'. 「言うまでもない」 implies that the speaker is so overwhelmed
      or convinced that words are rendered unnecessary, conveying a deeper emotional impact than mere
      sufficiency.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:十分 (sufficient)
  - term: いらない
    meaning: Unnecessary; unneeded; useless.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いらない」 means 'unnecessary' or 'don't need'. While related, 「言うまでもない」 specifically highlights
      that the emotion or fact is so obvious and complete that no words are required to express it, often
      conveying a sense of profoundness.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:いらない (unnecessary)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between 「言うまでもない」 and other expressions that convey obviousness
  or certainty, consider the nuance. 「言うまでもない」 specifically suggests that something is so self-evident
  that it does not *require* mention, even if it is then mentioned for emphasis or to lead into a further
  point. It carries a subtle tone of 'this is so obvious, let's move on or acknowledge it as a given.'
  Expressions like 「もちろん」 and 「当然」 more directly state 'of course' or 'naturally,' asserting the truth
  rather than implying it is beyond the need for assertion. 「当たり前」 and other similar terms like 「明白」,
  「自明」, and 「明らか」 describe something as plain and clear, often based on common knowledge or evidence,
  but lack the nuance of being 'needless to say' in the same way as 「言うまでもない」. Finally, 「〜は言うまでもない」 functions
  similarly but attaches this 'needless to say' quality to a specific preceding topic.

        english: When I see your smile, nothing else is enough.
        hint: 「十分 だ」 means 'it's enough' or 'sufficient'. We're looking for a phrase that implies the
          speaker is so overwhelmed that words are rendered unnecessary, conveying a deeper emotional
          impact than mere sufficiency.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 君 の 笑顔 を 見る と、他 に 何 も {いら ない} よ。
        english: When I see your smile, I don't need anything else.
        hint: 「いらない」 means 'unnecessary' or 'don't need'. While related, we're looking for a phrase that
          specifically highlights that the emotion is so obvious and complete that no words are required
          to express it.
    scene: A young man, captivated by a woman's smile, conveys his deep affection without needing further
      words.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: This sentence expresses affection directly. The use of 「言うまでもない」 here implies the speaker
      is so captivated that words become unnecessary. The final particle 「よ」 adds a gentle but direct
      emphasis, typical in a male speaker's flirtatious comment to a female listener.
  - english: It goes without saying that Japanese cuisine, with its fresh ingredients, is incredibly healthy
      and delicious.
    japanese:
      - 新鮮 な 食材 を 使う 日本 料理 が、健康 的 で 美味しい の は {言う まで も ない}。
      - 新鮮 な 食材 を 使う 日本 料理 が、健康 的 で 美味しい の は {言う まで も ない} こと です。
    english_literally: Japanese cuisine that uses fresh ingredients, that it is healthy and delicious,
      is needless to say.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新鮮 な 食材 を 使う 日本 料理 が、健康 的 で 美味しい の は {当たり前} だ。
        english: It's natural that Japanese cuisine using fresh ingredients is healthy and delicious.
        hint: 「当たり前 だ」 states something as commonplace or self-evident, lacking the subtle emphasis of
          something being 'needless to say' because it's such a given.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新鮮 な 食材 を 使う 日本 料理 が、健康 的 で 美味しい の は {明白} だ。
        english: It's clear that Japanese cuisine using fresh ingredients is healthy and delicious.
        hint: 「明白 だ」 suggests clarity based on evidence or logic. We're looking for a phrase that conveys
          that the truth is so widely accepted it requires no assertion.
    scene: A chef is explaining the foundational principles of Japanese cuisine to a group of culinary
      students.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The phrase 「〜の は 言うまでもない」 emphasizes that the healthiness and deliciousness of Japanese food,
      when fresh ingredients are used, is a widely acknowledged and undeniable truth, especially in a
      professional context.
post_example_writeup: The use of 「ことだが」、「が」, or 「けど」 after 「言うまでもない」 adds subtle nuances. 「ことだが」 emphasizes
  the obviousness, 「が」 provides a soft emphasis, and 「けど」 softens the statement, often making it more
  personal or reflective. 「〜の は 言うまでもない」 is a common variation when the obvious point is a clause ending
  in 「の」.
