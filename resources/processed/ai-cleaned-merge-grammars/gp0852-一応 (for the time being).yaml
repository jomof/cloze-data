    "etymology": "The term 「一応」 is derived from 「一」 (ichi, meaning 'one') and 「応」 (ō, meaning 'response' or 'application'). The combination suggests a minimal or initial response or action, hence the meanings 'for the time being' or 'roughly'. It conveys a sense of doing something as a preliminary step or fulfilling a basic requirement.",
    "writeup": "「一応」 is an adverb that indicates that something is done as a preliminary measure, tentatively, or to fulfill a minimum requirement. It can be translated as \"more or less,\" \"for the time being,\" or \"roughly.\" It implies that while something may not be perfect or ideal, it meets the basic needs for the moment. It is often used to express that an action is being taken to satisfy a requirement, even if it's not the complete or final solution.\n\nWhen you use it, be aware of the two main senses of 「一応」: \n\n*   To mean \"more or less\" as a minimum\n*   To mean \"just in case.\"",
