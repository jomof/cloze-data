    "etymology": "The term 「一応」 is derived from 「一」 (ichi, meaning 'one') and 「応」 (ō, meaning 'response' or 'application'). The combination suggests a minimal or initial response or action, hence the meanings 'for the time being' or 'roughly'. It conveys a sense of doing something as a preliminary step or fulfilling a basic requirement.",
    "writeup": "「一応」 is an adverb used to indicate that an action or state is a preliminary measure, tentative, or done to fulfill a minimum requirement. It conveys the nuance that while something may not be perfect or ideal, it is sufficient for the current moment or meets a basic necessity. It can be translated as \"for the time being,\" \"more or less,\" or \"tentatively.\" This usage implies that an action is taken to satisfy an immediate requirement, even if it is not a complete or final solution.It is important to note that 「一応」 also has another distinct usage, meaning \"just in case\" or \"just to be sure,\" which implies a precautionary measure. This alternative meaning is discussed in the 'false_friends' section.",

            "nuance": "Unlike the current grammar point's meaning of 'for the time being' or 'more or less', 「一応」 in this sense emphasizes a precautionary measure rather than a temporary or minimal one. It suggests taking an action to prevent a potential problem.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference between the two meanings of 「一応」 lies in the intention behind the action. When it means 'just in case,' the action is taken as a precaution.
