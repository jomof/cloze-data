jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: formal
  usage-context: Formal and literary contexts.
etymology: たる is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb たり. たり itself is a contraction of
  the case marking particle と and あり (to be). This can be compared to なり, which is a contraction of に
  と あり.
writeup: '**たる** is an attributive form derived from the classical auxiliary verb **たり**, meaning ''to
  be'' or ''to exist''. This form indicates that something holds a specific role, qualification, or status.
  It is typically used in formal or literary contexts and often conveys a sense of inherent quality, responsibility,
  or expectation associated with that position. It can be translated as ''in the position of (A)'', ''as
  an (A)'', or ''one who is (A)''. Unlike the general copula である, **たる** places a strong emphasis on the
  qualifications, inherent nature, or responsibilities tied to the role being described, rather than merely
  stating a fact.When used as **たるに**, it forms a phrase meaning ''in the position of (A)'' or ''as an
  (A)'', emphasizing the capacity or role in which an action or state occurs. It typically appears after
  a noun designating a role, followed by a statement concerning that role.When combined with 者 (mono),
  forming **たる者** (**たるもの**), it specifically refers to ''a person in the position of (A)'' or ''one who
  is (A)''. This construction is used to describe what is appropriate or expected of someone holding that
  particular position. It can be translated as ''for'' or ''as'' in this context.Important ConsiderationsWhile
  **たる** relates to the suitability of something being in a specific position, do not confuse it with
  the u-verb 足る (tariru), which means ''to be sufficient'' or ''to be worthy''. Although semantically
  related in some contexts, their grammatical structures and primary usages differ.'
false_friends:
  - term: に足る
    meaning: To be worthy of, To be enough, To be sufficient
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike たる, に足る emphasizes the worthiness or sufficiency of something, rather than a position
      or role. It often describes whether something meets a required standard.
    grammar_point: に足る (worthy of)
  - term: として
    meaning: As (i.e. in the role of), For
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While として can also mean 'as' or 'in the role of', it is more general and does not carry the
      same strong nuance of inherent qualification, inherent responsibility, or expected behavior tied
      to a specific position or status that たる does. It often indicates a temporary or situational role.
    grammar_point: として (as)
  - term: としては
    meaning: As a, For a, As for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: としては is closer to 'as for' or 'regarding' something, often used to introduce a perspective
      or a specific condition. It does not imply the inherent qualities or expected behavior associated
      with a position or role in the same way as たる.
    grammar_point: としては (as a standard or viewpoint)
  - term: である
    meaning: Formal or literary だ, Authoritative, Copula
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: である is a formal way of saying 'is', but it doesn't carry the same nuance of inherent qualities,
      qualifications, or expected behavior associated with a position or role that たる does. It simply
      states a fact or identity.
    grammar_point: である (formal copula)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up these expressions, remember that たる is specifically used
  to describe the qualities, responsibilities, or expectations associated with a particular position or
  role, emphasizing an inherent suitability. に足る emphasizes worthiness or sufficiency, while としては and
  として are more general 'as' indicating a role or capacity, and であるは simply a formal way of stating 'is'
  without the added implications of qualification or expectation.

      this strong sense of obligation. The context of an older male politician advising a younger male

          that define the essence of being a diplomat.
    scene: A university professor discussing a promising student's career prospects.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: In 「外交官 たる 資格」, 'たる' directly modifies 資格 (qualification), emphasizing that her qualifications

      usage is common in formal and evaluative contexts, which is reflected in the academic setting and
      the professor's informative tone.

          We're looking for a statement about intrinsic principles.
    scene: A philosopher lecturing on ethics and non-violence.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The usage of 「平和 を 願う者 たる に」 establishes a fundamental characteristic – desiring peace – and
      then states what is utterly incompatible with it. 「暴力 は 決して 許されない」 (violence is absolutely unforgivable)
      highlights this absolute incompatibility. This expression is highly formal and categorical, appropriate
      for academic or philosophical discourse.

    scene: Observing a monarch during a state ceremony.
    register: formal

        hint: 「として」 indicates a general role, while 「たるもの」 emphasizes that protecting children is a fundamental,
          inherent duty that defines what it means to be a parent. We're looking for an essential parental
          responsibility.
    scene: A family therapist speaking to parents about their responsibilities.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The phrase 「親たるもの」 (one who is a parent/that which is a parent) explicitly articulates what
      is fundamentally expected and naturally inherent to the role of a parent. This construction, often
      followed by a moral or essential truth, conveys a strong sense of undeniable obligation or responsibility.
      This is a common way to state widely accepted truths within a specific role, used in formal and
      instructive settings.
    etymology: None relevant here that isn't already covered by the grammar point's etymology or the example's
      vocabulary.
post_example_writeup: The examples above demonstrate the nuance of 「たる」 in emphasizing inherent qualities,
  responsibilities, or expectations associated with a specific role or status. Notice how it implies a
  deeper, more intrinsic connection than simply stating a fact or acting in a temporary capacity. This
  is why it is often found in formal and prescriptive contexts.
