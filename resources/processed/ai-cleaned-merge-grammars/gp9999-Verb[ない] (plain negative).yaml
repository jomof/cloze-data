details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used for direct, plain negation of actions or states. Forms the basis for many other
    negative grammatical structures, and can be used to form polite negative expressions as well.
  function: Expresses that an action is not or will not be performed, or that a state does not exist.
  nuance: Implies a simple, factual absence of action or state without additional politeness or formality
    in its plain form. Can convey a strong, direct refusal depending on intonation. The polite forms (～ません,
    ～ませんでした) convey politeness without changing the core negative meaning.
  grammatical-role: Attaches to verb stems to create their negative forms, which can then be further conjugated
    or used in various grammatical structures.
etymology: The negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 evolved from the classical Japanese negative auxiliary 「ず」
  (later 「ぬ」). In the Heian period, 「ぬ」 became 「ない」 through a process of sound change, specifically through
  the conjunctive form 「なく」 which then developed into 「ない」 when used as a predicate. This historical link
  explains why 「ない」 behaves grammatically like an い-adjective, able to conjugate further (e.g., 「なかった」,
  「なくて」). Its fundamental meaning of "absence" or "non-existence" has remained consistent, forming the
  core of negation in modern Japanese. The polite form 「ません」 is derived from the negative conjugation
  of 「ます」, the polite auxiliary verb.
writeup: |-
  The plain negative form of verbs, ending in 「ない」, is a fundamental grammatical component in Japanese. It is used to express that an action is not being performed, will not be performed, or that a state does not exist. This form is central to casual speech and writing, and it also serves as a base for constructing many more complex grammatical expressions, including polite negations.

  Forming the plain negative depends on the verb group:
  *   **Godan Verbs (Group 1)**: For these verbs, the last character (which is in the う-column) is changed to its corresponding あ-column sound, and then 「ない」 is appended. For example, 読む (yomu, to read) becomes 読まない (yomanai, do not read). A special consideration is for verbs ending in 「う」 (e.g., 買う - kau, to buy), where 「う」 changes to 「わ」 before 「ない」 is added, making it 買わない (kawanai, do not buy). Another notable exception is 行く (iku, to go), which uniquely becomes 行かない (ikanai, do not go) instead of いかない.
  *   **Ichidan Verbs (Group 2)**: For Ichidan verbs, the process is simpler: the final 「る」 is dropped, and 「ない」 is directly attached. For example, 食べる (taberu, to eat) becomes 食べない (tabenai, do not eat).
  *   **Irregular Verbs**: The two irregular verbs, する (suru, to do) and 来る (kuru, to come), have unique negative forms: しない (shinai, do not do) and こない (konai, do not come), respectively.

  Because 「ない」 functions grammatically like an い-adjective, it can be conjugated further into forms like the past tense (なかった), the te-form (なくて), or for conditional statements (なければ, なかったら). Understanding this basic negative form is crucial for effective communication in Japanese, as it forms the basis for expressing inability, prohibition, and various nuances of negation, both casually and politely (using forms like 「ません」 and 「ませんでした」).
false_friends:
  - term: ないことには~ない
    meaning: Unless ~ will not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 'While both involve negation, 「ないことには~ない」 expresses a necessary condition: unless something
      happens, something else won''t happen. It''s a conditional negation, not a simple statement of non-action.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:~ないことには~ない (unless ~ will not)
  - term: てはいけない
    meaning: Must not; may not; cannot.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てはいけない」 expresses prohibition or a strong rule against doing something. In contrast, the
      plain negative 「ない」 simply states that an action is not done or will not be done, without implying
      prohibition.
    grammar_point: 〜てはいけない・〜てはならない (must not)
  - term: じゃない
    meaning: Is not, Isn't (for nouns and な-adjectives)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「じゃない」 is the plain negative form for nouns and な-adjectives, whereas the 「ない」 form discussed
      here is specifically for verbs. They negate different parts of speech.
    grammar_point: じゃない (negation noun and na-adj)
  - term: ざるを得ない
    meaning: Can't help doing, have no choice but to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expression conveys a sense of unavoidable necessity or compulsion to do something, despite
      possibly not wanting to. It's a much stronger, more complex nuance than a simple verb negation.
    grammar_point: ざるを得ない (have no choice but to)
  - term: ない
    meaning: there is no / not exist
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This 「ない」 is a completely different word. This grammar point modifies a verb to express its
      negation, while the other refers to non-existence. For example, 「猫 が いない」 (There is no cat) versus
      「猫 が 飲ま ない」 (The cat doesn't drink).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ない (non-existent)
  - term: ~ず
    meaning: without doing, not doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express a negative state, 「~ず」 or 「~ずに」 focuses on the absence of an action as
      a prerequisite or accompanying circumstance for another action, often translating to 'without doing
      X'. In contrast, the 「~ない」 form for verbs simply states that an action is not performed or will
      not be performed.
    grammar_point: ずに・ないで・ことなく (without doing)
  - term: まい
    meaning: won't, probably not, not going to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While this grammar point expresses general or habitual negation, 「まい」 conveys a strong negative
      volition or conjecture, similar to 'won't' or 'probably won't'. It carries a sense of determination
      or strong unlikelihood rather than a simple statement of non-action.
    grammar_point: まい (won't・probably not)
  - term: っこない
    meaning: no chance of, impossible
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This grammar point indicates that an action is not or will not be performed. In contrast,
      「っこない」 is a more emphatic expression of impossibility, meaning 'there's no way it will happen' or
      'it's impossible'. It's much stronger and more definitive than a simple negative.
    grammar_point: っこない (no chance of)
  - term: ~なくてもいい
    meaning: no need to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While the verb negative expresses that an action is not or will not be performed, 「~なくてもいい」
      indicates that there is no necessity or obligation to perform an action. It implies permission not
      to do something rather than simply stating non-performance.
    grammar_point: なくてもいい (no need to)
post_false_friends_writeup: It is important to distinguish the simple plain negative 「ない」 from other negative
  expressions that add layers of meaning like prohibition, necessity, or specific conditional relationships.
  While 「ない」 is a direct statement of non-action or non-existence, constructions like 「ないことには~ない」 and
  「てはいけない」 introduce conditions or commands. Also, be careful not to confuse verb negation with the negation
  of nouns and な-adjectives using 「じゃない」, as they apply to different word types. The choice depends on
  whether you are simply stating a fact, imposing a rule, or expressing compulsion. Additionally, the
  auxiliary verb 「ない」 used for negation should not be confused with the adjective 「ない」 meaning "non-existent";
  although they sound the same, their grammatical roles are distinct. Similarly, other negative expressions
  like 「~ず」, 「まい」, and 「っこない」 carry specific nuances of condition, volition, or impossibility that go
  beyond a simple statement of non-performance.

    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The male, older speaker uses 「読ま なけれ ば」 to convey a direct, logical consequence, typical of
      a parent instructing a child. The ending 「よ」 adds a gentle assertion, common when offering advice
      or stating a fact to someone younger. The alternative 「だろ」 (used in some variations) indicates a
      stronger, more masculine assertion, implying 'you know, right?' or 'don't you agree?'.

          - ここ で は クレジット カード の ご 利用 は でき ませ ん。
        english: Credit card usage is not possible here (more formal).

    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: Used to state a general rule or policy, often heard in professional settings to clearly communicate

          for a polite negative question form.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 来週 の パーティー で {歌い ます} か？
        english: Will you sing at the party next week? (direct polite question)
        hint: While grammatically correct, a direct question with 「~ますか」 can sometimes sound a bit blunt
          for an invitation. 「~ませ ん か」 softens the request and is a more common way to invite.
    scene: A person is inviting a friend or acquaintance to a social gathering.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    nuance: The phrase 「歌い ませ ん か？」 is a very common and polite way to extend an invitation or make a
      suggestion. By phrasing it as a negative question, it softens the request and gives the invitee
      an easier way to decline without feeling rude, implying 'Is there any reason you *wouldn't* come?'.

    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「行き たく ない なあ」 combines the negative desiderative form 「~たくない」 (don't want to) with
      the casual, self-reflective particle 「なあ」. This combination is common among younger speakers when
      expressing a personal feeling of reluctance or mild complaint, often to themselves or to close peers.
      「全然」 (zenzen) intensifies the negation, meaning 'not at all'.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 会議 で あまり {話し ませ ん}。
        english: He doesn't usually talk much in meetings (polite).
        hint: This example focuses on a casual observation of a habitual action. We're looking for the
          plain negative form.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 会議 で 全然 {しゃべら ない}。
        english: He doesn't talk at all in meetings (casual, informal verb).
        hint: While 「しゃべる」 is also an う-verb meaning 'to talk', 「話す」 is more common for formal or general
          'speaking'. This example uses a plain negative with a common verb for general talking.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a quiet team member.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The use of 「あまり ~ ない」 implies 'not very much' or 'not often'. This is a common construction
      for partial negation. 「話さ ない」 is the plain negative form of 「話す」 (hanasu), a common Godan verb.
      The structure allows for a casual observation between colleagues.
post_example_writeup: Remember that the negative form of verbs indicates "will not do", "do not do", or
  "cannot do", so the translation will depend on the context. Pay close attention to particles and sentence-final
  expressions, as they often convey additional nuance about the speaker's feelings or the relationship
  with the listener. Mastering these patterns is fundamental for forming negative sentences in Japanese,
  as the underlying principles apply to all verb types.
