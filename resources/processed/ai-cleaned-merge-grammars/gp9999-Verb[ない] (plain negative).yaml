    to わない.

details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  function: negation
  nuance: This form conveys basic, direct negation and is typically used in casual conversation. It serves
    as a foundational component for many other grammatical structures.
  grammatical-role: Modifies verbs to express non-performance of an action or non-existence of a state.
etymology: The negative auxiliary verb 「ない」is believed to have evolved from the classical Japanese negative
  auxiliary suffix 「ぬ」which can be traced to forms like 「ざる」and 「ぬ + あり」. Its adjectival conjugation patterns
  (e.g., 「ない」「なかった」「なくて」) reflect this historical linguistic development.
writeup: |-
  The plain negative form of Japanese verbs, commonly known as the 「ない」form, is a fundamental grammatical construction used to express that an action is not performed or a state does not exist. It is essential for building many other more complex grammatical patterns.

  Unlike English, where "not" simply precedes the verb, Japanese verbs undergo a morphological change to become negative. This change depends on the verb group.

  For **Group 1 verbs (五段動詞)**, which typically end in a う-sound before る (e.g., 読む (yomu), 買う (kau), 行く (iku)), the final kana is changed to its corresponding あ-column sound, and then 「ない」is attached. For example, 読む becomes 読まない (yomanai). A special case is verbs ending in う, which change to わない, such as 買う becoming 買わない (kawanai). The verb 行く (iku) is also a notable exception in Group 1, becoming 行かない (ikanai), not 行かない (ikunai).

  For **Group 2 verbs (一段動詞)**, which always end in いる or える (e.g., 食べる (taberu), 見る (miru)), the final る is simply dropped and 「ない」is attached. So, 食べる becomes 食べない (tabenai).

  There are also two **irregular verbs** to remember: する (suru, to do) becomes しない (shinai), and 来る (kuru, to come) becomes 来ない (konai).

   The 「ない」form is used in casual conversations among friends and family, and it serves as the base for many other grammatical structures such as informal requests (〜ないで `naide`), stating intentions (〜ないつもりだ `nai tsumori da`), and various conditional forms. Understanding and mastering the 「ない」form is crucial for progressing in Japanese grammar.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[ません] (polite negative)
    meaning: polite negative form of verbs
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express negation, 「ません」is the polite equivalent of 「ない」and is used in formal settings
      or when speaking to superiors or strangers. 「ない」is strictly casual.
    grammar_point: Verb[ません] (polite negative)
  - term: な-Adjective[ではない・じゃない] (plain negative)
    meaning: plain negative form of na-adjectives
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the negative form for な-adjectives, not verbs. Although it uses 「ない」at the end, the
      formation rule for the preceding part is different, and it applies to adjectives, not actions.
    grammar_point: な-Adjective[ではない・じゃない] (plain negative)
  - term: い-Adjective[くない] (negative)
    meaning: plain negative form of i-adjectives
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the negative form for い-adjectives, not verbs. It directly attaches 「ない」to the stem
      of the い-adjective after replacing the final い with く. For example, 良い (ii) becomes 良くない (yokunai).
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[くない] (negative)
  - term: 〜てはいけない・〜てはならない (must not)
    meaning: must not do, prohibited
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While this also expresses a negative action, it conveys prohibition or obligation not to do
      something, which is a stronger nuance than simple non-performance expressed by 「ない」.
    grammar_point: 〜てはいけない・〜てはならない (must not)
post_false_friends_writeup: It is important to distinguish the plain negative verb form 「ない」from other
  negative expressions or forms that merely contain 「ない」. While 「ません」is its polite counterpart, 「ではない」and
  「くない」are used for negating な-adjectives and い-adjectives, respectively, following different formation
  rules. Furthermore, constructions like 「〜てはいけない」express prohibition, a much stronger directive than
  a simple statement of non-action with the plain negative verb form. Pay close attention to the part
  of speech and the specific function to avoid confusion.

        english: I thought it probably wouldn't rain.
        hint: The casual phrasing of 'I didn't think it would rain' implies simple negation. The inclusion
          of 「だろう」adds a nuance of conjecture, which is not what we're demonstrating here.
    scene: Someone expresses mild surprise after unexpected rain starts.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, the 「ない」form is versatile and integrates directly
  into everyday casual Japanese. It can be used to state facts, describe habits, express personal decisions,
  or even form informal requests when combined with 「で」. Mastering its formation and usage across different
  verb types is key to expressing simple negation fluently.
