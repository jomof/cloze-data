details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express that something is not done to a satisfactory degree, often due to circumstances
    or inability. It is always followed by a verb in the negative form.
  function: To convey that an action is not carried out adequately or properly.
  nuance: Emphasizes the inadequacy or unsatisfactory nature of an action, implying a sense of failing
    or lacking. It can also imply a sense of negligence or inability.
  colocation: Often collocates with verbs related to daily activities, such as 食べる (to eat), 寝る (to sleep),
    勉強する (to study), 話す (to speak), 準備する (to prepare).
etymology: 「ろくに」 itself is an adverb that originally meant "sufficiently" or "adequately." However, when
  paired with 「ない」, it takes on the opposite meaning, indicating a lack of sufficiency.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「ろくに～ない」 indicates that something is **not done properly, sufficiently, or satisfactorily.** It is always used with a verb in its negative form. This phrase expresses that an action is performed poorly, inadequately, or hardly at all. It emphasizes a lack of proper execution or performance and can convey a sense of disappointment, regret, or even frustration about the quality or quantity of an action. It is frequently used in everyday conversation and writing.

  It implies that while an action might have been attempted, or some small amount of it might have been done, the quality or thoroughness was far below what is expected or necessary. For instance, 「ろくに寝ていない」 (rokuni nete inai) implies that one got some sleep, but it was not enough or not restful, leading to continued tiredness, rather than a complete lack of sleep.

  - term: 全然～ない
    meaning: not at all, never
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express negativity, 「ろくに～ない」 implies inadequacy or insufficiency, whereas 「全然～ない」
      indicates a complete absence.
    grammar_point: 全然 (not at all; totally)
  - term: ほとんど～ない
    meaning: hardly, scarcely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ほとんど～ない」 focuses on the quantity or frequency being very low, while 「ろくに～ない」 focuses on the
      quality or manner of the action being insufficient.
    grammar_point: ほとんど (almost all or hardly any)
  - term: あまり〜ない
    meaning: not very, not much
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あまり～ない」 suggests a low degree or infrequent occurrence, similar to 「ほとんど～ない」, but 「ろくに～ない」
      specifically points to a lack of properness or sufficiency in the action.
    grammar_point: あまり ない (not very or much)
  - term: 陸に〜ない
    meaning: Not well or properly, barely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「陸に〜ない」 (まともに〜ない) is a close synonym of 「ろくに〜ない」, also emphasizing a lack of properness or
      sufficiency, but it tends to be more formal and less commonly used in casual speech.
    grammar_point: 陸に〜ない (not properly)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「ろくに～ない」, 「全然～ない」, 「ほとんど～ない」, 「あまり～ない」, and 「陸に〜ない」 all express some form
  of negation, but they differ in nuance. Use 「ろくに～ない」 when you want to emphasize that something wasn't
  done properly or to a satisfactory degree, implying a failure in quality or thoroughness rather than
  a complete absence. Use 「全然～ない」 when you mean something wasn't done at all. 「ほとんど～ない」 is used when something
  was done very little or rarely, focusing on quantity. 「あまり～ない」 also indicates a low degree or infrequency,
  similar to 「ほとんど～ない」, but often implies a less extreme condition. 「陸に〜ない」 carries a very similar meaning
  and nuance to 「ろくに〜ない」, but is generally found in more formal contexts.
examples:
  - english: Recently, I've been too busy, so I haven't been exercising properly.
    japanese:
      - 最近、忙し すぎ て、{ろくに} 運動 し {て い ない}。
      - 最近、忙し すぎ て、{ろくに} 運動 し {て い ませ ん}。
      - 最近、忙し すぎ て、{ろくに} 運動 も し {て い ない}。

          - 最近、忙し すぎ て、全然 運動 し て い ない。
        english: Recently, I'm too busy, so I haven't exercised at all.
        hint: 「全然～ない」 emphasizes a complete lack or absence. We're looking for a situation where exercise
          might be attempted but isn't done well. Here, the emphasis is on the quality of exercise, not
          a total absence. This implies some effort, but insufficient results. We're looking for an inadequate
          action, not a non-existent one. Try again to match the nuance of 'not properly'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最近、忙し すぎ て、あまり 運動 し て い ない。
        english: Recently, I'm too busy, so I don't exercise much.
        hint: 「あまり～ない」 implies a low degree or infrequent occurrence. While similar, 「ろくに」 specifically
          points to a lack of properness or sufficiency in the action, not just its quantity. The nuance
          is about the *quality* of exercise (e.g., too short, not intense enough), not merely its infrequency.
          We're looking for the phrase that means the action was attempted but not done well, instead
          of just a little.
    scene: A busy professional lamenting their lack of physical activity and feeling out of shape.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The speaker uses 「～ていない」 to indicate a continuous state of not exercising. 「ろくに」 highlights
      that even if they attempted some exercise, it was not done adequately or properly due to their busy
      schedule, making it ineffective. This implies a lack of quality or thoroughness in the action rather
      than a complete absence. The use of 「運動」 can imply not just the act of exercising, but also the
      benefit or effect of exercise. Thus, 「ろくに運動していない」 means they haven't gotten sufficient or proper
      exercise to achieve their fitness goals. It's not that they don't do any exercise, but rather that
      what they do isn't good enough or doesn't feel sufficient for their needs. The male speaker's age
      adds a common context for someone balancing work and fitness. The casual register makes it suitable
      for a personal complaint. The serious setting reflects the genuine concern over health and fitness.
      The combination of 「忙しすぎて」 and 「ろくに」 emphasizes the external constraints preventing proper execution.
  - english: She couldn't even properly understand the lecture, no matter how hard she tried.

        english: She couldn't understand the lecture at all, no matter how hard she tried.
        hint: 「全然～ない」 implies a complete inability or lack of understanding. The original sentence with
          「ろくに」 suggests that she understood *some* parts, but not enough to grasp the lecture properly.
          This hints at inadequate understanding, not a total void. We're looking for an inability to
          do something *properly*, not a complete absence of the action. Try again to match the nuance
          of 'not properly'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は どんな に 頑張っ て も、講義 を あまり 理解 でき な かっ た。
        english: She didn't understand the lecture much, no matter how hard she tried.
        hint: 「あまり～ない」 indicates a low degree of understanding. While close, 「ろくに」 emphasizes that her
          understanding was *insufficient for the purpose* of the lecture, implying a failure to meet
          a standard, not just a low quantity. We're looking for insufficient understanding, not just
          a small amount. Try again to match the nuance of 'not properly'.
    scene: A university student reflecting on a particularly challenging lecture she attended.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「ろくに理解できなかった」 signifies that the speaker found the lecture so difficult that despite
      her efforts 「どんなに頑張っても」, she was unable to understand it to an adequate or satisfactory degree.
      It’s not that she understood absolutely nothing, but rather that her comprehension was insufficient
      for truly grasping the material. This highlights the struggle and the unsatisfactory outcome. The
      feminine speaker expresses a common frustration in an academic setting.

        english: Because my schedule is tight, I haven't eaten at all.
        hint: 「全然～ない」 means a complete lack of eating. The original sentence implies that the speaker
          might have eaten *something*, but it wasn't a proper, fulfilling meal. The focus is on the quality
          of the meal, not its total absence. We're looking for an inadequate action, not a non-existent
          one. Try again to match the nuance of 'not properly'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - スケジュール が きつい から、ほとんど 食事 を し て い ない。
        english: Because my schedule is tight, I've hardly eaten.
        hint: 「ほとんど～ない」 focuses on a very small quantity of eating. 「ろくに」 emphasizes that the meals, if
          any, were not sufficient or balanced, suggesting a qualitative inadequacy rather than just a
          quantitative one. We're looking for insufficient nourishment, not just a small amount. Try again
          to match the nuance of 'not properly'.
    scene: Someone explaining their stressful work situation to a sympathetic colleague during a brief
      break.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: This example emphasizes the difficulty of maintaining basic needs due to an intense schedule.
      「ろくに食事もしていない」 implies that any eating done was hurried, unhealthy, or simply not enough, failing
      to meet the standard of a 'proper meal.' It conveys a feeling of exhaustion and neglect of personal
      well-being. The casual register and serious setting highlight the common struggle of work-life balance.

        english: They haven't talked at all recently.
        hint: 「全然～ない」 implies a complete lack of communication. The original sentence suggests that some
          minimal interaction might occur, but it lacks depth or true communication. We're looking for
          inadequate communication, not a total absence. Try again to match the nuance of 'not properly'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 ら は 最近、あまり 話 し て い ない。
        english: They haven't talked much recently.
        hint: 「あまり～ない」 means they haven't talked frequently. However, 「ろくに」 focuses on the *quality* of
          their conversations—they aren't meaningful or substantial. We're looking for poor quality of
          interaction, not just infrequency. Try again to match the nuance of 'not properly'.
    scene: A friend observing a strained relationship between two mutual acquaintances.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「ろくに話もしていない」 conveys that while the couple might exchange brief greetings or functional
      sentences, they haven't had any substantial or meaningful conversations. This suggests a deterioration
      in the quality of their relationship. The female speaker here uses a common phrasing to express
      concern about the state of a relationship, reflecting a typical observation among friends.

        english: My old laptop won't start up at all anymore.
        hint: 「全然～ない」 implies a complete failure to start. The original sentence suggests that the laptop
          *might* sometimes start, but it's unreliable or takes an extremely long time, meaning it doesn't
          function *properly*. We're looking for an unreliable action, not a non-existent one. Try again
          to match the nuance of 'not properly'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 古い パソコン は もう ほとんど 起動 し な い。
        english: My old laptop hardly starts up anymore.
        hint: 「ほとんど～ない」 focuses on the infrequency of starting. 「ろくに」 implies that even if it starts,
          it might crash immediately or perform poorly, making the startup process inadequate for use.
          We're looking for a poor quality startup, not just infrequency. Try again to match the nuance
          of 'not properly'.
    scene: Someone frustrated with their failing technology, trying to turn on an old computer.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: Here, 「ろくに起動しない」 means the laptop's startup process is no longer reliable or efficient. It
      might boot very slowly, freeze frequently, or not get to a usable state, indicating a lack of *proper*
      functionality rather than a complete inability to boot at all. The male speaker's casual frustration
      is a common sentiment when dealing with old electronics.

        hint: 「全然～ない」 means earning absolutely no money for living expenses. The original sentence implies
          that some money *is* earned, but it's insufficient to cover basic needs properly. We're looking
          for an inadequate amount, not a total absence. Try again to match the nuance of 'not properly'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - アルバイト で は ほとんど 生活 費 を 稼げ ない。
        english: With my part-time job, I can hardly earn living expenses.
        hint: 「ほとんど～ない」 focuses on a very small quantity of earnings. 「ろくに」 emphasizes that the amount
          earned is not enough to live *properly* or comfortably, highlighting the inadequacy in relation
          to the necessity. We're looking for insufficient income for proper living, not just a small
          amount. Try again to match the nuance of 'not properly'.
    scene: A college student complaining to a friend about their financial struggles and the low pay of
      their part-time job.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「ろくに生活費も稼げない」 illustrates that the income from the part-time job is not enough to cover basic
      living costs adequately. It conveys a feeling of financial strain and the inability to live a 'proper'
      life due to insufficient funds. The example shows the potential form of the verb with 「ろくに」. This
      reflects a common concern for younger people navigating independence.

        english: He didn't prepare much for the presentation.

          of preparation, not just a small amount. Try again to match the nuance of 'not properly'.
    scene: A colleague observing someone's poor performance during a business presentation, reflecting
      on the reason.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The phrase 「ろくにできなかった」 here points to the insufficient or inadequate nature of the preparation.
      It implies that the preparation was not thorough or effective enough to lead to a successful outcome,
      highlighting a qualitative failure. The formal register suits a workplace observation, and the speaker's
      internal reflection on the reason for the poor performance. This is a common phrase in a professional
      setting when discussing work quality.

      playing has not reached a satisfactory or 'proper' level. It suggests that while they can produce
      some sound, they lack proficiency or skill. This is a common self-deprecating sentiment among learners
      of any art. The female speaker's personal reflection emphasizes the disappointment.

    nuance: 「ろくに眠れなかった」 indicates that the sleep obtained was of poor quality – perhaps light, disturbed,
      or insufficient – so it did not fulfill the purpose of proper rest. This is a common way to express
      suffering from insomnia or anxiety-induced sleep issues. The female speaker shares a vulnerable
      sentiment with her friend.
  - english: My child doesn't even properly clean up their toys after playing.
    japanese:
      - うち の 子 は おもちゃ を {ろくに} 片付け {な い}。
      - うち の 子 は おもちゃ を {ろくに} 片付け {ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Our child, toys, doesn't properly tidy up.

      - competing_japanese:
          - うち の 子 は おもちゃ を 全然 片付け な い。
        english: My child doesn't clean up their toys at all.
        hint: 「全然～ない」 implies a complete refusal or failure to tidy up. The original sentence suggests
          that the child might move some toys, but not in an organized or complete manner, meaning they
          don't clean up *properly*. We're looking for inadequate tidying, not a total absence. Try again
          to match the nuance of 'not properly'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - うち の 子 は おもちゃ を ほとんど 片付け な い。
        english: My child hardly cleans up their toys.
        hint: 「ほとんど～ない」 focuses on the infrequent tidying of toys. 「ろくに」 emphasizes that even when the
          child attempts to tidy, the result is messy or incomplete, implying a qualitative failure in
          the task. We're looking for poor quality tidying, not just infrequency. Try again to match the
          nuance of 'not properly'.
    scene: A parent humorously complaining about their child's messiness to another parent.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous

    nuance: 「ろくに片付けない」 is a common parental complaint, meaning the child either leaves things scattered
      or tidies them very poorly, not to a satisfactory standard. It implies a lack of thoroughness in
      the action. The humorous setting makes it relatable, and the female speaker's casual complaint is
      typical among parents discussing their children.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「ろくに～ない」 is versatile and can be used with various verbs
  in their negative forms to express that an action, state, or quantity is unsatisfactory or inadequate.
  It often carries a nuance of something being lacking despite expectations or attempts. This grammar
  point particularly useful for expressing frustration, disappointment, or a sense of failure in achieving
  a desired level of quality or sufficiency. It often suggests a gap between what was desired or expected
  and what was actually achieved, usually with a negative emotional tone from the speaker.
