    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 originally indicated location or direction. Over time, it expanded to mark other relationships, including the agent or source in passive, causative, and receiving constructions. This usage highlights 「に」's function of indicating a connection or relationship between elements in a sentence.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 indicates the agent performing an action in passive sentences, the person being made to do something in causative sentences, or the source from which something is received. It's commonly used with passive verbs to specify who performed the action, with causative verbs to show who is being made to do something, and with verbs of receiving like 「もらう」 to specify the giver. Verbs such as 習う (narau - to learn), 教わる (osowaru - to be taught), and 借りる (kariru - to borrow) also often use 「に」 to indicate the source from which the action is received.",
