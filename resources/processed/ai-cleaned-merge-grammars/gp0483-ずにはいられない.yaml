    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずにはいられない」 is composed of 「ず」 (a somewhat archaic negative auxiliary verb similar to 「ない」), the particle 「に」, the contrastive particle 「は」, and the potential form of 「いる」 in the negative, 「いられない」. Literally, it means \"cannot be without doing [something]\", which evolves into the meaning of \"cannot help but do [something]\" or \"cannot resist doing [something]\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ずにはいられない」 expresses that one **cannot help** but do something or **cannot resist** doing something. It's a relatively formal expression. The 「ず」 is an older, somewhat literary, equivalent of 「ない」. You'll often see it in set phrases. To form this grammar, you attach 「ずにはいられない」 to the stem form of a verb (the same form you use when conjugating to the 「ない」 form). For the verb 「する」, a special consideration must be made: it conjugates to 「せず」, not 「しず」.\n\nWhile 「ずにはいられない」 is often translated as 'cannot resist (A)', its literal meaning is simply 'cannot be without (A)', highlighting an internal, irresistible compulsion.",
