    "etymology": "This grammar point is built from the archaic negative auxiliary verb 「ず」, the particle 「には」, and the potential form of 「いる」 (居る or 要る) in the negative 「いられない」. The literal sense is something like, \"Without doing X, I cannot exist/continue.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ずにはいられない」 expresses the idea that one cannot help but do something, or cannot resist doing something. It's a fairly formal expression. As the original explanation says, 「ず」 is an older negative auxiliary verb, similar to 「ない」, but mostly found in set phrases these days. The 「には」 part emphasizes the 「ず」. 「いられない」 is the potential form of 「いる」 (to exist, to be) in the negative. So, you're saying you can't 'not do' something; you are compelled to do it. It attaches to the stem form of verbs. Keep in mind that the stem form of 「する」 is 「せ」 when used with 「ず」, hence 「せずにはいられない」.",
