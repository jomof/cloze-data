        "usage-context": "Often used in formal or literary contexts, conveying a strong, uncontrollable internal compulsion or emotional state. It implies that the action or feeling is deeply ingrained or inevitable given the circumstances."
    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「ずにはいられない」 is rooted in classical Japanese grammar. 「ず」 is an archaic negative auxiliary verb, serving a similar function to the modern 「ない」. It attaches to the Mizenkei (indeterminate form) of verbs. The particle 「に」 indicates a result or state, while 「は」 adds emphasis or contrast, similar to its modern function as a topic marker. 「いられない」 is the negative potential form of the verb 「いる」 (to be/exist), literally meaning 'cannot exist'. Thus, the combination literally translates to \"cannot exist without doing [something]\", or \"cannot be without doing [something]\". Over time, this evolved into the contemporary meaning of expressing an irresistible urge or an action that one simply cannot refrain from performing.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ずにはいられない」 conveys a strong, internal compulsion to do something or to feel a certain way, suggesting that the action or emotion is unavoidable for the speaker. It is typically used for involuntary actions or overwhelming feelings that are difficult to control.\n\n**Formation:** It attaches to the negative stem of verbs (the same stem used for the ない form). For most verbs, this is straightforward (e.g., 食べる → 食べずにはいられない). However, for the irregular verb する, it conjugates to せずにはいられない, not しずにはいられない.\n\n**Nuance:** While often translated as \"cannot help but do\" or \"cannot resist doing,\" the literal meaning is \"cannot be without doing.\" This highlights that the speaker's state or existence is intertwined with the action or feeling, making it impossible to omit. It emphasizes an internal, personal experience, rather than an external obligation or logical necessity.\n\n**Usage:** This expression tends to be more formal or literary compared to other similar phrases, and you will often encounter it in written Japanese or more deliberate speech. It describes a psychological state where one is powerless to prevent a certain action or emotion from occurring.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ないわけにはいかない」 implies an external necessity or social obligation, meaning one 'must' do something. In contrast, 「ずにはいられない」 describes an internal, irresistible urge or compulsion."

            "nuance": "「てしょうがない」 emphasizes the degree of a feeling or state to an overwhelming extent (e.g., 'so tired I can't stand it'). While it can express an uncontrollable feeling, it doesn't directly imply an *action* one cannot resist performing, unlike 「ずにはいられない」."

            "nuance": "「ずに」 is simply a negative conjunction meaning 'without doing X'. It is a component of 「ずにはいられない」 but does not carry the meaning of internal compulsion on its own. Confusing the two would omit the 'cannot help' nuance."

            "nuance": "Similar to 「てしょうがない」, 「てたまらない」 indicates an overwhelming feeling or desire. However, it focuses more on an uncontrollable *want* or *emotion* rather than an irresistible *action*, which is the core of 「ずにはいられない」."

            "nuance": "「ないではいられない」 is very similar in meaning and usage to 「ずにはいられない」. However, 「ずにはいられない」 is generally considered slightly more formal or literary, while 「ないではいられない」 might feel marginally more conversational."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「てならない」 often expresses a spontaneous or natural feeling that one feels strongly about. It is more about a feeling growing to an intense degree (e.g., 'I feel so sorry') and less about an action one cannot resist performing, distinguishing it from 「ずにはいられない」."

            "nuance": "「ざるを得ない」 signifies that one has no choice but to do something due to external circumstances or logical necessity. This contrasts with 「ずにはいられない」, which emphasizes an internal, personal compulsion or irresistible urge."

            "nuance": "「わけにはいかない」 indicates that something cannot be done due to social rules, common sense, or a moral imperative. It's about what is permissible or possible, not about an internal, uncontrollable urge to perform an action, differentiating it from 「ずにはいられない」."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between 「ずにはいられない」 and similar expressions, consider the nature of the compulsion. Use 「ずにはいられない」 when the driving force is an internal, irresistible urge or an overwhelming emotion that makes an action or feeling unavoidable. For external obligations or logical necessities, consider expressions like 「ないわけにはいかない」 or 「ざるを得ない」。 If you are simply emphasizing the extreme degree of a feeling, 「てしょうがない」, 「てたまらない」, or 「てならない」 might be more appropriate. Remember that 「ないではいられない」 is a very close alternative, though slightly less formal.",
