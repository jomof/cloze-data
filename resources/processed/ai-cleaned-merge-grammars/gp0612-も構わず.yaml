        "[Noun] + も構わず": "Indicates disregarding or not caring about the noun.",

        "[い-adjective] + の + も構わず": "Indicates doing something without worrying about the described quality.",

    "etymology": "The grammar point 「も構わず」 combines 「も」 (a particle indicating \"also\" or \"even\"), 「構う」 (kamau, meaning \"to mind\" or \"to care about\"), and 「ず」 (zu, a literary auxiliary verb similar to 「ない」, indicating negation). Therefore, it literally means \"without minding\" or \"without caring about.\"",
    "writeup": "「も構わず」 is used to express that someone does something without regard for a particular concern or consequence. It combines 「も」, the verb 「構う」 meaning \"to mind\" or \"to care\", and the literary auxiliary verb 「ず」, which functions similarly to 「ない」. Common translations include \"without worrying about (A), (B)\" and \"without minding (A), (B)\".\n\nIt can follow nouns directly or verbs, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives (with the addition of 「の」 after verbs and い-adjectives, and 「な + の」 after な-adjectives). 「にも構わず」 can also be used for added emphasis. It's used to show that the speaker is ignoring or not concerned about (A), and the (B) part highlights what is being done without considering (A). 「構う」 itself means \"to brace\" or \"to give pause\", so 「も構わず」 indicates a lack of hesitation or concern.",

                    "mitigation": "While 「～を気にせずに」 (ki ni sezu ni) also expresses \"without minding,\" the scene highlights a strong, almost defiant disregard. 「も構わず」 emphasizes this intentional and active lack of concern, making it more suitable for conveying a parent's frustration over their child's heedlessness, whereas 「気にせずに」 can imply a more passive state of not being bothered."

                    "mitigation": "「～のに」 (no ni) means \"even though\" and implies a contrast or surprising fact, but not necessarily a conscious disregard. The scene emphasizes the subject's determination *despite* the challenge, for which 「も構わず」 is better suited as it highlights their active dismissal of the difficulty to achieve their goal."

However, 「も構わず」 often implies a more emotional or instinctive disregard, fitting the heroic, spur-of-the-moment act of rescuing a drowning cat where one might not *think* to consider the danger but rather act without concern. 「顧みず」 can sound more deliberate or formal."
