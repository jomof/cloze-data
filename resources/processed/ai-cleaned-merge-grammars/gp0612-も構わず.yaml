    "etymology": "The grammar point 「も構わず」 combines 「も」 (a particle indicating 'also' or 'even'), 「構う」 (kamau, meaning 'to mind' or 'to care about'), and 「ず」 (zu, a literary auxiliary verb similar to 「ない」, indicating negation). Therefore, it literally means 'without minding' or 'without caring about.'",
    "writeup": "「も構わず」 is used to express that someone does something without regard for a particular concern or consequence. It combines 「も」, the verb 「構う」 meaning 'to mind' or 'to care', and the literary auxiliary verb 「ず」, which functions similarly to 「ない」. Common translations include 'without worrying about (A), (B)' and 'without minding (A), (B)'.\n\nIt can follow nouns directly or verbs, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives. After verbs and い-adjectives, 「の」 is often used, while after な-adjectives, 「な + の」 is used. Occasionally, 「にも構わず」 can be used instead of 「も構わず」 for added emphasis, particularly after nouns or i-adjectives. This structure is used to show that the speaker is ignoring or not concerned about (A), and the (B) part highlights what is being done without considering (A). The root verb 「構う」 itself means 'to brace' or 'to give pause', so 「も構わず」 indicates a lack of hesitation or concern, often in the face of something that would typically cause hesitation or concern.",

            "nuance": "While very similar, 「も構わず」 implies a stronger, often more active or defiant disregard, suggesting an intentional dismissal of something. 「気にせずに」 can be more neutral, indicating a lack of bother rather than an active disregard."

            "nuance": "「～を顧みず」 is quite similar in meaning but often sounds more formal or literary. 「も構わず」 can be used in a broader range of contexts, including more casual ones, and sometimes implies a more emotional or impulsive disregard."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「～にもかかわらず」 is also similar, indicating an action happens despite a certain condition. However, 「も構わず」 specifically focuses on the lack of concern or disregard by the subject for that condition, while 「～にもかかわらず」 can be more objective, stating the fact of something happening regardless of a condition."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference among these expressions often lies in the degree of active disregard. 「も構わず」 tends to imply a more deliberate or even defiant choice to ignore something, whereas alternatives might suggest a more passive lack of concern or simply a contrast between two facts.",
