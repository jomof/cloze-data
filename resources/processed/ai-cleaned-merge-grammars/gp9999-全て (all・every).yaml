etymology: The term 全て (subete) combines the kanji 全 (zen), meaning 'all' or 'whole,' with a nominalizing
  suffix or particle て. Historically, this combination evolved to represent the concept of 'the entirety'
  or 'everything' within a given context. The underlying idea is a complete and exhaustive inclusion,
  stemming from the sense of 'whole' or 'complete' inherent in 全.
writeup: |-
  全て (subete) is a versatile word in Japanese that can function as a noun, meaning 'everything,' or as an adverb, meaning 'completely' or 'entirely.' It is used to convey a sense of totality or comprehensiveness. While often interchangeable with similar words like 全部, 全て generally carries a slightly more formal or literary tone, and can refer to abstract concepts or non-countable things more fluidly.

  When used as a noun, 全て refers to 'all things' or 'the entirety.' For example, あなたの全てを愛している (Anata no subete o aishiteiru) means 'I love everything about you.' Here, it encapsulates all aspects of a person, not just physical items.

  As an adverb, 全て modifies verbs to indicate that an action is performed completely or entirely. For instance, 全てを話した (Subete o hanashita) means 'I told everything' or 'I spoke completely.' In this context, it emphasizes the exhaustive nature of the action.

  It is a common word in various registers, from formal speeches to everyday conversation, although in casual spoken Japanese, 全部 or みんな might be encountered more frequently, especially for concrete collections of things. Understanding the nuances allows for more precise and natural expression.

  - term: 全部
    meaning: all, whole, entire
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 全部 (zenbu) typically refers to 'the whole lot,' 'the entire amount,' or 'all of a defined
      group.' It often emphasizes the physical completeness or numerical totality of concrete items, or
      a specific portion that is entirely included. While interchangeable with 全て in many contexts, 全部
      is generally more common in casual speech and tends to imply a collection of discrete parts.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:全部 (all・whole)
  - term: 皆
    meaning: everyone, all (people)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 皆 (minna, or mina) specifically refers to 'all people' or 'everyone.' It is used exclusively
      for animate beings, whereas 全て can refer to people, objects, or abstract concepts.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:皆 (everyone・all)
  - term: あらゆる
    meaning: every conceivable kind of, all sorts of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: あらゆる (arayuru) is a prenominal adjective (連体詞) that modifies a noun, meaning 'every possible'
      or 'all kinds of,' implying a wide variety and comprehensiveness of types. It emphasizes the exhaustive
      *range* or *variety* of something, rather than the totality of a single entity or set as 全て often
      does.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:あらゆる (every・all sorts of)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 全て, 全部, 皆, and あらゆる can all be translated as 'all' or 'every' in English,
  their specific uses differ. 全て is the most encompassing, able to apply to concrete and abstract things
  as a noun or adverb, often with a slightly formal nuance. 全部 focuses more on the physical totality of
  a set. 皆 is strictly for people. あらゆる acts as an adjective to emphasize 'all kinds' or 'every possible
  type' of something. Choosing the correct word depends on whether you are referring to the totality of
  something, a complete set of physical items, a group of people, or a comprehensive range of varieties.
