        "function": "To express that something is understandable or reasonable.",
        "nuance": "Implies an understanding and acceptance of the reasons behind something, even if one doesn't necessarily agree with the outcome itself. It suggests that, given the circumstances, the result was predictable or logical.",

    "etymology": "The grammar point 「のももっともだ」 is composed of several elements: 「の」, a nominalizer turning a phrase into a noun; 「も」, a particle indicating 'also' or 'even'; and 「もっとも」, a な-adjective meaning 'reasonable' or 'plausible'. 「だ」 is the auxiliary verb 'to be'. Thus, the expression literally means 'it is reasonable that...'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「のももっともだ」 combines 「の」, 「も」, the な-adjective 「もっとも」 (meaning \"reasonable\" or \"plausible\"), and the auxiliary verb 「だ」. It indicates that something is understandable or reasonable. Think of it as affirming the logic behind a situation, whether or not you personally agree with it. It translates to \"it's only natural that...\", \"no wonder...\", \"have good reason to...\", or \"may well...\". It's used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. When connecting to verbs (plain form) and い-adjectives (plain form), 「の」 is used before 「ももっともだ」. When connecting to a な-adjective stem, 「な」 is used before 「の」. When connecting to nouns, the nominalizer 「の」 is dropped, and the noun typically connects directly with a particle like 「も」 or 「は」 before 「もっともだ」. It often appears with explanatory phrases like 「から」 or 「ので」.",
