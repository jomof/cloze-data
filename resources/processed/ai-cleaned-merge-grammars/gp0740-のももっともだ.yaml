    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the explanatory particle 「の」, the additive particle 「も」, the な-adjective 「もっとも」 (meaning 'reasonable' or 'plausible'), and the copula 「だ」. The combination expresses that something is reasonable or understandable given the circumstances.",
    "writeup": "「のももっともだ」 is used to express that something is understandable or to be expected, given the circumstances. It conveys a sense of agreement with the underlying reasons behind a situation or action. 「もっとも」 itself means \"reasonable\" or \"plausible,\" indicating that the speaker understands and accepts the logic behind something, regardless of their personal agreement. It's similar to saying \"it may well be\" in English. Commonly used with verbs, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives, it emphasizes the natural consequence of a situation. Phrases like 「から」 or 「ので」 often accompany this grammar point to provide further explanation.",
