        "[Verb (plain form)] + のももっともだ": "Indicates that something is understandable or reasonable due to the preceding action or state.",

    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「のももっともだ」 is composed of several elements: 「の」, a nominalizer turning a phrase into a noun; 「も」, a particle indicating 'also' or 'even'; and 「もっとも」, a な-adjective meaning 'reasonable' or 'plausible'. 「だ」 is the auxiliary verb 'to be'. Thus, the expression literally means 'it is reasonable that...'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「のももっともだ」 combines 「の」, 「も」, the な-adjective 「もっとも」 (meaning \"reasonable\" or \"plausible\"), and the auxiliary verb 「だ」. It indicates that something is understandable or reasonable. Think of it as affirming the logic behind a situation, whether or not you personally agree with it.\n\n*   It translates to \"it's only natural that...\", \"no wonder...\", \"have good reason to...\", or \"may well...\"\n*   It's used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns.\n    *   When connecting to verbs (plain form) and い-adjectives (plain form), 「の」 is used before 「ももっともだ」.\n    *   When connecting to a な-adjective stem, 「な」 is used before 「の」.\n    *   When connecting to nouns, the nominalizer 「の」 is dropped, and the noun typically connects directly with a particle like 「も」 or 「は」 before 「もっともだ」.\n*   It often appears with explanatory phrases like 「から」 or 「ので」.",
