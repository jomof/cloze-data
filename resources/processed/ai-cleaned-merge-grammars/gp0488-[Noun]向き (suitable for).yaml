id: gp0488
meaning: suitable for; intended for; aimed at
pronunciation:
  katakana: ムキ
  romaji: muki
formation:
  '[Noun] + 向き': Indicates that something is suitable for or oriented towards the specified noun.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The term 「向き」 (muki) literally means 'direction' or 'facing.' It is derived from the verb 「向く」
  (muku), meaning 'to face,' 'to turn towards,' or 'to be suited for.' Over time, its meaning evolved
  to encompass the idea of something being 'oriented towards' or 'suitable for' a specific purpose, person,
  or situation. This concept of inherent direction or orientation gives rise to the nuance of natural
  suitability rather than just a superficial match.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「〜向き」 (muki) attaches to nouns to indicate that something is **suitable for**, **intended for**, or **aimed at** the preceding noun. It suggests an inherent characteristic or a natural fit, implying that the item or situation possesses qualities that make it particularly appropriate for the given context. For instance, if something is 「子供向き」 (kodomo muki), it means it is inherently well-suited for children, perhaps due to its design, safety features, or content. This differs subtly from simply being 'for' children; it implies a natural alignment.

  「〜向き」 can modify another noun (e.g., 「初心者向きの教科書」 - a textbook suitable for beginners) or stand alone as a predicate (e.g., 「この仕事は彼向きだ」 - This job is suited for him). When used as a predicate, it functions as a na-adjective.

  It is a versatile expression used in various contexts, from describing products and services to personal attributes or situations. It carries a nuance of natural compatibility or design purpose, making it a strong choice when you want to convey that something is an excellent fit for a particular audience or scenario.

    grammar_point: に合わせる・に合う (match or fit)
  - term: に適する
    meaning: to be suitable for; to be appropriate for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「向き」 is a more concise and often more casual way to express inherent suitability. 「に適する」 is
      a more formal verb phrase, frequently used in objective, official, or technical contexts to describe
      suitability based on specific criteria or standards.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:に適する (to be suitable for)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「向き」, 「向け」, 「に合う」, and 「に適する」 all relate to suitability, distinguishing
  their nuances is key. 「向き」 often describes a natural or inherent fit due to existing qualities. 「向け」
  highlights intentional design or targeting by someone. 「に合う」 is about a specific match or fit, often
  discovered. 「に適する」 is a more formal expression for objective appropriateness. Choose 「向き」 when emphasizing
  natural aptitude or inherent suitability, especially in descriptive contexts for products, jobs, or
  personal characteristics.
