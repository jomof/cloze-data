jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General
  function: Indicates suitability or direction/orientation for something.
  nuance: Implies a natural inclination or inherent appropriateness, often suggesting something is 'facing'
    or 'suited' to a situation by its nature or circumstances, rather than being intentionally designed
    or created for it. This contrasts with '向け', which implies specific design or intent.
  grammatical-role: Used as a suffix to nouns to describe inherent qualities or direction.
  logical-flow: Connects a noun to its inherent suitability or orientation.
  temporal-flow: Can describe a trend or state that changes over time (e.g., 上向き - upward trend).
etymology: The word 「向き」 (muki) comes from the intransitive verb 「向く」 (muku), which means "to face." Thus,
  「向き」 retains the core meaning of direction or orientation. Its use as a suffix evolved to indicate suitability
  by implying that something naturally "faces" or is inclined towards a particular purpose or audience.
writeup: The noun 「向き」 (muki) is frequently used as a suffix in Japanese. It stems from the intransitive
  verb 「向く」 (muku), meaning "to face." This usage allows it to indicate that something is "facing (A)"
  or is "suitable for (A)." Since 「向き」 is derived from an intransitive verb, it typically suggests that
  an item or situation is naturally oriented or suited to something, or that it became so by chance. This
  often conveys a sense of inherent appropriateness or a natural inclination, rather than a deliberate
  design. For instance, saying 「子供向きの本」 (kodomo muki no hon) means "a book suitable for children." This
  implies the book's content or style naturally fits children, not necessarily that it was specifically
  written for them (though it might have been). **Contrast with 向け (muké):** It is crucial to distinguish
  「向き」 from 「向け」 (muké). 「向け」 comes from the transitive verb 「向ける」 (mukeru), which means "to turn something
  towards" or "to aim something at." Consequently, 「向け」 strongly implies that something was **specifically
  designed**, **intended for**, or **aimed at** a particular audience or purpose. For example, 「子供向けの本」
  (kodomo muké no hon) would more strongly suggest "a book intended/designed for children." In summary,
  「向き」 emphasizes natural suitability or orientation, while 「向け」 emphasizes specific design or intent.

  - term: に向かって
    meaning: Towards (physical direction)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に向かって」 emphasizes physical movement or orientation towards a specific destination or point.
      In contrast to 「向き」, which describes a static facing or inherent suitability, 「に向かって」 implies active
      motion or a trajectory towards something.
    grammar_point: に向かって (physical direction)
  - term: に向けて
    meaning: Aiming at, Intended for (purpose)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に向けて」 implies aiming or directing something towards a particular purpose, audience, or goal.
      Unlike 「向き」, which conveys natural suitability or general orientation, 「に向けて」 specifically highlights
      the intent or design behind an action or object.
    grammar_point: に向けて (aim and purpose)
  - term: ため(に)
    meaning: For, For the sake of, In order to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ため(に)」 indicates purpose or reason, while 「向き」 indicates suitability or direction. They are
      not interchangeable. 「子供のために」 means 'for the sake of children', implying a beneficiary or goal,
      while 「子供向き」 means 'suitable for children', implying a natural fit. 「ため(に)」 can often be used to
      express an intention or specific purpose, which is closer to 「向け」 than to 「向き」's natural suitability.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary・Nounの]ために (for the purpose of)'
  - term: 向け
    meaning: Intended for, Aimed at
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「向け」 implies something is designed specifically for a certain audience or purpose (derived
      from transitive verb 向ける), while 「向き」 implies suitability or a natural inclination (derived from
      intransitive verb 向く). This is the most crucial distinction, with 向け focusing on intent/design and
      向き on inherent appropriateness/orientation.
    grammar_point: 向け (intended for)
  - term: に合わせる・に合う
    meaning: In accordance with, Matching, Fitting, Suitable for, Adjust or tune to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に合わせて/に合った」 emphasizes alignment or conformity (e.g., 'tailored to' or 'fitted for'), often
      implying an pragmatic adjustment to meet certain conditions. 「向き」 focuses on inherent suitability
      or a natural direction/orientation, without necessarily implying an active effort to match something.
    grammar_point: に合わせる・に合う (match or fit)
  - term: 方向
    meaning: general direction, way
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「方向」 is a general term for 'direction' or 'way,' often used for travel or abstract paths.
      Unlike 「向き」, it doesn't typically imply suitability or the exact facing of an object. 「向き」 refers
      to the precise way something is facing.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:方向 (direction)
  - term: 方
    meaning: direction, person, method
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「方」 can refer to a 'direction' or a 'way of doing something,' and as an honorific for 'person.'
      It is much broader and less precise than 「向き」 for indicating an exact facing, and doesn't carry
      the 'suitability' nuance.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:方 (direction・person・method)
  - term: ～用
    meaning: for use by
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～用」 indicates something is specifically 'for use by' a certain group or for a certain purpose.
      While similar to 「向き」 in targeting, 「向き」 often describes a general suitability or appropriateness,
      whereas 「～用」 implies a designated item for that purpose.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:～用 (for use by)
  - term: ～専用
    meaning: exclusive use for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～専用」 denotes something that is exclusively for a specific use or group, implying restriction
      or dedication. This is stronger and more restrictive than 「向き」, which simply implies suitability
      or intention.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:～専用 (exclusive use for)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「向き」 and similar expressions, consider the nuance you
  want to convey. If you want to emphasize physical movement or a specific direction of action, use 「に向かって」.
  If the focus is on a particular aim or intended target, use 「に向けて」. If the focus is on a reason or purpose,
  「ため(に)」 is appropriate. For specifically designed targets, 「向け」 is best. If you need to indicate matching
  or conformity, use 「に合わせて/に合った」. While 「方向」 and 「方」 both mean 'direction,' they are more general; 「方向」
  refers to a path or general bearing, and 「方」 can mean a general area or method, whereas 「向き」 refers
  to the precise way something is facing. Lastly, 「～用」 indicates something is 'for use by' a group, and
  「～専用」 implies 'exclusive use', both being more specific designations than the general 'suitability'
  of 「向き」.

        english: This camera is designed for travel, so it's small and light.
        hint: The grammar 「向け」 implies something was specifically designed for a purpose. We're looking
          for a camera that is naturally suitable for travel, not necessarily designed just for it.
    scene: A salesperson is explaining the features of a camera to a customer, highlighting its benefits
      for certain activities.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「旅行向き」 (ryokō muki) implies that the camera's characteristics (small and light)
      inherently make it a good fit for travel, not that it was exclusively designed for travel, but rather
      naturally suited for it. The politeness of 「です」 is appropriate for a sales context. A male speaker
      might use slightly more direct or assertive language in a sales context, which this sentence structure
      allows for while remaining polite.
    etymology: 旅行 (ryokō) means travel, 軽い (karui) means light (in weight).

      appropriate for a friendly conversation between female friends. A female speaker often values aspects
      like brightness and comfort in describing her home.

      like the economy or a person's mood. The phrase 「～のようです」 adds a degree of politeness and tentativeness,

      but common in business contexts for both genders.
