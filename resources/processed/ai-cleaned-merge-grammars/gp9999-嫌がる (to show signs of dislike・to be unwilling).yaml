formation:
  な-Adjective[stem] + がる: Attaches to the stem of certain な-adjectives (e.g., 嫌い) to form a verb indicating
    that someone exhibits signs of that feeling.
  Noun を 嫌がる: To show dislike for a noun, or to be unwilling to do something involving a noun.

jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used when observing and interpreting another person's or entity's actions as indicative
    of dislike or unwillingness.
  function: Describes an observable outward behavior or attitude of a third person. It's used when you
    infer someone's feelings based on their actions, rather than stating their direct internal emotion.
  nuance: Crucially implies an external manifestation. It highlights that the speaker is observing and
    interpreting the subject's actions as indicating dislike or unwillingness. It cannot be used for one's
    own feelings of dislike (use 嫌い instead). It implies a slight resistance or aversion.
  counterpoint: 嫌い (な-adjective) expresses an internal dislike for oneself or others directly.
etymology: The がる suffix is added to the stems of adjectives to form verbs that describe the outward manifestation
  of an emotion or state typically associated with that adjective. For 嫌がる, it comes from the な-adjective
  嫌い (kirai), meaning "disliked" or "hateful." By attaching がる to the stem 嫌い (which often reduces to
  嫌が), it creates the verb 嫌がる, literally meaning "to show signs of disliking" or "to act as if one dislikes."
  This structure applies to other emotional adjectives like 悲しい (sad) becoming 悲しがる (to act sad) or 欲しがる
  (to want).
writeup: |-
  嫌がる is a verb that describes a third person's **observable behavior** that indicates dislike, unwillingness, or aversion towards something or doing something. It is formed by attaching the suffix がる to the stem of the な-adjective 嫌い (kirai), meaning "disliked" or "hateful."

  The key nuance of 嫌がる lies in its focus on **external manifestation**. You use 嫌がる when you observe someone's actions and infer that they dislike something or are unwilling to do it. It implies that the subject is **showing signs** of aversion, perhaps through facial expressions, body language, or verbal protests, rather than directly stating their internal feeling.

  For example, if a child pushes away a plate of vegetables, you might say 子供が野菜を**嫌がっています** (Kodomo ga yasai o iyagatte imasu - The child is showing signs of disliking the vegetables). You are describing their actions, not necessarily their innermost thoughts.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   **Third-person perspective only**: 嫌がる cannot be used to describe your *own* feelings of dislike. For your own feelings, you would use 嫌い or 嫌だ.
      *   Incorrect: 私は納豆を嫌がります。(I show signs of disliking natto.)
      *   Correct: 私は納豆が嫌いです。(I dislike natto.)
  *   嫌がる implies a **slight resistance or aversion**, often a subtle one. If the dislike is very strong or explicit, 嫌い might be more direct.
  *   While 嫌い describes a static state of dislike, 嫌がる describes an **action or ongoing behavior** of showing dislike or unwillingness.

    meaning: I don't want to・no!
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 嫌だ is a more direct, sometimes emphatic, expression of not wanting something, often used in

      behavior of unwillingness.

  - term: いやいや
    meaning: unwillingly・reluctantly
    kind: similar expression

    grammar_point: <suggest>:いやいや (unwillingly)

    grammar_point: Verb[たい] (desiderative)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 嫌がる focuses on observable outward signs of aversion, 嫌い and 嫌だ directly
  state an internal feeling of dislike. 嫌い is generally used for one's own feelings or for stating a general
  characteristic, whereas 嫌だ is a more immediate, often vocal, expression of refusal or dislike. いやいや
  describes the *manner* of an action, indicating that it was done reluctantly, rather than the act of
  showing dislike itself. Finally, 〜たくない is about one's *own* lack of desire to do something, contrasting
  with 嫌がる which is about *someone else's* exhibited unwillingness. Remember, 嫌がる implies you are *seeing*
  the dislike, not just knowing it.
