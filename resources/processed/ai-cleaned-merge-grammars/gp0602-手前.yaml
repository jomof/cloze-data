    },
    "etymology": "The word 「手前」 originally meant \"the space in front of one's hands\" or \"oneself.\" Over time, it evolved to include meanings related to one's position, perspective, or the area immediately surrounding oneself. The nuance of obligation or constraint arises from the idea that one's actions must be considered in relation to their immediate surroundings or personal standing.",
    "writeup": "The noun 「手前」, meaning \"in front of,\" has several meanings depending on context. When used with a verb in its plain form, it indicates that one is compelled to act in a certain way due to a prior action or circumstance. This can be interpreted as \"now that (A), (B),\" implying that nothing can be done except to move forward given the current situation. It highlights a sense of obligation or an unavoidable consequence stemming from a previous event.\n\nWhen 「手前」 appears with a noun followed by the particle 「の」, it often expresses that what is \"in front of\" (A) is the reason for (B), or simply describes something being \"in front of\" (B). This can refer to a physical location, but also to a metaphorical position, such as being \"in front of\" an audience or a superior, thereby influencing one's actions. Despite the various translations, 「手前」 consistently conveys something that is \"facing\" the noun or verb it modifies. Thinking of this structure as similar to \"faced with (A), (B)\" may be helpful, as English also expresses a lack of options and finality in this way.",
