It is important to remember that 「こと」 refers to intangible concepts, unlike 「もの」, which refers to tangible objects.When used with verbs and *i*-adjectives, 「こと」 directly follows the plain form. For example, 「食べる」 (taberu) becomes 「食べること」 (taberu koto), meaning \"eating (the act of)\". Likewise, 「面白い」 (omoshiroi) becomes 「面白いこと」 (omoshiroi koto), meaning \"(the thing that is) interesting\".When used with *na*-adjectives, 「な」 is inserted between the adjective stem and 「こと」. For example, 「大事」 (daiji) becomes 「大事なこと」 (daiji na koto), meaning \"(the thing that is) important\".When used with nouns, 「の」 is inserted between the noun and 「こと」. For example, 「先生」 (sensei) becomes 「先生のこと」 (sensei no koto), meaning \"(the thing about) the teacher\".",
