    },
    "etymology": "The word 「こと」 originally comes from the verb 「言 (こと)」, meaning \"to say\" or \"to speak\". Over time, it evolved to refer to the content of what is said, and eventually to abstract things, matters, or events in general.",
    "writeup": "The noun 「こと」 is used to refer to abstract things, matters, or events. It is often used to nominalize verbs and adjectives, turning them into nouns. It is important to remember that 「こと」 refers to intangible concepts, unlike 「もの」, which refers to tangible objects.\n\nWhen used with verbs and *i*-adjectives, 「こと」 directly follows the plain form. For example, 「食べる」 (taberu) becomes 「食べること」 (taberu koto), meaning \"eating (the act of)\". Likewise, 「面白い」 (omoshiroi) becomes 「面白いこと」 (omoshiroi koto), meaning \"(the thing that is) interesting\".\n\nWhen used with *na*-adjectives, 「な」 is inserted between the adjective stem and 「こと」. For example, 「大事」 (daiji) becomes 「大事なこと」 (daiji na koto), meaning \"(the thing that is) important\".\n\nWhen used with nouns, 「の」 is inserted between the noun and 「こと」. For example, 「先生」 (sensei) becomes 「先生のこと」 (sensei no koto), meaning \"(the thing about) the teacher\".",

            "etymology": "The use of 「覚える こと」 emphasizes the conceptual nature of 'learning' as an activity, rather than just the outcome or the specific words. The historical development of 「こと」 from 'speech' to 'abstract matters' reinforces this usage for processes and activities."

            "etymology": "The phrase 「好き な こと」 refers to an abstract 'thing' or 'matter' that is liked. This aligns with the evolution of 「こと」 to signify general abstract concepts, not just tangible objects.

            "etymology": "The use of 「～のこと」 to mean 'matters concerning something' is a natural extension of 「こと」's meaning as 'abstract thing' or 'affair'. It emphasizes that the focus is on the general aspects, welfare, or condition related to the family, rather than the family members as physical objects."

            "etymology": "The construction 「大事 な こと」 uses the na-adjective 「大事」 (important) to describe the abstract 'thing' or 'matter'.

            "etymology": "The addition of 「ばかり」 to 「家族 の こと」 further emphasizes the exclusive focus on abstract matters related to the family.
