    "etymology": "The kanji 「最」 means \"utmost\" or \"most,\" and 「中」 means \"middle\" or \"center.\" Together, 「最中」 literally translates to \"utmost middle,\" emphasizing the peak or height of an activity when something else occurs.",
    "writeup": "「最中に」 (saichuu ni) emphasizes that something happens **right in the middle** of another action or event. 「最中」 literally means \"utmost middle,\" highlighting that the interruption or event occurs at the peak or most intense part of the ongoing action. It's similar to saying \"at the height of\" or \"in the midst of\" something. Typically, the sentence will highlight an interruption of the ongoing action. It attaches to the te-form of a verb or a noun followed by 「の」. While 「最中に」 can occasionally be used with adjectives, it's uncommon and generally refers to the pinnacle of a feeling or emotion.",

            "nuance": "While 「最中に」 emphasizes interruption at the peak of an activity, 「〜ところに」 simply indicates timing or location when something occurs. For example, 「出かけるところに雨が降ってきた」 (It started raining just as I was about to leave) focuses on the timing of the rain, not necessarily an interruption."

            "nuance": "「途中に」 and 「途中で」 indicate being physically or figuratively in the middle of something, but do not necessarily imply an interruption or that the action is at its peak, unlike 「最中に」.

            "nuance": "「とき」 is a general marker of time and does not carry the nuance of interruption or being at the height of an activity like 「最中に」. For example, 「子供の時、よく川で泳いだ」 (When I was a child, I often swam in the river) describes a past habit without any sense of interruption."
