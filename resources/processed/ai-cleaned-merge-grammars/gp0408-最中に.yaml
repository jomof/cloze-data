    "etymology": "「最中」 (saichuu) literally means \"utmost middle.\" It indicates being at the peak or height of something. The addition of 「に」 (ni) turns it into an adverbial phrase, specifying that an event occurs during this peak.",
    "writeup": "「最中に」 (saichuu ni) emphasizes that something happens **right in the middle** of an action or event. 「最中」 means \"utmost middle,\" similar to phrases like \"at the height of\" or \"in the midst of.\" It's often used when an interruption or disturbance occurs. Attach 「最中に」 to the te-form of a verb or a noun followed by 「の」. While it can occasionally be used with adjectives, this is uncommon; in those cases, it denotes being at the pinnacle of the described feeling or emotion.",
