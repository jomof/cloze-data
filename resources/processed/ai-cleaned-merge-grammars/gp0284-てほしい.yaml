    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てほしい」 combines the te-form of a verb, which indicates a state or action in progress, with the adjective 「ほしい」, which means \"wanted\" or \"desired\". Together, they express the speaker's desire for someone else to perform the action indicated by the verb.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てほしい」 expresses that the speaker wants someone else to do something. It's formed by attaching 「ほしい」 to the te-form of a verb. For example, 「手伝ってほしい」 means \"I want you to help me\". The level of politeness can be adjusted using 「です」, as in 「手伝ってほしいです」. While most often it means \"I want you to\", 「てほしい」 can also be used to ask about or explain what other people want someone to do, so context is **important**.",
