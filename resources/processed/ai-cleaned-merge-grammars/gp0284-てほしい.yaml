        "nuance": "This construction focuses on the speaker's desire for an external action. It can range from a soft request to a strong demand depending on context, intonation, and accompanying particles."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammatical construction 「てほしい」 is formed by combining the te-form of a verb with the auxiliary adjective 「ほしい」. The te-form acts as a conjunctive particle, linking the verb to 「ほしい」. Historically, 「ほしい」 comes from the classical Japanese word 「ほし」, meaning 'to want' or 'to desire', which could be used for both objects and actions. Over time, its use evolved, particularly in modern Japanese, to pair with the te-form of verbs specifically for expressing a desire for *another person's* action. This evolution highlights a linguistic mechanism of using adjectives to modify actions rather than just nouns, forming a core part of Japanese desiderative expressions.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てほしい」 (te hoshii) is used to express the speaker's desire for **someone else** to perform an action. It is formed by taking a verb, changing it to its **te-form**, and then appending 「ほしい」.\n\nWhile 「ほしい」 on its own means 'to want (an object)', when combined with the te-form of a verb, it transforms into an auxiliary adjective indicating a desire for an action.\n\nFor example, if you want someone to help you, you would say 「手伝ってほしい」 (tetsudatte hoshii - literally, 'help-te want').\n\nThe level of politeness can be adjusted by adding 「です」 (desu) after 「ほしい」, making it 「てほしいです」 for polite contexts. However, the basic 「てほしい」 can be used in casual settings.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Who wants whom to do what?** It's crucial to understand the subject of the desire (the speaker) and the object of the action (the person performing the action). While it often translates as \"I want *you* to do X,\" it can also be used to report what a third person wants someone else to do, such as 「彼が私にこれを読んでほしいと言っていた」 (Kare ga watashi ni kore o yonde hoshii to itteita - He said he wants me to read this). The context, including particles (e.g., に for the recipient of the request) and surrounding phrases, helps clarify this.\n*   **Nuance:** Depending on the context and intonation, 「てほしい」 can convey a range of meanings from a gentle request or wish to a stronger demand.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「てほしい」 expresses the speaker's desire for another's action, other related expressions convey different nuances of wanting. 「たい」 is exclusively for the speaker's own desire to perform an action. 「がほしい」 is used for wanting objects. When observing another person's desire, 「たがる」 or 「がる」 are used to describe what they *appear* to want or feel. Lastly, 「ように〜てほしい」 is for when the desire is for a certain outcome or state to be achieved through an action, rather than simply for the action itself.",
