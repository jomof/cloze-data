    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the honorific prefix お or ご with the verb ください (kudasai), which is the imperative form of くださる (kudasaru), the honorific equivalent of くれる (kureru, to give). Therefore, it literally means 'please give (me) the favor of doing [verb]', but is understood as a polite request for someone to perform an action. This construction reflects the Japanese emphasis on the receiver of an action and the speaker's deference.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point お〜ください is an honorific expression used to politely request someone to do something. It is similar to なさい but significantly more polite, making it suitable for making requests to almost anyone, regardless of their status relative to you. This makes it a versatile form used in various formal and semi-formal contexts, such as business interactions, customer service, and public announcements. The お prefix is generally used with native Japanese verbs, often by adding it to the verb stem (e.g., 待つ → お待ち). The ご prefix is typically used with Sino-Japanese words, particularly with nouns that can function as verbs (e.g., 連絡する → ご連絡). It is important to note that ご〜ください can also appear as part of the humble speech expression ご〜する (or お〜する), where it becomes ご〜してください, which implies performing an action for someone else in a humble manner.",

            "nuance": "なさい is a command and can sound quite direct or even reprimanding, primarily used by a superior to an inferior (e.g., parent to child). お〜ください is a much softer, more polite request, suitable for a wider range of social interactions."

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key distinction between お〜ください and other similar expressions lies in the level of politeness and formality. While てください is a standard polite request suitable for everyday interactions, お〜ください elevates the level of respect and is appropriate for formal settings, customer service, or when addressing superiors. なさい is a more direct command, used in situations where a superior gives instructions to an inferior, and should be used with caution as it can sound abrupt. お〜願う, on the other hand, is generally reserved for written communication or highly formal spoken contexts, often implying a more significant request or favor.",
