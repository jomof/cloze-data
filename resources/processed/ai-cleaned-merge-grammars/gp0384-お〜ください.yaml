        "usage-context": "honorific language"

    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the honorific prefix お or ご with the verb ください (kudasai), which is the imperative form of くださる (kudasaru), the honorific equivalent of くれる (kureru, to give). Therefore, it literally means 'please give (me) the favor of doing [verb]', but is understood as a polite request for someone to perform an action. This construction reflects the Japanese emphasis on the receiver of an action and the speaker's deference.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point お〜ください is an honorific expression used to politely request someone to do something. It is similar to なさい but significantly more polite, making it suitable for making requests to almost anyone, regardless of their status relative to you. This makes it a versatile form used in various formal and semi-formal contexts, such as business interactions, customer service, and public announcements. The お prefix is generally used with native Japanese verbs, often by adding it to the verb stem (e.g., 待つ → お待ち). The ご prefix is typically used with Sino-Japanese words, particularly with nouns that can function as verbs (e.g., 連絡する → ご連絡). It is important to note that ご〜ください can also appear as part of the humble speech expression ご〜する (or お〜する), where it becomes ご〜してください, which implies performing an action for someone else in a humble manner.",
