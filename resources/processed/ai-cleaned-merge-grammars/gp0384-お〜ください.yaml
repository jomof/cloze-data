    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the honorific prefix お or ご with the verb ください (kudasai), which is the imperative form of くださる (kudasaru), the honorific equivalent of くれる (kureru, to give). Therefore, it literally means \"please give (me) the favor of doing [verb]\", but is understood as a polite request for someone to perform an action.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「お〜ください」 is an honorific expression used to politely request someone to do something. It's similar to 「なさい」 but more polite, suitable for making requests to almost anyone, regardless of their status relative to you. The 「お」 prefix is generally used with native Japanese words, while 「ご」 is used with Sino-Japanese words (words of Chinese origin). Be aware that 「ご〜ください」 is also part of the humble speech expression 「ご〜する」 (or 「お〜する」) where it becomes 「ご〜してください」.",
