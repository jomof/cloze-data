    "writeup": "ぜ is an emphatic sentence-ending particle in Japanese, used similarly to よ. It emphasizes the speaker's statement but is generally considered less forceful than particles like ぞ. It can be appended to any sentence ending in the plain form, including those ending with auxiliary verbs. For nouns, ぜ follows the auxiliary verb だ. ぜ is typically used when addressing someone with whom you are familiar or close. While often conveying friendliness, it can also be used when speaking to a rival or someone with whom you share a similar relationship. Unlike ぞ, ぜ is almost exclusively used by men in casual conversation. Think of it as adding a \"You know?\" or \"Right?\" to the end of a sentence when speaking with friends.",
    "etymology": "The particle ぜ originates from a combination of ぞ followed by え. え is an alternative form of the sentence-ending particle い, which is seen in forms like だい and かい. As い is primarily used in a 'friendly' or 'familiar' way, ぜ retains a similar nuance. In essence, ぞえ evolved into ぜ, eventually becoming its own distinct particle over time.",
