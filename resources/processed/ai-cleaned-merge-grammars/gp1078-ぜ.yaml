        "usage-context": "Used in casual conversation among friends or people the speaker is familiar with, often conveying friendliness or a close, familiar relationship. It can also be used when addressing rivals, indicating a certain level of familiarity or challenge.",
        "function": "To add strong emphasis to a statement, invitation, or declaration.",
        "nuance": "Carries a slightly weaker force than ぞ, maintaining a nuance of friendliness and familiarity. It is almost exclusively used by men, giving statements a masculine tone. It conveys a strong personal assertion or a forceful, familiar invitation.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a sentence-final particle."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「ぜ」 is believed to have originated from the combination of 「ぞ」 (another emphatic particle) and 「え」, an older variant of 「い」, a sentence-ending particle denoting familiarity or friendliness. Over time, 「ぞえ」 contracted to 「ぜ」, retaining the nuance of friendliness and familiarity.",
    "writeup": "「ぜ」 is an emphatic sentence-ending particle used to add strong emphasis to a statement. It is similar to 「よ」 but generally carries a slightly weaker force than 「ぞ」. This particle is predominantly used by men. It can be appended to the plain form of verbs and い-adjectives. For な-adjectives and nouns, 「ぜ」 follows the auxiliary verb 「だ」 in its plain form (e.g., 静かだぜ, 学生だぜ). 「ぜ」 is typically used in casual speech among friends or individuals with whom the speaker shares a close, familiar relationship. While often conveying a hint of friendliness, it can also appear in situations where the speaker is making a statement to a rival or someone with whom they have a competitive relationship, distinguishing it from 「ぞ」, which can be directed at anybody.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「ぜ」, 「ぞ」 carries a stronger, more assertive tone and can be used to issue warnings or make declarations. It doesn't necessarily imply friendliness or familiarity, and can be used in more formal or confrontational contexts.",

            "meaning": "Emphasis (feminine)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「わ」 is generally used by women to soften the tone of a statement or express personal sentiment, often adding a gentle emphasis. This is in contrast to 「ぜ」, which is used by men to add emphasis and familiarity, sometimes with a more forceful tone.",

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ぜ」, 「ぞ」, 「よ」, and 「わ」 all function as sentence-ending particles that add emphasis, they differ significantly in tone, gender association, and specific nuance. 「ぜ」 provides a friendly, masculine emphasis; 「ぞ」 offers a stronger, more assertive or warning emphasis; 「よ」 gives a general, less gender-specific emphasis or informative tone; and 「わ」 conveys a softer, often feminine emphasis. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for choosing the most appropriate particle for your communication.",
