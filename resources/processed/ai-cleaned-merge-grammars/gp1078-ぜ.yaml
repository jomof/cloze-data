        "usage-context": "Used in casual conversation among friends or people the speaker is familiar with, often conveying friendliness or a close, familiar relationship. It can also be used when addressing rivals, indicating a certain level of familiarity or challenge.",
        "function": "To add strong emphasis to a statement, invitation, or declaration.",

    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「ぜ」 is believed to have originated from the combination of 「ぞ」 (another emphatic particle) and 「え」, an older variant of 「い」, a sentence-ending particle denoting familiarity or friendliness. Over time, 「ぞえ」 contracted to 「ぜ」, retaining the nuance of friendliness and familiarity.",
    "writeup": "「ぜ」 is an emphatic sentence-ending particle used to add strong emphasis to a statement. It is similar to 「よ」 but generally carries a slightly weaker force than 「ぞ」. This particle is predominantly used by men.\n\nIt can be appended to the plain form of verbs and い-adjectives. For な-adjectives and nouns, 「ぜ」 follows the auxiliary verb 「だ」 in its plain form (e.g., 静かだぜ, 学生だぜ).\n\n「ぜ」 is typically used in casual speech among friends or individuals with whom the speaker shares a close, familiar relationship. While often conveying a hint of friendliness, it can also appear in situations where the speaker is making a statement to a rival or someone with whom they have a competitive relationship, distinguishing it from 「ぞ」, which can be directed at anybody.",
