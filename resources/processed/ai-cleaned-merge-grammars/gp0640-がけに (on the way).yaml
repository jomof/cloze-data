id: gp0640
meaning: On the way to, As you go, While doing
meaning_warning: Kanji is rarely used
pronunciation:
  katakana: ガケニ
  romaji: gakeni
formation:
  Verb[ます-stem] + がけに: Indicates doing something 'on the way' or 'while' performing the verb.
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to express an action performed incidentally or conveniently during the course of
    another action or journey.
  function: Adverbial phrase modifying the main action.
  nuance: Implies that the incidental action is a natural or convenient consequence of the primary action
    or movement, often suggesting efficiency or a thoughtful detour.
etymology: 「がけに」 comes from the verb 「掛ける (かける)」, meaning "to hang, to suspend, to start, to begin." In
  this grammar point, it carries the nuance of something being done *in the process* of doing something
  else, like hanging an action *onto* another. It conveys the sense of extending or placing something
  across a duration or process, thus implying that action (B) is carried out *along the span* of action
  (A).
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「がけに」 attaches to the ます-stem of a verb, indicating that an action (B) occurs 'on the way to' or 'while' performing another action (A). While it may not be as frequently encountered in modern Japanese as some other expressions, its nuance is quite specific. It suggests that action (B) is performed either incidentally during action (A), or specifically because action (A) presents a convenient opportunity for action (B).

  This structure can appear with or without its corresponding kanji, 掛けに. Both forms are valid, though the hiragana version is more common in modern usage. Familiarity with both forms is beneficial for recognition.

  - term: 途中に・途中で
    meaning: On the way, Partway, In the middle of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「がけに」, 「途中に」 or 「途中で」 simply state that an action occurs at some point during a journey
      or process, without necessarily implying convenience or integration into the primary action.
    grammar_point: 途中に・途中で (in the middle of)
  - term: ついでに
    meaning: While you are at it, On the occasion
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ついでに」 emphasizes taking advantage of an opportunity to do something extra because you are
      already engaged in another activity. While similar, 「がけに」 focuses more on the action being performed
      naturally 'along the way' of a movement, whereas 「ついでに」 is about leveraging an existing occasion.
    grammar_point: ついでに (taking the opportunity)
post_false_friends_writeup: Both 「途中に」/「途中で」 and 「ついでに」 can be used to express doing something "on the
  way," but they have slightly different nuances. When using 「がけに」, focus on the idea of the action happening
  *during* the journey or process as a natural or convenient inclusion. 「ついでに」 is more about doing something
  *because* you're already doing something else and want to take advantage of that opportunity, regardless
  of whether it's part of a physical journey.

          a natural or convenient stop integrated into the journey.
    scene: A person reflecting on their daily routine.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The phrase 「帰り がけ に」 emphasizes that buying the drink was a quick, integrated stop, part of
      the natural flow of going home from work, rather than a separate, deliberate errand.
    etymology: The formation combines the noun '帰り' (kaeri, return) with 'がけに' to indicate 'on the way
      back'.

    japanese:

        english: Manager, could you please hand this document to Tanaka when you go home?
        hint: 「帰り に」 is a more general expression for 'on your way home' or 'when you go home', without

          an action conveniently performed *during* the journey.

    register: semi-formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)

      the action is a convenient and efficient integration into the manager's existing journey home, rather
      than an additional task.
    etymology: Similar to example 0, 「帰り がけ に」 combines '帰り' (kaeri) with 'がけに'.

    scene: A grandparent reminiscing with their grandchild.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「よく 遊ん だ もの だ」 indicates a nostalgic recollection of something that used to happen

        hint: 「帰る 時 に」 indicates an action at the point of going home, but 「がけに」 conveys the nuance of

          way' nuance.
    scene: A friend offering advice to another friend whose girlfriend is ill.
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

      of happiness.

          latter.
    scene: A person making a thoughtful offer to someone they are interested in, for a casual meeting.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: female

    scene: Two friends gossiping about someone they just saw.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「さっき の 彼」 (that guy earlier) and the sentence-final particle 「〜た よね」, which seeks
      confirmation while sharing information, are common in casual, conversational exchanges, particularly
      among female friends sharing observations or gossip. 「来 がけ に」 specifies the singing occurred precisely
      *during* the process of his arrival, rather than just at some random point on his journey.
    etymology: 「来 がけ に」 combines the verb stem of 「来る」 (kuru, to come) with 「がけに」, meaning 'on the way
      here'.
  - english: Hey, how about a quick drink on the way home? I have so much I want to talk about.
    japanese:

        english: Hey, how about a quick drink on the way home? I have so much I want to talk about.
        hint: 「帰る 途中で」 is a general phrase for 'on the way home'. 「がけに」 subtly implies the drink is a
          natural, convenient part of the journey, making the invitation feel more spontaneous and less
          like a separate event. We're looking for that integrated feeling.
    scene: A man subtly inviting a colleague for a casual drink after work.

      quick drink?) is a common, informal invitation. The addition of 「話したい こと が たくさん ある ん だ」 (I have
      a lot I want to talk about) suggests a desire for deeper conversation, often used in a subtly persuasive
      or flirty manner. 「帰り がけ に」 frames the drink as a natural, seamless extension of the day, making
      the invitation feel less formal and more spontaneous.
    etymology: Similar to example 0, 「帰り がけ に」 combines '帰り' (kaeri) with 'がけに'.

        english: On the way to the party, I bought wine.
        hint: 「途中 で」 is a general term for 'during the journey', whereas 「がけに」 implies the action was

          nuance.
    scene: A friend recounting how they prepared for a party, emphasizing their efficiency.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: The phrase 「行き がけ に」 emphasizes that picking up the wine was a convenient and natural part
      of the journey *to* the party, implying thoughtfulness and efficiency rather than a separate errand.
    etymology: The term 「行き」 (iki) refers to the act of going or departing, and combined with 「がけに」, it
      indicates an action performed during the process of going somewhere.
  - english: On his way out, he left a message for me.

          it was done *in the process* of leaving, implying it was incidental or just before leaving.
          We're looking for that 'as he was going out' nuance.
    scene: A colleague informing another about someone's departure and what they did.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The phrase 「出 がけ に」 emphasizes that leaving the message was an incidental action performed
      precisely *as* he was in the process of departing, suggesting it was done just before or during
      the act of leaving, making it sound very timely.
    etymology: 「出」 (de) is the verb stem of 「出る」 (deru), meaning 'to leave' or 'to go out'. Combining
      it with 「がけに」 indicates an.action performed in the midst of one's departure.
post_example_writeup: The usage of がけに emphasizes the action being performed as an integral part of the
  primary movement or journey, rather than just something that happens to occur at a point in time or
  location.
