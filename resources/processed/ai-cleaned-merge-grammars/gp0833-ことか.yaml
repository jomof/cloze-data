    "etymology": "「ことか」 is derived from 「こと」 (koto), meaning 'thing' or 'matter', combined with the interrogative particle 「か」 (ka). This structure rhetorically questions the degree or extent of something, transforming an observation into an exclamation of strong emotion or magnitude.",
    "writeup": "「ことか」 is a grammar pattern used to express a strong emotional reaction such as surprise, admiration, or exasperation. It functions as a rhetorical question, implying that the extent of something is so significant it is almost unbelievable. This pattern often follows adverbs that indicate degree or quantity, such as 「どれだけ」 (dore dake, 'how much'), 「どんなに」 (donna ni, 'how'), or 「なんと」 (nanto, 'what'). It can also follow words like 「何回」 (nan kai, 'how many times') to emphasize frequency.\n\nWhile grammatically a question, 「ことか」 does not seek an answer but rather emphasizes the magnitude of the statement. For example, 「どれだけ嬉しいことか！」 (How happy I am!) conveys an overwhelming sense of joy. Its usage typically adds a poetic or dramatic flair to the expression. Therefore, it is predominantly found in written Japanese, formal speech, or situations where the speaker intentionally aims for a dramatic effect. In casual daily conversation, it might sound unnatural or overly theatrical.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「ことか」, 「一体」 is used to emphasize a question, conveying confusion, exasperation, or demanding clarification, rather than expressing a heightened emotional state about an observation."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ものか」 and 「一体」 can share an exclamatory quality with 「ことか」, they serve distinct functions. Use 「ものか」 when expressing a strong, unequivocal denial. Use 「一体」 to add emphasis or a sense of bewilderment to an interrogative statement. These are distinct from 「ことか」's role in conveying strong emotional magnitude.",
