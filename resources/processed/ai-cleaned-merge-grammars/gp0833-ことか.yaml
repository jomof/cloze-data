    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことか」 combines 「こと」 (koto), meaning 'thing' or 'matter,' and 「か」 (ka), a question particle. Together, they create a rhetorical question that expresses a strong emotional feeling about something. The 「か」 isn't seeking an answer but rather emphasizing the magnitude or intensity of the feeling.",
    "writeup": "The 「ことか」 grammar point is used to express a strong emotional feeling, such as surprise, admiration, or regret. It translates to \"How…!\", \"What…!\", or \"God knows…!\" in English. It is often used with words that highlight a particular number or extent, such as 「どれだけ」 (dore dake - how much) or 「何度」 (nando - how many times).\n\n「ことか」 is often found at the end of a statement, emphasizing that the extent of something is unusual or unbelievable.\n\nIn modern Japanese, this expression is more common in written language and can sound dramatic or poetic. Using it in daily speech might sound unnatural unless the speaker is intentionally being dramatic.",

            "etymology": "The use of 「どれだけ」 emphasizes the extent of happiness felt."
