        "usage-context": "Used in formal or semi-formal situations, or when showing extra respect or humility towards the listener. It is a highly polite request form.",
        "function": "To make a humble and polite request.",
        "nuance": "This expression carries a strong sense of humility and deference, implying that the speaker is receiving a favor from the listener. It is more polite and formal than 「てください」 or 「てもらえませんか」."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ていただけませんか」 is composed of 「て」 (the conjunctive particle), 「いただく」 (the humble form of 「もらう」, meaning \"to receive\"), 「ません」 (the polite negative auxiliary verb), and 「か」 (the question particle). The verb 「いただく」 literally means \"to receive\" or \"to accept,\" but in this context, it expresses the speaker's humility when requesting someone to do something. Historically, 「いただく」 derived from 「頂く」, which means \"to place on one's head\" (e.g., receiving something precious from a superior), thus metaphorically conveying the humble act of receiving a favor. The negative potential form 「いただけません」 combined with the interrogative 「か」 softens the request, making it sound less like a demand and more like a humble inquiry.",
    "writeup": "「ていただけませんか」 is a highly polite and humble way to ask someone to do something for you. It is often used in formal or business settings, or when you wish to show significant respect to the person you are addressing. This phrase is the humble equivalent of 「てもらえませんか」. The use of 「いただく」, the humble form of 「もらう」 (to receive), signifies that the speaker is receiving a favor from the listener, thereby elevating the listener's status and humbling the speaker's own position. This structure combines the て-form of a verb, followed by 「いただく」 in its polite negative form 「いただけません」, and finally the question particle 「か」.\n\nWhile the literal translation might seem negative (\"Won't you...?\"), its function is to soften the request, making it sound less direct and more deferential. It implies a sense of 'would you be so kind as to do this for me?'\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Politeness Level:** This is a very polite expression. Using it with close friends or family might sound overly formal or even sarcastic, depending on the context.\n*   **Context:** It is suitable for asking favors from superiors, clients, strangers, or in any situation where a high degree of politeness and respect is required.\n*   **Kanji:** 「いただく」 can be written with the kanji 「頂く」, which literally means 'to be topped with' or 'to receive on one's head'. This kanji reinforces the respectful nature of the request, implying that the favor is received from 'above'.",

            "nuance": "The opening phrase 「恐れ入りますが」 (Excuse me, but...) immediately sets a humble and polite tone. The request itself, using 「ご確認 て いただけませんか」, reinforces this politeness, making it suitable for a female speaker in a professional setting where indirect and deferential language is common. The 「ご～ください」 form (e.g., ご確認ください) would be more direct.",
            "etymology": "The phrase 「恐れ入りますが」 is a polite apology for inconveniencing someone, literally meaning \"I am filled with awe/reverence, but...\" or \"I am sorry to trouble you, but...\". It shows deep consideration before making a request or statement that might impose on the listener. 「ご 確認」 combines the honorific prefix 「ご」 with the noun 「確認」 (confirmation/check), indicating respect for the action being performed by the listener. It's a common element in formal and business Japanese to elevate the listener's action."

            "etymology": "「もし よろしければ」 literally translates to \"if it's good (for you)\" or \"if it's alright (with you).\" 「よろしい」 is a more formal and polite form of 「よい」/「いい」 (good). This phrase is used as a polite prelude to a request, giving the listener an easy way to decline without losing face, which is a key aspect of Japanese communication. 「重い 荷物」 refers to \"heavy luggage,\" where 「重い」 is an adjective meaning \"heavy\" and 「荷物」 means \"luggage\" or \"baggage.\" The use of these words is straightforward, but the overall polite framing of the request highlights the cultural importance of not imposing on others without their express willingness."

This fits the 'scene' of a student asking for clarification about something they couldn't grasp earlier. The introductory phrase 「お忙しい ところ 恐縮ですが」 (I apologize for disturbing you while you're busy) further emphasizes the speaker's politeness and consideration.",
            "etymology": "「お忙しい ところ 恐縮ですが」 is a highly polite set phrase used to apologize for bothering someone when they are busy. 「お忙しい」 is the honorific form of 「忙しい」 (busy), showing respect for the listener's time. 「ところ」 functions here as a contextual marker, meaning \"at the time when...\" or \"while...\". 「恐縮」 means \"feeling obliged\" or \"feeling grateful/apologetic.\" The combination expresses deep humility and an apology for interrupting or imposing. 「問題」 (mondai) means \"problem\" or \"question,\" and 「説明」 (setsumei) means \"explanation.\" The structure of the sentence with these elements highlights the speaker's deference to the listener's authority and knowledge, typical in a student-professor dynamic."

It reflects the respect for hierarchy common in Japanese business interactions.",
            "etymology": "「議題 に つい て」 means \"regarding the agenda,\" where 「議題」 (gidai) is \"agenda\" and 「に つい て」 is a particle phrase meaning \"about\" or \"regarding.\" 「ご 意見」 combines the honorific prefix 「ご」 with 「意見」 (iken), meaning \"opinion,\" showing respect for the listener's thoughts. 「お 聞かせ」 is the honorific causative form of 「聞く」 (kiku), which means \"to hear\" or \"to ask,\" and here it is used transitively meaning \"to let me hear.\" This honorific causative structure is used to politely request someone to cause the speaker to hear something, i.e., to tell them.
