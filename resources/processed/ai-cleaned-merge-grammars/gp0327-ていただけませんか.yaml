        "usage-context": "Used in formal or semi-formal situations, or when showing extra respect or humility towards the listener. It is a highly polite request form.",
        "function": "To make a humble and polite request.",
        "nuance": "This expression carries a strong sense of humility and deference, implying that the speaker is receiving a favor from the listener. It is more polite and formal than 「てください」 or 「てもらえませんか」."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ていただけませんか」 is composed of 「て」 (the conjunctive particle), 「いただく」 (the humble form of 「もらう」, meaning \"to receive\"), 「ません」 (the polite negative auxiliary verb), and 「か」 (the question particle). The verb 「いただく」 literally means \"to receive\" or \"to accept,\" but in this context, it expresses the speaker's humility when requesting someone to do something. Historically, 「いただく」 derived from 「頂く」, which means \"to place on one's head\" (e.g., receiving something precious from a superior), thus metaphorically conveying the humble act of receiving a favor. The negative potential form 「いただけません」 combined with the interrogative 「か」 softens the request, making it sound less like a demand and more like a humble inquiry.",
    "writeup": "「ていただけませんか」 is a highly polite and humble way to ask someone to do something for you. It is often used in formal or business settings, or when you wish to show significant respect to the person you are addressing. This phrase is the humble equivalent of 「てもらえませんか」. The use of 「いただく」, the humble form of 「もらう」 (to receive), signifies that the speaker is receiving a favor from the listener, thereby elevating the listener's status and humbling the speaker's own position. This structure combines the て-form of a verb, followed by 「いただく」 in its polite negative form 「いただけません」, and finally the question particle 「か」.\n\nWhile the literal translation might seem negative (\"Won't you...?\"), its function is to soften the request, making it sound less direct and more deferential. It implies a sense of 'would you be so kind as to do this for me?'\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Politeness Level:** This is a very polite expression. Using it with close friends or family might sound overly formal or even sarcastic, depending on the context.\n*   **Context:** It is suitable for asking favors from superiors, clients, strangers, or in any situation where a high degree of politeness and respect is required.\n*   **Kanji:** 「いただく」 can be written with the kanji 「頂く」, which literally means 'to be topped with' or 'to receive on one's head'. This kanji reinforces the respectful nature of the request, implying that the favor is received from 'above'.",

            "nuance": "The opening phrase 「恐れ入りますが」 (Excuse me, but...) immediately sets a humble and polite tone.
