formation:
  Verb in て-form + てからというもの: Expresses a continuing state or change that has persisted since a certain

    state or change that has occurred since that event.

details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to describe a continuous state or significant change that has occurred as a direct
    result of a preceding event, emphasizing the lasting impact of that event.
  function: Connects a past event to an ongoing state or consequence.
  nuance: Implies a dramatic and lasting shift, often for a prolonged period, emphasizing the continuous
    nature of the subsequent state or effect. It suggests that once the initial event occurred, the resulting
    situation or change became permanent and continuous.
  grammatical-role: Connects a past event to an ongoing state.
  temporal-flow: Highlights a continuous temporal progression from a past event to the present.
etymology: The grammar point 「てからというもの」 combines 「てから」 (after), signifying a temporal sequence, with 「というもの」.
  The latter can be conceptualized as "that which is" or "what is called." This combination emphasizes
  the continuous state or result that has persistently emerged since the initial action or event took
  place. It functions as a set phrase to highlight the enduring consequences of a past occurrence.
writeup: |-
  「てからというもの」 functions as an extension of the basic temporal connector 「てから」. It is used to indicate that a specific state or condition has continued uninterruptedly, or a particular change has persisted, ever since a certain event occurred. This structure implies a direct and lasting cause-and-effect relationship, where action A leads to continuous state B.

  While often translated as "ever since," the nuance is that "from the point of that (A), something came to be, and that state has continued." The phrase itself carries this implication of ongoing effect. It generally follows verbs in their て-form.

  Occasionally, 「それからというもの」 can be observed at the beginning of a new sentence. In such instances, 「それ」 refers to the event or situation previously mentioned, establishing a clear link between that antecedent and the subsequent continuous state.

  **Important Consideration:**

  This phrase implicitly highlights a significant and lasting change. Consequently, it is generally not employed for events that occurred in the very recent past and whose effects have not yet become established as an ongoing condition. The determination of what constitutes a 'long enough' duration is subjective and context-dependent, relying on the perceived lasting impact of the event.
false_friends:
  - term: てから
    meaning: After (simple temporal sequence)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike てからというもの, てから simply indicates a temporal sequence without emphasizing a lasting, continuous
      state or significant change that directly resulted from the preceding action.
    grammar_point: てから (after and since)
  - term: 以来
    meaning: Since, ever since
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While ～以来 also means 'since,' it is more neutral and merely marks a starting point in time.
      It doesn't carry the strong implication of a profound and continuous change or state as a direct
      consequence, which is central to てからというもの.
    grammar_point: 以来 (since・ever since)
  - term: ことから
    meaning: From the fact that; because; due to; given that
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ことから」 indicates the origin or reason for something, often an observation or conclusion, but
      it does not inherently imply a continuous or lasting state has resulted from that fact, unlike 「てからというもの」.
    grammar_point: ことから (from the fact that)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「てからというもの」, 「～てから」, 「～以来」, and 「ことから」 can all relate to causality or
  temporal sequence, their nuances differ. 「～てから」 simply denotes a temporal sequence, meaning "after doing
  X, Y happened." It doesn't imply a lasting effect. 「～以来」 specifies a starting point in time, meaning
  "since X, Y has continued." It is more neutral regarding the nature of Y's continuation. 「ことから」 provides
  the reason or origin, meaning "from the fact X, Y is derived or understood," without necessarily implying
  an ongoing, continuous state from that point. In contrast, 「てからというもの」 strongly emphasizes that the event
  or state Y has been continuously and profoundly affected as a direct result of the preceding event X,
  implying a significant, lasting transformation or condition. It highlights a strong cause-and-effect
  relationship leading to an ongoing, usually remarkable, state.
