    "etymology": "The structure 「を皮切りに」 combines 「を」 (the adverbial particle), 「皮切り」 (kawakiri, meaning \"beginning\" or \"outset\"), and 「に」 (the case-marking particle). The literal meaning of 「皮切り」 is \"to cut the hide,\" which evokes an image of making an initial cut to start something larger.",
    "writeup": "「を皮切りに」 (o kawakiri ni) indicates the starting point of something that then expands or continues. It translates to \"starting with (A)\" or \"beginning with (A).\" It is used with nouns or nominalized phrases to show how something developed after the initial point.\n\nVariations include 「にして」 (ni shite) and 「として」 (to shite) in place of 「に」 (ni), offering the same meaning.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   It's uncommon to use 「を皮切りに」 with natural phenomena or negative outcomes. The result of (A) is usually positive and has a specific 'doer'.\n*   While 「皮切り」 specifically means \"beginning,\" the kanji 「皮」 (hide) and 「切」 (cut) can help you remember the nuance of creating a starting point that leads to broader expansion, similar to skinning an animal.",
