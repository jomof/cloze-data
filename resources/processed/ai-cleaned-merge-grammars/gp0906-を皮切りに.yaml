        "[Noun] + を皮切りに": "Indicates a starting point, from which something expands or continues.",

        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "Indicates an initial event or action that serves as the starting point for a subsequent series of events or a broader development.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes that the event is not merely chronologically first, but actively triggers or initiates a significant, often expanding or continuous, progression. It implies a cause-and-effect relationship where the initial event sets the stage for further developments. Often used for positive or significant outcomes, but can also be used for negative chain reactions initiated by human action. Rarely used for natural phenomena."
    },
    "etymology": "The structure 「を皮切りに」 combines the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「皮切り」 (kawakiri), meaning \"beginning\" or \"outset,\" and the case-marking particle 「に」. The noun 「皮切り」 itself is derived from 「皮」 (kawa, \"hide\") and 「切る」 (kiru, \"to cut\"), literally meaning \"to cut the hide.\" This imagery evokes the act of making an initial cut to begin a larger process, such as skinning an animal, which then spreads out over a larger area. This etymology helps to understand the nuance of an initial action leading to a broader or expanded series of events.",
    "writeup": "「を皮切りに」 (o kawakiri ni) is a grammar pattern that denotes the beginning of a sequence of events or a process that subsequently expands or continues. It can be translated as \"starting with (A)\" or \"beginning with (A).\" This pattern is used when a specific event or action acts as a clear trigger or catalyst for something else to happen on a larger scale or over a sustained period.\n\nIt typically attaches to nouns or nominalized phrases. For example, a verb or i-adjective in its plain form can be nominalized by adding 「の」 (no) before 「を皮切りに」.\n\n**Variations:**\nIn place of 「に」, variations such as 「にして」 and 「として」 can also be used, carrying largely the same meaning but sometimes implying a slightly more formal or definitive nuance for the starting point:\n*   **を皮切りに**: The most common and general form.\n*   **を皮切りにして**: Often implies a definitive or specific starting action, sometimes with a slightly stronger causal link.\n*   **を皮切りとして**: Tends to be more formal and suggests that the initial point is established as a foundation or precedent for what follows.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   This pattern is primarily used for events initiated by human actions or significant occurrences, rather than natural phenomena. For instance, you would not typically say 「雨を皮切りに」 (starting with the rain) to describe a natural sequence of weather.\n*   While it often introduces a positive or significant development, it can also be used for chain reactions that lead to negative outcomes, as long as a clear initial action or event triggers the subsequent spread.\n*   The subsequent events or developments that follow the initial point are typically substantial and often involve expansion, increase, or proliferation.",
