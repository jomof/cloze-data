It is a simplified and commonly used form of 「ところにある」 (to be located in a place).\n\nThis pattern is often used when providing directions, discussing commute times, or generally describing the proximity and accessibility of a place. The structure typically involves:\n*   **[Place] は/が**: The location being described.\n*   **[Starting Point] から**: The reference point from which travel time is measured.\n*   **[Means of Transport] で**: The mode of transportation used (e.g., 歩いて for walking, バスで for by bus, 車で for by car).\n*   **[Time] の ところだ**: The duration of travel, followed by 「の」 and 「ところだ」.\n\nIt conveys not just a duration, but that the destination *is* at that specific travel-time-defined location.",
