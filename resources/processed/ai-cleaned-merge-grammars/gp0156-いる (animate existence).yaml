  jlpt: N5
  details:
    part-of-speech: verb
    usage-context: Used for living things, such as people and animals.
    counterpoint: The counterpart for inanimate objects and places is 「ある」
  etymology: The verb 「いる」 originates from classical Japanese and has consistently served to express the
    existence or presence of animate beings. Historically, it contrasted with 「ある」, which denoted the existence
    of inanimate objects or locations. While 「ある」 could sometimes imply animate existence in older forms,
    「いる」 specifically evolved to emphasize the living, moving presence of individuals and animals, solidifying
    this semantic distinction in modern Japanese.
  writeup: The verb 「いる」 is used to indicate the existence or location of animate objects such as people
    and animals. It is essential to remember that 「いる」 is **only** used for living things. For inanimate
    objects, use 「ある」. This is a fundamental distinction in Japanese grammar.
  false_friends:
    - term: ある
      meaning: to exist (inanimate objects); to have
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「いる」, 「ある」 is used for inanimate objects, plants, and abstract concepts. For example,
        「ペンがある」 (There is a pen) vs. 「人がいる」 (There is a person).
      grammar_point: ある (to exist or have)
    - term: 存在する
      meaning: to exist; to be present; to subsist
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「存在する」 also means 'to exist,' it is a more formal or academic term used for general
        existence, without the animate/inanimate distinction of 「いる」 and 「ある」. It often refers to concepts,
        phenomena, or abstract entities.
      grammar_point: <suggest>:存在する (general existence)
  post_false_friends_writeup: It is crucial to distinguish between 「いる」 and 「ある」. If you are referring to
    a living being such as a person or an animal, you must use 「いる」. Conversely, for inanimate objects,
    plants, or abstract concepts, 「ある」 is the correct choice. Confusing these two fundamental verbs will
    result in unnatural and incorrect Japanese. Additionally, while 「存在する」 also means 'to exist,' it lacks
    the animate/inanimate specificity of 「いる」 and 「ある」 and is reserved for more formal or abstract contexts,
    such as the existence of a theory or a species, rather than the everyday presence of a person or object.
  examples:
    - english: A child is in the park.
      japanese:
        - 子供 が 公園 に {いる}。
        - 公園 に 子供 が {いる}。
      english_literally: Child existing in park.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 子供 が 公園 に {ある}。
          english: A child exists (inanimate) in the park.
          hint: 「ある」 is used for inanimate objects or plants. We need a verb for an animate being like a
            child.
      scene: Observing a common sight in a neighborhood park.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      nuance: The use of the plain form 「いる」 in this example makes it a straightforward, factual statement
        about the child's presence. It is casual and common in everyday conversation.
    - english: The pet cat is in the room.
      japanese:
        - 飼い猫 が 部屋 に {い ます}。
        - 部屋 に 飼い猫 が {い ます}。
        - 飼い猫、部屋 に {いる} よ。
      english_literally: Pet cat existing in room (polite).
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 飼い猫 が 部屋 に {あり ます}。
          english: The pet cat exists (inanimate) in the room.
          hint: 「あります」 is for inanimate objects. For living beings like a cat, you need the polite form
            of 「いる」.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 飼い猫 が 部屋 に 滞在 {し て い ます}。
          english: The pet cat is staying in the room.
          hint: 「滞在しています」 implies a temporary stay. We are just stating the cat's simple presence.
      scene: A family member informing another about the cat's whereabouts.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: friendly
      conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: The polite form 「います」 is appropriate for polite conversation. Adding 「よ」 to 「いる」 in the last
        Japanese example, 「飼い猫、部屋にいるよ」, makes it more casual and adds emphasis or confirmation.
    - english: There are no students in the classroom.
      japanese:
        - 教室 に 生徒 が 誰 も {い ない}。
        - 生徒 が 誰 も 教室 に {い ない}。

            - 教室 に 生徒 が 誰 も {ない}。
          english: There are no students (inanimate) in the classroom.
          hint: 「ない」 is the negative of 「ある」 for inanimate objects. For living beings, use the negative
            of 「いる」.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 教室 に 生徒 が 誰 も {い ませ ん} か？
          english: Are there no students in the classroom?
          hint: Adding 「か」 makes it a question. We're looking for a plain negative statement.
      scene: A teacher arriving to an empty classroom.
      register: casual
      setting: serious
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      listener_gender: no one
      nuance: The plain negative form 「いない」 is used for a direct, casual statement. The polite version 「いません」
        maintains politeness while conveying the same lack of presence. The word order can be flexible.

      japanese:

          english: Last night, a famous singer existed (inanimate) at this bar.

            - 昨夜、この バー に 有名 な 歌手 が 来 て {い まし た}。
          english: Last night, a famous singer had come and was there at this bar.
          hint: 「来ていました」 emphasizes the action of coming and being present. We are simply stating that the
            singer was there.
      scene: Friends discussing a past event and a celebrity sighting.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: storytelling
      conjugation: past polite (～ました)
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: The polite past form 「いました」 is appropriate for polite narrative, often used when sharing an
        experience. The plain past 「いた」 is more casual, as typically used among close friends.
    - english: If he were at home, I could sleep soundly.
      japanese:
        - 彼 は 家 に {いれ ば}、安心 し て 寝 られる の に。

            - 彼 は 家 に {あれ ば}、安心 し て 寝 られる の に。
          english: If he (inanimate) were at home, I could sleep soundly.
          hint: 「あれば」 is the conditional of 「ある」 for inanimate objects. For a person, use the conditional
            of 「いる」.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 が 家 に い たら、安心 し て 寝 られる の に。
          english: If he were at home, I could sleep soundly.
          hint: While 「～たら」 can also express a conditional, 「～ば」 in this context often implies a more general
            or habitual condition for an outcome. We're looking for a conditional that highlights a longing
            or desire based on an ongoing state.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 が 家 に い て くれれ ば、安心 し て 寝 られる の に。
          english: If he were to be at home for my sake, I could sleep soundly.
          hint: Adding 「いてくれれば」 implies that his presence is a favor or benefit to the speaker. We are just
            stating a simple hypothetical condition.
      scene: A worried parent expressing their concern about their child who is out late.
      register: casual
      setting: melancholic
      conjugation: conditional (～ば)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: no one
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: The conditional form 「いれば」 expresses a hypothetical condition, conveying a sense of longing
        or wish. The addition of 「もし」 (moshi) at the beginning of the second Japanese example, 「もし 彼が 家にいるなら」,
        further emphasizes the hypothetical nature. The tone is casual and expresses personal anxiety.
    - english: A cat was by his side, looking very happy.
      japanese:
        - 彼 の 側 に 猫 が {い て}、とても 幸せ そう だっ た。
        - 猫 が 彼 の 側 に {い て}、とても 幸せ そう だっ た。

            - 彼 の 側 に 猫 が {あっ て}、とても 幸せ そう だっ た。
          english: A cat existed (inanimate) by his side, looking very happy.
          hint: 「あって」 is the te-form of 「ある」 for inanimate objects. For a living being like a cat, use the
            te-form of 「いる」.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 の 側 に 猫 が 座っ て {い て}、とても 幸せ そう だっ た。
          english: A cat was sitting by his side, looking very happy.

            of being present.
      scene: Observing a peaceful scene of a person and their pet.
      register: casual
      setting: reflective
      conjugation: te-form (～て)
      listener_gender: no one
      nuance: The te-form 「いて」 connects two clauses, describing the cat's presence and its appearance. The
        polite te-form 「いまして」 and polite past tense 「でした」 in the last Japanese example, 「彼の 側に 猫が{いまして}、とても
        幸せそうでした」, makes the description more formal or suitable for a respectful observation.

          english: Is there still no one (inanimate) in the meeting room?

            polite of 「いる」.

            - 会議 室 に まだ 誰 も 来 て {い ませ ん} か？
          english: Hasn't anyone arrived yet in the meeting room?
          hint: 「来ていませんか」 implies an action of coming. We are asking about mere presence or existence.
      scene: An office worker checking if a meeting is about to start or has already begun.
      register: formal
      setting: interrogative
      conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: The polite negative interrogative 「いませんか」 is suitable for a formal office setting, maintaining
        politeness while asking about the presence of others. The casual version 「いない」 is used among close
        colleagues or in less formal situations.
    - english: Let's always be together.
      japanese:
        - いつ も 一緒 に {い ましょう}。

        - competing_japanese:
            - いつ も 一緒 に {いよう}。
          english: Let's always be together (casual).
          hint: 「いよう」 is the plain volitional form, suitable for very close friends or family. We're looking
            for a slightly more polite tone.
        - competing_japanese:
            - いつ も 一緒 に {あり ましょう}。
          english: Let's always exist (inanimate) together.
          hint: 「ありましょう」 is the volitional of 「ある」, which is for inanimate objects. We're talking about
            people being together.
      scene: A couple expressing their devotion and commitment to each other.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: intimate
      conjugation: volitional polite (～ましょう)
      nuance: The polite volitional 「いましょう」 conveys a gentle invitation or proposal to continue being together.
        While intimate in context, the polite form adds a touch of respect or formality, often used between
        partners or close friends who still maintain a degree of politeness.

          english: My cat (inanimate) was not home yesterday.
          hint: 「なかった」 is the negative past of 「ある」, for inanimate objects. A cat is an animate being.
      scene: Someone explaining why their cat wasn't around when a friend visited.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
      nuance: The plain negative past 「いなかった」 is a direct and casual way to state the absence of an animate
        being in the past. It is commonly used among family and close friends.
    - english: The teacher wasn't here last week.
      japanese:
        - 先生 は 先週 ここ に {い ませ ん でし た}。
        - 先週、先生 は ここ に {い ませ ん でし た}。

          hint: 「いなかった」 is the plain negative past form. We need a polite expression suitable for a more
            formal setting.

            - 先生 は 先週 ここ に {あり ませ ん でし た}。
          english: The teacher (inanimate) wasn't here last week.
          hint: 「ありませんでした」 is for inanimate objects. For a person, use the polite negative past of 「いる」.
      scene: A student explaining to another student or a staff member why they couldn't ask a question
        to the teacher.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: informative
      conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)
      nuance: The polite negative past form 「いませんでした」 is appropriate for polite communication, such as when
        speaking to another student you don't know well, or a staff member. It respectfully conveys the
        absence of an animate person in the past.
  post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate the versatility of 「いる」 across different registers and contexts.
    Pay close attention to the animate/inanimate distinction when choosing between 「いる」 and 「ある」, as this
    is a cornerstone of accurate Japanese expression. Practice using the various conjugations to internalize
    their meanings and appropriate usage.
