details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: semi-formal
  nuance: 「やっと」 indicates that an event occurred after a long wait or with great effort, often conveying
    a sense of relief or satisfaction. It can also mean 'barely' or 'just enough' when describing a minimum
    requirement or capacity being met. This sense of relief or just-enough is often implied.
  colocation: Often collocates with verbs expressing completion, achievement, or reaching a state (e.g.,
    終わる, 間に合う, できる, 着く).
  grammatical-role: Modifies verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses.
  logical-flow: Implies a preceding period of waiting or difficulty.
  temporal-flow: Indicates the culmination of an event after a certain duration.
  spatial-flow: Can sometimes refer to a minimum spatial requirement being met.
etymology: The etymology of 「やっと」 is uncertain, but it is believed to be related to the verb 「止む (yamu)」,
  meaning "to stop." The idea is that after a long period of something continuing, it finally stops or
  comes to an end, allowing something else to happen.
writeup: 「やっと」 is an adverb used to express that something desirable has finally happened after a long
  wait, much effort, or some difficulty. It conveys a strong sense of relief or satisfaction that a goal
  has been reached, even if it was challenging. It can also mean "barely" or "just enough," indicating
  that a minimum requirement has been met or that one's ability is at its limit. This adverb is versatile
  and can be used in both casual and polite speech. While it can often be interchangeable with 「ようやく」,
  「やっと」 tends to carry a stronger emotional nuance of relief or personal accomplishment. When used to
  mean "barely," it highlights the narrowness of the margin or the extreme effort involved to meet a condition.
  It is distinct from 「とうとう」, which often implies an inevitable or expected outcome, and 「かろうじて」, which
  strictly focuses on the narrow margin of success, rather than the emotional relief or simple achievement
  after waiting.
false_friends:
  - term: とうとう
    meaning: finally, eventually, after all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「やっと」, 「とうとう」 often implies a result that was expected or inevitable, not necessarily
      desirable, or the conclusion of a negative situation.
    grammar_point: とうとう (finally・eventually)
  - term: ようやく
    meaning: finally, at last
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようやく」 is similar to 「やっと」, but it tends to emphasize the length of time or difficulty involved
      more strongly and is generally more formal or literary. It doesn't carry the same emotional relief
      as 「やっと」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ようやく (finally)
  - term: かろうじて
    meaning: barely, narrowly, by a hair's breadth
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「かろうじて」 focuses on the narrow margin by which something was achieved, emphasizing a near-failure
      or close call. 「やっと」 can also mean 'barely', but it more broadly indicates a minimum condition being
      met or relief at reaching a certain point.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:かろうじて (barely)
  - term: ぎりぎり
    meaning: at the absolute limit, just barely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「やっと」 can mean 'barely' with a sense of relief, 「ぎりぎり」 emphasizes being at the extreme
      edge of a limit, often implying no margin for error or a very tight squeeze.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ぎりぎり (at the limit)
  - term: 何とか
    meaning: somehow, in some way or another
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「何とか」 (or 「どうにか」) implies overcoming a challenge with effort, but it focuses on the method
      ('somehow') rather than the relief of completion or the strict 'barely' aspect that 「やっと」 can carry.
    grammar_point: 何とか (somehow manage)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「やっと」 emphasizes the relief or satisfaction
  of achieving something after a wait or difficulty, or the minimum requirement being met. 「とうとう」 suggests
  an an expected or inevitable outcome, 「ようやく」 highlights the long duration or difficulty, and 「かろうじて」
  emphasizes the narrow margin of success, often implying a near-failure.
examples:
  - english: The difficult exam is over, and I finally calmed down.
    japanese:
      - 難しかっ た 試験 が 終わっ て、{やっと} 落ち着き まし た。
      - 難しかっ た 試験 が 終わっ て、{やっと} 落ち着い た。
      - 難しい 試験 が 終わっ て、{やっと} 落ち着け た よ。
      - 難しかっ た 試験 も 終わっ て、{やっと} 一息 つけ まし た。

          - 難しかっ た 試験 が 終わっ て、{とうとう} 落ち着き まし た。
        english: The difficult exam is over, and I finally (inevitably) calmed down.
        hint: 「とうとう」 suggests an inevitable outcome or a result that was expected, often with a slightly
          more neutral or even negative connotation, not necessarily the sense of relief that 「やっと」 provides.
    scene: A student expressing relief after finishing a challenging test.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: This sentence expresses a personal feeling of relief after a difficult event. 「やっと」 perfectly
      captures this sense of emotional release and satisfaction. The polite form 「落ち着き まし た」 maintains
      a respectful tone.
    etymology: The verb 「落ち着く (ochitsuku)」 means to calm down or settle. The structure of the sentence
      with the te-form of 「終わる」 followed by 「やっと」 and 「落ち着く」 naturally flows to describe the sequence
      of events and the resulting emotion.
  - english: I finally managed to get my own house, which had been a dream for many years.
    japanese:

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 長年 の 夢 だっ た 自分 の 家 を {ようやく} 手 に 入れる こと が でき まし た。
        english: I finally (after a long time/difficulty) managed to get my own house, which had been
          a dream for many years.
        hint: 「ようやく」 strongly emphasizes the length of time or difficulty involved in achieving something,
          whereas 「やっと」 highlights the sense of relief or satisfaction upon completion.
    scene: Someone sharing the realization of a long-cherished personal goal.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: optimistic
    nuance: Here, 「やっと」 emphasizes the long-awaited achievement of a significant personal goal, conveying
      a strong sense of accomplishment and satisfaction after years of effort. The phrase 「手 に 入れる」 literally
      means 'to get into one's hand', implying acquisition.
    etymology: The expression 「手 に 入れる (te ni ireru)」 means to obtain or acquire. This phrasing emphasizes
      the active role of the speaker in finally achieving their dream, making the relief conveyed by 「やっと」
      particularly strong.
  - english: After the injury, just sitting down was all I could barely manage.
    japanese:

        english: After the injury, I could barely (by a narrow margin) manage to sit down.
        hint: 「かろうじて」 focuses on the narrow margin of success, implying a near-failure or extreme difficulty,
          while 「やっと」 in this context highlights that the basic action itself was the utmost limit.
    scene: Someone describing their physical limitation due to an injury.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: In this context, 「やっと」 signifies the absolute limit of one's ability, meaning 'barely' or
      'only just'. The casual past form 「だった」 fits the informal setting of discussing personal difficulties.
      The phrase 「座る の が やっとだ」 clearly indicates a struggle with even a basic action.
    etymology: The construction 「～のがやっとだ」 conveys the meaning of 'to be barely able to do something' or
      'it's all one can do'. The particle 「の」 nominalizes the verb 「座る」, making it the subject of the
      sentence, highlighting the difficulty of the action itself.
  - english: In this small room, there's barely enough space for just one bed.
    japanese:

        english: In this small room, there's just barely (at the absolute limit) enough space for one
          bed.
        hint: 「ぎりぎり」 emphasizes being at the absolute limit or margin, often implying no room to spare,
          while 「やっと」 here simply indicates that the minimum requirement is met with some effort or constraint.
    scene: A person explaining the limited space in their tiny apartment room.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: Here, 「やっと」 describes a minimum condition being met, meaning 'just enough' or 'barely'. The
      phrase 「入る だけ」 reinforces the idea of limited capacity. The casual form 「だ」 is appropriate for a
      straightforward description of a situation.
    etymology: The structure 「やっと～だけだ」 emphasizes that something is just barely sufficient or only just
      meets a minimum requirement. The word 「入る」 (to enter/fit) is commonly used when discussing space
      and objects fitting into it.
  - english: We got through the traffic jam, and with great effort, we finally arrived at the airport.
    japanese:

          - 渋滞 を 抜け て、{どう に か} 空港 に 着き まし た。
        english: We got through the traffic jam, and somehow managed to arrive at the airport.
        hint: 「どうにか」 means 'somehow' or 'in some way or another,' implying that something was achieved
          with effort but without explicitly emphasizing the difficulty or relief as strongly as 「やっとのことで」
          does.
    scene: Friends recalling a stressful journey to catch a flight.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: 「やっとのことで」 strongly emphasizes that the action was accomplished with significant difficulty
      and effort, often implying a sense of relief upon completion. The polite form 「着き まし た」 makes the
      narration suitable for sharing with others. The phrase 「渋滞 を 抜け て」 (to get through a traffic jam)
      clearly sets the scene of struggle.
    etymology: The phrase 「やっとのことで」 is a fixed expression that highlights extreme effort or difficulty
      in achieving something. It implies that the success was hard-won, which aligns with the meaning
      of 「やっと」 as indicating relief after struggle.
  - english: After waiting for hours, my turn finally came.
    japanese:

        english: After waiting for hours, my turn finally (after a long time) came.
        hint: 「ようやく」 highlights the length of time involved before something happened, often used in more
          formal contexts, whereas 「やっと」 emphasizes the relief or sense of achievement after a wait.
    scene: A patient at a clinic expressing their relief after a long wait.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: serious
    nuance: This sentence emphasizes the relief felt after a long period of waiting. 「やっと」 is particularly
      effective here in conveying the emotional satisfaction of the wait finally ending. The polite form
      「来 まし た」 maintains decorum in a public setting.
    etymology: The combination of a prolonged action (「待っ て」, waiting) followed by 「やっと」 and the culmination
      (「来 まし た」, came) is a classic pattern for 「やっと」, signifying an endpoint reached after a difficult
      or long preceding period.

        hint: 「かろうじて」 stresses that one barely succeeded, often implying a near-failure or extreme difficulty,
          while 「やっと」 here suggests reaching a minimal level after effort or time, with a nuance of modesty.
    scene: A language learner reflecting on their limited but improving Japanese ability.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「～できるようになりました」 emphasizes a gradual improvement, while 「やっと」 highlights that even
      after six months, the speaker's ability is still at a minimal level, expressing a modest or slightly
      self- deprecating tone. As a female speaker, this reflective tone might be slightly more common,
      conveying humility.
    etymology: The phrase 「できる よう に なる」 means to become able to do something. The adverb 「やっと」 preceding
      this phrase modifies the degree to which one is able to do it, implying that even this minimal ability
      was hard-won or took a long time to achieve.

        hint: 「かろうじて」 emphasizes that earning enough is a struggle and a near-miss, focusing on the difficulty

          do.
    scene: Someone discussing their financial struggles with a friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The polite form 「です」 maintains a respectful distance even when discussing personal struggles.
      For a male speaker, this phrase conveys a factual but resigned tone about the financial difficulty.
      The choice of 「得る」 (N3) is a neutral and polite way to say 'obtain' or 'earn', fitting the polite
      register.
    etymology: The construction 「～のがやっとです」 (or 「～のがやっとだ」 in plain form) is a common way to express that
      one can barely do something or that something is the utmost limit of one's ability. It emphasizes
      the bare minimum required to get by.

        english: After years of practice, I finally (after a long time) mastered playing the piano.
        hint: 「ようやく」 emphasizes the long duration of the process more than the emotional relief or personal
          accomplishment that 「やっと」 conveys.
    scene: A piano student reflecting on their long journey to master the instrument.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「やっと」 here conveys the speaker's sense of relief and achievement after a prolonged period
      of effort and practice, finally reaching a desired skill level. The use of 「～できるようになりました」 highlights
      the process of becoming able.
    etymology: The phrase 「できるようになる」 indicates the acquisition of a new ability over time. When combined
      with 「やっと」, it emphasizes that this ability was hard-won or took a significant amount of effort
      and patience to achieve.
  - english: With this small salary, I can barely pay my rent.

        english: With this small salary, I can barely (with great difficulty) pay my rent.
        hint: 「かろうじて」 focuses on the narrow margin of success, implying a near-failure or extreme difficulty,
          whereas 「やっと」 here simply indicates that reaching the minimum is the utmost limit of what one
          can do.
    scene: Someone expressing their financial struggles in a casual conversation.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: In this casual context, 「やっと」 is used to describe a situation where meeting a basic necessity
      (paying rent) is the absolute limit of one's financial capability, conveying a sense of hardship
      or constraint. The plain form 「だ」 is appropriate for a casual complaint.
    etymology: The structure 「～のがやっとだ」 conveys the idea that something is the maximum one can manage or
      that one can barely do something. 「払う」 (harau) means to pay, and 「家賃」 (yachin) refers to rent, forming
      a common context for discussing financial limits.
post_example_writeup: 'The examples provided illustrate the dual meaning of 「やっと」: first, as expressing
  relief or satisfaction when something long-awaited or difficult finally occurs; and second, as indicating
  a minimum or barely sufficient condition. Pay attention to the context to discern which nuance is intended.
  The phrase 「やっとのことで」 always emphasizes the great effort involved. The particles used with 「やっと」 often
  reflect the grammatical role of the modified phrase, whether it''s a verb, a nominalized clause, or
  a noun.'
