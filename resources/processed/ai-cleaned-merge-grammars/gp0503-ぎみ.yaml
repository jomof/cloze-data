    "etymology": "The suffix 「ぎみ」 originates from the noun 「気味 (きみ)」, which means \"sensation\" or \"feeling.\" The sound change from the initial 「き」 to 「ぎ」 (濁音化 - dakuon-ka, voicing) when used as a suffix serves to distinguish it from the standalone noun. This linguistic evolution highlights how grammatical particles and suffixes can adapt their phonology to signal a shift in their function, from a standalone word to a grammatical marker indicating a nuance of \"tendency\" or \"slightness.\"",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「ぎみ」 is used to convey a slight tendency, feeling, or sign of something. It is typically attached to nouns or the conjunctive (ます-form) of verbs. Common translations include \"looking (a little)\", \"feeling a little\", \"a touch of\", or \"slightly\".\n\n「ぎみ」 primarily refers to the subjective sensations or tendencies experienced by the speaker or observed by them. It can describe both one's own physical or emotional state (e.g., 疲れぎみ - feeling a little tired) and observations about others (e.g., 太りぎみ - looking a bit plump).\n\nA key characteristic of 「ぎみ」 is its ability to soften a statement. By indicating a *slight* degree or a *tendency* rather than a definitive state, the speaker avoids sounding overly assertive or direct. For example, saying 「風邪ぎみ」 (feeling a bit sick) is softer than 「風邪だ」 (I have a cold). This nuance is particularly useful in Japanese communication, which often values indirectness and subtlety.\n\n**Important Note**: Although it derives from the noun 「気味 (きみ)」, the suffix is always pronounced and written with a voiced sound, 「ぎみ」. This sound change is crucial for differentiating the grammatical suffix from the original noun.",

            "nuance": "A male manager uses 「積極性不足ぎみ」 to mildly critique a new employee's proactiveness. This phrasing softens the assessment, suggesting a slight tendency rather than a complete deficiency, making it more constructive. The use of 「必要だ」 is formal, while 「必要です」 provides a polite option.",
            "etymology": "「積極性不足」 (sekkyokusei fusoku) means lack of proactiveness. Adding 「ぎみ」 softens this direct assessment, implying a slight or emerging lack."

    "post_example_writeup": "As illustrated in these examples, 「ぎみ」 allows speakers to express conditions or tendencies with a delicate nuance, often softening the observation or self-assessment. It is particularly useful when you want to convey that something is not yet fully established but is subtly present or emerging.",
