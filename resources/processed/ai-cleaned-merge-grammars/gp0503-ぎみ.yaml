    "writeup": "The suffix 「ぎみ」, derived from the noun 「気味(きみ)」 meaning \"sensation\" or \"feeling\", is used to express a weak sign or tendency of something. It can be attached to nouns or the stem of verbs to convey a sense of \"a touch of\", \"feeling a little\", \"slightly\", or \"tending to\". For example, 「風邪(かぜ)気味(ぎみ)」 means \"feeling a bit under the weather\". 「ぎみ」 always uses a voiced 「ぎ」, distinguishing it from the noun 「気味(きみ)」.",
    "etymology": "「ぎみ」 comes from the noun 「気味(きみ)」 which means \"feeling,\" \"sensation,\" or \"state of mind.\" The change from 「き」 to 「ぎ」 is a phonetic change (連濁 rendaku) that often occurs when a word is attached as a suffix.",
