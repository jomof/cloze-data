    "etymology": "The suffix 「ぎみ」 comes from the noun 「気味（きみ）」, meaning \"sensation\" or \"feeling.\" The sound change from 「き」 to 「ぎ」 distinguishes the suffix from the original noun.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「ぎみ」 is attached to nouns or verb stems to indicate a slight tendency, feeling, or sign of something. It's often translated as \"looking (a little)\", \"feeling a little\", \"a touch of\", or \"slightly\". Because 「ぎみ」 describes a subjective sensation, it can refer to feelings about oneself or others. It also softens statements, making the speaker seem less assertive.",
