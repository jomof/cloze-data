    "etymology": "The suffix 「ぎみ」 comes from the noun 「気味（きみ）」, meaning \"sensation\" or \"feeling.\" The sound change from 「き」 to 「ぎ」 distinguishes the suffix from the original noun.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「ぎみ」 is attached to nouns or verb stems to indicate a slight tendency, feeling, or sign of something. It's often translated as \"looking (a little)\", \"feeling a little\", \"a touch of\", or \"slightly\". Because 「ぎみ」 describes a subjective sensation, it can refer to feelings about oneself or others. It also softens statements, making the speaker seem less assertive.",

                    "mitigation": "「太りぎみ」 implies a slight, internal feeling or tendency, which fits a personal resolution to diet. 「太っているようだ」 suggests an observation of being fat, which might not be the nuance of a slight, personal sensation."

            "nuance": "The speaker uses 「～なきゃ」, a casual contraction of 「～なければならない」, indicating a personal resolution. The phrase 「太りぎみ」 expresses a subjective feeling of slight weight gain, common in personal reflections on body image for a young woman."

                    "mitigation": "「疲れぎみ」 emphasizes a subtle, lingering fatigue rather than outright exhaustion, which is a common nuance when someone is 'a little' tired. 「疲れている」 is more definitive and might imply a stronger state of tiredness."

                    "mitigation": "「バテぎみ」 suggests a state where workers are approaching exhaustion, a slight tendency toward being worn out, making the decision to pause work appear proactive and preventative rather than a reaction to complete collapse. 「バテていた」 would imply they were already fully exhausted."
