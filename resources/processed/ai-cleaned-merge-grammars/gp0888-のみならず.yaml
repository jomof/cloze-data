    "etymology": "「のみならず」is derived from 「のみ」 (just, only), the negative form of the verb 「なる」 (naru, to become), and the archaic negative auxiliary verb 「ず」 (zu). Thus, it literally means \"not only becoming that\", implying that something goes beyond just one aspect.",
    "writeup": "「のみならず」 is a formal expression used to indicate \"not only...but also\" or \"what's more.\" It emphasizes that something is true in addition to another fact. It is often found in literature, formal writing, and speeches. It connects to nouns, verbs, and adjectives, similar to 「だけ」. When used at the beginning of a new sentence, it acts as a conjunction, meaning \"furthermore\" or \"moreover.\"",
