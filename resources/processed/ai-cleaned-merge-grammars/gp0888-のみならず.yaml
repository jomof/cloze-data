    },
    "etymology": "「のみならず」 is derived from 「のみ」 (only), the negative form of the verb 「なる」 (naru, to become) which is 「なら」, and the auxiliary verb 「ず」 (zu, not). Literally, it implies 'not only that it becomes [A], but also [B]'.",
    "writeup": "「のみならず」 is a formal expression used to indicate that something is \"not only A, but also B.\" It serves a similar function to 「だけでなく」 or 「ばかりでなく」, but carries a significantly more formal and literary tone. Its usage is typically restricted to written language, formal speeches, or academic discourse, making it less common in casual conversation.\n\nThis grammar point can connect to various parts of speech:\n*   **Nouns:** It attaches directly to nouns, often preceded by a particle (e.g., 「子供のみならず」 - not just children).\n*   **Verbs:** It connects to verbs in their plain forms (dictionary form, negative plain, past plain, negative past plain).\n*   **い-adjectives:** It attaches to い-adjectives in their plain forms (dictionary form, past plain).\n*   **な-adjectives and Nouns (with である):** For な-adjectives and nouns, 「である」 (the plain form of です) is inserted before 「のみならず」 to form the connection (e.g., 「有名であるのみならず」 - not only famous).\n\nAdditionally, 「のみならず」 can function as a conjunction, appearing at the beginning of a new sentence. In this role, it means \"furthermore,\" \"moreover,\" or \"what's more,\" adding a subsequent point or elaboration to a previous statement. Due to its inherent formality, it should be chosen carefully to match the appropriate register of communication. It signals a more elevated or authoritative tone compared to its less formal counterparts.",

            "nuance": "「ばかりでなく」 is less formal than 「のみならず」. Use it when you want to sound less stiff. It often implies the second item is an additional benefit or drawback."

            "nuance": "「に限らず」 often implies a wider scope or that something applies to more than just the specified category, suggesting a lack of limitation. This is subtly different from 「のみならず」's direct addition of another element."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ばかりでなく」, 「だけでなく」, 「に限らず」, 「だけでなく(て)〜も」, and 「はもとより」 share similar meanings with 「のみならず」, they have subtle differences in nuance and formality. 「ばかりでなく」 and 「だけでなく」 are considerably less formal and more common in everyday conversation. 「に限らず」 implies a broader application or scope. 「はもとより」 suggests the first item is an obvious given. Understanding these nuances will help you choose the most appropriate expression for your intended meaning and context. Take care not to confuse with 「だけ」, which means 「only」 and is a restrictive particle.",

            "register": "formal",

            "nuance": "The sentence employs formal vocabulary like 「破壊 する」 (to destroy) and 「深い 傷 を 残す」 (to leave deep scars), which are typical in journalistic or academic writing. The use of 「のみならず」 reinforces the seriousness of the topic, making the statement sound authoritative and impactful. The example uses the verb plain form formation.",
            "etymology": "The phrase 「深い傷を残す」 (fukai kizu o nokosu) literally means 'to leave deep wounds,' and is a common idiomatic expression used to describe lasting emotional or psychological damage, drawing a parallel to physical scars left on the body. This evokes a strong emotional response, fitting for a formal article discussing the impact of natural disasters beyond just physical destruction."

The phrase 「注意 が 必要 です」 (caution is necessary) further reinforces the instructional and cautionary nature. This example demonstrates the な-adjective stem formation.",
            "etymology": "「注意が必要」 (chūi ga hitsuyō) is a common fixed expression meaning 'caution is necessary' or 'attention is required.' Its origin is straightforward, combining 「注意」 (attention/caution) and 「必要」 (necessity), forming a direct and unambiguous warning, which is crucial in instructional contexts like a hiking brief."

The use of 「のみならず」 reinforces the comprehensive nature of the student's talents, appropriate for an academic report or discussion. This example uses the verb plain form formation.",
            "etymology": "The phrase 「成果を出す」 (seika o dasu) meaning 'to achieve results' or 'to produce results' is a standard formal expression. 「成果」 (seika) implies 'fruitful results' or 'achievements', often used in academic, business, or sports contexts to denote concrete, positive outcomes, reflecting a serious assessment of performance."

            "nuance": "The sentence begins with the formal 「彼女 は」 (she is) and uses 「熱心 に 取り組んでいる」 (actively engaged in) which conveys dedication. The combination of 「〜である のみならず」 presents both aspects of her public life with equal emphasis and a high degree of formality, suitable for a public address. This example uses the Noun + である formation.",

It's a relatively modern term that reflects increased corporate and individual engagement in philanthropy and community service.

The word 「多額」 (a large sum) further contributes to the formal and serious tone, underscoring the financial implications for the business. This example demonstrates the conjunctive formation.",
            "etymology": "「多額の費用」 (tagaku no hiyō) refers to 'a large sum of money for expenses.' 「多額」 is a formal word for 'large amount,' emphasizing the significant financial burden.
