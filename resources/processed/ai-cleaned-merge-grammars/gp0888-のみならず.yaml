    },
    "etymology": "「のみならず」is derived from 「のみ」 (only), the negative form of the verb 「なる」 (naru, to become) which is 「なら」, and the auxiliary verb 「ず」 (zu, not). Literally, it implies 'not only that it becomes [A], but also [B]'.",
    "writeup": "「のみならず」 is a formal expression indicating \"not only A, but also B.\" It's similar to 「だけでなく」 or 「ばかりでなく」, but more formal. It can connect to nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Occasionally, it can function as a conjunction at the beginning of a sentence, meaning \"furthermore\" or \"moreover.\" Because of its formality, it is primarily used in written language, formal speeches, or academic contexts. Consider it more stilted than 「だけでなく」 and choose it accordingly.",

            "japanese": "君の笑顔は太陽のように明るい{のみならず}、僕の心を温めてくれる。",

            "speaker_gender": "male",
            "listener_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "The use of 「君」 (kimi) by a male speaker to a female listener in this context indicates an intimate and somewhat affectionate tone. The overall flow is romantic and admiring, making it suitable for a flirty setting. This demonstrates that even formal expressions can be used in intimate contexts depending on the surrounding vocabulary and intention."

            "japanese": "このお店は料理が美味しい{のみならず}、居心地も良いですね。",

            "register": "teineigo (polite)",
            "setting": "first-date",
            "nuance": "The polite ending 「〜ですね」 adds a polite, slightly inquiring, and appreciative tone suitable for a first date where both parties are still establishing rapport. This demonstrates how 「のみならず」 can be integrated into polite conversational Japanese."

            "nuance": "This sentence uses straightforward, formal vocabulary like 「吸う人」 (suu hito - smoker) and 「害がある」 (gai ga aru - is harmful), fitting the grave and serious topic of public health. The phrase structure with 「のみならず」 emphasizes the broad negative impact of the action."

The ending 「〜のよ」 (no yo) is a common feminine sentence-final particle used to add emphasis or a gentle explanatory tone, typical of an older female speaking to a younger male in a caring context. This example combines a formal grammar point with intimate, gender-specific linguistic markers, showcasing the versatility of Japanese expression."
