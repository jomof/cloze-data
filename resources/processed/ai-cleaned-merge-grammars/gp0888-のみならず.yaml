    },
    "etymology": "「のみならず」 is derived from 「のみ」 (only), the negative form of the verb 「なる」 (naru, to become) which is 「なら」, and the auxiliary verb 「ず」 (zu, not). Literally, it implies 'not only that it becomes [A], but also [B]'.",
    "writeup": "「のみならず」 is a formal expression used to indicate that something is \"not only A, but also B.\" It serves a similar function to 「だけでなく」 or 「ばかりでなく」, but carries a significantly more formal and literary tone. Its usage is typically restricted to written language, formal speeches, or academic discourse, making it less common in casual conversation.\n\nThis grammar point can connect to various parts of speech:\n*   **Nouns:** It attaches directly to nouns, or to nouns followed by 「である」.\n*   **Verbs:** It connects to verbs in their plain forms (dictionary form, negative plain, past plain, negative past plain).\n*   **い-adjectives:** It attaches to い-adjectives in their plain forms (dictionary form, past plain).\n*   **な-adjectives:** It attaches to な-adjectives in their plain forms (e.g., 静かなのみならず).\n\nAdditionally, 「のみならず」 can function as a conjunction, appearing at the beginning of a new sentence. In this role, it means \"furthermore,\" \"moreover,\" or \"what's more,\" adding a subsequent point or elaboration to a previous statement. Due to its inherent formality, it should be chosen carefully to match the appropriate register of communication. It signals a more elevated or authoritative tone compared to its less formal counterparts.",

Understanding these nuances will help you choose the most appropriate expression for your intended meaning and context.

The use of 「のみならず」 reinforces the seriousness of the topic, making the statement sound authoritative and impactful. The example uses the verb plain form formation.",
            "etymology": "The phrase 「深い傷を残す」 (fukai kizu o nokosu) literally means 'to leave deep wounds,' and is a common idiomatic expression used to describe lasting emotional or psychological damage, drawing a parallel to physical scars left on the body.

The phrase 「注意 が 必要 です」 (caution is necessary) further reinforces the instructional and cautionary nature. This example demonstrates the な-adjective plain form formation.",
            "etymology": "「注意が必要」 (chūi ga hitsuyō) is a common fixed expression meaning 'caution is necessary' or 'attention is required.' Its origin is straightforward, combining 「注意」 (attention/caution) and 「必要」 (necessity), forming a direct and unambiguous warning, which is crucial in instructional contexts like a hiking brief."

            "etymology": "The phrase 「成果を出す」 (seika o dasu) meaning 'to achieve results' or 'to produce results' is a standard formal expression. 「成果」 (seika) implies 'fruitful results' or 'achievements', often used in academic, business, or sports contexts to denote concrete, positive outcomes, reflecting a serious assessment of performance."
