    },
    "etymology": "「のみならず」is derived from 「のみ」 (only), the negative form of the verb 「なる」 (naru, to become) which is 「なら」, and the auxiliary verb 「ず」 (zu, not). Literally, it implies 'not only that it becomes [A], but also [B]'.",
    "writeup": "「のみならず」 is a formal expression indicating \"not only A, but also B.\" It's similar to 「だけでなく」 or 「ばかりでなく」, but more formal. It can connect to nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Occasionally, it can function as a conjunction at the beginning of a sentence, meaning \"furthermore\" or \"moreover.\" Because of its formality, it is primarily used in written language, formal speeches, or academic contexts. Consider it more stilted than 「だけでなく」 and choose it accordingly.",

            "japanese": "君の笑顔は太陽のように明るい{のみならず}、僕の心を温めてくれる。",

                {
                    "competing_grammar": "君の笑顔は太陽のように明るいだけでなく、僕の心を温めてくれる。",
                    "mitigation": "The context of a man complimenting a woman in an intimate, flirty way, using somewhat poetic language, suggests a desire for a slightly more elevated and less casual expression than the common 「だけでなく」. 「のみならず」 lends a touch of depth and seriousness to the compliment, even in an intimate setting."
                },
                {
                    "competing_grammar": "君の笑顔は太陽のように明るいばかりでなく、僕の心を温めてくれる。",
                    "mitigation": "While 「ばかりでなく」 is also possible, it often carries a more straightforward additive nuance. Here, the slightly more formal 「のみならず」 emphasizes the profound dual impact of the smile, fitting the 'flirty' yet sincere tone better than the more casual 「ばかりでなく」."

The overall flow is romantic and admiring, making it suitable for a flirty setting. This demonstrates that even formal expressions can be used in intimate contexts depending on the surrounding vocabulary and intention."
