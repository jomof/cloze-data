    "etymology": "「のみならず」 is derived from 「のみ」 (only), the negative form of the verb 「なる」 (naru, to become) which is 「なら」, and the auxiliary verb 「ず」 (zu, not). Literally, it implies 'not only that it becomes [A], but also [B]'.",
    "writeup": "「のみならず」 is a formal expression used to indicate that something is \"not only A, but also B.\" It serves a similar function to 「だけでなく」 or 「ばかりでなく」, but carries a significantly more formal and literary tone. Its usage is typically restricted to written language, formal speeches, or academic discourse, making it less common in casual conversation.\n\nThis grammar point can connect to various parts of speech:\n*   **Nouns:** It attaches directly to nouns, or to nouns followed by 「である」.\n*   **Verbs:** It connects to verbs in their plain forms (dictionary form, negative plain, past plain, negative past plain).\n*   **い-adjectives:** It attaches to い-adjectives in their plain forms (dictionary form, past plain).\n*   **な-adjectives:** It attaches to な-adjectives in their plain forms (e.g., 静かなのみならず).\n\nAdditionally, 「のみならず」 can function as a conjunction, appearing at the beginning of a new sentence. In this role, it means \"furthermore,\" \"moreover,\" or \"what's more,\" adding a subsequent point or elaboration to a previous statement. Due to its inherent formality, it should be chosen carefully to match the appropriate register of communication. It signals a more elevated or authoritative tone compared to its less formal counterparts.",
