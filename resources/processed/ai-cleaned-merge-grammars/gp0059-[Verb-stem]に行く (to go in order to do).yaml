pronunciation:

formation:
  Verb (masu-stem) + に + 行く: Indicates going somewhere to perform a specific action, focusing on the purpose
    of the movement.
  Noun (action/purpose) + に + 行く: Used to express the purpose of movement with an activity or purpose
    noun (e.g., shopping, walking).
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  usage-context: General use for expressing the purpose of movement. Can be conjugated to casual or polite
    forms.
  function: Expresses the purpose or objective of an action, especially motion.
  colocation: Frequently used with action nouns or verbs in their masu-stem form. Primarily used with
    the verb 行く (iku).
  grammatical-role: Indicates the purpose or objective of the verb of movement 行く.
  logical-flow: The purpose indicated by に precedes the main action; the main action (going) is performed
    with that purpose in mind.
  spatial-flow: Implies movement towards a location where the stated purpose will be carried out.
etymology: The grammar point 「Verb-stem に行く」 combines a verb stem or an action noun with the particle
  「に」 and the verb 「行く」 (to go). The particle 「に」 generally signifies direction, location, or a point
  in time, and its use here to indicate purpose is an extension of this fundamental meaning. The "purpose"
  is conceptually the "destination" or "aim" of the action. So, in 「食べに行く」 (to go to eat), 「食べ」 (eating)
  is the target or goal that the 「行く」 (going) is directed towards. This construction, along with similar
  ones using other verbs of movement like 「来る」 (kuru) or 「帰る」 (kaeru), reflects how the Japanese language
  precisely expresses the intention behind a movement.
writeup: |-
  「Verb-stem に行く」 is used to express the act of going somewhere for a specific purpose. The verb preceding 「に」 must be in its masu-stem form (e.g., 読み、買い、見), or it can be directly attached to an action noun (e.g., 買い物, 散歩). This construction translates to "to go to do something" or "to go in order to do something."

  The particle 「に」 here is crucial; it explicitly marks the purpose or objective of the movement, distinguishing it from simply stating a destination. For instance, while 「学校 へ 行く」 (go to school) states a destination, 「買い物 に 行く」 (go to shop) specifies the reason for going. This construction is a fundamental way to express intention and movement in Japanese, reflecting the importance of purpose in action.

  This grammar point can be conjugated to various forms (e.g., に行きます, に行った, に行こう) depending on the tense, politeness level, and speaker's intent. While this specific grammar point focuses on the verb 「行く」 (to go), it is conceptually similar to constructions with 「来る」 (to come) or 「帰る」 (to return) used to express the purpose of coming or returning.
false_friends:
  - term: へいく
    meaning: To go to, To head toward
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「へ行く」 simply indicates the destination using the directional particle 「へ」 and doesn't imply
      the specific purpose of going for an action, unlike 「Verb-stem に行く」. For example, 「学校 へ 行く」 means
      'go to school,' but doesn't specify *why* you're going there beyond attending. In contrast, 「買い出し
      に 行く」 means 'go to buy supplies,' clearly stating the purpose.
    grammar_point: へ (directional particle)
  - term: ていく
    meaning: To ~ and go, To start
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ていく」 indicates a continuous action or a change over time, or an action performed as one moves
      away. It focuses on the manner or progression of an action, while 「Verb-stem に行く」 focuses solely
      on the purpose of going somewhere to perform a specific action. For instance, 「歩いていく」 means 'go
      by walking,' focusing on the manner, not the purpose of the walking.
    grammar_point: 〜ていく (change toward future・movement away from speaker)
  - term: Verb (dictionary form)
    meaning: To do (action)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Simply using the verb in its dictionary form (e.g., 「映画 を 見る」) states the action itself without
      specifying movement for that purpose. 「Verb-stem に行く」 emphasizes that one is *going* somewhere to
      *perform* the action, adding the element of purposeful travel. 「映画 を 見る」 means 'watch a movie',
      whereas 「映画 を 見 に 行く」 means 'go to watch a movie'.
    grammar_point: Verb[dictionary] (dictionary form)
  - term: Verb+にくる
    meaning: To come to do something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「Verb-stem に行く」 implies movement *away* from the speaker to perform an action, 「Verb-stem
      に来る」 implies movement *towards* the speaker (or current location) to perform an action. Both specify
      purpose, but the direction of movement is opposite. For example, 「読みに来た」 means 'came to read', not
      'went to read'.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb+にくる (come to do)
  - term: ため・ために
    meaning: For the purpose of; in order to; because of; due to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Verb-stem に行く」 directly states the immediate objective of an action, especially movement.
      「ため・ために」 indicates a broader reason, cause, or more general goal. While often interchangeable in
      some contexts, 「に」 is more concise for direct purposes, especially with verbs of motion, whereas
      「ため」 can express a more abstract or indirect purpose, or a reason/cause. For example, 「パン を 買い に
      行く」 is direct, while 「健康 の ため に 運動 する」 (exercise for one's health) uses 「ため」 for a broader purpose.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary・Nounの]ために (for the purpose of)'
  - term: ように
    meaning: so that; in order to; in such a way that (purpose or desired state)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Verb-stem に行く」 specifies a direct action's objective, often linked to physical movement.
      「ように」 expresses a purpose to achieve a certain state or outcome, implying an effort to bring about
      a desired condition, or to do something *in a way that* something else happens. It's often used
      with potential forms or verbs expressing change. For instance, 「日本語 が 上手 に なる よう に 勉強 する」 (study
      so that one becomes good at Japanese) uses 「ように」 for a desired state.
    grammar_point: ように (purpose or desired state)
  - term: で (cause・reason)
    meaning: because of; due to; by
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「で (cause・reason)」 expresses the cause or reason for an event or state. In contrast, 「Verb-stem
      に行く」 expresses the objective or goal of an action involving movement. For example, 「風邪 で 学校 を 休む」
      (to miss school due to a cold) explains *why* you missed school, whereas 「本 を 買い に 出かける」 (to go
      out to buy a book) explains *what* your purpose is in going out.
    grammar_point: で (cause・reason)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  When choosing between these expressions, remember that 「Verb-stem に行く」 is singular in its focus: the purpose of the movement to a location. 「へ行く」 clarifies the destination without necessarily implying an action upon arrival. 「ていく」 describes how an action unfolds over time or extends away from the speaker. 「Verb-stem に来る」 and 「Verb-stem に帰る」 are similar in structure to 「Verb-stem に行く」 but indicate movement towards the speaker's location or back home, respectively.

  For broader purposes or reasons, 「ため」 is often more appropriate, while 「ように」 is used for achieving a desired state or outcome. The particle 「で」 indicates cause or means, not the purpose of movement.

      in many contexts, especially if the speaker were female or addressing someone of higher status.

      for informing others of one's plans.
post_example_writeup: The usage of 「Verb-stem に行く」 clearly specifies the purpose for which one undertakes
  a journey or movement. This construction is highly versatile and can be used with various verb stems
  and action nouns, always emphasizing the objective behind the action of going. Pay close attention to
  the verb stem or noun, as it forms the core of the intended activity. While less common, it can also
  be conjugated into imperative forms like 「にいけ」 (go to do!) or 「にいかなさい」 (go to do!), typically used when
  giving a direct command to someone to perform a specific action by going somewhere.
