id: gp0059
meaning: to go in order to do
pronunciation:
  katakana: ニイク
  romaji: ni iku
formation:
  Verb[ます-stem] + に + 行く: Indicates the primary purpose of going is to perform the indicated verb.
  Verb[ます-stem] + に + 来る: Indicates the primary purpose of coming is to perform the indicated verb.
  Verb[ます-stem] + に + 帰る: Indicates the primary purpose of returning is to perform the indicated verb.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The construction combines the ます-stem of a verb, which serves as a nominalized form representing
  the action, with the directional particle 「に」 and a verb of motion (行く, 来る, 帰る). The particle 「に」 in
  this context signifies the purpose or destination of the action, effectively translating to 'for the
  purpose of' or 'to do'. This pattern highlights that the movement is undertaken specifically to perform
  the action.
writeup: The grammar pattern 「Verb[ます-stem]に行く」is used to express the purpose of going to a certain place.
  It signifies that the act of going is for the specific reason of performing the action indicated by
  the ます-stem verb. This is a very common and fundamental way to state one's intention or objective when
  moving to a location. The particle 「に」 here functions similarly to "to" or "for the purpose of" in English,
  specifying the destination of the action. While most commonly seen with 行く (to go), it can also be used
  with 来る (to come) or 帰る (to return home), indicating the purpose of coming or returning. This pattern
  emphasizes the reason for the movement, making it clear why one is heading to a particular place.

  - term: '[Verb-dictionary]ために'
    meaning: for the purpose of, in order to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ために」can be used with a wider range of verbs and doesn't necessarily imply movement. It states
      a general purpose or reason. 「[Verb-stem]に行く」specifically links the purpose to the act of going/coming/returning.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-dictionary]ために (for the purpose of)
  - term: '[Verb-dictionary]ことにする'
    meaning: to decide to do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both express intention, 「[Verb-stem]に行く」states the purpose of movement, whereas 「ことにする」expresses
      a decision to do something, which may or may not involve movement.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ことにする (to decide to do)'
  - term: に (target・destination)
    meaning: to (direction)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The simple particle 「に」indicates a destination. 「[Verb-stem]に行く」adds the specific purpose
      of an action to be performed at that destination, not just simple movement.
    grammar_point: に (target・destination)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「Verb[ます-stem]に行く」and 「Verb[dictionary]ために」both express purpose, the
  former specifically implies movement for that purpose, emphasizing the act of going/coming/returning.
  For instance, 「買い物に行く」means "to go shopping," where going is directly linked to the act of shopping.
  In contrast, 「健康のために運動する」("to exercise for health") uses 「ために」to state a general purpose (health) for
  an action (exercising), which doesn't necessarily involve movement to a specific place for that purpose.
  Similarly, 「Verb[dictionary]ことにする」expresses a personal decision, not necessarily the purpose of a movement.
  Understanding these distinctions helps clarify which pattern to use based on whether you are emphasizing
  the purpose of a movement or a general reason/decision.

post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, this pattern is versatile and can be conjugated for tense
  and politeness like a regular verb of motion (行く, 来る, 帰る). It is crucial to remember that the verb immediately
  preceding 「に」must be in its ます-stem form, as this acts as the nominalized purpose of the movement.
