formation:
  '[Phrase] + とは限らない': Indicates that something is not necessarily the case or that there is no guarantee
    that something will happen.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: serious discourse
etymology: The grammar point 「とは限らない」 is composed of 「と」 (a particle indicating content), 「は」 (a topic
  marker), and 「限らない」 (the negative form of the verb 「限る」 to limit). Thus, it literally means "it is not
  limited to saying that".
writeup: The grammar point 「とは限らない」 is used to express that something is **not necessarily** the case
  or that there is **no guarantee** that something will happen. It signifies that while a certain outcome
  or state might seem expected or implied, it is not definitively true or always limited to that possibility.
  This expression is formed by taking the negative plain form of the verb 「限る」(かぎる), meaning 'to limit'
  or 'to be confined to', along with the particle 「と」, which introduces the content of what is being negated,
  and the topic marker 「は」. It literally conveys the idea that 'it is not limited to (or confined by)
  saying that...'. This structure can be appended to verbs, *i*-adjectives, *na*-adjectives, and nouns.
  When preceding 「とは限らない」, *na*-adjectives and nouns require the copula 「だ」 (or 「であった」 for past tense)
  before the 「と」 particle.
false_friends:
  - term: 限り
    meaning: As long as, while… is the case, limited to
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「とは限らない」, which expresses uncertainty, 「限り」 indicates a condition or limitation.
    grammar_point: 限り (as long as)
  - term: ことにはならない
    meaning: Just because… doesn't mean…
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ことにはならない」 is similar, but it focuses more on negating a direct cause-and-effect relationship.
    grammar_point: ことにはならない (doesn't mean)
  - term: というものでもない
    meaning: There is no guarantee that…, not necessarily
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「というものでもない」 is a softer way of expressing a similar idea, implying a lack of certainty.
    grammar_point: というものでもない (not necessarily)
  - term: というわけではない
    meaning: It is not that, it doesn't mean that, it is not always the case
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「というわけではない」 is very close in meaning but can also be used to correct a misunderstanding.
    grammar_point: というわけではない (not necessarily)
  - term: 必ずしも
    meaning: Not always, not entirely, not necessarily
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「必ずしも」 is an adverb that directly modifies the verb, while 「とは限らない」 is a more structural grammar
      point.
    grammar_point: 必ずしも (not necessarily)
  - term: ないことはない
    meaning: Is not impossible; It doesn't mean that it isn't
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ないことはない」 expresses possibility, while 「とは限らない」 expresses uncertainty.
    grammar_point: ないことはない (not impossible)
  - term: わけではない
    meaning: It doesn't mean that, it is not the case, it's not like
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「わけではない」 is similar to 「というわけではない」 and is used to negate a preceding statement or assumption.
    grammar_point: わけではない (not necessarily)
  - term: とは言えない
    meaning: Cannot say that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とは言えない」 directly states an inability to assert something, whereas 「とは限らない」 emphasizes that
      something is not necessarily true or guaranteed, often implying a possibility beyond a common assumption.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:とは言えない (cannot say that)
post_false_friends_writeup: While many of these expressions share similar meanings, it's important to
  note the nuances. 「とは限らない」 is a general statement of uncertainty, while others like 「ことにはならない」 and 「というわけではない」
  are more specific in negating a direct relationship or assumption. Consider the context to choose the
  most appropriate expression.
examples:
  - english: Just because you've lived in Japan for a long time doesn't necessarily mean you'll become
      good at Japanese.
    japanese:
      - 日本 に 長く 住ん で いる から と いっ て、日本 語 が 上手 に なる と {は 限ら ない}。
      - 日本 に 長く 住ん で いる から と いっ て、日本 語 が 上手 に なる と {は 限り ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Even if you say you have lived in Japan for a long time, it is not limited to Japanese
      becoming skillful.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 に 長く 住ん で いる から と いっ て、日本 語 が 上手 に なら ない。
        english: Just because you've lived in Japan for a long time doesn't mean you'll become good at
          Japanese (it won't).
        hint: This simply states that you won't become good, rather than saying it's not necessarily the
          case. We're looking for an an expression that implies it's not guaranteed, but still possible.
    scene: A student thinking about moving to Japan to improve their Japanese.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The speaker's reflective tone, suitable for a young student contemplating a future move, is
      conveyed by the simple plain form 「とは限らない」. This is a general statement of observation and does
      not target any specific listener. The phrase 「日本 語 が 上手 に なる と は 限ら ない」 implies that becoming good
      at Japanese is not guaranteed solely by living in Japan.
    etymology: The phrase 「からといって」 used before 「とは限らない」 emphasizes the 'just because... doesn't mean...'
      structure. 「から」 indicates reason, and 「といって」 is a contracted form of 「と言って」 meaning 'even if one
      says'.
  - english: Just because the weather is good doesn't necessarily mean it's warm.
    japanese:
      - 天気 が 良い から と いっ て、暖かい {と は 限ら ない}。
      - 天気 が 良い から と いっ て、暖かい {と は 限り ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Even if you say the weather is good, it is not limited to being warm.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 天気 が 良い から と いっ て、暖かく ない。
        english: Just because the weather is good, it's not warm.
        hint: This states a definite 'not warm'. We're looking for 'not necessarily warm', implying it
          might not be, even if the weather is good.
    scene: Two friends checking the weather forecast in early spring.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The casual tone and directness in 「とは限らない」 fit the friendly interaction between two younger
      individuals. The speaker is simply stating a common observation without formality. The phrase 「暖かい
      と は 限ら ない」 points out that the expected warmth despite good weather is not a certainty.
    etymology: 「からといって」 acts as a conjunction here, linking the premise ('the weather is good') to the
      nuanced negation. The phrase implies a counter-expectation.
  - english: Living in the countryside isn't necessarily quiet.
    japanese:
      - 田舎暮らし が 静か {だ と は 限ら ない}。
      - 田舎暮らし が 静か {だ と は 限り ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Countryside living is not limited to being quiet.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 田舎暮らし は 静か で は ない。
        english: Countryside living is not quiet.
        hint: This simply states that countryside living is not quiet. We need to express that it's 'not
          necessarily quiet', suggesting there might be exceptions or it's not always the case.
    scene: A city dweller is romanticizing country life, and a friend who lives there corrects them.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「だとは限らない」 emphasizes that the quietness of countryside living is not a given, directly
      addressing and correcting the romanticized notion of the city dweller. The speaker's slightly older
      age and experience lend authority to this informative correction. The particle 「が」 after 「田舎暮らし」
      marks it as the subject of the statement, while 「静か だ と は 限ら ない」 negates the absolute assumption
      of quietness.
    etymology: 「だ」 is the plain form of the copula, necessary when 「とは限らない」 follows a noun or a na-adjective
      like 「静か」 to connect it to the grammatical structure.
  - english: Just because someone is a company president doesn't necessarily mean they necessarily drive
      a luxury car.
    japanese:
      - 社長 だ から と いっ て、高級 車 に 乗る {と は 限ら ない}。
      - 社長 だ から と いっ て、高級 車 に 乗る {と は 限り ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Even if you say it's a company president, it is not limited to driving a luxury
      car.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 社長 だ から と いっ て、高級 車 に 乗ら ない。
        english: Just because someone is a company president, they don't drive a luxury car.
        hint: This implies they definitely don't drive one. We're looking for 'not necessarily', which
          leaves room for some presidents to drive one, but it's not a rule.
    scene: Colleagues are discussing their new, surprisingly frugal CEO.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「とは限らない」 in a formal setting among colleagues is appropriate for a statement that
      challenges a common assumption, especially when discussing a superior. The neutral form is common
      in informative discourse, and an older male speaker might use it to convey a sense of experience
      or wisdom. The phrase 「高級 車 に 乗る と は 限ら ない」 specifically negates the common assumption about presidents
      and luxury cars.
    etymology: 「社長 だからといって」 exemplifies a common pattern where 「だからといって」 (just because it's X, doesn't
      mean Y) precedes 「とは限らない」, setting up the expectation that is then negated.
  - english: It's not necessarily true that everyone can sing well.
    japanese:
      - 全員 が 上手 に 歌える {と は 限ら ない}。
      - 全員 が 上手 に 歌える {と は 限り ませ ん}。
    english_literally: It is not limited to all members being able to sing skillfully.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 全員 が 上手 に 歌え ない。
        english: It's true that everyone cannot sing well.
        hint: This expresses a definite inability for everyone to sing well. We want to say it's 'not
          necessarily true' that everyone can, implying some might not, but it's not a universal rule.
    scene: A choir director addressing their new members.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The formal and instructional setting uses 「とは限らない」 to set a realistic expectation. The female
      choir director, as an older figure, uses a direct but not overly harsh tone to address the new members,
      implying a need for practice and effort rather than inherent talent. 「上手 に 歌える と は 限ら ない」 means
      that the ability to sing well is not necessarily possessed by everyone.
    etymology: The structure 「全員 が ～ とは限らない」 is a common way to express that a quality or ability is not
      universally applicable to a group. It directly counteracts an assumption of uniformity.
  - english: Last winter, it didn't necessarily snow.
    japanese:
      - 去年 の 冬 は、必ず しも 雪 が 降る {と は 限ら なかっ た}。
      - 去年 の 冬 は、必ず しも 雪 が 降る {と は 限り ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: Last year's winter, it was not necessarily limited to snow falling.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 去年 の 冬 は、雪 が 降ら なかっ た。
        english: Last winter, it didn't snow.
        hint: This states definitively that it did not snow. We need to say it 'didn't necessarily snow',
          meaning it might have snowed at some points, but it wasn't a consistent occurrence as might
          be expected.
    scene: Two people reminiscing about an unusually mild winter.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of the past tense 「とは限らなかった」 clearly indicates that the unexpected situation occurred
      in the past. The addition of the adverb 「必ずしも」 reinforces the meaning 'not necessarily'. The casual
      register and male-to-male interaction are common for reflective discussions. 「雪 が 降る と は 限ら なかっ
      た」 signifies that snowfall was not a guaranteed occurrence, rather than a complete absence of snow.
    etymology: The combination of 「必ずしも」 and 「とは限らない」 emphasizes the lack of certainty. 「必ずしも」 intensifies
      the nuance of 'not necessarily' by explicitly stating that it was not always the case.
  - english: Even if she says she likes me, it doesn't necessarily mean we'll always be together.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 が『好き』と 言っ て くれ て も、ずっと 一緒 に い られる {と は 限ら ない}。
      - 彼女 が『好き』と 言っ て くれ て も、ずっと 一緒 に い られる {と は 限り ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Even if she says she likes me, it is not limited to being able to be together forever.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 が『好き』と 言っ て くれ て も、ずっと 一緒 に い られ ない。
        english: Even if she says she likes me, we can't always be together.
        hint: This implies a definite impossibility of always being together. We're looking for 'doesn't
          necessarily mean', which expresses a lack of guarantee or certainty, but not a complete impossibility.
    scene: A young man confiding in his older friend about relationship anxieties.
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The male speaker's use of 「好き」 instead of 「愛している」 for 'like/love', combined with 「いられる」 (potential
      form of 'to be'), conveys a more nuanced sense of romantic uncertainty common among younger males.
      This expresses a personal anxiety about the future rather than a definitive statement. The casual
      「とは限らない」 is appropriate for confiding in a close friend. The phrase 「ずっと 一緒 に い られる と は 限ら ない」 indicates
      that long-term togetherness is not a guaranteed outcome.
    etymology: The potential form 「いられる」 emphasizes the speaker's ability or capacity to be together,
      which is then negated by 「とは限らない」, expressing that the ability to be together indefinitely is not
      guaranteed.
  - english: Even if you become rich, there's no guarantee you'll be happy.
    japanese:
      - お 金持ち に なっ て も、幸福 に なれる {と は 限ら ない}。
      - お 金持ち に なっ て も、幸福 に なれる {と は 限り ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Even if you become a rich person, it is not limited to being able to become happy.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 金持ち に なっ て も、幸福 に なれ ない。
        english: Even if you become rich, you cannot be happy.
        hint: This states a definite inability to be happy. We need to express that there's 'no guarantee',
          meaning it's not a sure thing, but it's not necessarily impossible either.
    scene: A philosopher contemplating the true meaning of success.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The formal 「とは限らない」 aligns with the philosophical and reflective setting. An older speaker
      contemplating life's deeper meanings would use this phrase to express a universal truth that defies
      common assumptions. The neutral form is common for general observations. 「幸福 に なれる と は 限ら ない」 directly
      questions the common belief that wealth guarantees happiness.
    etymology: 「になっても」 acts as a concession, meaning 'even if it becomes X'. This sets up a contrast with
      the subsequent statement, which is then negated by 「とは限らない」, indicating that the expected outcome
      is not guaranteed.
  - english: What you say isn't necessarily always right, is it?
    japanese:
      - あなた の 言う こと が いつ も 正しい {と は 限ら ない} でしょう？
      - あなた の 言う こと が いつ も 正しい {と は 限り ませ ん} でしょう？
    english_literally: Your words are not necessarily always correct, right?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あなた の 言う こと は いつ も 正しく ない。
        english: What you say is always wrong.
        hint: This is a direct contradiction, stating that what is said is always wrong. We are looking
          for 'not necessarily always right', which means it might sometimes be wrong, but not every time.
    scene: A manager gently correcting a confident subordinate's overconfidence.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: persuasive
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The addition of 「でしょう」 softens the assertion, making it a gentle suggestion rather than a
      blunt correction. This indirect approach is appropriate for a semi-formal setting where the speaker
      (a manager) wants to maintain good relations while addressing a subordinate's overconfidence. It
      implies a seeking of agreement rather than a direct contradiction. The phrase 「いつ も 正しい」 is modified
      by 「とは限らない」 to convey that correctness is not constant.
    etymology: The combination with 「でしょう」 softens the assertion, making it more rhetorical or seeking
      agreement, rather than a definitive statement. This is a common way to convey politeness and indirectness
      in Japanese.
  - english: Just because something is expensive doesn't necessarily mean it's good.
    japanese:
      - 高い から と いっ て、良い {と は 限ら ない}。
      - 高い から と いっ て、良い {と は 限り ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Even if you say it's expensive, it is not limited to being good.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 高い から と いっ て、良く ない。
        english: Just because something is expensive, it is not good.
        hint: This is a definitive statement that something expensive is not good. We are looking for
          'not necessarily good', meaning it might not be good, but it's not a rule.
    scene: Two friends shopping for a gift, looking at a pricey item.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The casual use of 「とは限らない」 expresses a common piece of wisdom or observation among friends.
      The phrase 「高いからといって」 sets up the common assumption that higher price equals higher quality, which
      is then countered by the grammar point, implying that price is not the sole determinant of quality.
      「良い と は 限ら ない」 conveys that 'good' is not a necessary consequence of 'expensive'.
    etymology: 「高いからといって」 functions as a common introductory phrase to present a commonly held belief
      or situation that is then nuanced or contradicted by the main clause using 「とは限らない」. 「から」 indicates
      reason, and 「といって」 serves to introduce the preceding statement.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「とは限らない」 can be used in various contexts, from casual conversation
  to more formal discussions. Its conjugation depends on the tense of the sentence and the desired level
  of politeness. Remember that the core meaning of 'not necessarily' or 'no guarantee' remains consistent.
