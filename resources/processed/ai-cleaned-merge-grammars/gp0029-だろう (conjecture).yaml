    "etymology": "「だろう」 is derived from the copula 「だ」, combined with the volitional auxiliary 「う」. Over time, it evolved from expressing intention to expressing conjecture or probability. The polite form is 「でしょう」, stemming from 「です」.",
    "writeup": "「だろう」 is used to express the speaker's conjecture, probability, or uncertain assertion. It implies that the speaker thinks something is likely true but lacks definitive evidence. It's similar to saying \"probably\" or \"isn't it?\" in English.\n\nIt can be used after verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. For な-adjectives and nouns, 「だ」 or 「だった」 is often inserted directly before 「だろう」 to create a grammatically correct sentence, such as 「綺麗だろう」 (for a present state) or 「綺麗だったろう」 (for a past state).\n\n「だろう」 is generally considered more casual and can have a slightly more masculine nuance compared to 「でしょう」. While often used when the speaker has some information to support their assertion, it can also express a mere 'feeling' or 'hunch,' in which case it conveys low confidence, often indicated by the speaker's tone of voice.",

It is often used when the speaker is less confident in their conjecture, or when there is only a slim chance of something being true, whereas 「だろう」 implies a higher likelihood or a more general assumption. For example, 「雨 が 降る かもしれない」 (It might rain) suggests a slight chance, while 「雨 が 降る だろう」 (It will probably rain) indicates a stronger likelihood based on current signs like dark clouds. In conversations, 「かもしれない」 often implies the speaker is less certain, while 「だろう」 implies a higher degree of confidence or an expectation that the listener will agree with the conjecture due to shared context or observation, often leading to a question like 'isn't it?' in English. This subtle distinction in certainty and shared assumption is key to differentiating them.",

For example, 「彼 は 来る はずだ」 (He should come/is expected to come) suggests certainty based on a schedule or previous arrangement. In contrast, 「彼 は 来る だろう」 (He will probably come) is more of a general conjecture without necessarily strong backing. 「はずだ」 conveys objective certainty (or high probability), while 「だろう」 is subjective conjecture. 「はずだ」 is often used when the speaker is confident in their deduction due to logical reasons or established facts, while 「だろう」 is used when the speaker is making a general assumption, often based on less concrete evidence, or seeking agreement without asserting a strong conviction.

For example, 「雨 が 降る そうだ」 (I heard it will rain) reports information from a source, while 「雨 が 降る だろう」 (It will probably rain) is the speaker's own prediction. 「そうだ」 (appearance) expresses an impression based on visual information, unlike 「だろう」 which is about likelihood. For example, 「おいし そうだ」 (It looks delicious) is based on appearance, whereas 「おいしい だろう」 (It's probably delicious) is a conjecture about taste.

In contrast, 「寒い だろう」 (It's probably cold) is a prediction or assumption. 「ね」 functions to ensure shared understanding and confirm existing facts or perceptions, while 「だろう」 introduces new information in the form of a conjecture or seeks agreement on something that is not yet a shared certainty.

It adds a layer of politeness and tentativeness, making the speaker's opinion sound less direct and more open to consideration. It is often used in academic or business settings to propose an idea without sounding overly assertive, inviting constructive feedback.

While 「だろう」 can sound assertive or masculine, its usage as a simple conjecture is widespread across genders in casual contexts.
