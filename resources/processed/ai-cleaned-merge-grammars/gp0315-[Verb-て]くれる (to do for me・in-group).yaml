formation:
  Verb[て] + くれる: Indicates that someone performs an action for the speaker or someone in their in-group,
    implying gratitude.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The verb 「くれる」 originates from the verb 「呉れる」, which means 'to give.' When combined with the
  Te-form of another verb, it extends this meaning of 'giving' to 'giving an action' or 'doing a favor
  for.' The core concept remains that of an action being directed towards the speaker or their immediate
  in-group, always carrying the nuance of a benefit received, hence the inherent gratitude. This contrasts
  with other giving/receiving verbs that convey different directions or social implications.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「〜てくれる」 is used to express that someone performs an action for the benefit of the speaker or someone within the speaker's personal circle, such as family members or close friends. This construction inherently carries a nuance of gratitude or appreciation for the favor received. The person performing the action is the grammatical subject of 「くれる」, while the recipient of the favor (the speaker or in-group member) is typically the indirect object, often omitted if it is clear from context.

  For example, if a friend helps you, you would say 「友達が手伝って{くれた}」 (My friend helped me). The focus is on the beneficial action received. When expressing actions done by a superior or someone deserving of higher respect, the honorific form 「〜てくださる」 is used instead of 「〜てくれる」.

  It is essential to understand that the action always flows *towards* the speaker or their in-group. This directionality is key to distinguishing 「〜てくれる」 from other verbs of giving and receiving, such as 「〜てあげる」 and 「〜てもらう」.
false_friends:
  - term: '[Verb-て]あげる (to do for someone, outward)'
    meaning: to do something for someone (outside speaker's in-group)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てあげる」 expresses an action done by the speaker (or their in-group) for someone *outside*
      their in-group, implying a benefit given to the receiver. There is no implied gratitude from the
      speaker; rather, the speaker is the one bestowing the favor.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]あげる (to do for someone, outward)'
  - term: '[Verb-て]もらう (to have someone do, receive an action)'
    meaning: to have someone do something for oneself; to receive an action
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てもらう」 expresses that the speaker *receives* the favor or action from someone else. The focus
      is on the *receiver's* perspective. The subject is the receiver, and the person who performed the
      action is marked with に.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]もらう (to have someone do, receive an action)'
post_false_friends_writeup: These three expressions form a fundamental trio for understanding the dynamics
  of giving and receiving actions in Japanese. While 「〜てくれる」 focuses on an action being done *for* the
  speaker or their in-group (from an outsider), 「〜てあげる」 describes an action done *by* the speaker or their
  in-group *for* an outsider. Conversely, 「〜てもらう」 describes an action *received* by the speaker or their
  in-group (from an outsider). Mastering the correct usage depends entirely on the perspective of the
  speaker and the direction of the benefit.
