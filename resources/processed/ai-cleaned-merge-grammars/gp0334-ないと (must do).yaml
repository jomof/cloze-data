details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used among equals/close friends (casual speech)
  function: expresses obligation or necessity
etymology: This grammar point is a shortened version of 「ないといけない」. 「ない」 is the negative form of 「ある」 (to
  exist/be). 「と」 has a conditional meaning, and 「いけない」 means 'cannot go' or 'is not good'. So the literal
  meaning is close to 'if it is not, it is not good'.
writeup: 「ないと」 is a common contraction of the more complete phrases 「ないといけない」 or 「ないだと」. It conveys a
  strong sense of obligation or necessity, meaning something **must** be done, or one **has to** do something.
  This grammatical pattern implies that if the action is not performed, there will be a negative consequence
  or it will be **problematic**. This contraction is most commonly used in casual speech among friends,
  family, or in situations where a strong, direct assertion of necessity or obligation is appropriate.
  While it functions similarly to other expressions of obligation, its brevity and directness lend it
  a particular nuance of immediate, often personal, necessity.
false_friends:
  - term: なくてはいけない
    meaning: Must do, have to do
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「なくてはいけない」 is less direct and assertive than 「ないと」. It emphasizes the negative consequence
      of not doing something.
    grammar_point: なくてはいけない (must do)
  - term: なければならない
    meaning: Must do, have to do
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「なければならない」 is a more formal and somewhat stronger expression of obligation than 「なくてはいけない」.
    grammar_point: なければならない (must do)
  - term: なくてはならない
    meaning: Must do, have to do
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「なくてはならない」 is another way to say 「なければならない」, expressing strong necessity. It implies that
      a state or condition cannot be without the action.
    grammar_point: なくてはならない (must do)
  - term: なければいけない
    meaning: Must do, have to do
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「なければいけない」 is a less direct and assertive way of expressing obligation compared to 「ないと」.
      It emphasizes the negative consequence of not doing something.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:なければいけない (must do)
  - term: なくちゃ・なきゃ
    meaning: Must do, have to do
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「なくちゃ」 and 「なきゃ」 are even more casual contractions of 「なければ」, similar in nuance to 「ないと」 but
      even more informal and often used in very relaxed conversation.
    grammar_point: なくちゃ・なきゃ (must do)
  - term: べき
    meaning: Must, should, ought to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「べき」 expresses a moral obligation or what someone should ideally do, often implying a sense
      of duty or appropriateness. In contrast, 「ないと」 simply indicates a necessity or a practical requirement,
      where not fulfilling it would lead to an undesirable outcome.
    grammar_point: べき (should)
  - term: ～する必要がある
    meaning: to need to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This simply states a general necessity or requirement, without the inherent negative consequence
      implied by 「ないと」 if the action is not performed. It is more neutral and often more formal.
    grammar_point: 必要 が ある (it is necessary)
  - term: ～べきだ
    meaning: should do, ought to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～べきだ」 expresses a moral or social obligation, or what is proper or appropriate to do. It
      carries a sense of recommendation or duty, whereas 「ないと」 implies a direct, unavoidable necessity
      due to circumstances or consequences.
    grammar_point: べき (should)
  - term: ～べきではない
    meaning: should not do, ought not to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expresses that an action is inappropriate or not advisable, often based on moral or social
      grounds. It is a prescriptive statement, distinct from 「ないと」, which describes an unavoidable situation.
    grammar_point: べきではない (should not)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share a similar meaning of 'must do' or 'have to do,'
  they differ in formality and nuance. 「ないと」 and its contractions are casual. 「なくてはいけない」 and 「なければいけない」
  are more formal and less direct. 「べき」 carries a sense of moral obligation. It is important to choose
  the expression that is most appropriate for the context and your relationship with the listener.
examples:
  - english: It's already 8, isn't it? We have to leave soon.
    japanese:
      - もう 8 時 だ ね。そろそろ 出発 {し ない と}。
      - もう 8 時 だ ね。そろそろ 出発 {し ない と いけ ない}。
      - もう 8 時 だ ね。そろそろ 出発 {し ない と だめ}。
    english_literally: It's already 8, isn't it. Soon, if we don't depart...
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 8 時 だ ね。そろそろ 出発 し なけれ ば なり ませ ん。
        english: It's already 8, isn't it? We must depart soon.
        hint: This phrase uses a more formal way of expressing obligation. We're looking for a casual
          expression often used among close friends.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 8 時 だ ね。そろそろ 出発 する 時間 だ。
        english: It's already 8, isn't it? It's about time to leave.
        hint: This phrase expresses that it's time to do something, but without the implicit negative
          consequence of not doing it. We're looking for an expression of necessity.
    scene: A friend casually reminding another friend that it's getting late for their planned outing.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of 「もう...だね」 signals a gentle reminder of the time. The truncated 「しないと」 implies a
      shared understanding of the impending necessity to leave, conveying a sense of urgency without being
      overly demanding.
    etymology: The casual contraction of 「しないといけない」 into 「しないと」 emphasizes the speaker's internal thought
      and direct, immediate sense of obligation, rather than a more formal or externally imposed necessity.
      This truncation is common in informal speech where context makes the full meaning clear.
  - english: Tomorrow is the exam. I absolutely have to study tonight.
    japanese:
      - 明日 が 試験 だ。今夜 は 絶対 勉強 {し ない と}。
      - 明日 が 試験 だ。今夜 は 絶対 勉強 {し ない と いけ ない}。
      - 明日 が 試験 だ。今夜 は 絶対 勉強 {し ない と だめ}。
    english_literally: Tomorrow is the exam. Tonight, absolutely, if I don't study...
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 が 試験 だ。今夜 は 絶対 勉強 す べき だ。
        english: Tomorrow is the exam. I absolutely should study tonight.
        hint: This expresses a moral obligation or recommendation, not a personal, urgent necessity with
          implied negative consequences if not done. We're looking for a direct sense of 'have to'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 が 試験 だ。今夜 は 絶対 勉強 する 必要 が ある。
        english: Tomorrow is the exam. I absolutely need to study tonight.
        hint: This states necessity in a more neutral way. We're looking for a casual phrase that implies
          an undesirable outcome if the action isn't taken.
    scene: A student realizing the gravity of an upcoming exam, reflecting to themselves.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「絶対 (zettai)」 adds strong emphasis, indicating an unyielding necessity. The lack of いけない or
      だめ indicates this is a personal, internal resolve or realization, rather than a formal directive.
    etymology: The phrase 「しないと」 (abbreviated from 「しないといけない」) emphasizes the personal and immediate necessity
      felt by the speaker. The omission of the latter part of the phrase (e.g., いけない) is a common feature
      of casual Japanese, conveying a direct and often urgent internal thought process without the formality
      of a complete sentence.
  - english: Since you were wrong, you have to apologize to him.
    japanese:
      - 君 が 間違っ て い た ん だ から、彼 に 謝ら {ない と いけ ない} よ。
      - 君 が 間違っ て い た ん だ から、彼 に 謝ら {ない と} よ。
      - 君 が 間違っ て い た ん だ から、彼 に 謝ら {ない と だめ} だ よ。
    english_literally: Since you were wrong, if you don't apologize to him, it won't go well.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 君 が 間違っ て い た ん だ から、彼 に 謝る べき だ よ。
        english: Since you were wrong, you should apologize to him.
        hint: This expresses a moral obligation or what is proper. We're looking for an expression of
          unavoidable necessity with a clear negative consequence if not performed.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 君 が 間違っ て い た ん だ から、彼 に 謝ら なけれ ば なら ない よ。
        english: Since you were wrong, you must apologize to him.
        hint: This is a more formal and stronger expression of obligation. The original example is more
          casual, suitable for an older brother advising a younger one.
    scene: An elder brother advising his younger brother after a disagreement.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「よ」 at the end adds a sense of assertion and conviction, making it a firm piece
      of advice or instruction. 「間違っていたんだから」 (since you were wrong) clearly states the reason for the
      obligation.
    etymology: The construction 「～ないといけない」 literally means 'if (you) don't (do) it, it's no good/it won't
      go'. This grammatical form emphasizes the negative consequence of not performing the action, thereby
      expressing a strong necessity. The final particle 「よ」 reinforces the speaker's conviction and informs
      the listener of something important.
  - english: I have to finish the report by the end of today. Tomorrow would be fine.
    japanese:
      - 今日 中 に 報告 書 を 仕上げ {ない と いけ ない} ん だ。明日 なら 大丈夫 だ よ。
      - 今日 中 に 報告 書 を 仕上げ {ない と いけ ない} ん です。明日 なら 大丈夫 です よ。
      - 今日 中 に 報告 書 を 仕上げ {し ない と いけ ませ ん}。明日 なら 大丈夫 です よ。
      - 今日 中 に 報告 書 を 仕上げ {ない と だめ} な ん です。明日 なら 大丈夫 です よ。
    english_literally: Within today, if I don't finish the report, it won't go well. If it's tomorrow,
      it's fine.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 中 に 報告 書 を 仕上げ なけれ ば なら ない ん だ。明日 なら 大丈夫 だ よ。
        english: I must finish the report by the end of today. Tomorrow would be fine.
        hint: This is a more formal and direct expression of obligation. The original uses a more explanatory
          and slightly softer tone suitable for apologizing or giving a reason.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 中 に 報告 書 を 仕上げる 必要 が ある ん だ。明日 なら 大丈夫 だ よ。
        english: I need to finish the report by the end of today. Tomorrow would be fine.
        hint: This states a general necessity without the implied negative consequence if the action is
          not performed, which is present in the original example's nuance.
    scene: A busy colleague declining a spontaneous invitation but offering an alternative.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: negotiating
    nuance: The use of 「～んだ」 adds an explanatory nuance, providing a clear reason for the refusal. 「今日中
      (kyōjū)」 (by the end of today) indicates a strict deadline, emphasizing the immediate necessity
      of the task.
    etymology: The explanatory nuance of 「～んだ」 comes from its origin as 「～のだ」. It is used to provide an
      explanation, reason, or background information, making the speaker's statement sound more justified
      or empathetic in this context of declining an invitation due to obligation.
  - english: No matter when, traffic rules must be obeyed.
    japanese:
      - どんな 時 で も、交通 規則 は 守ら {ない と いけ ませ ん}。
      - どんな 時 で も、交通 規則 は 守ら {ない と だめ です}。
    english_literally: No matter when, traffic rules, if they are not obeyed, it won't go well.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - どんな 時 で も、交通 規則 は 守る べき だ。
        english: No matter when, traffic rules should be obeyed.
        hint: This expresses what is morally or socially proper. We're looking for a statement about an
          absolute, unavoidable necessity with implied consequences.
      - competing_japanese:
          - どんな 時 で も、交通 規則 は 守ら なけれ ば なら ない。
        english: No matter when, traffic rules must be obeyed.
        hint: This is a slightly more formal and less direct phrasing of obligation. The original sentence
          is more of a direct statement of necessity.
    scene: A general public safety announcement.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The phrase 「どんな時でも (donna toki demo)」 (at all times, no matter when) highlights the universality
      and constant applicability of the rule. This formal statement emphasizes a non-negotiable societal
      obligation.
    etymology: The particle 「でも」, when combined with interrogative words like 「どんな」, forms phrases like
      「どんな時でも」 (no matter when/what time). The root of 「でも」 is related to 「である」 (to be) and 「も」 (also/even),
      implying 'even if it is that'. This construction signifies universality or inclusiveness, reinforcing
      the absolute nature of the obligation to obey traffic rules.
  - english: If I win the tournament, I have to contact my coach first.
    japanese:
      - 大会 で 優勝 し たら、まず コーチ に 連絡 {し ない と}。
      - 大会 で 優勝 し たら、まず コーチ に 連絡 {し ない と いけ ない}。
      - 大会 で 優勝 し たら、まず コーチ に 連絡 {し ない と だめ}。
    english_literally: If I win the tournament, first, if I don't contact my coach...
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 大会 で 優勝 し たら、まず コーチ に 連絡 す べき だ。
        english: If I win the tournament, I should contact my coach first.
        hint: This expresses a strong recommendation or moral duty. We're looking for a personal, internal
          sense of necessity or obligation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 大会 で 優勝 し たら、まず コーチ に 連絡 する 必要 が ある。
        english: If I win the tournament, I need to contact my coach first.
        hint: This is a more neutral statement of necessity. The original phrase conveys a more immediate,
          personal 'must-do' feeling, especially with the omission of the full phrase.
    scene: A young athlete mentally planning their next steps after an imagined victory.
    register: casual
    setting: optimistic
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「まず (mazu)」 (first) indicates priority, reflecting the speaker's immediate and strong sense
      of obligation towards their coach after a potential victory. The casual tone and contraction show
      an internal, personal commitment.
    etymology: The casual contraction 「しないと」 in an internal monologue, combined with 「まず」, reveals a thought
      process of prioritizing an action that is deemed necessary. The truncation of the phrase reflects
      the speaker's direct engagement with their own thoughts and plans, common in conversational settings.
  - english: You must keep your promise!
    japanese:
      - 約束 は 守ら {ない と いけ ませ ん}！
      - 約束 は 守ら {ない と だめ です}！
    english_literally: As for promises, if they are not kept, it won't go well!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 約束 は 守る べき です！
        english: You should keep your promise!
        hint: This expresses a moral imperative or what is proper, rather than an unavoidable necessity
          with an implied negative consequence if not done. We're looking for a polite but firm command
          emphasizing immediate necessity.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 約束 は 守ら なけれ ば なら ない です！
        english: You must keep your promise!
        hint: This is a more formal and slightly less direct way of expressing obligation. The original
          example uses a common, strong, polite negative form to emphasize the necessity.
    scene: A parent sternly instructing their child about the importance of integrity.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: commanding
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The polite but firm 「いけません」 combined with the exclamation mark conveys a strong, non-negotiable
      command, emphasizing the importance of keeping one's promise as a fundamental principle. The use
      of polite form even to a child indicates gravity.
    etymology: The polite negative form 「いけません」 from 「いけない」 adds a layer of formality and directness to
      the command, making it suitable for a parent instructing a child on a serious matter. The polite
      form can convey respect even in a commanding tone, emphasizing the importance of the message.
  - english: Why do I have to pay tuition fees?
    japanese:
      - な ぜ、授業 料 を 払わ {ない と いけ ない} の です か？
      - な ぜ、授業 料 を 払わ {ない と いけ ませ ん} か？
    english_literally: Why, if I don't pay tuition fees, it won't go well?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - な ぜ、授業 料 を 払う 必要 が ある の です か？
        english: Why do I need to pay tuition fees?
        hint: This expresses a neutral need or requirement. The original phrase implies that not paying
          would lead to negative consequences or is simply not allowed. We're looking for a phrase that
          questions this inevitability.
      - competing_japanese:
          - な ぜ、授業 料 を 払う べき な の です か？
        english: Why should I pay tuition fees?
        hint: This questions the moral or social appropriateness. We're looking for a question about the
          necessity or unavoidable nature of the action.
    scene: A university student questioning the necessity of tuition fees during an orientation.
    register: formal
    setting: interrogative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The formal 「のですか」 expresses a desire for an explanation or justification, indicating a probing
      question about the underlying reason for the obligation rather than a simple inquiry.
    etymology: The question form 「～のですか」 (or 「～んですか」 in casual speech) functions to seek an explanation
      or confirm information. The 「の」 in 「のです」 is a nominalizer, turning the preceding clause into a noun
      phrase, which then functions as the topic of the question. This structure allows the speaker to
      inquire about the circumstances or reason behind a situation, often with a nuance of curiosity or
      even skepticism.
  - english: It's raining today, so we can't go out.
    japanese:
      - 今日 は 雨 だ から、外 に 出かけ {ない だめ} だ よ。
      - 今日 は 雨 だ から、外 に 出かけ {ない と いけ ない} よ。
      - 今日 は 雨 だ から、外 に 出かけ {ない と}。
    english_literally: Today, because it's rain, if we don't go out, it's no good.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 雨 だ から、外 に 出かけ て は いけ ない よ。
        english: It's raining today, so you mustn't go out.
        hint: This expresses a prohibition or something that is not allowed. The original conveys that
          going out is 'no good' or 'impossible' due to circumstances. We're looking for a casual expression
          of impossibility or inadvisability.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 雨 だ から、外 に 出かける の は 無理 だ よ。
        english: It's raining today, so going out is impossible.
        hint: This states that an action is impossible or unreasonable. We're looking for a phrase that
          conveys 'it's no good if you don't (stay in)' or 'it's no good to go out'.
    scene: A mother explaining to her child why they cannot go outside to play.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「だめだよ」 is a very common, casual way for a parent to tell a child something is not allowed
      or possible due to circumstances. 「雨だから」 (because it's raining) provides the simple, direct reason
      for the necessity of staying inside.
    etymology: The expression 「だめだ」 means 'it's no good' or 'it's impossible/forbidden'. It is a more
      colloquial and direct alternative to 「いけない」 when conveying a sense of prohibition or impossibility
      due to circumstances. The use of 「だめだよ」 often softens the prohibition, especially when spoken by
      a parent to a child, making it sound more understanding than a strict command.
  - english: I have to prepare the presentation materials by tomorrow morning.
    japanese:
      - 明日 の 朝 まで に プレゼン 資料 を 準備 {し ない と いけ ない} の です。
      - 明日 の 朝 まで に プレゼン 資料 を 準備 {し ない と いけ ませ ん}。
      - 明日 の 朝 まで に プレゼン 資料 を 準備 {し ない と だめ です}。
    english_literally: By tomorrow morning, if I don't prepare the presentation materials, it won't go
      well.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 の 朝 まで に プレゼン 資料 を 準備 し なけれ ば なら ない の です。
        english: I must prepare the presentation materials by tomorrow morning.
        hint: This is a more formal and direct expression of obligation. The original uses a more explanatory
          and slightly softer tone suitable for apologizing or giving a reason.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 の 朝 まで に プレゼン 資料 を 準備 する 必要 が ある の です。
        english: I need to prepare the presentation materials by tomorrow morning.
        hint: This states a general necessity without the implied negative consequence or the tone of
          unavoidable obligation present in the original example. We're looking for a phrase that implies
          consequences for not fulfilling the obligation.
    scene: A project manager explaining to a friend why they cannot attend a social gathering.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「のです」 adds an explanatory tone, offering a clear reason for their unavailability.
      「明日 の 朝 まで に」 (by tomorrow morning) emphasizes a strict deadline, highlighting the unavoidable nature
      of the task.
    etymology: The 「のです」 ending, a more formal version of 「んだ」 or 「のよ」, is used here to explain a situation
      or reason, lending an air of sincerity and formality. This form often appears when providing justification
      for an action or an inability to act, fitting well with an apologetic context.
  - english: I haven't exercised lately, so I really have to start working out.
    japanese:
      - 最近 運動 し て ない から、本当 に 運動 {し ない と}。
      - 最近 運動 し て ない から、本当 に 運動 {し ない と いけ ない}。
      - 最近 運動 し て ない から、本当 に 運動 {し ない と だめ}。
    english_literally: Recently, because I haven't exercised, truly, if I don't exercise...
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最近 運動 し て ない から、本当 に 運動 す べき だ。
        english: I haven't exercised lately, so I really should start working out.
        hint: This expresses a moral obligation or recommendation, not a personal, urgent necessity with
          implied negative consequences if not done. We're looking for a direct sense of 'have to'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最近 運動 し て ない から、本当 に 運動 する 必要 が ある。
        english: I haven't exercised lately, so I really need to start working out.
        hint: This states necessity in a more neutral way. We're looking for a casual phrase that implies
          an undesirable outcome if the action isn't taken.
    scene: Someone reflecting on their health and fitness goals.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The phrase 「本当に～しないと」 emphasizes an internal, personal necessity or commitment to oneself,
      without external pressure. The missing "いけない" or "だめ" highlights this internalized motivation.
    etymology: The use of 「本当に」 amplifies the personal conviction behind the obligation expressed by 「～しないと」.
      This reflects a common pattern in Japanese where direct emotional or personal commitment is conveyed
      through adverbs combined with abbreviated forms of necessity.
post_example_writeup: Remember that 「ないと」 is a casual contraction. In more formal situations, you'd use
  「ないといけない」. Replacing 「いけない」 with 「だめ」 makes it even more casual, but 「ならない」 is not a good replacement.
