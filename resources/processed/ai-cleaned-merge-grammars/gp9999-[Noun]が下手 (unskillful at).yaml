pronunciation:
  katakana: ヘタ
  romaji: Heta
formation:
  '[Noun] + が + 下手だ': Indicates that someone lacks skill in a particular area or at a particular thing.
jlpt: N4
etymology: 下手 (heta) literally combines 下 (shita, "below" or "lower") and 手 (te, "hand"). This etymology
  suggests an image of having one's hand positioned "lower" or being "less skilled" in a craft or activity,
  leading to its meaning of clumsiness or lack of proficiency. It contrasts directly with 上手 (jouzu, "upper
  hand"), which means skillful.
writeup: 下手 (heta) is a な-adjective used to express that someone is unskillful or poor at a particular
  activity or task. It is often paired with the particle が to mark the area of proficiency. While 下手 can
  be used broadly, it carries a nuance that can be direct or even impolite when used to describe someone
  else's abilities, especially if that person is present. Therefore, it is often used when speaking about
  **one's own lack of skill** in a self-deprecating manner, or when speaking about someone else's skill
  *indirectly* or *impersonally*. For example, saying 「私は絵が下手です。」 (I am bad at drawing.) is very common
  and natural. However, saying 「あなたは歌が下手ですね。」 (You are bad at singing, aren't you?) can sound blunt and
  rude, even if true. This grammar point is straightforward in its meaning but requires careful consideration
  of context and politeness levels, particularly when discussing others' capabilities. For situations
  where a softer expression is preferred, especially when discussing someone else's skill, other phrases
  like `あまり得意じゃない` (amari tokui janai - not very good at) might be more appropriate.
false_friends:
  - term: 上手 (jouzu)
    meaning: skillful at; good at
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 上手 is the direct opposite of 下手. While 下手 can be impolite when describing others, 上手 can sometimes
      feel like praising someone from above (if used by a superior to a subordinate), so お上手ですね (o-jouzu
      desu ne) is often used ironically or as light flattery. For genuine praise, it's safer to use specific
      compliments about the action itself.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Noun]が上手だ (skillful at)
  - term: 苦手 (nigate)
    meaning: not good at; weak point
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 苦手 implies a personal feeling of discomfort or aversion towards something, or simply that
      one is not good at it, often without implying a judgment on one's innate skill. It's a more polite
      and softer way to say "I'm not good at this" or "I don't like this type of thing/person". 下手 is
      more about the objective lack of skill.
    grammar_point: 苦手 (not good at)
  - term: 出来ない (dekinai)
    meaning: cannot do; unable to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 出来ない denotes an inability to perform an action, either due to a lack of physical capability,
      knowledge, or opportunity. It's a binary state (can vs. cannot). 下手 denotes a degree of skill—one
      can do it, but not well. For instance, 「私はピアノが弾けません。」 (I cannot play the piano.) means I literally
      don't know how or am physically unable. 「私はピアノが下手です。」 (I am bad at playing the piano.) means I can
      play, but my performance is poor.
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 下手 (heta) expresses a direct lack of skill, it is important to distinguish
  it from other similar expressions to convey the intended nuance accurately. 上手 (jouzu) is its direct
  opposite, meaning "skillful." However, using 上手 to praise someone, especially a subordinate, can sometimes
  be perceived as condescending, akin to saying "good job, little one." For direct praise to peers or
  superiors, it is often better to use more specific compliments about their achievement or skill. 苦手
  (nigate) is a softer and more polite way to express not being good at something. It often conveys a
  personal dislike or a feeling of being weak in a particular area, rather than a definitive lack of skill.
  For example, 「歌は苦手です。」 (Uta wa nigate desu - Singing is not my strong suit / I'm not good at singing)
  sounds less harsh than 「歌が下手です。」 (Uta ga heta desu - I am bad at singing). 苦手 also extends to situations
  or people one finds difficult to handle. 出来ない (dekinai) means "cannot do" or "unable to do." This indicates
  a complete inability to perform an action, possibly due to lack of knowledge, physical capability, or
  opportunity. 下手 implies that one *can* do the action, but *not well*. Therefore, choosing between 下手
  and 出来ない depends on whether the person performs the action poorly (下手) or cannot perform it at all (出来ない).
