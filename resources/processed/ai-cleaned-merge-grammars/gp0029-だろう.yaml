    "etymology": "「だろう」 is derived from the copula 「だ」, combined with the volitional auxiliary 「う」. Over time, it evolved from expressing intention to expressing conjecture or probability. The polite form is 「でしょう」, stemming from 「です」.",
    "writeup": "「だろう」 is used to express the speaker's conjecture, probability, or uncertain assertion. It implies that the speaker thinks something is likely true but lacks definitive evidence. It's similar to saying \"probably\" or \"isn't it?\" in English. The polite equivalent is 「でしょう」. It can be used after verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. For な-adjectives and nouns, 「だ」 or 「だった」 is often inserted before 「だろう」 to create a grammatically correct sentence, such as 「綺麗だろう」 becoming 「綺麗**だ**ろう」, and 「先生だろう」 becoming 「先生**だ**ろう」. 「だろう」 is generally considered more casual and can have a slightly more masculine nuance compared to 「でしょう」. While often used when the speaker has some information to support their assertion, it can also express a mere 'feeling' or 'hunch,' in which case it conveys low confidence, often indicated by the speaker's tone of voice.",

Lastly, 「です / ですね」 state facts or seek agreement on known facts, and 「そう」 indicates an appearance.",
