    "etymology": "「だろう」 is derived from the copula 「だ」, combined with the volitional auxiliary 「う」. Over time, it evolved from expressing intention to expressing conjecture or probability. The polite form is 「でしょう」, stemming from 「です」.",
    "writeup": "「だろう」 is used to express the speaker's conjecture, probability, or uncertain assertion. It implies that the speaker thinks something is likely true but lacks definitive evidence. It's similar to saying \"probably\" or \"isn't it?\" in English.\n\nIt can be used after verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. For な-adjectives and nouns, 「だ」 or 「だった」 is often inserted directly before 「だろう」 to create a grammatically correct sentence, such as 「綺麗だろう」 (for a present state) or 「綺麗だったろう」 (for a past state).\n\n「だろう」 is generally considered more casual and can have a slightly more masculine nuance compared to 「でしょう」. While often used when the speaker has some information to support their assertion, it can also express a mere 'feeling' or 'hunch,' in which case it conveys low confidence, often indicated by the speaker's tone of voice.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「かもしれない」 expresses a lower degree of certainty compared to 「だろう」. 「かもしれない」 suggests a possibility, while 「だろう」 suggests a probability. It is often used when the speaker is not confident in their conjecture, or when there is only a slim chance of something being true, whereas 「だろう」 implies a higher likelihood or a more general assumption. For example, 「雨 が 降る かもしれない」 (It might rain) suggests a slight chance, while 「雨 が 降る だろう」 (It will probably rain) indicates a stronger likelihood based on current signs like dark clouds. In conversations, 「かもしれない」 often implies the speaker is less certain, while 「だろう」 implies a higher degree of confidence or an expectation that the listener will agree with the conjecture due to shared context or observation, often leading to a question like 'isn't it?' in English. This subtle distinction in certainty and shared assumption is key to differentiating them."

            "nuance": "「はずだ」 indicates a stronger expectation or reason than 「だろう」. 「はずだ」 implies that there's a logical reason for something to be true, often based on concrete evidence or a rule. For example, 「彼 は 来る はずだ」 (He should come/is expected to come) suggests certainty based on a schedule or previous arrangement. In contrast, 「彼 は 来る だろう」 (He will probably come) is more of a general conjecture without necessarily strong backing. 「はずだ」 conveys objective certainty (or high probability), while 「だろう」 is subjective conjecture. 「はずだ」 is often used when the speaker is confident in their deduction due to logical reasons or established facts, while 「だろう」 is used when the speaker is making a general assumption, often based on less concrete evidence, or seeking agreement without asserting a strong conviction. The nuance of 「はずだ」 is one of strong expectation or logical conclusion, whereas 「だろう」 is more about prediction or seeking affirmation."

            "nuance": "「そうだ」 (hearsay) conveys information heard from someone else, whereas 「だろう」 indicates the speaker's own conjecture. For example, 「雨 が 降る そうだ」 (I heard it will rain) reports information from a source, while 「雨 が 降る だろう」 (It will probably rain) is the speaker's own prediction. 「そうだ」 (appearance) expresses an impression based on visual information, unlike 「だろう」 which is about likelihood. For example, 「おいし そうだ」 (It looks delicious) is based on appearance, whereas 「おいしい だろう」 (It's probably delicious) is a conjecture about taste. The key difference is that 「そうだ」 refers to information from an external source or direct sensory perception, while 「だろう」 is the speaker's internal assessment of probability."

            "nuance": "Unlike 「だろう」, 「じゃないか」 implies a stronger assertion, often used when the speaker is confirming something they believe to be true or expressing slight surprise, expecting agreement. For example, 「これ は いい じゃないか」 (This is good, isn't it? / This is good!) implies a stronger conviction or a slight discovery. 「じゃないか」 often carries a nuance of mild rhetorical question or confirmation of something obvious, sometimes with a slight reproach or emphasis. 「だろう」 is generally softer, expressing a more tentative probability or seeking agreement without strong assertion. While both can seek agreement, 「じゃないか」 has a more assertive, almost accusatory or exclamatory tone, whereas 「だろう」 is more purely conjectural or gently seeking consensus."

For example, 「寒い です ね」 (It's cold, isn't it?) assumes both parties are experiencing the cold. 「ね」 confirms shared information or feelings, fostering empathy. In contrast, 「寒い だろう」 (It's probably cold) is a prediction or assumption. 「ね」 functions to ensure shared understanding and confirm existing facts or perceptions, while 「だろう」 introduces new information in the form of a conjecture or seeks agreement on something that is not yet a shared certainty. Therefore, 「ね」 is more about mutual affirmation, whereas 「だろう」 is about expressing and inviting agreement on a probability."

For example, 「これ は 良い のではないだろうか」 (Don't you think this might be good?) is a polite and indirect way to suggest an idea. It adds a layer of politeness and tentativeness, making the speaker's opinion sound less direct and more open to consideration. It is often used in academic or business settings to propose an idea without sounding overly assertive, inviting constructive feedback. While 「だろう」 is a direct conjecture, 「のではないだろうか」 is a nuanced way to present a hypothesis or opinion, seeking polite agreement or discussion."

            "nuance": "「と思う」 expresses the speaker's personal opinion or belief, which can be based on evidence or simply a feeling. It's a direct statement of one's thoughts, regardless of whether the listener agrees. For example, 「美味しい と 思う」 (I think it's delicious) is a personal judgment. Unlike 「だろう」, which conjectures about a general probability or seeks agreement, 「と 思う」 is subjective and states what the speaker believes to be true. While 「だろう」 implies a degree of shared understanding or expectation of agreement from the listener, 「と 思う」 is solely focused on the speaker's internal thought process. 「と 思う」 is about personal conviction, while 「だろう」 is about shared probability or seeking consensus."

For instance, 「これ は リンゴ です」 (This is an apple) is a factual statement. 「これ は リンゴ です ね」 (This is an apple, isn't it?) seeks confirmation on a known fact. In contrast, 「これ は リンゴ だろう」 (This is probably an apple) expresses uncertainty or conjecture. The key distinction is that 「です」 and 「です ね」 deal with established facts or shared understandings, while 「だろう」 deals with probabilities and assumptions. Therefore, 「です / です ね」 are about conveying or confirming reality, whereas 「だろう」 is about predicting or assuming reality."

For example, 「彼 は 来る らしい」 (It seems he will come) implies information was obtained from someone else or deduced from circumstances. 「らしい」 suggests indirect evidence. In contrast, 「だろう」 is the speaker's own conjecture or probability, often without necessarily explicit external evidence, and can be more of a personal hunch. While both convey a degree of uncertainty, 「らしい」 points to an external basis for the inference, whereas 「だろう」 highlights the speaker's internal assessment of likelihood."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusing 「だろう」 with similar expressions, remember that 「だろう」 indicates the speaker's conjecture or probability. 「でしょう」 is its polite form. 「かもしれない」 expresses a lower possibility. 「はずだ」 implies a stronger expectation based on logic. 「そうだ」 relays information heard from others or describes an appearance, whereas 「らしい」 conveys information based on external cues or hearsay. 「じゃないか」 makes a stronger, often confirmatory assertion. 「ね」 softens a statement or invites agreement on a known fact. 「と 思う」 expresses a personal opinion. Lastly, 「です / です ね」 state facts or seek agreement on known facts.
