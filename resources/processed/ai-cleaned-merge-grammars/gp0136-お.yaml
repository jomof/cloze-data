    "etymology": "The prefix 「お」 is derived from the verb 「置く」 (oku), meaning \"to place\" or \"to put.\" The idea is that by adding 「お」, you are metaphorically \"placing\" respect onto the word, thereby elevating its status and showing deference to the listener or the subject of the sentence.",
    "writeup": "The polite prefix 「お」 is used extensively in Japanese to express respect, modesty, or politeness. It can be attached to nouns, adjectives, and verbs (in their ます stem form). Using 「お」 appropriately is **crucial** for maintaining proper social etiquette in Japan. Generally, 「お」 is added to words related to the listener or a third party you wish to show respect to, but not to things directly related to the speaker in humble speech. There are some words that always take 「お」, regardless of the context, such as 「お金」 (okane, money).",
