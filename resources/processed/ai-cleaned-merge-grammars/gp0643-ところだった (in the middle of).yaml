    "etymology": "「ところ」 (tokoro) means 'place' or 'situation'. 「だった」 (datta) is the past tense of the copula 「だ」 (da), indicating a state that existed in the past. Thus, 「ところだった」 implies 'was in the situation of' or 'was about to be in the state of'. It conveys a sense of near-miss or interrupted action.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ところだった」 (tokoro datta) is used to express that someone was just about to do something, or was in the middle of doing something, when an unexpected event occurred, preventing the action from being completed.  It conveys a sense of 'almost' or 'nearly'. It is often used to express relief that something didn't happen (especially something bad), or regret that something didn't happen. The verb preceding 「ところだった」 is always in the dictionary form. The nuance often implies that the speaker barely avoided a certain outcome. Often, 「危うく」 appears at the beginning of the sentence to add emphasis to the danger that was avoided.",
