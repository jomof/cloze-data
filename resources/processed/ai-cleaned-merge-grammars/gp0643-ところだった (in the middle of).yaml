        "nuance": "Often implies a narrow miss, a near-disaster, or a missed opportunity. Can convey relief (if a bad outcome was avoided) or regret (if a good outcome was missed).",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a predicate to describe a state of being on the verge of an action."
    },
    "etymology": "「ところ」 (tokoro) means 'place' or 'situation'. 「だった」 (datta) is the past tense of the copula 「だ」 (da), indicating a state that existed in the past. Thus, 「ところだった」 implies 'was in the situation of' or 'was about to be in the state of'. It conveys a sense of near-miss or interrupted action.",
    "writeup": "「ところだった」 is a versatile grammatical expression indicating that an action or event was on the verge of happening but ultimately did not occur, or was interrupted. It conveys a strong sense of a 'near miss' or an 'almost' situation. The phrase is typically appended to the dictionary form of a verb (Vる). \n\nThis pattern emphasizes that the speaker (or subject) was at the precise 'point' or 'juncture' (ところ) of performing an action, and then something intervened. The resulting implication can vary: \n\n*   **Relief**: When a negative outcome was narrowly avoided. For instance, if you almost had an accident but managed to prevent it. In such cases, adverbs like 「危うく」 (ayauku - barely, narrowly, almost) are often used to emphasize the close call.\n*   **Regret or Disappointment**: When a desired outcome was just about to materialize but was thwarted. For example, if you were just about to receive good news, but something prevented it. When this regret is strong, it is common to see 「のに」 (noni) appended after 「ところだった」, expressing 'even though I was just about to do X, Y happened (which is regrettable/contrary to expectation)'.\n\nWhile 「ところだった」 itself is a plain form, its usage is common across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal settings, depending on the surrounding sentence structure and politeness markers (e.g., adding 「です」).",

The key difference is that with 「ところだ」, the action is either impending, ongoing, or completed, whereas with 「ところだった」, the action did *not* complete."
