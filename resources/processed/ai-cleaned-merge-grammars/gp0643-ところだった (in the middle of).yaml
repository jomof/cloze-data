    },
    "etymology": "「ところ」 (tokoro) means 'place' or 'situation'. 「だった」 (datta) is the past tense of the copula 「だ」 (da), indicating a state that existed in the past. Thus, 「ところだった」 implies 'was in the situation of' or 'was about to be in the state of'. It conveys a sense of near-miss or interrupted action.",
    "writeup": "「ところだった」 is a versatile grammatical expression indicating that an action or event was on the verge of happening but ultimately did not occur, or was interrupted. It conveys a strong sense of a 'near miss' or an 'almost' situation. The phrase is typically appended to the dictionary form of a verb (Vる).\n\nThis pattern emphasizes that the speaker (or subject) was at the precise 'point' or 'juncture' (ところ) of performing an action, and then something intervened. The resulting implication can vary:\n\n*   **Relief**: When a negative outcome was narrowly avoided. For instance, if you almost had an accident but managed to prevent it. In such cases, adverbs like 「危うく」 (ayauku - barely, narrowly, almost) are often used to emphasize the close call.\n*   **Regret or Disappointment**: When a desired outcome was just about to materialize but was thwarted. For example, if you were just about to receive good news, but something prevented it. When this regret is strong, it is common to see 「のに」 (noni) appended after 「ところだった」, expressing 'even though I was just about to do X, Y happened (which is regrettable/contrary to expectation)'.\n\nWhile 「ところだった」 itself is a plain form, its usage is common across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal settings, depending on the surrounding sentence structure and politeness markers (e.g., adding 「です」).",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ところだった」 vividly captures the essence of a narrow escape or a missed opportunity—an action that was on the brink of happening but didn't—it is crucial to distinguish it from similar expressions. 「ところだ」 describes something currently impending or just completed, directly contrasting the unfulfilled nature of 「ところだった」. Similarly, 「～ようとする」 indicates an an attempt or intention, focusing on the actor's will, whereas 「ところだった」 emphasizes the external circumstances that prevented completion. Lastly, 「～そうになる」 highlights the appearance or likelihood of an action being carried out, often used for physically observable near-misses, while 「ところだった」 can apply more broadly to situations and mental states of being on the verge.
