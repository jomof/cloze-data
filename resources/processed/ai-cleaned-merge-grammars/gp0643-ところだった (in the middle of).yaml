    "etymology": "「ところ」 means 'place' or 'situation,' and 「だった」 is the past tense of 「だ (desu)」. The combination implies 'was in the situation of doing something.'",
    "writeup": "When combined with the dictionary form of verbs, 「ところだった」 indicates that something was just about to happen or was in the middle of happening. It often implies that something *almost* happened but didn't. A common translation is \"was just about to do (A)\" or \"was in the middle of (A).\" It often indicates a positive or negative result that arose from *not* doing (A).",
