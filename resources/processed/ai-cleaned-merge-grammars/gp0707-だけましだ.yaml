    "etymology": "The grammar point 「だけましだ」 is derived from 「だけ」 (only, just) and 「まし」, which comes from the conjunctive form of the verb 「増す」 (masu), meaning \"to increase\" or \"to be better\". So, literally, it suggests that 'even just this much is an improvement'. 「まし」 can be written in hiragana or katakana (マシ), with the katakana form often emphasizing the feeling of gratitude.",
    "writeup": "「だけましだ」 is a set phrase indicating that \"at least (A)\", or that \"one should feel grateful for (A)\". This expression is often used in situations where the overall situation is negative, but it is still better than the alternative. This structure combines the particle 「だけ」 (only) and the *na*-adjective 「増し」, meaning \"better\" or \"preferable\". Originally, 「まし」 is simply the conjunctive form of 「増す」, a *u*-verb meaning to grow or increase. Due to this, the literal meaning is \"even just (A) is a plus, compared to what could have occurred\". 「だけましだ」 will be used primarily after verbs, *i*-adjectives, or *na*-adjectives followed by 「な」.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, 「まし」 will simply be written in hiragana, or even katakana as 「マシ」. The katakana version often further emphasizes that one should be grateful for (A).\n\n**重要事項：**\n\nAlthough less common, you may also see 「だけまだましだ」. The addition of 「まだ」 (still) merely emphasizes the point even further.",
