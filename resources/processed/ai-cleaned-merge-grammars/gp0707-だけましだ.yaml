    "etymology": "The grammar point 「だけましだ」 is derived from 「だけ」 (only, just) and 「まし」, which comes from the conjunctive form of the verb 「増す」 (masu), meaning \"to increase\" or \"to be better\". So, literally, it suggests that 'even just this much is an improvement'. 「まし」 can be written in hiragana or katakana (マシ), with the katakana form often emphasizing the feeling of gratitude.",
    "writeup": "「だけましだ」 is a set phrase indicating that \"at least (A)\", or that \"one should feel grateful for (A)\". This expression is often used in situations where the overall situation is negative, but it is still better than the alternative. This structure combines the particle 「だけ」 (only) and the *na*-adjective 「増し」, meaning \"better\" or \"preferable\". Originally, 「まし」 is simply the conjunctive form of 「増す」, a *u*-verb meaning to grow or increase. Due to this, the literal meaning is \"even just (A) is a plus, compared to what could have occurred\". 「だけましだ」 will be used primarily after verbs, *i*-adjectives, or *na*-adjectives followed by 「な」.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, 「まし」 will simply be written in hiragana, or even katakana as 「マシ」. The katakana version often further emphasizes that one should be grateful for (A).\n\n**重要事項：**\n\nAlthough less common, you may also see 「だけまだましだ」. The addition of 「まだ」 (still) merely emphasizes the point even further.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While `〜よりマシ` directly compares two things and states one is better, `だけましだ` implies a broader context where the situation itself might be bad, but a specific aspect is still a silver lining, suggesting gratitude or resignation."

            "kind": "antonym",
            "nuance": " `〜に過ぎない` downplays the significance of something, suggesting it's minimal or insufficient, whereas `だけましだ` suggests even a minimal positive aspect is valuable given the circumstances."

            "nuance": "`〜とはいえ` acknowledges a fact or condition while introducing a contrasting or surprising statement, similar to `だけましだ` in setting up a less-than-ideal situation. However, `だけましだ` explicitly expresses a sense of being better off or grateful for something."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While `だけましだ` focuses on finding a silver lining and expressing a sense of gratitude or relief in an otherwise difficult situation, `〜よりマシ` is a more direct comparison of superiority. `〜に過ぎない` serves the opposite purpose by emphasizing the insignificance of something. `〜とはいえ` can introduce a contrasting statement, similar to how `だけましだ` might be used after acknowledging a negative, but `だけましだ` specifically carries the nuance of finding something to be grateful for.",
