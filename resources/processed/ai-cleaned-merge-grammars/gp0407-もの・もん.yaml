    },
    "etymology": "「もの」 literally means \"thing\". When used at the end of a sentence, it adds a nuance of explanation or reason, as if saying \"だって〜なんだ**もの**！(but it's because ~ thing!)\". 「もん」 is a shortened, more emphatic version of 「もの」.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「もの」 is a sentence-ending particle that literally means 'a thing' but is used to add a soft, explanatory tone to a statement, often translated as \"because\" or \"since\". It implies a reason or justification for the statement, often tinged with personal feeling or a gentle assertion. 「もの」 is considered casual and less formal than 「から」 or 「ので」. When shortened to 「もん」, it becomes even more casual and can sound childish or cute. Therefore, use 「もん」 with caution, especially in professional or formal settings. To emphasize the reason further, the explanatory auxiliary 「んだ」 (after verbs or い-adjectives) or 「なんだ」 (after な-adjectives or nouns) is often used, forming 「〜んだもの」 or 「〜なんですもの」. Note that 「んですもの」 is a slightly more polite version of 「んだもの」, frequently found in media such as anime, manga, and novels, though less common in standard everyday speech.",
