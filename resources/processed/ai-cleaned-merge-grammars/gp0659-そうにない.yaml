    "etymology": "The grammar point 「そうにない」 is derived from 「そう」, which indicates appearance or seeming, combined with 「に」 and 「ない」. 「そう」 implies a certain state or condition is perceived, 「に」 acts as a particle, and 「ない」 negates the perceived state. Thus, 「そうにない」 literally means 'does not have the appearance of' or 'shows no signs of'.",
    "writeup": "「そうにない」 indicates that something is unlikely to happen or shows no signs of happening. Compared to 「そうもない」, which expresses a stronger sense of unlikelihood, 「そうにない」 is less emphatic. It can also mean that something is showing \"no signs of\" something happening. It connects to the ます-stem of a verb.\n\n「そうにもない」 is also used, and has the strongest nuance of being unlikely to happen among 「そうにない」, 「そうもない」, and 「そうにもない」. The difference lies in the presence or absence of the particles 「に」 and 「も」.\n\nAs 「そうにない」 is an extension of the auxiliary verb 「そう」 (used for speculation or hearsay), it indicates that something does not appear likely to occur.",
