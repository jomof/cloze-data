    "etymology": "The grammar point 「そうにない」 is derived from 「そう」, which expresses a conjecture based on appearance. Adding 「にない」 negates that appearance, indicating the unlikelihood of something happening or the absence of any indication that it will.",
    "writeup": "「そうにない」 indicates that something is unlikely to happen or shows no signs of occurring. It's similar to 「そうもない」 but less emphatic. You connect 「そうにない」 to the ます-stem of a verb. For example, 「できそうにない」 means \"unlikely to be able to do.\" 「そうにもない」 is also used, which expresses an even stronger nuance of unlikelihood.",
