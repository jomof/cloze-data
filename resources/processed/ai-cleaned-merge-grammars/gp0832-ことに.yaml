    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことに」 is derived from the noun 「事 (koto)」 meaning 'thing' or 'matter,' combined with the particle 「に (ni)」. The combination emphasizes the degree or extent of something, typically related to a feeling or emotion. In essence, it highlights the *matter* or *thing* that evokes a particular feeling.",
    "writeup": "「ことに」 is used to express a strong feeling or subjective judgment about a situation. It's often translated as \"especially,\" \"particularly,\" or \"to my [feeling].\" It emphasizes the extent to which something evokes a particular emotion.\n\nIt typically follows verbs, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives. For example, 「嬉しいことに」 (ureshii koto ni) means \"I am especially happy that...\"\n\n「幸いなことに」 (saiwai na koto ni) is a common set phrase that means \"fortunately\" or \"luckily.\" This phrase itself uses the 「ことに」 structure.\n\nIn some cases, 「ことに」 may appear before the description it modifies, functioning similarly to 「特に」 (tokuni) to mean \"particularly\" or \"especially\".",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「ことに」, 「そうにない」 expresses a lack of probability or indication, not a feeling or subjective judgment."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "While 「てしょうがない」 also indicates a strong feeling or degree, it implies an uncontrollable or unbearable state, unlike 「ことに」 which simply expresses the emotion or judgment without necessarily implying uncontrollability."

        {
            "term": "てたまらない",
            "meaning": "Can't help but want to, Very, Extremely",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「てたまらない」 expresses an overwhelming, often uncontrollable, urge or feeling, implying that one 'cannot bear' the intensity. 「ことに」 is a more general expression of emotion or judgment, less focused on an unbearable state."

            "nuance": "「てならない」 also indicates a strong, often natural or spontaneous, feeling that one 'can't help but feel'. While similar to 「ことに」 in expressing intensity, 「ことに」 focuses on the subjective judgment or observation about a situation rather than an internal, uncontrollable urge."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「ことに」 always expresses an emotion or subjective judgment related to a situation. When you want to simply state a fact or describe something without expressing a personal feeling or strong subjective judgment, avoid using 「ことに」. Instead, use adverbs like 「特に (tokuni)」 or 「非常に (hijouni)」 for emphasis, or other grammar points that don't carry emotional connotations. It is important to recognize that the meaning warning restricts 「ことに」 to only refer to feelings.",
