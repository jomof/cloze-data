    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことに」 is derived from the noun 「事 (koto)」 meaning 'thing' or 'matter,' combined with the particle 「に (ni)」. The combination emphasizes the degree or extent of something, typically related to a feeling or emotion. In essence, it highlights the *matter* or *thing* that evokes a particular feeling.",
    "writeup": "「ことに」 is used to express a strong feeling or subjective judgment about a situation. It's often translated as \"especially,\" \"particularly,\" or \"to my [feeling].\" It emphasizes the extent to which something evokes a particular emotion.\n\nIt typically follows verbs, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives. For example, 「嬉しいことに」 (ureshii koto ni) means \"I am especially happy that...\"\n\n「幸いなことに」 (saiwai na koto ni) is a common set phrase that means \"fortunately\" or \"luckily.\" This phrase itself uses the 「ことに」 structure.\n\nIn some cases, 「ことに」 may appear before the description it modifies, functioning similarly to 「特に」 (tokuni) to mean \"particularly\" or \"especially\".",

                    "competing_grammar": "今日 は 晴れて 嬉しい です。",
                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes the *feeling* itself being the primary point of observation, which aligns with 「ことに」 rather than just a descriptive statement of personal happiness."

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "optimistic",
            "nuance": "The use of 「嬉しいことに」 highlights that the good weather is a source of joy or relief for the speaker, emphasizing the subjective emotional impact rather than merely stating a fact."

            "nuance": "The phrase 「残念なことに」 allows the speaker to express regret in a formal and somewhat detached manner, conveying that the situation itself is regrettable, rather than solely focusing on their personal sadness. This makes it appropriate for a coach addressing a team."

It conveys 'the troubling thing is that...' rather than 'I am troubled because...'. The past tense of the verb 「困る」 (to be troubled/bothered) connects the feeling directly to the finished action."

When you want to simply state a fact or describe something without expressing a personal feeling or strong subjective judgment, avoid using 「ことに」. Instead, use adverbs like 「特に (tokuni)」 or 「非常に (hijouni)」 for emphasis, or other grammar points that don't carry emotional connotations. It is important to recognize that the meaning warning restricts 「ことに」 to only refer to feelings.",
