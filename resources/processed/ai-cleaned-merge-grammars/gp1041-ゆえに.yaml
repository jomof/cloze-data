    "etymology": "The word 「故(ゆえ)」 itself means \"reason, cause, circumstances.\" The 「に」 is a case-marking particle, in this instance indicating the reason or cause.",
    "writeup": "「ゆえに」 is a formal expression used to indicate a reason or cause, similar to \"because of,\" \"due to,\" or \"therefore.\" It is more common in formal writing and speech. When 「故」 is followed by the case-marking particle 「に」, it highlights the reason. If 「ゆえ」 directly follows another noun, it should be preceded by 「の」. 「ゆえに」 can also appear at the beginning of a new sentence, expressing \"as a result of\" the previous sentence. Note that 「ゆえに」, like \"as a consequence of\" in English, is often used in relation to negative reasons or outcomes.",
