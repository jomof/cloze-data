        "[Noun (の)/Adjective な-stem (な)] + ゆえに": "Indicates a reason or cause, similar to 'because of' or 'due to'.",

    },
    "etymology": "The term 「ゆえ」 itself is an older word meaning \"reason\" or \"cause.\" The addition of 「に」 turns it into an adverbial phrase, emphasizing the reason or cause in a formal manner. It is similar in construction to other phrases like 「ために」 (for the sake of) and 「によって」 (due to).",
    "writeup": "「ゆえに」 is a formal expression used to indicate a reason, cause, or consequence. It translates to \"because,\" \"the reason is,\" \"due to,\" \"therefore,\" or \"so.\" Derived from the noun 「故」 (yui/yue), meaning \"reason\" or \"consequence,\" it is primarily used in formal writing and speech, giving it a stiff, or 「硬い」, impression. It often emphasizes a fundamental or profound reason.\n\n*   When attaching to nouns, the preceding noun takes 「の」 (e.g., 「若さ**ゆえに**」 \"due to youth\"). For verbs and adjectives, 「ゆえに」 generally attaches to their standard (plain) forms.\n*   When used at the beginning of a new sentence, 「ゆえに」 refers to the entire preceding sentence as its reason or cause, functioning like \"therefore\" or \"as a result.\"\n*   Similar to the English \"as a consequence of,\" 「ゆえに」 tends to be used more frequently in contexts involving negative reasons or outcomes rather than positive ones.",
