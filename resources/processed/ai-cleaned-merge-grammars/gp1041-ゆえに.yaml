    "etymology": "The term 「ゆえ」 itself is an older word meaning \"reason\" or \"cause.\" The addition of 「に」 turns it into an adverbial phrase, emphasizing the reason or cause in a formal manner. It is similar in construction to other phrases like 「ために」 (for the sake of) and 「によって」 (due to).",
    "writeup": "「ゆえに」 is a formal expression used to indicate a reason, cause, or consequence. It can be translated as \"because,\" \"the reason is,\" \"due to,\" \"therefore,\" or \"so.\" It is primarily used in formal writing and speech. It is considered a 「硬い」 expression, meaning it is stiff or formal. It's like saying \"as a consequence of\" in English.\n\n*   When connecting to a noun directly, you must use 「の」 before 「ゆえに」 (e.g., 「若さゆえに」 \"due to youth\").\n*   When used at the beginning of a sentence, it refers to the entire previous sentence as the reason or cause.",
