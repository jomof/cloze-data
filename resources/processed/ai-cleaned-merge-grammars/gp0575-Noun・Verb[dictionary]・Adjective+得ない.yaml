        "usage-context": "Often used in formal or literary contexts to express a strong, objective impossibility. Less common in casual speech, except for fixed expressions like `あり得ない`.",
        "function": "Expresses an inherent or fundamental impossibility, often based on logic, nature, or accepted principles.",
        "nuance": "Conveys a stronger sense of impossibility than `できない`. It suggests 'there is no possibility whatsoever that X can be done' or 'the potential to do X cannot be realized'."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「得ない」 is derived from the verb 「得る (eru)」, which means \"to obtain, acquire, or gain.\" When 「得る」 is combined with 「ない」, it creates a negative connotation, indicating the lack of ability or possibility to obtain or achieve something. Historically, 「得る」 often combined with the conjunctive (ます stem) form of other verbs to indicate possibility, a usage rooted in its meaning of 'to be able to get/obtain the result of an action'. The negative 「得ない」 thus means 'unable to get the result', or 'it is impossible'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「得ない (enai)」 is a formal and often literary expression used to indicate impossibility or inability. It is typically attached to the **ます stem** (conjunctive form) of a verb. For instance, `混ざる (mazaru)` becomes `混ざり得ない (mazari-enai)`, and `存在する (sonzai suru)` becomes `存在し得ない (sonzai-shi-enai)`. While the primary attachment is to verbs, its usage in expressions like `あり得ない` (`ある` is a verb) can make it appear to directly follow nouns or adjectives when they are connected via `である` (e.g., `Aであることはあり得ない`), though this is still a verb attachment.\n\nCompared to `できない (dekinai)`, which simply means 'cannot' or 'is unable to' and refers to a lack of ability or potential, 「得ない」 conveys a stronger sense of impossibility. It suggests that 'there is no possibility whatsoever for (A) to occur,' or 'the potential to do (A) has not been, or cannot be, realized.' For example, `そんなことはできない` might imply a personal inability, whereas `そんなことはあり得ない` asserts a fundamental impossibility of the situation.\n\nIt's important to note the different readings of `得る`. While `得る` can be read as either `える (eru)` or `うる (uru)`, only `える` is used in the negative form with `ない`. The reading `うる` is an older, more literary form, rarely used in spoken Japanese, and it never combines with `ない` to form a negative expression.\n\nDespite its formal or bookish nature, some set phrases utilizing 「得ない」 are quite common in daily conversation, such as `あり得る (ari-eru)` meaning \"possible,\" and `あり得ない (ari-enai)` meaning \"impossible\" or \"unbelievable.\" These fixed expressions are often used to convey strong belief or disbelief, even in casual contexts.",
