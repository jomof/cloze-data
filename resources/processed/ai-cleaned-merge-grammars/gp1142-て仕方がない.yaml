        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Used to express an uncontrollable feeling, desire, or sensation, often indicating a strong emotional or physical state that one cannot suppress.",

    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「て仕方がない」 is derived from the te-form of a verb or adjective followed by 「仕方がない」 (shikata ga nai), which literally means \"there is no way to do.\" When combined, it conveys the sense that there is no way to stop or control a particular feeling or sensation.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「て仕方がない」 is used to convey an intense, uncontrollable feeling, desire, or sensation. It implies that the speaker is so overwhelmed by an emotion or physical state that they cannot suppress it. This expression can be used for both positive and negative feelings, indicating that the intensity is beyond the speaker's voluntary control.\n\nThis construction is versatile and can attach to:\n*   The te-form of a verb (e.g., 眠くて仕方がない - I can't help but be sleepy).\n*   The く-form of an い-adjective (e.g., 嬉しくて仕方がない - I can't help but be happy).\n*   The で-form of a な-adjective (e.g., 退屈で仕方がない - I can't help but be bored).\n\nWhile the plain form 「て仕方がない」 is common in casual speech, the polite form 「て仕方ありません」 is used in more formal or polite contexts. The core nuance, however, remains the same: an overwhelming and uncontrollable emotional or physical experience.",
