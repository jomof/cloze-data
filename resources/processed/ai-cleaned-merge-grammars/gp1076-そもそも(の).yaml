    "writeup": "「そもそも」 is an adverb used to express the idea of \"in the first place,\" \"to begin with,\" or \"fundamentally.\" It's used to introduce a basic point or question the underlying assumptions of a situation. It's like saying, \"Let's go back to the beginning here.\" When used as 「そもそもの」, it acts as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞), modifying a noun to indicate its origin or fundamental nature, such as 「そもそもの原因」 (the original cause). This expression is often found in formal or argumentative contexts where clarifying the basics is essential.",
