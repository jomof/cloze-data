    "etymology": "The term 「そもそも」 is derived from 「其の物」 (sono mono), literally meaning \"that thing itself.\" Over time, it evolved to emphasize the fundamental nature or origin of something.",
    "writeup": "「そもそも」 is a powerful adverb used to return to the fundamental aspect or origin of a situation or statement. It conveys the sense of \"in the first place,\" \"to begin with,\" or \"fundamentally.\" When used, it often signals the speaker's intent to question the very basis of an argument, an event, or a concept. This usage is common in discussions, debates, or when clarifying a complex issue by tracing it back to its core.\n\nThe form 「そもそもの」 functions as a pre-noun adjectival, directly modifying a noun to emphasize its original or foundational nature. For instance, 「そもそもの原因」 (the original cause) highlights the root of a problem, suggesting that the initial condition or decision was the source. This distinction is crucial: 「そもそも」 (as an adverb) leads a clause or sentence, challenging or introducing a foundational point, while 「そもそもの」 (as an adjectival) directly qualifies a noun, pinpointing its primary or earliest state.\n\nThis grammar point is frequently encountered in formal or argumentative discourse, academic writing, and situations where a speaker wishes to cut through superficialities and address the absolute core of a matter. It is a mature expression that demands clarity and precision, reflecting a speaker's desire to get to the bottom of things.",
