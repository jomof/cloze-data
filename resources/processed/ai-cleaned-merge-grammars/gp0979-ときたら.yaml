    "etymology": "The expression 「ときたら」 is derived from 「と」 (a case-marking particle) + 「きたら」 (the conditional form of the verb 「来る (くる)」 meaning \"to come\"). Literally, it translates to \"when it comes to...\" or \"if it comes to...\".",
    "writeup": "「ときたら」 is a casual expression used to express mild frustration or to highlight something expected or natural about a topic. It combines the particle 「と」 with 「来たら」, the conditional form of 「来る」. It often translates to \"that blasted (A)\" or \"that darn (A)\", though its literal meaning is simply \"when it comes to (A)\". 「ときたら」 directly follows nouns and is typically written in kana. It's important to understand the context to determine if it's expressing frustration or simply highlighting a characteristic. For instance, it can refer to a commonly known trait or an expected outcome concerning the mentioned topic.",
