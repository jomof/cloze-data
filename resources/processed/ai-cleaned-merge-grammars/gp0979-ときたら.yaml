    "etymology": "The expression 「ときたら」 is derived from 「と」 (a case-marking particle meaning \"as for\" or \"with regards to\") + 「きたら」 (the conditional form of the verb 「来る (くる)」 meaning \"to come\"). Literally, it translates to \"when it comes to...\" or \"if it comes to...\". This etymology highlights its function as a topic marker that sets the stage for a subsequent comment about the subject.",
    "writeup": "「ときたら」 is a versatile casual expression in Japanese used to introduce a topic about which the speaker wishes to express a strong opinion. It typically follows a noun, setting the stage for a comment that is often a complaint, mild frustration, or an observation highlighting something expected or natural about that noun.While it can be translated as \"that blasted (A)\" or \"that darn (A)\" when expressing annoyance, its literal meaning remains \"when it comes to (A).\" This allows for its dual nuance:  **Expressing Frustration/Complaint:** This is the most common usage, where 「ときたら」 precedes a topic about which the speaker is annoyed or exasperated. The following clause will detail the problematic behavior or characteristic.  **Highlighting an Expected/Natural Characteristic:** Less commonly, 「ときたら」 can be used to introduce a topic whose subsequent action or quality is widely known, obvious, or simply what one would naturally expect. In this context, it doesn't carry a negative connotation but rather emphasizes a quintessential aspect or typical outcome.Determining the specific nuance (frustration vs. expectation) relies heavily on the context and the content of the second half of the sentence. Despite these seemingly opposite nuances, both usages function to set up the topic (A) for an emphatic statement (B) about its inherent qualities or behaviors. This grammatical pattern is almost exclusively written in kana, emphasizing its colloquial and informal nature.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ときたら」, 「は」, 「～といえば」, and 「～のこととなると」 all function to introduce a topic, their nuances differ significantly. 「は」 is a neutral topic marker, simply indicating what the sentence is about. 「～といえば」 is used to shift the topic to something related or to confirm a known fact about a topic. 「～のこととなると」 emphasizes a specific area of focus or expertise, often implying a change in behavior when that topic is addressed. In contrast, 「ときたら」 carries a stronger emotional tone, either expressing frustration or highlighting a widely known, inherent characteristic of the topic, making the speaker's stance much clearer and more emphatic.",
