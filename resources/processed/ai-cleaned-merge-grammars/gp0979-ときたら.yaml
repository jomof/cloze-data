    "writeup": "「ときたら」is a casual expression used to express mild frustration towards something (A) in a lighthearted manner. It combines the case-marking particle 「と」, the verb 「来る (kuru)」(to come), and the conditional 「たら (tara)」 'if' 来たら. While it can be translated as \"that blasted (A)\" or \"that damn (A)\", the literal meaning is \"when it comes to (A)\". It directly follows nouns and typically appears in kana.\n\n*Important Considerations*\n\nIn line with its literal meaning, 「ときたら」 can also highlight something about (A) that is \"to be expected\" or \"only natural\". Whether it expresses frustration or expectation is usually clear from the context of the sentence.",
