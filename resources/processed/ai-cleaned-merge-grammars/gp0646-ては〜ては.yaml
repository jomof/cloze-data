        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "Expresses continuous repetition or alternation between two actions, often implying a cycle or a state of continuous movement.",
        "nuance": "This pattern frequently implies a tiresome or frustrating repetition, or a deliberate back-and-forth action. The actions A and B often contrast each other, such as starting and stopping, or moving forward and backward."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ては〜ては」 is derived from the combination of the 「て」-form of a verb, indicating sequential actions, and the particle 「は」, which, in this context, emphasizes the repetition or contrast between the actions. The repeated use of 「ては」 highlights the cyclical nature of the actions described.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「{ては〜ては}」 highlights the continuous repetition of two distinct actions, (A) and (B). It signifies a back-and-forth cycle, meaning 'doing (A) and then (B) repeatedly.' These actions, (A) and (B), frequently represent contrasting states or movements, such as connecting and disconnecting, or advancing and retreating.\n\nThis pattern exclusively employs verbs in their 「て」-form. Consequently, depending on the verb, it may appear as 「では〜では」 (e.g., from verbs ending in -む, -ぶ, -ぬ). Additionally, more casual, contracted forms like 「〜ちゃ〜ちゃ」 or 「〜じゃ〜じゃ」 can be used (e.g., 「食べちゃ寝ちゃ」 for 「食べては寝て」). However, it is crucial to maintain a consistent level of formality throughout the phrase; mixing formal 「ては」 with casual contractions like 「ちゃ」 within the same 「{ては〜ては}」 construction would sound unnatural.\n\nIt is important to note that the single 「〜ては」 can also convey repetition, particularly when the context or the remainder of the sentence clearly indicates an ongoing, repeated action. In such cases, the second 「ては」 can be omitted without changing the repetitive meaning.",

            "nuance": "While `〜たり〜たりする` lists non-exhaustive examples of actions, `ては〜ては` emphasizes a direct, continuous, and often contrasting alternation between two specific actions, indicating a cycle rather than a simple list."

            "term": "〜ごとに",
            "meaning": "every time / each time",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": " `〜ごとに` focuses on regularity or frequency at specific intervals, indicating 'each time' a certain condition or period occurs. In contrast, `ては〜ては` describes a continuous, alternating back-and-forth or repeating cycle between two specific actions."

            "nuance": "A simple `て-form` sequence (e.g., `AしてBして`) denotes sequential actions. `ては〜ては`, however, specifically highlights the *repetition* or *alternation* of those actions, often implying a cycle or a state of continuous movement between the two rather than a one-time sequence."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While `ては〜ては` indicates a specific, often immediate, repetition or alternation between two actions, other grammatical structures offer similar but distinct meanings. `〜たり〜たりする` can describe multiple actions, but it usually implies a non-exhaustive list of varied activities rather than a strict back-and-forth cycle. `〜ごとに` focuses on actions that happen at regular intervals or each time a certain event occurs. Simple `て-form` sequences like `〜して、〜して` denote one-time sequential actions without emphasizing ongoing repetition. Understanding these distinctions is key to using `ては〜ては` accurately to express continuous, often cyclical, actions.",
