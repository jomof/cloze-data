    "etymology": "「へ」 is a particle indicating direction, while 「行く (いく)」 is the verb \"to go.\" Together, 「へいく」 literally means \"to go in the direction of\" or \"to head towards.\"",
    "writeup": "「へいく」 is a fundamental expression used to describe movement towards a specific place or direction. While the particles 「に」 and 「へ」 are often interchangeable, there is a subtle but important nuance: 「へ」 emphasizes the **direction or the journey**, while 「に」 emphasizes the **destination itself**. Therefore, 「へいく」 focuses more on the act of moving towards a place rather than solely on the arrival at it. This makes it versatile for various contexts, from casual conversation to more formal declarations of intent. Understanding this distinction is crucial for expressing precise nuances of movement in Japanese.",
