    "etymology": "「へ」 is a particle indicating direction, while 「行く (いく)」 is the verb \"to go.\" Together, 「へいく」 literally means \"to go in the direction of\" or \"to head towards.\"",
    "writeup": "「へいく」 is a common and fundamental expression used to describe heading towards a specific place or direction. While the particles 「に」 and 「へ」 are often interchangeable, 「へ」 emphasizes the **direction or the journey**, while 「に」 emphasizes the **destination itself**. Thus, 「へいく」 focuses more on the act of moving towards a place rather than arriving at it. It is versatile and used in various contexts, from everyday conversations to more formal settings. It's crucial for expressing movement and direction in Japanese.",
