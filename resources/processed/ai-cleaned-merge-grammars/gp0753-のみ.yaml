        "function": "Expresses limitation, restriction, or exclusivity.",
        "nuance": "Implies that there is nothing else besides the stated element or action.",

    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「のみ」 stems from classical Japanese, where it functioned as a limiting particle. Its origin is often associated with the combination of the genitive particle 「の」 and the suffix 「み」, which conveys the sense of 'extent' or 'limitation to just that'. This classical usage evolved into its modern meaning of 'only' or 'just', carrying a more formal and emphatic nuance than its contemporary counterpart 「だけ」.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「のみ」 indicates that something is limited to a single item, action, or state. It is similar to 「だけ」 but is generally considered more formal and is often found in written language. It emphasizes that **nothing else** is included or possible. It directly follows a noun or, when used with a verb, the verb's dictionary form followed by 「だ」. For example, 「食べる{のみ}だ」 means 'I'm just going to eat.'",
