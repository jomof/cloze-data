    "writeup": "The particle 「のみ」 means \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"nothing but.\" It limits the scope of a noun or verb, emphasizing that nothing else is involved. It is more formal than 「だけ」 and is frequently found in written language or formal speech.  「のみ」 can attach directly to nouns or follow particles like 「に」 or 「を」. When used with a verb, it's often in the form 「verb + のみだ」, expressing the idea that there's nothing left to do but that verb. This grammar point is versatile but should be employed with consideration of register, because 「だけ」 is generally preferred in conversation. 「のみ」 is not gendered.",
    "etymology": "「のみ」 originates from the verb 「飲む (nomu)」, meaning \"to drink\" or \"to swallow.\" The connection is somewhat abstract, but it carries the nuance of something being completely consumed or limited to a single instance.",
