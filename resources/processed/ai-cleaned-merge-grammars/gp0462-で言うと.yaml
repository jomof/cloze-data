    "etymology": "「で言うと」 is composed of 「で」 (the particle indicating means, method, or context) and 「言うと」 (the conditional form of the verb 「言う」, meaning 'to say'). Therefore, the literal breakdown is 'if you were to say with/by means of'.",
    "writeup": "「で言うと」 is a versatile expression used to frame a statement within a specific context or perspective. It functions much like saying \"in terms of X,\" \"speaking of X,\" or \"if we were to put it in X's terms.\"\n\nThis grammar point is particularly useful when you want to:\n*   **Draw comparisons or analogies**: By stating something in terms of another known entity or concept.\n*   **Provide explanations**: By clarifying how something is understood or classified within a particular domain or system.\n*   **Specify a frame of reference**: Indicating the category or viewpoint from which information is being presented.\n\nIt often appears in conjunction with 「～に当たる」 (にあたる), which means \"corresponds to\" or \"is equivalent to,\" further emphasizing the comparative or explanatory nature of the statement.\n\nA common set phrase using this grammar is 「一言で言うと」 (ひとこと で いうと), meaning \"in a word\" or \"to put it simply.\" This specific usage is employed when concisely summarizing complex information into a brief statement.",
