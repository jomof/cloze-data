        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "Used to make comparisons, provide explanations, or specify a frame of reference.",
        "nuance": "This expression implies specifying a context or category within which something is being considered or explained. It helps to clarify the perspective from which a statement is made, often leading to analogies or equivalences.",
        "colocation": "Often used with phrases like 「～に当たる」 (equivalent to) or 「一言で言うと」 (to put it in a word)."
    },
    "etymology": "「で言うと」 is composed of 「で」 (the particle indicating means, method, or context) and 「言うと」 (the conditional form of the verb 「言う」, meaning 'to say'). Therefore, the literal breakdown is 'if you were to say with/by means of'.",
    "writeup": "「で言うと」 is a versatile expression used to frame a statement within a specific context or perspective. It functions much like saying \"in terms of X,\" \"speaking of X,\" or \"if we were to put it in X's terms.\"\n\nThis grammar point is particularly useful when you want to:\n*   **Draw comparisons or analogies**: By stating something in terms of another known entity or concept.\n*   **Provide explanations**: By clarifying how something is understood or classified within a particular domain or system.\n*   **Specify a frame of reference**: Indicating the category or viewpoint from which information is being presented.\n\nIt often appears in conjunction with 「～に当たる」 (にあたる), which means \"corresponds to\" or \"is equivalent to,\" further emphasizing the comparative or explanatory nature of the statement.\n\nA common set phrase using this grammar is 「一言で言うと」 (ひとこと で いうと), meaning \"in a word\" or \"to put it simply.\" This specific usage is employed when concisely summarizing complex information into a brief statement.",

                    "mitigation": "Using 「英語では」 would imply a simple direct translation or equivalence. However, the teacher wants to convey that while 'Thank you for the meal' is a functional translation, the nuance of 'Gochisousamadeshita' is more complex and goes beyond mere verbal thanks, encompassing gratitude for the food, the effort, and the people involved. 「で言うと」 helps frame this discussion within the context of 'speaking in terms of English' while preserving the deeper meaning."
