        "Verb[masu-stem] + Noun": "Transforms a verb into a noun-like form, often representing an action or state as a concept or activity. Functions as a noun within a sentence."

    "jlpt": "N3",
    "meaning": "Turns a verb's masu-stem into a noun, often describing an action or state as a concept.",
    "details": {
        "function": "Nominalization",
        "nuance": "This pattern provides a way to talk about activities or states in a more abstract, conceptual way.",
        "colocation": "Often used with words like 不足 (fusoku - lack), 過ぎ (sugi - excessive), 応え (kotae - worth, response), 合わせ (awase - together, combine), やすい (yasui - easy to), にくい (nikui - difficult to).",
        "grammatical-role": "The nominalized verb acts as a noun and can serve as a subject, object, or part of a compound noun.",
        "temporal-flow": "Refers to the state or action of the verb in a general sense, not bound to a specific tense, but rather the concept of the action."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point utilizes the 「ます」 stem (masu-kei) of a verb. Historically, the 「ます」 stem itself has roots in classical Japanese, where certain verb forms could function nominally. In modern Japanese, dropping 「ます」 to form the masu-stem inherently carries a sense of an unfinished or connecting form. When combined with a noun, it allows the action or state of the verb to be reified, becoming a conceptual entity. This is an efficient way to create new compound nouns or expressions that refer to an action as a concept rather than a specific event.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point transforms a verb into a noun by using its **masu-stem** form (the part of the verb that precedes 「ます」 in the polite form). This allows you to treat the action or state described by the verb as a noun, which can then function as the subject, object, or complement in a sentence. It provides a flexible way to discuss activities or states in a more abstract or conceptual manner.\n\nFor example, from 「泳ぐ (oyogu - to swim)」, the masu-stem is 「泳ぎ (oyogi)」. When used as a noun, 「泳ぎ」 can refer to \"swimming\" as an activity or style. Similarly, 「読む (yomu - to read)」 yields 「読み (yomi)」, meaning \"reading\" as a concept or act.\n\nThis construction is highly productive and is frequently encountered in various contexts, including:\n*   **Compound nouns**: Forming new words like 「待ち合わせ (machiawase - meeting place/time)」 from 「待つ (matsu - to wait)」 and 「合わせる (awaseru - to combine)」.\n*   **Idiomatic expressions**: Such as 「読み応えがある (yomigotae ga aru - to be worth reading)」.\n*   **Referring to states or conditions**: Like 「寝不足 (nebusoku - lack of sleep)」 from 「寝る (neru - to sleep)」 and 「不足 (fusoku - lack)」.\n\nThis structure enables concise and natural expression, allowing speakers to refer to the essence of an action rather than a particular instance.",
