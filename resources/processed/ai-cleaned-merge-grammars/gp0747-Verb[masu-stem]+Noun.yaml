        "Verb[masu-stem] + Noun": "Transforms a verb into a noun-like form, often representing an action or state as a concept or activity. Functions as a noun within a sentence."
    },
    "jlpt": "N3",
    "meaning": "Turns a verb's masu-stem into a noun, often describing an action or state as a concept.",
    "details": {
        "Function": "Nominalization",
        "Usage": "Used to treat verbs as nouns, allowing them to function as subjects, objects, or complements in sentences.",
        "Register": "General",
        "Nuance": "This pattern provides a way to talk about activities or states in a more abstract, conceptual way."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point involves taking the 「ます」 stem (masu-kei) of a verb and using it with a noun. The 「ます」 stem is formed by dropping the 「ます」 from the polite form of the verb. By itself, it is not a complete word, but by treating it as a noun in this grammar point, you turn the verb into a concept.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point transforms a verb into a noun by using the **masu-stem** form (the verb form before 「ます」). This allows you to treat the action of the verb as a noun, which can then be used as the subject, object, or complement in a sentence. It is a way of discussing activities or states as concepts.\n\nFor example, 「泳ぎ (oyogi)」, the masu-stem of 「泳ぐ (oyogu)」 (to swim), can be used to mean \"swimming\" as an activity. Similarly, 「読み (yomi)」, from 「読む (yomu)」 (to read), becomes \"reading\". \n\nThis construction is commonly used to describe habits, preferences, or to generally refer to the action of the verb.",
