    "etymology": "The term 「ますます」 originates from the stacking of 「増す」, a verb meaning \"to increase.\" This etymology highlights the expression's core meaning of continuous growth or intensification. While sometimes written as 「益々」, using the kanji 「益」 (meaning \"gain\") doesn't alter the nuance; the hiragana form 「ますます」 is more common.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「ますます」 signifies an ongoing trend, translating to \"increasingly,\" \"more and more,\" or \"to keep (doing).\" It emphasizes the continuation of a state or action and often appears at the beginning of a sentence. While the kanji form 「益々」 exists, it's less frequent, and the meaning remains identical. The core idea stems from 「増す」 (to increase), so 「ますます」 commonly modifies verbs indicating change or adjectives that intensify. While it can mean \"less and less,\" this signifies an *increasingly negative* situation.",
