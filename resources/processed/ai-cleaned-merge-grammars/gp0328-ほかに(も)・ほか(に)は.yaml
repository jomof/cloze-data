    "etymology": "「ほか」 means 'other' or 'another'. 「に」 is a particle indicating direction or location. 「も」 adds the meaning of 'also' or 'too', while 「は」 is a topic marker, often used to highlight or contrast something.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「ほかに」 is quite versatile and important for N4 level learners. 「他」 by itself means \"another\" or \"other\". The particle 「に」 marks 「他」 ('another thing') as the target of the following statement. Let's break down the possibilities:\n\n*   「ほかに」: Another thing.\n*   「ほかに(も)」: Even another thing (implies less certainty).\n*   「ほか(に)は」: Was there another thing? (Focuses on a pre-existing thing that may have been forgotten).\n*   「他の + Noun」: Another 'specific thing'.\n\n「ほかに(は)」 can be used in both positive and negative sentences, but it often appears in negative sentences. Because 「ほかに(も)」 focuses on adding another item, it's generally not used in negative sentences (except for questions).",
