formation:
  お/ご + Verb stem + 願う: Used to politely request someone to do something. The 'verb stem' is often a noun
    that acts as the stem of a suru-verb, or the 連用形 (ren'yōkei) of a Japanese verb.

    loanwords used with the お〜願う grammar point are omitted.
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Keigo (honorific speech)
  function: To make a polite or humble request.
  nuance: This expression is more polite and formal than お〜ください or てください, often used in business, official
    settings, or when addressing superiors. It can sound stiff or sarcastic if used in casual contexts.
  grammatical-role: honorific expression
etymology: This expression is derived from the humble form of 「願う (negau)」, which means "to request" or
  "to wish for." Adding 「お (o)」 or 「ご (go)」 before the verb stem makes the request more polite and humble,
  emphasizing respect towards the listener.
writeup: |-
  「お〜願う」 is a humble speech expression used to make polite requests. It functions similarly to 「お〜ください」 but conveys a higher level of politeness and deference. The usage typically follows a pattern where 「お」 is prefixed to verbs of Japanese origin, while 「ご」 is used for verbs formed from Sino-Japanese words (words derived from Chinese kanji).

  The verb 「願う」 itself is a う-verb meaning "to petition" or "to request." The literal interpretation of 「お〜願う」 is akin to "I petition that you do (A) for me," which highlights the speaker's humble stance and the listener's role in fulfilling a request.

  Due to its inherent politeness, 「お〜願う」 almost always appears in its polite ます-form, 「お〜願います」. Another common variant is the potential form, 「お〜願えますか」, which softens the request further by framing it as a question of the listener's capability or willingness.

  For words of Western origin (loanwords written in katakana), both 「お」 and 「ご」 are often omitted, and the loanword is simply followed by 「願う」 (e.g., 「サイン願います」).

  **Important Considerations:**
  「お〜願う」 is significantly more formal than 「お〜ください」 or even the simple 「てください」. Consequently, its use is largely confined to highly formal circumstances, such as business correspondence, official announcements, public instructions, or requests made to superiors. If used in everyday, casual conversation, it can sound overly stiff, unnatural, or even sarcastic, depending on the tone and context. It is generally not used by younger people in casual settings.

  - term: ないでください
    meaning: Please don't (Polite request)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「お〜願う」, 「ないでください」 asks someone *not* to do something, expressing a negative request.
    grammar_point: ないでください (please don't)
  - term: てください
    meaning: Please do (Polite request)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「お〜願う」 is significantly more polite and formal than 「てください」. Use 「お〜願う」 in highly formal situations
      or when showing maximum deference.
    grammar_point: てください (polite request)
  - term: なさい
    meaning: Command to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なさい」 is a direct command, often used by superiors to subordinates or parents to children.
      In contrast, 「お〜願う」 is a polite request, not a command.
    grammar_point: なさい (polite imperative)
  - term: お〜ください
    meaning: Please do (Honorific)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「お〜願う」 is a more humble and indirect way of expressing a request compared to 「お〜ください」, making
      it even more polite and formal. While both are honorific, 「お〜願う」 emphasizes the speaker's humility.
    grammar_point: お〜ください (polite request)
  - term: お願いする (to humbly request)
    meaning: To make a general request or ask for a favor
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「お願いする」 is a common polite phrase for general requests or favors (e.g., ご協力お願いします). In contrast,
      「お〜願う」 is more specific, formally requesting someone to perform a particular action, often by attaching
      it to a verb stem (e.g., ご署名願います).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:お願いする (to humbly request)
  - term: ていただけませんか
    meaning: Could you please (receive a favor)?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ていただけませんか」 focuses on the speaker's benefit from the listener's action, framed as receiving
      a favor. 「お〜願う」 emphasizes the speaker's humble desire for the listener to act, without necessarily
      highlighting the benefit to the speaker.
    grammar_point: Verb[て]+いただけませんか (humble request)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「お〜願う」, 「お〜ください」, 「てください」, and 「ていただけませんか」 all express requests, but they
  differ significantly in their level of politeness and the nuance of the request. 「お〜願う」 is the most
  polite and humble, typically reserved for formal contexts, business settings, or when making requests
  to individuals of higher status. 「お〜ください」 is also polite but slightly less formal than 「お〜願う」. 「てください」
  and 「ていただけませんか」 are generally used in more common polite situations, with the latter emphasizing receiving
  a favor. 「お願いする」 is a general request for cooperation or a favor. It is important to distinguish these
  from 「なさい」, which functions as a direct command rather than a polite request.

        english: I apologize, but please confirm this report by the end of today.
        hint: Using 「ご確認願えますか」 instead of 「ご確認ください」 makes the request more tentative and indirect, showing
          greater consideration for the busy senior colleague's time and status, which is appropriate
          in a hierarchical business setting.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 本日 中 に この 報告 書 を {チェック し て ください}。
        english: Please check this report by the end of today.

          in a formal business context. 「ご確認願えますか」 maintains the necessary level of respect and politeness.
    scene: A junior employee asks a busy senior colleague for an urgent review.

        hint: While 「してください」 is polite, 「願います」 adds a layer of formality and a sense of 'we request' or
          'we ask of you,' which is often preferred in customer service or business contexts. We're looking
          for a formal request.
    scene: A salesperson instructing a customer during a transaction at a retail store.
    register: teineigo (polite)

        english: In times of disaster, please follow instructions and evacuate promptly.
        hint: The plain form 「願う」 in official instructions implies a general directive or established
          rule, often from an impersonal authority, rather than a direct appeal to individuals as 「してください」
          would. We're looking for a general, authoritative instruction.
    scene: An official government emergency guideline displayed on a public board.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

          - ちょっと、こっち に {来 て くれる}？
        english: Hey, could you come over here?
        hint: 「来てくれる？」 is a casual request and lacks the ironic formality intended by the speaker. The
          scene sets up a playful, slightly exaggerated tone where the speaker uses overly polite language
          for humor. We're looking for an extremely polite request used humorously in a casual context,
          not a casual request itself.
    scene: A young woman playfully calling over her boyfriend who is distracted by his phone.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: humorous
    conjugation: potential (～られる/～える)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: A younger female speaker uses the highly formal 「お越し願えますか」 in an intimate and casual setting
      with her boyfriend. The unusual formality, especially the humble 「お越し」 (a respectful way of saying
      'to come'), creates a humorous or slightly sarcastic effect, implying that his distraction is a
      minor inconvenience that requires such extreme politeness.

          - こちら で 少々 お 待ち {ください}。
        english: Please wait here for a moment.
        hint: While 「お待ちください」 is polite, 「お待ち願います」 adds a higher degree of formality and humility, often

          request.
    scene: A reception desk at a hospital or clinic, addressing a patient.
    register: teineigo (polite)

          sense of humble appeal, often used in public or corporate statements regarding sensitive issues.
          We're looking for a formal plea for empathy.
    scene: A company spokesperson making a public announcement regarding a difficult business decision
      or policy change.

          - 早々 の ご 返信 を {お 願い し ます}。
        english: We kindly ask for your prompt reply.
        hint: 「お願いします」 is a general polite request. While similar, 「願います」 here implies a more formal and
          somewhat demanding request for a response, typical in business correspondence. We're looking
          for a formal, concise business request.
    scene: A formal business email from a company representative to a client or business partner.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)

      a strong, yet polite, request for a prompt response, maintaining the high level of formality expected
      in professional communication.

      - この 件 に つき まし て、ご 検討 の ほど {願い ます}。
      - この 件 に つき まし て、ご 検討 {願い たく 存じ ます}。
    english_literally: Regarding this matter, consideration we request.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 件 に つき まし て、ご 検討 {ください}。
        english: Regarding this matter, please consider it.
        hint: 「ご検討ください」 is a polite request. 「ご検討願います」 adds a more humble and deferential tone, suitable
          for requests directed to superiors or within a formal organizational hierarchy. We're looking
          for a highly formal request for deliberation.
    scene: A manager instructing their team to discuss and deliberate on a new proposal.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: 「ご検討願います」 is frequently used in formal business or academic settings when asking others, particularly
      those in a position of authority or expertise, to review and deliberate on a proposal or issue.
      It conveys respect for their judgment and time.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in these examples, 「お〜願う」 is primarily used in formal or official
  contexts. Its usage in casual or personal settings can sound overly formal, stiff, or even sarcastic,
  depending on the tone and situation. The potential form 「お〜願えますか」 is often employed to soften the request,
  making it sound more indirect and gentle, even within formal speech, or used ironically for comedic
  effect.
