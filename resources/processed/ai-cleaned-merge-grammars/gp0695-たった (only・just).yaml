writeup: |-
  たった is a common adverb in Japanese that originates from an emphasized alteration of ただ ('only', 'merely'). たった retains the meaning of ただ by expressing that something is "only (A)", "just (A)", or "no more than (A)".

  This nuance is typically used when the actual number or quantity of (A) is exceptionally low compared to the speaker's expectation or anticipation. For example, if someone expects 10 people but only 2 show up, they might say: **たった**２人しか来なかったね (Only two people came, huh?).

  たった will often appear at the beginning of sentences and can modify the entire sentence, or a specific number when followed by の, as in **たったの**３つ (only three). As たった is an adverb primarily used for emphasis, it frequently accompanies other similar grammatical patterns like だけ (only) or しか (only, with negative connotation).

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   When used with time expressions, such as **たった今** (tatta ima), it emphasizes that something happened "just now" or "right this instant," highlighting the immediate past.
  *   It can also be used to emphasize singularity, such as **たった一人** (tatta hitori), meaning "only one person" or "all alone."

  - term: 僅かに
    meaning: Only, slightly, a little, barely, merely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike たった, 僅かに (wazukani) often describes a small degree or amount in a neutral sense, rather
      than highlighting an unexpectedly low quantity or emphasizing singularity. It can refer to a subtle
      difference or a barely perceptible quantity.
    grammar_point: 僅かに (only・slightly)
  - term: ばかり
    meaning: Only, just, nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While たった emphasizes a surprisingly small quantity, ばかり can emphasize exclusiveness ("only
      doing X") or totality ("nothing but X"), often without the strong sense of unexpectedness or disappointment
      that たった conveys.
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・just, often with nuance of excess)
  - term: ただ
    meaning: Just; only; merely; common; ordinary; plain
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ただ is broader than たった. While ただ can mean "only" or "just" in a neutral way, たった specifically
      highlights an unexpectedly small amount or quantity, often with a sense of surprise or disappointment.
      ただ can also mean "ordinary" or "free," which たった does not.
    grammar_point: ただ (the only thing is)
  - term: だけ
    meaning: Only, just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While たった emphasizes a surprisingly or disappointingly small quantity, だけ simply indicates
      exclusivity or limitation without carrying the same emotional connotation of unexpectedness. For
      example, 「３人だけ来た」 (only 3 people came) is a neutral statement, whereas 「たった３人しか来なかった」 (only 3 people
      came, implying disappointment) expresses a strong feeling.
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: しか〜ない
    meaning: Nothing but, only (with negative nuance)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: しか～ない inherently conveys a sense of insufficiency or regret, meaning 'only X and nothing more/better.'
      たった, while often used to reinforce this feeling of surprising smallness, can also be used in neutral
      or even positive contexts (e.g., describing an impressively short time) where しか～ない would not fit.
      たった emphasizes the smallness itself, while しか～ない emphasizes the negative implication of that smallness.
    grammar_point: しか〜ない (only, nothing but)
  - term: せめて
    meaning: At least
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: たった expresses that something is only a surprisingly small amount, often with disappointment
      or surprise. In contrast, せめて expresses a desire for at least a minimum amount, often implying that
      more would be better, or that this minimum is needed to make a situation bearable. It points to
      a lower bound you're hoping for, rather than an upper limit that surprises you.
    grammar_point: せめて (at least)
  - term: ほんの
    meaning: Just a little, merely, slight
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ほんの is used to describe a small, slight, or negligible amount in a neutral or casual way,
      similar to 'just a little.' たった, however, highlights that the quantity is surprisingly small, often
      evoking a sense of disappointment, understatement, or impressiveness depending on context. ほんの doesn't
      carry this emotional weight or element of surprise.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ほんの (just a little)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that たった emphasizes a surprisingly small quantity
  or singular existence, often carrying a sense of speaker surprise or mild disappointment. In contrast,
  僅かに describes a small degree or amount in a more neutral sense, without necessarily implying a deviation
  from expectation. For instance, 僅かに残っている (only a little remains) simply states a small quantity, whereas
  たった３人しか来なかった (only three people came) implies the speaker expected more. While ばかり can also mean 'only',
  it often highlights exclusivity or totality, like 'only doing X' or 'nothing but X', without the strong
  sense of unexpectedness or disappointment found in たった. Furthermore, ただ means 'only' or 'just' in a
  general, neutral way, and can also denote 'ordinary' or 'free,' meanings not shared by たった, which is
  specifically about emphasizing an unexpectedly small quantity. 「だけ」is a neutral term for 'only' or 'just',
  unlike たった which adds an element of surprise or disappointment regarding the smallness. 「しか～ない」inherently
  carries a negative nuance of insufficiency, which is amplified by たった but not interchangeable. 「せめて」expresses
  a desire for a minimum, contrasting with たった's emphasis on a surprisingly small maximum. 「ほんの」describes
  a small amount neutrally, lacking the surprise or emotional weight of たった.

  - english: Professor Yamada, I just now returned to the lab.
    japanese:
      - 山田 先生、{たった 今} 研究 室 に 戻り まし た。
      - 山田 先生、{たった 今} 研究 室 に 戻っ て 参り まし た。
      - 山田 先生、{たった 今} 研究 室 に 戻っ た ところ です。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 山田 先生、今 研究 室 に 戻り まし た。
        english: Professor Yamada, I returned to the lab now.
        hint: 「たった今」emphasizes extreme immediacy, like "just this very second." 「今」is a more general "now"
          or "at this moment." We're looking for emphasis on the immediate past.
    scene: A student reports to their professor after a short errand.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    nuance: The usage of 「たった今」here emphasizes the immediacy of the action, conveying that the return
      was just moments ago, rather than simply stating it happened at the present time.
    etymology: 「たった今」is an emphasized form of 「ただ今」 (tadaima), which means "just now." The duplication
      of the 'た' sound intensifies the sense of immediacy. While 「ただ今」 is commonly known from the greeting
      'I'm home,' its original meaning also implies 'just now' or 'right at this moment.' The doubled
      consonant in 「たった」adds a strong, impactful feeling to the timing, making it more forceful and precise
      than a simple 「今」 (ima). This is a common linguistic phenomenon in Japanese, where repeated sounds
      or specific kana patterns can add emphasis or nuance, similar to how sound symbolism (onomatopoeia)
      functions in the language. In this case, the 'tta' sound in 「たった」conveys a sense of suddenness and
      completion right at the present moment, perfectly aligning with 'just now'.
  - english: Boy, you climbed this huge mountain all by yourself? That's amazing!
    japanese:
      - 少年、{たった 一人} で この 巨大 な 山 を 登っ た の か い？すごい な！
      - 少年、{たった 一人} で この 巨大 な 山 を 登っ た の？すごい な！
      - 少年、{たった 一人} で この 巨大 な 山 を 登り 切っ た の か。たいした もん だ！

          - 少年、一人 で この 巨大 な 山 を 登っ た の か い？すごい な！
        english: Boy, did you climb this huge mountain by yourself? That's amazing!
        hint: 「たった一人で」emphasizes the impressive singularity of climbing alone, implying it's a surprising
          feat. 「一人で」simply states that one person did it. We're looking for strong emphasis on the singular
          effort.
    scene: An experienced mountaineer meets a young boy at the summit of a challenging mountain.
    register: casual
    setting: inspirational
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 少年 implies addressing a boy, and the exclamation すごいな！ is a casual, appreciative
      remark often used by an older male speaker. 「たった一人」emphasizes the unexpected feat of climbing alone,
      highlighting the boy's impressive determination and the speaker's surprise at the singular effort.
    etymology: The phrase 「たった一人」(tatta hitori) comes from 「たった」 (tatta), meaning "only" or "just," combined
      with 「一人」 (hitori), meaning "one person." The intensifier 「たった」highlights the singularity or isolation
      in a surprising or significant way. It's often used to express admiration for someone's independence
      or resilience, especially when facing a challenge alone, or to convey loneliness or helplessness
      in being completely by oneself.
  - english: I invited everyone in my class, but only 4 people showed up.

      - クラス の 皆 を 呼ん だ の に、{たった} ４ 人 しか 来 て くれ なかっ た。
      - クラス の 皆 を 呼ん だ ん だ けど、{たっ た の} ４ 人 しか 来 なかっ た ん だ。

        english: I invited everyone in my class, but only 4 people came.
        hint: 「たったの」emphasizes that the number is *surprisingly and disappointingly* small. 「しか～なかった」already
          implies 'only,' but adding 「たったの」amplifies the speaker's negative feeling about it. We're looking
          for strong emphasis on the unexpected smallness of the number.
    scene: A teenager confides in a friend about their disappointing birthday party attendance.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: The combination of 「たったの」and 「しか～なかった」strongly conveys the speaker's disappointment and dismay
      at the unexpectedly low turnout. 「たったの」amplifies the feeling that the number is shockingly small,
      making the negative outcome more impactful.
    etymology: The usage of 「たったの」before a number, as in 「たったの４人」(tatta no yo-nin), emphasizes the surprising
      smallness of that quantity. The particle 「の」(no) acts as a nominalizer, allowing 「たった」to directly
      modify the number. This structure highlights that the quantity is far less than expected or desired.
      It builds upon the core meaning of 「たった」 as an intensifier for scarcity or singularity. This particular
      construction with 「の」is very common when specifying a quantity or measure, underlining the unexpectedness
      of its smallness. For example, 「たったの10分」(tatta no jippun) would mean "only 10 minutes" implying
      surprise at the short duration.
  - english: This restaurant is only 50 meters from the station!
    japanese:

          - この レストラン は 駅 から ５０ メートル です！
        english: This restaurant is 50 meters from the station!
        hint: 「たったの」is used to emphasize that the distance is *surprisingly* short and convenient. Stating
          just the number is neutral. We're looking for emphasis on how short the distance is.
    scene: A real estate agent points out the convenience of a restaurant's location to a potential buyer.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: persuasive
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: In a persuasive context, 「たったの」highlights the surprisingly close proximity, making it a significant
      selling point that emphasizes convenience. It implies that 50 meters is an impressively short distance,
      exceeding expectations for a commercial location.
    etymology: The use of 「たったの」before a measurement like 「５０メートル」(gojuu meeru, 50 meters) serves to emphasize
      the unexpectedly small or convenient nature of that measurement. It's a rhetorical device used to
      make a quantity seem exceptionally low or favorable. For instance, in a sales context, it highlights
      value or ease. It draws attention to the fact that the actual amount is surprisingly minimal, contrasting
      with a potential expectation of a larger or less convenient measure. This usage perfectly aligns
      with the core function of 「たった」 as an intensifier for smallness or singularity.
  - english: Excuse me, but the plane has just taken off, so please take the next flight.
    japanese:
      - 恐れ入り ます が、飛行 機 は {たった 今} 離陸 し まし た の で、次 の 便 を ご 利用 ください。
      - 恐れ入り ます が、飛行 機 は {たった 今} 離陸 いたし まし た。つき まし て は、次 の 便 を ご 利用 ください。
      - 恐れ入り ます が、飛行 機 は {たった 今} 離陸 の 最中 で ご ざ い ます。次 の 便 を ご 利用 ください。

        english: Excuse me, but the plane has taken off now, so please take the next flight.
        hint: 「たった今」implies the action occurred *at that very instant*, leaving no room for doubt. 「今」is
          more general, meaning "now" or "at this moment." We're looking for the most precise and immediate
          timing.
    scene: A flight attendant informs a late passenger about their missed flight.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The phrase 「たった今」is used here to denote extreme recency, emphasizing that the plane's departure
      was mere moments ago. This leaves no ambiguity about the impossibility of boarding, serving as a
      polite but firm statement in a formal setting. The use of 「恐れ入りますが」and 「ご」before 「利用ください」further
      elevates the formality and politeness.
    etymology: As noted before, 「たった今」is an emphasized form of 「ただ今」 (tadaima), meaning "just now." The
      doubling of the 'た' sound and the small 'っ' (sokuon) intensifies the sense of immediacy. In this
      formal context, it provides an undeniable and precise temporal reference, leaving no room for argument
      or misunderstanding about the timing of the plane's departure. The historical roots in 「ただ」 (only,
      merely) show how a simple concept of limitation or exactness can evolve into a strong temporal marker
      when intensified.
  - english: My friend said they wanted to see a movie, but I only have 300 yen.

      - 友達 が 映画 を 見 た い と 言っ た が、私 に は {たっ た の} ３００ 円 しか ない。
      - 友達 が 映画 見 たい って 言う から さ、で も 私、{たった} ３００ 円 しか 持っ て ない ん だ よ ね。

        english: My friend said they want to see a movie, but for me, only 300 yen exists.
        hint: 「たった」emphasizes that the amount is *surprisingly and regrettably* small. 「しか～ない」already
          conveys "only," but 「たった」adds a stronger sense of insufficiency and disappointment. We're looking
          for emphasis on the meager amount.
    scene: A person internally laments their lack of money while considering a friend's movie suggestion.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The combination of 「たった」 and 「しか～ない」 (shika nai) powerfully conveys the speaker's disappointment
      and frustration with the meager amount of money they possess. It emphasizes that 300 yen is an extremely
      insufficient sum for the intended purpose, especially when talking to oneself.
    etymology: When 「たった」is used before a specific quantity like 「３００円」(sanbyaku en, 300 yen) and paired
      with 「しか～ない」(shika~nai, only... not), it forms a strong expression of negative limitation, implying
      that the amount is surprisingly and disappointingly small. 「しか～ない」itself already conveys a sense
      of insufficiency, but 「たった」amplifies this feeling, adding a layer of personal frustration or lament.
      This usage highlights the gap between expectation and reality, making the scarcity more prominent.
      It signifies that the amount is 'mere' or 'paltry' in the speaker's eyes. The pairing is extremely
      common for expressing dissatisfaction with a small number or amount.

        english: I can't believe she solved that difficult puzzle in 1 minute!
        hint: 「たった」highlights the *unexpectedly brief* duration for a difficult task, emphasizing how
          impressive it is. Without it, it's just a statement of fact about the time taken. We're looking
          for emphasis on the surprisingly short time.
    scene: A person expresses utter disbelief and astonishment at someone's speed in solving a complex
      task.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The exclamation 「信じられない！」 (shinjirarenai!) expresses extreme disbelief. 「たった」highlights the
      surprisingly brief duration, emphasizing the impressive speed rather than just the passage of time.
      This usage makes the accomplishment seem extraordinary, amplifying the speaker's astonishment.
    etymology: The use of 「たった」before a unit of time, such as 「１分」(ippun, 1 minute), emphasizes the unexpected
      brevity of that duration. It conveys a strong sense of surprise or astonishment that something could
      be completed in such a short period. This is particularly effective when the task is described as
      「難しい」(muzukashii, difficult), as it accentuates the remarkable nature of the achievement. 「たった」in
      this context functions as an intensifier for 'scarcity' of time, making the minimal duration highly
      impactful. It elevates a simple statement of time into an expression of awe or disbelief.

        english: My son stayed in the hospital by himself during his illness.
        hint: 「たった一人で」emphasizes the son's *complete isolation and loneliness* in a difficult situation,
          evoking sympathy. 「一人で」simply states he was alone. We're looking for emphasis on his vulnerable
          solitude.
    scene: A worried mother confides in a friend about her son's lonely hospital stay.
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The usage of 「たった一人」emphasizes the son's complete isolation during a difficult time, highlighting
      the mother's concern and sympathy for his experience. The nuance of 「たった一人」here conveys a sense
      of pathos and vulnerability, which aligns well with empathetic expressions often found in female
      speech.
    etymology: As previously mentioned, 「たった一人」(tatta hitori) intensifies the concept of being alone or
      singular. In this context, it draws attention to the child's complete isolation during a vulnerable
      time of illness, emphasizing the emotional burden or difficulty of being without companionship or
      support. It evokes sympathy by stressing the solitude, making the listener feel for the situation.
      It conveys a stronger emotional weight than a simple factual statement of 「一人で」(hitori de, by oneself).

        hint: 「たった」is used in advertising to highlight that the price is *exceptionally and surprisingly*
          low, making the offer very attractive. Without it, it's just the price. We're looking for emphasis
          on the amazing value.
    scene: A restaurant advertises a special promotional offer to attract customers.
    register: casual
    setting: persuasive
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The phrases 期間限定！ (kikan gentei!, limited time offer) and 食べ放題です！ (tabehoudai desu!, all-you-can-eat!)
      are typical of advertising. 「たった」emphasizes the incredibly low price, making the offer appealing
      to a broad audience (hence 'group' listener) and encouraging immediate action by highlighting the
      exceptional value.
    etymology: In advertising and promotional contexts, 「たった」is strategically used before a price like
      「５００円」(go-hyaku en, 500 yen) to highlight it as surprisingly low and thus incredibly attractive.
      It creates a sense of an exceptional deal, emphasizing the smallness of the cost relative to the
      value received. This persuasive use aligns with the core meaning of 「たった」 as an intensifier for
      'only' or 'just,' making the quantity (in this case, price) appear minimal and highly advantageous
      to the consumer. It's a common technique to imply that the price is unexpectedly affordable, inciting
      a sense of urgency and good fortune.

          - 彼女 は 私 に とっ て、一人 の 大切 な 親友 です。
        english: She is, for me, my precious best friend.
        hint: 「たった一人」emphasizes that she is the *one and only, irreplaceable* best friend, conveying a
          deep, exclusive bond. 「一人」simply means "one person." We're looking for strong emphasis on her
          unique and singular importance.
    scene: A person expresses the deep significance of a particular friend to them.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    nuance: The phrase 「たった一人」emphasizes the absolute singularity and irreplaceable nature of the friendship,
      conveying that there is no other friend quite like her. It adds a strong sense of exclusivity and
      a deep, intimate bond.
    etymology: When 「たった一人」(tatta hitori) is used in contexts describing relationships, such as 「たった一人の大切な親友」(tatta
      hitori no taisetsu na shin'yuu), it means "my one and only precious best friend." This phrase goes
      beyond simply stating that there is 'one' best friend; it conveys a profound sense of uniqueness
      and irreplaceability. The intensifier 「たった」highlights the singularity of the individual as exceptional
      and irreplaceable, underscoring the deep emotional connection and the cherished nature of the relationship.
      It expresses that this person stands alone in their importance to the speaker. This usage taps into
      the emotional depth of the grammar point's core meaning.

        english: Even though I practiced hard for two weeks, I could only score 50 points on the test.
        hint: 「たった」emphasizes the *disappointingly low* score despite significant effort. 「しか～なかった」already
          implies 'only', but 「たった」amplifies the speaker's frustration and disappointment. We're looking
          for strong emphasis on the unexpectedly meager result.
    scene: A student expresses frustration to their friend about a disappointing test result.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: The combination of 「たった」 and 「しか～なかった」 powerfully conveys the speaker's strong disappointment
      and frustration with the unexpectedly low score, especially when contrasted with the effort (二週間も一生懸命練習した).
    etymology: Similar to previous examples, 「たった」 used before a number like 「５０点」(gojitten, 50 points)
      emphasizes that this quantity is surprisingly small and below expectation. When combined with 「しか～ない」(shika~nai)
      in a negative context, it strongly expresses dissatisfaction or disappointment, highlighting the
      disparity between effort and result. This intensifies the sense of 'only' or 'just' to convey a
      lamentable outcome.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 眠り に 落ち て から ５ 分 で 目 が 覚め た。
        english: I woke up in five minutes after falling asleep.
        hint: 「たった」emphasizes the *surprisingly short* duration of sleep, often implying a sense of annoyance
          or disbelief. Without it, it's a neutral statement of time. We're looking for emphasis on the
          unexpectedly brief period.
    scene: A person expresses frustration or surprise at waking up too soon after falling asleep.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of 「たった」before the short time duration (５分) highlights the speaker's surprise, and
      likely frustration or dissatisfaction, at the unexpectedly brief period of sleep. It conveys a sense
      of 'only just 5 minutes' rather than simply '5 minutes'.
    etymology: Using 「たった」with a time duration like 「５分」(go-fun, 5 minutes) emphasizes the extreme brevity
      of that period, often implying a sense of disbelief or an unexpectedly short span. It intensifies
      the idea of 'only' or 'just' to stress the minimal passage of time, which can evoke feelings of
      surprise, disappointment, or even annoyance, depending on the context. This emphasizes the smallness
      of the quantity (time) in a way that highlights the speaker's emotional reaction.
  - english: This tiny store sells handmade jewelry, but it's only open on Tuesdays.
    japanese:
      - この 小さな 店 は ハンドメイド ジュエリー を 売っ て いる が、{たった} 火曜 日 に しか 開い て い ない。
      - この 小さな 店 は ハンドメイド ジュエリー を 売っ て いる が、{たっ た の} 火曜 日 に しか 開い て い ない。
      - この 小さな お 店、手作り アクセサリー 売っ てる ん だ けど、{たった} 火曜 日 に しか 開か ない ん だ よ ね。
    english_literally: This tiny store sells handmade jewelry, but it only opens on Tuesdays.

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 小さな 店 は ハンドメイド ジュエリー を 売っ て いる が、火曜 日 に しか 開い て い ない。
        english: This tiny store sells handmade jewelry, but it only opens on Tuesdays.
        hint: 「たった」emphasizes that the limited opening day is *surprisingly restrictive*, often with a
          sense of inconvenience. 「しか～ない」already means 'only', but 「たった」amplifies the feeling of restriction.
          We're looking for emphasis on the unexpectedly narrow timeframe.
    scene: Two friends discuss a small shop with unique items but very limited operating hours.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: The combination of 「たった」and 「しか～ない」conveys a sense of the speaker's mild frustration or surprise
      at the very restrictive operating hours of the shop, highlighting the inconvenience of it being
      open 'only' on one specific day.
    etymology: The use of 「たった」before a specific day, like 「火曜日」(kayoubi, Tuesday), when combined with
      「しか～ない」(shika~nai), emphasizes the unexpected and restrictive nature of the limitation. It implies
      that the constraint is unusually narrow, leading to a sense of slight disappointment or inconvenience.
      The intensifying effect of 「たった」makes the 'only' more impactful, drawing attention to the surprisingly
      limited availability.
post_example_writeup: While 「たった(の)」is often used to express a surprisingly small quantity or a sense
  of disappointment, as you've seen in many examples, it can also be employed to highlight something as
  exceptionally singular or unique, especially when expressing appreciation or emphasis. For instance,
  「たった一人」can convey loneliness, but also deep admiration for someone's solo accomplishment, or the unique
  importance of a single person in one's life. The context and accompanying words are crucial for discerning
  the precise nuance.
