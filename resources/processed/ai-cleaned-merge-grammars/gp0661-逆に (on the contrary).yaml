jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General use
  function: Introduces a statement that is contrary to what was expected, previously stated, or generally
    believed. Can also introduce a counter-argument or an alternative viewpoint in a discussion. In very
    casual contexts, it can express a deferral or a turning of a question back to the other person.
  nuance: Ranges from a neutral indication of reversal or opposition to a nuance of surprise, disappointment,
    or a strong rebuttal depending on context. Can also be used informally to prompt the other person
    for their preference or opinion.
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially, modifying verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses. It acts as
    a conjunction connecting ideas that are in opposition or contrast to each other.
  logical-flow: Signals a shift from an expected outcome or common understanding to an opposite or unexpected
    reality. It disrupts a straightforward cause-and-effect or widely held belief with a contrasting idea.
etymology: 「逆に」is derived from the noun 「逆 (gyaku)」 meaning "reverse" or "opposite," combined with the
  particle 「に (ni)」, which in this case functions to turn the noun into an adverb. Therefore, 「逆に」literally
  means "in the reverse way" or "in the opposite manner." Its use to introduce a counter-argument or unexpected
  outcome directly stems from this core meaning of reversal or opposition.
writeup: 「逆に」is an adverbial expression used to indicate that something is **contrary** to what was previously
  stated or expected. It signals a reversal or opposition to a prior idea. Its core function is to establish
  a contrast, often appearing between two clauses to connect a statement with its unexpected or opposite
  outcome. For instance, if action A was expected to lead to result X, 「逆に」can introduce result Y, which
  is the opposite or unintended consequence of A. This usage often carries a nuance of surprise or disappointment,
  as the actual outcome diverges from what was intended or anticipated.In modern Japanese, 「逆に」is also
  frequently used at the beginning of a sentence. In this context, it functions as a **rebuttal** or a
  way to introduce an **alternative viewpoint** to something that has just been said. This can be a direct
  contradiction or simply a suggestion of a different perspective. Additionally, in very casual conversation,
  「逆に」can be used as a slang version of 「別に」 (not particularly) when asked questions about preferences,
  implying a deferral or a turning of the question back to the other person, as in "rather, how about
  you?" or "instead, what do you think?"

  - term: に反して
    meaning: Go against, Contrary to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「に反して」is used when something goes against a rule, law, expectation, or agreement, whereas
      「逆に」simply indicates something contrary to a previous statement or expectation. 「に反して」has a stronger
      sense of opposition and is often used in more formal contexts.
    grammar_point: に反して (contrary to)
  - term: むしろ
    meaning: Rather, Instead, Over
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「むしろ」is used to express a preference or suggest an alternative that is considered better or
      more suitable than the original option, whereas 「逆に」simply introduces a contrary situation or statement.
      「むしろ」implies a degree of choice or desirability.
    grammar_point: むしろ (rather・instead)
  - term: 却って
    meaning: All the more, On the contrary, Conversely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「却って」is quite similar to 「逆に」 but often emphasizes that the result was contrary to what was
      intended or expected, often with a negative connotation. 「却って」often implies that something made
      a situation worse, while 「逆に」is more neutral.
    grammar_point: 却って (on the contrary)
  - term: ところが
    meaning: Unexpected contrast
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ところが」 introduces a situation that is contrary to expectations, often implying a surprising
      or disappointing turn of events. While 「逆に」 focuses on the *manner* of reversal, 「ところが」 highlights
      the *result* or *fact* of the unexpected contrast.
    grammar_point: ところが (unexpected contrast)
  - term: それどころか
    meaning: Far from that; on the contrary
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「それどころか」 strongly negates a previous statement and introduces something even more extreme
      or entirely opposite. It emphasizes that not only is the previous idea false, but the reality is
      quite the opposite. 「逆に」 can be a neutral shift, but 「それどころか」 is always a strong contradiction.
    grammar_point: それどころか (far from that)
  - term: 一方で (on the other hand・while)
    meaning: While; on the other hand; in contrast; at the same time
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「逆に」 introduces a statement that is *opposite* or *contrary* to an expectation or previous
      statement, 「一方で」 introduces a *contrasting aspect* or a *simultaneous different state or action*.
      It doesn't necessarily imply a reversal, but rather a dual nature or an alternative perspective.
    grammar_point: 一方で (on the other hand・while)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「に反して」, 「むしろ」, 「却って」, 「ところが」, 「それどころか」, and 「一方で」 can all express contrast,
  they have distinct nuances. Use 「に反して」when something violates an agreement or expectation, 「むしろ」to express
  preference, and 「却って」when something results in an an unintended and often negative outcome. 「ところが」 focuses
  on the unexpected result of a situation. 「それどころか」 is used to strongly contradict a previous statement
  and present an even more extreme opposite. 「一方で」 highlights a contrasting aspect or simultaneous different
  state. 「逆に」serves as a more general way to indicate something is contrary to a previous statement.

  - english: I thought using this new app would make the work finish faster, but on the contrary, it took
      more time.

      - この 新しい アプリ を 使え ば 作業 が 早く 終わる と 思っ た の に、{逆 に} 時間 が かかっ て しまい まし た。
      - 新しい アプリ で 早く 終わる と 思っ たら、{逆 に} 時間 が かかっ た。
    english_literally: This new app if use work faster will finish thought, but conversely time took.

      - competing_japanese:
          - '{却って} 時間 が かかっ て しまっ た。'
        english: It took more time, on the contrary (and made things worse).
        hint: 「却って」 emphasizes that the result was unexpectedly worse. We're looking for a simple statement
          that the result was the opposite of what was expected.
    scene: A team leader discussing a project with a colleague, reflecting on a poor choice.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
  - english: My son thought he would be scolded, but on the contrary, seeing his effort, he was praised.
    japanese:

    english_literally: My son scolded would be thought seemed, but his effort seeing conversely was praised.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{却って} 褒め られ た。'
        english: He was praised, on the contrary (even though it was unexpected).
        hint: While 「却って」 can indicate an unexpected outcome, it often implies a negative or counterproductive
          result. Here, we're simply stating the opposite of what was expected.
    scene: A mother talking to another parent about her child's school experience, highlighting an unexpected
      positive outcome.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The speaker is a mother, using a direct and somewhat relieved tone. The phrase 「～と 思っていた らしいが」
      (thought it seemed) shows the son's expectation, while 「{逆に} 褒められた」 (on the contrary, was praised)
      explicitly states the opposite outcome. This expresses a common parental sentiment of pleasant surprise.
  - english: I cut down on sweets for my health, but on the contrary, stress accumulated and I ended up
      eating more.
    japanese:
      - 健康 の ため に 甘い もの を 控え た が、{逆 に} ストレス が 溜まっ て 食べる 量 が 増え た。

      increased.

          - '{却って} ストレス が 溜まっ て 食べる 量 が 増え た。'
        english: On the contrary (and as a worse result), stress accumulated and I ended up eating more.
        hint: 「却って」 specifically implies that the action taken led to an unexpectedly worse or counterproductive
          result. We're looking for a general contrary outcome without necessarily emphasizing a worsening.
    scene: Someone discussing their failed attempt at a diet with a friend, expressing frustration.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
  - english: 'A: Is there anything you want to eat? B: Hmm, not really. Conversely, how about sushi?'
    japanese:
      - A:何 か 食べ たい もの ある？B:うーん、特に ない なあ。{逆 に}、寿司 は どう？
      - A:何 か 食べ たい もの あり ます か？B:うーん、特に ない です ね。{逆 に}、お 寿司 は いかが です か？

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{それ なら} 寿司 は どう？'
        english: In that case, how about sushi?
        hint: 「それなら」 transitions to a new suggestion based on the previous statement. 「逆に」 here implies
          a reversal of who should be suggesting, or a change in perspective from "nothing" to "something
          specific I'm offering as a counter-proposal."
    scene: Two friends deciding on dinner, with one person offering a suggestion after expressing no strong
      preference.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Speaker B, a male, uses 「{逆に}」 here in a common informal way. After stating 「特に ない なあ」 (not
      particularly), he uses 「逆に」 to transition from no preference to suggesting an option, almost like
      saying, 'if you're asking me, how about I turn the question back to you with a suggestion?' This
      adds a relaxed, conversational tone characteristic of close friends.
  - english: It's often thought that not exercising is bad for your body, but excessive exercise can,
      on the contrary, harm your health.
    japanese:

          - '{却って} 健康 を 害する こと も ある。'
        english: Excessive exercise can, on the contrary (and as a worse result), harm your health.
        hint: 「却って」 often highlights an unintended negative consequence. 「逆に」 is broader, simply stating
          the opposite or counter-intuitive reality.
    scene: A doctor giving health advice to a patient, explaining a common misconception.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker, a male doctor, uses formal language and a declarative tone. 「{逆に}」 is employed
      to present a counter-intuitive truth, emphasizing that the result (harm to health) is the opposite
      of the generally perceived benefit of exercise. This is a common pattern in informative or advisory
      contexts where an unexpected outcome is highlighted.
  - english: Many believe that increasing taxes will boost the economy, but conversely, it could slow

      to fall cause things also exist.

          - '{一方 で} 消費 を 落ち込ま せる こと も ある。'
        english: On the other hand, it could slow consumption.
        hint: 「一方で」 introduces a contrasting but not necessarily opposite viewpoint. We're looking for
          a direct counter-argument.
    scene: An economist presenting a nuanced view during a lecture or a panel discussion.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
  - english: I was nervous that the presentation wouldn't go well, but on the contrary, it was highly
      praised.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 思っ た より 高く 評価 さ れ た。
        english: It was praised more than I thought.
        hint: 「思ったより」 means "more than I thought," indicating a pleasant surprise. We're looking for a
          word that means "on the contrary" or "the opposite happened."
    scene: A female student talking to a friend after a school presentation, expressing relief.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The female speaker expresses her initial worry with 「心配していたが」 and then contrasts it with the
      positive outcome using 「{逆に} 高く 評価された」. This shows 「逆に」 can introduce an unexpectedly good result,
      not just a negative one, in casual conversation among friends. It implies a sense of pleasant surprise
      at the opposite of her expectation.
  - english: Some people say cats are aloof, but on the contrary, they are quite affectionate if you understand

          - '{けど}、理解 すれ ば とても 愛情 深い 生き物 だ。'
        english: But if you understand them, they are very affectionate creatures.
        hint: 「けど」 is a simple conjunction meaning "but." We're looking for a stronger contrast that presents
          the opposite viewpoint.
    scene: A male cat owner passionately explaining their pet's nature to a skeptical friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The male speaker uses 「{逆に}」 to challenge a common misconception about cats, asserting the
      opposite truth. The construction 「と言われることがあるが」 sets up the common belief, and 「{逆に}」 introduces
      the counterpoint, showcasing a passionate, personal opinion in a friendly setting. This usage emphasizes
      a direct contradiction to a widely held belief.
  - english: The new policy was expected to streamline procedures, but conversely, it complicated them
      further.
    japanese:
      - 新しい 方針 は 手続き を 簡素 化 する と 期待 さ れ た が、{逆 に} それ を さらに 複雑 に し て しまっ た。
      - 新しい 方針 は 手続き を 簡素 化 する と 期待 さ れ まし た が、{逆 に} それ を さらに 複雑 に し て しまい まし た。

        english: Nevertheless, it complicated them further.
        hint: 「にもかかわらず」 means "nevertheless" or "in spite of that." We're looking for an expression that
          indicates the outcome was the opposite of what was intended.
    scene: A government official reviewing the unintended consequences of a policy in a report or internal
      meeting.

  - english: 'A: You think that company''s sales are good this quarter? B: On the contrary, their profits

      - A:あの 会社 の 今期 の 売上 は いい と 思い ます か？B:{逆 に}、利益 は 大幅 に 下がっ て い ます よ。
    english_literally: 'A: That company''s this quarter''s sales good think? B: Conversely, profits significantly
      have dropped.'
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{それ どころ か}、利益 は 大幅 に 下がっ て いる よ。'
        english: Far from it, their profits have actually dropped significantly.
        hint: 「それどころか」 expresses a stronger contradiction, implying not just the opposite, but something
          even worse or more extreme. We're looking for a more neutral 'on the contrary'.
    scene: Two business colleagues discussing a company's performance.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Speaker B uses 「{逆に}」 to directly contradict Speaker A's assumption about sales, highlighting
      the true, opposite reality of profits. This demonstrates 「逆に」 being used to correct a misconception
      with factual information in a professional setting. The phrase 「利益は大幅に下がっている」 clearly states the
      contrary fact.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the core meaning of 「逆に」 as 'the reverse' or 'the opposite' allows
  you to apply it broadly, whether the outcome is positive, negative, or simply an alternative perspective.
  Pay attention to the context, especially the preceding statement, to grasp the exact nuance of the contrast
  being drawn. In casual conversation, its use can be quite flexible, even extending to social cues like
  turning a question around, which highlights its role in managing conversational flow as much as expressing
  semantic opposition.
