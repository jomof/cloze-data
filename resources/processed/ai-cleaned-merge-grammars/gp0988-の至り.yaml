        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used in very stiff, formal contexts, often in speeches, writing, or when expressing profound emotions to superiors.",
        "function": "Emphasizes the highest degree or peak of a specific emotion or state.",
        "nuance": "Conveys that the preceding noun (an emotion or state) has reached its absolute maximum. It's highly formal and often carries a sense of profoundness, whether positive (honor, gratitude) or negative (shame, embarrassment). While often positive, it can also be used for negative feelings.",
        "source": "Bunpro"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「の至り」 (no itari) originates from the noun 「至り」 (itari), which means 'climax,' 'pinnacle,' or 'utmost point.' The particle 「の」 (no) serves to connect the preceding noun, typically an emotion or state, to 「至り」, thereby indicating that the noun represents the highest or most extreme degree of that particular feeling or situation. It's a classical expression that highlights a peak state, often used in formal and literary contexts.",
    "writeup": "「の至り」 is a deeply formal and somewhat classical expression used to convey that a certain feeling or state has reached its absolute peak or utmost level. It's a combination of the particle 「の」 and the noun 「至り」, meaning 'pinnacle' or 'climax.' This structure is typically appended to nouns that represent emotions or states which can be experienced in varying degrees, such as honor (光栄), gratitude (感謝), embarrassment (赤面), or a sense of deep obligation (恐縮). While it can be used for both positive and negative emotions, it always emphasizes the extreme intensity of that feeling. It is particularly common in speeches, formal writing, and situations where a heightened sense of formality and reverence is required. A notable fixed expression using this grammar point is 「若気 の 至り」 (wakage no itari), which refers to a blunder or ill-considered action committed due to youthful impulsiveness or immaturity.",

            "meaning": "Utmost, extreme, height of, ultimate.",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「の極み」 is very similar to 「の至り」 and often interchangeable. However, 「の至り」 tends to be more associated with profound emotions like gratitude, honor, or embarrassment, especially in highly formal or ceremonial contexts. 「の極み」 can be used more broadly, not just for emotions but also to describe the ultimate state of something, like 'the height of beauty' (美 の 極み) or 'the ultimate in luxury' (贅沢 の 極み)."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「の至り」 and 「の極み」 convey an 'utmost' or 'extreme' degree, remember that 「の至り」 is particularly suited for expressing profound emotional states in very formal settings. Think of it when expressing deep gratitude, honor, or regret. 「の極み」 has a broader application and can describe the peak of qualities or conditions beyond just emotions.",

                    "hint": "「とても 光栄 です」 is a common polite expression, but it does not convey the absolute peak or 'utmost' feeling as strongly as 「の至り」. We are looking for a phrase to emphasize the maximum degree of honor."

                    "hint": "「大変 光栄 に 存じ ます」 uses humble language, but it still lacks the profound 'utmost' quality that 「の至り」 provides in very formal settings. We are looking for a phrase to emphasize the peak of the feeling."

                    "hint": "「恐縮 です」 expresses being apologetic or obliged, but it does not convey the profound, utmost sense of obligation and gratitude as 「の至り」. We are looking for an expression that emphasizes the highest degree of obligation."

The use of 「賜り」, a humble verb for receiving, and 「存じ ます」, a humble equivalent of 'to think/feel', reinforces the kenjōgo (humble language) register, often employed by younger individuals addressing older, respected figures."
