    "jlpt": "N1",
    "meaning": "Utmost, height of, extreme, deepest, completely.",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used in very stiff, formal contexts, often in speeches, writing, or when expressing profound emotions to superiors.",
        "function": "Emphasizes the highest degree or peak of a specific emotion or state.",
        "nuance": "Conveys that the preceding noun (an emotion or state) has reached its absolute maximum. It's highly formal and often carries a sense of profoundness, whether positive (honor, gratitude) or negative (shame, embarrassment). While often positive, it can also be used for negative feelings.",
        "source": "Bunpro"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「の至り」 (no itari) originates from the noun 「至り」 (itari), which means 'climax,' 'pinnacle,' or 'utmost point.' The particle 「の」 (no) serves to connect the preceding noun, typically an emotion or state, to 「至り」, thereby indicating that the noun represents the highest or most extreme degree of that particular feeling or situation. It's a classical expression that highlights a peak state, often used in formal and literary contexts.",
    "writeup": "「の至り」 is a deeply formal and somewhat classical expression used to convey that a certain feeling or state has reached its absolute peak or utmost level. It's a combination of the particle 「の」 and the noun 「至り」, meaning 'pinnacle' or 'climax.' This structure is typically appended to nouns that represent emotions or states which can be experienced in varying degrees, such as honor (光栄), gratitude (感謝), embarrassment (赤面), or a sense of deep obligation (恐縮). While it can be used for both positive and negative emotions, it always emphasizes the extreme intensity of that feeling. It is particularly common in speeches, formal writing, and situations where a heightened sense of formality and reverence is required. A notable fixed expression using this grammar point is 「若気の至り」 (wakage no itari), which refers to a blunder or ill-considered action committed due to youthful impulsiveness or immaturity.",

            "english": "It is the utmost honor to be invited to such a grand ceremony.",
            "english_literally": "To be invited to such a grand ceremony is the height of honor.",
            "scene": "A distinguished guest delivering an opening speech at a formal event.",

                    "competing_grammar": "とても 光栄 です",
                    "mitigation": "The scene's formal setting and the speaker's role as a distinguished guest suggest a need for a more profound and formal expression of honor than a simple 'very honored'."
                },
                {
                    "competing_grammar": "大変 光栄 に 存じ ます",
                    "mitigation": "While polite, '大変光栄に存じます' does not convey the same absolute peak or 'utmost' feeling as 'の至り' which is appropriate for a ceremonial speech."

            "speaker_gender": "male",
            "listener_gender": "group",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「光栄 の 至り」 is a highly formal expression of honor, often used in public addresses like speeches. The use of 「ござい ます」 further elevates the formality, indicating respect to a group of listeners."

        {
            "japanese": "私 の 未熟 な 点 に も かかわら ず 、 ご 丁寧 な ご 指導 を 賜り 、 {恐縮 の 至り} に 存じ ます 。",

                    "competing_grammar": "恐縮 です",
                    "mitigation": "The scenario emphasizes 'profound' gratitude and the researcher's 'deep' indebtedness, suggesting a stronger, more emphatic expression than a simple 'I am sorry/obliged'."
                },
                {
                    "competing_grammar": "大変 恐縮 し て おり ます",
                    "mitigation": "While polite, '大変恐縮しております' would not capture the full extent of the humble and obligated feeling required in expressing such deep appreciation for guidance despite one's own perceived shortcomings."

            "speaker_age": "younger",
            "nuance": "「恐縮 の 至り」 is used here to convey a deep sense of humble gratitude and obligation, typical when a subordinate is receiving invaluable help from a superior despite their own imperfections. The use of 「賜り」 (tamawari), a humble verb for receiving, and 「存じ ます」 (zonjimasu), a humble equivalent of 'to think/feel', reinforces the kenjōgo (humble language) register, often employed by younger individuals addressing older, respected figures."

                    "competing_grammar": "大変 恥ずかしく 思い ます",
                    "mitigation": "While formal, '大変恥ずかしく思います' is a statement of personal feeling. '赤面 の 至り' conveys that the situation itself *is* the peak of embarrassment, making it more impactful for a public confession."

            "speaker_gender": "male",
            "speaker_age": "older",
            "etymology": "The specific phrase 「赤面 の 至り」 directly refers to the act of one's face turning red due to shame or embarrassment, signifying a peak emotional state. 「赤面」 (sekimen) literally means 'red face', and its pairing with 「の至り」 emphasizes the extreme physiological manifestation of embarrassment."

                    "competing_grammar": "若さ から 来る もの でし た",
                    "mitigation": "This phrase is too neutral. '若気 の 至り' carries the implicit judgment that the action was ill-advised due to lack of experience, which fits the 'unplanned actions' and 'regrettable' context."

            "nuance": "「若気 の 至り」 (wakage no itari) is a fixed expression used to refer to impetuous or foolish actions done in one's youth. It often implies a sense of retrospect and mild regret or amusement over past immaturity. The casual register here fits the conversational tone when reminiscing with a friend."

However, 「の至り」 tends to be more associated with profound emotions like gratitude, honor, or embarrassment, especially in highly formal or ceremonial contexts. 「の極み」 can be used more broadly, not just for emotions but also to describe the ultimate state of something, like 'the height of beauty' (美の極み) or 'the ultimate in luxury' (贅沢の極み)."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「の至り」 and 「の極み」 convey an 'utmost' or 'extreme' degree, remember that 「の至り」 is particularly suited for expressing profound emotional states in very formal settings. Think of it when expressing deep gratitude, honor, or regret. 「の極み」 has a broader application and can describe the peak of qualities or conditions beyond just emotions.",
