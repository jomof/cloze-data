jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  function: Indicates the beginning of some process or the continuation of an action up to the present
    time.
  grammatical-role: Auxiliary Verb
etymology: The auxiliary verb 「くる」 is derived from the verb 「来る」 (kuru), meaning "to come." Over time,
  it evolved to express not just physical movement but also the commencement or continuation of actions
  and states, often with a sense of the action or state progressing towards the speaker's current position
  or the present moment in time.
writeup: |-
  The auxiliary verb 「くる」 (kuru) is used after the te-form of a verb (Vて) to indicate that something has begun to happen or has continued up to the present. There are two main usages:

  *   **Inceptive**: Indicates the beginning of a change or process. For example, 「雨 が 降っ て {き た}」 (ame ga futte {kita}) means "it started to rain."
  *   **Continuative**: Indicates the continuation of an action or state from the past to the present. For example, 「ず っと 勉強 し て {き た}」 (zutto benkyou shite {kita}) means "I have been studying all along."

  It's important to distinguish between the inceptive and continuative usages based on the context of the sentence. The choice of verb will greatly affect this nuance. This grammar point often implies that the action or change is progressing *towards* the speaker or their present reality, or has accumulated up to the present point. This gives it a sense of 'arrival' or a cumulative effect.
false_friends:
  - term: ～ていく (to continue doing)
    meaning: To go; to continue from now on
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「～てくる」, 「～ていく」 indicates a change or action that continues from the present into the
      future.
    grammar_point: ～ていく (to continue doing)
  - term: はじめる (to start doing)
    meaning: To begin
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「～てくる」 and 「はじめる」 can express the beginning of something, 「はじめる」 simply indicates
      the start of an action or state without necessarily implying continuity or a gradual development,
      whereas 「～てくる」 often implies a gradual change or continuation as it progresses toward the present.
    grammar_point: はじめる (to start doing)
  - term: ようになる (to come to be)
    meaning: To reach the point that, To come to be that, To turn into
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「～てくる」 and 「ようになる」 describe changes, 「～てくる」 emphasizes the process of something
      developing and **arriving** at the present state or towards the speaker. In contrast, 「ようになる」 focuses
      more on the **resultant state** of becoming able to do something, acquiring a habit, or reaching
      a new condition.
    grammar_point: ようになる (to come to be)
  - term: だす (to suddenly begin)
    meaning: To suddenly begin; to start doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「～てくる」 (in its inceptive sense) and 「～だす」 indicate the beginning of an action,
      「～だす」 emphasizes a sudden or abrupt start, often from a state of inactivity. 「～てくる」 can describe
      a more gradual or observable onset of a process that 'comes' into being.
    grammar_point: だす (to suddenly begin)
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse 「～てくる」 with 「～ていく」. While both express a change
  or process, 「～てくる」 looks at the change from the perspective of something approaching or starting from
  the past to the present. 「～ていく」, on the other hand, views the change as something moving away from the
  present into the future. Also, be careful not to confuse it with 「はじめる」 or 「～だす」, both of which mean
  "to start." While 「はじめる」 simply indicates the start of an action or state, and 「～だす」 emphasizes a sudden
  or abrupt start, 「～てくる」 focuses on the process that has begun and continues towards the present, or
  has culminated in the present. Lastly, while 「～てくる」 and 「ようになる」 both indicate a change, 「～てくる」 highlights
  the process of the change *arriving* at the present, often implying a gradual unfolding. 「ようになる」, however,
  signifies the *attainment* of a new state, ability, or habit.

          movement towards the speaker or up to the present. We're looking for the dog coming towards
          the speaker.
    scene: A heartwarming scene where a pet eagerly greets its owner.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「走っ て {き た}」 directly uses 「くる」 to indicate physical movement towards the speaker's location,
      emphasizing the dog's approach and its 'arrival' at the speaker's side. The casual tone is appropriate
      for describing a pet's action.

      as it unfolds and 'arrives' within the observer's present perception. The plain form implies a personal

      to be, or approached the speaker's current situation.

          even more things.

      that has 'come' along with the speaker to the present moment, resulting in their current understanding.

          that the release has not yet 'arrived' from its expected development.
    scene: Two friends discussing a highly anticipated video game that keeps getting delayed.
    register: casual

      despite external attempts.

    scene: A futurist discussing the potential positive impacts of technological advancements.

      that 'comes' to pass) leads to increased convenience. The 「～くれば」 form implies that *if* this process
      of spreading *comes to pass* and 'arrives' at a certain stage, then the result will follow. This
      is appropriate for a formal, explanatory context. 「くれ ば」 here highlights the condition where the

          has 'arrived' to be noticeable now.
    scene: Discussing urban changes with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「増え て {き た}」 highlights a growing trend or change that has been developing and is now apparent,
      "coming to be" this way. The casual register fits a conversation among friends. The use of 「きた」
      specifically points to this trend having developed and 'arrived' at the current noticeable state.
post_example_writeup: When using 「くる」 to indicate a change, remember that the verb before 「くる」 should
  reflect the state that is being changed *to*. For example, if you want to say "It's starting to get
  cold," you should use 「寒く」 (samuku), the adverbial form of 「寒い」 (samui), before 「なる」 to get 「寒く なっ て
  {き た}」 (samuku natte {kita}). The nuance of 「てくる」 often emphasizes that the change or action progresses
  towards the speaker's current time, place, or understanding, creating a sense of 'arrival' or accumulation.
