etymology: 'The `〜たら` form is generally considered to be a contraction or evolution of the past tense
  `〜た` (the 連用形 or continuative form) followed by the old conditional particle `ば` (as in `〜たならば`). Over
  time, `ならば` often reduced to `なら`, and in this specific construction, the `な` disappeared, leaving `たら`.
  This origin from the past tense `た` is key to understanding its primary function: the condition must
  be ''completed'' or ''realized'' for the consequence to follow, whether in a real or hypothetical sense.
  This inherent ''completion'' aspect differentiates it from other conditional forms which don''t carry
  this nuance.'
writeup: |-
  The `〜たら` conditional form is one of the most frequently used and versatile conditional structures in Japanese. It is formed by attaching `ら` to the `た` form of verbs, the `かった` form of い-adjectives, the `だった` form of な-adjectives, and the `だった` form of nouns.

  Its core meaning is "if/when A, then B." What sets `〜たら` apart is its strong implication that the action or state described in the first clause (A) must be completed or realized before the action or state in the second clause (B) can occur. This makes it particularly suitable for expressing sequential actions, definite results, or hypothetical situations where the fulfillment of the condition is paramount.

  `〜たら` can convey a simple hypothetical condition: 「もし明日雨が降ったら、家にいます。」("If it rains tomorrow, I'll stay home."). It can also express a sequence of events, where the completion of the first action directly leads to the second: 「家に帰ったら、ご飯を食べます。」("When I get home, I'll eat."). This sequential usage is very common.

  Another significant use is for expressing unexpected discoveries or findings. For example, after trying something, you might exclaim, 「使ってみたら、意外と便利だった！」("When I tried using it, it was surprisingly convenient!"). Here, the act of trying (`使ってみる`) is completed, leading to the discovery.

  Unlike `〜ば` or `〜と`, `〜たら` does not have strict limitations regarding the nature of the second clause (B). The result can be a command, a request, a suggestion, a statement of fact, or an intention. This flexibility makes it a very practical and all-purpose conditional form in daily conversation.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[ば] (conditional)
    meaning: if... then...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express conditions, `〜ば` often suggests a more general or hypothetical condition,
      or a logical consequence. Its use in the second clause is more restricted; it cannot be followed
      by volitional, imperative, or strong request forms. `〜たら` implies the completion or realization
      of the condition.
    grammar_point: Verb[えば] (conditional)
  - term: なら (conditional)
    meaning: if it's the case that A; as for A...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`〜なら` typically focuses on the speaker''s judgment or a specific piece of information. It
      introduces a condition that is often presumed to be true or is stated by someone else, and the second
      clause provides advice, a suggestion, or a consequence based on that presumption. It doesn''t imply
      temporal sequence like `〜たら` often does.'
    grammar_point: なら (conditional, if it's the case that A)
  - term: と (conditional, inevitable result)
    meaning: when A, then B (always); if A, then B (always)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`〜と` indicates an automatic, inevitable, or natural consequence. If A happens, B *always*
      happens. It''s often used for natural phenomena, mechanisms, or habits. `〜たら` is more flexible and
      does not imply this strict, automatic relationship.'
    grammar_point: と (conditional, inevitable result)
  - term: 〜とき (when)
    meaning: when... (time)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`〜とき` functions as a noun, specifying a time when an action or state occurs. It simply indicates
      the timeframe. `〜たら` explicitly expresses a condition or a sequential relationship where the first
      clause must be completed before the second. While both can translate to ''when,'' `〜たら` implies
      a condition *leading to* something, whereas `〜とき` just indicates the *moment* of something.'
    grammar_point: とき (when)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the subtle differences between these conditional forms is crucial.
  While `〜たら` is the most flexible, each conditional particle (`ば`, `なら`, `と`) carries its own specific
  nuance and grammatical constraints that make it suitable for different contexts. Practice using them
  in various situations to develop an intuitive sense of their appropriate usage.

      interaction. The `〜たら` conditional combined with `危ない` (abunai - dangerous) makes it a direct and
      immediate warning about a specific potential action.

        hint: Both are possible. `〜たら` is often used for hypothetical situations that, if realized, would
          lead to a significant outcome. `〜ならば` (a more formal version of `〜なら`) states a condition based
          on a presumption.
    scene: Two people discussing a fantastic but possibly untrue story.
    register: casual
