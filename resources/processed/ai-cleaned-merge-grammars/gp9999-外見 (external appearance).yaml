meaning: external appearance
pronunciation:
  katakana: ガイケン
  romaji: gaiken
formation:
  Noun + 外見: Refers to the external appearance of a noun.
  外見 + は + Adjective + だ / です: Describes the outward appearance with an adjective.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The word 外見 (gaiken) combines 外 (gai), meaning 'outside' or 'external,' and 見 (ken), which
  means 'to see' or 'appearance.' This etymology directly points to its meaning as 'what is seen from
  the outside,' reflecting its focus on outward presentation.
writeup: 外見 (がいけん) refers to the outward or external appearance of a person, object, or situation. It
  emphasizes what can be seen from the outside, often in contrast to inner qualities, essence, or true
  nature. While it can be used neutrally, it frequently carries a nuance of superficiality, implying that
  the true value or character might lie beyond what is immediately visible. It is a common term used in
  various contexts, from describing a person's physical looks to the facade of a building or the superficial
  aspect of an issue.

  - term: 見た目
    meaning: appearance, looks (often specifically a person's or object's visual appearance)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 見た目 tends to focus more on the visual impression or 'looks' of something or someone, often
      in a more straightforward, less abstract way than 外見. It is very common in casual conversation,
      whereas 外見 can be more formal or encompass a broader 'external aspect'.
    grammar_point: 見た目 (appearance)
  - term: 見かけ
    meaning: outward appearance, looks, facade
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 見かけ is very similar to 見た目 but often carries a stronger nuance of superficiality or potential
      deception, suggesting that the 'outward appearance' might be misleading. It is frequently used in
      phrases like 見かけ倒し (mikake-daoshi - looks can be deceiving).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:見かけ (outward appearance)
  - term: 姿
    meaning: figure, form, shape, appearance (of a person or object in motion or at rest)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 姿 refers more to the physical form or figure of something or someone, including their posture,
      silhouette, or how they present themselves in a broader sense. It often has an artistic or appreciative
      connotation, less about just the visual attributes. 外見 is more about the overall 'outward look'.
    grammar_point: 姿 (figure・appearance)
post_false_friends_writeup: The terms 外見, 見た目, and 見かけ all relate to appearance but subtly differ in nuance.
  While 外見 broadly covers 'external appearance,' 見た目 often refers to the visual impression or 'looks.'
  見かけ, on the other hand, frequently implies a facade or an appearance that might be misleading, highlighting
  the gap between what is seen and what is true. 姿, in contrast, emphasizes the physical form or figure,
  often with an aesthetic appreciation.
