        "nuance": "Emphasizes that an action is at the very point of commencing. It conveys a sense of being right at the threshold of something happening."

    "etymology": "「ところ」 comes from the verb 「とまる」 (to stop), and originally referred to a place where one stops or resides. Over time, its meaning expanded to include situations, stages, and moments in time. In this grammar point, 「ところ」 refers to a specific point in the progression of an action, specifically, the point immediately before it begins.",
    "writeup": "The noun 「ところ」 (sometimes shortened to 「とこ」) is often used to describe the \"place\" or \"situation\" in which something happens. The primary determining factor for the nuance of 「ところ」 is the tense of the verb it follows. When used with a verb in its dictionary (non-past) form, as in 「Vる + ところだ」, it expresses that an action is \"about to\" or \"on the verge of\" happening.\n\nWhile 「ところ」 itself can refer to a physical location, in this grammatical construction, it denotes a specific *moment* or *state* in the progression of an action. For instance, 「今から出かけるところだ」 means \"I am about to go out now,\" indicating the precise moment just before leaving.\n\nWhen the kanji form of 「所」 is used, it often refers to an actual physical location rather than a situation or standpoint. However, even with the kanji, in contexts like this grammar point, it can still convey the sense of a \"point in time\" or \"situation.\" Both the kanji form and the hiragana form (「ところ」) are relatively common in this usage.",
