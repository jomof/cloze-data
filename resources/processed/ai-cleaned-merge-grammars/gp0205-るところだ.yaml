    "etymology": "The phrase 「ところ」 means 'place' or 'situation.' When used with a verb in the dictionary form (「る」), it describes the state of being just about to do something. 「だ」 is the plain form of the copula.",
    "writeup": "The noun 「ところ」 (sometimes shortened to 「とこ」) is often used to describe the \"place\" or \"situation\" in which something happens. The primary determining factor for the nuance of 「ところ」 is the tense of the verb it follows. When it is in the non-past form, 「るところだ」 means \"about to (A),\" or \"on the verge of (A).\" \n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   When the kanji form of 「所」 is used, it often refers to an actual physical location rather than a situation/standpoint. However, this is something that native speakers will sometimes mistake. Therefore, seeing the kanji form and the hiragana form are both relatively common.\n*   Pay attention to the tense of the verb preceding 「ところ」, as it significantly alters the meaning. For example, 「たところだ」 means \"just finished doing.\"",
