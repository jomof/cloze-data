meaning: A noun modified by a preceding verb stem, indicating its purpose, characteristic, or association
  with the verb's action.
pronunciation:
  katakana: レンヨウケイ メイシ
  romaji: ren'youkei meishi
formation:
  Verb-stem + Noun: The verb stem (連用形) directly precedes a noun, forming a compound noun where the verb
    describes or specifies the noun's function or nature. For example, 読み物 (reading material), 飲み物 (drink),
    遊び場 (playground), 休憩所 (resting place).
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  function: Forms compound nouns by indicating the noun's purpose, characteristic, or association with
    the verb's action.
  nuance: Often implies a functional relationship or a generic category. The verb stem acts almost like
    an adjective, but it is derived directly from a verb's action.
  grammatical-role: The resulting phrase functions as a noun.
etymology: This grammatical pattern is deeply rooted in the historical development of the Japanese language.
  The verb stem (連用形, ren'youkei), originally functioning as a connective form, naturally evolved to combine
  directly with nouns, creating compound words. This process is a fundamental aspect of nominalization
  in Japanese, where the action or state described by the verb is directly applied to define the noun,
  effectively creating a new lexical item or a specific type of noun.
writeup: The [Verb-stem]Noun construction is a fundamental pattern in Japanese for creating compound nouns.
  It involves taking the stem form of a verb, known as the 連用形 (ren'youkei), and directly attaching it
  to a noun. This combination forms a new noun where the verb stem modifies the following noun, indicating
  its purpose, characteristic, or direct association with the action described by the verb. This is a
  highly productive way to create specific, often lexicalized, compound nouns. For example, 読む (yomu,
  to read) + 物 (mono, thing) becomes 読み物 (yomimono, reading material), literally 'thing for reading'.
  Similarly, 飲む (nomu, to drink) + 物 (mono, thing) forms 飲み物 (nomimono, a drink). This pattern often signifies
  a designated object, place, or person related to the verb's action. It differs from other nominalization
  methods like [Verb-dictionary]こと (the act of doing), which provides a more abstract or generalized nominalization
  of the verb itself. [Verb-stem]Noun often results in a more concrete and specialized term.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[dictionary]こと (the act of・the fact that)
    meaning: The act of doing, the fact that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '[Verb-stem]Noun creates a lexicalized compound noun, often referring to a specific item or
      place, while Verb[dictionary]こと nominalizes the verb into an abstract concept or general action.'
    grammar_point: '[Clause]こと (the act of・the fact that)'
  - term: かた (way of doing)
    meaning: How to do, way of doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '[Verb-stem]Noun indicates the purpose or characteristic of the noun related to the verb,
      whereas かた specifically refers to the method or manner of performing an action.'
    grammar_point: かた (way of doing)
  - term: Verb[stem] (conjunction)
    meaning: Verb stem as a conjunction (e.g., to continue, to be).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Although both use the verb stem, [Verb-stem]Noun forms a compound noun. Verb[stem] (conjunction)
      connects clauses or verbs, indicating a sequence or continuous action, and does not form a noun
      itself.
    grammar_point: Verb[stem] (conjunction)
post_false_friends_writeup: The [Verb-stem]Noun construction forms a specific type of compound noun, often
  denoting an item or place whose function is described by the verb. This contrasts with [Verb-dictionary]こと,
  which provides a general meaning of an action, and かた, which specifies the method of doing something.
  For instance, 読み物 (reading material) refers to the item, 読むこと (the act of reading) refers to the action
  itself, and 読み方 (how to read) refers to the method. The Verb[stem] (conjunction) uses the same verb
  stem form, but its grammatical role is to link verbs or clauses, not to form a compound noun.
