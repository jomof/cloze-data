    "etymology": "「次第 (shidai)」 originally means 'order' or 'sequence.' In this grammar point, it carries the nuance of 'depending on the order of things' or 'depending on the circumstances.' 「だ」 and 「で」 are copulas, with 「だ」 marking a statement and 「で」 indicating a condition or reason.",
    "writeup": "The noun 「次第 (shidai)」, meaning \"order\" or \"sequence,\" functions similarly to a suffix when used directly after another noun. It's typically followed by 「だ」 or 「で」 and a subsequent statement (B). In this usage, 「次第だ・次第で」 translates to \"depending on (A), (B)\" or \"(B) depends on (A).\" The preceding noun (A) usually highlights a person or a specific situation that influences the outcome. Essentially, 「次第」 expresses a sequence of events or determining factors and the resulting consequences. This concept is also seen in other grammar patterns like 「次第」 meaning \"as soon as,\" and 「次第です」 meaning \"due to that\" or \"as a result of that.\"",
