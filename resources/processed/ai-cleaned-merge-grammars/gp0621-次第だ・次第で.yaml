    "etymology": "「次第 (shidai)」 originally means \"order,\" \"sequence,\" or \"circumstances.\" The grammar point retains the nuance that the outcome or subsequent action is determined by a preceding factor or condition. It indicates a direct relationship between one thing and another, where the former dictates the latter.",
    "writeup": "「次第だ」 and 「次第で」 are expressions indicating that something depends on a preceding noun. 「次第だ」 is used at the end of a sentence, while 「次第で」 connects to another clause to specify the condition upon which the subsequent action or state depends. The core nuance is that the outcome or a specific situation is **directly influenced or determined** by the preceding noun. This pattern is frequently employed to emphasize that a particular factor, often a person or a specific circumstance, holds the key to what happens next. It expresses a direct dependency, where the initial element dictates the result. This grammatical construction is quite versatile, appearing in contexts related to conditions, decisions, and outcomes.",
