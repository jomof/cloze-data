    "writeup": "「次第だ」 and 「次第で」 are expressions indicating that something depends on a preceding noun. 「次第だ」 is used at the end of a sentence, while 「次第で」 connects to another clause to specify the condition upon which the subsequent action or state depends. The core nuance is that the outcome or a specific situation is **directly influenced or determined** by the preceding noun. This pattern is frequently employed to emphasize that a particular factor, often a person or a specific circumstance, holds the key to what happens next. It expresses a direct dependency, where the initial element dictates the result.\n\nIn all its nuances, 「次第」 fundamentally expresses a sequence of events or deciding factors, and what either will or has happened due to that. This link can be seen in other grammar patterns like 「次第」 meaning \"as soon as,\" and 「次第です」 used in the sense of \"due to that\" or \"as a result of that.\"",
