        "Function": "Presents typical examples of actions, events, situations, people, or things among a number of possibilities.",

    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「Noun+も+Verb[ば-conditional]+Noun+も+Verb」, is used to express that something happens sometimes, and something else also happens sometimes. It presents typical examples, not necessarily frequent occurrences. It's often found in formal writing and speech. Essentially, it means \"sometimes... and sometimes...\" or \"there are times when... and times when...\".\n\n*   The conditional 「ば」 form (ba-conditional) of the verb is crucial here.\n*   The pattern is 「Noun + も + Verb (ば-form) + Noun + も + Verb」.\n*   This structure does **not** imply frequency, just that both scenarios occur at some point.",
    "etymology": "The 「も」 particle here emphasizes the two possibilities being presented. 「ば」 is the conditional form of the verb, indicating 'if' or 'when' something happens.",
