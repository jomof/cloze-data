        "source": "DOJG (Dictionary of Japanese Grammar)",

        "temporal-flow": "Suggests an alternating or concurrent temporal flow where different states or events occur at different times or simultaneously, showing variability over time."
    },
    "etymology": "The structure combines the particle 「も」 (also, even) with the conditional 「ば」 form of a verb, which denotes a condition or cause. The repetition of 「も」 highlights that both listed possibilities or states are equally valid or occur within a given context. The phrase essentially asserts the existence or occurrence of 'this' (V1) and 'that' (V2), implying a variability or range of states or actions. Historically, the conditional 'ば' form evolved from 'は' combined with the indicative form, indicating a condition or consequence. The addition of 'も' before each clause emphasizes that each condition is equally viable or present.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Noun+も+Verb[ば-conditional]+Noun+も+Verb」, more broadly represented as 「〜も Vば 〜も V」, is used to express that there are times when one thing happens, and other times when something else happens. This structure effectively presents a range of possibilities, typical examples, or alternating situations.\n\nIt is commonly employed in formal writing and speech, including academic texts, business contexts, and general observations where a comprehensive and balanced perspective is desired. Unlike simply listing possibilities, this pattern emphasizes that both (or all) mentioned conditions or outcomes are part of the overall experience or phenomenon. It implies a sense of 'sometimes this, and sometimes that' or 'there exist both this and that' within a given scope.\n\nWhile the grammar point title specifically mentions 'Noun', the pattern is highly versatile and can apply to various linguistic elements preceding 「も」, including nominalized clauses, verb stems, and adjective forms, as detailed in the 'Formation' section. This flexibility allows for its application in diverse contexts to describe the fluctuating nature of events, characteristics, or states. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to highlight the duality or the full spectrum of a situation.",
