    "etymology": "The grammar point 限りだ combines the noun 「限り」 (kagiri), meaning 'limit' or 'extent,' with the copula 「だ」. The literal sense is that something has reached the limit or peak of a certain quality.",
    "writeup": "限りだ follows adjectives to express that something is \"extremely (A)\" or \"as (A) as can be.\" It's a combination of the noun 「限り」, meaning 'limit,' and the auxiliary verb 「だ」. Therefore, it literally means something is 'the limit of (A)', where (A) is a quality. 限りだ is quite formal and emphasizes the speaker's perception of the intensity of a trait. Often, the adjective used expresses the speaker's emotion rather than an objective quality. Examples include: 嬉しい (feeling of happiness), 頼もしい (feeling of reliability), 羨ましい (feeling of envy), 寂しい (feeling of loneliness), 恥ずかしい (feeling of embarrassment), and 心強い (feeling of reassurance). The intensity is subjective and depends on the speaker's individual feelings.",
