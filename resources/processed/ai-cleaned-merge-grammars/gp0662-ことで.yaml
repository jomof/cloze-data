        "nuance": "Emphasizes the action or state as the direct reason or method.",
        "colocation": "Attaches to the informal nonpast form of verbs and i-adjectives, the informal form of sentences, the stem of na-adjectives with な, and nouns with である.",
        "grammatical-role": "Connects a preceding action or state to a subsequent outcome or action, functioning as a causal or instrumental link.",
        "logical-flow": "Establishes a clear cause-and-effect or means-to-end relationship between two clauses."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことで」 combines 「こと」 (koto), which means 'thing' or 'event', with the particle 「で」 (de), which indicates means or cause. Therefore, literally it means 'by means of that thing/event' or 'because of that thing/event'. Its usage has evolved to abstractly refer to the circumstance or action leading to a result.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ことで」 serves two primary functions: indicating a **means or method** ('by doing X') or a **cause or reason** ('because X').\n\nWhen indicating a **means or method**, it typically attaches to the informal nonpast form of verbs (e.g., 行くことで). For example, 「毎日 運動 する {ことで} 、 健康 を 維持 しています」 (I maintain my health by exercising every day) uses 「することで」 to show the *method* of health maintenance.\n\nWhen indicating a **cause or reason**, it can attach to the informal nonpast or past forms of verbs and i-adjectives (e.g., 行ったことで、高いことで), or to the stem of な-adjectives followed by 「なこと」 (e.g., 便利なことで), or to nouns followed by 「であること」 (e.g., 女であることで).\n\nFor nouns, remember that the formal 「である」 is necessary, especially in written contexts. In everyday speech, using 「ことで」 directly after a noun without 「である」 might sound unnatural or incomplete. For instance, 「遅刻 した {ことで} 、 先生 に 怒られました」 (I was scolded by the teacher because I was late) illustrates the use of 「ことで」 to state the *reason* for being scolded.\n\nIt is a versatile expression applicable in various situations, but always consider the specific form required for verbs, adjectives, or nouns, and the nuance of direct means or cause it conveys.",

            "nuance": "「ため(に)」 can indicate either purpose ('for the sake of') or cause/reason ('because of'). When indicating cause, it often presents a more objective or formal reason than 「ことで」, which tends to link an action or state more directly to its result."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「ことで」 emphasizes the specific action or state that leads to a result. While other expressions like 「によって」, 「から」, 「ので」, or 「ため(に)」 can also indicate cause, 「ことで」 is more focused on the direct impact of that action. When expressing a simple, straightforward reason or origin, 「から」 or 「ので」 might be more appropriate. If the emphasis is on the agent or a more objective/formal cause, 「によって」 or 「ため(に)」 might be a better fit. 「ことで」 highlights the very act or state as the precise mechanism or reason for the outcome.",
