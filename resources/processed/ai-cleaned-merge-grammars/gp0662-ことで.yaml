        "Verb (informal nonpast) + ことで": "Indicates a means or method ('by doing').",
        "Sentence (informal) + ことで": "Indicates a cause or reason ('because').",

        "Function": "Indicates a reason, method, or cause.",
        "Form": "Attaches to the informal nonpast form of verbs and i-adjectives, the informal form of sentences, the stem of na-adjectives with な, and nouns with である.",

    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことで」 combines 「こと」 (koto), which means 'thing' or 'event', with the particle 「で」 (de), which indicates means or cause. Therefore, literally it means 'by means of that thing/event' or 'because of that thing/event'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ことで」 serves two primary functions: indicating a **means or method** ('by doing X') or a **cause or reason** ('because X').\n\nWhen indicating a **means or method**, it typically attaches to the informal nonpast form of verbs (e.g., 行くことで). For example, 「毎日運動することで、健康を維持しています」 (I maintain my health by exercising every day) uses 「することで」 to show the *method* of health maintenance.\n\nWhen indicating a **cause or reason**, it can attach to the informal nonpast or past forms of verbs and i-adjectives (e.g., 行ったことで、高いことで), or to the stem of な-adjectives followed by 「なこと」 (e.g., 便利なことで), or to nouns followed by 「であること」 (e.g., 女であることで).\n\nFor nouns, remember that the formal 「である」 is necessary, especially in written contexts. In everyday speech, using 「ことで」 directly after a noun without 「である」 might sound unnatural or incomplete. For instance, 「遅刻したことで、先生に怒られました」 (I was scolded by the teacher because I was late) illustrates the use of 「ことで」 to state the *reason* for being scolded.\n\nIt is a versatile expression applicable in various situations, but always consider the specific form required for verbs, adjectives, or nouns, and the nuance of direct means or cause it conveys.",
