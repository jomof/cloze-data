        "usage-context": "hard/stiff (i.e. formal, in writing, serious situations)",
        "function": "Expresses compliance with instructions or external influence.",
        "nuance": "Implies acting without resistance or personal initiative, simply following external directives. It often carries a connotation of passive obedience or adherence to an external force."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「Verb[れる・られる]ままに」 combines the passive auxiliary verb 「れる・られる」 (indicating being told or ordered or influenced) with 「ままに」, which means \"in the state of\" or \"as is\". Literally, it suggests doing something in the state of having been told or ordered or influenced.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 signifies performing an action exactly as one is told, ordered, or influenced. It is constructed by attaching the passive auxiliary verbs 「れる」 or 「られる」 to the verb stem, followed by 「ままに」. This construction highlights that the subject is acting in compliance with an external directive or influence, rather than their own initiative.\n\nThis pattern is primarily used with verbs that imply communication or instruction, such as 言う (to say), 命じる (to order), 聞く (to ask), 教える (to teach), 勧める (to recommend), 要求する (to demand), or 案内する (to guide). The sense conveyed is that the action (the part after 「ままに」) is carried out precisely \"in the state of having been told/ordered/guided\" (the part before 「ままに」).\n\nFor instance, if someone says 「言われるままに」, it means they are doing something **exactly as they were told**. The literal translation often approaches \"to do (B) in the state that (A) was done to me,\" where (A) is the instruction or influence received, and (B) is the subsequent action taken in compliance.\n\nWhile less common in modern Japanese, the conjunction particle が (ga) may occasionally appear between the passive form of the verb and 「ままに」 (e.g., 言われるがままに). In this context, が does not carry its typical \"but\" meaning. Instead, it emphasizes that the instruction (A) was not resisted or argued with when performing action (B). This grammatical structure is notably formal and less frequently encountered in casual conversation, appearing more often in written contexts or serious discussions.",

            "setting": "professional",
            "conjugation": "dictionary (plain non-past)",
            "nuance": "This sentence reflects a common scenario in a Japanese office environment where an employee complies with a superior's instruction. The use of 「課長に言われる」 (to be told by the section chief) clearly indicates a top-down directive, and 「ままに」 emphasizes precise adherence without personal discretion."

            "nuance": "This example uses the past passive form 「尋ねられた」 (was asked) to describe compliance under formal questioning. 「正直に」 (honestly) underlines that the disclosure was direct and complete, driven by the request."

            "nuance": "The use of the polite form 「言われます」 (is politely told) is appropriate when speaking about advice from a professional like a doctor. 「努力をしています」 (am making efforts) indicates an ongoing, conscious commitment to following the instructions, rather than a mere passive response."

            "conjugation": "dictionary (plain non-past)",
            "nuance": "This example demonstrates that 「ままに」 can be used in less formal contexts like recommendations among friends. 「勧められる」 (to be recommended) is a milder form of influence, where compliance is more out of trust or casual acceptance rather than strict obedience."

            "nuance": "Here, 「促される」 (to be prompted/encouraged) implies a gentle push rather than a strict command. The speaker's reluctance 「恥ずかしがりながらも」 (though shy) contrasts with their compliance, making the action of singing a result of their grandmother's influence rather than their own desire."

            "nuance": "This example showcases a more metaphorical use of 「ままに」, where the 'instruction' comes from an internal source (the voice of the heart). 「導かれる」 (to be led) implies following an inner calling, highlighting the grammar point's applicability beyond explicit commands to abstract influences."

            "conjugation": "negative past polite (～ませんでした)",
            "nuance": "The negative past polite form 「言われませんでした」 indicates a specific lack of instruction from a superior in the past. This absence of external directive led to the speaker's independent decision-making 「自分で判断して」, which may imply taking initiative or a necessary step when guidance was not provided."

It suggests adherence to a pre-established framework or guideline, implying that the action is *consistent with* something. In contrast, 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 denotes *direct compliance* with an instruction given to the speaker, implying a more active obedience rather than mere alignment."

While it shares the 'just like' aspect, it focuses on the *accuracy* of the replication. 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」, conversely, foregrounds the *compliance* or *obedience* aspect, specifically in response to being told or influenced by someone or something."

It often implies a goal or a comparison. 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」, however, is distinct in its specific focus on an action performed as a direct consequence of being told or influenced, with an emphasis on unresisting compliance rather than purpose or similarity."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 always implies doing something exactly as someone told you to do, or as an external influence guided you. It's about compliance and following orders or influences, not just acting in accordance with a general rule, policy, or for a specific purpose. Other similar expressions may focus on accuracy, purpose, or general adherence, but 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 is specifically about unresisting obedience to a received instruction or influence. It explicitly uses the passive voice to highlight this reception of influence.",
