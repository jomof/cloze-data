        "function": "Expresses compliance with instructions or external influence.",
        "nuance": "Implies acting without resistance or personal initiative, simply following external directives. It often carries a connotation of passive obedience or adherence to an external force."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「Verb[れる・られる]ままに」 combines the passive auxiliary verb 「れる・られる」 (indicating being told or ordered or influenced) with 「ままに」, which means \"in the state of\" or \"as is\". Literally, it suggests doing something in the state of having been told or ordered or influenced.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 signifies performing an action exactly as one is told, ordered, or influenced. It is constructed by attaching the passive auxiliary verbs 「れる」 or 「られる」 to the verb stem, followed by 「ままに」. This construction highlights that the subject is acting in compliance with an external directive or influence, rather than their own initiative.\n\nThis pattern is primarily used with verbs that imply communication or instruction, such as 言う (to say), 命じる (to order), 聞く (to ask), 教える (to teach), 勧める (to recommend), 要求する (to demand), or 案内する (to guide). The sense conveyed is that the action (the part after 「ままに」) is carried out precisely \"in the state of having been told/ordered/guided\" (the part before 「ままに」).\n\nFor instance, if someone says 「言われるままに」, it means they are doing something **exactly as they were told**. The literal translation often approaches \"to do (B) in the state that (A) was done to me,\" where (A) is the instruction or influence received, and (B) is the subsequent action taken in compliance.\n\nWhile less common in modern Japanese, the conjunction particle が (ga) may occasionally appear between the passive form of the verb and 「ままに」 (e.g., 言われるがままに). In this context, が does not carry its typical \"but\" meaning. Instead, it emphasizes that the instruction (A) was not resisted or argued with when performing action (B). This grammatical structure is notably formal and less frequently encountered in casual conversation, appearing more often in written contexts or serious discussions.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「Verb[れる・られる]」 forms the core of this grammar point, it is simply the passive or potential conjugation of a verb. 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 adds the crucial nuance of *doing something in compliance with* that passive action or state, emphasizing obedience or adherence to external influence."

            "nuance": "「ままに」 on its own expresses a state or condition remaining unchanged, or doing something exactly as something else happens (e.g., 思うままに 'as one thinks'). However, when preceded by a passive verb form as in 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」, it specifically denotes compliance with an external instruction or influence, a nuance not present when 「ままに」 is used alone."

            "nuance": "「にしたがって」 implies adherence to a general rule, a natural phenomenon, or a progression (e.g., 時間が経つにしたがって 'as time passes'). Unlike 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」, it does not emphasize direct compliance with a personal instruction or command, but rather following a broader guideline or development."

            "nuance": "「に沿って」 means to follow along a path, a plan, or a policy. It suggests adherence to a pre-established framework or guideline, implying that the action is *consistent with* something. In contrast, 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 denotes *direct compliance* with an instruction given to the speaker, implying a more active obedience rather than mere alignment."

            "nuance": "「とおり」 (often written as 通り) emphasizes the exactness or precision of an action in relation to something else (e.g., 計画通り 'as planned'). While it shares the 'just like' aspect, it focuses on the *accuracy* of the replication. 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」, conversely, foregrounds the *compliance* or *obedience* aspect, specifically in response to being told or influenced by someone or something."

            "nuance": "「ように」 serves multiple functions, including expressing purpose ('so that'), appearance ('like'), or a request ('please do'). It often implies a goal or a comparison. 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」, however, is distinct in its specific focus on an action performed as a direct consequence of being told or influenced, with an emphasis on unresisting compliance rather than purpose or similarity."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 always implies doing something exactly as someone told you to do, or as an external influence guided you. It's about compliance and following orders or influences, not just acting in accordance with a general rule, policy, or for a specific purpose. Other similar expressions may focus on accuracy, purpose, or general adherence, but 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 is specifically about unresisting obedience to a received instruction or influence. It explicitly uses the passive voice to highlight this reception of influence.",
