    "etymology": "The grammar point 「Verb[れる・られる]ままに」 combines the passive auxiliary verb 「れる・られる」 (indicating being told or ordered) with 「ままに」, which means \"in the state of\" or \"as is\". Literally, it suggests doing something in the state of having been told or ordered.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 indicates doing something exactly as one is told or ordered. It is a relatively formal expression. The 「れる・られる」 part indicates the passive voice, implying that the subject is acting in compliance with someone else's instructions or demands. This pattern is often used when the speaker wants to convey that they are simply following orders or instructions without necessarily taking initiative or responsibility. It is mostly used in fairly **formal situations** or in writing. This grammar point is not as commonly used in everyday conversation as other similar expressions.",
