    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とあっては」combines the particle 「と」, indicating content or condition, with the verb 「ある」 in its te-form 「あって」, and the topic particle 「は」. Literally, it means something like 「given that X exists」 or 「given that X is the case」.",
    "writeup": "「とあっては」 indicates that, given a certain situation, a particular outcome or feeling is natural or unavoidable. It's similar to saying \"given that...\" or \"because it's the case that...\". The nuance often suggests a sense of inevitability or strong justification. It is often used in formal or semi-formal contexts. The 「だ」 after な-adjectives and nouns is omitted.",
