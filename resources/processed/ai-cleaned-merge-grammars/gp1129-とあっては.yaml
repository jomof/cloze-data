        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "nuance": "This expression strongly emphasizes the preceding circumstance as the compelling reason for what follows, implying that the outcome is a natural, logical, or unavoidable consequence of that specific situation. It highlights the weight or significance of the given condition.",
        "colocation": "Often followed by expressions of inevitability or strong conviction, such as 「～わけにはいかない」, 「～しかない」, 「～のも当然だ」, 「～致し方ない」.",

        "temporal-flow": "The circumstance specified by 「とあっては」 is generally an existing or established fact that directly precedes and influences the consequence."
    },
    "etymology": "The 「と」 indicates a content or condition, 「あって」 is the te-form of the verb 「ある」 (to be), indicating existence or a state, and 「は」 is a topic marker. Together, they create a phrase that acknowledges a certain state or condition as a premise.",
    "writeup": "「{とあっては}」 is a grammar structure that sets up a specific, often undeniable, **circumstance or fact** as the **reason or condition** for a subsequent natural or unavoidable consequence. It implies a strong, logical connection where, given that particular situation, the resulting action or state is the only or expected outcome. This expression conveys a sense of **inevitability** or **strong implication** based on the preceding information. It is primarily used in **formal speech and writing**, lending a somewhat objective or declarative tone. It can be translated as \"given the circumstance that...\", \"if it is the case that...\", \"because...\", or \"since...\". **Important Considerations:** The condition described by 「{とあっては}」 is generally a concrete or accepted fact, not a hypothetical possibility. The phrase often precedes statements of obligation, necessity, or natural reaction.",
