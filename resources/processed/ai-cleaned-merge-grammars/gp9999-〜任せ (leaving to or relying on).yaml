jlpt: N2
etymology: The grammatical pattern 〜任せ derives from the verb 任せる (makaseru), which means 'to entrust,'
  'to leave to someone else,' or 'to leave to chance.' The nominalized form 任せ retains this core meaning
  but functions as a suffix, usually to a noun, to describe a state where an action, decision, or outcome
  is surrendered to or dependent on that preceding noun. This evolution from an active verb to a descriptive
  suffix highlights a shift from an active verb to the resulting condition of reliance or being at the
  mercy of something.
writeup: |-
  「〜任せ」 is a grammatical pattern that indicates an action, decision, or outcome is **left to**, **reliant upon**, or **at the mercy of** the preceding noun. It often conveys a sense of relinquishing control, whether due to choice, necessity, or a lack of foresight.

  This pattern is typically formed by attaching `任せ` to a noun. The noun describes the agent, factor, or circumstance to which something is being left. For example, `運任せ` means "leaving it to fate" or "at the mercy of luck." `人任せ` means "leaving things to others" or "relying on others."

  The nuance of `〜任せ` can vary:
  *   **Resignation/Fatalism**: When used with nouns like `運` (un, luck/fate) or `成り行き` (nariyuki, course of events), it often implies a sense of letting things unfold as they may, sometimes due to a lack of control or an inability to influence the outcome.
  *   **Delegation/Trust**: While less common than the verb `任せる` in this context, it can subtly suggest trusting something to a particular entity or force.
  *   **Irresponsibility/Lack of Planning**: With nouns like `気分` (kibun, mood) or `勢い` (ikioi, momentum/impetus), it can imply acting impulsively or without proper consideration, simply going with the flow.
  *   **Dependence**: It can describe a state where something is heavily dependent on a specific element, such as `客任せ` (kyaku-makase, customer-dependent).

  `〜任せ` is frequently encountered in compound nouns or fixed phrases. While `任せる` (the verb) is used for active entrusting, `〜任せ` (the nominalized phrase) describes a state or characteristic of being reliant on something. It's a versatile expression that highlights the passive acceptance or active delegation of control to an external factor.

  - term: 任せる
    meaning: to entrust, to leave to, to rely on (verb)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the active verb form. While `〜任せ` describes a characteristic or state of being left
      to an external factor, `任せる` is the action of actively entrusting. For instance, 「彼に{任せる}」 means
      'I will leave it to him,' whereas 「彼{任せ}の仕事」 describes 'work left entirely to him.'

  - term: 〜次第
    meaning: depending on, as soon as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While `〜任せ` conveys that something is *left to* or *at the mercy of* another, `〜次第` emphasizes
      *dependency* or *conditionality*. For example, 「結果{次第}」 (depending on the result) implies the result
      *determines* the next step. `次第` can also mean 'as soon as'.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Noun]次第 (depending on)
  - term: 〜に頼る
    meaning: to rely on, to depend on
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜任せ focuses on the *act or state of leaving something to* another, often with less personal
      involvement. 「〜に頼る」 implies a more active *reliance* or *dependence* on someone or something for
      support, help, or information. For instance, 「人{任せ}」 suggests one *lets others handle* things, possibly
      due to laziness, while 「人に{頼る}」 implies one *seeks help from* others.
    grammar_point: Verb[dictionary] (dictionary form)
  - term: 〜に委ねる
    meaning: to entrust, to commit, to surrender
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to `任せる`, but `〜に委ねる` often carries a stronger sense of surrendering control or entrusting
      something entirely, especially to a higher power, fate, or someone with greater authority. It can
      imply a more profound act of commitment or resignation than `任せる`. `〜任せ` describes the *state* of
      being left, while `〜に委ねる` is the *act* of entrusting, often with significant implications.
    grammar_point: Verb[dictionary] (dictionary form)
post_false_friends_writeup: While `〜任せ`, `任せる`, `〜次第`, `〜に頼る`, and `〜に委ねる` all share some semantic overlap
  in conveying reliance or delegation, their nuances are distinct. `任せる` is the active verb for entrusting.
  `〜任せ` (as a nominalized phrase) describes a state where an outcome or action is passively left to a
  specific factor, often highlighting a lack of personal control or a particular characteristic. `〜次第`
  emphasizes direct dependency and conditionality, meaning the outcome is determined by something. `〜に頼る`
  implies seeking support or help. `〜に委ねる` suggests a more complete surrender of control or deep trust
  in significant matters. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for precise expression in Japanese.

      control and they are simply leaving it to fate or chance. The phrase 「運任せ」 directly expresses this
      fatalistic approach. This is commonly used when there are no other options but to rely on external
      factors.

      capability is the primary factor. This can be either a neutral observation or carry a slight nuance
      of thoughtlessness, depending on context.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, the `〜任せ` pattern is versatile, describing situations
  where control is ceded to external factors, whether it's fate (`運任せ`), other people (`人任せ`), one's own
  impulses (`気分任せ`, `勢い任せ`), or even one's own physical abilities (`腕任せ`). It can convey resignation,
  irresponsibility, or simply a realistic acknowledgment of external influences. Pay attention to the
  noun preceding `任せ` to grasp the specific nuance in each context.
