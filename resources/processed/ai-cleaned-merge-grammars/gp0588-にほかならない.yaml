    "writeup": "「にほかならない」 is a formal expression that emphasizes a statement, reason, or cause. It conveys the idea that something is \"nothing but,\" \"none other than,\" or \"simply\" a particular thing. It's often used in formal writing and speech to add emphasis. Because of the 「〜ない」, it has a strong definitive tone. It asserts that there is no alternative explanation or possibility.",
