    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from combining the noun 他 (hoka, \"other\") with the negative form of the verb なる (naru, \"to become\"). Literally, it means \"it will not become anything other than this,\" implying that the stated fact is the only possible explanation or description.",
    "writeup": "**にほかならない** (ni hoka naranai) is a formal expression used to emphasize a statement, reason, or cause. It conveys that something is \"nothing but,\" \"none other than,\" or \"simply\" what is being stated. Because of its formality, it is often found in written Japanese or formal speeches. It indicates a definitive assertion. The nuance is similar to saying, \"it *is* what it *is*,\" leaving no room for alternative interpretations. In formal writing, you might encounter **に他ならぬ** (ni hoka naranu), which carries a similar meaning.",
