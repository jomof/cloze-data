jlpt: N3
etymology: The particle 「らしい」 originates from the classical Japanese form 「然し」 (shikashi), which meant
  “so, thus, like that.” Over time, it evolved from expressing mere resemblance (similar to 「～の如し」, 'no
  gotoshi') to conveying an appearance or inference based on observation or hearsay. The root sense of
  'being like something' expanded to 'appearing to be' or 'sounding like,' reflecting information gathered
  indirectly. This evolution highlights its function as a marker of perceived reality rather than absolute
  fact.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「らしい」 is used to express an inference or a statement based on what one has heard or observed, but without absolute certainty. It translates to "it seems," "I hear," "apparently," or "looks like." The speaker is not stating a fact directly, but rather conveying something they believe to be true based on available evidence or information.

  「らしい」 can attach to the plain form of verbs, い-adjectives, the stem of な-adjectives, and nouns. For example, 「行くらしい」 (I hear they're going), 「美味しいらしい」 (It seems delicious), 「元気らしい」 (He seems healthy), or 「雨らしい」 (It seems like rain).

  This expression is versatile and can be used in both casual and somewhat formal contexts, though its primary function is to convey information that is not personally verified. It often implies that the speaker has a good reason for their inference, such as having heard it from a reliable source or having observed clear signs.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜そうだ (hear that)
    meaning: I heard that, it is said that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そうだ」 (hearsay) implies information directly received from a specific source (e.g., news,
      a person told you), often carrying a stronger sense of being a direct report. In contrast, 「らしい」
      implies an inference from general information, common knowledge, or observable signs, making the
      source less direct or specific.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Sentence]そうだ (I heard・it is said)
  - term: '[Adj-stem]・[V-stem]そうだ (looks・seems like)'
    meaning: It looks like, seems like (based on direct observation).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そうだ」 (appearance) is based on direct visual or sensory observation, indicating something
      'looks' or 'appears' a certain way (e.g., 'it looks delicious'). 「らしい」, on the other hand, is an
      inference based on less direct signs or general impressions, often including hearsay.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]・[い-Adjective-stem]・[な-Adjective]そうだ (it seems・looks like)'
  - term: ようだ (it seems)
    meaning: It seems that, it appears that, it looks like (based on speaker's conjecture).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようだ」 is a subjective judgment or conjecture based on the speaker's personal impression or
      feeling, often with a sense of 'it's like X' or 'it resembles X'. 「らしい」 is more objective, based
      on information or observable signs that lead to an inference, and implies a stronger likelihood
      of truth.
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
  - term: みたい (similar to)
    meaning: Like, Similar to, Resembling; seems like.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「みたい」 is a casual version of 「ようだ」, expressing subjective conjecture or resemblance. It often
      implies a more vague or less certain impression than 「らしい」. While 「らしい」 often suggests a logical
      inference from evidence, 「みたい」 can be a simpler, more intuitive guess.
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「らしい」, 「そうだ」, 「ようだ」, and 「みたい」, consider the source
  and certainty of the information. 「らしい」 is about inferring something based on general information, common
  sense, or observable signs. 「そうだ」 for hearsay is about reporting what you've been told directly. 「そうだ」
  for appearance is about direct sensory observation. 「ようだ」 and 「みたい」 are more about subjective conjecture
  or resemblance based on your personal impression, with 「みたい」 being the most casual.

          - 田中 先生 は 今日、遅れる そう です。
        english: I heard Tanaka-sensei will be late today (from a direct source).
        hint: 「そうです」 here implies a direct report from a specific source, like an announcement or another
          person. We're looking for a more general inference or hearsay.
    scene: A student tells another student about their teacher before class starts.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    nuance: This sentence uses 「らしい」 to convey information about the teacher's lateness. It suggests the
      speaker heard it indirectly or inferred it from some general sign, rather than being told directly
      by the teacher themselves.

        english: This cake looks very delicious (based on appearance).
        hint: 「そうだ」 (appearance) refers to a direct visual judgment, like 'it looks delicious'. We are
          looking for an inference based on something less direct, like what people generally say or what
          is implied.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ケーキ は とても 美味しい よう だ。
          - この ケーキ は とても 美味しい みたい だ。
        english: This cake seems very delicious (based on subjective impression).

    scene: Someone observes a cake on display in a cafe or hears positive comments about it from other
      customers.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang
    nuance: The speaker's use of 「らしい」 suggests they haven't tasted the cake themselves, but are inferring
      its deliciousness from external factors such as its appealing appearance, enticing smell, or what
      they've heard from others.

    register: casual
    setting: friendly

          impression or rumor.
    scene: Colleagues gossiping about their newly appointed boss in the office break room.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of 「らしい」 here implies that the speaker has not directly experienced the manager's
      strictness but has heard about it through office chatter or observation of their behavior, making
      it an inference rather than a direct statement of fact. This is common in professional settings
      when discussing new colleagues based on early impressions.
  - english: It seems they've already finished the project.
    japanese:
      - 彼 ら は もう プロジェクト を 終え た {らしい}。

        english: I heard they've already finished the project (from a direct report).

    scene: A team leader checking on project progress and noticing signs that it might be complete, but
      not having received a formal report yet.
    register: formal
    setting: professional

      based on visible progress or unofficial reports, rather than a formally confirmed fact. This allows
      for a cautious statement.
  - english: It seems the train hasn't arrived yet.
    japanese:
      - 電車 は まだ 着い て い ない {らしい}。

        english: It appears the train hasn't arrived yet (subjective observation).
        hint: 「ようだ」 would be a more subjective observation. 「らしい」 suggests an inference based on what
          is commonly known or observed in the situation, like a lack of announcements or the platform
          being empty.
    scene: People waiting at a train station, observing the platform and the lack of announcements, inferring
      that the train is delayed.
    register: casual
    setting: emergency/alarm

      train visible, no announcements, or general delays. It's a conclusion based on available, albeit
      indirect, evidence.
  - english: The company seems to be planning a new product launch next month.

    scene: Business partners discussing market trends and potential competitor moves during a casual meeting.
    register: formal

    scene: Two friends discussing a third person's behavior, which suggests a lack of understanding of
      their own error.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of 「らしい」 here implies that the speaker is inferring the person's unawareness based
      on their actions, attitude, or perhaps what others have mentioned, rather than having directly confirmed
      it with the person.
  - english: That rumor seems to be true, actually.
    japanese:

    scene: Friends confirming a piece of gossip they heard, as more and more information comes to light.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang
    nuance: The 「らしい」 here, combined with 「よ」, emphasizes that an initial rumor, which was once indirect
      or uncertain, is now turning out to be correct based on accumulating signs or new information. The
      「よ」 adds a sense of sharing new information or confirming something for the listener.
  - english: I heard it's going to rain tomorrow, is that right?

      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 は 雨 だ そう です が、本当？
        english: I heard it's going to rain tomorrow (from forecast), but is it true?
        hint: 「だそうです」 is more commonly used when quoting a direct report like a weather forecast. 「らしい」
          here expresses a more general inference or hearsay when asking for confirmation.
    scene: Someone asking a friend about the weather forecast for an outdoor event the next day.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: This example uses 「らしい」 to seek confirmation for information that the speaker has received
      indirectly (e.g., heard it from someone, saw a quick glance at a forecast). The 「けど、本当？」 part directly
      asks for verification.
  - english: Mommy seems tired.
    japanese:
      - ママ は 疲れ て いる {らしい}。
      - ママ は 疲れ て いる {らしい} です。
    english_literally: Mommy is tired it seems.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:

          - ママ は 疲れ て いる みたい だ。
        english: Mommy appears tired (subjective impression).
        hint: 「ようだ」/「みたいだ」 express a subjective appearance. 「らしい」 implies a more logical inference based
          on observations like slow movements or frequent sighs.
    scene: A child observes their mother after a long day, noting signs of fatigue like yawning or slow
      movements.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: This is a simple observation and inference by a child using 「らしい」. It indicates that the child
      perceives their mother to be tired based on observable signs, even if the mother hasn't explicitly
      said so. The phrasing is common for children reporting an inferred state.
  - english: The project's deadline is quite strict, it appears.
    japanese:
      - プロジェクト の 締め切り は 結構 厳しい {らしい}。
      - プロジェクト の 締め切り は 結構 厳しい {らしい} です。
    english_literally: Project's deadline is quite strict it seems.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - プロジェクト の 締め切り は 結構 厳しい よう だ。
        english: The project's deadline appears quite strict (subjective impression).
        hint: 「ようだ」 would convey a subjective impression. 「らしい」 is an inference based on received information
          or observed circumstances about the project, like the number of tasks or limited time.
    scene: A new team member getting information about a project from a colleague, inferring the strictness
      of the deadline from the discussion.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: Here, 「らしい」 conveys an inference about the project's deadline. It suggests the speaker has
      gathered information or observed circumstances that lead them to conclude the deadline is strict,
      rather than having it explicitly stated by a superior.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the subtle differences between 「らしい」 and its similar expressions is
  key to natural Japanese. While 「らしい」 infers from evidence or indirect information, choosing the right
  nuance depends on whether you are reporting a direct source, making a subjective judgment, or stating
  a direct observation.
