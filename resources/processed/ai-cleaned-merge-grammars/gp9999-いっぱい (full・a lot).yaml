formation:
  '[Noun] + いっぱい': Expresses that the noun is full, filled with, or surrounded by something; or performing
    an action with all of that noun's capacity/effort.
  いっぱい + [Verb]: Modifies a verb to express a large quantity, completeness, or to the fullest extent of
    the action.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The word いっぱい (一杯) originates from the combination of 一 (ichi - one) and 杯 (hai/pai - a counter
  for cups, or a cupful). Initially, it literally referred to 'one cupful' or 'a cup full.' Over time,
  its meaning broadened significantly to encompass general 'fullness,' 'a large quantity,' or 'to the
  maximum extent,' as seen in expressions like '力 いっぱい' (with all one's strength). This expansion from
  a concrete measurement to a more abstract concept of completeness or abundance is a natural linguistic
  evolution.
writeup: いっぱい is a highly versatile Japanese word with a core meaning centered around 'fullness' or 'completeness.'
  However, its applications extend to expressing 'a large quantity,' 'to the utmost extent,' or even being
  'covered in' something. It functions primarily as a noun that can also be used adverbially.
false_friends:
  - term: たくさん
    meaning: many; a lot
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 「たくさん」 and 「いっぱい」 express large quantity. However, 「いっぱい」 specifically denotes 'fullness'
      or 'capacity,' and can also convey 'with all one's effort.' 「たくさん」 does not carry these additional
      meanings of capacity or effort.
    grammar_point: たくさん (many・a lot)
  - term: 全部
    meaning: all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「全部」 refers to the entirety of something. 「いっぱい」 can mean 'completely' or 'to capacity,' but
      unlike 「全部」, it doesn't necessarily imply 'all of the components.' For instance, 「お腹 が いっぱい」 means
      'full stomach,' not 'all of stomach.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:全部 (all)
  - term: 十分
    meaning: enough; sufficient
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「十分」 means 'sufficient' or 'ample.' While something 'full' (いっぱい) might also be 'sufficient'
      (十分), the primary meaning of 「いっぱい」 is 'filled to capacity' or 'a large quantity,' rather than just
      'adequate.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:十分 (enough・suficient)
  - term: いっぱいです
    meaning: full (polite)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いっぱいです」 is simply the polite form of expressing the state of being 'full' or 'a lot.' The
      base word 「いっぱい」 itself carries the core meaning and can be used in various grammatical structures
      beyond just being a predicate.
    grammar_point: です (polite copula)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「いっぱい」 can often be translated as 'a lot' or 'many,' similar to 「たくさん」,
  it carries additional nuances. 「いっぱい」 often implies reaching a maximum capacity or being completely
  filled, whether literally (e.g., a full cup) or figuratively (e.g., a full schedule, or doing something
  with maximum effort). In contrast, 「たくさん」 simply denotes a large quantity without the implication of
  capacity or effort. 「全部」 focuses on the entirety of items or a collection, meaning 'all' or 'whole.'
  While 「いっぱい」 can describe something being 'completely' filled, it refers more to the state of being
  filled rather than the sum of its parts. 「十分」 means 'enough' or 'sufficient.' While a 'full' (いっぱい)
  state might also be 'sufficient' (十分), the primary focus of 「いっぱい」 is the state of being filled to capacity,
  not merely meeting a requirement or standard. Therefore, when choosing between these words, consider
  whether you want to emphasize quantity, completeness of a collection, or the state of being filled to
  capacity or maximum effort.
