    "etymology": "The word 「もう」 originally meant \"again\" or \"more.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the idea of something being completed or no longer continuing, hence its meanings of \"already\" and \"anymore.\" This duality reflects its root in indicating an increase or repetition that eventually led to the concept of reaching a point or limit.",
    "writeup": "「もう」 is a versatile word that primarily translates to \"already\" in affirmative sentences and \"anymore\" in negative sentences. The core meaning stems from the idea that something has unexpectedly ended or reached a conclusion. In past tense affirmative sentences, 「もう」 indicates that an action has been completed sooner than expected, hence \"already.\" In negative sentences, 「もう」 signifies that a state or action that was expected to continue has ceased, hence \"anymore.\" 「もう」 can also be used in questions to confirm if something has already happened, implying the speaker suspects it might have. Beyond these, 「もう」 is also frequently used to mean \"more\" or \"another\" when referring to quantities (e.g., 「もう一つ」 - one more) or to indicate that something is \"already soon\" or \"almost here\" when paired with expressions of time like 「すぐ」. It can also act as an interjection to express exasperation, frustration, or a feeling of having reached one's limit, as in 「もう無理」 (mou muri - I can't anymore). While 「もう」 can be used across various registers, its directness often lends itself to casual conversations. However, it is also perfectly acceptable in formal speech when paired with polite verb forms.",
