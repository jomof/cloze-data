    "etymology": "The term 「やがて」 originally expressed the idea of something that was expected or known but had not yet occurred. It could mean 'presently' or 'soon after'. Over time, its meaning has evolved to primarily indicate a future event happening soon or eventually, or approaching a certain point in time or condition. The kanji 軈て, combining 軈 (to reach, to arrive) and て (a particle), visually conveys this sense of imminence or approaching a state.",
    "writeup": "「やがて」 is an adverb that indicates an event or state will occur within a relatively short, unspecified period of time, or that a certain point in time or condition is approaching. It can be translated as \"before long,\" \"eventually,\" \"in the end,\" or \"nearly.\" When used with a specified amount of time or age, 「やがて」 commonly means \"nearly\" or \"almost.\" For instance, 「やがて60歳になる」 means \"I'm nearly 60 years old.\" While the kanji 軈て exists, 「やがて」 is almost exclusively written in hiragana in modern Japanese. The term is generally considered formal or literary in register.",

            "nuance": "「そのうち」 suggests a less specific future time, 'at some point' or 'eventually', often with a casual feel and without the sense of natural inevitability of 「やがて」. It can imply a more passive waiting or a less definite plan.",

            "nuance": "「間もなく」 emphasizes immediate proximity, highlighting that the event will happen in a very short period, often with a sense of formality or announcement.

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion between these similar expressions, consider the nuance of inevitability and natural progression. 「やがて」 often suggests an outcome that will happen as a natural result of ongoing circumstances or the passage of time. 「もうすぐ」 and 「間もなく」 both imply a very near future, with 「間もなく」 often being slightly more formal or indicative of a very precise, imminent arrival. 「そのうち」 is more casual and indicates 'at some point in the not-too-distant future' without strong conviction about the exact timing or cause. 「いずれ」 is the most general for 'eventually', often implying a more distant or unspecified future where the outcome is certain, but the path or timing is less defined.",
