    "etymology": "The term 「やがて」 originally expressed the idea of something that was expected or known but had not yet occurred. It could mean 'presently' or 'soon after'. Over time, its meaning has evolved to primarily indicate a future event happening soon or eventually, or approaching a certain point in time or condition. The kanji 軈て, combining 軈 (to reach, to arrive) and て (a particle), visually conveys this sense of imminence or approaching a state.",
    "writeup": "「やがて」 is an adverb that indicates an event or state will occur within a relatively short, unspecified period of time, or that a certain point in time or condition is approaching. It can be translated as \"before long,\" \"eventually,\" \"in the end,\" or \"nearly.\" When used with a specified amount of time or age, 「やがて」 commonly means \"nearly\" or \"almost.\" For instance, 「やがて60歳になる」 means \"I'm nearly 60 years old.\" While the kanji 軈て exists, 「やがて」 is almost exclusively written in hiragana in modern Japanese. The term is generally considered formal or literary in register.",
