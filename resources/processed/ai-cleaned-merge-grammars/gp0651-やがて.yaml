    "etymology": "The term 「やがて」 originally expressed the idea of something that was expected or known but had not yet occurred. Over time, its meaning has evolved to primarily indicate a future event happening soon or eventually.",
    "writeup": "「やがて」 is an adverb used at the beginning of a sentence to express that something will happen in a relatively short, unspecified amount of time. It can be translated as \"before long,\" \"eventually,\" or \"in the end.\" It implies that the state or event is expected to occur. While 「やがて」is most commonly written in hiragana, it can also be written as 軈て, though this is rare. Note that when used with a specified time, 「やがて」can mean \"nearly.\"",
