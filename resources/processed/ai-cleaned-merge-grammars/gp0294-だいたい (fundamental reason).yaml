meaning: In the first place; for crying out loud
pronunciation:
  katakana: ダイタイ
  romaji: daitai
formation:
  だいたい + [Statement of fundamental reason/complaint]: Introduces a fundamental reason, a strong complaint,
    or a basic truth that underpins an argument, often with a sense of exasperation.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express frustration, criticism, or to state a fundamental, often obvious, truth
    in an argument or explanation. It implies that the point being made is so basic or self-evident that
    it should be understood or addressed first.
  function: To introduce a foundational premise, a basic truth, or an exasperated complaint, often implying
    that something went wrong from the very beginning or that a point is being missed.
  nuance: Carries a sense of 'first and foremost,' 'for crying out loud,' or 'what it comes down to.'
    It's often used when the speaker is exasperated or making a strong, foundational point, sometimes
    implying that a previous action or premise was flawed from the start. It can convey a slightly accusatory
    or critical tone.
  colocation: Often appears at the beginning of a sentence or clause. Frequently followed by why-questions
    (なぜ, なんで) or statements of basic fact/problem (～ものだ, ～はずだ, ～おかしい).
etymology: 大体 (だいたい) is formed from the kanji 大 (dai), meaning "large" or "great," and 体 (tai), meaning
  "body" or "substance." Together, they suggest the main, essential, or foundational part of something.
  This meaning evolved to encompass the idea of 'in the first place' or 'fundamentally,' as one addresses
  the 'main body' or 'core' of an issue before anything else. It highlights the primary, underlying point.
writeup: |-
  だいたい (daitai) serves as an adverb that introduces a fundamental reason, a core complaint, or a basic truth. Unlike its other nuance which indicates approximation, this usage of だいたい emphasizes a point that should be considered first or that underpins an entire situation, often with a sense of frustration or exasperation from the speaker.

  It's frequently used to express an opinion about a situation that has gone wrong, or to question the very basis of an argument. When used in this manner, it can convey a tone similar to "for crying out loud," "honestly," or "what it comes down to." It highlights a core issue that, from the speaker's perspective, is so obvious or essential it should have been acknowledged earlier or handled differently.
false_friends:
  - term: そもそも
    meaning: in the first place, to begin with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そもそも」 strictly refers to the origin or fundamental premise of something, often used to challenge
      or question the very basis of a situation, implying it shouldn't have happened or started at all.
      While similar to だいたい in meaning 'in the first place,' だいたい can be used more broadly to introduce
      a fundamental reason or complaint without necessarily challenging the initial premise in the same
      absolute way. だいたい focuses on the core truth or immediate flaw, whereas そもそも questions the genesis
      itself.
    grammar_point: そもそも (in the first place)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「だいたい」 and 「そもそも」 both translate to "in the first place," but their core nuances
  differ. 「そもそも」 is about the origin and challenges the very beginning of something. For instance, if
  you say 「そもそも、そんな計画を立てるべきではなかった」 ("In the first place, you shouldn't have made such a plan"), you're
  criticizing the foundational decision. On the other hand, 「だいたい」, while also introducing a fundamental
  point, often conveys exasperation about a current situation or a general truth, rather than strictly
  focusing on the absolute origin. For example, 「だいたい、そんな言い方はないでしょう？」 ("For crying out loud, you can't
  say that, can you?") expresses a general complaint about manners, not necessarily their origin.
examples:
  - english: In the first place, why did you do such a thing?
    japanese:

      - だいたい なぜ そんな こと を し た の？

          - そもそも なぜ あなた は そんな こと を し た の です か？
        english: Why did you do such a thing to begin with?
        hint: 「そもそも」 strongly questions the fundamental premise or origin, implying the action should
          not have happened at all. We're looking for a slightly broader, exasperated fundamental question.
    scene: A parent scolding their child for a mischievous act.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「なぜ」 combined with 「だいたい」 conveys strong exasperation and a questioning of fundamental
      logic, implying that the action should not have happened at all. The direct question form 「…したのですか？」
      reinforces the scolding tone often used by parents towards children, or between older individuals
      towards younger ones when expressing disappointment or bewilderment.

  jlpt: N4
  details:
    part-of-speech: adverb
    register: teineigo (polite)
    usage-context: general
    function: Indicates approximation, generality, or a fundamental reason.
    nuance: Can express a sense of 'for the most part,' 'roughly,' or 'fundamentally,' often used when something
      is not exact but close enough, or when questioning the basic premise of a situation.
    colocation: Often precedes numbers, quantities, or general statements; can also be used at the beginning
      of a sentence to introduce a fundamental point or a general summary.
  etymology: 大体 (だいたい) is formed from the kanji 大 (だい), meaning "large" or "great," and 体 (たい), meaning
    "body" or "substance." Together, they suggest the main or essential part of something, which leads to
    its various meanings of 'generally,' 'roughly,' or 'in the first place.' It emphasizes the 'broad outline'
    or 'main point' rather than precise details.
  writeup: |-
    **だいたい (daitai)** functions as an adverb in Japanese, primarily indicating the "main point" or "essence" of something, leading to various nuances. It is commonly translated as "mostly," "generally," or "for the most part," conveying an approximate quantity, degree, or typicality. This grammar point can modify entire phrases or be used directly before a noun in the form of **大体の + noun**.

    Furthermore, だいたい can also convey the meaning of "in the first place," similar to **そもそも (somosomo)**. This nuance is often evident when the surrounding sentence implies a desired outcome that unfortunately did not occur, or when questioning the fundamental premise of a situation. For example, when used in an exasperated tone, it can imply a strong fundamental objection or question.
  false_friends:
    - term: ほとんど
      meaning: almost all, mostly, barely
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: ほとんど emphasizes proximity to 100% or completion, often implying a near-total or a near-negative.
        だいたい, on the other hand, indicates a general typicality or a broad approximation, without necessarily
        implying a high percentage near completion. だいたい suggests a rough estimation, while ほとんど suggests
        near completion or near absence.
      grammar_point: ほとんど (almost all or hardly any)
    - term: およそ
      meaning: about, roughly
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: およそ is generally interchangeable with だいたい when referring to numerical approximations. However,
        だいたい has a broader scope, applying to general concepts, states, or main points beyond just numerical
        values, whereas およそ tends to be more strictly quantitative. およそ is often seen as slightly more formal
        and typically precedes numbers.
      grammar_point: およそ・おおよそ (approximate; generally; not at all)
    - term: 約
      meaning: approximately
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 約 is primarily used only with numbers to indicate approximation and is typically more formal
        and precise than だいたい. In contrast, だいたい can be used more broadly with general concepts, states,
        or main points, extending beyond purely numerical contexts. 約 is almost exclusively found in written
        or very formal spoken contexts preceding a numerical value.
      grammar_point: <suggest>:約 (approximately)
    - term: そもそも
      meaning: in the first place, to begin with
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: そもそも strictly refers to the origin or fundamental premise of something, often used to question
        the very basis of a situation. While だいたい can also mean "in the first place," it often implies "why
        did this happen at all?" or "this is the main reason," carrying a nuance of general correctness
        or a fundamental point, rather than merely the initial starting point. そもそも carries a stronger sense
        of challenging the foundational assumption.
      grammar_point: そもそも (in the first place)
  post_false_friends_writeup: While だいたい, ほとんど, およそ, 約, and そもそも all touch upon aspects of approximation
    or fundamental reasoning, understanding their subtle differences is key. だいたい offers the broadest application,
    covering general typicality, approximations, and fundamental aspects. ほとんど focuses on near-completeness.
    およそ and 約 are more specific to numerical approximations, with 約 being the most formal and precise. そもそも
    strictly questions the foundational premise, distinct from だいたい's broader use for general or main points.
