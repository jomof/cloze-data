meaning: A verb in its past (た-form) or progressive (ている-form) directly modifies a noun that follows it,
  describing the noun's action or state.
pronunciation:
  katakana: どうししゅうしょくめいし
  romaji: dōshi shūshoku meishi
  pronunciation_warning: This grammar point describes a syntactic pattern, not a specific word. Its pronunciation
    refers to the Japanese grammatical term for 'verb-modified noun'.
formation:
  Verb[た form] + Noun: Describes a noun that was the object or subject of a completed action or is in
    a resultant state.
  Verb[ている form] + Noun: Describes a noun that is currently performing an action, is in a state resulting
    from an action, or is the object/subject of an ongoing action or habitual state.
jlpt: N4
etymology: This grammatical structure reflects a core principle of Japanese syntax where verb phrases
  can directly precede and modify nouns, similar to adjectives. Unlike English, which often uses relative
  clauses (e.g., 'the man who ran'), Japanese allows a more direct pre-nominal modification using various
  verb forms. The use of the past (た) form to indicate completed action or resultant state and the progressive
  (ている) form for ongoing action or state is a natural extension of their basic verbal functions when used
  attributively.
writeup: |-
  The pattern of a verb directly modifying a noun, specifically using the past (た-form) or progressive (ている-form), is a fundamental and efficient way to describe nouns in Japanese. This construction allows for concise expression, eliminating the need for explicit relative pronouns often found in English, such as 'who,' 'which,' or 'that.'

  When a verb in its た-form directly precedes a noun, it typically describes a noun that has completed a certain action or is in a resultant state due to that action. For example, 「食べた リンゴ」 (the apple that was eaten) or 「壊れた 時計」 (the broken clock). The noun is either the object of the action (as in 食べたリンゴ) or the subject (as in 壊れた時計). The context usually clarifies this relationship.

  Conversely, when a verb in its ている-form modifies a noun, it indicates that the noun is currently performing an action, is undergoing an action, or is in a continuous state. For instance, 「走っている 犬」 (the dog that is running) or 「座っている 人」 (the person who is sitting). This form captures dynamism or a sustained condition. It can also describe a habitual action, such as 「働いている 人」 (a person who is always working).

  This construction is similar in function to adjectives modifying nouns (e.g., 「赤い りんご」 - a red apple), providing descriptive information directly before the noun it modifies. Understanding how verbs can take on this attributive role is crucial for natural Japanese expression.

  - term: '[Clause]こと'
    meaning: nominalization of a clause; the act of...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While {Verb-form}Noun directly modifies a noun, 「〜{動詞}こと」 nominalizes the entire clause or
      action itself, making it a noun. It doesn't modify a specific noun in the sentence.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]こと (the act of・the fact that)'
  - term: い-Adjective + Noun
    meaning: adjectives directly modifying nouns
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Adjectives (い-Adjectives) inherently describe qualities or states of nouns. Verbs in {た・ている}
      forms describe nouns based on their actions or states resulting from actions, providing a dynamic
      or temporal element that simple adjectives do not.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective + Noun (describing nouns)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key distinction between verbs directly modifying nouns and nominalized
  clauses using こと lies in their scope. Verb-modified nouns (e.g., 「読んだ 本」) describe the book's state
  or action. In contrast, clauses ending with こと (e.g., 「本を 読む こと」) treat the entire action of 'reading
  a book' as a noun, often used as the subject or object of another verb or to form a general statement.
  Similarly, while adjectives describe inherent qualities, verbs modifying nouns describe them based on
  actions or resultant states, adding a temporal or dynamic dimension.

        english: I bought the fact that I read a book yesterday.
        hint: This nominalizes the action of reading, not the book itself. We want to describe the book
          that was read.
    scene: Talking to a friend about a recent purchase.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 公園 で 走る の が 可愛い 犬 です。
        english: The dog that runs in the park is cute.

          We want to say 'the dog which is running'.
    scene: Pointing out a dog in the park.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
  - english: The person who called was my mother.
    japanese:

          - 電話 が 鳴っ た 人 は 私 の 母 でし た。
        english: The person for whom the phone rang was my mother.
        hint: This is a roundabout way to say 'the person who called'. We're looking for a direct description
          of the person who initiated the call.
    scene: Explaining to a family member who contacted you.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative

      of gender.

        english: Please return the act of listening to the CD.

          to describe the CD itself.
    scene: A parent asking their child to return an item.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older

          We're looking for a simple description of the picture.
    scene: Showing photos to friends.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「撮った写真」 implies the completed action of taking the photo and the resulting photo itself, directly

        english: He is someone who always works.
        hint: This sentence nominalizes 'working' to describe him as a worker, but we want to directly
          modify 'person' to describe 'a person who is working'.
    scene: Describing a colleague to another colleague.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「働いている人」 uses the ている form to describe a habitual or continuous action, characterizing the
      person as someone who is 'always working'.

          We're looking for a direct description of the noun.
    scene: A formal business meeting discussing an incident.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「発生した事故」 is a standard, formal way to refer to an 'accident that occurred', directly modifying

      context.

    japanese:
      - リビング で {寝 て いる} 猫 は どこ？
      - リビング で {寝 てる} 猫、どこ に いる の？

          - リビング で 猫 が 寝 て いる こと は どこ です か？
        english: Where is the fact that the cat is sleeping in the living room?

          the location of the cat.
    scene: Asking a family member about a pet's location.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    nuance: The casual interrogative 「どこ？」 is typical in an intimate setting. 「寝ている 猫」 indicates the cat
      is currently in the act of sleeping, describing the cat by its ongoing state.
  - english: The money I saved will be used for my trip.
    japanese:
      - '{貯め た} お 金 は 旅行 に 使わ れ ます。'
      - '{貯め た} お 金 が 旅行 に 使わ れる よ。'

        english: The act of saving money will be used for the trip.
        hint: This focuses on 'the act of saving money' as the subject, not the money itself. We want
          to describe the money that was saved.
    scene: Talking about future plans.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「貯めた お金」 concisely means 'money that I saved,' highlighting the completed action of saving
      and its direct effect on the noun 'money'.
  - english: I bought a present for the child who is crying.
    japanese:

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 が 泣い て いる こと に プレゼント を 買い まし た。
        english: I bought a present for the fact that the child is crying.
        hint: This phrasing indicates the present was for 'the fact' of crying, which is illogical. We
          want to give a present to the child.
    scene: Explaining to a friend why you bought a gift.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「泣いている 子供」 specifies the child by their current emotional state, which is clearly visible.
      The speaker's use of 「買いました」 (bought) indicates a completed action.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, this structure is highly versatile. It is a
  fundamental building block for forming complex sentences in Japanese. Pay close attention to whether
  the verb is describing a completed action/resultant state (た-form) or an ongoing/habitual action (ている-form)
  of the noun.
