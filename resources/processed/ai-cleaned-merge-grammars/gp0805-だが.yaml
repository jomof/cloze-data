    "writeup": "**だが** is a conjunction used to express a contrast or contradiction, similar to \"but\" or \"however\" in English. It connects two sentences, with the second sentence presenting something unexpected or different from what the first sentence suggests. While it appears in written Japanese and formal speech, it is less common in everyday conversation. In spoken Japanese, **だけど**, **でも**, or **が** are generally preferred. Think of it as a slightly more formal or literary way to say \"but.\"",
    "etymology": "The etymology of **だが** comes from the copula **だ** (a more assertive form of **です**) followed by **が** (but). So, it literally translates to something along the lines of \"it is, but...\" or \"that is so, but...\".",
