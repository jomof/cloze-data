    "etymology": "「だが」 is derived from 「だ」 (copula) + 「が」 (conjunction). The 「が」 indicates a contrast or exception, similar to its use in other grammatical structures.",
    "writeup": "「だが」 is a conjunction used to express a strong contrast or contradiction between two statements, similar to \"but\" or \"however\" in English. Its usage is predominantly found in **written Japanese and formal speech**. Unlike more casual conjunctions such as 「でも」, 「だけど」, 「けれど」, or 「けれども」, 「だが」 carries a more definitive and objective tone. It is rarely used in spoken Japanese unless immediately followed by 「ね」 (e.g., 「だがね」), which slightly softens its directness. The conjunction serves to introduce a counter-statement or an unexpected turn of events, often highlighting a logical or factual discrepancy.",
