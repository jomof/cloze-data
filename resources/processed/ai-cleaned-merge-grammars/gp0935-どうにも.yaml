    "etymology": "どうにも is derived from 「どう」 (how), 「に」 (particle indicating manner), and 「も」 (particle indicating 'even'). It literally means 'even if one tries in any way,' implying a situation where all efforts are futile.",
    "writeup": "「どうにも」 is an expression often paired with negative structures such as 「できない」 ('cannot'), 「ならない」 ('won't happen'), or 「ようがない」 ('no way'). It combines the adverb 「どう」 ('how'), the case marking particle 「に」, and the adverbial particle 「も」, and may be translated as 'even however (A), still not (B)'. The entire structure is usually interpreted simply as 'it is meaningless to (A)', 'there's nothing one can do about (A)', or 'nothing will come of (A)'.\n\n「どうにも」 is typically found at the start or end of sentences, before or after explaining a situation that seems impossible due to some specific reason. This grammar pattern emphasizes the speaker's feelings of resignation, frustration, or regret regarding something out of their control. Consequently, it often highlights the actions of someone other than the speaker.\n\nOccasionally, 「どうにも」 is further emphasized by the addition of 「こうにも」.",
