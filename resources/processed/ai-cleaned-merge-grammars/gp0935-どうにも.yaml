        "usage-context": "Used to express a sense of helplessness, resignation, or frustration regarding an uncontrollable situation or an action that is impossible to achieve.",
        "function": "To emphasize absolute impossibility, resignation, or futility despite one's efforts or desire.",
        "nuance": "Conveys a strong sense of futility, frustration, or inevitability, often implying that a situation is entirely beyond one's ability to influence or change. It suggests that even if one tried everything, the outcome would remain unchanged."
    },
    "etymology": "The adverb 「どうにも」 is formed by combining the interrogative adverb 「どう」 (how, in what way), the dative particle 「に」 (indicating means or direction), and the particle 「も」 (meaning 'even' or 'also', often implying exhaustiveness or universality). Historically, 「どうに」 already carried the sense of 'in any way' or 'by any means'. The addition of 「も」 further emphasizes this, translating literally to 'even by any means' or 'no matter what method one tries'. This structure naturally evolved to express a strong sense of impossibility or futility, where 'even if you try all ways, it's still not possible.'",
    "writeup": "「どうにも」 is a versatile adverb that conveys a strong sense of impossibility, helplessness, or resignation. It is always used in conjunction with a negative form of a verb or an auxiliary verb, such as **できない** (cannot), **ならない** (won't happen), **いかない** (won't go well), or **～しようがない** (there's no way to do X).\n\nThis expression is typically used to describe situations that are beyond one's control, or actions that cannot be accomplished despite efforts or desires. It highlights the speaker's frustration, regret, or a feeling of being powerless in the face of circumstances. 「どうにも」 can be placed at the beginning or end of sentences, often preceding the negative clause it modifies.\n\nOccasionally, the emphatic form 「どうにもこうにも」 is used. The addition of **こうにも** further intensifies the meaning, stressing that there is absolutely *nothing* that can be done, no matter how one tries. It expresses an even deeper level of futility and despair. Both forms are widely used in spoken Japanese and can appear across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal discussions, though the inherent emotionality often makes it suited for more informal contexts.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「無理だ」 or a simple negative verb expression conveys inability, 「どうにも」 adds a layer of the speaker's personal feeling of futility or resignation. It implies that despite attempts, wishes, or circumstances, the desired outcome cannot be achieved, highlighting an inescapable sense of powerlessness. Therefore, when you want to express a stronger emotional nuance of 'nothing can be done about it' rather than just a factual statement of impossibility, 「どうにも」 is the appropriate choice.",
