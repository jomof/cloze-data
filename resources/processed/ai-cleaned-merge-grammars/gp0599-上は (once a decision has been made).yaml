The 「は」 (wa) is a topic marker, emphasizing the preceding condition. Etymologically, it suggests \"now that we are on top of this situation\" or \"now that this has been decided.\"",
    "writeup": "「上は」 is a somewhat old-fashioned expression that indicates a sense of commitment or consequence arising from a prior decision or action. It can be translated as \"once,\" \"since,\" \"now that,\" or \"as long as.\" The implication is that since a certain action (A) has been taken, a certain consequence or commitment (B) is expected or required. Because 「上は」 sounds stiff, in modern conversation, you'll more commonly hear 「からには」 or 「以上は」, which have similar meanings. It is mainly used in formal writing or speech. It emphasizes the speaker's resolve to fulfill the expected outcome.",

Using 「べき だ」 instead of 「べき です」 makes the advice slightly more direct and less overtly polite, often used when urgency or formality is paramount.",
