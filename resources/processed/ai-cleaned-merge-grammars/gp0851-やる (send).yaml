    "etymology": "The verb 「やる」 originally meant \"to do\" or \"to perform.\" Over time, it acquired the additional meaning of \"to give\" or \"to send,\" particularly when the giver is in a position of authority or superiority. The nuance is that the action is done for someone, often with an implication of the giver's dominance or the receiver's need.",
    "writeup": "The う-Verb 「やる」, occasionally seen in the kanji form 「遣る」, primarily means “to do”, but can also mean “to give” as the casual form of 「あげる」. When attached to the て-form of verbs, it acts as a subsidiary verb.\n\nWhen substituting for 「あげる」, it will often sound patronizing, or that the speaker is doing an action because it is unavoidable, and the person they are doing it for cannot do it themselves. This will be translated as “to do for”.\n\nIn other cases, 「やる」 acts more like 「見せる」 “to show”, and indicates the speaker’s strong will to perform an action. In these cases, it will be translated as “I will do (A), just wait and see”, or “I’ll definitely do (A)”.\n\nHowever, in either the place of 「あげる」 or 「みせる」, the underlying meaning is just “to do”, with emphasis on the doer being the person that is in power over the result of the action due to their superiority.",
