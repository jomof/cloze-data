    "etymology": "The verb 「やる」 originally meant \"to do.\" Over time, it acquired the nuance of giving or doing something for someone considered lower in status, such as pets, children, or subordinates. It can also carry a nuance of demonstrating one's ability or resolve.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「やる」, often written as 遣る in kanji, is a versatile term with several core meanings.\n\n*   **\"To do\" or \"To perform\"**: This is its most common and fundamental meaning, akin to 「する」. It can apply to actions, tasks, or activities.\n*   **\"To give\"**: As a casual form of 「あげる」, 「やる」 is used when giving something to someone of lower status (e.g., children, pets, subordinates) or to plants. Using it for adults or superiors can sound condescending or rude.\n*   **\"To send\" or \"To dispatch\"**: In this context, it implies sending someone or something to a destination.\n\nWhen 「やる」 is attached to the て-form of another verb (Ｖて + やる), it functions as a subsidiary verb, adding specific nuances related to the speaker's action and attitude. In this form, it indicates one of two primary interpretations:\n\n*   **Performing an action for someone of lower status**: Similar to the \"to give\" meaning, this usage implies the speaker is doing something for someone they perceive as inferior, unable to do it themselves, or as a condescending favor. It often carries a patronizing or somewhat forceful tone.\n*   **Expressing strong resolve or intent**: Here, 「Ｖて + やる」 conveys the speaker's unwavering determination to accomplish something, often against odds or to prove a point. It's akin to saying \"I will definitely do X\" or \"Just wait and see, I'll do X,\" implying a forceful intent to demonstrate ability or achieve a goal.\n\nIn both subsidiary usages of 「Ｖて + やる」, there is an underlying sense of the speaker being in a position of power, superiority, or strong will over the outcome of the action.",
