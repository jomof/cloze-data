        "[Verb -ない form] + ほうがいい": "Expressing advice or recommendation not to do something."

    "etymology": "The grammar point is composed of 「ない」 (nai), the negative form of ある (aru, to exist), 「方」 (hō), meaning 'direction' or 'way,' 「が」 (ga), a particle, and 「いい」 (ii), meaning 'good.' Literally, it suggests that 'the way of not doing' something is better.",
    "writeup": "Similar to 「たほうがいい」, 「ないほうがいい」 is used to give advice in Japanese. This expression suggests that it is better *not* to do something. It is constructed by using the negative form of a verb plus 「方がいい」. 「方」 can be translated as \"way\" or \"direction,\" suggesting that one specific choice is the better 'way' to proceed. This expression is quite direct and can imply there may be some negative consequences if you do the action.",
