    "etymology": "ほう (方) means \"direction\" or \"way,\" and がいい means \"is good.\" Thus, ないほうがいい literally translates to \"the way of not doing is good,\" implying it's better not to do something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ないほうがいい」 is used to give advice or a suggestion that it would be better *not* to do something. It is the negative counterpart to 「たほうがいい」, which advises doing something. The expression 「ないほうがいい」 is a direct way of giving advice, and while not overly harsh, it strongly implies that undesirable outcomes could follow if the advice is not heeded. As 方 can be translated closely to 'way' or 'direction', this expression is suggesting that one specific choice is simply the better 'way'.",
