formation:
  Noun + を + 求める: To seek, ask for, demand, or wish for a tangible or intangible noun.
  Verb[dictionary] + ことを + 求める: To request or demand that an action be performed.
  Verb[て] + 求める: To seek or request something by performing an action (less common, often implied).
jlpt: N3
etymology: The kanji 求 (kyuu, motomeru) depicts an ancient image of an animal's hide, perhaps suggesting
  the act of seeking or hunting for it. Over time, its meaning expanded to encompass the broader concept
  of 'seeking,' 'demanding,' or 'wishing for' something, whether tangible or intangible. The verb 求める
  thus carries the inherent sense of active pursuit or strong inclination towards an object or outcome.
writeup: |-
  求める is a versatile verb with several core meanings: to seek, to ask for, to demand, and to wish for. Its specific nuance depends heavily on context and the direct object it takes.

  **1. To Seek/Search:** This usage often applies to abstract concepts or things that are not easily found, emphasizing an active pursuit. Examples include seeking truth (真実を求める), happiness (幸せを求める), knowledge (知識を求める), or solutions (解決策を求める).

  **2. To Ask For/Request:** When used in this sense, 求める implies making a request or asking for something, often in a formal or earnest manner. This can range from asking for an interview (面会を求める) to requesting cooperation (協力を求める).

  **3. To Demand/Claim:** This is a stronger usage, indicating a firm insistence on something, often related to rights, compensation, or explanations. For instance, demanding compensation (賠償を求める) or demanding an apology (謝罪を求める). In this context, it implies that the speaker believes they are entitled to what they are asking for.

  **4. To Wish For/Desire:** This meaning expresses a strong desire or aspiration for something to exist or happen, often peace (平和を求める) or a better future (より良い未来を求める). While similar to 'wish,' it often carries a more proactive or heartfelt connotation than a simple desire.

  When using 求める, pay attention to the context to understand whether it implies a gentle wish, a firm demand, or a dedicated search.
false_friends:
  - term: 要求する
    meaning: to demand or request (often official/stronger)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both can mean 'to request,' 要求する typically implies a more formal, official, or forceful
      demand, often related to rights or responsibilities. 求める can be a softer request or a general seeking.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:要求する (to demand or request)
  - term: 探す
    meaning: to search for, to look for (physical or concrete)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 探す specifically refers to physically searching for something lost or unknown, or looking for
      something concrete. 求める can refer to seeking abstract things (e.g., truth, peace) as well as making
      requests or demands.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:探す (to search or look for)
  - term: 願う
    meaning: to wish, to hope, to pray, to request (often polite/earnest)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 願う implies a heartfelt wish or a polite, humble request. 求める can also be a request, but it
      lacks the strong sense of personal desire or supplication often present in 願う, and can even imply
      a strong demand.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:願う (to wish or hope)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 求める covers a broad range of 'seeking' or 'desiring' actions, it's important
  to differentiate it from other verbs that might seem similar. For instance, **要求する** carries a stronger
  sense of insistence or demanding what one believes they are owed, whereas 求める can be a more general
  act of seeking or a less forceful request. **探す** is specifically about physically looking for something,
  while 求める extends to abstract concepts like truth or peace. Lastly, **願う** often implies a more personal,
  heartfelt wish or a humble plea, which can be part of 求める's range but isn't its primary focus when emphasizing
  active pursuit or demand.

        english: The victims insisted on an explanation from the company.

    scene: News report about a corporate scandal.

    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: Here, {求めた} implies a strong demand, as in 'demanded an explanation,' rather than a mere request.

      forceful side of the verb.

        english: The student made a request for an extension of the deadline.
        hint: 「依頼する」 (to request/commission) implies asking for a service or favor. While an extension

        english: Even if you look for happiness, it won't always be found.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 幸せ を 追求 し て も、いつ も 見つかる と は 限ら ない。
        english: Even if you pursue happiness, it won't always be found.
        hint: 「追求する」 (to pursue) suggests a continuous effort to achieve or investigate something. While
          very close in meaning here, 「求める」 is often simpler and can imply a desire as much as an active
          pursuit.
    scene: A character reflects on life's difficulties.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: concessive (～ても)
    nuance: The concessive form {求めても} (even if one seeks) highlights the potential futility despite effort.
      It's a more philosophical usage, acknowledging that even active pursuit doesn't guarantee a desired
      outcome. The phrase 「見つかるとは限らない」 (not necessarily found) reinforces this uncertainty.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 求める is a versatile verb. It can describe anything
  from an abstract pursuit like seeking truth or happiness, to a concrete request or demand like asking
  for an extension or demanding an explanation. The nuance largely depends on the context and the noun
  that is being 'sought' or 'demanded'. Always consider the intensity and formality conveyed by the situation
  when using this verb.
