grammar_point: Verb[ないで] (negative without doing)
learn_before:
  - Verb[て] (and then)
  - Verb[ない] (plain negative)
id: gp9999
meaning: without doing something
pronunciation:
  katakana: ナイデ
  romaji: naide
formation:
  Verb[ない form] + で: Used to connect two clauses, indicating that the action of the first clause is not
    performed before the action of the second clause.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The etymology of 「ないで」 stems from the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 combined with the particle
  「で」. The particle 「で」 originally denoted a means or method, or a cause/reason. In this construction,
  it signifies 'by not doing' or 'without doing,' highlighting the absence of the first action as the
  manner or condition for the second action. It's essentially a negative te-form + で, expressing a state
  or method.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「ないで」 is formed by attaching 「で」 to the plain negative form of a verb. It primarily serves two main functions in Japanese. First, and as indicated by its name, it can connect two clauses, meaning "without doing [the first action], [the second action occurs]". In this usage, the action described by the first verb is omitted or not performed, and the action of the second verb takes place instead or as a consequence. For example, 「傘 を 持た {ないで} 出かけた」 means "I went out without carrying an umbrella."

  Second, and very commonly, it is used to form negative commands or requests, typically in the polite form 「ないでください」 (please don't do something) or more casually as just 「ないで」 (don't do something). While grammatically it's still "without doing, please...", it functions as a direct prohibition. For example, 「ここに座ら {ないで} ください」 means "Please don't sit here." When used casually as just 「ないで」, it can sometimes feel a bit abrupt if not softened by context or intonation. It's important to understand both functions to use it correctly.

  Compared to other ways of expressing "without doing," 「ないで」 is generally informal and conversational. It is often preferred in daily interactions.
false_friends:
  - term: ずに
    meaning: without doing something (more formal)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「ないで」 is common in casual speech, 「ずに」 is a more formal or literary equivalent, often
      used in written Japanese or more formal spoken contexts. For example, 「食べ{ずに} 出かけた」 is more formal
      than 「食べ{ないで} 出かけた」.
    grammar_point: ずに・ないで・ことなく (without doing)
  - term: ことなく
    meaning: without doing (emphasizing complete absence or lack of an action)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ことなく」 carries a stronger nuance of 'not at all' or 'completely without'. It implies a more
      deliberate or absolute absence of the first action. It is also more formal and literary than 「ないで」.
      For example, 「許可を{得る} {ことなく} 入った」 (entered without obtaining permission) emphasizes the complete
      lack of permission.
    grammar_point: ずに・ないで・ことなく (without doing)
  - term: ないでください
    meaning: please don't do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ないで」 is a component of 「ないでください」, the latter functions specifically as a polite negative
      command or request. 「ないで」 on its own, when used as a clause connector, means 'without doing,' rather
      than a direct prohibition.
    grammar_point: てください (polite request)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「ないで」, 「ずに」, and 「ことなく」, consider the level of formality
  and the nuance you wish to convey. 「ないで」 is the most versatile and casual. 「ずに」 offers a slightly more
  formal alternative, especially useful in written contexts. 「ことなく」 emphasizes a complete and deliberate
  absence of an action and is typically reserved for formal or literary settings. Remember that 「ないで」,
  standing alone at the end of a sentence, functions as a casual negative command, which is distinct from
  its role as a connective meaning "without doing."

  - english: I went out without eating breakfast.
    japanese:
      - 朝ご飯 を 食べ {ない で} 出かけ た。
      - 朝ご飯 を 食べ {ない で} 出かけ まし た。

          - 朝ご飯 を 食べ {ず に} 出かけ た。
        english: I went out without eating breakfast (more formal).
        hint: This form is more formal. We're looking for the more common, everyday way to say 'without
          doing'.
    scene: A student rushing out the door in the morning.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang
    nuance: This is a straightforward use of 「ないで」 to indicate an action done without a preceding one.
      The casual register is appropriate for describing a daily occurrence.
  - english: Please don't touch that.
    japanese:
      - それ を 触ら {ない で} ください。
      - それ を 触ら {ない で}。
    english_literally: That, not touching, please.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ を 触る な。
        english: Don't touch that! (stronger, plain imperative).
        hint: This is a very direct and strong command. We're looking for a polite negative request.
    scene: A parent telling their child not to touch a fragile object.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    nuance: Here 「ないで」 is used as part of a polite negative command. 「触ら{ないで}ください」 is a common and polite
      way to tell someone not to do something.

    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 日本 語 を 知ら {ない で} 日本 に 来 た。
      - 彼女 は 日本 語 を 知ら {ない で} 日本 に 来 まし た。
    english_literally: As for her, Japanese, not knowing, came to Japan.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 日本 語 を 知る こと {なく} 日本 に 来 た。
        english: She came to Japan without any knowledge of Japanese (emphasizing complete lack).
        hint: This expression emphasizes the complete absence of the action and is more formal. We're
          looking for a general 'without doing'.
    scene: Two friends discussing a new international student.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This example highlights the state of 'not knowing' as the condition for the second action,
      'coming to Japan'. 「知ら{ないで}」 is natural for this context.
  - english: Don't just stand there, help me!
    japanese:
      - 立っ て いる {ない で}、手伝っ て ください！
      - 立っ て いる {ない で}、手伝っ て！
    english_literally: Standing, not doing, please help!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 立っ て いる な、手伝っ て ください！
        english: Don't stand there! Help me! (stronger, direct command).
        hint: This is a direct, strong prohibition. We want to imply 'instead of just standing there'.
    scene: A busy person urging someone idle to assist.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    nuance: This shows 「ないで」 being used in a slightly idiomatic way, meaning 'instead of just doing X,

      standing there'.
  - english: Please don't worry about it.
    japanese:
      - 心配 し {ない で} ください。

          - 心配 する な。

    scene: A friend comforting another who is stressed.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: supportive
    nuance: A very common polite negative request. 「心配 し{ないで}ください」 is softer and more empathetic than

          expression.

    register: casual

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 傘 を 忘れる な！
        english: Don't forget your umbrella! (strong command).
        hint: This is a strong, direct command. We want a softer, reminder-like expression.

    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: This uses 「ないで」 as a casual, gentle negative command/reminder, softened further by 「ね」. A
      mother might use 「忘れ{ないで}ね」 to her child. The addition of 「ね」 makes it a request for confirmation
      or shared understanding.
  - english: I want to finish this task without anyone's help.
    japanese:
      - 誰 の 助け も 借り {ない で}、この 仕事 を 終わら せ たい。

          - 誰 の 助け も 借りる こと {なく}、この 仕事 を 終わら せ たい。
        english: I want to finish this task completely without anyone's help (more formal, emphasizes

          'without doing'.
    scene: Someone expressing their determination to complete a task independently.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: This example conveys self-reliance, using 「借り{ないで}」 to mean 'without relying on'. It expresses
      a strong personal desire.
  - english: Don't go to sleep yet!
    japanese:
      - まだ 寝 {ない で}！
      - まだ 寝 {ない で} ください。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - まだ 寝る な！
        english: Don't sleep yet! (very strong, plain imperative).
        hint: This is a very blunt command. We want a slightly softer, more pleading negative command.
    scene: Friends on a late night out, one wants to go home.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: Used as a casual negative command, often implying a plea. 「寝{ないで}！」 is a common way to say
      'Don't go to sleep!' among close friends, implying 'Let's stay up longer!'
    etymology: The casual command form 「〜ないで」 often carries a nuance of pleading or light admonishment,
      different from the direct and often harsher 「〜な」 negative imperative. This comes from its origin
      as a connective ('without doing X, do Y'), which makes it inherently less direct as a prohibition.
  - english: She practiced the piano everyday without resting.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 休ま {ない で} 毎日 ピアノ を 練習 し た。
      - 彼女 は 休ま {ない で} 毎日 ピアノ を 練習 し まし た。

        english: She practiced the piano everyday without resting (more formal).
        hint: This version is more formal. We're looking for a neutral, casual description.
    scene: A piano teacher describing a dedicated student.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: This showcases the continuous nature of an action performed without interruption. 「休ま{ないで}」
      emphasizes the lack of breaks during her practice.
  - english: I went home without buying anything.
    japanese:
      - 何 も 買わ {ない で} 家 に 帰っ た。

    english_literally: Anything, not buying, went home.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 何 も 買わ {ず に} 家 に 帰っ た。
        english: I went home without buying anything (more formal).
        hint: This is a more formal phrasing. We're looking for a casual description of an action.
    scene: Someone returning from shopping empty-handed.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「買わ{ないで}」 indicates the omission of the action of buying before returning home. This is a
      common situation easily described with 「ないで」.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「ないで」 is versatile. It can connect two actions, indicating
  that the first action was *not* performed, or it can function as a casual negative command. When used
  as a command, it is often softened by context or an accompanying particle like 「ね」.
