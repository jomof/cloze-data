    "etymology": "「であろう」 is a combination of 「で」 (the te-form of the copula 「だ」) and 「あろう」, which is the volitional form of the verb 「ある」 (to be). It essentially means \"it probably is\" or \"it is likely to be.\"",
    "writeup": "「であろう」 is a formal expression used to express a strong conjecture or probability. It's more commonly found in written language and formal speech. It implies a higher degree of certainty than the more casual 「だろう」. Think of it as a more sophisticated way to say \"probably\" or \"most likely.\" You'll often encounter it in academic papers, news articles, and official announcements. It is rarely used in casual conversation. 「であろう」 can be attached to verbs, adjectives, and nouns to express a probable state or action. It's essential to recognize it in formal contexts to understand the intended level of certainty.",
