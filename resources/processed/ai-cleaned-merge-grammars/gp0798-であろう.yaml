    "etymology": "「であろう」 is a combination of 「で」 (the 連用形 *ren'yōkei* or conjunctive form of the copula 「だ」) and 「あろう」, which is the 意志形 *ishikei* or volitional form of the verb 「ある」 (to be). It literally means \"it probably is\" or \"it is likely to be,\" evolving to express strong conjecture in formal contexts.",
    "writeup": "「であろう」 is a formal expression used to convey a strong conjecture or probability. It is predominantly found in written language and highly formal speech, such as academic papers, news articles, and official announcements. This grammatical form implies a higher degree of certainty compared to its more casual counterpart, 「だろう」. Learners should understand that while both translate to \"probably\" or \"most likely,\" 「であろう」 carries a more authoritative and definitive tone. It is not typically heard in everyday conversations due to its elevated register. 「であろう」 can attach to verbs (in both dictionary and past forms), い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns, allowing for conjectures across various grammatical categories. Recognizing 「であろう」 is crucial for comprehending the nuanced level of certainty and formality in advanced Japanese texts and discourse.",

            "nuance": "「だろう」 is less formal and used more frequently in casual conversation. 「であろう」 is reserved for more formal contexts and written language, carrying a higher degree of certainty and authority."

            "term": "かもしれない",
            "meaning": "might, maybe",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「かもしれない」 expresses a lower probability or possibility compared to 「であろう」. 「であろう」 suggests a much higher degree of certainty and is a stronger conjecture."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The primary distinction among these expressions lies in their formality and the perceived degree of certainty. For casual conversation or when expressing a mild possibility, 「だろう」 or 「かもしれない」 are more suitable. However, when the intention is to convey a strong sense of probability with a formal or authoritative tone, 「であろう」 is the appropriate choice. Always consider the audience and the communication context to select the most fitting expression.",
