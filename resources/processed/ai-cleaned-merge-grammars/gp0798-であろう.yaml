    "meaning": "Indicates the speaker's conjecture or presumption, often without concrete evidence. Similar to \"probably\" or \"likely.\"",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Formal, written language. Less common in everyday conversation.",
        "Usage": "Often used in essays, news reports, and academic writing.",
        "Nuance": "Implies a degree of uncertainty or speculation on the speaker's part.",
        "Related Expressions": "Similar to 「だろう」 but generally considered more formal and literary."

    "formation": {
        "[Verb (dictionary form)] + であろう": "Indicates a probable action or state in the future.",

        "[Noun] + であろう": "Indicates a probable identity or situation."
    },
    "etymology": "「であろう」 is derived from 「である」 (a more formal equivalent of 「だ」, the copula) and 「う」 (an auxiliary verb indicating conjecture or volition). It combines the formality of 「である」 with the speculative nature of 「う」.",
    "writeup": "「であろう」 is a formal expression used to express conjecture or probability, similar to 「だろう」, but with a more literary and stiff nuance. It's often found in written Japanese, such as essays, news articles, and formal speeches, rather than everyday conversation. It implies the speaker is making a reasoned guess without definite proof, like saying \"it is probably the case\" or \"it is likely that.\" 「であろう」 is particularly used in formal contexts where a degree of detachment or objectivity is desired.",

            "etymology": "明日(ashita) 「tomorrow」 is commonly used.",
            "nuance": "「であろう」 adds formality. Using 「だろう」 here would be more casual."

            "english": "That plan will probably succeed.",

            "register": "formal",

            "etymology": "計画 (keikaku) 「plan」 and 成功 (seikou) 「success」 are common N3 kanji.",
            "nuance": "The use of 「であろう」 indicates a formal, somewhat detached tone, suitable for discussing plans objectively."

            "etymology": "最高傑作 (saikou kessaku) 「best masterpiece」 is a relatively advanced term.",
            "nuance": "「であろう」 softens the claim, presenting it as an opinion or a likely conclusion."
