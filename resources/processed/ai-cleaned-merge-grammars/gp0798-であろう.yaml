    "etymology": "「であろう」 is a combination of 「で」 (the 連用形 *ren'yōkei* or conjunctive form of the copula 「だ」) and 「あろう」, which is the 意志形 *ishikei* or volitional form of the verb 「ある」 (to be). It literally means \"it probably is\" or \"it is likely to be,\" evolving to express strong conjecture in formal contexts.",
    "writeup": "「であろう」 is a formal expression used to convey a strong conjecture or probability. It is predominantly found in written language and highly formal speech, such as academic papers, news articles, and official announcements. This grammatical form implies a higher degree of certainty compared to its more casual counterpart, 「だろう」. Learners should understand that while both translate to \"probably\" or \"most likely,\" 「であろう」 carries a more authoritative and definitive tone. It is not typically heard in everyday conversations due to its elevated register. 「であろう」 can attach to verbs (in both dictionary and past forms), い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns, allowing for conjectures across various grammatical categories. Recognizing 「であろう」 is crucial for comprehending the nuanced level of certainty and formality in advanced Japanese texts and discourse.",
