meaning: Indicates an action or state that progresses towards the speaker or the present moment, or has
  continued from the past to the present.
meaning_warning: While てくる can indicate 'to come,' its primary function as a grammatical auxiliary goes
  beyond simple physical movement to include temporal progression, gradual change, or the completion of
  an action with implied return. Do not confuse it with the standalone verb くる (to come).

formation:
  '[Verb te-form] + くる': Indicates an action that happens and then moves towards the speaker's location,
    or a change/process that has developed or is occurring from the past until the present, or an action/state
    that has continued up to the present.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  usage-context: Used to describe actions or states that involve movement towards the speaker, a progression
    of time/change leading up to the present, or the start of a process.
  function: Indicates movement towards the speaker, continuation of an action/state from the past to the
    present, a gradual change, or the beginning of a process.
  nuance: The meaning of てくる often depends on the type of verb it attaches to. For verbs of movement,
    it implies coming. For verbs of change, it implies a process unfolding over time up to the present.
    For actions, it can imply continuation or return. It can convey a sense of arrival, accumulation of
    experience, or a gradual change unfolding over time until the present moment. Often implies that the
    result of the action is now visible or felt by the speaker.
  grammatical-role: Auxiliary Verb
  temporal-flow: Implies an action or change that began in the past and continues or culminates in the
    present.
etymology: The grammar point 「てくる」 is a compound form, combining the te-form of a verb with the verb 来る
  (くる), meaning "to come." The te-form serves to connect verbs, indicating a sequence of actions or a
  preceding state. In this construction, 来る adds a directional or temporal nuance. Historically, this
  combination evolved to describe an action that moves towards the speaker or a state that develops and
  approaches the present moment. It implies a trajectory from a point in the past or a distant location
  to the present moment or the speaker's location. This inherent directional meaning contrasts directly
  with 「〜ていく」, which uses 「行く (いく)」 (to go) to imply movement away or progression into the future. Over
  time, it evolved to express not just physical movement but also the commencement or continuation of
  actions and states, often with a sense of the action or state progressing towards the speaker's current
  position or the present moment in time.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point **てくる** functions as an auxiliary verb, attaching to the te-form of another verb. It primarily conveys three core meanings:

  1.  **Movement towards the speaker**: When combined with verbs of movement, **てくる** indicates that an action is performed, and then the subject moves towards the speaker or a reference point. For example, 「持って来る (motte kuru)」 means "to bring (something)" (literally, "to hold and come"), implying movement towards the speaker.

  2.  **Gradual change or process from past to present**: This is a very common usage where **てくる** signifies that a state or action has been developing or progressing over time, leading up to the present moment. It implies a continuous or gradual change. For instance, 「暖かくなって来た (atatakaku natte kita)」 means "it has become warm (gradually, over time)."

  3.  **Continuation or Accumulation**: **てくる** can indicate that an action or state has continued from the past up to the present moment, often with a sense of accumulated experience or sustained effort. For example, 「ずっと日本語を勉強してきた (zutto Nihongo o benkyou shite kita)」 means "I have been studying Japanese all along."

  4.  **Inceptive**: It can also indicate the beginning of a process or a change, where something "comes into being" or "comes into view." For example, 「空が暗くなってきた (sora ga kuraku natte kita)」 means "the sky started to get dark (it came to be dark).

  It is crucial to understand the distinction between **てくる** and its counterpart **ていく**. While **てくる** signifies movement or change *towards* the speaker/present, **ていく** signifies movement or change *away* from the speaker/present, or into the future. This fundamental difference in directionality is key to their proper use. While the kanji 来る is often used for the literal "come" meaning, the hiragana くる is frequently seen in the grammatical auxiliary sense, especially for changes over time.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜ていく
    meaning: Indicates movement away from the speaker or a progression of change away from the present/speaker's
      perspective.
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「てくる」 implies movement or change toward the speaker or the present moment, emphasizing arrival
      or culmination. In contrast, 「ていく」 implies movement or change away from the speaker or into the
      future, emphasizing departure or continuation into an unknown future.
    grammar_point: 〜ていく (change toward future・movement away from speaker)
  - term: くる
    meaning: To come
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「くる」 simply means "to come" as a verb of motion and does not inherently express a continuous
      action or a gradual change over time like 「てくる」. 「てくる」 implies a physical movement towards the speaker
      combined with an action, or a temporal progression/change leading to the present.
    grammar_point: くる (come)
  - term: になる・くなる (to become)
    meaning: To become
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜になる」 and 「〜くなる」 describe a direct change into a specific state, 「てくる」 implies a *gradual*
      process or change that has unfolded over time leading up to the present moment, emphasizing the
      progression and arrival of the new state.
    grammar_point: になる・くなる (to become)
  - term: '[Verb-stem]つづける (to continue doing)'
    meaning: To continue doing an action without interruption.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both imply continuation, 「つづける」 emphasizes an uninterrupted and possibly monotonous
      duration of an action. 「てくる」, when used for continuation, implies an action that has been ongoing
      up to the present, often with a sense of accumulation, development, or the result now being apparent.
      It suggests a process that has culminated rather than just endured.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]つづける (to continue doing)'
  - term: ばかりだ (only continues to)
    meaning: (Only) continue to, Keep on -ing, More and more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ばかりだ」 emphasizes that a situation is exclusively moving in one direction, often negatively,
      or that something is *only* continuing. 「てくる」, conversely, focuses on an emergence or a process
      of change that has developed up to the present, not necessarily an exclusively unidirectional trend.
    grammar_point: ばかりだ (only continues to)
  - term: '[Verb-stem]はじめる (to start doing)'
    meaning: To begin or start doing an action.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はじめる」 simply marks the initiation point of an action. 「てくる」, when used to describe a starting
      action (e.g., 「見えてくる」 - it comes into view), suggests that the beginning has already progressed
      to a state where it is now observable or affecting the present moment, implying a gradual unfolding
      rather than an instantaneous start.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]はじめる (to start doing)'
  - term: ようになる (to come to be)
    meaning: To reach the point that, To come to be that, To turn into
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「てくる」 and 「ようになる」 describe changes, 「てくる」 emphasizes the process of something developing
      and **arriving** at the present state or towards the speaker. In contrast, 「ようになる」 focuses more
      on the **resultant state** of becoming able to do something, acquiring a habit, or reaching a new
      condition.
    grammar_point: ようになる (to come to be)
  - term: '[Verb-stem]だす (to suddenly start doing)'
    meaning: To suddenly begin; to start doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「てくる」 (in its inceptive sense) and 「だす」 indicate the beginning of an action, 「だす」
      emphasizes a sudden or abrupt start, often from a state of inactivity. 「てくる」 can describe a more
      gradual or observable onset of a process that 'comes' into being.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]だす (to suddenly start doing)'
post_false_friends_writeup: The key distinction between **てくる** and these similar expressions lies in
  the implied direction and temporal focus. **てくる** consistently brings the action or change *towards*
  the speaker or the present moment, whether literally or figuratively. Other expressions may denote simple
  continuation, a change to a fixed state, or movement away, but they lack this inherent 'coming towards'
  aspect. When choosing between 「てくる」 and its similar expressions, consider the nuanced emphasis. If the
  action involves physical movement with a destination toward the speaker, or if a change has occurred
  over time and culminated in the present, 「てくる」 is usually the best fit. If the action is ongoing without
  a specific end in sight, or if it is moving away from the speaker, a different expression may be more
  appropriate. Pay close attention to the directionality and the temporal implications. Specifically,
  do not confuse 「てくる」 with 「ていく」; the former looks at change approaching the present, while the latter
  views it extending into the future. Likewise, 「はじめる」 or 「だす」 simply indicate a start, whereas 「てくる」
  implies a process that has begun and continued to develop towards the present, or has already reached
  the present. While 「ようになる」 focuses on the resultant state, 「てくる」 highlights the process of change arriving
  at the present, often gradually.

          - そろそろ 外 に {出かける} よ。
        english: I'm about to go out.

          that suggests leaving and coming back.

        english: Please buy a cake for Mom's birthday.
        hint: Simply using 買って (buy) does not convey the expectation of bringing the item back. We're
          looking for an instruction that includes both the act of buying and returning with the item.
    scene: A father asks his child to help prepare for their mother's birthday celebration.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female

    nuance: '「買ってきてください」 uses the te-form of 「てくる」 in a command form to imply two actions: buying the
      cake at a different location and then bringing it back to the speaker''s location. This nuance of
      ''perform an action elsewhere and return with the result'' is a key function of 「てくる」.'

        english: The package I was waiting for finally arrived.
        hint: 「届いた」 simply states that the package arrived. 「届いてきた」 emphasizes the movement of the package

    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「届いてきた」 emphasizes the physical movement of the package towards the speaker's location, implying
      it has come from somewhere else. It adds a sense of expectation being met as the item 'came to'
      them. This sentence is a self-reflection, often said aloud to oneself upon receiving the item.

        english: It suddenly became cold, didn't it?
        hint: While なりました simply states a change, it doesn't emphasize the gradual process from the past
          up to the present. We're looking for an expression that conveys a change that has developed
          over time.
    scene: Two colleagues exchange pleasantries as they meet in the office hallway on a chilly morning.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「寒くなってきました」 uses the auxiliary verb 「てくる」 to express a gradual change that has
      occurred over time and continued up to the present moment. It emphasizes the process of becoming
      cold, rather than a sudden, instantaneous shift. This usage is common for describing environmental
      changes in a polite, general way, suitable for both male and female speakers.

        english: This new project gradually took shape.
        hint: Using just なった (became) describes a completed change but doesn't convey the sense of a gradual
          process or development up to the present. We're looking for an expression that highlights the
          progression of the project's formation over time.

        english: When I'm with her, I somehow become uneasy.
        hint: While 落ち着かなくなる (become uneasy) describes the change of state, it doesn't express the nuance
          of a gradual, emerging feeling. We're looking for a phrase that conveys the subtle onset and
          development of an emotion.
    scene: A young man confides in a friend about his feelings when he's around a particular girl.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「落ち着かなく なって くる」 conveys a process where the feeling of uneasiness gradually arises
      and continues when the speaker is with the girl. This is a common way for male speakers to express
      emergent or developing emotions in a casual context, highlighting the subtle, progressive nature
      of the feeling. The male speech particle 「僕」 is used here.

        hint: While 「なった」 indicates a change, 「なってきた」 implies a gradual process of becoming understood
          over time. We're looking for an expression that conveys this progressive development of understanding.
    scene: A student proudly shares their progress with a friend.
    register: casual

    speaker_gender: female

        english: Since coming to Japan, I continuously studied Japanese.
        hint: Using just 勉強しました (studied) is a simple past tense and doesn't emphasize the ongoing or
          continuous nature of the action from a past point up to the present. We're looking for a nuance
          of sustained effort over time.
    scene: A student reflecting on their long-term efforts in learning Japanese since arriving in the
      country.
    register: formal
    setting: academic

    nuance: The use of 「勉強してきました」 emphasizes the ongoing nature of the Japanese study from a point in
      the past (coming to Japan) up until the present moment. It signifies a continuous process or accumulation
      of effort. This conveys dedication and sustained effort, and is appropriate for a female speaker
      reflecting on her accomplishments to an older male mentor.

        english: Even after a long time, the pain doesn't subside.
        hint: While 「引かない」 means the pain doesn't subside, 「引いてこない」 suggests that the pain hasn't decreased
          or receded over time, implying a lack of progressive improvement. We're looking for a phrase
          that expresses a persistent condition that hasn't changed or improved.

      "coming to be" this way. The casual register fits a conversation among friends. The use of 「きた」

post_example_writeup: As illustrated in the examples, **てくる** allows for expressing movement towards the
  speaker, a continuous action from the past to the present, or a gradual change. Paying close attention
  to the context and the preceding verb is essential for understanding the specific nuance being conveyed.
  When using 「くる」 to indicate a change, remember that the verb before 「くる」 should reflect the state that
  is being changed *to*. For example, if you want to say "It's starting to get cold," you should use 「寒く」
  (samuku), the adverbial form of 「寒い」 (samui), before 「なる」 to get 「寒く なっ て {き た}」 (samuku natte {kita}).
  The nuance of 「てくる」 often emphasizes that the change or action progresses towards the speaker's current
  time, place, or understanding, creating a sense of 'arrival' or accumulation.
