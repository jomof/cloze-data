    "formation": {
        "Verb (dictionary form) + べくして + Verb (same verb, various forms)": "Used to express that an event or outcome occurred, or will occur, exactly as expected or was destined to happen, typically due to prior circumstances or inherent nature. The verb before and after 「べくして」 is usually the same.",
        "する verbs": "The verb する typically transforms to すべくして (rather than するべくして)."

    "jlpt": "N1",
    "meaning": "As expected, meant to, supposed to, destined to, sure to",

        "Usage Context": "Rigid/Stiff (formal)"
    },
    "etymology": "べくして is derived from classical Japanese. 「べく」is the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」, indicating necessity or obligation. 「して」 is a conjunctive particle indicating a reason or cause. So, the phrase literally means \"because it should be,\" implying that something occurred because it was inevitable or predetermined.",
    "writeup": "「べくして」 is a formal expression combining 「べく」, the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」, and the conjunctive particle 「して」. It signifies that something happened as expected, due to logical reasons or a natural course of action. 「べく」 itself indicates the word it attaches to as a \"purpose\" or \"end goal.\"\n\n*   **Meaning**: Often translated as \"as expected of (A), (B)\" or \"as was supposed to (A), (B),\" where (A) and (B) are often the same verb repeated. The nuance suggests inevitability or destiny.\n*   **Register**: Quite formal, rarely heard in everyday speech.\n*   **Origin**: Derives from the kanji 「可」, meaning \"permissible\" or \"allowed,\" implying a situation certain to arise as the most logical course of events.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes the sustained, rigorous training as the direct, determining factor for their victory, making `べくして` the appropriate choice to convey that the win was an inevitable, almost fated consequence of their efforts, rather than just a natural or expected outcome."
