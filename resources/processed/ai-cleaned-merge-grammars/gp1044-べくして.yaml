    "etymology": "べくして is derived from 「べし」, an old auxiliary verb indicating obligation or suitability, combined with 「して」, a conjunctive particle indicating a reason or cause. The 「べし」 form evolved into 「べく」, which acts as an adverbial modifier, implying that something is 'as it should be' or 'as expected'.",
    "writeup": "べくして is a formal expression indicating that something happened as expected, was meant to be, or was destined to happen. It combines the conjunctive form べく of the classical auxiliary verb べし with the conjunctive particle して. べく indicates that the preceding verb is a 'purpose' or 'end goal'.\n\n*   This expression is **quite formal** and rarely used in daily conversation.\n*   It is often translated as \"as expected of (A), (B)\" or \"as was supposed to (A), (B),\" where (A) and (B) are often the same verb.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   The verb する takes the special form 「すべく」 or 「するべく」.\n*   This structure is related to other grammar patterns like べき and べし.",
