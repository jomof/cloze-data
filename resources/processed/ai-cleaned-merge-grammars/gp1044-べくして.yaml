    "etymology": "べくして is derived from classical Japanese. 「べく」is the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」, indicating necessity or obligation. 「して」 is a conjunctive particle indicating a reason or cause. So, the phrase literally means \"because it should be,\" implying that something occurred because it was inevitable or predetermined.",
    "writeup": "「べくして」 is a formal expression combining 「べく」, the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」, and the conjunctive particle 「して」. It signifies that something happened as expected, due to logical reasons or a natural course of action. 「べく」 itself indicates the word it attaches to as a \"purpose\" or \"end goal.\"\n\nIt is often translated as \"as expected of (A), (B)\" or \"as was supposed to (A), (B),\" where (A) and (B) are often the same verb repeated. The nuance suggests inevitability or destiny.\n\nThis expression is quite formal and is rarely heard in everyday speech.\n\nIts origin derives from the kanji 「可」 (ka), meaning \"permissible\" or \"allowed,\" implying a situation certain to arise as the most logical course of events.",
