    "etymology": "「どんな」 is derived from 「どのような」, meaning \"in what way\" or \"what kind of.\" The 「に」 turns it into an adverb, modifying the degree. 「ても」 indicates \"even if.\" Together, they create a structure expressing that even if something is a certain way, it doesn't change the outcome.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「どんなに〜ても」 expresses that no matter how much something is a certain way, it doesn't change a particular result or situation. It can be translated as \"no matter how (A), (B)\". 「どんなに」 modifies an adjective or verb, followed by 「ても」. For nouns and na-adjectives, use 「でも」 instead of 「ても」. This pattern emphasizes the extent to which something is true, but that it is still insufficient to alter the final outcome.",
