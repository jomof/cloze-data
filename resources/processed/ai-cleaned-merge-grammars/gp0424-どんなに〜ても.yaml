        "function": "To express that a certain state or action, regardless of its degree or intensity, does not change a subsequent outcome or condition.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes the extremeness of the preceding condition, highlighting that despite this extreme, the outcome remains unchanged. It conveys a sense of inevitability or unwavering resolve.",
        "colocation": "Often followed by expressions of inability, inevitability, strong will, or a contrasting outcome."
    },
    "etymology": "「どんな」 is a derivative of 「どのような」, meaning \"in what way\" or \"what kind of.\" The particle 「に」 functions as an adverbializer, modifying the degree or manner of what follows. 「ても」 is a concessive conjunctive particle, meaning \"even if\" or \"even though.\" Together, 「どんなに〜ても」 forms a fixed expression indicating that no matter the extent or degree of the preceding condition, the subsequent statement holds true, creating a sense of resignation or firm resolve.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「どんなに〜ても」 is used to express that a particular outcome or situation remains unchanged, regardless of the extreme extent or degree of a preceding condition. It can be translated as \"no matter how (A), (B)\".\n\nThis pattern typically connects an adverbial phrase (「どんなに」) to a verb, an い-adjective, a な-adjective, or a noun, followed by their respective concessive forms:\n\n*   **Verbs:** Attach 「ても」 to the て-form of the verb (e.g., 頑張る → 頑張っても).\n*   **い-adjectives:** Replace the final 「い」 with 「くても」 (e.g., 寒い → 寒くても).\n*   **な-adjectives:** Attach 「でも」 (e.g., 静か → 静かでも).\n*   **Nouns:** Attach 「でも」 (e.g., 天才 → 天才でも).\n\n「どんなに〜ても」 highlights the extremity of the initial condition, emphasizing that even with such an extreme, the result is consistent. This can convey resignation, determination, or a universal truth. It is broadly applicable across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal declarations.",
