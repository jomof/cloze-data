    "etymology": "「どんな」 is an abbreviation of 「どのような」, meaning \"in what way\" or \"what kind of.\" 「に」 turns it into an adverb. 「〜ても」 expresses \"even if.\" Thus, 「どんなに〜ても」 literally translates to \"even if (A) is in whatever way, (B).\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「どんなに〜ても」 expresses that a certain extent or degree is insufficient to change a particular outcome. It translates to \"no matter how (A), (B).\" 「どんなに」 is derived from 「どのような」 (what kind of) and is used to emphasize the degree. 「どんなに」 can be attached to any type of word, followed by 「でも」 (in the case of nouns or *na*-adjectives) or 「ても」 (in the case of *i*-adjectives or verbs).",
