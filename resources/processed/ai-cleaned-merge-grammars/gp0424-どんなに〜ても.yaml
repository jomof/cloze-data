    },
    "etymology": "「どんな」 is a derivative of 「どのような」, meaning \"in what way\" or \"what kind of.\" The particle 「に」 functions as an adverbializer, modifying the degree or manner of what follows. 「ても」 is a concessive conjunctive particle, meaning \"even if\" or \"even though.\" Together, 「どんなに〜ても」 forms a fixed expression indicating that no matter the extent or degree of the preceding condition, the subsequent statement holds true, creating a sense of resignation or firm resolve.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「どんなに〜ても」 is used to express that a particular outcome or situation remains unchanged, regardless of the extreme extent or degree of a preceding condition. It can be translated as \"no matter how (A), (B)\".\n\nThis pattern typically connects an adverbial phrase (「どんなに」) to a verb, an い-adjective, a な-adjective, or a noun, followed by their respective concessive forms:\n\n*   **Verbs:** Attach 「ても」 to the て-form of the verb (e.g., 頑張る → 頑張っても).\n*   **い-adjectives:** Replace the final 「い」 with 「くても」 (e.g., 寒い → 寒くても).\n*   **な-adjectives:** Attach 「でも」 (e.g., 静か → 静かでも).\n*   **Nouns:** Attach 「でも」 (e.g., 天才 → 天才でも).\n\n「どんなに〜ても」 highlights the extremity of the initial condition, emphasizing that even with such an extreme, the result is consistent. This can convey resignation, determination, or a universal truth. It is broadly applicable across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal declarations.",

It directly focuses on the constraint or impossibility of an action, whereas 「どんなに〜ても」 acknowledges the extent of a condition without directly focusing on ability or inability, instead emphasizing the unchanging outcome despite that condition."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「いくら〜でも」, 「どうしても」, 「にしても」, and 「にも〜ない」 can sometimes be used in similar contexts, it's important to remember that 「どんなに〜ても」 specifically emphasizes the *degree* to which something is true, but it still doesn't change the outcome. Choosing the right expression depends on the specific nuance you want to convey. For example, if you want to stress the sheer magnitude of a condition, 「どんなに〜ても」 is often the most suitable choice.",
