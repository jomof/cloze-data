formation:
  '[Noun (reason/cause)] + で': Indicates the reason or cause for an event or state. This is typically
    used for objective, factual reasons.
  '[Noun (means/tool)] + で': Indicates the means or method by which an action is performed, or the material
    something is made of.
  '[Location] + で': Indicates the location where an action or event takes place, highlighting the scope
    or boundary of the action. While not a 'cause', it's a fundamental use of で related to its original
    function as a locative particle derived from the te-form of だ/です, marking the state of 'being at'
    or 'by means of' a location for an action to occur.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  particle-syntactic-function: causal
  function: Indicates the reason, cause, or means by which something occurs.
  nuance: Implies a more direct or objective causal relationship than から or ので. It cannot be used to express
    a request or suggestion.
  grammatical-role: adverbial
  logical-flow: cause-effect
  temporal-flow: cause precedes effect
  spatial-flow: locative (for action/event location)
etymology: The particle で used to indicate reason or cause is believed to have originated from the て form
  of the copula です. This evolution suggests a progression from describing a state or condition to indicating
  that the state is the cause of a subsequent event or situation. Its function as a particle indicating
  means or location of action also stems from this root, signifying 'being at' or 'by means of' a noun.
writeup: 'The particle で serves to indicate a reason, cause, or the means by which something happens.
  It functions as a direct and objective connector, often translatable as "because of," "due to," or "by
  means of." This contrasts with other causal particles like から or ので, which tend to introduce more subjective
  or softer explanations. で is typically used when the cause is a concrete noun or noun phrase, leading
  to a factual consequence. For instance, explaining why an event was cancelled, or how an object was
  created. It strictly connects objective facts. For example, 「雨で」 (due to rain) implies the rain is a
  direct, observable cause. Another common use of で is to mark the location where an action takes place,
  as in 「図書館で勉強します」 (I study at the library). This function highlights the context or setting of an action.
  Important Considerations: * で cannot be used to express requests or suggestions. Its role is solely
  to state a cause or method. For expressions of intent or softened reasons that might lead to a request,
  から or ので are more appropriate. * It connects a noun or noun phrase directly to the resulting action
  or state. * The nuance of で is straightforward and factual, making it suitable for clear, concise statements.
  * This grammar point is versatile and does not carry gender or age-specific connotations, making it
  appropriate for all speakers in various contexts.'

post_false_friends_writeup: Remember, で is for objective explanations of *why* something happened, and
  is less flexible in sentence structure than から or ので. Avoid using で for requests. And don't confuse
  it with と, which is entirely different in its function.

          would imply something more like a formal method or even the train being an agent of action.
          So, we're looking for the use of the 「で」 particle to express the means of transportation.

          - 日本 語 にて 話し ましょ う。
          - 日本 語 を もっ て 話し ましょ う。
        english: Let's speak in Japanese (formal/written style).
        hint: 「にて」 and 「をもって」 are more formal or literary alternatives for indicating means. We're looking
          for the common, everyday particle for 'by means of language'. We're looking for the use of the
          「で」 particle to express the means.

          - 日本 語 を 使っ て 話し ましょ う。
        english: Let's speak using Japanese.
        hint: 「を使って」 emphasizes the action of 'using' the language. We're looking for the particle that
          directly indicates the medium of communication, not an explicit action. We're looking for the
          use of the 「で」 particle to express the means.
    scene: A teacher encouraging students to use the target language.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: 「日本語で」 indicates the language 「日本語」 as the means or medium of communication 「話しましょう」, showing
      the objective method. This is a standard way to specify the language being used in an instructional
      setting.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 は 東京 から 開か れ ます。
        english: The meeting will be opened from Tokyo.
        hint: 「から」 indicates origin. We're looking for the location where the meeting takes place, not
          its origin. We're looking for the use of the 「で」 particle to express the location of an action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 は 東京 に 開か れ ます。
        english: The meeting will be held to Tokyo (awkward).
        hint: 「に」 indicates direction or exact point, but not the location where an action takes place.
          We're looking for the location where the meeting takes place. We're looking for the use of the
          「で」 particle to express the location of an action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 は 東京 な の で 開か れ ます。
        english: Because it's Tokyo, the meeting will be held.
        hint: 「なので」 indicates a reason. We're looking for the location where the meeting takes place,
          not a reason. We're looking for the use of the 「で」 particle to express the location of an action.
    scene: An event coordinator informing participants about the meeting venue.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「東京で」 clearly marks Tokyo 「東京」 as the location where the action of holding the meeting 「開かれます」
      occurs. This is a fundamental use of で for indicating the place of an event.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「で」 consistently serves to provide an objective cause
  or means, as well as the location of an action. Whether it's a reason for an event, the material used
  for an object, the method used for an action, or the physical space where something occurs, 「で」 offers
  a straightforward and factual connection. Pay attention to the types of nouns used before 「で」; these
  are often concrete reasons, materials, instruments, or locations, reinforcing its objective nature.
