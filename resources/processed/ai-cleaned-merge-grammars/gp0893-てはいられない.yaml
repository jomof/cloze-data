    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the て form of a verb + は (topic marker) + いられない (the potential negative form of いる, 'to be'). Literally, it means 'cannot continue being in the state of doing [verb].' Over time, this has evolved to mean 'cannot afford to' or 'unable to' in the context of the verb it modifies.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「てはいられない」 consists of the te-form of a verb, the particle 「は」, and the negative potential form of the verb 「いる」 (to be), which is 「いられない」. It expresses the idea that one **cannot afford** to do something or that one is **unable** to continue in a certain state. The casual form, 「ちゃいられない」 or 「じゃいられない」, is also common. This structure often implies a sense of urgency or necessity, suggesting that there are reasons preventing the action from continuing. It can also express a feeling of not being able to tolerate a certain situation. The nuance is often '(A) cannot continue due to (B)', with (B) being the mentioned reason.",
