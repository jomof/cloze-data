    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てはいられない」 is constructed from 「ては」 (a conditional particle indicating a hypothetical situation) and 「いられない」 (the potential negative form of 「いる」, meaning 'to be'). Thus, the literal sense is akin to 'if one were to continue doing something, it cannot be'.",
    "writeup": "「てはいられない」 expresses the idea that one cannot afford to do something, or is unable to continue a certain state or action. It implies a sense of urgency or necessity to change the current situation. It conveys a sense that a certain verb's action cannot continue due to some external factor such as time constraints or a feeling of being limited.\n\nThis structure is almost exclusively seen with verbs, but may occasionally be seen with い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns as well. When appearing with い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns, the nuance changes slightly; it simply reflects the meaning of いられない itself in conveying that (A) 'cannot be', or is 'impossible' in some way. In these cases, 「ては」 will be replaced by 「では」 for nouns and な-adjectives.\n\nIt often has the nuance of '(A) cannot continue due to (B)', with the reason of (B) being mentioned in another part of the sentence. Common translations include \"can't afford to\" or \"unable to.\"",
