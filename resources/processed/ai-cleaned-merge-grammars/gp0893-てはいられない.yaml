    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てはいられない」 is constructed from 「ては」 (a conditional particle indicating a hypothetical situation) and 「いられない」 (the potential negative form of 「いる」, meaning 'to be'). Thus, the literal sense is akin to 'if one were to continue doing something, it cannot be'.",
    "writeup": "「てはいられない」 expresses the idea that one cannot afford to do something, or is unable to continue a certain state or action. It implies a sense of urgency or necessity to change the current situation. It conveys a sense that a certain verb's action cannot continue due to some external factor such as time constraints or a feeling of being limited.\n\n*   Common translations include \"can't afford to\" or \"unable to.\"\n*   It is typically used with verbs, but can occasionally be found with い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns. When used with adjectives or nouns, 「ではいられない」 is used.",
