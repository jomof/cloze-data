jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express that a state has continued unchanged since a certain action, or to emphasize
    that only a limited amount or single item exists/happened. Often implies a slight regret, surprise,
    or a simple factual statement of limitation.
  function: Indicates a persistent state or a strict limitation.
  nuance: Implies a sense of 'nothing else happened' or 'only that much.' It can carry a nuance of slight
    disappointment, surprise, or simply a matter-of-fact statement, depending on context.
  grammatical-role: Functions similarly to a particle or auxiliary, modifying verbs or nouns.
etymology: The colloquial suffix 「っきり」 is a shortened and somewhat emphatic form of 「きり」. Both trace back
  to the concept of 「切る」 (kiru), meaning 'to cut' or 'to finish completely'. This origin suggests a 'cutting
  off' or 'limiting' of subsequent actions or quantities. Therefore, when you say 「〜たっきり」, it's as if
  the action 'cuts off' any further developments, leaving the situation as it is. Similarly, 「〜っきり」 with
  a noun 'cuts off' any other possibilities, leaving only that specific item or quantity.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「〜っきり」 is a versatile, colloquial expression primarily used to convey two main ideas: **that a state has remained unchanged since a particular action**, or **that something is limited to 'only' a certain amount or instance.**

  When attached to the **past tense (た-form) of a verb**, 「〜たっきり」 signifies that an action occurred, and ever since, nothing else has happened, or the situation has remained as it was right after that action. This often carries a subtle nuance of surprise, disappointment, or a simple factual statement that contrasts with what one might expect. For example, if someone says 「彼は行ってきりだ」 (Kare wa itta kkiri da), it means "He went and hasn't come back since." This implies a sustained state of absence following his departure.

  When attached to a **noun**, 「〜っきり」 functions similarly to 「だけ」 (dake) or 「きり」 (kiri), meaning "only" or "just." It emphasizes the exclusivity or limitation of something. For instance, 「一人っきり」 (hitori kkiri) means "just one person" or "all alone." This usage highlights that there is nothing else beyond the specified noun.

  It's important to remember that 「〜っきり」 is quite **casual and colloquial**, making it suitable for informal conversations but less appropriate for formal writing or speech. Its usage can sometimes imply a certain level of familiarity or intimacy between speakers.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜きり (only・just)
    meaning: only; just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜きり」 is a slightly more formal or less emphatic version of 「〜っきり」 when used with nouns. When
      used with verbs (e.g., Verb[た-form] + きり), it conveys a similar 'since... and nothing else' meaning,
      but 「〜っきり」 often carries a stronger sense of colloquialism or personal feeling.
    grammar_point: 〜きり (only・just)
  - term: ばかり (only・just, often with nuance of excess)
    meaning: only; just; nothing but; (just) finished doing
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both can mean 'only,' 「〜ばかり」 often implies a larger quantity or an excessive amount,
      or that something *just* happened. For example, 「ご飯ばかり食べる」 (gohan bakari taberu) means 'eats nothing
      but rice' (implying excess), whereas 「ご飯っきり食べる」 is less natural and would imply 'only ate rice (and
      nothing else since)'. We're looking for an expression that signifies a sustained state or strict
      limitation.
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・just, often with nuance of excess)
  - term: だけ (only・just)
    meaning: only; just; as much as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜だけ」 is a neutral and common way to express 'only' or 'just'. It lacks the subtle implications
      of 'since then, nothing else' found in 「〜たっきり」, or the colloquial emphasis of 「〜っきり」 with nouns.
      It simply states a limitation without additional nuance. We're looking for an expression with a
      more specific, sometimes emotional, nuance of limitation or sustained state.
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: 以来 (since・ever since)
    meaning: since; ever since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「以来」 is a more formal expression indicating 'since' a certain point in time, often used for
      longer periods or more significant events. It focuses purely on the temporal aspect of 'since' and
      doesn't carry the colloquial or 'nothing else has happened' nuance as strongly as 「〜たっきり」. We're
      looking for a colloquial way to say 'since, and still in that state'.
    grammar_point: 以来 (since・ever since)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「〜っきり」 from similar expressions like 「〜きり」, 「〜ばかり」, and
  「〜だけ」, consider the specific nuance. 「〜っきり」 has a strong colloquial flavor and often implies a lack
  of subsequent action or a definitive, sometimes surprising, limitation. 「〜きり」 is very close but can
  be slightly less emphatic or colloquial. 「〜ばかり」 can also mean 'only', but often suggests an excessive
  amount or a recently completed action. 「〜だけ」 is the most neutral and straightforward way to say 'only'.
  For 'since' contexts, 「以来」 is more formal and primarily temporal, while 「〜たっきり」 adds the nuance of an
  unchanged state.
examples:
  - english: He went to the convenience store and hasn't come back since.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は コンビニ へ {行っ た っきり}、戻っ て き て ない ね。
      - 彼 は コンビニ へ {行っ た っきり}、帰っ て 来 ませ ん よ。
    english_literally: As for him, he went to the convenience store and hasn't returned.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は コンビニ へ 行っ た まま だ ね。
          - 彼 は コンビニ へ 行っ た まま で いる よ。
        english: He went to the convenience store and is still in that state.
        hint: 「〜まま」 indicates 'as is' or 'in that state,' but doesn't necessarily imply a lack of further
          action or a 'since then, nothing else' nuance. We're looking for 'since then, nothing has changed'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は コンビニ へ 行っ た きり だ よ。
          - 彼 は コンビニ へ 行っ た きり 帰っ て 来 ない よ。
        english: He went to the convenience store and hasn't come back.
        hint: 「〜きり」 is very similar, but 「〜っきり」 adds a stronger colloquial tone and sometimes a nuance
          of slight surprise or disappointment. We're looking for the more casual and possibly emphatic
          form.
    scene: A mother is wondering where her son has gone.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The mother uses 「行ったっきり」 to express her slight frustration or worry that her son left for
      the convenience store and has not returned, implying a continuous state of absence. The casual tone
      is reinforced by 「〜ね」.
  - english: She only said goodbye once and left.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は さよなら を {言っ た っきり}、行っ て しまっ た。
      - 彼女 は さよなら {言っ た っきり} で、行っ ちゃっ た。

          - 彼女 は さよなら を 一 度 だけ 言っ て、行っ て しまっ た。
        english: She only said goodbye once and left.
        hint: 「だけ」 is a neutral 'only'. Here, we want to convey that the act of saying goodbye was the
          *only* thing done before leaving, implying a quick, perhaps abrupt, departure. We're looking
          for a nuance of a singular action followed by departure.
    scene: Narrating a somewhat sad or abrupt departure.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「言ったっきり」 emphasizes that her saying goodbye was the sole action before leaving, suggesting
      an abrupt or minimal interaction. This highlights the finality of the action and the immediate subsequent
      departure without further interaction.
  - english: I heard he moved to Hokkaido, but I haven't heard from him since then.
    japanese:

        english: I heard he moved to Hokkaido, but since then, there has been no contact.
        hint: While 「〜まま」 can express a continued state, 「〜っきり」 is more suited to expressing that a specific
          situation (lack of contact) has persisted since a past event. We're looking for a colloquial
          'since then, nothing'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼、北海道 へ 引っ越し た って 聞い た けど、それ 以来 連絡 が ない よ。
        english: I heard he moved to Hokkaido, but since then, there has been no contact.
        hint: 「以来」 is a more formal 'since then', primarily focusing on the passage of time from an event.
          「〜っきり」 provides a more casual and personal 'since then, and nothing else has changed' nuance.
          We're looking for a casual way to express a continued lack of contact.
    scene: Two friends catching up and discussing a mutual acquaintance.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「連絡ないっきり」 (renraku nai kkiri) explicitly states that contact ceased after he moved and has
      not resumed, conveying a sense of being cut off. The casual 'って' and 'だよ' reinforce the informal
      setting.

        english: This morning, because I only ate one piece of bread, my stomach is already rumbling.
        hint: 「だけ」 is neutral. 「しか〜ない」 emphasizes scarcity. 「〜っきり」 here emphasizes the *minimal* amount,
          often with a slight implication of 'that's all there was/that's all I managed' before something
          else happened (like getting hungry). We're looking for a specific emphasis on the small quantity.
    scene: Someone complaining about being hungry after a meager breakfast.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    nuance: 「一つっきり」 emphasizes the mere single piece of bread eaten, making the hunger seem more profound
      or humorous due to the minimal intake. 「ぺこぺこだよ」 reinforces the casual and slightly exaggerated complaint.
  - english: My grandfather passed away 20 years ago, and my grandmother has been living alone since then.

        english: My grandfather passed away 20 years ago, and my grandmother has been living alone ever
          since.
        hint: 「以来」 is suitable here for a long-term 'since'. However, 「〜たっきり」 specifically highlights
          the continuous state (living alone) that began at that point and has remained unchanged, with
          a slightly more personal or empathetic nuance. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes
          the unchanged state since an event.
    scene: Discussing family history.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: While the overall sentence is formal due to 「〜です」, 「亡くなったっきり」 maintains a direct connection
      to the event of death as the point from which her grandmother's solitary life continuously stems,
      conveying a sustained, poignant state. The grammar is used in a slightly more formal context here,
      showing its flexibility though its core meaning remains colloquial.

        english: The cat is on the roof / The cat went onto the roof and is still there.
        hint: 「〜ている」 indicates a continuous state. 「〜まま」 means 'as is'. 「〜たっきり」 specifically means 'since

          the roof. We're looking for the nuance of 'it went up and stayed up there'.

        english: As for him, since he came to Japan, he seems to have no money.
        hint: 「来てから」 simply states 'since coming'. 「来たっきり」 implies that *after* arriving, the state of
          'having no money' has persisted, often highlighting a sudden or unexpected lack of funds upon
          arrival. We're looking for the specific nuance that the lack of money is a continuous state
          since his arrival.
    scene: Gossiping about a new arrival.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)

        english: As for him, because he is only one person, he is a bit of a spoiled child.

          'all alone' or 'the only one', often carrying a slightly empathetic or explanatory nuance for
          their personality trait. We're looking for a specific emphasis on being 'the only one'.
    scene: Explaining someone's personality trait due to family structure.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「一人っきり」 emphasizes his status as an only child, implying that his 'spoiled' nature is a direct
      consequence of this singular upbringing. The phrasing is explanatory rather than judgmental.

    japanese:
      - これ {一 個 っきり} 買い まし た。
      - これ {一 個 っきり} 買っ た よ。

    english_literally: I bought only this one piece.

      - competing_japanese:
          - これ 一 個 だけ 買い まし た。
          - これ 一 個 しか 買い ませ ん でし た。
        english: I bought only this one piece.
        hint: 「だけ」 is neutral, 「しか〜ない」 emphasizes scarcity. 「一個っきり」 emphasizes that *only* this single
          item was purchased, cutting off any other purchases. We're looking for an emphatic statement
          of buying only one item.
    scene: Showing a single purchase to someone.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「一個っきり」 highlights that only one item was bought, leaving no room for other purchases. The
      polite 「買いました」 maintains the formal setting despite the casual feel of 「〜っきり」, showing how it can
      be integrated.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「〜っきり」 functions in both its 'since... no change' verbal
  form and its 'only' nominal form. Notice how it often carries an implicit sense of a state having been
  fixed since a certain point, or a quantity being strictly limited. Its colloquial nature makes it a
  natural fit for everyday conversations, adding a touch of casual emphasis or subtle emotion that more
  formal equivalents might lack.
