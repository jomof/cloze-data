details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Stiff/Formal
  function: To indicate that a subsequent action or decision is made after a preceding action, consideration,
    or process has been completed. It implies a deliberate, often important, prerequisite step.
  nuance: Implies a logical progression or a necessary prerequisite. The first action is often a foundational
    step for the second, suggesting a thoughtful or deliberate process. It carries a more formal and official
    tone than simple temporal connectors.
  grammatical-role: Conjunctive phrase
  logical-flow: Action A (prerequisite) → Action B (consequence of A)
  temporal-flow: A must complete before B
  spatial-flow: Not applicable
etymology: The grammar point 「上で」 is derived from 「上」 (ue), meaning "above" or "on," and 「で」 (de), which
  can indicate means or condition. Literally, it can be understood as "with the above/previous," implying
  that something is done based on a prior action or consideration. The use of 「で」 as a case-marking particle
  highlights the conditional nature of the construction.
writeup: 「上で」 is an expression used to indicate that an action or decision (B) is made *after* a prior
  action or consideration (A) has been completed. It's akin to saying "upon (A)" or "after (A), (B)."
  This grammar point suggests a **logical progression** where A serves as a necessary prerequisite or
  a foundational step for B. It carries a formal and somewhat official tone, making it more common in
  written Japanese, official statements, or polite conversation rather than casual speech.When used with
  verbs, 「上で」 attaches to the plain past form (e.g., 読んだ上で). When used with nouns, it attaches as 「名詞の上で」
  (e.g., 調査の上で).The action or consideration before 「上で」 is typically a deliberate, crucial step that forms
  the basis for the subsequent action. It's not just a simple sequence of events, but rather a dependency.This
  expression leans towards formal or semi-formal contexts. While it can be understood in casual settings,
  other simpler expressions like 「てから」 or 「あとで」 are more common for mere chronological sequence.A key
  restriction of 「上で」 is that the verb preceding it cannot be in the passive voice. This is because 「上で」
  implies a deliberate, controlled action or consideration (A) that leads to (B). Passive verbs often
  denote a lack of agency or control over the action, which conflicts with the intentionality conveyed
  by 「上で」.

  - term: てから
    meaning: after; since; once (something is done)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てから」 simply indicates a sequence of events. Unlike 「上で」, it doesn't necessarily imply a logical
      connection or prerequisite between the two actions, or the deliberate nature of the preceding action.
    grammar_point: てから (after and since)
  - term: 上に
    meaning: in addition to; as well as; besides
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「上に」 adds information, meaning 'in addition to' or 'as well as'; it doesn't show a sequential
      dependency or a prerequisite. Unlike 「上で」, which implies a condition for a subsequent action, 「上に」
      presents supplemental details.
    grammar_point: 上に (in addition to)
  - term: たら
    meaning: if; when
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たら」 introduces a conditional clause or a simple temporal consequence. Unlike 「上で」, which
      requires the first action to be completed as a basis, 「たら」 can describe a hypothetical situation
      or a more casual cause-and-effect.
    grammar_point: たら (conditional, when・if A then B)
  - term: あとで
    meaning: later; afterwards
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あとで」 merely indicates temporal succession. Unlike 「上で」, it does not necessarily establish
      a prior condition or basis for the second action, merely a temporal order.
    grammar_point: あとで (after・later)
  - term: た末・の末
    meaning: after; as a conclusion of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「た末・の末」 emphasizes the culmination of a long process or effort, often implying a final outcome
      or consequence after considerable difficulty or deliberation. Unlike 「上で」, 「た末・の末」 often carries
      a stronger sense of finality or result after a prolonged effort.
    grammar_point: た末・の末 (after a process)
  - term: て初めて
    meaning: only after; not until
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「て初めて」 highlights a realization, discovery, or new state that was achieved *only* after a
      particular action or experience. Unlike 「上で」, it emphasizes the change in understanding or ability
      resulting from the action, rather than the action being a deliberate prerequisite for a subsequent
      planned action.
    grammar_point: て初めて (for the first time after)
  - term: にもとづいて
    meaning: based on; in accordance with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にもとづいて」 indicates that something is done *based on* a rule, fact, principle, or data, acting
      as a foundation or criterion. In contrast, 「上で」 indicates an action is taken *after* a preceding
      action or consideration has been completed and serves as a deliberate prerequisite. The emphasis
      is on the source of the basis (`にもとづいて`) versus the act of using a prior step as a foundation (`上で`).
    grammar_point: にもとづいて (based on)
  - term: を経て
    meaning: via; through; after (experience, time, etc.); having gone through
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「を経て」 focuses on the process of *going through* a period, experience, or route to reach a
      certain state or outcome. While it implies succession like 「上で」, it emphasizes the *passage* and
      *experience* rather than a deliberate, foundational action or consideration that serves as a direct
      prerequisite for the next step.
    grammar_point: を経て (after process or experience)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「上で」 signifies that an action or consideration
  directly influences the subsequent action, serving as its deliberate foundation. While 「てから」 and 「あとで」
  indicate simple sequence, 「上に」 adds information, and 「たら」 sets a condition. 「た末・の末」 suggests a final
  outcome after a long process, and 「て初めて」 emphasizes a realization or new understanding that occurs only
  after an action. Furthermore, 「に基づいて」 specifies that an action is based on rules or information, and
  「を経て」 focuses on the experience of going through a process.

post_example_writeup: When using 「上で」, it's essential to ensure that the first action logically precedes
  the second. The first action often serves as a foundation or necessary step for the subsequent action.
  It's a more formal way of indicating sequential actions compared to expressions like 「てから」. Also, be
  mindful of the restriction against passive verbs before 「上で」.
