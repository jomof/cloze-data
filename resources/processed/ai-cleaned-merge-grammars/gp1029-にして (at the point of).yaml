    "etymology": "にして is derived from the particle に combined with the て-form of the verb する (to do). The に marks a specific point or condition, and する in this context implies 'becoming' or 'reaching' that point. Thus, にして signifies that something happens *at* the moment of reaching that point, often implying surprise or significance.",
    "writeup": "にして is used to express that something happens **at** or **after** a certain point or stage, often implying that the event is surprising or noteworthy. It combines the particle に with the te-form of する. It commonly appears after counters, nouns, or time expressions, marking a specific instance from which something significant occurs. It is often followed by adverbs or grammar patterns like ようやく or 初めて to emphasize the importance of the moment.",
