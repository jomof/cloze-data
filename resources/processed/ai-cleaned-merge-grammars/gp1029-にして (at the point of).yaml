    "etymology": "にして is derived from the particle に combined with the て-form of the verb する (to do). The に marks a specific point or condition, and する in this context implies 'becoming' or 'reaching' that point. Thus, にして signifies that something happens *at* the moment of reaching that point, often implying surprise or significance.",
    "writeup": "にして is used to express that something happens **at** or **after** a certain point or stage, often implying that the event is surprising, noteworthy, or represents a significant milestone. It combines the particle に with the te-form of する, signifying a state or condition that has been reached or accepted as fact, from which a new situation emerges. This expression frequently follows counters, nouns, or time expressions, marking the specific instance as a critical juncture. It can suggest that the point in question is of a high standard or a prime example, and the subsequent event either aligns with or deviates from expectations for such a point. To further emphasize the importance or unexpectedness of the moment, にして is often followed by adverbs or grammar patterns such as ようやく (finally) or 初めて (for the first time). This expression carries a somewhat formal or literary tone and is commonly encountered in formal writing and speech.",
