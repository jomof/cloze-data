    "etymology": "にして is derived from the particle に combined with the te-form of the verb する (to do). The に marks a specific point or condition, and the する emphasizes that something is decided or accepted at that point, leading to a new state or realization.",
    "writeup": "にして indicates that something surprising or significant happens at a specific point in time, age, or after a certain number of attempts. It often emphasizes that something is achieved or realized only after reaching a certain level or point. It can follow counters or nouns, marking the preceding element as a noteworthy instance. What follows にして typically describes something that either fulfills or defies expectations associated with that instance. You'll often see it followed by adverbs like ようやく (finally) or 初めて (for the first time) to further emphasize the significance of the moment. This grammar point is often used in formal speech and writing.",
