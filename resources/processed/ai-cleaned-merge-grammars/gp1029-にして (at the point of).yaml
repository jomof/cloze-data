        "function": "To mark a specific point, often a high level or a prime example, at which something noteworthy, surprising, or unexpected occurs or is realized.",
        "nuance": "This expression conveys a sense of unexpectedness or significance regarding the timing or condition of an event. It highlights that an action or state occurs 'at' or 'after' a particular point that is often considered a high achievement, a critical juncture, or a surprisingly late or early stage. It implies that the subsequent event either aligns with or deviates from the expectations associated with that specific point.",
        "source": "bunpro, dojg"
    },
    "etymology": "「にして」 is derived from the particle 「に」 combined with the て-form of the verb 「する」 (to do). The 「に」 marks a specific point or condition, and 「する」 in this context implies 'becoming' or 'reaching' that point. Thus, 「にして」 signifies that something happens *at* the moment of reaching that point, often implying surprise, significance, or an unexpected outcome.",
    "writeup": "「にして」 is used to express that something happens **at** or **after** a certain point or stage, often implying that the event is surprising, noteworthy, or represents a significant milestone. It combines the particle 「に」 with the te-form of 「する」, signifying a state or condition that has been reached or accepted as fact, from which a new situation emerges. This expression frequently follows counters, nouns, time expressions, or the 「ながら」 form of verbs, marking the specific instance as a critical juncture. It can suggest that the point in question is of a high standard or a prime example, and the subsequent event either aligns with or deviates from expectations for such a point. To further emphasize the importance or unexpectedness of the moment, 「にして」 is often followed by adverbs or grammar patterns such as 「ようやく」 (finally) or 「初めて」 (for the first time). This expression carries a somewhat formal or literary tone and is commonly encountered in formal writing and speech.",
