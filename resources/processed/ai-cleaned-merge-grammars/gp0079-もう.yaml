    "etymology": "The word 「もう」 originally comes from the verb 「燃ゆ (moyu)」, meaning \"to burn\". Over time, it evolved to express the idea of something having reached its end or limit, similar to how a fire eventually burns out. This sense of completion or cessation led to its modern meanings of \"already\" and \"anymore.\"",
    "writeup": "「もう」 is generally translated as \"already\" or \"anymore,\" depending on the context. It conveys the idea that something has unexpectedly ended. Literally, 「もう」 means \"something has unexpectedly ended\".\n\n*   In a past-tense affirmative sentence, it means something is already completed, contrary to expectation, thus \"already\".\n*   In a negative sentence, it means something expected to continue has stopped, thus \"anymore\".\n\n「もう」 can also be used in questions to confirm if something might have ended. It expresses exasperation or giving up, indicating a desire to end a discussion or situation.",
