    "etymology": "The word 「もう」 originally meant \"again\" or \"more.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the idea of something being completed or no longer continuing, hence its meanings of \"already\" and \"anymore.\"",
    "writeup": "「もう」 is a versatile word that primarily translates to \"already\" in affirmative sentences and \"anymore\" in negative sentences. The core meaning stems from the idea that something has unexpectedly ended or reached a conclusion.\n\n*   In past tense affirmative sentences, 「もう」 indicates that an action has been completed sooner than expected, hence \"already.\"\n*   In negative sentences, 「もう」 signifies that a state or action that was expected to continue has ceased, hence \"anymore.\"\n*   「もう」 can also be used in questions to confirm if something has already happened, implying the speaker suspects it might have.\n\nWhile 「もう」 can be used across various registers, its directness often lends itself to casual conversations. However, it is also perfectly acceptable in formal speech when paired with polite verb forms. It can also be used as an expression of exasperation or giving up, implying a state of being at one's limit, as in 「もう無理」 (mou muri - I can't anymore).",
