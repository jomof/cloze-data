meaning: That much; to that extent; so much; such a great amount or degree, often expressing surprise
  or emphasis.
pronunciation:
  katakana: アンナニ
  romaji: annani
formation:
  あんなに + Verb/い-Adjective/な-Adjective/Adverb: Modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb to express
    a large degree or extent.
jlpt: N5
etymology: あんなに is derived from the demonstrative series あ- (as in あの, あそこ, あれ), which indicates something
  physically or psychologically distant from both the speaker and the listener. The な part is a nominalizing
  particle (similar to こんな, そんな, どんな), and に is a particle indicating degree or manner, forming an adverb.
  Thus, あんなに literally means "in such a manner/degree as that (over there)." It highlights the degree
  or extent of something observed or recalled.
writeup: あんなに is an adverb used to express a large degree, extent, or quantity of something, often implying
  surprise, emphasis, or even a sense of being overwhelmed. It belongs to the "あ" (a) series of demonstratives,
  which refers to things physically or psychologically distant from both the speaker and the listener,
  or something that is generally known or understood, not necessarily immediately present. While its literal
  meaning points to "that much over there," it's more commonly used to convey "so much" or "to such an
  extent" when referring to something previously mentioned or understood, or when expressing a strong
  feeling about something's magnitude. It can modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
false_friends:
  - term: こんなに
    meaning: This much; to this extent; so much (near speaker)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike あんなに, こんなに refers to a degree or amount close to the speaker, implying "this much"
      or "to this extent" (e.g., "this much (like what I'm experiencing now)").
    grammar_point: <suggest>:こんなに (this much・to this extent)
  - term: そんなに
    meaning: That much; to that extent; so much (near listener)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike あんなに, そんなに refers to a degree or amount close to the listener, implying "that much"
      or "to that extent" (e.g., "that much (like what you're experiencing)").
    grammar_point: <suggest>:そんなに (that much・to that extent)
  - term: どんなに
    meaning: How much; to what extent
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike あんなに, どんなに is used to ask about the degree or extent, or to express "no matter how
      much/how."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どんなに (how much・to what extent)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key to distinguishing こんなに, そんなに, あんなに, and どんなに lies in the basic principles
  of the こ・そ・あ・ど demonstrative series. こんなに refers to something near the speaker, そんなに to something near
  the listener, and あんなに to something far from both, or something generally acknowledged. どんなに is the
  interrogative form, asking about the degree. Understanding these spatial and interrogative distinctions
  will help you choose the correct adverb.

        english: I didn't think it would be that much fun (referring to something the listener knows well).
        hint: Use 「あんなに」 when referring to something distant or generally understood, not something primarily
          associated with the listener. We're looking for a general surprise.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 夕焼け は とても 綺麗 だっ た。
        english: The sunset was very beautiful.
        hint: 「とても」 emphasizes 'very', but 「あんなに」 adds a nuance of 'to such an amazing extent' or 'like
          that (unforgettable)'. We're looking for emphasis on an observed, remarkable degree.
    scene: Two friends are reminiscing about a trip.
    register: casual

          - 試験 に たくさん 勉強 し て 気分 が 悪く なっ た。
        english: I studied a lot for the exam and felt sick.
        hint: 「たくさん」 means 'a lot' or 'many', but 「あんなに」 implies 'to such an excessive degree' or 'like
          that (overwhelmingly)'. We're emphasizing the surprising or regrettable extent of the action.
    scene: A student complaining to a friend after an exam.
    register: casual

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時、彼 は なぜ とても 怒っ た の だろう？
        english: Why was he very angry at that time?
        hint: 「とても」 simply states a high degree of anger. 「あんなに」 questions the *unexpected or surprising
          extent* of that anger. We're looking for an expression that questions the specific, high degree
          of anger observed.
    scene: Someone is trying to understand a past argument.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of 「あんなに」 here reflects the speaker's surprise or bewilderment at the degree of his
      anger. It's an expression of "why *so* angry, like that?" rather than just "why angry?". The 「だろう」
      adds a sense of pondering.
  - english: I never expected it to be that bad.
    japanese:
      - あんな に 酷い と は 思わ なかっ た。

        english: I didn't think it would be that bad (referring to something the listener has some knowledge
          of).
        hint: 「そんなに」 is closer to the listener's perspective. 「あんなに」 suggests a general, often overwhelming,
          negative degree not directly tied to the listener's immediate understanding. We're looking for
          a general strong negative degree.
    scene: Someone discussing a disappointing event or situation.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
  - english: He looked so tired that I was worried.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は あんな に 疲れ た 顔 を し て い た の で、心配 し た。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は とても 疲れ た 顔 を し て い た の で、心配 し た。
        english: He looked very tired, so I worried.
        hint: While 「とても」 means 'very', 「あんなに」 emphasizes the *degree* of tiredness, implying "to such
          an extent that it was noticeable" or "like that (unusually so)". We're highlighting a remarkable
          level of fatigue.
    scene: A colleague is talking about another colleague's appearance.
    register: semi-formal

      - 本当 に あんな に 遠い の？
    english_literally: Really that much far is it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 本当 に 遠い の です か？
        english: Is it really far?
        hint: Omitting 「あんなに」 removes the nuance of questioning the *extent* or *degree* of farness, suggesting
          surprise. We're looking to emphasize the "that much" aspect of the distance.
    scene: A tourist asking a local about a destination's distance.

    setting: interrogative
  - english: Thank you for giving me so much.

          - たくさん 頂い て、ありがとう ござい ます。

        hint: 「たくさん」 simply means 'a lot'. 「あんなに」 adds a nuance of "to such an extent" or "so generously",
          emphasizing the surprising or overwhelming quantity received. We're conveying appreciation for
          an unexpectedly large amount.
    scene: A guest thanking a host after a meal or gathering.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: apologetic
  - english: I've never seen that much snow before.

      - あんな に 雪 が 降っ た の は 初めて だ。
      - あんな に 雪 が 降っ た の は 初めて です。
    english_literally: That much snow fell it was first time.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな に 雪 が 降っ た の は 初めて だ。
        english: I've never seen that much snow before (referring to snow in the listener's area).
        hint: 「そんなに」 would imply the snow amount is relative to the listener's general experience or location.
          「あんなに」 refers to a general, remarkable amount of snow, distant from common experience. We're
          describing an unprecedented amount of snow.
    scene: A person experiencing heavy snow for the first time in a new place.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
  - english: I want to be that strong.
    japanese:

    competing_grammar:

          - とても 強く なり たい。
          - すごく 強く なり たい。
        english: I want to be very strong.
        hint: 「とても」 or 「すごく」 indicate general high strength. 「あんなに」 expresses a desire to reach a *specific,
          high level* of strength, often observed in someone else. We're looking for an aspiration to
          a specific degree of strength.
    scene: A child watching a superhero on TV.
    register: casual
    setting: inspirational
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「あんなに」 here indicates aspiration to reach a *degree* of strength like the distant,
      perhaps idolized, figure. It's not just "I want to be strong," but "I want to be strong *to that
      extent*." This highlights the ambitious nature of the desire.
post_example_writeup: As you can see, あんなに is very versatile and can be used to express emphasis and surprise
  across various contexts. It focuses on the degree or extent of something, highlighting its remarkable
  or unexpected nature.
