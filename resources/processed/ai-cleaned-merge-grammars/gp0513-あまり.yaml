    "etymology": "The word 「余り (amari)」 itself means \"remainder\" or \"surplus.\" The grammar point builds upon this by indicating that something has been done to excess, leading to a particular result. The nuance is that the 'remainder' of the thing after the action led to this outcome.",
    "writeup": "As a noun, 「あまり」 means \"excess\" and refers to an amount of something that is in surplus. This noun is often used after various words to indicate that something happened or exists to an excessive degree, resulting in something negative. While 「余り」 itself isn't inherently negative, this grammar point generally appears in negative situations.\n\nTo use 「あまり」, attach it to the end of these structures:\n\n*   A verb (dictionary form)\n*   An い-adjective (turned into a noun using 「さ」 or 「み」) + 「の」\n*   A な-adjective + 「な」\n*   A noun + 「の」\n\nA phrase following 「あまり」 then highlights the negative result. The tense of the overall sentence depends on the first clause; therefore, the verb before 「あまり」 can appear in different tenses.",
