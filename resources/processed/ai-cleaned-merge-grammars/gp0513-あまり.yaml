        "nuance": "Emphasizes that the degree of the preceding action or state was so extreme that it inevitably led to the stated result. While the word 'あまり' itself is neutral, this grammar point often implies an undesirable outcome or a situation where the excessiveness caused difficulty."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「余り (amari)」 itself means \"remainder\" or \"surplus.\" The grammar point builds upon this by indicating that something has been done to excess, leading to a particular result. The nuance is that the 'remainder' of the thing after the action led to this outcome.",
    "writeup": "As a noun, 「あまり」 means \"excess\" and refers to an amount of something that is in surplus. This noun is often used after various words to indicate that something happened or exists to an excessive degree, resulting in something negative. While 「余り」 itself isn't inherently negative, this grammar point generally appears in negative situations.To use 「あまり」, attach it to the end of these structures:A verb (dictionary form)An い-adjective (turned into a noun using 「さ」 or 「み」) + 「の」A な-adjective + 「な」A noun + 「の」A phrase following 「あまり」 then highlights the negative result. The tense of the overall sentence depends on the first clause; therefore, the verb before 「あまり」 can appear in different tenses.",

The result is usually negative or undesirable, though the degree of negativity can vary from mild inconvenience to a serious consequence. Keep in mind that 「あまり」 requires a specific structure before it – a verb in dictionary form, a い-adjective converted to a noun, a な-adjective + 「な」, or a noun + 「の」. This differentiates it from other expressions of degree.",
