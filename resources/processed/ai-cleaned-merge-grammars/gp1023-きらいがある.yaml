    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「嫌い (kirai)」, meaning \"dislike\" or \"aversion,\" with the verb 「ある (aru)」, meaning \"to exist\" or \"to be.\" The literal sense is \"there is a dislike,\" which evolves into the nuance of having a tendency towards something undesirable. The character 嫌 (いや) inherently carries a negative connotation, reinforcing its usage for undesirable traits.",
    "writeup": "「嫌いがある (kirai ga aru)」 expresses a tendency toward something undesirable. It combines the noun 「嫌い (kirai)」 (dislike), the particle 「が (ga)」, and the verb 「ある (aru)」 (to be). It suggests a habit or inclination that isn't necessarily extreme, but noticeable. Often used with adverbs like 「少し (sukoshi)」 (a little) or 「どうも (dōmo)」 (somehow) to soften the tone. It is generally not used to describe one's own tendencies, as it implies a critical perspective.",
