    "etymology": "「嫌い」 (kirai) means 'dislike' or 'aversion'. The grammar point uses the structure 'dislike exists,' implying a tendency toward something negative or undesirable.",
    "writeup": "「嫌いがある」(kirai ga aru) combines the noun 「嫌い」 'a dislike', the particle 「が」, and the verb 「ある」 'to be'. It indicates a negative tendency or habit, and can be translated as 'to have a tendency to (A)' or 'to be prone to (A)'. It follows the dictionary form of verbs, verbs negated with 「ない」, or nouns ending with 「の」.\n\nA literal translation could be 'having the displeasure of (A)', with the 'tendency' implied.\n\nBecause 「嫌いがある」 is strong, it's often softened with words like 「少し」 'a little bit' or 「どうも」 'try as one might'.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「嫌いがある」 describes things displeasurable from the speaker's perspective, so it's usually not used about oneself.",
