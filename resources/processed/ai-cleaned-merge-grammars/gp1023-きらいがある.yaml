    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「嫌い (kirai)」, meaning \"dislike\" or \"aversion,\" with the verb 「ある (aru)」, meaning \"to exist\" or \"to be.\" The literal sense is \"there is a dislike,\" which evolves into the nuance of having a tendency towards something undesirable. The character 嫌 (いや) inherently carries a negative connotation, reinforcing its usage for undesirable traits. Its transition to hiragana in modern writing (きらいがある) highlights its grammaticalized use rather than a literal \"dislike\" meaning.",
    "writeup": "「きらいがある (kirai ga aru)」 expresses a tendency toward something undesirable. It combines the noun 「嫌い (kirai)」 (dislike), the particle 「が (ga)」, and the verb 「ある (aru)」 (to be). It suggests a habit or inclination that isn't necessarily extreme, but noticeable. Often used with adverbs like 「少し (sukoshi)」 (a little) or 「どうも (dōmo)」 (somehow) to soften the tone. It is generally not used to describe one's own tendencies, as it implies a critical perspective. This expression is primarily used to describe undesirable traits or habits of others, or general negative tendencies in situations or phenomena. While its literal kanji form is 嫌い, it is almost exclusively written in hiragana as きらいがある in modern Japanese.",

The key distinction for 「きらいがある」 is its inherent negative connotation and its use in more formal or critical contexts when describing a problematic aspect of someone or something.",
