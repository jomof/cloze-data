jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to express conjecture, probability, or to seek polite confirmation, implying the
    speaker has information supporting their belief.
  function: Expresses conjecture or probability, and seeks agreement or confirmation.
  nuance: Implies the speaker has some information leading to their belief, but acknowledges uncertainty
    or seeks polite agreement from the listener. Less assertive than a plain statement, more assertive
    than a pure question.
  grammatical-role: Sentence-ending particle/auxiliary verb
etymology: でしょう is derived from the copula です (desu), which indicates a state of being or identity. The
  suffix しょう (shō) is added to です to express conjecture, intention, or invitation in a polite manner.
  Over time, ですしょう contracted into でしょう. Its historical origin as a combination of a declarative copula
  and a conjectural suffix explains its dual function of expressing both likelihood and a gentle query
  for confirmation.
writeup: |-
  でしょう is a polite expression used to express **uncertainty, conjecture, or to seek confirmation** from the listener. It's often translated as "probably," "right?" or "isn't it?" in English. It's a polite form, and it indicates the speaker has some reason to believe what they are saying is true, but is not entirely certain. Consider it a polite way of making an assertion while inviting agreement.

  Generally, でしょう follows the plain form of verbs and adjectives (present, past, negative). For な-adjectives and nouns, the plain form だ is omitted before でしょう in polite speech, and the stem or noun is used directly. For example, 静か (shizuka) becomes 静かでしょう (shizuka deshou), not 静かだでしょう (shizuka da deshou).

  Although でしょう is polite, its usage varies depending on context. It's a versatile expression, suitable for making polite predictions, offering soft suggestions, or gently verifying information without being overly direct. The more casual contraction of でしょう is でしょ (desho), which is often used with close friends or family. In very formal contexts, or older literature, 〜ますでしょう (masu deshou) may occasionally be seen, although this is rare in modern conversational Japanese.
false_friends:
  - term: だろう
    meaning: Right?, Probably, Isn't it?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: だろう is the plain form of でしょう. Use it with friends and family; it lacks the politeness and
      formality of でしょう.
    grammar_point: だろう (conjecture)
  - term: じゃないか
    meaning: Isn't it?, Is it not?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: じゃないか is a more direct way of seeking agreement or pointing out something obvious. It has
      a slightly challenging or assertive tone, implying the speaker expects agreement, or is expressing
      a realization.
    grammar_point: じゃないか (isn't it?)
  - term: ね
    meaning: Isn't it?, Right? (Sentence ending particle)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: ね is a sentence-ending particle that also seeks agreement, but it's much softer and less assertive
      than でしょう. It primarily seeks listener empathy or confirmation of shared knowledge.
    grammar_point: ね (seeking agreement)
  - term: のではないだろうか
    meaning: I think ... isn't it?, It might be that..., Don't you agree?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: This expression conveys a more hesitant or thoughtful opinion. It's less direct than でしょう
      and implies a deeper consideration or suggestion of a conclusion.
    grammar_point: のではないだろうか (indirect suggestion)
  - term: かもしれない
    meaning: Might, Maybe, Probably
    kind: synonym
    nuance: かもしれない expresses a possibility, implying a lower degree of certainty than でしょう. でしょう suggests
      a higher likelihood or a reasoned conjecture, while かもしれない is a more general 'it might be'.
    grammar_point: かもしれない (might)
  - term: です
    meaning: Is, Am, Are (polite copula)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While でしょう is derived from です, です makes a definitive statement of fact, whereas でしょう adds
      an element of conjecture or seeks confirmation. You use です when stating a fact you are certain about;
      でしょう is used when you are less certain or want to invite agreement.
    grammar_point: です (polite copula)
  - term: です か
    meaning: Is it?, Are you? (polite question marker)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: です か forms a direct question seeking new information or explicit confirmation. でしょう implies
      the speaker already has some information or assumption and is seeking agreement, rather than a factual
      inquiry that requires a definitive yes/no answer.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:です か (polite question marker)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions all share a similar function of expressing uncertainty
  or seeking confirmation, they differ significantly in register, nuance, and the degree of certainty
  they convey. Be mindful of the context and your relationship with the listener when choosing the appropriate
  expression. でしょう is generally safe in polite company, while だろう is better suited for casual conversations.
  The other expressions carry slightly different connotations that can subtly alter the meaning of your
  sentence, so careful consideration is key to effective communication.

  - english: It's a holiday today, isn't it?
    japanese:
      - 今日 は 休み {でしょう}？
      - 今日 は 休み {でしょう} か？
      - 今日 は 休み {でしょう} ね？
      - 今日、休み {でしょう} か。
      - 今日 は 休み {でしょう}。
      - 今日 は 休み {でしょう} ね。
      - 今日 は お 休み {でしょう}？
    english_literally: Today is holiday, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み {です か}。
        english: Is today a holiday?
        hint: The scene of a colleague checking the schedule for confirmation, rather than a direct inquiry,
          makes this grammar point more appropriate, as it gently probes for agreement with a mild assumption,
          unlike the more direct form. We're looking for a polite confirmation with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み {だろう} か。
        english: I wonder if today is a holiday.
        hint: This form also expresses conjecture but is more common in casual settings, whereas the target
          grammar point is polite. We're looking for a polite confirmation with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み {だろう}？
        english: It's a holiday today, right?
        hint: 「だろう」 is the casual form of でしょう. While it also seeks confirmation, the scene implies a
          polite professional context, making でしょう more appropriate. We're looking for a polite confirmation
          with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み {じゃ ない か}。
        english: It's a holiday today, isn't it!
        hint: 「じゃないか」 conveys a stronger, sometimes challenging tone, asserting the speaker's belief,
          which doesn't fit the neutral, informative tone needed for a colleague checking a schedule.
          We're looking for a polite confirmation with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み です {ね}。
        english: It's a holiday today, isn't it?
        hint: While 「ですね」 also seeks agreement, でしょう implies a slight uncertainty or a degree of conjecture,
          which fits better when you are checking an assumption with someone. We're looking for a polite
          confirmation with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み {か も しれ ませ ん}。
        english: Today might be a holiday.
        hint: 「かもしれません」 expresses a weaker possibility. The scene suggests the speaker has some basis
          for their assumption, making でしょう (probably) more fitting than a mere 'might be'. We're looking
          for a polite confirmation with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み {です}。
        english: Today is a holiday.
        hint: 「です」 states a fact definitively. The scene requires a nuance of seeking confirmation or
          expressing a likelihood, rather than a certain statement. We're looking for a polite confirmation
          with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み な の で は {ない でしょう か}。
        english: Isn't it that today is a holiday?
        hint: This is a more formal and indirect way to express conjecture or question a possibility,
          whereas でしょう is more direct for polite confirmation. We're looking for a polite confirmation
          with an assumed fact.
    scene: A busy colleague checking the schedule with another.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「でしょう？」 is used here to politely confirm an assumed fact, common in workplace conversations.
      The use of 「今日」 (today) and 「休み」 (holiday) are N5-level vocabulary. 「でしょう」 in this context allows
      the speaker to express an assumption while still being polite and allowing for correction if their
      assumption is wrong. This is particularly useful in a professional environment when you want to
      avoid sounding too assertive or making a mistake. The interrogative 「か」 or the particle 「ね」 can
      be added to soften the inquiry or seek specific agreement, but the core meaning of polite conjecture
      remains.
    etymology: The etymology of 「でしょう」 as a contraction of 「です」 and 「しょう」 highlights its polite conjectural
      nature. The inclusion of 「休み」 before 「でしょう」 indicates a noun followed by the conjectural ending,
      fitting the formation rules for nouns.
  - english: He'll probably arrive around three.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 三 時 ごろ に 着く {でしょう}。
      - 彼 は 三 時 ごろ に 着く {でしょう} ね。
      - 彼 は 三 時 ごろ に 着く {でしょう} か。
    english_literally: He around 3 o'clock arrive probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 三 時 ごろ に 着く {だろう}。
        english: He'll probably arrive around three (casual).
        hint: While both express conjecture, this uses the plain form 「だろう」 which is less polite and suitable
          for casual conversation, unlike the formal setting implied. We're looking for a polite conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 三 時 ごろ に 着く {か も しれ ませ ん}。
        english: He might arrive around three.
        hint: 「かもしれません」 indicates a possibility with less certainty than でしょう, which implies a higher
          likelihood based on some information. We're looking for a polite conjecture with higher certainty.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 三 時 ごろ に 着く {はず です}。
        english: He should arrive around three (expected).
        hint: 「はずです」 suggests a stronger expectation or certainty, often based on a plan or established
          fact, whereas でしょう indicates a more general probability or assumption. We're looking for a polite
          conjecture.
    scene: Two colleagues discussing a client's arrival time.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「着く でしょう」 uses the plain form of the verb 「着く」 (tsuku) followed by でしょう, demonstrating how
      verbs attach to this structure. The phrase 「三 時 ごろ」 (sanji goro) indicates 'around three o'clock',
      a common adverbial phrase. The use of 「でしょう」 here makes the prediction polite and less assertive,
      suitable for a professional setting where one might not have definitive information but still wants
      to convey an informed expectation.
  - english: This cake must be delicious, don't you think?
    japanese:
      - この ケーキ は おいしい {でしょう}？
      - この ケーキ は おいしい {でしょう} ね。
      - この ケーキ は おいしい {でしょう} か。
    english_literally: This cake is delicious, probably?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ケーキ は おいしい {だろう}？
        english: This cake is probably delicious (casual).
        hint: The use of 「だろう」 would make this a casual inquiry, which doesn't fit the semi-formal setting
          of a tea party among acquaintances. We're looking for a polite confirmation/conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ケーキ は おいし {そう} です ね。
        english: This cake looks delicious, doesn't it?
        hint: 「そう」 describes an appearance, whereas でしょう expresses a conjecture about an inherent quality
          or current state. The speaker is conjecturing about the actual taste, not just the appearance.
          We're looking for a polite conjecture about taste.
    scene: At a tea party, one guest compliments a homemade cake.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「おいしい でしょう？」 connects the plain form of an い-adjective, 「おいしい」 (oishii), with でしょう. The question
      mark indicates a soft query for agreement, typical in polite social situations when expressing an
      opinion or observation. This usage is common when a speaker feels confident in their observation
      but wants to invite the listener to concur, fostering a friendly atmosphere.
  - english: The new cafe will probably be quiet.
    japanese:
      - 新しい カフェ は 静か {でしょう}。
      - 新しい カフェ は 静か {でしょう} ね。
      - 新しい カフェ は 静か {でしょう} か。
    english_literally: New cafe is quiet, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい カフェ は 静か {だろう}。
        english: The new cafe will probably be quiet (casual).
        hint: This uses the casual form 「だろう」, which would be inappropriate for a conversation with a
          senior. We're looking for a polite conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい カフェ は 静か {です か も しれ ませ ん}。
        english: The new cafe might be quiet.
        hint: While also conjecture, 「かもしれません」 implies less certainty, whereas でしょう is used for a more
          probable prediction based on current information. We're looking for a polite conjecture with
          higher certainty.
    scene: A junior employee discusses local spots with their senior at work.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: Here, 「静かでしょう」 shows the usage with a な-adjective stem 「静か」 (shizuka). Unlike い-adjectives,
      the な-adjective simply drops the だ and connects directly to でしょう. This polite conjecture about the
      cafe's atmosphere is typical in conversations where one offers an informed opinion to a superior,
      maintaining politeness while sharing insight.
  - english: That person must be the new manager, right?
    japanese:
      - あの 人 が 新しい 部長 {でしょう}？

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 人 が 新しい 部長 {です か}？
        english: Is that person the new manager?
        hint: 「です か」 is a direct question, seeking factual information, while 「でしょう」 implies a speaker's
          assumption seeking confirmation. The scene suggests an observation that needs gentle confirmation,
          not a blank inquiry. We're looking for a polite confirmation of an assumption.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 人 が 新しい 部長 {だろう}？
        english: That person is probably the new manager, right? (casual)
        hint: This uses the casual form 「だろう」 which is unsuitable for a formal office setting. We're looking
          for a polite confirmation of an assumption.
    scene: Two employees observe a new face in the office.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「部長でしょう？」 illustrates the use of でしょう with a noun, 「部長」 (buchou, manager). Similar to な-adjectives,
      nouns directly precede でしょう in polite conjecture. This sentence is a polite way to confirm an identity
      based on observation, allowing the listener to easily affirm or correct without awkwardness.

    japanese:
      - 昨日 は 寒かっ た {でしょう}。

    english_literally: Yesterday was cold, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 は 寒かっ た {と 思い ます}。
        english: I think it was cold yesterday.
        hint: 「と 思います」 expresses a personal opinion, whereas 「でしょう」 here is a conjecture based on observable
          facts (like frost), inviting agreement rather than just stating a thought. We're looking for
          a polite conjecture based on evidence.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 は 寒かっ た {そう} です ね。
        english: I heard it was cold yesterday, right?
        hint: 「そう です」 indicates hearsay, meaning the speaker heard it from someone else, but the scene
          implies the speaker observed evidence themselves. We're looking for a polite conjecture based
          on evidence.
    scene: A neighbor remarks on the morning frost to another.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「寒かったでしょう」 demonstrates でしょう used with the past tense of an い-adjective, 「寒かった」 (samukatta).
      This allows for polite conjecture about past states. The nuance here is a gentle observation and
      invitation for agreement, often used among acquaintances or neighbors, making conversation flow
      smoothly.
  - english: She's probably serious about her studies.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 勉強 に 真剣 {でしょう}。

    english_literally: She towards studies serious, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 勉強 に 真剣 {そう} です。
        english: She looks serious about her studies.
        hint: 「そう です」 describes appearance, while 「でしょう」 here conjectures about an internal state (seriousness)
          based on observations, suggesting a higher degree of inference. We're looking for a polite conjecture
          about an internal state.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 勉強 に 真剣 だ {と 思い ます}。
        english: I think she is serious about her studies.
        hint: 「と 思います」 is a direct personal opinion. 「でしょう」 offers that opinion as a conjecture, seeking
          gentle affirmation or allowing for difference of opinion without being confrontational. We're
          looking for a polite conjecture.
    scene: A teacher comments on a diligent student's attitude to a colleague.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「真剣でしょう」 combines a な-adjective stem 「真剣」 (shinken) with でしょう to form a polite conjecture
      about someone's internal characteristic. In an academic setting, this allows for a professional
      yet gentle way of discussing students, implying an informed observation without stating it as an
      absolute fact. The politeness of でしょう respects the colleague's own observations.
  - english: That's probably what he meant.
    japanese:
      - それ が 彼 の 言い たかっ た こと {でしょう}。
      - それ が 彼 の 言い たかっ た こと {でしょう} ね。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ が 彼 の 言い たかっ た こと だ {と 思い ます}。
        english: I think that's what he meant.
        hint: While similar, 「と 思います」 is a more direct statement of personal thought. 「でしょう」 softens it
          into a conjecture, which is more suitable for a group discussion where different interpretations
          are possible. We're looking for a polite conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ が 彼 の 言い たかっ た こと {か な}。
        english: I wonder if that's what he meant.
        hint: 「かな」 expresses more personal doubt and is casual, whereas 「でしょう」 maintains politeness and
          invites general agreement from the group. We're looking for a polite conjecture suitable for
          a group discussion.
    scene: During a group discussion, clarifying a previous speaker's unclear statement.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「ことでしょう」 uses でしょう after a nominalized phrase, 「言いたかった こと」 (iitakatta koto, what he wanted
      to say). This structure allows for polite conjecture about abstract concepts or past intentions.
      In a group setting, using でしょう maintains a cooperative atmosphere, inviting others to consider the
      interpretation without imposing it as fact. The phrase 「それ が」 (sore ga) highlights the specific
      interpretation being offered.
  - english: You must be tired, aren't you?
    japanese:

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 疲れ {です か}？
        english: Are you tired?
        hint: A direct question 「です か」 can sound abrupt or accusatory. 「でしょう」 expresses empathy by first
          assuming tiredness, then gently seeking confirmation, making it more thoughtful. We're looking
          for an empathetic conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 疲れ だ {と 思い ます}。
        english: I think you are tired.
        hint: Stating 「と 思います」 as a personal thought is less engaging than でしょう, which subtly invites
          the listener to agree or offer more information about their state. We're looking for an empathetic
          conjecture.
    scene: Greeting a family member returning home after a long day.

    setting: supportive
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「お 疲れ でしょう？」 is a very common and empathetic use of でしょう, often functioning as a greeting.
      「お 疲れ」 (otsukare) is a polite expression for 'tiredness' or 'hard work'. When combined with でしょう,
      it forms a soft, considerate inquiry, showing concern while assuming the listener's state, making
      it a very warm and polite expression typically used among family or colleagues. The absence of an
      explicit subject like 「あなた」 (anata) is natural in Japanese when the subject is clear from context.

          - この プロジェクト は きっと 成功 する {はず です}。
        english: This project is supposed to succeed (strong expectation).
        hint: 「はず です」 implies an expectation based on a known plan or reason, whereas でしょう can convey
          a more hopeful or confident prediction without necessarily relying on explicit justification.
          We're looking for a polite, confident conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この プロジェクト は きっと 成功 する {と 思い ます}。
        english: I think this project will certainly succeed.
        hint: 「と 思います」 is a statement of personal belief. 「でしょう」, especially with 「きっと」, projects that
          belief as a strong likelihood, gently inviting shared optimism rather than simply stating an
          opinion. We're looking for a polite, confident conjecture.

    nuance: 「成功 する でしょう」 combines the plain form of the verb 「成功 する」 (seikou suru, to succeed) with でしょう.
      The adverb 「きっと」 (kitto, surely/certainly) strengthens the conjecture, implying a high degree of
      confidence. This usage is common when expressing hopeful predictions or offering encouragement,
      balancing a strong assertion with polite deference to the listener's perspective, which is important
      in leadership.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 の 天気 は 晴れる {だろう} か。
        english: I wonder if tomorrow's weather will be sunny (casual).
        hint: While similar in meaning, this uses the plain form 「だろう か」 which is more suitable for casual
          self-reflection or a very informal query, not for a polite conversation with an acquaintance.
          We're looking for a polite confirmation/conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 の 天気 は 晴れる と 予想 {さ れ ます}。
        english: Tomorrow's weather is predicted to be sunny.
        hint: This is a statement of official prediction, using the passive voice. 「でしょう」 is a more personal,
          polite conjecture often used in casual conversation among friends or neighbors, not a formal
          report. We're looking for a polite conjecture.

    nuance: 「晴れ でしょう？」 combines the noun 「晴れ」 (hare, sunny weather) with でしょう. This is a common way to
      make a polite conjecture about future events, especially weather. The nuance is a light, conversational
      query, inviting the other person to share their knowledge or agreement, fitting for a relaxed exchange
      between neighbors. The use of 「明日 の 天気」 (ashita no tenki) clearly sets the topic as 'tomorrow's
      weather'.
post_example_writeup: The variations in formation allow for different degrees of certainty and politeness.
  While でしょう always carries a polite tone, the context and the speaker's intention determine whether it's
  a polite conjecture or a gentle request for confirmation. Paying attention to the preceding word's form
  (plain verb/い-adjective, or stem for な-adjective/noun) is crucial for correct usage.
