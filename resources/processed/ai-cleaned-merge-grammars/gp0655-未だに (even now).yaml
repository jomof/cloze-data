details:
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: General
  function: Emphasizes the continuation of a state or action for an unexpectedly long time, often implying
    surprise, frustration, or disbelief.
  nuance: Carries a stronger implication of duration and often a more formal tone compared to まだ. It suggests
    that the current state has continued for much longer than anticipated or desired, emphasizing unexpected
    persistence.
  logical-flow: Used to express that a situation or state that was expected to have changed or ended by
    now continues to persist. It highlights a surprising or unexpected continuation.
  temporal-flow: Refers to a state or action that began in the past and continues into the present, often
    for a duration considered longer than usual or expected. It signifies an ongoing situation 'even now'.
etymology: 「未だに」 originates from 「未だ」 (mada), meaning "still" or "not yet," combined with the particle
  「に」 (ni). While 「未だ」 itself can mean "still" or "not yet," adding 「に」 emphasizes the adverbial nature
  and often the surprising or persistent nature of the continued state.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「未だに」 is an adverbial expression conveying the meaning of "still," "not yet," or "even now." It denotes a situation or state that has persisted for a surprisingly long time, often implying a sense of disbelief, frustration, or disappointment that things have not changed or progressed as expected.

  While sharing a similar core meaning with 「まだ」, 「未だに」 carries a stronger nuance of duration and often a more formal tone. Its usage suggests that the current state has continued for a much longer period than anticipated or desired, emphasizing the unexpected persistence. Think of it as conveying a sense of "*still*, after all this time," or "*even now*, it hasn't changed."

  Though both まだ and 未だ share the same kanji 未, 「未だに」 specifically uses this kanji in its written form, reinforcing its slightly more formal or emphatic register compared to the more common hiragana 「まだ」. It functions adverbially and typically appears at the beginning of a clause or sentence, modifying the verb or predicate.

  - term: まだ
    meaning: still, not yet
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「未だに」, 「まだ」 is less formal and simply indicates that a state or action is ongoing or
      has not yet occurred, without necessarily implying a sense of surprise, frustration, or a particularly
      long duration. 「まだ」 is a neutral description, whereas 「未だに」 often carries an emotional or critical
      tone about the persistence of a situation.
    grammar_point: まだ (still・not yet)
  - term: 依然として
    meaning: Still; as ever; as before; unchanged
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「依然として」 is more objective and formal than 「未だに」. It describes a situation or state that remains
      unchanged, often in official reports or scientific contexts, without carrying the emotional weight
      of surprise, frustration, or disappointment often found with 「未だに」. While both mean 'still', 「依然として」
      focuses on the factual lack of change, whereas 「未だに」 highlights the unexpected persistence.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:依然として (still・as ever)
  - term: 相変わらず
    meaning: As ever; as usual; as before
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「相変わらず」 typically implies that something is continuing in its usual or expected way, often
      with a neutral or even affectionate tone. It's used in more casual or personal contexts to comment
      on a lack of change. Unlike 「未だに」, it doesn't suggest frustration or unexpectedness, but rather
      a predictable continuity.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:相変わらず (as ever・as usual)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「未だに」 and 「まだ」, consider the nuance you wish to convey.
  If the continuation of a state or action is unexpected, surprising, or has gone on for a notably long
  time, 「未だに」 is more appropriate. It implies a sense of lingering, often with an underlying feeling of
  disappointment or disbelief. If you simply mean 'still' or 'not yet' without such a strong emotional
  or temporal emphasis, 「まだ」 is the more common and natural choice. 「未だに」 explicitly highlights the unexpected
  persistence 'even now', whereas 「まだ」 is a simpler 'still' or 'not yet'. The terms 「依然として」 and 「相変わらず」
  also denote continuation but vary in their formality and implied emotional tone. 「依然として」 maintains an
  objective, formal stance on unchanging conditions, while 「相変わらず」 conveys a neutral or familiar sense
  of continuity.

          the strong implication of unexpected persistence).
        hint: The scene implies a widespread trend, making the continued use of flip phones a surprising
          observation. 「未だに」 emphasizes this unexpected persistence more strongly than 「まだ」. We're looking

    scene: A general observation about technological trends.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「普及している中」 implies a prevailing trend, making the continued use of flip phones,
      expressed with 「{未だ に}」、 a surprising observation for an older speaker who might expect everyone
      to have adapted to newer technology. This usage highlights a sense of a lingering, old-fashioned
      element amidst modern prevalence, which an older person might observe with a mild sense of bewilderment
      or nostalgia.

    nuance: This sentence reflects a personal, lasting memory. The casual register is appropriate for
      a personal reflection. The use of 「覚えている」 emphasizes the enduring nature of the memory, which is
      reinforced by 「{未だ に}」. While no specific gendered language is present, the phrase 「覚えている」 often
      carries an emotional weight, which is a common expression for a female speaker recalling a significant
      past event. The long duration implied by 「{未だ に}」 underscores the lingering emotional impact of
      the accident on the speaker, suggesting it continues to affect her 'even now'.

        hint: This sentence expresses frustration about an expected change that hasn't occurred despite
          a significant amount of time and intervention. 「未だに」 emphasizes this unexpected lack of change
          and the speaker's frustration more effectively than 「まだ」. We're looking for an expression that
          conveys surprise or disappointment at a persistent lack of change.
    scene: An employee discussing a manager's unchanged behavior with a colleague.
    register: semi-formal

    nuance: The speaker expresses frustration about the manager's lack of improvement. The term 「変わらない」
      implies an expectation of change. The use of 「{未だ に}」 highlights the speaker's disappointment that

      complaints about workplace issues, emphasizing the unchanging nature of the manager's attitude 'even
      now'.

          a sense of gravity and emphasizes the surprising persistence of the unresolved situation more
          than 「まだ」. We're looking for an expression that highlights the surprising continuation of an
          unresolved serious situation.
    scene: A news report providing an update on a long-term missing person case.

      use this soft expression to indicate her enduring feelings, hinting at deeper emotions while maintaining

          emphasizing the enduring, surprising nature of the feeling).
        hint: This expresses a deep, enduring emotional connection that has persisted for an unexpectedly
          long time. 「未だに」 emphasizes the surprising and unwavering nature of these feelings, making the
          confession more impactful than 「まだ」. We're looking for an expression that highlights the surprising
          persistence of strong feelings.
    scene: A person confessing their enduring feelings to someone they like.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female

      and slightly masculine, declarative tone, characteristic of flirting. 「{未だ に} 忘れられない」 expresses

          conveying frustration at the lack of progress).
        hint: This expresses frustration or disbelief at a long-standing inadequacy that has surprisingly

      resistance to change. The phrase 「5GB の ままだ」 emphasizes that the capacity remains the same 'even
      now', implying a failure to innovate or upgrade, which is a common point of contention in technology
      discussions among users, hence the semi-formal register of a forum post.

        english: Even though they had been living together for 5 years, Jake wasn't able to completely
          grasp Finn's character (without emphasizing the profound and surprising lack of understanding).
        hint: This describes a profound and surprising lack of understanding despite a long period of
          close contact. 「未だに」 underscores this significant and unexpected duration of the unresolved
          state more effectively than 「まだ」. We're looking for an expression that highlights the surprising
          persistence of a fundamental lack of understanding.
    scene: A narrative observation in a novel about character dynamics.
    register: bungo (literary)
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: This sentence employs a more literary register suitable for narrative. 「{未だ に}」 underscores
      the profound lack of understanding despite a long period of close cohabitation. It suggests a subtle,
      perhaps tragic, aspect of the relationship, implying a surprising emotional distance. The phrase
      「完全に把握できていなかった」 combined with 「{未だ に}」 emphasizes that this fundamental understanding has not been
      achieved 'even now', despite ample opportunity, adding depth to the character analysis in a literary
      context. The use of 「bungo」 here signifies a more formal and classical narrative style, often found
      in novels and historical accounts, which is consistent with the heightened emphasis of 「未だに」 over
      「まだ」.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「未だに」 emphasizes a continuation that is often unexpected,
  surprising, or frustrating, setting it apart from the simpler 'still' conveyed by 「まだ」. It is typically
  used when the speaker feels that a situation should have changed or resolved by now, but it hasn't.
