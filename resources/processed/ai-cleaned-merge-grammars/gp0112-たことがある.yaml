    "etymology": "「た」 is the past tense form of a verb. 「こと」 nominalizes the verb phrase, turning it into a noun-like phrase. 「が」 is a particle indicating the subject. 「ある」 means \"to exist\" or \"to have.\" Therefore, literally, 「たことがある」 means \"there is a thing that happened.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **たことがある** is a fundamental Japanese expression used to convey the **experience of having done something**. It literally translates to \"there is a time when I did (something)\" or \"there is the experience of having done (something).\"\n\nTo form this expression, a verb is conjugated into its past tense (た-form), which is then followed by **こと**, the particle **が**, and finally **ある**.\n\n**Formation:**\n*   **Verb (た-form) + ことがある**: To express having an experience.\n*   **Verb (た-form) + ことがない**: To express never having had an experience.\n\nWhile **こと** and **の** can both function as nominalizers (turning a verb phrase into a noun-like phrase), **こと** is specifically required in this **たことがある** construction. **の** cannot be substituted here. This distinction is important because **こと** often refers to specific, tangible experiences or facts, whereas **の** can sometimes refer to a more general action or situation. For example, when **こと** is followed by a verb phrase (like in this structure), **の** typically cannot be used.\n\nThe negative form, **たことがない**, is used to state that one has **never** had a particular experience. Just as **ある** indicates the existence of an experience, **ない** (the negative form of **ある**) indicates the non-existence of such an experience.\n\nThis grammar point emphasizes the **existence or non-existence of a past event as an experience**, rather than merely stating a past fact. For instance, 「日本に行った」 (I went to Japan) simply states a past action, while 「日本に行ったことがある」 (I have been to Japan / I have had the experience of going to Japan) specifically highlights the personal experience gained from that action.",
