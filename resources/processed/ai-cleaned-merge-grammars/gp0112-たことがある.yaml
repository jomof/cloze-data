    "etymology": "「た」 is the past tense auxiliary verb. 「こと」 is a nominalizer, turning the preceding verb into a noun-like phrase. 「が」 is a particle indicating the subject. 「ある」 means \"to exist\" or \"to have.\"",
    "writeup": "「たことがある」 is a set expression in Japanese used to express that you have had the experience of doing something. The auxiliary verb 「た」 is added to the verb indicating what you have done, followed by 「ことがある」. 「こと」 nominalizes the verb, turning it into a noun-like phrase, but it **cannot** be replaced with 「の」 in this grammar point.\n\nThe negative form, 「たことがない」, uses 「ない」 (the negative form of 「ある」) to express that you have 'never' done something.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This grammar point emphasizes the *experience* of doing something, not necessarily the completed action.",
