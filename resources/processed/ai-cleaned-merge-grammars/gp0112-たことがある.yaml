    "etymology": "「た」 is the past tense form of a verb. 「こと」 nominalizes the verb phrase, turning it into a noun-like phrase. 「が」 is a particle indicating the subject. 「ある」 means \"to exist\" or \"to have.\" Therefore, literally, 「たことがある」 means \"there is a thing that happened.\"",
    "writeup": "「たことがある」 is used to express that you **have experience doing something**. It literally means \"there is a time when I have done (something).\" The verb indicating the action is put into the past tense 「た」 form, followed by 「ことがある」. Its negative form 「たことがない」 means you have **never** done something. This grammatical pattern is crucial for discussing past experiences in Japanese.",
