    "etymology": "The grammar point 「つもりで」 comes from 「つもり」 (intention, plan) combined with the particle 「で」 (by means of, with). Thus, literally, it means \"with the intention of\".",
    "writeup": "「つもりで」 combines the noun 「つもり」 (intention) with the particle 「で」 (with). This structure has several uses, depending on the preceding word.\n\nWhen used with verbs, な-adjectives, or nouns in their plain forms, 「つもりで」 indicates that action B is done with the intention of A. When つもり connects to another noun or a な-adjective, use の between them.\n\nWhen paired with verbs in the past form, 「つもりで」 implies the speaker is acting as though A, pretending that A, or is convinced that A. This meaning comes from the intention being contrary to the actual truth.",
