    "etymology": "The grammar point 「つもりで」 comes from the noun 「つもり」 (intention, plan) combined with the particle 「で」 (by means of, with). Thus, literally, it means \"with the intention of\". This combination highlights the premise or mindset under which an action is performed.",
    "writeup": "「つもりで」 combines the noun 「つもり」 (intention, plan, belief) with the particle 「で」 (by means of, with). This structure has several uses, depending on the preceding word and the tense. When used with verbs in their plain non-past form, 「つもりで」 indicates that action B is done with the intention of A. For instance, 「駅まで歩いて行くつもりで家を出た」 means \"I left the house with the intention of walking to the station.\" This expresses a planned action or a guiding purpose.\n\nWhen paired with verbs in the plain past form, or with nouns and adjectives (in their plain forms, often with a connecting particle like 「の」 or 「な」 for nouns and な-adjectives), 「つもりで」 implies that the speaker or subject is acting as though A, pretending that A, or is convinced that A, even if A is not factually true. For example, 「彼女はもう大人だつもりで、親の言うことを聞かない」 (She acts as if she's already an adult, and doesn't listen to her parents). Here, the 'adult' status is a self-perception or pretense guiding her actions, not necessarily a factual age.\n\nIt is important to note that while 「つもり」 itself can also express pure intention or conviction (as in 「するつもりだ」 meaning \"I intend to do\"), the addition of 「で」 specifically frames this intention or belief as the *basis* or *premise* for another action or state.",
