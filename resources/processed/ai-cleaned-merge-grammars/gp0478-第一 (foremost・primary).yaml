jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: General
etymology: The term 「第一」 is composed of 「第」, indicating order or position, and 「一」, meaning one. Together,
  they signify the foremost or the first in order, highlighting its primary or most important nature.
writeup: 第一 (daiichi) functions as both an adverb and a noun. As an adverb, typically followed by **に**,
  it conveys "first," "to begin with," or "above all else." As a noun, it means "foremost" or "most important."
  In this capacity, it is commonly followed by **の** when modifying another noun, or by the auxiliary
  verb **だ** at the end of a sentence. The combination **まず第一に (mazu daiichi ni)** is used to emphasize
  "the very first" or "first and foremost," adding a stronger sense of priority or initial action. The
  kanji **第 (dai)** denotes "order" or "position," while **一 (ichi)** means "one." Thus, **第一** literally
  signifies "first position." This indicates its primary or leading role, whether in sequence, importance,
  or as a starting point.

  - term: 一番
    meaning: most, best, number one
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 一番 (ichiban) also means 'number one' or 'best,' 第一 (daiichi) emphasizes a more fundamental,
      primary, or foundational importance, often in a structured or formal context. 一番 is more general
      and can apply to anything from 'best ice cream' to 'most important thing.'
    grammar_point: 一番 (superlative)
  - term: 最初
    meaning: first, beginning, initial
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 最初 (saisho) refers to the temporal beginning of something, the first point in a sequence of
      events. 第一 can also indicate 'first' but often implies 'first in importance,' 'foremost,' or 'number
      one' in a structured list, not just the earliest in time.
    grammar_point: '<suggest>: 最初 (first・beginning)'
  - term: 優先
    meaning: priority, precedence
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 優先 (yūsen) explicitly means to prioritize something. 第一 (daiichi) implies making something
      the foremost or absolute primary consideration, often with a stronger sense of fundamental importance
      or principle than 優先.
    grammar_point: '<suggest>: 優先 (priority・precedence)'
  - term: まず
    meaning: first, to begin with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: まず (mazu) primarily denotes a temporal 'first step' or an initial action. While it can introduce
      a list of points, it lacks the strong emphasis on 'foremost' or 'paramount importance' that 第一 (daiichi)
      conveys, especially when used alone.
    grammar_point: まず (priority・initial action)
  - term: 何より
    meaning: more than anything, above all else
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「何より」(nani yori) often expresses a subjective feeling of what is most important or desirable,
      like 'more than anything else I value...'. 「第一」(daiichi) is more objective, indicating the top priority
      or foundational element in a structured context, often implying a logical or established ranking.
    grammar_point: 何より (more than anything)
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 一番 (ichiban), 最初 (saisho), 優先 (yūsen), まず (mazu), and
  何より (nani yori) can sometimes be used similarly, 第一 (daiichi) carries a distinct nuance. 一番 broadly
  means 'most' or 'best,' while 最初 focuses on the temporal 'beginning.' 優先 specifically indicates 'prioritizing'
  something, and まず denotes a 'first step.' 何より emphasizes subjective importance, meaning 'more than anything
  else.' In contrast, 第一 emphasizes something being the foremost or absolute primary consideration, often
  serving as a fundamental principle or the leading item in a formal classification or ranking. It's less
  about a general 'best' or 'first in time' and more about 'first in significance' or 'primary importance,'
  often in a structured or objective manner.

  importance, whether it''s the most critical step, the primary goal, or a foundational principle. Its
  usage can range from formal settings like legal documents and academic discussions to more casual expressions
  of personal values, always emphasizing its role as the ''foremost'' or ''number one'' element in its
  respective context. Pay attention to the particles used with it: 「第一に」 when it functions adverbially,
  and 「第一の + Noun」 or 「第一だ/です」 when it functions as a noun emphasizing priority.'
