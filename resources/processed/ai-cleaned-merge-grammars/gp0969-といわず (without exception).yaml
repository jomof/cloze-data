jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Primarily used in written language or highly formal spoken contexts, conveying a sense
    of thoroughness or universality.
etymology: The grammar point 「といわず」 is derived from 「と」 (a particle indicating quotation), 「言わず」 (the
  negative form of the verb 「言う」 meaning "to say"), and 「ず」 (a classical negative auxiliary verb, equivalent
  to 「ない」). The literal sense is "without saying (A), and without saying (B)", indicating that the statement
  applies beyond A and B. Something is applied regardless of whether it is A or B, implying it applies
  to the entire scope.
writeup: 「といわず」 indicates that something is not limited to either A or B, but applies to everything within
  a specific category or group. It translates to "not only A or B, but all," or "A, B, and everything
  else." It's a combination of the particle 「と」 (in its "quotation" use), the negative stem of 「言う」 (言わ),
  and the literary form of the classical auxiliary verb 「ず」. The literal meaning is 'without saying A,
  and without saying B, (C)', where 'without saying A' implies 'without limiting it to A'. The structure
  follows noun A and noun B before explaining what applies to everything. Both A and B should belong to
  a logical group for the expression to sound natural, such as "hands and feet" being parts of the body,
  or "morning and afternoon" being parts of a day. This grammar point is a formal expression, less common
  in everyday speech and more typically encountered in **written language** or very **formal spoken contexts**.

  - term: も～も
    meaning: Both A and B; also A and also B
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「も～も」 connects items, indicating they *all* share a certain characteristic or action. It functions
      as an exhaustive listing. In contrast, 「といわず」 uses two representative examples to imply an *entire
      range* or *category*, emphasizing comprehensive application or disregard for specific conditions.
    grammar_point: も~も (both neither ~ nor)
  - term: ～ても
    meaning: Even if; even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～ても」 expresses a concessive condition, meaning 'even if A, then B.' Its focus is on the conditional
      outcome. 「といわず」 emphasizes that an action or state is not confined by or concerned with the stated
      examples, applying universally or comprehensively to an entire domain.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: ～に限らず
    meaning: not limited to; not only
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～に限らず」 indicates that something applies to more than just the mentioned item, expanding the
      scope. While similar in meaning, 「といわず」 specifically uses two representative examples to assert
      that an action or state applies to the entire range or domain without exception, often implying
      disregard for the specific examples.
    grammar_point: に限らず (not limited to)
  - term: ～だけでなく
    meaning: not only... but also
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～だけでなく」 adds items to a list, indicating that the action or state applies to the first item
      *and* subsequent items. It focuses on additive inclusion. 「といわず」, however, uses two examples to
      suggest a pervasive, all-encompassing application, implying that the action or state applies to
      *everything* within a category, not just the specified items.
    grammar_point: 〜だけでなく・〜ばかりでなく・〜ばかりか (not only... but also)
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 「も～も」, 「～ても」, 「～に限らず」, and 「～だけでなく」 share some functional
  overlap with 「といわず」, each carries a distinct nuance. 「も～も」 simply lists exhaustively. 「～ても」 expresses
  a concessive condition. 「～に限らず」 expands the scope beyond a single example. 「～だけでなく」 adds further examples.
  In contrast, 「といわず」 uniquely emphasizes a comprehensive, pervasive, or all-encompassing application
  of an action or state, often by citing two representative or contrasting examples to imply an entire
  range or category, suggesting a disregard for specific conditions or limits.
