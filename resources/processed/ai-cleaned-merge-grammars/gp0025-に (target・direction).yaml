  details:
    part-of-speech: particle
    particle-syntactic-function: case-marking
    usage-context: general
    function: Indicates a precise location, target, time, recipient, or purpose, marking the endpoint or
      destination of an action or state.
    nuance: Marks the endpoint or destination of an action or state, emphasizing the target point or recipient.
      It signifies 'arrival at' or 'fixation on' a specific point.
    counterpoint: Often contrasted with で (de), which marks the location where an action takes place, not
      the endpoint of the action itself.
    colocation: Frequently used with verbs of existence (いる, ある), movement (行く, 来る, 帰る), and verbs indicating
      giving/receiving (あげる, もらう, 教える).
    grammatical-role: Marks the indirect object, target, or specific time/location.
    logical-flow: Establishes a clear relationship between an action or state and its specific target or
      destination.
    temporal-flow: Pinpoints a specific moment or interval for an action or event.
    spatial-flow: Indicates a precise location or direction of movement or existence in space, marking the
      destination or fixed point.
  etymology: The particle に has ancient roots in Old Japanese, functioning primarily as a locative and directional
    marker. It is believed to have evolved from a case ending indicating a fixed point, target, or destination.
    Over centuries, its usage expanded to encompass time, recipients, and purposes, all retaining the core
    idea of 'towards' or 'at' a specific point or outcome. Its fundamental role has remained remarkably
    consistent across the history of the language, making it one of the most foundational particles.
  writeup: 'に is a highly versatile particle in Japanese, often posing a challenge for learners due to its
    many possible English translations such as "in," "at," "to," "for," or "on." However, its core meaning
    remains consistent: に marks the **endpoint** or **destination** of an action or state. This implies
    that the action described can only be considered complete or capable of being completed once you reach
    or while you are at the specified location or time.For instance, verbs like 住む (sumu, "to live/dwell")
    often use に, not で. This is because living is an action that is ''completed'' at the destination; you
    can only complete the act of dwelling in the place where you live. This contrasts with で, which marks
    the location *where* an action takes place, implying an activity *within* a space rather than a destination
    or fixed point of being. Understanding this fundamental concept of an ''endpoint'' or ''target'' is
    crucial for mastering the various applications of に.While には generally used in standard speech, its
    flexibility allows it to appear across all registers, from highly formal to very casual. The choice
    of verb and context will determine the overall register of the sentence, rather than the particle に
    itself.'
  false_friends:
    - term: で (location of action)
      meaning: at, in
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: Unlike に, で specifies the location where an action *happens*, not the destination or fixed
        point of existence. For example, 公園で遊ぶ (kōen de asobu) means "play in the park," indicating the
        action of playing occurs within the park. に emphasizes the outcome or endpoint, while で emphasizes
        the setting or means of an action. For example, 部屋にいる (heya ni iru, 'to be in the room') uses に
        because it's a fixed state of existence, whereas 部屋で勉強する (heya de benkyō suru, 'to study in the
        room') uses で because studying is an action performed within the room.
      grammar_point: で (location of action)
    - term: にて
      meaning: in, at, with, using, by
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike に, にて is a more formal expression often used in written language, formal announcements,
        or traditional contexts to indicate location, means, or method. For example, 会議室にて (kaigishitsu
        nite) means "in the conference room," but is more formal than 会議室に. It often implies a designated
        venue or method.
      grammar_point: にて (formal at・by means of)
    - term: へ (directional particle)
      meaning: To, toward
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: While both に and へ indicate direction, へ emphasizes the *direction* or *route* towards a destination,
        often without strong implication of arrival. に emphasizes the *destination* itself as the endpoint
        of movement or the fixed location. For example, 東京へ行く (Tokyo e iku) emphasizes the act of heading
        towards Tokyo, while 東京に行く (Tokyo ni iku) emphasizes the arrival in Tokyo. When the destination
        is a specific location or person, に is generally more precise.
      grammar_point: へ (directional particle)
    - term: から (from)
      meaning: From
      kind: antonym
      nuance: から marks the *starting point* or *source* of an action, state, or material, whereas に marks
        the *destination* or *endpoint*. For example, 日本から来た (Nihon kara kita, 'came from Japan') indicates
        origin, while 日本に行った (Nihon ni itta, 'went to Japan') indicates destination. They are often directional
        opposites.
      grammar_point: から (from)
    - term: を (object marker)
      meaning: Particle marking the direct object of a transitive verb.
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: While を marks the direct object of transitive verbs, に can mark the target or object for certain
        intransitive or semi-transitive verbs (e.g., 〜に座る - suwaru ni - 'to sit on', 〜に乗る - noru ni - 'to
        ride on'). The choice depends on the verb's transitivity and its specific complement requirements.
        に indicates the point of contact or attachment for these verbs, whereas を indicates the direct receiver
        of an action.
      grammar_point: を (object marker)
  post_false_friends_writeup: The key difference between に and で lies in their function. に indicates a fixed
    point, a destination, a recipient, or a specific time, essentially marking the *endpoint* or *target*
    of an action or state. Conversely, で specifies the place where an action *occures* or the means by which
    an action is performed. にて, on the other hand, is a more formal alternative to に, often used in official
    contexts or writing. Additionally, に contrasts with へ, where に specifies the definite arrival at a destination,
    while へ indicates movement *towards* a general direction. から marks the starting point or origin, serving
    as a directional opposite to に's destination. Lastly, while を marks the direct object of a transitive
    verb, に is used for the target or indirect object of specific verbs, including those that express movement
    to a fixed point or a recipient. Pay close attention to the nature of the verb—whether it implies a
    state, movement towards a destination, a recipient, or an action taking place *within* a location—to
    choose the correct particle.

            the recipient of actions like giving, teaching, or telling. We want to emphasize that the students
            are the direct beneficiaries.
      scene: A Japanese teacher is explaining their job to a new acquaintance.

      setting: informative
      speaker_gender: female
      nuance: In this sentence, 「学生 {に}」 clearly marks the students as the indirect object, the recipients

          hint: 「で」 indicates the location where an action takes place, not the destination of arrival.
            Here, 「日本 {に}」 marks the destination of coming. We are focusing on the act of arriving at Japan.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 日本 {へ} 勉強 し {に} 来 まし た。
          english: I came towards Japan to study.
          hint: While 「へ」 can be used for the general direction of movement, 「{に}」 is more precise when
            indicating the specific destination of arrival. For establishing residence or a clear endpoint,
            「{に}」 is preferred.

          english: I came to Japan for the purpose of studying.
          hint: 「ため に」 expresses purpose but is often more formal or emphasizes the *reason*. The verb stem
            + 「{に}」 is a more direct and common way to express the purpose of movement, especially when
            combined with movement verbs.

      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: informative
      speaker_gender: male
      nuance: This example showcases two uses of 「{に}」. The first 「日本 {に}」 specifies Japan as the destination
        of arrival (来る). The second 「勉強 し {に}」 uses the verb stem + 「{に}」 construction to state the purpose
        of coming. The male speaker uses polite language to explain his personal reason for being in Japan.

          hint: While 「で」 indicates the location where an action occurs, 「{に}」 is used to mark the specific
            target or recipient of an action like 'applying' (応募する). The company is the destination of the
            application.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 日本 の 会社 {へ} 応募 し まし た。
          english: I applied towards a Japanese company.
          hint: 「へ」 suggests general direction. For direct actions targeting a specific entity like applying
            to a company, 「{に}」 is more appropriate as it marks the precise destination of the action.
      scene: Someone is discussing their job search experiences after graduating.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: professional
      nuance: In this context, 「会社 {に}」 identifies the company as the direct target or recipient of the
        action 'applied' (応募しました). 「{に}」 is used because the application is directed *to* the company as
        its endpoint.
  post_example_writeup: 'As demonstrated by these examples, the particle に is used for various purposes,
    including indicating the location of existence, the destination of movement, the recipient of an action,
    specific points in time, rates or frequencies, and the target of actions like applying. The core principle
    remains consistent: に marks the endpoint or specific target of the verb''s action or state. Understanding
    this fundamental concept is crucial to mastering its versatile applications.'

    register: teineigo (polite)
    particle-syntactic-function: directional
    usage-context: Used to mark the destination or target of a verb of movement (e.g., 行く, 来る, 帰る), existence
      (e.g., ある, いる), or action that results in a state/location (e.g., 座る, 置く). Also used for indirect
      objects of verbs like あげる (to give) or 貸す (to lend), for specific points in time, and to mark the
      agent in passive and causative-passive constructions.
    function: Indicates direction, destination, location of existence, recipient, point in time, or passive
      agent.
    nuance: While often translated as 'to' or 'toward,' に is more precise, often pinpointing the exact point
      of arrival, contact, or the specific target of an action or state. It's less about the path and more
      about the final spot or recipient.
    grammatical-role: Marks the complement of various verbs.
    temporal-flow: Marks a specific moment or interval for temporal actions.
    spatial-flow: Indicates a specific destination or location of an entity or action.
  etymology: The particle 「に」 originates from the verb 「あり」 (ari), meaning "to exist" or "to be." Over time,
    it evolved to indicate the location where something exists or the direction toward which something moves,
    eventually broadening to denote various targets and points in time.
  writeup: |-
    The particle 「に」 is a fundamental and versatile particle in Japanese, primarily used to indicate the **destination or target** of an action, movement, or state. It functions to pinpoint the precise arrival point for verbs of motion such as 行く (iku - to go), 来る (kuru - to come), and 帰る (kaeru - to return). For example, 「学校{に}行く」 (gakkou ni iku) means "to go to school."

    Beyond movement, 「に」 also marks the **indirect object** of a verb, indicating the recipient of an action, as in 「友達{に}手紙を書く」 (tomodachi ni tegami o kaku - to write a letter to a friend). It can also denote a **specific point in time** when an event occurs, such as 「三時{に}会う」 (sanji ni au - to meet at three o'clock).

    Furthermore, 「に」 is used to specify the **location of existence** for inanimate objects with ある (aru) or animate beings with いる (iru), but only when introducing the existence of something, as in 「机の上{に}本がある」 (tsukue no ue ni hon ga aru - There is a book on the desk). It also marks the **point of contact** for verbs like 座る (suwaru - to sit) or 置く (oku - to put), indicating where something lands or is placed. Lastly, 「に」 is crucial for identifying the **agent** in passive constructions, showing who performed the action, as in 「先生{に}褒められる」 (sensei ni homerareru - to be praised by the teacher).

    Its wide range of uses stems from its historical evolution from a verb meaning "to exist," emphasizing the location or target where something exists or comes to be.

      meaning: at, in, on (location of action); by means of
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: Unlike 「に」, which specifies the destination, precise location of existence, or target of an
        action, 「で」 indicates the general location *where* an action takes place, or the means/method by
        which an action is performed. For example, 「カフェ {で} 勉強 する」 (kafe de benkyou suru - study *at* a
        cafe) vs. 「カフェ {に} 行く」 (kafe ni iku - go *to* a cafe).
      grammar_point: で (location of action)
    - term: へ
      meaning: toward; to
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「へ」 also indicates direction or a destination, it places more emphasis on the *direction*
        or the *path* taken toward a place rather than the specific arrival point. 「に」, in contrast, emphasizes
        the *arrival* at the destination or the specific target. For example, 「東京 {へ} 向かう」 (Tokyo e mukau
        - to head *toward* Tokyo) vs. 「東京 {に} 着く」 (Tokyo ni tsuku - to arrive *at* Tokyo).
      grammar_point: へ (directional particle)
  post_false_friends_writeup: 'To differentiate between 「に」 and 「で」, remember that 「に」 often indicates a
    *point* (destination, time, recipient), while 「で」 indicates a *space* where an action happens or a *tool*
    used for an action. For instance, 「公園 {に} 行く」 (kouen ni iku) means "go *to* the park," focusing on the
    destination. 「公園 {で} 遊ぶ」 (kouen de asobu) means "play *in* the park," focusing on the location of the
    activity. When comparing 「に」 and 「へ」, consider the emphasis: 「へ」 is about the journey or general direction,
    whereas 「に」 is about the end point of that journey.'

          hint: While 「から」 can indicate a source, 「に」 is specifically used to mark the agent of a passive
            verb in Japanese. We're looking for the particle that clearly identifies who performed the action
            in a passive sentence.
      scene: A student proudly tells their parent about a positive school experience.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: informative
      speaker_gender: female
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: In passive voice constructions, 「に」 is used to mark the agent who performs the action, similar
        to 'by' in English. For instance, in 「先生に褒められました」, 「先生に」 indicates that the teacher is the one who
        did the praising. The verb 「褒める」 (homeru - to praise) becomes passive 「褒められる」 (homerareru - to be
        praised), with the past polite form being 「褒められました」 and the casual past form 「褒められた」.

  formation:
    '[Person/Animal] + に + [Action verb]': Indicates the recipient of an action or the target of a verb.
  jlpt: N5
  details:
    part-of-speech: particle
    particle-syntactic-function: case-marking
    function: Indicates the recipient of an action or the target of a verb.
    nuance: The particle 「に」 marks the indirect object, the recipient of an action. It's used to show who
      or what is receiving something.
  etymology: The particle 「に」 has its roots in Old Japanese. Its origins are debated, but it's believed
    to have evolved from earlier forms indicating location or direction. Over time, it broadened to include
    marking indirect objects.
  writeup: 'The particle 「に」 primarily indicates the **recipient of an action**, specifically with transitive
    verbs that involve the transfer of something. This transfer can be a physical object, information, or
    even an emotional state. It highlights *who* or *what* is receiving the action or benefiting from it.
    Common verbs used with this function of 「に」 include, but are not limited to: **あげる / くれる / やる** ("to
    give"), **話す (はなす)** ("to talk/tell"), **見せる (みせる)** ("to show"), **投げる (なげる)** ("to throw"), **教える
    (おしえる)** ("to teach"), **電話する (でんわする)** ("to call"), **書く (かく)** ("to write"), and **貸す (かす)** ("to
    lend"). While 「に」 has other functions, such as indicating location, time, or purpose, in this context,
    its fundamental role is to mark the indirect object: the *to whom* or *for whom* an action is performed.'
  false_friends:
    - term: に (static location・time)
      meaning: In, at, to, for, on (fixed point or target)
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「に」 with benefactive verbs indicates the recipient of an action, this use of 「に」 specifies
        the endpoint or location of movement, implying arrival at a specific place. For instance, 「学校 に
        行く」 (to go to school) uses 「に」 to mark the destination, not a recipient.
      grammar_point: に (static location・time)
    - term: へ (directional particle)
      meaning: Indicates direction or general destination.
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「に」, which specifies a fixed point or recipient, 「へ」 emphasizes the general direction
        of movement. While both can be used for physical movement, 「へ」 focuses on the trajectory, not necessarily
        the arrival, and is never used to mark an indirect object.
      grammar_point: へ (directional particle)
    - term: に (agent・source)
      meaning: by; from (agent in passive voice)
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: This 「に」 marks the agent of an action in a passive sentence, indicating *who* or *what* performed
        the action to the subject, not *who* received something. For example, 「犬 に 噛まれ た」 (I was bitten
        *by* a dog).
      grammar_point: に (agent・source)
    - term: に (purpose)
      meaning: In order to do something; for the purpose of doing something.
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: This 「に」 indicates the purpose for which an action is performed, often seen with movement
        verbs like 「行く」 or 「来る」. It describes the *reason* for movement, not who is receiving something.
        For instance, 「買い物 に 行く」 (to go *for* shopping).
      grammar_point: に (purpose)
    - term: と (with)
      meaning: With; And (exhaustive listing); As (comparison)
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「に」 marks the recipient of an action, 「と」 often indicates accompaniment ('with') or
        something done 'together' with someone. For example, 「友達 と 話す」 means to talk *with* a friend, implying
        a two-way conversation, whereas 「友達 に 話す」 means to talk *to* a friend, making them the recipient
        of your words.
      grammar_point: と (with)
  post_false_friends_writeup: Both 「に」 and 「へ」 can indicate a destination. However, 「に」 denotes a specific
    point or the direct recipient of an action, implying arrival or direct interaction. 「へ」, on the other
    hand, highlights the general direction of movement, without necessarily implying arrival at the destination.
    When referring to the recipient of an action, only 「に」 is used. The particle 「に」 also has other distinct
    functions, such as marking the agent in a passive sentence or the purpose of an action, which should
    not be confused with its role as a recipient marker. Consider whether the emphasis is on the *destination/recipient*,
    the *direction*, the *agent*, or the *purpose* to choose the correct usage of 「に」 or 「へ」.

    person or entity that receives an action or information. Pay close attention to the verb used, as it
    often dictates whether 「に」 functions as a recipient marker or something else.
