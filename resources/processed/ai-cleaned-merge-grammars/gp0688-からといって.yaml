        "usage-context": "Used to express that an action or reason is not sufficient to justify a conclusion or expectation. Often implies criticism or a strong opinion.",
        "function": "To state that a given condition or reason does not necessarily lead to an expected or logical outcome.",
        "nuance": "Implies a negative connotation or a contradiction of expectations. Can also be used to challenge a common misconception or a flimsy excuse. Can be colloquialized to からとて or からって。"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「からといって」 is derived from 「から」 (from/because), 「と」 (quotative particle), and the 「て」-form of the verb 「言う」 (to say). Literally, it means \"from saying that,\" implying that just because something is stated or is the case, it doesn't automatically lead to a certain conclusion.",
    "writeup": "「からといって」 is used to express that **just because** something is true, it does not necessarily mean that a certain conclusion or expectation is also true. It's often used to express a **strong opinion** or **criticism**. The structure is 「A からといって、B」, where A is the reason or condition, and B is the statement that doesn't necessarily follow. It can be translated as \"Just because A, doesn't mean B\" or \"Even if A, it doesn't mean B.\"\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   「からといって」 can be abbreviated to 「からとて」 or 「からって」 in more colloquial speech, without changing the meaning.\n*   This grammar point often implies a negative connotation or a contradiction of expectations in the 'B' part of the sentence.\n*   「からといって」 may appear after verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns that are followed by だ.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「からといって」, 「ばかりに」 often implies a negative consequence directly resulting from the stated reason. 「ばかりに」 focuses on the direct, often unfortunate, outcome."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The main difference between 「からといって」 and 「ばかりに」 lies in the nuance and emphasis. 「からといって」 is used to negate a direct correlation between two things, expressing that one does not automatically lead to the other. 「ばかりに」, on the other hand, emphasizes that something happened *specifically because* of the reason stated, often with a negative result. Thus, when choosing which to use, consider whether you want to dispute a direct connection or highlight a direct consequence.",
