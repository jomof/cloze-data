    "etymology": "「だが」 is a conjunction formed from 「だ」 (the plain form of 「です」, a copula indicating affirmation) and 「が」 (a conjunction indicating contrast). 「ですが」 is simply the polite form, using 「です」 instead of 「だ」.",
    "writeup": "「だが」 and 「ですが」 function as conjunctions to express contrast or contradiction, much like \"but\" or \"however\" in English. They convey a formal and direct opposition between two statements. Think of it as saying, \"That may be true, **but**...\" 「だが」 serves as the plain form, suitable for more formal or literary contexts, while 「ですが」 is its polite counterpart. When using 「ですが」, it is essential to maintain polite speech throughout the rest of the sentence, as it incorporates 「です」. In contemporary Japanese, the practice of adding 「ね」 after 「だが」 to soften its tone is not common and is more typical of older generations. For casual conversation, 「でも」 is generally preferred over 「だが」 due to the latter's somewhat stiff impression.",
