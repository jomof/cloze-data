    "etymology": "「だらけ」 likely stems from the verb 「だらける」, which means to be lazy or sloppy. This connection suggests that a state of being 「だらけ」 implies a messy, undesirable condition, often due to a lack of care or attention.",
    "writeup": "「だらけ」 is a suffix used to express that something is \"covered in\" or \"full of\" something else. It directly attaches to nouns. Most often, it implies that the substance or item it is covered in is undesirable, negative, or present in an excessive amount.When 「だらけ」 is followed by the particle 「の」, it modifies another noun. For instance, 「ゴミだらけの部屋」 (a room full of garbage).The noun following 「の」 can be omitted if the context is clear.Important Considerations「だらけ」 is typically used to describe things that are scattered or spread out. Therefore, it might sound unnatural when used to describe something uniformly covered, unless that scattered quality is inherently implied (e.g., small holes or scratches). For example, to say a wall is 「ペンキだらけ」 (covered in paint) would imply scattered drops or smudges, not a smooth, even coat.It generally carries a negative connotation, indicating an undesirable state. Consequently, it is usually not used to describe something covered with a desirable substance, unless the speaker deliberately intends to convey an *overwhelming* or *excessive* amount, even if generally positive, to achieve a specific nuanced effect.",
