  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to express the purpose behind an action or the reason/cause for a situation, depending
    on the preceding word form and context.
  function: Connects an action or state to its purpose, goal, or the reason/cause for its occurrence.
  nuance: When expressing purpose, it highlights a conscious, volitional action. When expressing reason/cause,
    it emphasizes the objective factor or characteristic leading to an outcome, particularly for past
    events or inherent traits. It is generally more formal and objective than common causal particles
    like から or ので.
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially, modifying the main clause by providing purpose or reason.
  logical-flow: Establishes a direct causal link or purpose-driven relationship between a preceding condition/action
    and a subsequent outcome/action.
  temporal-flow: For purpose, the action in the main clause is undertaken to achieve a future goal. For
    reason, the cause precedes or is concurrent with the effect.
etymology: The word 「為 (ため)」 is fundamentally a noun meaning 'sake,' 'benefit,' or 'purpose.' Its evolution
  into a grammatical construction, often paired with the particle 「に」, reflects its dual capacity to express
  both the intended goal of an action (purpose) and the underlying cause or reason for a situation. Historically,
  the concept of 'for the sake of' naturally extended to 'because of,' as something done 'for the sake
  of' a reason leads to a result. The optional 「に」 further solidifies this adverbial function, clarifying
  whether the preceding clause serves as a goal or a contributing factor.
writeup: 'The grammatical structure 「ため(に)」 is derived from the noun 「為 (ため)」, meaning ''sake'' or ''benefit''.
  It serves to connect a preceding clause or word to a subsequent clause, indicating either the **purpose**
  for which an action is performed or the **reason/cause** for a particular state or event. The presence
  or absence of the particle 「に」 is optional, but its inclusion often strengthens the sense of purpose
  or a direct cause-and-effect relationship.When 「ため(に)」 expresses **purpose** (in order to, for the sake
  of), the action described in the main clause is always a deliberate and volitional one. It typically
  follows: *   **Verbs in their dictionary (plain non-past) form**: For example, 日本語が上手になる**ため に** (in
  order to become good at Japanese). *   **Nouns followed by の**: For example, 家族の**ため に** (for the sake
  of family). When 「ため(に)」 expresses **reason** or **cause** (because of, due to), it can convey an objective
  or factual reason for something. This usage is broad and can follow various word types: *   **Verbs
  in their plain form (non-past or past)**: When a verb is in the **past tense**, it *exclusively* denotes
  reason/cause. For instance, 大雪だった**ため に** (because it was heavy snow) or 仕事が終わらなかった**ため に** (because
  work didn''t finish). *   **い-adjectives in their plain form**: For example, 環境に良い**ため に** (because
  it''s good for the environment). *   **な-adjectives followed by な**: For example, 不安な**ため に** (because
  she was anxious). *   **Nouns followed by の**: For example, 予期せぬ故障の**ため に** (due to an unexpected breakdown).
  Compared to other causal expressions like 「から」 and 「ので」, 「ため(に)」 tends to be more formal and objective,
  making it suitable for explanations of factual causes or consequences, or when a stronger, more direct
  causal link is implied.'

post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share some conceptual overlap with 「ため(に)」, recognizing
  their distinct nuances is crucial for accurate and natural Japanese. 「ため(に)」 serves as a versatile tool
  for stating both purpose and reason, emphasizing the direct connection between a preceding action/state
  and its consequence or goal. Other expressions might imply conditions, conclusions, or different levels
  of formality. Pay close attention to the connotation, formality, and specific type of causal or purpose
  relationship each expression conveys.

          direct, objective reason for something.
    scene: A maintenance worker posts a notice about equipment that is out of order.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「予期せぬ 故障」 (unexpected breakdown) is the clear, objective cause. The use of 「ために」 here provides
      a neutral, factual explanation for the machine's unavailability, common in official notices or reports.
      「使用できません」 is the formal expression, while 「使えません」 is a more direct and slightly less formal but
      still polite way to say the same thing.
  - english: Because I've been busy lately, I don't have time for my hobbies.
    japanese:
      - 最近 忙しい {ため に}、趣味 の 時間 が あり ませ ん。
      - 最近 忙しい {ため に}、趣味 の 時間 が ない ん です。
      - 最近 忙しい {ため に}、趣味 の 時間 が ない。
    english_literally: Lately busy's reason, hobby time does not exist.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最近 忙しい {の で}、趣味 の 時間 が あり ませ ん。
        english: Because I've been busy lately, I don't have time for my hobbies.
        hint: 「ので」 is a general causal conjunction. 「ため に」, even in casual settings, carries a slightly
          more formal or emphatic nuance when stating a clear cause-and-effect. We're looking for a slightly
          more formal or emphatic way to state the reason.
    scene: A student laments to a friend about their lack of free time.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「忙しい」 (busy) is the direct cause of the lack of hobby time. This expresses a personal feeling
      of busyness and its direct impact on one's life. 「ありません」 is polite, while 「ない ん です」 offers a slightly
      more explanatory and casual tone, and 「ない」 is the plain, most casual form.
  - english: Because he is diligent, he always works responsibly.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 真面目 な {ため に}、いつ も 責任 を 持っ て 仕事 を し ます。
      - 彼 は 真面目 な {ため に}、いつ も 責任 を 持っ て 仕事 を し て い ます。
      - 彼 は 真面目 な {ため に}、いつ も 責任 感 を 持っ て 仕事 を し ます。
    english_literally: He is diligent's reason, always with responsibility work he does.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 真面目 だ {から}、いつ も 責任 を 持っ て 仕事 を し ます。
        english: Because he is diligent, he always works responsibly.
        hint: 「から」 is a common, direct way to state a reason, but 「ため に」 emphasizes a characteristic or
          inherent quality as the objective reason for a consistent outcome. We're looking for a way to
          highlight an inherent trait as the cause.
    scene: A manager is describing a good employee to a new team member.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「真面目な」 (diligent/serious) highlights a positive trait as the cause for his responsible work.
      「ため に」 here describes a characteristic that directly leads to an outcome. It's a neutral, almost
      factual observation. The progressive form 「して います」 emphasizes the continuous nature of his work,
      while 「責任感」 (sense of responsibility) emphasizes the feeling rather than the act.
  - english: Because I drank too much last night, I have a terrible hangover this morning.
    japanese:
      - 昨夜、飲み すぎ た {ため に}、今朝 は ひどい 二 日 酔い です。
      - 昨夜、飲み すぎ た {ため に}、今朝 は ひどい 二 日 酔い だ。
      - 昨夜、飲み すぎ た {ため に}、今朝 は ひどい 二 日 酔い に なっ ちゃっ た。
    english_literally: Last night, drank too much's reason, this morning is a terrible two-day-sickness.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨夜、飲み すぎ た {せい で}、今朝 は ひどい 二 日 酔い です。
        english: Because I drank too much last night (and it's someone's fault), I have a terrible hangover
          this morning.
        hint: While both can indicate cause, 「せい で」 strongly implies a negative consequence due to someone's
          fault or a negative external factor. 「ため に」 is more neutral. We're looking for a more neutral
          statement of cause and effect.
    scene: A man calls his friends to say he can't make it to their morning plans due to a hangover.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「飲みすぎた」 (drank too much) is the direct cause of the hangover. 「ひどい 二日酔いです」 (terrible hangover)
      expresses the severe consequence. This statement is common in casual settings when explaining a
      self-inflicted negative outcome. The use of 「です」 keeps it polite but the content is casual. 「だ」
      is the plain form, making it even more casual. 「なっちゃった」 emphasizes the unfortunate outcome in a
      more colloquial way.
  - english: Due to heavy snow, the trains are significantly delayed.
    japanese:
      - 大雪 の {ため に}、電車 が 大幅 に 遅れ て い ます。
      - 大雪 の {ため に}、電車 に 大幅 な 遅れ が 生じ て い ます。
      - 大雪 の {ため に}、電車 が 大幅 に 運行 を 遅らせ て い ます。
    english_literally: Heavy snow's reason, train is significantly delayed.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 大雪 {に よっ て}、電車 が 大幅 に 遅れ て い ます。
        english: Due to heavy snow, the trains are significantly delayed.
        hint: Both 「ために」 and 「によって」 are used for formal announcements of causes. However, 「ために」 often
          describes a direct cause, while 「によって」 can also imply a means or agent. We're looking for a
          direct, objective cause.
    scene: A train station announcement informing passengers about delays.
    register: formal
    setting: emergency/alarm
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「大雪」 (heavy snow) is the objective and impactful cause. 「大幅に 遅れています」 (significantly delayed)
      describes the severe consequence. This usage is typical for factual public announcements of events
      outside human control. 「遅れ が 生じ て い ます」 uses a more formal verb for 'occurrence of delay', and 「運行
      を 遅らせ て い ます」 specifies 'delaying operation', both common in official announcements.
  - english: Because that room is small, there's no space to put furniture.
    japanese:
      - その 部屋 は 狭い {ため に}、家具 を 置く 場所 が あり ませ ん。
      - その 部屋 は 狭い {ため に}、家具 を 置く 場所 が ない。
      - その 部屋 は 狭い {ため に}、家具 を 置く スペース が ない よ。
    english_literally: That room is narrow's reason, furniture to put place does not exist.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 部屋 は 狭い {の で}、家具 を 置く 場所 が あり ませ ん。
        english: Because that room is small, there's no space to put furniture.
        hint: 「ので」 is a general causal conjunction. 「ため に」, even in casual settings, emphasizes an inherent
          characteristic (being small) as the objective reason for the resulting lack of space. We're
          looking for a clearer cause-and-effect based on an inherent property.
    scene: A friend is showing another friend their new apartment and explaining why it's difficult to
      furnish.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「狭い」 (small/narrow) is the inherent characteristic. 「家具を 置く 場所が ありません」 (no space to put furniture)
      is the direct consequence. This is a common, relatable scenario. 「ありません」 is polite. 「ない」 is the
      plain form. 「スペース が ない よ」 uses the English loanword for 'space' and the casual sentence-ending particle
      「よ」, common in conversational settings.
  - english: Because he is clumsy, he is bad at detailed work.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 不 器用 な {ため に}、細かい 作業 が 苦手 です。
      - 彼 は 不 器用 な {ため に}、細かい 作業 を 苦手 と し て い ます。
      - 彼 は 不 器用 な {ため に}、細かい 作業 が 得意 で は あり ませ ん。
    english_literally: He is clumsy's reason, detailed work he is bad at.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 不 器用 な {せい で}、細かい 作業 が 苦手 です。
        english: Because he is clumsy (and it's a negative thing), he is bad at detailed work.
        hint: While both can indicate cause, 「せい で」 specifically implies a negative outcome or something
          to blame. 「ため に」 presents the characteristic more neutrally as an objective reason. We're looking
          for a more neutral and objective statement of the reason.
    scene: A colleague is discussing another colleague's strengths and weaknesses.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「不器用な」 (clumsy/awkward) describes a personal characteristic leading to a certain inability.
      「苦手です」 (is bad at) indicates a weakness. While 「せい で」 could also be used for a negative outcome,
      「ため に」 presents it as a more neutral, inherent characteristic leading to the consequence. 「苦手 と
      し て い ます」 is a slightly more formal way to express 'is bad at something'. 「得意 で は あり ませ ん」 is a
      polite, indirect way to say 'is not good at', using the antonym.
  - english: Because I studied hard, I was able to get a high score on the exam.
    japanese:
      - よく 勉強 し た {ため に}、試験 で 高い 点数 を 取れ まし た。
      - よく 勉強 し た {ため に}、試験 で 高い 点数 を 取る こと が でき まし た。
      - よく 勉強 し た {ため に}、試験 で 高い 点数 を 獲得 でき まし た。
    english_literally: Studied hard's reason, on the exam high score was able to get.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - よく 勉強 し た {おかげ で}、試験 で 高い 点数 を 取れ まし た。
        english: Thanks to studying hard, I was able to get a high score on the exam.
        hint: 「おかげで」 specifically implies gratitude or a positive outcome due to a beneficial cause. 「ため
          に」 is more neutral, stating the direct cause-and-effect relationship. We're looking for a neutral
          statement of cause and effect, not necessarily expressing gratitude.
    scene: A student reflecting on their exam results.
    register: formal
    setting: excited
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「よく 勉強した」 (studied hard) is the direct effort leading to the positive result. While 「おかげで」
      emphasizes gratitude, 「ため に」 focuses more on the direct causal link, stating the achievement as
      a natural consequence of the action. 「取る こと が でき まし た」 explicitly uses the 'can do' structure 「~こと
      が できる」. 「獲得 でき まし た」 uses 「獲得」 (かく と く - acquire, gain) which is a more formal verb for 'getting
      points'.
  - english: Due to the introduction of a new system, the service will be temporarily suspended.
    japanese:
      - 新しい システム 導入 の {ため に}、一時 的 に サービス が 停止 し ます。
      - 新しい システム 導入 の {ため に}、一時 的 に サービス が 停止 さ せ て いただき ます。
      - 新しい システム 導入 の {ため に}、一時 的 に サービス の ご 利用 を 停止 さ せ て いただき ます。
    english_literally: New system introduction's reason, temporarily service will stop.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい システム 導入 {に つき}、一時 的 に サービス が 停止 し ます。
        english: Due to the introduction of a new system, the service will be temporarily suspended.
        hint: 「につき」 is a very formal expression used in announcements or official documents to state a
          reason. While 「ため に」 is also formal and objective, 「につき」 is often found in printed notices.
          We're looking for a common expression for announcements.
    scene: A company announces a temporary service interruption.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「新しい システム 導入」 (new system introduction) is the direct, objective cause. 「一時的に サービスが 停止します」
      (service will be temporarily suspended) is the factual consequence. 「ため に」 is used here in a formal,
      informative context, typical for public or internal announcements. 「停止 さ せ て いただき ます」 uses humble
      language (させて いただく) common in company announcements for actions they are taking. 「サービス の ご 利用 を
      停止 さ せ て いただき ます」 adds further politeness by referring to the customer's 'use of service' (ご利用).
post_example_writeup: When using 「ため(に)」 for purpose, the main clause describes a deliberate action. When
  it expresses reason or cause, it simply states why something happened or is the case. Pay close attention
  to the form of the word preceding 「ため(に)」 to correctly interpret its meaning, especially if the preceding
  verb is in the past tense, which strongly suggests a reason or cause rather than a purpose.
