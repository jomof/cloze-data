jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Often used colloquially to express annoyance or frustration about someone's actions,
    or to refer to deliberate acts of mischief/vandalism. It can imply negligence or intentional wrongdoing.
  function: Expresses negative action, misbehavior, or causing a problem.
  nuance: Implies a problematic outcome or a lack of consideration from the person performing the action.
    Can sometimes be used with a slight sense of mischief or deliberate naughtiness.
  grammatical-role: Main verb, indicating an action with negative implications.
etymology: The verb 「やる」 originally meant 'to send' or 'to give' (often to someone inferior or to animals),
  and later broadened to 'to do' or 'to perform'. In modern colloquial usage, when used intransitively
  or in certain contexts, it gained the nuance of 'to mess up' or 'to cause trouble,' evolving from the
  idea of 'doing something' that then leads to a problematic situation. This reflects a shift from a neutral
  action to one with a negative connotation.
writeup: |-
  The verb 「やる」 is a versatile word in Japanese, and when used in the context of "to cause trouble" or "to mess up," it takes on a specific colloquial nuance. It implies that the action performed by the subject results in an undesirable outcome, inconvenience, or outright mischief.

  This usage of 「やる」 often carries a sense of frustration or annoyance on the part of the speaker. It can describe actions ranging from minor missteps, like spilling a drink, to more deliberate acts of misbehavior, like playing a prank or causing damage.

  It's crucial to understand that this specific meaning of 「やる」 isn't always explicitly stated; it's inferred from context. For instance, if someone sighs and says 「また やった」, it's understood that they've made a mistake or caused a problem, rather than simply "done something."

  While 「やる」 can be a neutral verb meaning "to do" (similar to 「する」), this particular usage emphasizes the negative consequence or the troublesome nature of the act. It's frequently heard in casual conversation, especially when complaining about someone's behavior or commenting on a regrettable incident.
false_friends:
  - term: する
    meaning: to do (general, neutral)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「する」 is a neutral verb for performing an action, whereas 「やる」 in this context specifically
      implies an action with a negative or troublesome outcome. 「する」 does not carry the inherent negative
      connotation of 「やる」.
    grammar_point: する (to do・make)
  - term: 迷惑をかける
    meaning: to cause trouble/inconvenience
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「迷惑をかける」 is a more formal and explicit expression for causing trouble, often used to apologize
      or describe a situation directly. 「やる」 is more colloquial and can imply a deliberate or negligent
      act of mischief, or just a general 'messing up'.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:迷惑をかける (to cause trouble)
  - term: しでかす
    meaning: to mess up, to make a major mistake
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「しでかす」 often implies a significant blunder or a grave error, usually unintentional, leading
      to serious consequences. 「やる」 can be used for more minor, mischievous, or deliberate acts of causing
      trouble, and doesn't always imply a 'major' mistake.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:しでかす (to mess up)
  - term: 悪さをする
    meaning: to do mischief, to misbehave
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「悪さをする」 is commonly used for children's misbehavior or mischievous acts and generally implies
      less severe consequences than 「やる」 might imply in some contexts. 「やる」 can be used for both minor
      mischief and more serious acts of trouble-making.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:悪さをする (to do mischief)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「する」 is a general verb for 'to do,' 「やる」, when used to mean 'to cause
  trouble,' carries a distinct negative implication or a sense of having made a mistake. Unlike the more
  formal 「迷惑をかける」, 「やる」 is casual and can convey frustration. It differs from 「しでかす」 in that it doesn't
  necessarily imply a major, often unintentional, blunder, and from 「悪さをする」, which often specifically
  refers to childish mischief. Understanding these nuances helps in choosing the most appropriate expression
  for the context.

        english: Oh no, I've spilled coffee on the report again!
        hint: 「〜てしまう」 emphasizes completion and often regret for an action. While similar, 「やった」 here

        english: Oh no, I've stained the report again!

    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    conjugation: past plain (～た)

    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The direct negative command with 「やらないで」 suggests a firm warning against problematic behavior.

      and less polite than 「かけないで」.

    scene: Two colleagues discreetly discussing a third colleague's performance.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The use of 「やったらしい」 maintains a slightly formal distance while conveying the rumor that someone
      'caused trouble' or 'messed up' the project. 「〜らしい」 indicates hearsay or apparent truth.
  - english: Don't you dare do anything strange!
    japanese:
      - 変 な こと {やら ない} で ください ね！

    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「やらないでくださいね」 uses the polite negative imperative, but with 「やる」 carrying the connotation of
      'causing trouble' or 'doing something problematic.' The 「ね」 softens the command slightly, seeking
      agreement or understanding from the students.
  - english: It seems someone did something naughty last night.
    japanese:

      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 の 夜、誰 か が いたずら を し た みたい だ。
        english: Last night, someone did mischief, it seems.
        hint: 「する」 is general 'to do'. 「やった」 here subtly implies that the mischief caused a nuisance or
          had a negative impact, making it more about 'causing trouble' than just 'doing' it.
    scene: A resident discovers a prank has been pulled in their apartment building overnight.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: Used with 「いたずら (mischief)」, 「やった」 implies the act of having completed the mischief, with

          - きっと みんな に 迷惑 を かけ ます。
        english: I'm sure I'll cause trouble for everyone.
        hint: 「かける」 is the standard verb to use with 「迷惑」. 「やります」 here is a less common but possible polite
          form, perhaps used for a slightly more informal or self-deprecating tone.
    scene: A nervous new intern expressing anxiety about being a burden.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: While 「迷惑をかける」 is standard, using 「迷惑をやります」 with the polite form indicates a self-deprecating
      or humble tone, anticipating oneself 'doing' trouble to others. This might be used by someone who
      is self-aware of their potential to be clumsy or inexperienced.
  - english: He's the type who just does whatever he wants without thinking.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 何 も 考え ず に 好き 勝手 に {やる} タイプ だ。

      - 彼 は 何 も 考え ず に 好き 勝手 に {やる} やつ だ。
    english_literally: He, without thinking anything, as he pleases, does (trouble) type is.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 何 も 考え ず に 好き 勝手 に 行動 する タイプ だ。
        english: He's the type who just acts as he pleases without thinking.
        hint: 「行動する」 means 'to act' or 'to behave'. 「やる」 here implies that his actions, done without thinking,
          often result in negative consequences or trouble for others.
    scene: A manager describing a difficult employee during a team meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The phrase 「好き勝手にやる」 implies someone acts without considering others, often leading to problems.
      The neutral dictionary form 「やる」 is used to describe a general characteristic of the person, fitting
      the informative and somewhat critical tone of a formal setting.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「やる」, in the context of causing trouble, can be applied
  to various situations, from accidental mishaps to deliberate mischief or general problematic behavior.
  Notice how the nuance of "causing trouble" is often conveyed through the surrounding context, such as
  phrases like 「迷惑をかける」 (to cause inconvenience), or simply by the negative outcome implied by the situation
  itself. It's a versatile, albeit informal, way to express that an action has led to an undesirable result.
  The choice of plain versus polite forms also reflects the speaker's relationship with the listener and
  the formality of the situation.
