pronunciation:
  katakana: ヤル
  romaji: yaru
formation:
  Verb in Te-form + やる: Indicates performing an action with the intention or awareness that it will cause
    trouble or difficulty for the recipient.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  function: Indicates that the speaker performs an action knowing it will cause trouble, difficulty, or
    inconvenience for the recipient. Often implies a sense of spite, condescension, or deliberate imposition.
  colocation: Often used with verbs expressing negative actions or actions that can be perceived negatively,
    such as 叱る (shikaru - to scold), 困らせる (komaraseru - to trouble), 食う (kuu - to eat, informally), 報告する
    (houkoku suru - to report).
  grammatical-role: Functions as an auxiliary verb, attaching to the te-form of a preceding verb to add
    nuance to the main action.
etymology: The auxiliary verb 「やる」 is derived from the verb 「やる」 meaning "to do" or "to give (to someone
  of lower status)." In this usage, it retains the sense of "doing" something, but with the added nuance
  of intentionally causing trouble for the recipient. The original "giving" aspect is twisted to imply
  giving someone a hard time, or a consequence, rather than a favor.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「～てやる」 is an auxiliary verb construction used when the speaker performs an action, fully aware that it will cause trouble, difficulty, or inconvenience for another person. This often conveys a sense of spite, condescension, or deliberate imposition on the part of the speaker.

  This expression is typically used in casual settings and can be perceived as rude or aggressive, especially if directed towards superiors or strangers. Its use often indicates the speaker's frustration or negative emotions towards the recipient of the action.

  While not exclusively gender-specific, 「～てやる」 is more commonly used by male speakers. It should be used with caution, as it can sound harsh depending on the context and relationship between speakers.
false_friends:
  - term: くれる
    meaning: to give (to me or someone close to me)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「～てやる」 (where the action often causes trouble for the recipient), 「～てくれる」 means someone
      does something for the speaker or someone close to them, indicating a favor or act of kindness.
    grammar_point: 呉れる・くれる (give)
  - term: もらう
    meaning: to receive
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「～てやる」 (where the speaker performs the action with intent to cause trouble), 「～てもらう」
      means the speaker receives an action from someone else. It emphasizes the act of receiving rather
      than imposing or causing trouble.
    grammar_point: もらう (have someone do)
  - term: てあげる
    meaning: to do (a favor for someone of equal or lower status)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「～てやる」, 「～てあげる」 implies doing something as a favor or benefit to the recipient, even
      if they are of a lower status. It lacks the negative or spiteful connotation of causing trouble.
    grammar_point: てあげる (to do for someone)
  - term: する
    meaning: to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「～てやる」, the simple verb 「～する」 expresses the action itself without any added nuance
      of intentionally causing trouble or difficulty for someone else. It is a neutral expression.
    grammar_point: する (to do・make)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「～てやる」 implies the speaker's deliberate intent to cause trouble for the recipient.
  This contrasts with other constructions like 「～てくれる」 and 「～てもらう」, which involve acts of kindness or
  receiving actions. Similarly, 「～てあげる」 denotes performing a favor, while the simple 「～する」 is a neutral
  description of an action. Understanding these subtle differences in nuance is crucial for correct usage.
examples:
  - english: I'll finish that mean boss's documents during his busiest time.
    japanese:
      - 意地 悪 な 上司 の 資料、忙しい 時間 に {仕上げ て やる}。
      - 意地 悪 な 上司 の 資料、忙しい 時間 に {仕上げ て やり ます}。
    english_literally: I'll finish the mean boss's documents (causing him trouble) during his busiest
      time.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 意地 悪 な 上司 の 資料、忙しい 時間 に 仕上げる。
        english: I'll finish that mean boss's documents during his busiest time (neutral tone).
        hint: The simple plain form of 「仕上げる」 indicates completion of the task without the specific nuance
          of causing trouble or inconvenience to someone. We're looking for an action that implies doing
          something knowing it will cause difficulty.
    scene: An employee is fed up with their demanding boss and decides to submit a task at the most inconvenient
      moment for the boss.
    register: casual
    setting: sarcastic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「仕上げてやる」 expresses the male speaker's malicious intent to cause inconvenience for
      their "mean boss" (意地 悪 な 上司) by completing the documents at the busiest time. This makes the action
      not a helpful one, but a subtly troublesome one. The use of 「～てやる」 by a male speaker can emphasize
      a sense of dominance or defiance.
  - english: Because he didn't contact me for ages, I went ahead and ate his pudding.
    japanese:
      - ず っと 連絡 し なかっ た から、彼氏 の プリン を 勝手 に {食べ て やっ た}。
      - ず っと 連絡 し なかっ た から、彼氏 の プリン を 勝手 に {食べ て やり まし た}。
    english_literally: Because he didn't contact me for ages, I ate his pudding (as revenge).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ず っと 連絡 し なかっ た から、彼氏 の プリン を 勝手 に 食べ た。
        english: Because he didn't contact me for ages, I ate his pudding (neutral action).
        hint: The simple past form of 「食べる」 states a fact without conveying the speaker's retaliatory
          or spiteful intent. We're looking for an action taken out of annoyance or petty revenge.
    scene: A young woman is annoyed with her boyfriend for ghosting her, so she takes a small, petty revenge.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「食べ て やっ た」 (ate) conveys the speaker's petty retaliation against her boyfriend
      for not contacting her. The use of 「勝手 に」 (arbitrarily/without permission) further highlights the
      deliberate nature of this small act of vengeance. While 「～てやる」 often has a masculine connotation,
      it's used here in a casual, somewhat humorous context between close partners, demonstrating its
      versatility.
  - english: That guy made a fool of me again. Next time, I'll completely argue him down.
    japanese:
      - あいつ、また 私 を 馬鹿 に し た な。今度 は 徹底 的 に {言い負かし て やろう}。
      - あいつ、また 私 を 馬鹿 に し た な。今度 は 徹底 的 に {言い負かし て やり ましょう}。
    english_literally: That guy made a fool of me again. Next time, I intend to completely argue him down
      (causing him trouble).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あいつ、また 私 を 馬鹿 に し た な。今度 は 徹底 的 に 言い負かす ぞ。
        english: That guy made a fool of me again. Next time, I'll completely argue him down! (strong
          assertion)
        hint: While 「～ぞ」 adds a strong assertion, it doesn't carry the specific nuance of doing something
          intentionally to cause trouble or humiliation for the other person in the same way 「～てやろう」 does.
          We're looking for a strong determination to inflict defeat.
    scene: A man is frustrated after being belittled by someone and vows to get his verbal revenge.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: volitional (～よう)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The volitional form 「言い負かし て やろう」 expresses the male speaker's strong determination to verbally
      defeat the other person. The phrase 「徹底 的 に」 (thoroughly/completely) amplifies the intent to cause
      significant distress or humiliation to the opponent, which is characteristic of the aggressive nuance
      of 「～てやる」.
  - english: If they don't listen to my instructions for that project, I won't help them anymore.
    japanese:
      - あの プロジェクト、私 の 指示 を 聞か ない の なら、もう {手伝っ て やら ない}。
      - あの プロジェクト、私 の 指示 を 聞か ない の なら、もう {手伝っ て やり ませ ん}。
    english_literally: If they don't listen to my instructions for that project, I will no longer help
      them (causing them trouble).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの プロジェクト、私 の 指示 を 聞か ない の なら、もう 手伝い ませ ん。
        english: If they don't listen to my instructions for that project, I will no longer help them
          (polite refusal).
        hint: 「手伝い ませ ん」 is a polite refusal to help, but it doesn't convey the deliberate intent to cause
          trouble or make things difficult as a consequence. We're looking for a refusal that implies
          imposing a negative consequence.
    scene: A team leader is frustrated with a subordinate who consistently ignores directives and decides
      to withdraw support, knowing it will make the subordinate's task harder.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: 「手伝っ て やら ない」 (will not help) indicates a deliberate decision to cease assistance, with the
      clear implication that this will cause trouble or difficulty for the recipient. The phrase 「私 の
      指示 を 聞か ない の なら」 (if they don't listen to my instructions) provides the justification for this punitive
      action, framing it as a consequence of their disobedience.
  - english: If your subordinate has no motivation, why don't you try disciplining them strictly once?
    japanese:
      - 部下 が 全然 やる気 が ない なら、一 度 厳しく {指導 し て やっ たら} どう だ？
      - 部下 が 全然 やる気 が ない なら、一 度 厳しく {指導 し て やれ ば} どう だ？
    english_literally: If your subordinate has no motivation at all, how about disciplining them strictly
      (to make them understand)?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 部下 が 全然 やる気 が ない なら、一 度 厳しく 指導 し たら どう だ？
        english: If your subordinate has no motivation at all, how about disciplining them strictly once?
          (neutral advice)
        hint: The conditional 「～たら」 without 「～てやる」 gives neutral advice. Here, the advice suggests a stern
          approach intended to cause discomfort for the subordinate's benefit. We're looking for advice
          that implies a strong, potentially unpleasant, corrective action.
    scene: An older, experienced manager advises a younger manager on how to deal with an unmotivated
      subordinate.
    register: formal
    setting: persuasive
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The conditional form 「指導 し て やっ たら」 suggests a course of action that involves applying pressure
      or sternness to the subordinate. The phrase 「厳しく」 (strictly/harsly) combined with the nuance of
      「～てやる」 implies that this "guidance" is intended to cause the subordinate discomfort or a wake-up
      call, ultimately for their own good, but still with an element of imposing difficulty. This kind
      of advice might be given by an older, more seasoned mentor.
  - english: I'll tell him off a bit strongly for always being late.
    japanese:
      - いつ も 遅れ て くる 彼 に、少し きつめ に {言っ て やり ます} よ。
      - いつ も 遅れ て くる 彼 に、少し きつめ に {言っ て やる} よ。
    english_literally: I'll say it to him a bit strongly (causing him trouble) for always being late.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - いつ も 遅れ て くる 彼 に、少し きつめ に 言い ます よ。
        english: I'll tell him off a bit strongly for always being late (polite, direct statement).
        hint: 「言い ます」 is a polite statement of intent, but it lacks the underlying nuance of intending
          to cause discomfort or a strong reaction in the recipient. We're looking for a statement that
          implies a confrontational or imposing tone.
    scene: A colleague, frustrated by a habitually late team member, decides to speak to them about it,
      anticipating a confrontational conversation.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: Even in the polite 「～ます」 form, 「言っ て やり ます」 carries the underlying nuance of deliberate imposition
      or causing discomfort. The phrase 「きつめ に」 (strongly/harsly) reinforces that the action is intended
      to be unpleasant for the recipient, making the politeness somewhat ironic or passive-aggressive,
      common in workplace dynamics.
  - english: Don't say such weak things; just finish it quickly!
    japanese:
      - そんな 弱い こと 言っ て ない で、早く 終わら せ て {しまっ て やれ}！
      - そんな 弱い こと 言っ て ない で、早く 終わら せ て {しまっ て やり なさい}！
    english_literally: Don't say such weak things; just finish it quickly (and be done with the trouble)!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな 弱い こと 言っ て ない で、早く 終わら せ て しまい なさい！
        english: Don't say such weak things; please finish it quickly! (polite command)
        hint: 「～なさい」 is a polite imperative, suggesting a milder command. The context here demands a forceful,
          almost aggressive command that pushes the listener through difficulty. We're looking for a strong,
          direct command that implies forcing someone to endure or complete a difficult task.
    scene: A frustrated male coach shouts at a male athlete who is complaining about a tough training
      regimen.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The imperative 「しまっ て やれ」 is a very direct, forceful command, typically used by men to other
      men in casual or demanding contexts. It implies that the speaker is pushing the listener to overcome
      a difficult task or endure hardship, with the underlying message that the completion of the task
      (even if difficult) is beneficial, but the act of forcing them through it is still an imposition.
      The use of 「弱い こと 言っ て ない で」 (Don't say weak things) reinforces the demanding tone.
  - english: I really want to show that rude customer what's what.
    japanese:
      - あの 失礼 な 客 に は、一 度 {思い知ら せ て やり たい}。
      - あの 失礼 な 客 に は、一 度 {思い知ら せ て やり たい です}。
    english_literally: For that rude customer, I want to make them realize (causing them trouble) once.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 失礼 な 客 に は、一 度 思い知ら せ たい。
        english: I want to make that rude customer realize once (neutral intent).
        hint: The simple desiderative states a wish to make someone realize something, but without the
          strong implication of actively imposing difficulty or consequences on them. We're looking for
          a desire to teach a harsh lesson.
    scene: A customer service representative is fed up with a consistently rude customer and wishes to
      teach them a lesson.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: desiderative (～たい)
    nuance: 「思い知ら せ て やり たい」 expresses a strong desire to make the rude customer understand the consequences
      of their actions, implying that the speaker wishes to inflict a negative experience upon them as
      a form of retribution or lesson. This carries a strong sense of justified anger.
  - english: Even if he tries to hide, I can find him and make him pay for what he did.
    japanese:
      - どこ に 隠れよう と、必ず 見つけ 出し て、報い を {受け させ て やれる}。
      - どこ に 隠れよう と、必ず 見つけ 出し て、報い を {受け させ て やれ ます}。
    english_literally: No matter where he tries to hide, I can certainly find him and make him receive
      his due (causing him trouble).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - どこ に 隠れよう と、必ず 見つけ 出し て、報い を 受け させ られる。
        english: Even if he tries to hide, I can find him and make him receive his due (neutral potential).
        hint: While 「受け させ られる」 indicates capability to make someone receive something, it lacks the assertive,
          almost vengeful intent of actively ensuring they suffer the consequences. We're looking for
          the ability to impose punishment.
    scene: A protagonist is pursuing an antagonist who has wronged them, vowing to deliver justice.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: potential (～られる/～える)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「受け させ て やれる」 strongly emphasizes the speaker's ability and determination to force
      the wrongdoer to face retribution. It signifies not just the capacity to act, but the active will
      to inflict the consequence, which aligns with the "causing trouble" nuance. This tone is often used
      in narratives by male characters seeking vengeance.
  - english: My boss keeps ignoring my proposals, so I'm subtly making his work harder behind the scenes.
    japanese:
      - 上司 が 私 の 提案 を 無視 し 続け て いる から、陰 で こっそり 仕事 を {やっ て やっ て いる} ん だ。
      - 上司 が 私 の 提案 を 無視 し 続け て いる から、陰 で こっそり 仕事 を {やっ て やっ て い ます} ん だ。
    english_literally: Because my boss keeps ignoring my proposals, I am secretly making his work harder
      (causing him trouble) behind the scenes.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 上司 が 私 の 提案 を 無視 し 続け て いる から、陰 で こっそり 仕事 を 難しく し て いる ん だ。
        english: My boss keeps ignoring my proposals, so I'm secretly making his work difficult behind
          the scenes.
        hint: 「難しく し て いる」 describes the act of making something difficult but doesn't convey the specific,
          active imposition of trouble as a consequence of frustration. We're looking for the active and
          continuous act of causing difficulty.
    scene: An employee, whose ideas are consistently overlooked, is taking subtle revenge on their superior.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    nuance: 「やっ て やっ て いる」 conveys the ongoing, deliberate act of making the boss's work difficult as
      a retaliatory measure for their ignorance. The progressive form highlights the continuous nature
      of this subtle act of defiance, emphasizing the speaker's sustained intent to cause inconvenience.
      The nuance could be interpreted as melancholic if the speaker feels resigned to such petty acts
      due to a lack of other options.
post_example_writeup: These examples illustrate the versatile applications of 「～てやる」, ranging from petty
  revenge to firm commands, always with the underlying nuance of causing trouble or inconvenience. Pay
  close attention to the context and speaker's intent, as this auxiliary verb adds a significant layer
  of meaning.
