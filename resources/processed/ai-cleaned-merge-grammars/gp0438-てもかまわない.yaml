    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てもかまわない」 is composed of 「～て」 form (connecting form of verbs), the particle 「も」 (even), and 「構わない」 (kamawanai), which is the negative form of the verb 「構う」 (kamau, to mind, to care about). Thus, it literally translates to \"even if [something happens], I don't mind.\"",
    "writeup": "「ても構わない」 is frequently employed to convey that something \"doesn't matter\" or that the speaker \"doesn't mind.\" This construction combines the 「～て」 form for verbs and い-adjectives, or 「でも」 for nouns and な-adjectives, with the negative conjugation of the う-verb 「構う」. The verb 「構う」 means \"to mind\" or \"to care about.\"\n\nLiterally, this expression can be understood as \"to not be bothered\" or \"to not be uptight.\" However, its practical usage almost always signifies that there is no issue or objection concerning a particular matter. The phrase 「ても構わない」 is versatile and can be applied to various word types once they are in their appropriate 「～て」 or 「でも」 form.\n\nHistorically, the kanji 構 (構う) often carries the nuance of \"to posture\" or \"to pose\" into a resistant or rigid stance. In the context of 「ても構わない」, this etymological root translates to the idea that a given situation will not cause the speaker to \"posture,\" \"position,\" or \"pose\" themselves in a resistant manner, thus indicating their acceptance or lack of concern.",

            "nuance": "「でよければ」 is used to offer something while humbly suggesting it might not be the best option, often implying a favor. In contrast, 「ても構わない」 simply states a lack of objection or personal indifference without necessarily offering anything or implying humility."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "「ても構わない」 conveys a strong personal stance from the speaker, indicating they have no objection to a specific matter, do not mind it, or do not consider it a problem. It emphasizes the speaker's personal lack of concern. In contrast, 「てもいい」 is primarily used to grant permission or to state that something is within an acceptable range, often from a more objective viewpoint. 「でよければ」 is used when humbly offering something, carrying the nuance of providing an option to the listener while suggesting it might be a compromise. It is crucial to differentiate between these expressions based on the speaker's intention and the specific context.",
