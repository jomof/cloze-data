    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てもかまわない」 combines 「ても」 (even if) with 「構わない」 (kamawanai), the negative form of 「構う」 (kamau), meaning 'to mind' or 'to care'. Therefore, 「ても構わない」 literally translates to 'even if..., I don't mind.'",
    "writeup": "「てもかまわない」 is often used to express that something 'doesn't matter' or that the speaker 'doesn't mind'. This structure combines 「ても」 (with verbs and い-adjectives) or 「でも」 (with nouns and な-adjectives) with the negative conjugation of the う-verb 「構う」, which means 'to brace' or 'to mind'. Literally, this expression can be understood as being similar to 'to not be uptight'. However, it is almost always simply used to convey that there is no issue with something.\n\n「ても構わない」 may be used with any type of word that appears in its 「ても」 or 「でも」 conjugated form.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「構う」 is usually translated as 'to brace', but the kanji 「構」 often has the nuance of 'to posture' or 'to pose' (into some type of strong/resistant shape). In the 「ても構わない」 grammar structure, this translates as (A) simply being something that will not cause the speaker to 'posture', 'position', or 'pose' themselves in a resistant way.",
