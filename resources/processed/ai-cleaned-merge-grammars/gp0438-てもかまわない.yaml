        "[Verb in て-form] + も + 構わない": "Expresses that the speaker doesn't mind or doesn't care if something happens.",
        "[Noun] + でも + 構わない": "Expresses that the speaker doesn't mind or doesn't care about a noun."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てもかまわない」 is composed of 「～て」 form (connecting form of verbs), the particle 「も」 (even), and 「構わない」 (kamawanai), which is the negative form of the verb 「構う」 (kamau, to mind, to care about). Thus, it literally translates to \"even if [something happens], I don't mind.\"",
    "writeup": "「ても構わない」 is often used to express that something \"doesn't matter,\" or that the speaker \"doesn't mind.\" This structure combines the 「～て」 form with verbs and い-adjectives, or 「でも」 with nouns and な-adjectives, grouped with the negative conjugation of the う-verb 「構う」, which means \"to mind, to care about.\"\n\nLiterally, this expression can be thought of as being similar to \"to not be uptight.\" However, it is almost always simply used to convey that there is no issue with something. 「ても構わない」 may be used with any type of word that appears in its 「～て」 or 「でも」 conjugation form.\n\n構う is usually translated as \"to brace,\" but the kanji 構 often has the nuance of \"to posture,\" or \"to pose\" (into some type of strong/resistant shape). In the 「ても構わない」 grammar structure, this translates as (A) simply being something that will not cause the speaker to \"posture\", \"position\", or \"pose\" themselves in a resistant way.",
