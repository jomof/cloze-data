formation:
  Verb[ます-stem] + おわる: Indicates the completion of the action described by the verb.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The grammar point combines the ます-stem of a verb, which represents the core action, with the
  verb おわる (終わる), meaning "to finish" or "to come to an end" (intransitive). This combination literally
  translates to "the action comes to an end," signifying the completion of the verb's action. The ます-stem
  serves as a connective form, linking the action to the auxiliary verb おわる, thus forming a compound verb
  that denotes finality.
writeup: |-
  The expression 「〜おわる」 is an auxiliary verb construction used to indicate that an action has been completed. It attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. While similar to simply stating that an action has concluded, 「〜おわる」 emphasizes the *completion* of the entire action or process. It suggests that the task or activity has been brought to a definitive close, leaving nothing further to be done regarding that specific action.

  This construction is commonly used when discussing tasks, studies, work, or any activity that has a clear beginning and end. It's often used in contrast to actions that are ongoing or partially finished. For instance, 「読みおわる」 means "to finish reading," implying the entire book or text has been read.

  「〜おわる」 can be used in various tenses and politeness levels, as the conjugation applies to the auxiliary verb おわる. For example, 「書きおわった」 (finished writing - plain past) or 「食べおわります」 (will finish eating - polite non-past).
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[てしまう] (completion・regret)
    meaning: to finish doing (with nuance of regret, completion, or suddenness)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both indicate completion, 「〜てしまう」 can carry additional nuances of regret, unexpectedness,
      or doing something completely/thoroughly. 「〜おわる」 is neutral, simply stating completion.
    grammar_point: Verb[てしまう・ちゃう・じゃう] (completion・regret)
  - term: Verb[終える] (to finish something - transitive)
    meaning: to finish something (transitive)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜おわる」 (終わる) is an *intransitive* verb, meaning the action finishes *by itself* or the subject
      completes the action. 「終える」 (おえる) is a *transitive* verb, meaning one *finishes something*. For
      example, 「仕事 が {終わった}」 (The work finished) vs. 「仕事 を {終えた}」 (I finished the work). When used as
      an auxiliary, 「〜おわる」 focuses on the completion of the *process* of the main verb, which is often
      an action performed by the subject. However, its core is tied to the intransitive "ending."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[終える] (to finish something)
  - term: Verb[切る] (do completely or thoroughly)
    meaning: to do something completely; to finish entirely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜切る」 emphasizes that an action has been done *completely* and *thoroughly*, often implying
      exhaustion or using everything up. 「〜おわる」 simply states the completion without this strong emphasis
      on thoroughness or exhaustive effort.
    grammar_point: 切る (do completely or thoroughly)
post_false_friends_writeup: It is important to distinguish 「〜おわる」 from other expressions of completion.
  While 「〜てしまう」 also signifies completion, it adds nuances such as regret or thoroughness, which are absent
  in the neutral 「〜おわる」. The transitive verb 「終える」(おえる) is used when the speaker directly completes an
  action on an object, whereas 「おわる」(おわる) as an auxiliary is about the *action itself* coming to an end.
  「〜切る」 implies a thorough or exhaustive completion, which is a stronger emphasis than just finishing
  an action.
