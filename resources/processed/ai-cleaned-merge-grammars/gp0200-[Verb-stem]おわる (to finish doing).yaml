formation:
  '[Verb stem] + おわる': Indicates the completion or ending of an action.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
etymology: The verb 「終わる (おわる)」 means "to end" or "to finish." When used as an auxiliary verb attached
  to the ます-stem of another verb, it signifies the completion of that specific action. This auxiliary
  usage stems directly from the core meaning of 「終わる」, implying that the action has reached its natural
  conclusion or end point.
writeup: |-
  To express that an action has been completed in Japanese, you can attach 「おわる (終わる)」 to the ます-stem of another verb. This grammatical structure, Verb-ますstem + おわる, indicates that the action denoted by the main verb has been brought to a close or finished.

  For example, 「読み終わる (yomiowaru)」 means "to finish reading," and 「書き終わる (kakiowaru)」 means "to finish writing." The focus is on the completion of the *action* itself, rather than simply stating that something has ended.

  Because 「おわる」 itself is a verb, it can be conjugated to express different tenses (e.g., past, non-past), forms (e.g., te-form, conditional), and registers (e.g., plain, polite). This allows for flexible expression of when an action was finished, will be finished, or is in the process of finishing.

  **Important Considerations**

  When choosing between 「おわる」 and its transitive counterpart 「終える (おえる)」, it is important to note that 「おわる」, when used as an auxiliary, is typically seen in an intransitive sense. This implies that the action "comes to an end" or "finishes" naturally. While 「終える」 (which means "to finish something" actively) can also be used as an auxiliary in some contexts, 「Verb-ますstem + おわる」 is generally used when the completion is viewed as an inherent process of the action itself, rather than something actively "finished" by an external agent. For example, rather than saying "I finished the homework" (emphasizing your agency), it implies "the homework-doing came to a finish."
false_friends:
  - term: はじめる
    meaning: To start, To begin to
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「~おわる」 which indicates the completion of an action, 「はじめる (to start doing)」 indicates
      the start of an action.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]はじめる (to start doing)'
  - term: だす
    meaning: To suddenly begin, To start doing
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「だす (to suddenly start doing)」 indicates starting something, often suddenly, whereas 「~おわる」
      means finishing something.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]だす (to suddenly start doing)'
  - term: 込む
    meaning: To do thoroughly, Deeply, Intensely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「込む (to do thoroughly)」 (as an auxiliary verb) implies a thoroughness or intensity in
      doing something, 「~おわる」 simply means to complete the action in a neutral way. For example, 読み込む
      (yomikomu - to read thoroughly) vs. 読み終わる (yomiowaru - to finish reading).
    grammar_point: 込む (to do thoroughly)
  - term: てしまう・ちゃう
    meaning: To do something by accident, To finish completely/totally, Unfortunately
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「てしまう・ちゃう (completion・regret・accident)」 also implies the completion of an action but often
      carries a nuance of regret, accidental completion, or absolute completion, unlike the neutral completion
      indicated by 「~おわる」.
    grammar_point: てしまう・ちゃう (completion・regret・accident)
  - term: 上がる 上げる
    meaning: Something is finished, To finish something, Something has come to an end, To do something
      completely, To do something through
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「上がる 上げる (to finish complete)」 can indicate completion, especially of a creative or constructive
      task, often with a sense of achievement or finality, whereas 「~おわる」 is a more general and neutral
      ending for an action.
    grammar_point: 上がる 上げる (to finish complete)
  - term: 切る
    meaning: To do something completely to the end, Utterly, Resolutely
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「切る (do completely or thoroughly)」 implies completing an action thoroughly, entirely, or with
      a decisive resolution, like cutting it off. 「~おわる」 is a more neutral indication that an action has
      simply come to an end.
    grammar_point: 切る (do completely or thoroughly)
  - term: 済む
    meaning: To be sufficient, to get by
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「済む (to be sufficient・to get by)」 indicates that something has concluded or is complete, often
      focusing on the resolution of a matter or a passive state (e.g., the work is done), whereas 「~おわる」
      emphasizes the active completion of a specific action.
    grammar_point: 済む (to be sufficient・to get by)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「~おわる」 with similar expressions, remember that 「~おわる」 specifically
  denotes the simple completion or ending of an action itself. While other expressions might share the
  idea of completion, they often carry additional nuances like regret, intensity, elevation, or resolution.
  Focus on whether you simply want to state that an action has finished, or if you want to add extra meaning
  to the completion, such as how it was finished (thoroughly, regrettably) or what type of task it was.

  way to express the completion of a specific action. While there are other expressions for completion
  in Japanese, this construction is versatile and generally neutral, making it a fundamental tool in expressing
  finished actions. It is particularly useful for focusing on the cessation of the process itself, rather
  than the state of something being merely 'done' or the agent's active 'finishing' of it.
