formation:
  Verb (dictionary form) + ところだ: Indicates an action is about to happen or is on the verge of happening.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: general
  function: Expresses the immediate imminence of an action or event.
  nuance: Emphasizes that an action is at the very point of commencing. It conveys a sense of being right
    at the threshold of something happening.
etymology: 「ところ」 comes from the verb 「とまる」 (to stop), and originally referred to a place where one stops
  or resides. Over time, its meaning expanded to include situations, stages, and moments in time. In this
  grammar point, 「ところ」 refers to a specific point in the progression of an action, specifically, the point
  immediately before it begins.
writeup: The noun 「ところ」 (sometimes shortened to 「とこ」) is often used to describe the "place" or "situation"
  in which something happens. The primary determining factor for the nuance of 「ところ」 is the tense of the
  verb it follows. When used with a verb in its dictionary (non-past) form, as in 「Vる + ところだ」, it expresses
  that an action is "about to" or "on the verge of" happening. While 「ところ」 itself can refer to a physical
  location, in this grammatical construction, it denotes a specific **moment**, **state**, **stage**,
  or **level** in the progression of an action. For instance, 「今から出かけるところだ」 means "I am about to go out
  now," indicating the precise moment just before leaving. When the kanji form of 「所」 is used, it often
  refers to an actual physical location rather than a situation or standpoint. However, even with the
  kanji, in contexts like this grammar point, it can still convey the sense of a "point in time" or "situation."
  Both the kanji form and the hiragana form (「ところ」) are relatively common in this usage.

  - term: Vるところだった
    meaning: Almost did, nearly did, was about to (but didn't)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「Vるところだ」 means an action is about to happen, 「Vるところだった」 indicates that an action *almost*
      happened but ultimately did not, or it was on the verge of happening but was interrupted. It implies
      a near-miss or a thwarted event.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ところだった (was just about to)'
  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]+とする
    meaning: Try to, attempt to, to be about to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Verb[volitional-よう]とする」 implies an *intention* or *effort* to do something, often with the
      nuance of attempting. In contrast, 「Vるところだ」 simply states that something is on the verge of happening,
      without necessarily emphasizing the actor's intent or effort.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-volitional]とする・としない (to try to・to not try to)'
  - term: Vかけ
    meaning: Half-finished, in the middle of, not yet complete
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Vかけ」 indicates that an action has begun but is not yet finished. 「Vるところだ」, however, focuses
      on the moment *before* the action even starts, emphasizing its imminent beginning.
    grammar_point: かけ (incomplete or on the verge)
  - term: Vたところだ
    meaning: Just finished doing, just did
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「Vたところだ」 means that an action has just been completed very recently. This is distinct from
      「Vるところだ」, which means the action is about to begin. The verb tense preceding 「ところだ」 is crucial for
      differentiating these meanings.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-た]ところだ (just finished doing)'
  - term: Vているところだ
    meaning: In the middle of doing, currently doing
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「Vているところだ」 means that an action is currently in progress. This contrasts with 「Vるところだ」, which
      signifies an action that is about to start. The progressive aspect 「ている」 is the key differentiator.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]いるところだ (in the process of doing)'
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「Vるところだ」 with similar expressions, pay close attention
  to the verb form preceding 「ところだ」. The dictionary form (Vる) signifies 'about to', the -ta form (Vた)
  signifies 'just finished', and the -te iru form (Vている) signifies 'in the middle of'. Additionally, other
  expressions like 「Vるところだった」 (almost did) or 「V[volitional]とする」 (intend to do) have different nuances
  of completion, intention, or near-miss, which are important to grasp for precise communication.

        english: I am going to eat a meal now.
        hint: 「～に行く」 means 'to go to do something'. While it implies an upcoming action, it focuses on
          the movement towards doing it, not the absolute imminence of the action itself.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 今 ご飯 を {食べ た ところ だ}。

          - 私 は 今 から {もう すぐ} ご飯 を 食べ ます。
        english: I will eat a meal very soon from now.
        hint: 「もうすぐ」 means "very soon," indicating an will happen in the near future. 「Vるところだ」 specifically

    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「今から」 emphasizes the immediacy of the action, and the casual 「だ」 is typical for
      informal conversations. The speaker's use of 「私」 combined with the casual ending suggests a direct
      and personal response to a close male acquaintance.

          - 会議 は １０ 分 後 に {始まり ます}。
        english: The meeting will start in 10 minutes.
        hint: While '始まります' means 'will start', '始まるところです' specifically highlights that it's on the very
          verge of starting, emphasizing the immediate proximity of the event, which is useful information
          for a client.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 は １０ 分 後 に {始まる 予定 です}。
        english: The meeting is scheduled to start in 10 minutes.
        hint: 「予定です」 indicates that something is planned or scheduled. This focuses on the fixed schedule
          rather than the action being on the absolute verge of beginning.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 は １０ 分 後 に {始まり そう です}。
        english: It looks like the meeting will start in 10 minutes.
        hint: 「～そうです」 indicates that something appears to be happening or likely to happen based on observation.
          This conveys a prediction, not a statement of immediate imminence.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 は 今 {始まっ た ところ です}。
        english: The meeting just started right now.

      to an older male client.
  - english: It's not the time to be playing now.
    japanese:

      - 今 は {遊ぶ ところ じゃ ない} よ。
      - 今 は {遊ぶ ところ で は あり ませ ん} よ。
      - 今 は {遊ぶ とこ じゃ ねえ} よ。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今 は {遊ん で は いけ ない} よ。
        english: You must not play now.
        hint: While '遊んでは いけない' means 'must not play' and indicates a prohibition, '遊ぶところではない' emphasizes
          that the current *situation* or *moment* is inappropriate for playing, rather than a strict
          prohibition. This often conveys a softer, yet firm, message of unsuitability.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今 は {遊ぶ べき で は ない} よ。
        english: You shouldn't play now.
        hint: 「～べきではない」 expresses moral obligation or strong advisability. This suggests that playing
          is morally wrong or highly inappropriate, whereas '遊ぶところではない' simply states it's the wrong moment.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今 は {遊ぶ 場合 じゃ ない} よ。
        english: It's not the situation for playing now.
        hint: 「場合じゃない」 is very similar to 'ところではない' but 'ところではない' specifically emphasizes that the *point*
          or *moment* is unsuitable, whereas '場合じゃない' focuses on the general *circumstance*.
    scene: A father scolding his son who is trying to play during study time.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「よ」 at the end softens the command slightly while emphasizing the speaker's advice.
      The negative form 「ではない」 indicates the unsuitability of the action at this specific 'point' or 'situation'.
      An older male speaking to a younger male (his son) will typically use casual forms like 「ところではない」
      and the sentence-ending particle 「よ」.

      - 彼、転び そう に なっ た けど、ギリギリ で {倒れる とこ だっ た}。

          - 彼 は 転び そう に なっ た が、ギリギリ で {倒れ そう に なっ た}。
        english: He almost fell, but managed to avoid looking like he would collapse at the last second.
        hint: While '倒れそうになった' means 'looked like he would collapse' or 'became likely to collapse', '倒れるところだった'
          specifically conveys that he was *on the verge* of collapsing and narrowly avoided it, emphasizing
          the extremely close call and the actual imminence of the event, which did not occur.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 転び そう に なっ た が、ギリギリ で {倒れ かけ た}。
        english: He began to collapse (and stopped).
        hint: 「～かける」 means to begin an action, or to be on the verge of doing something, often with the
          implication of it being incomplete or interrupted. '倒れかけた' suggests the action of falling started,
          while '倒れるところだった' means the fall was about to start but didn't.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 転び そう に なっ た が、ギリギリ で {倒れ そう だっ た}。
        english: He almost fell, but barely seemed like he would collapse.
        hint: 「～そうだった」 expresses that it appeared to be the case. While it conveys a similar sense of
          near-occurrence, '倒れるところだった' is more definitive about the action being at the very brink, rather
          than just an appearance.
    scene: Two friends discussing an incident where someone nearly had an accident.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The past tense 「だった」 here implies that the action (falling) was on the verge of happening
      but ultimately did not, highlighting a near-miss. 「ギリギリ」 emphasizes the narrowness of the escape.
      The casual male speech combined with the shared experience of the conversation makes this suitable
      between younger friends.
  - english: She was just about to arrive at her hotel room when she realized she had forgotten her key.

        english: She was trying to arrive at her hotel room when she realized she had forgotten her key.
        hint: While '着こう とした 時 に' (when she tried to arrive) also implies an imminent action, '着くところだった'
          precisely captures the moment of being *right at the point* of arrival, which was then immediately
          interrupted by the realization, emphasizing the immediate state of being on the verge. The former
          focuses on intention, the latter on imminence.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 が ホテル の 部屋 に {着き かけ た 時 に}、鍵 を 忘れ た こと に 気づい た。
        english: She began to arrive at her hotel room when she realized she had forgotten her key.
        hint: 「着きかけた」 implies that the action of arriving has already begun, even if it was incomplete.
          '着くところだった' specifically refers to the moment *before* the action begins, emphasizing the threshold.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 が ホテル の 部屋 に {着く 直前 に}、鍵 を 忘れ た こと に 気づい た。
        english: Just before arriving at her hotel room, she realized she had forgotten her key.
        hint: 「直前」 (just before) also indicates immediate timing, but 'ところだった' adds the nuance of being
          in that specific 'stage' or 'situation' of imminence, often implying a thwarted action or near
          miss, which '直前' does not inherently carry.
    scene: A friend recounting a travel mishap to another friend.
    register: formal
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The construction 「Vるところだったのに」 expresses a sense of being on the verge of doing something,
      followed by an unexpected turn of events (indicated by 「のに」). This implies a thwarted intention
      or a near-miss. An older female speaker might choose slightly more formal language like 「着くところだった」
      when recounting a story to a group, conveying a sense of shared experience with a narrative flair.
  - english: The pasta is about to be perfectly al dente.

          - パスタ は ちょうど よく アルデンテ に {なり ます}。
        english: The pasta will become perfectly al dente.
        hint: 「なります」 simply states a future change. 「なる ところ です」 specifically highlights that it's on the
          very verge of reaching that state, emphasizing the immediate imminence.
      - competing_japanese:
          - パスタ は {もう すぐ} アルデンテ です。
        english: The pasta is al dente soon.
        hint: 「もうすぐ」 indicates 'soon' or 'shortly'. While similar, 「なる ところ です」 provides a more precise
          sense of being at the exact threshold of achieving the al dente state, indicating readiness.
    scene: A chef explains the cooking progress to a restaurant guest.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male

    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The professional setting and the older male chef's usage of 「なる ところ です」 imply precision and
      expertise, assuring the customers that the dish is reaching its optimal state. The politeness of
      「です」 is appropriate for addressing patrons.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 電車 が {もう すぐ} ５ 番線 に 来 ます。
        english: The train will come to platform 5 soon.
        hint: 「もうすぐ」 indicates 'soon'. 「着く ところ だ」 conveys a stronger sense of being on the very verge
          of pulling in, implying a more precise and immediate moment than just 'soon'.
    scene: A friend at the station points out the arriving train to another friend.

          - 今、その こと を {話し て は いけ ませ ん}。
        english: You must not talk about that now.
        hint: 「～て は いけ ませ ん」 expresses a strict prohibition. 「話す ところ で は あり ませ ん」 is softer, indicating
          that the current *situation* or *moment* is simply inappropriate for the action, rather than
          forbidding it outright.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今、その こと を {話す べき で は あり ませ ん}。
        english: You should not talk about that now.
        hint: 「～べき で は あり ませ ん」 implies a moral or strong advisability against an action. 「話す ところ で は
          あり ませ ん」 focuses on the impropriety of the action *at this specific time or context*, without
          necessarily implying a moral judgment.
    scene: A serious business meeting where one participant brings up an irrelevant topic.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The formal negative 「で は あり ませ ん」 clearly conveys an emphatic denial of the suitability of
      the action at this specific moment or context. An older male in a business setting would use this
      strong but polite phrasing to redirect the conversation.

        hint: 「～よう と し た 時 に」 implies an intention or attempt to do something. 「出る ところ だっ た」 precisely
          captures the moment of being *right at the point* of leaving, which was then immediately interrupted,
          emphasizing the imminence rather than the intention.

          - 家 を {出る 直前 に}、財布 を 忘れ た こと を 思い出し た。
        english: Just before leaving the house, I remembered I forgot my wallet.
        hint: 「直前」 (just before) indicates immediate timing. However, 「出る ところ だっ た」 adds the nuance of
          being in that specific 'stage' or 'situation' of imminence, often implying a thwarted action
          or near miss, which 「直前」 does not inherently carry.
    scene: Someone recounts a minor daily mishap to a family member.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The casual 「だった」 with 「のに」 expresses a mild frustration or a "missed opportunity" because
      of the forgotten wallet. This common occurrence makes the casual register suitable for a family
      conversation.
  - english: Oh, be careful! You were about to step on a banana peel.
    japanese:
      - あ、危ない！バナナ の 皮 を {踏む ところ でし た} よ。
      - あ、危ない！バナナ の 皮 を {踏む ところ だっ た} よ。
      - あ、危ない！バナナ の 皮 を {踏む ところ でし た}。
      - あ、危ない！バナナ の 皮 {踏む とこ だっ た} よ。
      - あ、危ない！バナナ の 皮 {踏む とこ でし た} よ。
    english_literally: Oh, dangerous! Banana's peel, was about to step on, you know.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あ、危ない！バナナ の 皮 を {踏む ところ だっ た} よ。
        english: Oh, be careful! You were about to step on a banana peel.
        hint: Both convey the same meaning. This version uses the polite past tense 「でした」, which can add
          a touch more concern or formality compared to the plain past tense 「だった」.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あ、危ない！バナナ の 皮 を {踏み そう に なっ た} よ。
        english: Oh, be careful! It looked like you would step on a banana peel.
        hint: 「～そう に なっ た」 means 'it looked like it would happen' or 'came to seem like it would happen'.
          While similar, 「踏む ところ でし た」 is more direct about the action being at the very brink of occurring,
          emphasizing the near miss more strongly.
    scene: A person warns their friend who almost steps on something.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: cautious
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「でした」 adds a touch of polite concern, fitting for someone giving a warning. The
      「よ」 softens the warning, making it sound more like a friendly heads-up. The male speaker uses a
      slightly more polite form than completely casual, showing consideration.
  - english: The cherry blossoms are about to bloom.
    japanese:
      - 桜 が {咲く ところ だ}。
      - 桜 が {咲く ところ です}。
      - 桜 が {咲く ところ だ} よ。
      - 桜 が {咲く ところ だ} ね。
      - 桜 {咲く とこ だ}。
    english_literally: Cherry blossoms, are about to bloom.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 桜 が {咲き ます}。
        english: The cherry blossoms will bloom.
        hint: 「咲きます」 is a general statement about a future event. 「咲く ところ だ」 highlights the immediate
          imminence, suggesting the blooming is right at hand and one can almost see it happening.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 桜 が {もう すぐ} 咲き ます。
        english: The cherry blossoms will bloom soon.
        hint: 「もうすぐ」 indicates 'soon'. 「咲く ところ だ」 conveys a stronger sense of being on the very verge
          of blooming, implying a more precise and immediate moment than just 'soon'.
    scene: Two friends enjoying a walk in a park during early spring.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This sentence simply states an imminent natural event, indicating observation rather than
      an action. The simple 「だ」 is natural in casual conversation between friends. An older female might
      use this simple observation when admiring nature with a friend.
  - english: It looks like it's about to rain.
    japanese:
      - 雨 が {降る ところ だ}。
      - 雨 が {降る ところ です}。
      - 雨 が {降る とこ だ}。
      - 今 に も 雨 が {降る ところ だ}。
    english_literally: Rain is about to fall.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 が {降り そう だ}。
        english: It looks like it will rain.
        hint: 「～そうだ」 conveys an appearance or prediction based on observation. 「降るところだ」 emphasizes the
          extreme imminence of the rain, indicating it is right at the point of starting.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 が {降る だろう}。
        english: It will probably rain.
        hint: 「～だろう」 indicates conjecture or probability. 「降るところだ」 states that the action is on the verge
          of happening, rather than simply being probable.
    scene: Looking out the window at dark clouds gathering.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「雨が降るところだ」 emphasizes the immediate onset of rain, suggesting one should quickly
      prepare, like grabbing an umbrella. This is a common, casual observation.
post_example_writeup: The grammar point 「Vたところだ」 means "just finished doing," and 「Vているところだ」 means "in
  the middle of doing." It is crucial to distinguish these forms from 「Vるところだ」, which specifically denotes
  an action that is "about to" happen. The form of the preceding verb (dictionary, -te iru, or -ta) is
  key to the meaning.
