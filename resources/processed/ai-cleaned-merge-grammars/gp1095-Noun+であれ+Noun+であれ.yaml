        "counterpoint": "Similar expressions include 「であろうと〜であろうと」, 「でも〜でも」, and 「と言わず〜と言わず」. While this grammar point doesn't have a direct antonym, constructions that specify conditions or limitations could be used as a contrast."

    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Noun+であれ+Noun+であれ」 is used to express that something is true or applicable regardless of which option is chosen from a pair of nouns or *na*-adjectives. It translates to \"whether X or Y\" or \"be it X or Y.\" It's generally employed in formal writing and speech.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n*   It presents two options, suggesting the outcome is the same for both.\n*   It can connect two nouns or two *na*-adjectives, or even a series of three or more, though two is most common.\n*   It is predominantly found in formal contexts, lending a sense of universality and gravitas to the statement.",

            "nuance": "「であろうと〜であろうと」 often expresses stronger hypothetical situations or conditions than 「であれ〜であれ」. It also tends to be used with verbs or predicative adjectives that describe actions or states that might occur, rather than simply presenting two nouns or na-adjectives as options."

            "nuance": "「と言わず〜と言わず」 emphasizes a range or totality, often implying that something applies comprehensively throughout a given scope (e.g., 'morning and night,' 'hands and feet'). In contrast, 「であれ〜であれ」 focuses on two distinct, specific options, suggesting the statement holds true for either."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「であろうと〜であろうと」, 「でも〜でも」, and 「と言わず〜と言わず」 share the function of presenting alternatives or ranges, they differ significantly in formality and nuance. Use 「であれ〜であれ」 in formal settings when presenting two distinct options where the outcome remains the same. 「であろうと〜であろうと」 works for more hypothetical verbal situations, 「でも〜でも」 for casual options, and 「と言わず〜と言わず」 for emphasizing a comprehensive range rather than two distinct choices. Selecting the correct expression improves the clarity and appropriateness of your communication.",

            "nuance": "The phrase 「生魚 が 大好き だ」 expresses a strong liking for raw fish. The use of 「であれ」 linking 「寿司」と「刺身」 emphasizes that his love for raw fish is so strong it encompasses both categories without distinction, highlighting a definitive preference. Although the sentence ends informally with 「だ」, the use of 「であれ」 elevates the expression to a semi-formal level, adding emphasis suitable for a strong declaration.",
            "etymology": "The word 「寿司」 (sushi) originates from the concept of fermented fish and rice, evolving over centuries from a preservation method to the culinary art we know today. 「刺身」 (sashimi) literally means 'pierced body' and refers to thinly sliced raw fish, a traditional Japanese delicacy."

            "etymology": "「過去」 (kako) and 「未来」 (mirai) are philosophical concepts central to discussions of time. 「過去」 refers to what has passed, while 「未来」 indicates what is yet to come, both essential for articulating a temporal scope in profound statements."
