        "part-of-speech": "prefix",

    "etymology": "「毎」 (mai) itself means \"every\" or \"each\". It is used to quantify or express repetition within a specific time frame or event.",
    "writeup": "「毎」 (mai) is a prefix attached to nouns that represent units of time. It expresses the meaning of \"every\" or \"per\". For example, 「毎日」 (mainichi) means \"every day,\" and 「毎月」 (maitsuki) means \"every month\".\n\nIt's essential to remember that 「毎」 can only be used with nouns related to time or concepts closely linked to time. For example, you can say 「毎食」 (maishoku) - every meal - because meals are associated with time.\n\nIt cannot be used with nouns like 「人」 (hito, person) to mean 'every person'; instead, expressions like 「すべての人」 (subete no hito) or 「みんな」 (minna) are used. Similarly, 「毎先生」 (mai sensei, every teacher) or 「毎家」 (mai ie, every house) are incorrect.",

In contrast, 「ごとに」 is a suffix that attaches to nouns (often time-related) or dictionary forms of verbs. It emphasizes each individual instance or interval within a series, highlighting distinct, discrete occurrences rather than a continuous flow. For example, 「三時間ごとに」 (sanjikan-goto ni) means 'every three hours,' focusing on each individual three-hour block, whereas 「毎時間」 (maijikan) means 'every hour,' implying a continuous hourly rhythm."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「毎」 and 「ごとに」 can express concepts of repetition, their nuances differ subtly. 「毎」 suggests a more generalized, continuous, or habitual recurrence, often forming a single, common compound word. 「ごとに」, however, isolates and emphasizes each instance or interval. Think of 「毎」 as 'daily' in a routine sense, and 「ごとに」 as 'each day' highlighting individual days. For example, 「毎朝ジョギングする」 (maiasa jogingu suru) implies a habitual morning jog. 「五分ごとに水を飲む」 (gofun-goto ni mizu o nomu) would mean drinking water every five minutes, emphasizing distinct five-minute intervals. The choice between them often depends on whether you want to convey a continuous, general pattern or highlight individual, discrete occurrences.",
