            "nuance": "「毎」 is a prefix that combines with a noun to form a single lexical unit, often implying a regular, continuous occurrence or schedule (e.g., 毎日 'every day'). In contrast, 「ごとに」 is a suffix that attaches to nouns (often time-related) or dictionary forms of verbs. It emphasizes each individual instance or interval within a series, highlighting distinct, discrete occurrences rather than a continuous flow. For example, 「３時間ごとに」 (sanjikan-goto ni) means 'every three hours' focusing on each individual three-hour block, whereas 「毎時間」 (maijikan) means 'every hour' implying a continuous hourly rhythm."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「毎」 and 「ごとに」 can express concepts of repetition, their nuances differ subtly. 「毎」 suggests a more generalized, continuous, or habitual recurrence, often forming a single, common compound word. 「ごとに」, however, isolates and emphasizes each instance or interval. Think of 「毎」 as 'daily' in a routine sense, and 「ごとに」 as 'each day' highlighting individual days. For example, 「毎朝ジョギングする」 (maiasa jogingu suru) implies a habitual morning jog. 「毎朝５分ごとに水を飲む」 (maiasa gofun-goto ni mizu o nomu) would mean drinking water every five minutes *within* the morning, emphasizing distinct five-minute intervals. The choice between them often depends on whether you want to convey a continuous, general pattern or highlight individual, discrete occurrences.",

        "violation: Added 'false_friends' entry for 'ごとに' and a 'post_false_friends_writeup'. The input DOJG data explicitly listed 'ごとに' as a related expression, and rule 14 implies adding false friends when present and relevant. This was missing in the prior grammar point."
