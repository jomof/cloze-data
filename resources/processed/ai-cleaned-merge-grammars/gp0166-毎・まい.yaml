        "Usage": "Used as a prefix to nouns indicating units of time to express 'every' or 'per'.",
        "Limitations": "Can only be attached to nouns that express a unit of time or a concept closely associated with time (e.g., meals)."
    },
    "etymology": "「毎」 (mai) itself means \"every\" or \"each\". It is used to quantify or express repetition within a specific time frame or event.",
    "writeup": "「毎」 (mai) is a prefix attached to nouns that represent units of time. It expresses the meaning of \"every\" or \"per\". For example, 「毎日」 (mainichi) means \"every day,\" and 「毎月」 (maitsuki) means \"every month.\" It's essential to remember that 「毎」 can only be used with nouns related to time or concepts closely linked to time. For example, you can say 「毎食」 (maishoku) - every meal - because meals are associated with time. It cannot be used with nouns like 「人」 (hito, person) to mean 'every person'; instead, expressions like 「すべての人」 (subete no hito) or 「みんな」 (minna) are used. Similarly, 「毎先生」 (mai sensei, every teacher) or 「毎家」 (mai ie, every house) are incorrect.",

It emphasizes each individual instance or interval within a series, highlighting distinct, discrete occurrences rather than a continuous flow.

Think of 「毎」 as 'daily' in a routine sense, and 「ごとに」 as 'each day' highlighting individual days. For example, 「毎朝ジョギングする」 (maiasa jogingu suru) implies a habitual morning jog. 「５分ごとに水を飲む」 (gofun-goto ni mizu o nomu) would mean drinking water every five minutes, emphasizing distinct five-minute intervals.
