    "writeup": "「毎」 (まい) is a prefix meaning \"every,\" \"each,\" or \"per.\" It attaches to nouns, primarily those indicating units of time or frequency, to express that something happens in each of those time units. For example, 毎日 (まいにち) means \"every day,\" 毎月 (まいつき) means \"every month,\" and 毎年 (まいとし) means \"every year.\"\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   Not all nouns can be directly preceded by 毎. It is generally used with units of time or occurrences like meal times.\n*   Incorrect: 毎人 (まいにん) (every person), correct: 毎日 (まいにち) (every day).\n*   Incorrect: 毎先生 (まいせんせい) (every teacher), correct: 毎時間 (まいじかん) (every hour).\n*   Incorrect: 毎家 (まいいえ) (every house), correct: 毎晩 (まいばん) (every night).",
