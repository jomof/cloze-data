        "nuance": "The combination of に and は adds emphasis and often implies a necessary condition or a specific perspective regarding the preceding noun or verb phrase. While に alone can indicate purpose, adding は highlights this purpose as a topic or creates a contrast, suggesting 'as for this purpose/thing, then...'.",
        "source": "Bunpro, DOJG",

    "etymology": "The particle 「には」 is a combination of the particle 「に」, which indicates purpose, direction, or a target, and the particle 「は」, which marks the topic or creates a contrast. Historically, both particles have maintained their core functions, and their combination allows for a nuanced expression of a specific focus or condition related to the preceding element. The emphasis of 「は」 makes the target of 「に」 stand out.",
    "writeup": "「には」 is a widely used particle combination in Japanese that serves to express purpose, condition, or to highlight a specific target or topic. It is formed by attaching the topic/contrast marker 「は」 to the particle 「に」. The base particle 「に」 indicates a direction, purpose, or a specific point in time or space. When 「は」 is appended, it elevates the preceding element (be it a verb in dictionary form or a noun) to the status of a topic, drawing particular attention to it and often implying a contrast or a specific condition.\n\nCommonly translated as \"in order to,\" \"in regard to,\" or simply \"for,\" 「には」 can be understood as setting up a specific premise or requirement for what follows. For example, when used with a verb in dictionary form, it specifies the purpose for which an action is undertaken. When used with a noun, it can indicate suitability, a target audience, or a specific perspective, often with an underlying sense of contrast ('for X, but perhaps not for Y').\n\nWhile 「には」 shares semantic overlap with other expressions like 「ために」 or 「にとって」, its distinctive feature lies in the emphatic nature contributed by 「は」. This emphasis means that whatever is stated after 「には」 is specifically true or applicable to the element preceding it, often implying that it might not be true for others. This makes 「には」 particularly useful when discussing prerequisites, necessities, or evaluations specific to a given subject.",

When used for purpose, 「のに」 often implies a means to an end, whereas 「には」 implies a necessary condition or prerequisite."
