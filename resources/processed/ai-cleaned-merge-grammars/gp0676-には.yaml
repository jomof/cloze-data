    "etymology": "The particle 「には」 is a combination of the particle 「に」, indicating purpose or direction, and the particle 「は」, indicating topic or contrast. The 「に」 particle marks the preceding word or phrase as a target or goal, while 「は」 highlights that what follows is specific to that target or goal. Etymologically, this combination emphasizes a specific focus or condition related to the topic.",
    "writeup": "「には」 is a common particle combination used to express purpose, condition, or contrast. It combines 「に」, indicating a target or goal, with 「は」, marking the topic or contrast. It can be translated as \"in order to,\" \"in regard to,\" or \"for,\" and is used after verbs in dictionary form or nouns. While it has different translations, it can generally be thought of as meaning \"for\", where 「に」 highlights the target and 「は」 emphasizes that the following information is specific to that target.",
