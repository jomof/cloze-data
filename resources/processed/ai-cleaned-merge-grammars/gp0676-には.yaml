    "writeup": "「には」 is a common particle combination used to express purpose, condition, or contrast. It combines 「に」, indicating a target or goal, with 「は」, marking the topic or contrast. It can be translated as \"in order to,\" \"in regard to,\" or \"for,\" and is used after verbs in dictionary form or nouns. While it has different translations, it can generally be thought of as meaning \"for\", where 「に」 highlights the target and 「は」 emphasizes that the following information is specific to that target.",
