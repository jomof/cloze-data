    "etymology": "The structure combines 「に」, a particle indicating cause or reason, with the imperative forms 「せよ」 and 「しろ」 of the verb 「する」 (to do). The imperative form, in this context, adds a sense of concession or acceptance, like saying \"let's say it is so,\" before presenting the main point.",
    "writeup": "「にせよ」 and 「にしろ」 are phrases often translated as \"even if (A)\" or \"no matter if (A).\" The structure combines 「に」 with the imperative forms 「せよ」 or 「しろ」 of 「する」. 「せよ」 is more common in written material, while 「しろ」 is more common in speech.\n\nDespite the English translations, the imperative form of 「する」 translates more accurately to \"so it's (A), who cares!\" The speaker is strongly stating that the actual condition of (A) is unimportant in relation to what they want to say.\n\n「にせよ」 and 「にしろ」 can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns in any form.\n\nThis structure emphasizes that regardless of the case for (A), (B) is still true or the more important matter to consider.",
