    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「に」 (a particle indicating reason or cause) + 「せよ」 or 「しろ」, which are imperative forms of the verb 「する」 (to do). Essentially, it's like saying \"even if it *were* the case that...\"",
    "writeup": "The phrases 「にせよ」 and 「にしろ」 both convey the meaning of \"even if (A),\" or \"no matter if (A).\" The structure combines the particle 「に」 with either 「せよ」 or 「しろ」, which are imperative forms of the verb 「する」 (to do). 「せよ」 is more common in written language, while 「しろ」 is more frequently used in speech.\n\nDespite the English translations, this use of the imperative form implies something along the lines of \"so it's (A), who cares!\" The speaker emphasizes that the condition of (A) is unimportant relative to what they want to say. 「にせよ」 and 「にしろ」 can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns in various forms.\n\nThis structure is typically used to emphasize that regardless of (A), (B) remains true or is more important to consider. Often used in situations to express a strong concession, meaning that despite whatever precedes 「にせよ」 or 「にしろ」, it does not change the outcome or the main point the speaker wants to make.",
