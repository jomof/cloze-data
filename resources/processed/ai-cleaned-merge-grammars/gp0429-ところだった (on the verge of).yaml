    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ところだった」 expresses that something was very close to happening, but ultimately did not. It conveys a sense of relief, regret, or surprise that the event was narrowly avoided. It's like saying \"I was just about to...\" or \"I almost...\".\n\nWhen used with a verb in the dictionary form (e.g., 食べるところだった), it means you were about to do something.\nWhen used with a verb in the negative form (e.g., 食べないところだった), it means you were about *not* to do something, but circumstances changed.",
