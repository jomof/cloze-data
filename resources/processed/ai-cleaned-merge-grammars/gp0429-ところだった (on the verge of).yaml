    "etymology": "「ところ」 is a noun meaning \"place\" or \"situation.\" In this grammar point, it refers to the situation immediately preceding an event. 「だった」 is the past form of the copula 「だ」, indicating that the event nearly occurred but ultimately did not.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ところだった」 expresses that something was very close to happening, but ultimately did not. It conveys a sense of relief, regret, or surprise that the event was narrowly avoided. It's like saying \"I was just about to...\" or \"I almost...\".\n\n*   When used with a verb in the dictionary form (e.g., 食べるところだった), it means you were about to do something.\n*   When used with a verb in the negative form (e.g., 食べないところだった), it means you were about *not* to do something, but circumstances changed.",
