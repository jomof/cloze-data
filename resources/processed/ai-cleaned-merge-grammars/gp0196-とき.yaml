        "function": "Temporal indicator, linking an action or state to a specific time or period.",

    },
    "etymology": "The word 「時 (とき)」 directly translates to \"time\" in Japanese. Its usage as a temporal conjunction evolved from its core meaning, allowing it to specify the exact moment or period during which an action or state takes place. It acts as a pivot, connecting a preceding clause that describes the condition or event (what is happening or was happening) with a following clause that describes what occurs at that time.",
    "writeup": "「とき」 (時 in kanji) functions as a dependent noun meaning \"when\" or \"at the time of.\" It is used to describe actions or states that occur at specific times or during certain events. 「とき」 is notably versatile, applicable to both recurring events (habits, routines) and unique, single occurrences. For example, 「雨が降る**とき**」 (when it rains) describes a general condition, while 「あの映画を見た**とき**」 (when I watched that movie) refers to a specific past event.\n\nTo use 「とき」, you attach it to the end of a clause. The form of the word preceding 「とき」 depends on its part of speech:\n*   **Verbs**: Attach directly to the plain form (dictionary form, ta-form, or te-iru form). For instance, 「食べる**とき**」 (when eating) or 「食べた**とき**」 (when I ate).\n*   **い-adjectives**: Attach directly to the adjective. For example, 「寒い**とき**」 (when it's cold).\n*   **な-adjectives**: Add 「な」 before 「とき」. For example, 「静かな**とき**」 (when it's quiet).\n*   **Nouns**: Add 「の」 before 「とき」. For example, 「学生の**とき**」 (when I was a student).\n\nThe particle 「に」 can optionally follow 「とき」, especially when the following clause describes a single, specific action occurring at that time. For instance, 「駅に着く**とき**に電話してください。」 (Please call me when you arrive at the station.) While 「に」 is optional, its inclusion often emphasizes the specific moment of occurrence.",

However, this phrasing carries a slightly more feminine tone when used to express a general, soft observation like this. A male speaker might use just 「〜なる」 or 「〜なるよ」 but 「〜なるね」 can also be used by men in intimate or very casual contexts. "
