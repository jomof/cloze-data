    "writeup": "The grammar point 「がある+Noun」 functions to describe a noun by indicating that it possesses or is associated with another noun. The structure is '(A) がある (B)' = '(B) has/with (A)'. This creates a relative clause, which acts like an adjective, modifying the noun that follows 「がある」. In English, we might use pronouns like \"who,\" \"which,\" or \"that\" to introduce such clauses, but Japanese omits these, directly connecting 「がある」 to the noun it modifies.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   In this structure, (B) is considered the main topic/subject, so 「は」 is generally not used in place of 「が」. However, 「の」 can be used instead of 「が」 to show the relationship between (A) and (B).",
    "etymology": "「ある」 is a verb meaning \"to exist\" (for inanimate objects). When combined with 「が」 and a noun, it creates a descriptive phrase indicating possession or association.",
