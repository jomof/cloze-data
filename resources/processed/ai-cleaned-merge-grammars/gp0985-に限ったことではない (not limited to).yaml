jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to indicate that something is not exclusive to a particular thing or situation.
  nuance: Implies that the observed condition, problem, or observation extends beyond the initially mentioned
    subject, suggesting a broader or more widespread applicability. It challenges the assumption that
    the given case is unique or isolated.
  grammatical-role: Sets a boundary for a statement, then negates that boundary to broaden the scope.
    Often functions to normalize a situation or broaden an observation to a general truth.
  logical-flow: Introduces a specific case, then explicitly denies its exclusivity, leading to a broader
    generalization or universal implication.
  temporal-flow: Can apply to current observations or recurring phenomena over time, asserting that a
    pattern is not confined to a single instance or period.
  spatial-flow: Can refer to a condition not confined to a particular location or group, extending its
    relevance geographically or demographically.
etymology: 'The core of this grammar point lies in the verb 「限る」 (kagir-u), meaning ''to limit'' or ''to
  restrict''. Historically, this verb has been used to define boundaries or scope. The formation 「に限ったことではない」
  combines this concept of limitation with a negation: 「に」 indicates the scope of the limitation, 「限った」
  is the past tense (implying a completed action of limiting), 「こと」 literally means ''thing'' or ''matter''
  but here functions as a nominalizer for the preceding clause, and 「ではない」 negates the entire proposition.
  Thus, it literally means ''it is not a matter that is limited to [X]'', evolving to express that ''X
  is not the only case'' or ''it extends beyond X''. This construction emphasizes that a given situation
  or characteristic is not unique or exclusive to the mentioned subject, implying a broader applicability.'
writeup: 「に限ったことではない」 is a phrase used to express that something is not exclusively true for a particular
  person, thing, or situation. It conveys that the condition, problem, or observation extends beyond the
  initially mentioned subject, implying a broader or more widespread applicability. While its literal
  translation is 'it is not a thing/matter that is limited to (A)', its practical meaning is closer to
  'not limited to (A)', 'not only (A)', or 'not restricted to (A)'. This grammar point is commonly used
  when discussing observations, trends, or issues that might seem specific to one case but are, in fact,
  more universal or frequent. It adds an emphatic nuance, suggesting that the listener should consider
  the broader context. Although often encountered in formal or semi-formal settings, such as academic
  discussions or news reports, it can also appear in casual conversation to emphasize a shared experience
  or commonality, as demonstrated in some of the examples. It typically follows a noun or a noun phrase.
  It is crucial to understand that the phrase implies the mentioned item (A) is not an isolated or exceptional
  case; rather, it is part of a larger pattern. This expression is more about debunking the idea that
  something is unique to a specific group or situation, emphasizing its broader relevance. The slightly
  more conversational variant, 「に限った話ではない」, carries a similar meaning but often relates to a specific
  'story' or 'case' that is being discussed.

  - term: だけではない
    meaning: not only, not just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だけではない」 is a more direct and often simpler way to say 'not only'. Unlike 「に限ったことではない」, it
      does not carry the nuance of a wider, more general truth or that the specific instance is not special
      or should not be treated as such. It merely states that something else is also true.
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: のみならず
    meaning: not only, but also; in addition to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「のみならず」 is a more formal and literary expression, often used in written Japanese or formal
      speeches. It emphasizes the addition of another element, conveying 'not only A, but also B'. While
      similar in meaning to 「に限ったことではない」, it lacks the specific nuance of 'not being restricted to' a
      particular case, implying a broader, less exceptional situation.
    grammar_point: はもとより・のみならず (not only・let alone)
post_false_friends_writeup: To distinguish between these expressions, consider the emphasis. While 「だけではない」
  simply states that something is not exclusive, 「に限ったことではない」 implies that the given situation is not
  unique or special, suggesting it is a more common or widespread phenomenon. 「のみならず」, on the other hand,
  is a more formal way to add another element, indicating 'in addition to' or 'moreover'.

          - 若者 {だけ で は ない}。
        english: It's not just young people.
        hint: 「だけではない」 simply states that young people are not the only ones. We're looking for a phrase
          that implies this issue is a widespread phenomenon, not exclusive to young people, and part
          of a broader pattern.
    scene: A sociologist discussing the pervasive influence of technology across age groups, suggesting
      it's a societal phenomenon, not just a youth issue.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The speaker, an older male, uses 「若者がスマートフォンに依存する」 (young people relying on smartphones) as
      an initial observation, then immediately broadens it with 「に限ったことではない」, implying that this dependency
      is a widespread issue, not exclusive to youth. This adds a sense of universal truth to his observation.
    etymology: The formation 「に限ったことではない」 literally translates to "it is not a matter that is limited
      to," highlighting the denial of a perceived exclusivity. The use of 「こと」 here acts as a nominalizer,
      transforming the preceding phrase into a concept or situation that can then be negated. In this
      case, the 'matter' of smartphone reliance is not confined to just young people, making it a more
      general issue affecting society. The variant 「に限った話ではない」 similarly points to a 'story' or 'case'
      not being exclusive, often used when referring to a specific anecdote or reported instance that
      turns out to be more universal.
