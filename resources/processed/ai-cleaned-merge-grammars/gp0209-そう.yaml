    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「そう」 originates from the verb 「添う (そう)」, which means \"to accompany\" or \"to conform\". Over time, it evolved to express the idea of something appearing or seeming to conform to a certain state, based on observation or feeling.",
    "writeup": "「そう」 is an auxiliary adjective used to express that something \"seems\" or \"appears\" a certain way, based on direct observation or an immediate impression. It is frequently translated as \"seems like,\" \"looks like,\" or \"appears as though.\"\n\nThis 「そう」 primarily conveys a conjecture about a future event or the present state of someone or something, derived from visual cues or sensory input. It carries a relatively **low confidence level**, implying an educated guess rather than an obvious fact. For situations where something is evident or has a stronger resemblance, other expressions like 「みたい」 or 「らしい」 might be more suitable.\n\n### Formation Rules:\n*   **Verbs**: Attach 「そう」 to the **masu-stem** of a verb. For example, 「降ります (furimasu)」 becomes 「降りそう (furisou)」.\n*   **い-adjectives**: Remove the final 「い」 and attach 「そう」. For example, 「難しい (muzukashii)」 becomes 「難しそう (muzukashisou)」.\n*   **な-adjectives**: Attach 「そう」 directly to the stem. For example, 「静か (shizuka)」 becomes 「静かそう (shizukasou)」.\n\n### Negative Form Considerations:\nWhen expressing that something \"does not seem\" a certain way:\n*   For **い-adjectives**: The negative form often uses 「なさそう」. For example, 「美味しくない (oishikunai)」 (not delicious) becomes 「美味しくなさそう (oishikunasa sou)」 (doesn't look delicious). The 「さ」 is inserted before 「そう」.\n*   For **verbs**: The negative form commonly uses 「そうにない」 or 「そうもない」. For example, 「食べない (tabenai)」 (not eat) becomes 「食べそうにない (tabesou ni nai)」 (doesn't look like they'll eat). Note that these are idiomatic expressions and are often listed as separate grammar points due to their specific nuance of \"unlikely to.\"\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish this 「そう」 from the homophonous 「そうだ」 that means \"I heard that...\" (伝聞のそうだ), which conveys secondhand information rather than a visual impression. The formation and nuance differ significantly between the two.",
