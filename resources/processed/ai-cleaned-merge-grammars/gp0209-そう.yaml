    "etymology": "「そう」 derives from the verb 「添う (そう)」, meaning \"to accompany\" or \"to conform to\". In this grammatical context, it conveys the idea that something appears to 'conform to' or 'align with' a certain impression or appearance.",
    "writeup": "「そうだ」 is an auxiliary adjective indicating the speaker's conjecture about a future event or the present state of something, based on what they see or feel. It's translated as \"look like,\" \"appear,\" \"seem,\" or \"feel like.\" It indicates a judgment based on direct observation. This form can only be used when the speaker directly observes something; it cannot be used to express conjecture about a past event or state.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   This 「そうだ」 is used exclusively to make predictions/guesses about something based on visual information.\n*   It indicates relatively low confidence; do not use it for things that are obvious. In obvious cases, use 「みたい」 instead.\n*   When attaching 「そう」 to the negative adjective 「ない」, 「さ」 is inserted between 「な」 and 「そう」, creating 「なさそう」. This insertion of 「さ」 does not occur with verbs because the 「ない」 used with negative verbs is an auxiliary verb, not an adjective.",
