    "etymology": "The grammar point 「そう」 originates from the verb 「添う (そう)」, which means \"to accompany\" or \"to conform\". Over time, it evolved to express the idea of something appearing or seeming to conform to a certain state, based on observation or feeling.",
    "writeup": "「そう」 is used to express that something \"seems\" a certain way based on visual information or feeling. It's often translated as \"seems like,\" \"looks like,\" or \"appears as though.\"\n\n*   It is important to note that 「そう」 is used to make predictions or guesses based on **visual information**. It conveys a relatively **low confidence level**, so it should not be used for obvious things. In such cases, 「みたい」 would be more appropriate.\n*   When attaching 「そう」 to a negative い-adjective (ない), a unique conjugation rule applies: remove the い from ない and insert さ between な and そう, creating 「なさそう」. This insertion of さ does not occur with verbs.\n*   「そう」 can also mean 'I heard that', so be careful to not confuse the two.",
