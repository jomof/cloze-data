    "writeup": "The grammar point 「どんなに~(こと)か」 is used to express a strong feeling, surprise, or emphasis regarding the degree of something. It's similar to exclaiming \"How...!\" in English. The 「こと」 is optional but adds more emphasis to the feeling. This structure is versatile and can be used with verbs, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives to convey a high degree of emotion or realization. It is frequently used when the speaker wants to emphasize the extent of an action or a state, often reflecting on a past experience or realization. While suitable for formal speech, it is also appropriate in casual conversation to convey a high degree of emotion.",
    "etymology": "「どんな」 means \"what kind of\" or \"how much/many.\" 「に」 is a particle indicating degree. 「こと」 means \"thing\" or \"matter,\" and 「か」 is a question particle, though here it functions to create an exclamation.",
