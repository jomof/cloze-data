        "usage-context": "Expresses strong emotion, surprise, or admiration, often in an exclamatory or reflective context. Can also be used to indicate a degree of something that was not previously known or understood.",
        "function": "To intensify the degree of a verb or adjective, expressing exclamation or deep realization.",

    "etymology": "「どんなに」 means \"how much\" or \"to what extent.\" 「こと」 here is the nominalizer 「こと」, turning the preceding phrase into a noun clause that emphasizes the speaker's feelings.",
    "writeup": "「どんなに~(こと)か」 is a versatile expression used to convey a strong sense of degree, often with an exclamatory nuance. It translates to phrases like \"How...!\" or \"To what extent...!\" in English. This grammar point primarily functions in two main patterns:\n\n1.  **Exclamatory Usage (どんなに + Verb/Adjective + (こと)か)**:\n    This is the most direct use, serving as a strong exclamation about the extent of an action, state, or feeling. The inclusion of 「こと」 is optional but intensifies the speaker's subjective emotion, often adding a sense of awe, surprise, lament, or deep appreciation. It's frequently used when reflecting on past events or expressing a profound feeling.\n\n2.  **Embedded Clause Usage (どんなに + Verb/Adjective + か)**:\n    In this pattern, 「どんなに〜か」 forms a subordinate clause, often followed by verbs like 「知らない」 (shiranai, don't know) or 「分からなかった」 (wakaranakatta, didn't realize/understand). Here, it signifies that the degree or extent of something is, or was, beyond one's comprehension or prior knowledge. This usage often implies a realization that occurs after a certain experience.\n\nBoth patterns emphasize the *degree* of something, but the latter focuses on the speaker's lack of prior understanding or current inability to fully grasp that degree.",
