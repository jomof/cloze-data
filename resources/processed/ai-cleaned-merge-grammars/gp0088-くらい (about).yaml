    "writeup": "The particle 「くらい」, often interchangeable with 「ぐらい」 (which is more common in spoken language), primarily means \"about\" or \"approximately.\" Its origin lies in the kanji 「位」, signifying \"rank\" or \"grade.\"\n\n「くらい」 is typically used after numbers or counters to indicate an approximate quantity or amount. It can also follow question words like 「どの」 to inquire about the extent or degree of something. For instance, 「何時 {ぐらい} に 来ますか」 means, \"About what time will you come?\"\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   While 「くらい」 and 「ころ」 can be interchangeable when referring to a specific time (e.g., 5時くらい vs 5時ごろ), 「ころ」 is generally preferred when referring to broader periods or vague points in time (e.g., 昔のころ 'in olden times'), whereas 「くらい」 implies an extent or degree, making it more suitable for specific, quantifiable approximations. Therefore, they are not always interchangeable.\n*   「くらい」 and 「ぐらい」 are virtually interchangeable, but 「ぐらい」 is more commonly used in speech.",
