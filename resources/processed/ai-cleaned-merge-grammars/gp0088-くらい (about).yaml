    "etymology": "くらい comes from the kanji 「位」, which means 'rank' or 'grade'. This suggests that くらい originally indicated an estimated position on a scale.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「くらい」, often interchangeable with 「ぐらい」 (which is more common in spoken language), primarily means \"about\" or \"approximately.\" Its origin lies in the kanji 「位」, signifying \"rank\" or \"grade.\"\n\n「くらい」is typically used after numbers or counters to indicate an approximate quantity or amount. It can also follow question words like 「どの」 to inquire about the extent or degree of something. For instance, 何時{ぐらい}に来ますか means, \"About what time will you come?\"\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   While 「くらい」 and 「ころ」 can be interchangeable when referring to a specific time, 「ころ」 is generally preferred when referring to broader periods. This is because 「くらい」 inherently implies an extent or degree, which aligns well with specific times but less so with extended durations.\n*   「くらい」 and 「ぐらい」 are virtually interchangeable, but 「ぐらい」 is more commonly used in speech.",
