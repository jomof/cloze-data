It's often translated as \"about\" or \"approximately.\" It originates from the kanji 位, signifying \"rank\" or \"grade.\"  It generally follows numbers, counter words, or question words to indicate an approximate quantity or extent.  For instance, it can be used after question words like 「どの」, when inquiring about the extent or grade of something.",
