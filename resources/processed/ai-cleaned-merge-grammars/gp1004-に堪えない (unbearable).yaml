jlpt: N1
etymology: The grammar point 「に堪えない」 is derived from 「堪える(たえる)」, a verb meaning "to endure," "to bear,"
  or "to tolerate." The addition of 「ない」 negates this, creating the sense of something being unbearable
  or intolerable. The particle 「に」 functions to indicate the purpose or reason for the inability to endure.
  The affirmative form 「に堪える」, while also meaning 'can bear/tolerative', often specifically means 'is
  worth doing' or 'is suitable', stemming from the idea of being able to 'bear' or 'stand up to' a certain
  standard.
writeup: |-
  The expression 「に堪えない」 conveys the meaning of "cannot bear to," "cannot stand to," or "cannot tolerate." It is formed by combining the particle 「に」 with the negative form of the ru-verb 「堪える(たえる)」, meaning "to tolerate" or "to endure." When used with verbs, it signifies that an action or experience is so overwhelmingly unpleasant, unacceptable, or beyond one's capacity to endure that one simply cannot bring themselves to tolerate it. It expresses a strong, internal reaction of repulsion or extreme discomfort towards the subject, implying that the subject is objectively unbearable.

  Conversely, the affirmative form 「に堪える」 means "to be worth doing" or "to be suitable/passable." This usage suggests that something meets a certain standard or is acceptable for a particular purpose, even if it might not be ideal or was not originally intended for that use. For example, a worn-out item might still be 「使うに堪える」 (usable/worth using).

  It is important to differentiate 「堪える」 from other verbs with similar readings:
  *   **堪える (たえる)**: This refers to enduring or bearing something, often internally or emotionally. It is about one's capacity to tolerate or stand something.
  *   **耐える (たえる)**: This verb emphasizes withstanding or resisting something, often external forces like pain, pressure, or hardship. It suggests resilience or durability.
  *   **絶える (たえる)**: This means "to cease," "to run out," or "to become extinct." When used in the context of emotions or actions, such as 「笑いに絶えない」 (cannot stop laughing), it implies an uncontrollable outpouring rather than an ability or inability to bear something.

  - term: に堪える
    meaning: to be worth doing, to be passable
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「に堪えない」 which means 'cannot bear/tolerat', 「に堪える」 means 'can bear/tolerative' or, more
      commonly, 'is worth doing/tolerating' or 'is passable for'. This affirmative form indicates that
      something meets a certain standard or is acceptable, even if not ideal, or perhaps unexpectedly
      so.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:に堪える (is worth doing)
  - term: に耐えない
    meaning: cannot withstand, cannot endure
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While similar, 「に耐えない」 (from 「耐える」) emphasizes the inability to physically or mentally withstand
      something difficult, such as pain, pressure, or hardship. In contrast, 「に堪えない」 (from 「堪える」) focuses
      on a more abstract or emotional inability to tolerate or bear something due to its unacceptable
      or overwhelming nature, often implying an an internal, emotional repulsion.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:に耐えない (cannot withstand)
  - term: に絶えない
    meaning: cannot cease (doing something), cannot suppress (emotion)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This form, derived from 「絶える」 (to cease), is used when an action or emotion cannot be stopped
      or suppressed, such as 「笑い に 絶えない」 (cannot stop laughing), implying an uncontrollable outpouring
      rather than an ability or inability to bear something.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:に絶えない (cannot cease)
post_false_friends_writeup: To distinguish these expressions, remember that 「に堪えない」 focuses on an overwhelming
  inability to *tolerate* something due to its unacceptability or inherent unpleasantness. 「に耐えない」 is
  about an inability to *physically or mentally withstand* a difficult situation or pressure. 「に絶えない」,
  on the other hand, describes an *uncontrollable outpouring* of an emotion or action, where the action
  itself cannot be stopped or contained.

    speaker_gender: male

      exasperation.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

      seek agreement, making the sentence sound more feminine. Here, it conveys a shared exasperation,
      subtly inviting the listener's concurrence. The repeated 「ばかり」 (only/always) intensifies the negative
      feeling towards Tanaka-san's behavior, making his talk inherently unacceptable. 「悪口 (warukuchi)」
      meaning 'slander' or 'talking ill of others' is the source of the speaker's inability to tolerate
      the conversation.

          or unacceptable nature, implying an objective unbearable quality.
    scene: You are warning a friend about a horror movie you just watched, emphasizing how disturbing
      and difficult it was to look at certain parts.

    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The phrase 「正視 に 堪えない」 (cannot bear to look directly at) highlights the disturbing nature

      the visual horror.

      by the poor acting.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: The use of 「です」 at the end adds a general politeness, commonly used by speakers of all genders
      in polite contexts. The phrase 「大根役者」 (bad actor, literally 'daikon actor') is a common idiomatic
      expression for someone lacking acting skill, adding a casual, almost humorous, tone to the complaint,
      while 「見る に 堪えなかった」 conveys a strong, subjective inability to tolerate the poor performance.

    scene: You're at a karaoke party, and someone's singing is so off-key and painful that you subtly
      comment on it to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: The casual tone and setting suggest this is a private comment between friends. The adverb
      「酷すぎて」 (too terrible) vividly describes the singing voice's quality. This example shows an inability
      to endure a sensory experience due to its unpleasantness, a common reaction to bad singing in a
      casual context. The usage of 「聞く に 堪えなかった」 implies an objective level of unbearableness.

          its unacceptable or overwhelming nature, even if fascinating.
    scene: You're at a modern art exhibition, describing a strange and disturbing performance to a friend.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The formal register and the use of 「堪えません でし た」 suggest a more serious and considered reflection
      on the performance. The term 「奇妙」 (bizarre) points to the unusual nature that made it simultaneously
      captivating and difficult to endure.

      being a manga.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The positive nuance of 「に堪える」 here contrasts with the negative examples. 「内容 が とても よく」 (its
      content is very good) explains *why* it is worth reading. This usage emphasizes that the manga *meets
      a high standard* of quality, making it suitable and worthwhile even for a sophisticated audience
      like adults.

        english: It's an old car, but it can still be driven.
        hint: The potential form 「～できる」 simply states an linearity or possibility. We're looking for an
          expression that suggests something is suitable or adequate for a purpose, often implying it
          meets a certain standard despite potential drawbacks.
    scene: A car owner explaining the reliability of their older vehicle to a potential buyer, emphasizing
      its continued functionality.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: The phrase 「古い 車 ですが」 (It's an old car, but...) sets up a mild contrast. The polite form 「堪えます」
      is appropriate for a professional setting like selling a car. This example highlights that the car
      *meets the standard* for being driven, implying it is perfectly functional and adequate despite
      its age.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「に堪えない」 is used to express an inability to tolerate
  or bear something due to its unacceptable, overwhelming, or profoundly unpleasant nature. The feeling
  is strong and often implies an objective assessment of unbearableness. In contrast, 「に堪える」 conveys that
  something is suitable, passable, or worth doing, meaning it meets a certain standard or fulfills its
  purpose. Pay close attention to the context and the inherent quality of the object or action being described
  to correctly use these expressions.
