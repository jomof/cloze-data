The kanji for 謂 means \"oral tradition,\" highlighting how something is referred to over time or in different places.",
    "writeup": "いわゆる, occasionally written as 所謂 in kanji, is used before nouns to indicate that something is \"what is called (A),\" \"the so-called (A),\" or \"generally known as (A).\" It literally means \"what is said to be (A)\". It's a useful phrase to introduce a common term or concept.",
