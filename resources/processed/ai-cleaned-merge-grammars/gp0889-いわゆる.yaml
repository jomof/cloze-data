        "usage-context": "Used to introduce a term or concept that is commonly known or referred to by the speaker and listener, often with a slight nuance of generality, convention, or sometimes irony.",
        "function": "To specify a commonly accepted name or category for something, emphasizing its public recognition or widespread usage.",
        "nuance": "Suggests that the term being introduced is widely understood, or that the speaker is presenting it as a generally accepted label. It can occasionally imply skepticism or distance from the term, akin to 'so-called' in English.",

        "grammatical-role": "Noun modifier"
    },
    "etymology": "いわゆる is a combination of いわ, a modern variant of いは, the indeterminate form of 言う (iu) \"to say\", and ゆる, which is the classical literary equivalent of the auxiliary verb れる (reru), the displacement verb indicator in its attributive form. The kanji for 謂 means \"oral tradition,\" highlighting how something is referred to over time or in different places.",
    "writeup": "いわゆる, occasionally written as 所謂 in kanji, is used before nouns to indicate that something is \"what is called (A),\" \"the so-called (A),\" or \"generally known as (A).\" It literally means \"what is said to be (A)\". This phrase is crucial for introducing a common term or concept, suggesting that the speaker is referring to a widely recognized label or a conventional understanding. While its primary function is descriptive, it can sometimes carry a subtle nuance of skepticism or a detached perspective towards the term it introduces, much like the English 'so-called'.\n\n**Usage Notes:**\n*   **Scope**: いわゆる always precedes the noun or noun phrase it modifies.\n*   **Form**: The kanji form 所謂 is more formal and less common in everyday writing, often appearing in academic papers, legal documents, or very formal speeches. The hiragana form いわゆる is far more prevalent in general conversation and writing.\n*   **Nuance of Irony/Skepticism**: While often neutral, いわゆる can be used to imply that the speaker might not entirely agree with the term, or finds it somewhat misleading or superficial. For instance, referring to a 'so-called expert' can imply doubt about their expertise.",

            "nuance": "While both can translate to \"called,\" という is more versatile and used for quoting, specifying details, or generally linking a noun to a description. いわゆる is specifically for indicating a widely accepted or conventional term, often implying that the speaker is merely stating a common understanding."
