jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: general
  function: Expresses an attempt to perform an action or being on the verge of doing so, often with an
    implication of intention and effort. It also expresses unwillingness or lack of effort to do something.
  nuance: 「ようとする」 carries the nuance of intentional effort, implying a strong decision to act, but doesn't
    guarantee completion; it can also describe an action on the immediate verge of happening that was
    interrupted. The past form 「ようとした」 often suggests an unsuccessful or interrupted attempt. Conversely,
    「ようとしない」 expresses an active lack of willingness or effort, implying a deliberate choice not to act.
    This negative form often carries a negative connotation and is typically used to describe others'
    actions. For self-description, 「ようと思わない」 is generally preferred to avoid sounding abrupt or rude.
etymology: The grammar point 「ようとする」 combines the volitional form of a verb (indicating intent) with 「とする」
  (to try/attempt), literally meaning "to intend to try." By negating 「する」 to 「しない」, the form 「ようとしない」
  expresses 'to not try to do' or 'to be unwilling to do', highlighting an active choice or disposition
  to not undertake an action or effort.
writeup: |-
  The 「[Verb-volitional]とする・としない」 grammar point encompasses two related concepts: **trying to do something** or **being about to do something**, and conversely, **being unwilling to do something** or **not making an effort to do something**.

  When used as **「ようとする」**, it expresses an attempt to perform an action or being on the verge of doing so. This construction conveys a strong sense of the subject's intention and effort. While it signifies a clear decision to perform the action, it does not guarantee its completion. Often, the action may be unsuccessful or interrupted, particularly when used in the past tense 「ようとした」. For example, if you say 「家を出ようとしたら、雨が降り始めた」 (When I was about to leave the house, it started raining), it implies you had firmly decided to leave, but the rain intervened at the very last moment.

  Conversely, when used as **「ようとしない」**, it expresses a lack of willingness or active effort to do something. This form often carries a negative connotation, as it implies a deliberate choice not to undertake an action, or a stubborn refusal. It is typically used to describe the actions or inactions of others, and using it to describe oneself can sound abrupt or rude. In such cases, expressions like 「ようと思わない」 (I don't intend to/I don't think I will) are generally preferred for personal statements of intent. For example, describing an old car that won't start as 「エンジンがかかろうとしない」 personifies its 'unwillingness' to function.
false_friends:
  - term: (よ)う
    meaning: Let's, I shall (Casual volitional)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Verb[よう] is simply the volitional form, expressing intent or invitation. 「ようとする」 adds the
      nuance of actively *trying* or being *on the verge* of an action, focusing on the process of the
      attempt. 「ようとしない」 uses this form to express a lack of intention or willingness.
    grammar_point: (よ)う (let’s, shall we)
  - term: まだ～ていない
    meaning: Still haven't done (something)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「まだ〜ていません」 states that an action has not yet been completed, 「ようとする」 describes an attempt
      or being on the immediate verge of an action, regardless of its completion or lack thereof.
    grammar_point: まだ～ていない (still uncompleted)
  - term: '[Verb-dictionary]ところだ'
    meaning: About to, On the verge of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「るところだ」 focuses on the immediacy and state of being precisely on the verge of an action. 「ようとする」,
      while also indicating imminence, places more emphasis on the *intention* or *effort* leading up
      to the action, often implying an internal drive or a potential for interruption.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ところだ (about to do)'
  - term: ようにする
    meaning: To try to, To make sure to, To endeavor to
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「ようにする」 implies making a conscious effort to establish a habit or ensure something happens
      regularly over time. 「ようとする」 refers to a specific, immediate attempt. Unlike 「ようとしない」 which indicates
      a lack of effort, 「ようにする」 indicates an active attempt to do something.
    grammar_point: ようにする (make an effort to)
  - term: てみる
    meaning: To try to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てみる」 suggests trying something out of curiosity, experimentation, or to see the result. 「ようとする」
      implies a more determined, conscious effort or being on the point of doing something, with a stronger
      sense of purpose behind the action.
    grammar_point: てみる (try and see)
  - term: そうになる
    meaning: almost; on the verge of; close to (doing something)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そうになる」 means an action *nearly* happened, often involuntarily or accidentally, or indicates
      proximity to a state. 「ようとする」 implies *intention* or *effort* to reach that state or action, suggesting
      a more deliberate will.
    grammar_point: そうになる (almost・on the verge of)
  - term: '[Verb-dictionary]〜ところだった'
    meaning: Almost did; was on the verge of.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ところだった」 specifically means "was *on the verge* of doing something, but it didn't happen (often
      narrowly avoided)". It emphasizes the *near miss*. 「ようとした」 focuses on the *intention/attempt* that
      was then thwarted.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ところだった (was just about to)'
  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う
    meaning: I think I will; I'm thinking of; I intend to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようと思う」 expresses a pure statement of internal intent or a decision. 「ようとする」, while also indicating
      intent, adds the nuance of an *active attempt* to begin the action or being *on the verge* of doing
      it, focusing on the immediate process.
    grammar_point: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う (intend to or think I will)
post_false_friends_writeup: Distinguishing 「[Verb-volitional]とする・としない」 from similar expressions lies in
  its unique nuance of active, often thwarted, intention or immediate imminence on the one hand, and active
  unwillingness or stubborn refusal on the other. While other phrases might convey intent, attempt, or
  being on the verge of an action, 「ようとする」 uniquely combines these aspects with a focus on the subject's
  conscious will and the potential for an interruption or failure. Phrases like 「そうになる」 and 「ところだった」 indicate
  proximity to an action, but 「ようとする」 emphasizes the internal drive or conscious attempt to initiate that
  action. Conversely, 「ようとしない」 stands apart by emphasizing a deliberate decision *not* to make an effort
  or an active resistance, which is distinct from simply not doing something or lacking desire.
examples:
  - english: This baby tries to put anything in its mouth, so caution is necessary.
    japanese:
      - この 赤ん坊 は なん で も 口 に 入 {れよう と する} から、注意 が 必要 だ。
      - この 赤ん坊 は なん で も 口 に 入 {れよう と し ます} から、注意 が 必要 です。
      - この 赤ん坊 は なん で も 口 に 入 {れよう と する} ん で、気 を つけ て ね。

          - この 赤ん坊 は なん で も 口 に {入れる} から、注意 が 必要 だ。
        english: This baby puts anything in its mouth, so caution is necessary.
        hint: The original sentence emphasizes the baby's *tendency* or *attempt* to put things in its
          mouth, not just the action itself. We're looking for a grammar that expresses an internal inclination
          or effort.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 赤ん坊 は なん で も 口 に 入れ {かね ない} から、注意 が 必要 だ。
        english: This baby might put anything in its mouth, so caution is necessary.
        hint: 「～かねない」 implies a negative possibility or risk. We're looking for a grammar that describes
          the baby's attempt or inclination, not a potential negative outcome.
    scene: A new parent is talking to a friend about their baby's exploratory habits.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: Here, 「ようとする」 highlights the baby's inherent tendency or impulse to put things in its mouth,
      emphasizing an unconscious, almost instinctual, effort. This is common when describing the actions
      of animals or young children. The phrase 「口に入れる」 is a common collocation.
  - english: Every morning, I try to wake up early for my health.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 毎朝、健康 の ため に 早起き {しよう と し ます}。
      - 私 は 毎朝、健康 の ため に 早起き {しよう と する}。
      - 毎朝、健康 の ため に 早起き {しよう と する} ん だ。
    english_literally: I every morning, health for early rise try.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 毎朝、健康 の ため に 早起き する {よう に し ます}。
        english: Every morning, I make an effort to wake up early for my health.
        hint: While both express effort, 「ようにする」 is for establishing a habit or making an ongoing effort
          to ensure something happens regularly. 「ようとする」 emphasizes the *specific attempt* or intention
          at each instance. We're looking for an immediate, conscious attempt.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 毎朝、健康 の ため に 早起き し {たい です}。
        english: Every morning, I want to wake up early for my health.
        hint: 「～たいです」 expresses a desire or wish. We're looking for a grammar that expresses an active
          attempt or effort, not just a desire.
    scene: A person explains their daily routine and aspirations to a colleague.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: The use of 「ようとします」 indicates a continuous, conscious effort to wake up early for health.
      It implies that while the speaker makes the effort, it might not always be successful, or it requires
      consistent willpower. The polite form 「します」 fits the formal setting, while 「早起きする」 means 'to wake
      up early'.
  - english: He was about to stand up suddenly, but was stopped by the department manager.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 急 に 席 を 立 {ち よう と し た} が、部長 に 呼び止め られ た。
      - 彼 は 急 に 席 を 立 {ち よう と し まし た} が、部長 に 呼び止め られ まし た。
      - 彼 は 突然 席 を 立ち {上がろう と し た} の です が、部長 に 呼び止め られ て しまっ た。
    english_literally: He suddenly seat stand up was about to, but department manager by called to stop.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:

        english: He was precisely on the verge of standing up suddenly, but was stopped by the department
          manager.
        hint: Both express being on the verge, but 「ようとした」 highlights the subject's *intention* or *decision*
          to act, even if interrupted. 「ところだった」 more neutrally states the timing of the action, focusing
          on being 'at the point' of doing something. We're looking for a grammar that implies an intention
          that was thwarted.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 急 に 席 を 立っ {て い た} が、部長 に 呼び止め られ た。
        english: He was standing up suddenly, but was stopped by the department manager.
        hint: 「～ていた」 describes an ongoing action. 「ようとした」 means he was *about to* stand up, not already
          in the process. We're looking for a grammar that describes the immediacy of an action that was
          prevented.
    scene: During a meeting, a junior employee makes a move to leave but is interrupted by their boss.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The past form 「ようとした」 combined with 「が、〜された」 clearly indicates an action that was on the verge
      of happening but was interrupted. The nuance here is that the male employee had a definite intention
      to stand up, but his action was thwarted by the manager. This usage emphasizes the immediate imminence
      and the subsequent interruption. The verb 「呼び止められた」 means 'was called to stop'.
  - english: Trying to succeed in developing the new product, they worked day and night.
    japanese:
      - 新 製品 の 開発 に 成功 {しよう と し て}、彼 ら は 昼夜 を 問わ ず 働い た。

        english: In order to succeed in developing the new product, they worked day and night.
        hint: 「ために」 simply states the purpose. 「ようとして」 implies they were actively *trying* or *making
          an effort* to succeed, which was the driving force behind their work. We're looking for a grammar
          that indicates both purpose and ongoing effort.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新 製品 の 開発 に 成功 し {たい と 思っ て}、彼 ら は 昼夜 を 問わ ず 働い た。
        english: Wanting to succeed in developing the new product, they worked day and night.
        hint: 「～たいと思って」 means 'thinking they want to'. While it expresses desire, 「ようとして」 describes the
          active *attempt* or *effort* driven by that desire. We're looking for a grammar that indicates
          the process of trying, not just the underlying thought.
    scene: A project manager recounts the intense efforts of their team to deliver a new product.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The te-form 「ようとして」 indicates the continuous state of 'trying to' as the reason or manner
      for their intense work. It emphasizes that their tireless effort was driven by the strong intention
      to succeed in the new product development. This formal register is appropriate for a project manager
      reporting on a team's dedication. 「昼夜を問わず」 means 'day and night, without distinction'.
  - english: When a child is in trouble, is it okay for parents to naturally try to help them?
    japanese:
      - 子供 が 困っ て いる 時、親 は 自然 に 助 {け よう と し たら} いい の です か。
      - 子供 が 困っ て いる 時、親 は 自然 に 助 {け よう と し たら} いい の か な。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 が 困っ て いる 時、親 は 自然 に {助け たら} いい の です か。
        english: When a child is in trouble, is it okay for parents to naturally help them?
        hint: 「助けたら」 is a simple conditional 'if they help'. 「助けようとしたら」 specifically questions the appropriateness
          of acting on the *impulse* or *attempt* to help. We're looking for a grammar that includes the
          nuance of an innate inclination or attempt.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 が 困っ て いる 時、親 は 自然 に 助ける {べき です} か。
        english: When a child is in trouble, should parents naturally help them?
        hint: 「～べき」 expresses a moral obligation or strong recommendation. We're looking for a grammar
          that questions the appropriateness of acting on an innate inclination, not a duty.
    scene: A parent is asking for advice in a parenting forum or discussion.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    nuance: 「助けようとしたら」 in this context implies the natural, innate inclination or impulse parents might
      have to help their child. The conditional form questions whether it is 'good' or 'appropriate' to
      act on this impulse. The phrase 「自然に」 (naturally) further emphasizes this inherent tendency. This
      usage is less about a conscious 'attempt' and more about an automatic 'inclination'.
  - english: The player tried to score a goal, but unfortunately, it went wide.
    japanese:
      - 選手 は ゴール を 決 {め よう と し た} が、惜しく も 外れ て しまっ た。
      - 選手 は ゴール を 決 {め よう と し まし た} が、惜しく も 外れ て しまい まし た。

        english: The player tried scoring a goal (to see what would happen), but unfortunately, it went
          wide.
        hint: 「てみた」 suggests trying something out of curiosity or experimentation. 「ようとした」 implies a more
          determined, conscious effort with a strong sense of purpose. We're looking for a grammar that
          describes a determined attempt that was unsuccessful.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 選手 は ゴール を 決め {そう に なっ た} が、惜しく も 外れ て しまっ た。
        english: The player almost scored a goal, but unfortunately, it went wide.
        hint: 「～そうになる」 means to be on the verge of, or almost do something, often without explicit intent.
          「ようとした」 emphasizes the player's *intentional attempt* that was then thwarted. We're looking
          for a grammar that highlights the deliberate effort.
    scene: A sports commentator describes a pivotal moment in a soccer match.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: This sentence uses 「ようとした」 to describe a clear, intentional effort (「ゴールを決めようとした」 - 'tried
      to score a goal') that ultimately failed, as indicated by 「が、惜しくも外れてしまった」 ('but unfortunately, it
      went wide'). This nuance of a determined but unsuccessful attempt is central to 「ようとする」. The casual
      register is fitting for sports commentary. 「惜しくも」 means 'regrettably' or 'unfortunately'.
  - english: She was about to voice her opinion, but decided against it at the last moment.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 自分 の 意見 を 言 {おう と し た} が、土壇場 で やめ た。

        english: She was precisely on the verge of saying her opinion, but stopped at the last moment.
        hint: 「ところだった」 focuses on the precise timing of being on the verge. 「ようとした」 highlights the speaker's
          *intention* or *decision* to act, which was then aborted. We're looking for a grammar that emphasizes
          the internal decision that was thwarted.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 自分 の 意見 を {言っ た} が、土壇場 で やめ た。
        english: She said her opinion, but stopped at the last moment.
        hint: 「言った」 indicates the action of speaking actually happened, then stopped. 「言おうとした」 emphasizes
          the *intention* to speak, which was then aborted before the words came out. We're looking for
          a grammar that describes an intended action that never materialized.
    scene: A team meeting where a quiet member almost speaks up but changes her mind.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「言おうとした」 emphasizes the female speaker's *intention* or *decision* to speak, which she then
      actively suppressed. This highlights an internal process rather than just being on the cusp of an
      action, conveying her deliberate choice not to proceed. 「土壇場」 means 'at the last moment' or 'the
      eleventh hour'.
  - english: When I tried to close the window, it suddenly got stuck and wouldn't move.
    japanese:

        english: When I was precisely at the point of opening the window, it suddenly got stuck and wouldn't
          move.
        hint: 「ところだった」 describes the exact timing of being on the verge. 「ようとしたら」 implies the *attempt*
          or *initiation* of the action was met with the obstacle. We're looking for a grammar that emphasizes
          the moment the attempt was made.
    scene: Someone recounting a frustrating experience with a broken window.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    nuance: This sentence highlights an unexpected obstacle encountered *while in the process of trying*
      to do something. 「開けようとしたら」 means 'when I was about to open' or 'when I tried to open', clearly
      indicating the intention and the point at which the unexpected problem (「固まって動かなくなった」 - got stuck
      and wouldn't move) occurred. This is a common narrative use for thwarted attempts.

        english: Just as I was leaving the house, a sudden call came in.
        hint: 「～ところ」 describes the exact point in time. 「ようとした」 specifically highlights the *intention*
          or *decision* to leave at that moment, emphasizing the mental state leading up to the action.
          We're looking for a grammar that includes the nuance of firm intent at the point of interruption.
    scene: A person explains why they were delayed in their departure.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: Here, 「ようとしたところ」 precisely captures the moment of being on the verge of leaving, emphasizing
      that the speaker had a clear intention to depart, but it was interrupted by an external event (the
      phone call). The addition of 「ところ」 highlights the specific timing. This demonstrates the use of
      「ようとする」 to describe an action that was definitively intended but prevented.
  - english: He was about to apologize, but then his pride got in the way.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 謝 {ろう と し た} が、プライド が 邪魔 を し た。
      - 彼 は 謝 {ろう と し まし た} が、プライド が 邪魔 を し まし た。
      - あいつ は 謝 {ろう と し た} ん だ けど、意地 が 邪魔 し た ん だ よ。
    english_literally: He apologize was about to, but pride got in the way.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 謝り {たかっ た} が、プライド が 邪魔 を し た。
        english: He wanted to apologize, but his pride got in the way.
        hint: 「～たかった」 expresses a desire. 「謝ろうとした」 means he was *about to* apologize or *tried* to, indicating
          that he initiated the action, not just had the desire. We're looking for a grammar that describes
          the attempt to act.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 謝る {つもり だっ た} が、プライド が 邪魔 を し た。
        english: He intended to apologize, but his pride got in the way.
        hint: 「～つもりだった」 expresses a firm intention. 「謝ろうとした」 implies he actually began to act on that
          intention, or was on the very brink of doing so, before being stopped. We're looking for a grammar
          that emphasizes the attempt itself.
    scene: A friend describing another friend's stubbornness after an argument.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: This illustrates a mental 'attempt' that is thwarted by an internal obstacle (「プライドが邪魔をした」
      - his pride got in the way). 「謝ろうとした」 signifies that he formed the intention to apologize and was
      on the very verge of doing so, emphasizing his inner conflict before he stopped himself. This shows
      that the 'attempt' doesn't always have to be a physical action.
  - english: When I tried to close the door, the cat slipped out.
    japanese:
      - ドア を 閉 {め よう と し たら}、猫 が するり と 抜け出し た。
      - ドア を 閉 {め よう と し まし たら}、猫 が するり と 抜け出し まし た。
      - ドア を 閉 {め よう と し たら}、するり と 猫 が 出 て いっ た ん だ。
    english_literally: Door close was about to, cat slipped out.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ドア を 閉める {と}、猫 が するり と 抜け出し た。
        english: When I closed the door, the cat slipped out.
        hint: 「～と」 describes a natural, immediate consequence. 「閉めようとしたら」 means the action was *attempted*
          or *initiated* before the cat escaped, making the cat's action a consequence of the attempt,
          not the full closure. We're looking for a grammar that shows the action was about to happen
          when something else occurred.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ドア を 閉める {時}、猫 が するり と 抜け出し た。
        english: When closing the door, the cat slipped out.
        hint: 「～時」 indicates a general timeframe. 「閉めようとしたら」 specifies the exact moment of the *attempted*
          closure, leading to the cat's escape. We're looking for a grammar that emphasizes the action
          on the verge of completion.
    scene: A common situation for pet owners.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    nuance: This example vividly describes an action that was in progress, or on the verge of completion,
      when an unexpected event (the cat's escape) occurred. 「閉めようとしたら」 implies the speaker was actively
      trying to close the door, and that very attempt created the opportunity for the cat to slip out.
      「するり」 is an onomatopoeia for slipping smoothly and quickly.
  - english: No matter how much I tried to persuade him, he wasn't willing to listen, so I can no longer
      help him.
    japanese:
      - いくら 説得 {しよう と し なかっ た} の で、もう 彼 を 助ける こと は でき ない。
      - いくら 説得 {しよう と し ませ ん でし た} の で、もう 彼 を 助ける こと は でき ませ ん。
      - いくら 説得 {しよう と し なかっ た} から、もう あいつ は 助け られ ない。
    english_literally: How much persuade tried to didn't do, so already him help can't do.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - いくら 説得 し た が、彼 は {聞か なかっ た} の で、もう 彼 を 助ける こと は でき ない。
        english: No matter how much I tried to persuade him, he didn't listen, so I can no longer help
          him.
        hint: 「聞かなかった」 simply states that he did not listen. 「聞こうとしなかった」 conveys his *unwillingness* or
          *refusal to even try* to listen. We're looking for a grammar that expresses a lack of willingness.
      - competing_japanese:
          - いくら 説得 し た が、彼 は 聞く {つもり は なかっ た} の で、もう 彼 を 助ける こと は でき ない。
        english: No matter how much I persuaded him, he had no intention of listening, so I can no longer
          help him.
        hint: 「聞くつもりはなかった」 means he had no intention to listen. While similar in outcome, 「聞こうとしなかった」
          focuses on his *lack of effort or refusal to even attempt* listening. We're looking for a grammar
          that implies an active unwillingness.
    scene: A social worker discusses a difficult case with a colleague, expressing frustration.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「説得しようとしなかった」 explicitly states that 'he' (the person being persuaded) made no
      effort or showed no willingness to listen. This negative form emphasizes the subject's internal
      resistance or lack of desire to engage, rather than just a failure to be persuaded. The female speaker's
      frustration comes through this nuance. 「もう...できない」 emphasizes that it is 'no longer possible'.
  - english: Our cat won't take its medicine.
    japanese:
      - うち の 猫 は なぜ か、薬 を 飲 {もう と し ない}。
      - うち の 猫 は なぜ か、薬 を 飲 {もう と し ませ ん}。
      - どう いう わけ か、うち の 猫 は 薬 を 飲 {もう と し ない} ん だ。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - うち の 猫 は なぜ か、薬 を {飲ま ない}。
        english: For some reason, our cat doesn't drink its medicine.
        hint: 「飲まない」 means it simply doesn't drink it. 「飲もうとしない」 emphasizes the cat's *active resistance*
          or *unwillingness* to even attempt taking the medicine. We're looking for a grammar that expresses
          a lack of effort or refusal.
      - competing_japanese:
          - うち の 猫 は なぜ か、薬 を 飲む こと が {でき ない}。
        english: For some reason, our cat cannot take its medicine.
        hint: 「～ことができない」 means 'cannot do'. While true that the cat isn't taking the medicine, 「飲もうとしない」
          implies a lack of willingness rather than a lack of ability. We're looking for a grammar that
          conveys stubbornness or resistance.
    scene: A pet owner is lamenting their cat's stubbornness to the vet.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: Here, 「飲もうとしない」 highlights the cat's active resistance or unwillingness to even attempt taking
      the medicine, rather than simply stating it doesn't drink it. It implies a conscious (or instinctual)
      decision not to comply. The casual register fits the interaction between a pet owner and a vet regarding
      a common struggle. 「なぜか」 means 'for some reason'.
  - english: No matter how much I pushed, the heavy door wouldn't budge.
    japanese:
      - いくら 押し て も、その 重い ドア は 動 {こう と し なかっ た}。
      - いくら 押し て も、その 重い ドア は 動 {こう と し ませ ん でし た}。

          - いくら 押し て も、その 重い ドア は {動か なかっ た}。
        english: No matter how much I pushed, the heavy door didn't move.
        hint: 「動かなかった」 simply states that the door did not move. 「動こうとしなかった」 personifies the door, implying
          it *refused* to move or made no effort to, despite external force. We're looking for a grammar
          that expresses a lack of willingness or resistance from an inanimate object.
      - competing_japanese:
          - いくら 押し て も、その 重い ドア は 動き {よう が なかっ た}。
        english: No matter how much I pushed, there was no way the heavy door would move.
        hint: 「～ようがない」 means there's no way to do something due to inherent difficulty. 「動こうとしなかった」 implies
          the door was *unwilling* or *resisting*, giving it a sense of agency, rather than just being
          impossible to move. We're looking for a grammar that personifies the object's resistance.
    scene: Someone struggling to open a stubborn door in an old building.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: Even for inanimate objects, 「ようとしない」 can be used to describe their 'resistance' or 'unwillingness'
      to function as expected. Here, the door 'refused' to move, giving it a somewhat personified quality,
      which is a common usage to express frustration or an unexpected lack of compliance. 「いくら～ても」 means
      'no matter how much ~'.
  - english: No matter how much we persuade him, he won't try to change his mind.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は どんな に 説得 し て も、考え を 変えよう {と し ませ ん}。

        english: No matter how much we persuade him, he won't change his mind.
        hint: This is a simple negative polite form. The scene emphasizes his active unwillingness or
          refusal to even attempt to change, despite external pressure, which 『ようとしません』 captures more
          precisely. We're looking for a grammar point that expresses a deliberate choice not to exert
          effort towards an action, rather than simply stating that the action does not occur.
    scene: A team leader discusses a stubborn colleague during a meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    nuance: This usage highlights a stubborn individual's active unwillingness to even attempt a change
      of mind, despite external attempts at persuasion. It implies a conscious resistance rather than
      a mere inability to be swayed.
  - english: She refused to admit her mistake.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 自分 の 失敗 を 認めよう {と し なかっ た}。
      - 彼女 は 自分 の 失敗 を 認めよう {と し ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: She, her own mistake, tried not to admit.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 自分 の 失敗 を {認め なかっ た}。
        english: She didn't admit her mistake.
        hint: This is a simple past negative. The scene highlights her active unwillingness to make the
          effort to admit her mistake, rather than just stating that she didn't. We're looking for a grammar
          point that conveys a deliberate resistance to performing an action, not merely a statement that
          the action did not happen.
    scene: A supervisor recounts an employee's inability to take responsibility for an error.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: Here, 「認めようとしなかった」 emphasizes a deliberate internal refusal to acknowledge a mistake, implying
      an active decision against making the effort to admit it. This highlights a character trait of avoiding
      responsibility.

          - 新しい プロジェクト に は 誰 も {参加 し ない}。
        english: No one participates in the new project.
        hint: This is a simple negative. The scene highlights a collective unwillingness to exert the
          effort to join the project, which 『ようとしない』 conveys more emphatically. We're looking for a grammar
          point that expresses an active lack of willingness or effort to engage in an action, rather
          than just a simple negation of that action.
    scene: A project manager expresses frustration over a lack of volunteerism for a new initiative.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: This sentence describes a group's collective and active unwillingness to engage in a new project,
      emphasizing that they are not even attempting to participate. It points to a conscious avoidance
      or lack of enthusiasm.

        english: That politician doesn't listen to the voice of the people.
        hint: This is a simple negative polite. The scene emphasizes the politician's active refusal or
          lack of effort to heed public opinion, which 『ようとしません』 expresses more strongly. We're looking
          for a grammar point that expresses a deliberate unwillingness to act, not just a statement of
          non-action.
    scene: A concerned citizen discusses government policy with a friend, lamenting the lack of responsiveness.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)

        english: The child doesn't do their homework and just wants to play.
        hint: This is a simple negative. The scene points to the child's unwillingness to *make the effort*
          to even start homework, rather than just stating they aren't doing it. We're looking for a grammar
          point that highlights a deliberate decision not to exert effort towards an action, rather than
          simply stating that the action is not being performed.
    scene: A parent observes their child procrastinating on homework.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: This example vividly portrays a child's active refusal to engage with homework, highlighting
      their conscious decision to avoid effort and prioritize play. The phrase 「遊びたがっている」 (wants to play)
      further emphasizes this internal conflict and preference.

        hint: This is a simple past negative. The scene emphasizes her unwillingness to *make the effort*
          to ask for help, implying a more active choice that led to a negative consequence. We're looking
          for a grammar point that conveys a deliberate decision not to exert effort, leading to a specific
          outcome, rather than just stating the lack of action.
    scene: A friend reflects on how someone they know struggled because they wouldn't reach out for support.
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The te-form 「求めようとしなくて」 connects her active unwillingness to seek help directly to the negative
      consequence of carrying the burden alone. It highlights her internal decision as the cause of her
      struggle.

        hint: This expresses a simple failure to start. 『ようとしない』 implies a more deliberate resistance
          or active unwillingness of the engine to turn over. We're looking for a grammar point that personifies
          the car's resistance to starting, implying an active refusal, rather than just stating that
          it doesn't start.
    scene: A person is trying to start their decades-old car on a cold morning, but it's stubbornly refusing
      to ignite.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly

        hint: This simply states he doesn't understand. 『ようとしない』 highlights his active refusal or lack
          of effort to even attempt understanding, despite his stubbornness. We're looking for a grammar
          point that expresses a deliberate unwillingness to make an effort to understand, rather than
          just stating a lack of understanding.

        hint: This is a simple past negative. 『ようとしなかった』 conveys that she actively refused to make the
          effort to believe, not just that belief didn't happen. We're looking for a grammar point that
          emphasizes her active resistance to the action of believing, rather than simply stating that
          she didn't believe.
    scene: A man is recounting a past argument with his girlfriend where she remained unconvinced by his
      explanations.
    register: casual

    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「信じよう と し なかっ た」 highlights the speaker's frustration that despite his efforts,
      the listener (girlfriend) actively refused to make the effort to trust or believe him, implying
      a conscious unwillingness rather than just an inability to believe.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「[Verb-volitional]とする・としない」 flexibly expresses a
  range of meanings from a determined attempt or imminent action to an active unwillingness or stubborn
  resistance. The nuances vary significantly based on the positive or negative form, the specific verb,
  and the context. Paying close attention to the verb it modifies and the surrounding sentence structure
  will help you grasp the precise nuance in each situation, whether conveying a conscious effort, an inherent
  impulse, a thwarted action, or a deliberate refusal to act.
