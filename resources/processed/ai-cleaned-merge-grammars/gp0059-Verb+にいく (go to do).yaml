formation:
  '[Verb stem] + にいく': Indicates going somewhere to perform a specific action, focusing on the purpose
    of the movement
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General use for expressing purpose of movement. Can be conjugated to casual or polite
    forms.
  grammatical-role: Indicates the purpose or objective of the verb of movement (いく, くる, かえるなど)
etymology: The grammar point 「Verb+にいく」 combines a verb stem with the particle 「に」 and the verb 「いく」(to
  go). The 「に」 particle here indicates direction or purpose. Together, they express the idea of going
  *for the purpose of* doing something. This construction is a fundamental way to express intention and
  movement in Japanese, reflecting the importance of purpose in action. Historically, this use of 「に」
  as a purpose marker for verbs of movement is deeply ingrained in the language, deriving from its core
  function of marking a goal or destination.
writeup: 「Verb+にいく」 is used to express the act of going somewhere for a specific purpose. The verb preceding
  「にいく」 must be in its stem form (masu-stem), effectively making it a nominalized action. This construction
  translates to "to go to do something" or "to go in order to do something." The 「に」 particle here is
  crucial; it explicitly marks the purpose or objective of the movement, distinguishing it from simply
  stating a destination. For instance, while 「学校へ行く」(go to the school) states a destination, 「買い物 に 行く」(go
  to shop) specifies the reason for going. If you have already gone somewhere to do something, you would
  use 「(Verb stem) に 来た」 instead. This grammar point is essential for expressing intentions and activities
  involving movement. It is a highly versatile construction that can be adapted to various registers and
  conjugations depending on the context.
false_friends:
  - term: へいく
    meaning: To go to, To head toward
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「へ いく」 simply indicates the destination and doesn't imply the specific purpose of going for
      an action, unlike 「Verb+に いく」. For example, 「学校 へ いく」 means 'go to school,' but doesn't specify
      *why* you're going there beyond attending.
    grammar_point: へ (directional particle)
  - term: ていく
    meaning: To ~ and go, To start
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「て いく」 indicates a continuous action or a change over time, or an an action performed as one
      moves away, while 「Verb+に いく」 focuses solely on the purpose of going somewhere to perform an action.
      For instance, 「歩いて いく」 means 'go by walking,' focusing on the manner, not the purpose of the walking.
    grammar_point: Vて + くる (gradual change or continuation)
  - term: Verb (dictionary form)
    meaning: To do (action)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Simply using the verb in its dictionary form (e.g., 「映画 を 見る」) states the action itself without
      specifying movement for that purpose. 「Verb+に いく」 emphasizes that one is *going* somewhere to *perform*
      the action, adding the element of purposeful travel.
    grammar_point: Verbs (non-past plain)
  - term: Verb+にくる
    meaning: To come to do something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While Verb+にいく implies movement *away* from the speaker to perform an action, Verb+にくる implies
      movement *towards* the speaker (or current location) to perform an action. Both specify purpose,
      but the direction of movement is opposite.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb+にくる (come to do)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'When differentiating between these expressions, remember that 「Verb+にいく」
  is singular in its focus: the purpose of the movement. 「へいく」 clarifies the destination, while 「ていく」
  describes how an action unfolds over time or extends away from the speaker. The key is to recognize
  the core intent: purpose, destination, or continuation/change. Additionally, understand that simply
  stating the verb (e.g., 「食べる」) implies the action, but not necessarily that one is going somewhere to
  do it. 「食べに いく」 distinctly adds the element of purposeful movement. Furthermore, while similar in structure,
  「Verb+にいく」 expresses movement *away* from the speaker to fulfill a purpose, whereas 「Verb+にくる」 expresses
  movement *towards* the speaker for a purpose.'

      an appointment.

    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)
    nuance: The negative past polite form 「行きませんでした」 is appropriate for respectfully explaining why one

      in many contexts, especially if the speaker were female or addressing someone of higher status.

    nuance: The combination of the negative plain form 「見に いかない」 with 「つもりです」 clearly states the speaker's
      intention not to undertake the purposeful trip to see the game. This polite structure is suitable
      for informing others of one's plans.
post_example_writeup: The usage of 「Verb+にいく」 clearly specifies the purpose for which one undertakes a
  journey or movement. This construction is highly versatile and can be used with various verbs, always
  emphasizing the objective behind the action of going. Pay close attention to the verb stem, as it forms
  the core of the intended activity. While less common, it can also be conjugated into imperative forms
  like 「にいけ」 (go to do!) or 「にいかなさい」 (go to do!), typically used when giving a direct command to someone
  to perform a specific action by going somewhere.
