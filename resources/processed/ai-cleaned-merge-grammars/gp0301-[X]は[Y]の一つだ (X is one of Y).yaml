meaning: る-verbs in the negative past tense.
pronunciation:
  katakana: ル・バーブ (ネガティブ・パスト)
  romaji: ru-verb (negative-past)
formation:
  Verb (る-verb dictionary form) + なかった: This formation expresses the negative past tense for る-verbs,
    indicating that the action did not occur.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  function: Indicates that an action or state did not take place in the past for る-verbs.
  grammatical-role: conjugation
etymology: The negative past tense ending for る-verbs, 「なかった」, is a combination of 「ない」 (the plain negative
  form) and 「た」 (the plain past tense ending). This structure signifies 'did not (do/be)'. The 「な」 comes
  from the classical negative auxiliary 「ず」 (zu) which evolved into 「ない」, and the 「かった」 suffix is the
  past tense form for い-adjectives, which 「ない」 functions as grammatically.
writeup: |-
  The negative past tense for る-verbs is formed by taking the dictionary (plain) form of the verb, removing the final 「る」, and attaching 「なかった」. This conjugation expresses that an action *did not occur* in the past. It is the plain form, meaning it is used in casual conversations and can be used when speaking to oneself or close friends and family. For polite situations, you would use 「ませんでした」.

  This form is essential for recounting past events that did not happen, or for denying previous actions. It directly negates the past occurrence of the verb's action.

  - term: なかった
    meaning: Was not (for い-adjectives or nouns with ない)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both use 「なかった」, the grammar point 「る-verb (negative-past)」 (e.g., 「食べなかった」) attaches
      it to the stem of a る-verb. The standalone 「なかった」 is the past negative of 「ない」 for い-adjectives
      (e.g., 「楽しくなかった」) or nouns/な-adjectives when used with 「じゃない」 (e.g., 「学生じゃなかった」). The grammatical
      attachment and the word it modifies differ.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:い-adjective (past negative)
  - term: る-verb (negative plain)
    meaning: る-verbs in the negative plain tense (present/future)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「る-verb (negative-past)」 (e.g., 「食べなかった」 - didn't eat) specifies an action *did not happen*
      in the past. In contrast, 「る-verb (negative plain)」 (e.g., 「食べない」 - don't eat/won't eat) indicates
      an action *does not or will not happen* in the present or future, or expresses a general negative
      state without a past timeframe.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:る-verb (negative plain)
post_false_friends_writeup: When using 「なかった」, pay close attention to what it is attaching to. If it follows
  the stem of a る-verb (e.g., 「見なかった」, 「寝なかった」), it signifies 'did not do'. If it follows 「く」 (as in い-adjectives,
  e.g., 「寒くなかった」), it means 'was not'. Similarly, distinguish it from the non-past negative form, which
  lacks the 「かっ」 portion, as it changes the temporal aspect of the negation.
