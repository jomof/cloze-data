details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: Generally used in everyday situations.
  logical-flow: Implies a causal relationship where an internal impulse or lack of resistance leads to
    an unintended action.
  temporal-flow: Can indicate an action performed momentarily or just recently.
  spatial-flow: Not applicable to spatial flow, primarily deals with internal states or actions over time.
etymology: The origin of 「つい」 is somewhat debated, but it is often linked to the idea of a momentary lapse

writeup: The adverb 「つい」 is used to describe actions done unintentionally, unconsciously, or against one's
  better judgment. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence and is frequently paired with 「てしまう」
  to emphasize the unintentional nature of the action. It expresses a momentary lapse or yielding to impulse,
  similar to the English word "lapse." This often implies a lack of foresight or an inability to control
  one's own actions, even when one knows better. It is gender neutral and age-independent.Beyond describing
  impulsive or unintentional actions, 「つい」 also functions to indicate that something happened "just now"
  or "very recently," emphasizing the immediate past. This temporal usage, such as in 「つい さっき」 (just a
  moment ago), highlights the close proximity of an event to the present moment. While seemingly distinct
  from its 'unintentional' meaning, both uses share an underlying sense of immediacy or a sudden, fleeting
  nature.

  - term: いつの間にか
    meaning: suddenly, unnoticed, without noticing, too soon
    kind: similar expression

  - term: うっかり
    meaning: carelessly, inadvertently
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「つい」, 「うっかり」 suggests a momentary lapse in attention or a mistake due to carelessness.

  - term: 思わず
    meaning: unintentionally, involuntarily
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While similar to 「つい」, 「思わず」 emphasizes a more immediate, reflexive reaction, often triggered
      by a specific stimulus. It implies an action that happens without conscious thought or control,
      often as a direct response to something.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:思わず (involuntarily)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「つい」, 「いつの間にか」, 「うっかり」, and 「思わず」 all relate to actions done unintentionally,
  they each have slightly different nuances. 「つい」 emphasizes acting on impulse or against better judgment,
  or refers to a very recent past. 「いつの間にか」 highlights gradual changes or unnoticed events over time.
  「うっかり」 suggests a careless mistake or oversight due to lack of attention. 「思わず」 focuses on reflexive
  reactions made without conscious thought. Being mindful of these differences will lead to more accurate
  and natural expression.
