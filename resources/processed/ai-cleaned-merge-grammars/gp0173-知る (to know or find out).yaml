jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express the acquisition of knowledge or the state of possessing knowledge.
  function: To indicate possession of knowledge, or the act of acquiring knowledge.
  nuance: 知る (shiru) primarily implies actively coming to know something or having knowledge of something.
    It often focuses on the factual content or awareness.
  grammatical-role: Acts as the predicate of a sentence, describing the subject's relationship with information
    or awareness.
etymology: The verb 知る (shiru) has ancient roots, and its original meaning encompassed both 'to know'
  and 'to perceive.' Over time, while its core meaning of 'to know' has remained, it also acquired the
  nuance of 'to find out' or 'to learn' through experience or discovery. This dual nature reflects how
  knowledge is acquired and possessed, and the dynamic process of becoming aware.
writeup: |-
  知る (shiru) is a fundamental Japanese verb meaning "to know" or "to find out." It is used to express that one has acquired information, is aware of a fact, or has learned something. Unlike 分かる (wakaru), which often implies understanding or comprehension, 知る (shiru) focuses more on the possession or acquisition of information itself. For instance, you might 知る a person's name (you know their name), but 分かる their feelings (you understand their feelings).

  When used to mean "to know," it typically refers to knowledge of facts, people, places, or skills. When it means "to find out," it suggests the discovery or learning of new information. The plain past form 知った (shitta) is frequently used in this sense, indicating the moment of discovery.

  The verb 知る (shiru) can be used with various particles depending on the context. For knowing a fact or specific information, を (o) is common, e.g., その事実を{知っています}か (Do you know that fact?). For knowing a person or place, を (o) or に (ni) can be used, though を (o) is more common for direct knowledge. When referring to the result of an action, such as 'learning about something,' に (ni) might be used with a nominalized clause, e.g., 彼の計画について{知った} (I found out about his plan).

  - term: 分かる
    meaning: to understand, to comprehend
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 知る is about possessing information or fact, 分かる is about grasping the meaning, concept,
      or being able to follow. You can 知る (know) a word but not 分かる (understand) its usage.
    grammar_point: 分かる (understand and know)
  - term: 学ぶ
    meaning: to learn, to study
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 学ぶ emphasizes the process of acquiring knowledge or skills through study or experience, often
      over a period of time. 知る can be a more immediate acquisition of a fact or an existing state of
      knowledge, without the implication of a learning process.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:学ぶ (to learn or study)
  - term: 覚える
    meaning: to memorize, to remember
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 覚える focuses on committing information to memory or recalling it, whereas 知る is about having
      the information or discovering it. You might 覚える (memorize) a phone number, but then 知る (know/have)
      that number after memorizing it.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:覚える (to memorize or remember)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  When distinguishing 知る from 分かる, remember that 知る relates to factual knowledge or awareness, while 分かる is about comprehension and understanding. For example, あなたの名前を{知っています} (I know your name) uses 知る, but 彼の気持ちが{分かります} (I understand his feelings) uses 分かる.

  Compared to 学ぶ, 知る is less about the process of learning and more about the outcome of possessing information. 学ぶ implies a deliberate effort to acquire knowledge or a skill. Similarly, 覚える is specifically about committing something to memory. You might 覚える (memorize) a phrase, and through that act, you come to 知る (know) its meaning.

  emphasis on the type of knowledge or the process of acquisition.
