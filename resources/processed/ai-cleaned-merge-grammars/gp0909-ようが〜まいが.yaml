        "usage-context": "Used to express that a situation or outcome will remain unchanged regardless of two opposing possibilities or conditions. It conveys a strong sense of determination or indifference.",
        "function": "Conjunctive particle and auxiliary verb combination, indicating concession and emphasizing inevitability.",
        "nuance": "This pattern carries a strong, emphatic nuance. It implies that the speaker's will, decision, or the situation's outcome is fixed and will not be swayed by the opposing conditions mentioned. It is more assertive than simpler concessive forms like 「ても」.",
        "source": "Derived from volitional and negative volitional forms paired with the concessive particle が.",
        "grammatical-role": "Acts as a conjunction, connecting two contrasting clauses where the second clause's outcome is independent of the first's conditions."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed by combining the volitional form of a verb (う or よう) with the negative volitional form (まい), joined by the particle が. The volitional form, originating from classical Japanese, expresses intent or possibility, while まい (a contraction of まい+ある) serves as a negative volitional or presumptive. The particle が, functioning concessively, links these two opposing possibilities. Historically, the structure reflects a robust expression of indifference to outcomes, implying 'whether it is to be so or not to be so, still X.'",
    "writeup": "The structure 「ようが〜まいが」 combines the positive and negative volitional forms of a verb to express that, **regardless of whether something happens or not**, the result will be the same. It is an emphatic way of stating \"whether or not (A), (B) will happen.\" The particle が is used after both the positive and negative forms.\n\nWhile this pattern is most commonly used with verbs (e.g., 行こうが 行くまいが), it can also be applied to い-adjectives and な-adjectives/nouns. For い-adjectives, the hypothetical volitional form (かろう) is used, and for な-adjectives and nouns, the auxiliary verb だ conjugates to であろう or だろう. In cases where まい cannot be used (i.e., with adjectives and nouns), an antonym or a contrasting concept is typically paired with the positive volitional form (e.g., 難しかろうが 易しかろうが, 社長であろうが 平社員であろうが). This creates a similar 'whether or not' meaning.\n\nThis grammar pattern often reflects the speaker's strong will, determination, or unwavering opinion that will not change, irrespective of the conditions described. It conveys a sense of certainty about the inevitable outcome or the speaker's resolve.",
