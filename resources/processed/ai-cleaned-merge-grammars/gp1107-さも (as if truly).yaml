  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: Used when describing someone's actions or behavior, often implying that the appearance

    pretense, exaggeration, or a strikingly evident mannerism.
  nuance: Carries a nuance of the appearance being striking, sometimes to the point of being feigned or
    exaggerated, even if it is genuinely felt. It often conveys a slight critical or disbelieving tone
    on the part of the speaker regarding the sincerity of the observed behavior.
  grammatical-role: Modifies verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses to emphasize appearance or manner
etymology: The exact etymology of 「さも」 is not definitively known, but it is widely believed to originate

  striking or conspicuous nature of the an appearance, often carrying the implication of a perceived pretense
  or exaggeration.
writeup: |-
  「さも」 is an adverb used to describe how someone's actions or a situation appears, often emphasizing the intensity or striking nature of that appearance. It can be translated as "as if," "truly," "really," or "seemingly."

  The most common use of 「さも」 is to describe an action or state that is presented with a strong, sometimes exaggerated, outward appearance. This often implies that the speaker perceives an element of pretense, artificiality, or overemphasis in the observed behavior. For instance, if someone is acting with an air of superiority, you might say 「さも偉そうにしている」 (acting as if they're so great).

  「さも」 frequently precedes forms like 「～そう」 (looks like), 「～よう」 (as if), or 「～みたい」 (as if), strengthening the impression conveyed by these expressions. It highlights that the manner or appearance is particularly conspicuous. While it can simply mean "truly" or "really" to intensify a description, its usage often subtly suggests that the speaker is commenting on the *way* something appears, rather than simply stating a fact.

  It is commonly used in narrative contexts or when commenting on someone's observable behavior, making it a versatile adverb for expressing nuanced observations.

  - term: いかにも
    meaning: Indeed; really; truly; typical; very
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いかにも」 also conveys 'indeed' or 'really' but emphasizes typicality or obviousness rather than
      pretense. Unlike 「さも」, it doesn't necessarily imply insincerity or exaggeration, focusing more on
      what is natural or expected.
    grammar_point: いかにも (as expected)
  - term: まるで
    meaning: Quite; entirely; completely; as if; as though; like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「まるで」 means 'as if' or 'as though' and is primarily used for direct comparisons, indicating
      strong resemblance. It typically does not carry the implication of insincerity or affectation that
      「さも」 often suggests when describing a manner or appearance.
    grammar_point: まるで…ようだ (just like)
  - term: 本当に
    meaning: Truly; genuinely; really; indeed
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「本当に」 emphasizes genuine truth or sincerity, lacking the nuance of feigned appearance or striking
      exaggeration often present with 「さも」. While both can mean 'truly', 「さも」 focuses on the conspicuous
      appearance rather than the inherent reality.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:本当に (genuinely)
  - term: とばかりに
    meaning: As if (to say); seeming that; as if it implies
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とばかりに」 emphasizes an action performed as if to convey a specific message or intention, often
      implying a deliberate, overt display. While 「さも」 describes a striking appearance, 「とばかりに」 focuses
      more on the implied message or reason behind an action, almost like a non-verbal statement.
    grammar_point: とばかりに (as if to say)
  - term: 〜よう
    meaning: Seems; appears; looks like; as if
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜よう」 generally indicates a subjective impression or resemblance. While 「さも」 often intensifies
      this appearance, it specifically adds a nuance of strikingness, exaggeration, or potential insincerity
      that 「〜よう」 alone does not inherently carry. 「さも」 often implies a more deliberate or conspicuous
      presentation of the appearance.
    grammar_point: ようだ (it seems)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  When distinguishing 「さも」 from similar expressions, it is crucial to focus on the nuance of striking appearance and potential exaggeration or pretense. While 「いかにも」 emphasizes typicality or what is expected, and 「まるで」 focuses on a direct, strong resemblance ('just like'), 「さも」 highlights an appearance that is conspicuously presented, often subtly suggesting it might be feigned or overdone. For instance, 「いかにも彼らしい」 means 'that's just like him,' emphasizing typical behavior, whereas 「さも彼らしい」 might imply he's acting as if he's being typical, perhaps to make a point.

  Furthermore, 「本当に」 conveys genuine truth or sincerity, directly contrasting with the potential for insincerity that 「さも」 can imply when describing a manner. While both can translate to 'truly', 「さも」 points to how strikingly real something appears, rather than its inherent genuineness.

  Lastly, 「とばかりに」 focuses on actions performed as if to convey a message, making a non-verbal statement. 「さも」, on the other hand, describes the manner of appearance itself as being striking or exaggerated, without necessarily implying a specific message from the actor. Although 「さも」 often modifies expressions like 「〜そう」 and 「〜よう」, it intensifies them by adding the strong implication of conspicuousness or a subtly observed pretense, which the basic 「〜そう」 or 「〜よう」 forms do not inherently carry.

          - 彼 は {本当 に} 大変 みたい に 病気 の ふり を し た が、ただ かまっ て ほしい だけ だっ た。
        english: He genuinely acted as if he was suffering greatly, but it was just for attention.

          great suffering, not its genuineness.

        english: He pretended to be sick, acting as if he was suffering greatly, but it was just for attention.
        hint: まるで is a direct comparison. We're looking for a word that emphasizes the *exaggerated* and
          *conspicuous* display of suffering, implying it's not real.
    scene: A child exaggerates their illness to get their parents' attention, making a dramatic display
      of their discomfort.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「さも」 emphasizes the exaggerated and conspicuous display of suffering (「大変みたいに」) when he pretended
      to be sick. This highlights the insincerity and performative nature of his actions, implying it
      was done solely for attention.
  - english: He answered the difficult question as if he knew the answer from the start.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 難しい 問題 に、{さ も} 最初 から 知っ て い た か の よう に 答え た。
      - 彼 は 難しい 問題 に、{さ も} 最初 から 知っ て い た か の よう に 答え まし た。

          - 彼 は 難しい 問題 に、{いかに も} 最初 から 知っ て い た か の よう に 答え た。
        english: He answered the difficult question as if he had indeed known the answer from the start.
        hint: いかにも emphasizes typicality or what is expected. We're looking for a word that highlights
          the striking or perhaps feigned nature of his 'knowing' from the start, despite the difficulty.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 難しい 問題 に、{まるで} 最初 から 知っ て い た か の よう に 答え た。
        english: He answered the difficult question as if he knew the answer from the start.
        hint: まるで is a general comparison. We're looking for a word that emphasizes the *conspicuous*
          display of foreknowledge, suggesting it might be put on for effect.
    scene: A student confidently answers a pop quiz question, but his classmate suspects he just quickly
      looked up the answer.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「さも」 here emphasizes the exaggerated confidence and the *appearance* of having known the answer
      all along (「最初から知っていたかのように」), suggesting a subtle pretense or a display of false knowledge, common
      when trying to impress.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「さも」 can be used across various registers and settings,
  either to imply a perceived insincerity or exaggeration in someone's behavior, or simply to emphasize
  the striking and evident nature of a state or quality. The key is its focus on *appearance* and its
  tendency to highlight something as remarkably conspicuous.
