    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に則って」 comes from the verb 「則る (のっとる)」, which means \"to conform to\" or \"to be based on\". The 「に」 indicates the standard or rule being followed, and the 「～て」 form turns it into an adverbial phrase. 「に則り」 is the ます-stem form of the verb, used to create a more formal, noun-like phrase.",
    "writeup": "「に則って」 is a formal expression used to indicate that something is done \"according to (A)\" or \"in line with (A)\". Typically, \"A\" is a long-standing basis, foundation, or standard such as laws, traditions, or codes of conduct. The particle 「に」 combines with the te-form of the verb 「則る」 (to follow along with). The literal meaning is that (B) follows along with (A). The kanji and hiragana forms are both common. Because (A) generally has a foundation, it represents something with an inception point that has changed little. This includes laws, traditions, standards, codes of conduct, etc.",
