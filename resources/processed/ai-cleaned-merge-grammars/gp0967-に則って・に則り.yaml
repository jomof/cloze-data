    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に則って」 comes from 「則る(のっとる)」, which means \"to conform to\", \"to follow\", or \"to be based on\". The 「に」 indicates the basis or standard being followed, and the 「て」 form connects it to the action or situation that is in accordance.",
    "writeup": "「に則って」 is a formal expression used when something is being done \"according to (A)\", or \"in line with (A)\". This is usually some basis, foundation, or standard with a long running history. The case-marking particle 「に」 is combined with the て-form of the う-Verb 「則る(のっとる)」 \"to follow along with\" in this grammar pattern. Based on this, the literal meaning is that (B) is something that follows along with (A).\n\nWhile several forms may be seen, the most common are a noun followed by 「に則って」, or a noun followed by 「に則った」 which will then modify a second noun.\n\nBoth the kanji form and the plain hiragana form are quite common, so it will be helpful to remember both.\n\nAs (A) is generally considered to be something that has some kind of foundation, it will mostly represent a thing that has some kind of inception point from which point little, if anything, changed. Some examples are laws, traditions, standards, codes of conduct, etc.",
