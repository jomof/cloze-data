    "etymology": "The suffix さ is believed to have originated from the kanji 差 (sa), meaning \"distinction.\" It was initially used to emphasize the distinctive features of something. While less common in modern Japanese, さ can also follow the dictionary form of verbs to highlight a specific point in time, a usage primarily found in older, more poetic language.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「さ」 in Japanese is attached to the stem of い-adjectives and な-adjectives. This transforms the adjective into a noun that represents the **degree** or **extent** of that quality. Think of it as adding \"-ness\" or \"-ity\" in English: sweetness, tallness, beauty, etc. Although less frequent, 「さ」 can also follow the dictionary form of verbs in poetic contexts to pinpoint a specific moment or instance. This use is primarily found in older, more literary Japanese.",
