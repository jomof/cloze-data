    "etymology": "The suffix さ is believed to have originated from the kanji 差 (さ), meaning \"distinction\" or \"difference.\" It was initially used to emphasize distinctive features. Its use with verbs is now considered archaic, primarily found in older texts or poetry.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「さ」 attaches to the stem of *i*-adjectives (い形容詞) and *na*-adjectives (な形容詞) to transform them into nouns. This noun represents the \"degree\" or \"extent\" of the quality described by the adjective.  It often translates to '-ness' or '-ity' in English, such as \"sweetness\" or \"beauty.\" For example, 「高さ」(takasa) means height (from 「高い」- takai - tall, high), and 「静かさ」(shizukasa) means quietness (from 「静かだ」- shizuka da - quiet). While less common in modern Japanese, 「さ」 was historically used with verbs in dictionary form to highlight a specific point in time, mainly in poetic or literary contexts. This usage is now rare.",
