    "etymology": "The suffix さ is believed to have originated from the kanji 差 (sa), meaning \"distinction.\" It was initially used to emphasize the distinctive features of something. While less common in modern Japanese, さ can also follow the dictionary form of verbs to highlight a specific point in time, a usage primarily found in older, more poetic language.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「さ」 in Japanese is attached to the stem of い-adjectives and な-adjectives. This transforms the adjective into a noun that represents the **degree** or **extent** of that quality. Think of it as adding \"-ness\" or \"-ity\" in English: sweetness, tallness, beauty, etc. Although less frequent, 「さ」 can also follow the dictionary form of verbs in poetic contexts to pinpoint a specific moment or instance. This use is primarily found in older, more literary Japanese.",

            "meaning": "~ness, Used to indicate conditions or nature",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "While 「さ」 generally refers to the *degree* or *measurable extent* of a quality (e.g., 長さ for length, 重さ for weight), 「み」 often describes the *nature*, *condition*, or *inherent quality* itself, sometimes with a nuance of feeling or deeper implication (e.g., 深み for profoundness, 悲しみ for sadness). For example, 「深さ」 (fukasa) means 'depth' as a measurement, while 「深み」 (fukami) means 'depth' as in 'profoundness' or 'richness'."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate between 「さ」 and 「み」, consider whether you are emphasizing the quantifiable measure or extent of something versus its inherent quality or state. If you're talking about the amount, size, or a measurable characteristic, use 「さ」. If you're describing an inherent condition, a subjective feeling, or a deeper quality that isn't necessarily quantifiable, 「み」 is often more appropriate.",
