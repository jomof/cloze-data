    "etymology": "The etymology of 「すら」 is not definitively known, but it's believed to be derived from an older form of the verb 「する」 (to do), implying something 'to the extent of doing even this'. It adds a sense of unexpectedness or extremity to the statement.",
    "writeup": "「すら」 is an adverbial particle in Japanese that translates to \"even.\" It presents extreme examples to which a rule applies, implying it also applies to less extreme examples. It's often used with a negative nuance.\n\nAs an adverbial particle, it follows nouns or nouns with case-marking particles. 「すら」 can be followed by 「も」 to emphasize the point further.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   「すら」 is more formal than 「さえ」 and can't be used in the 「さえ〜ば」 construction.\n*   「すら」 emphasizes the extreme end of a group, while 「さえ」 emphasizes a specific individual.\n\nFun fact: 「は、も、さえ、and すら」 share a linear relationship in intensity:\n\n*   (A) は - (A) is as expected.\n*   (A) も - (A) also fits, possibly surprising.\n*   (A) さえ - (A) also fits, quite surprising.\n*   (A) すら - (A) is the most extreme example.",
