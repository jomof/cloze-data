    "etymology": "The particle 「すら」 is believed to have originated from the verb 「する」 (suru, to do). Over time, it evolved to emphasize the extreme nature of a statement, highlighting that if something applies even to the most unlikely case, it certainly applies to all other cases as well.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「すら」, meaning \"even,\" is used to emphasize that if something is true even in an extreme case, it's certainly true in less extreme cases. It often carries a negative nuance. 「すら」 is considered more formal than 「さえ」 and is placed directly after nouns or nouns followed by case-marking particles. It implies that the example being given is the most extreme possible. You may also see 「すら」 followed by 「も」 for extra emphasis, though this is less common.",

            "setting": "sarcastic",
            "nuance": "Using 「すら」 here highlights the speaker's astonishment that the listener is incapable of something so simple. The phrase 「お前」 makes the sentence casual."
