        "[Noun] + すら": "Indicates 'even [noun]' or 'not even [noun],' emphasizing the unexpectedness or extremity of the statement."

    "etymology": "The particle 「すら」 is believed to have originated from the verb 「する」 (suru, to do). Over time, it evolved to emphasize the extreme nature of a statement, highlighting that if something applies even to the most unlikely case, it certainly applies to all other less extreme examples.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「すら」, meaning \"even,\" is used to emphasize that if something is true even in an extreme case, it's certainly true in less extreme cases. It often carries a negative nuance. 「すら」 is considered more formal than 「さえ」 and is placed directly after nouns or nouns followed by case-marking particles. It implies that the example being given is the most extreme possible. You may also see 「すら」 followed by 「も」 for extra emphasis, though this is less common.",
