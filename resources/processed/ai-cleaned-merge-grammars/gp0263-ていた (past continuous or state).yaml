formation:
  Verb[て] form + いた: Describes an action that was ongoing in the past, a state that existed in the past,
    or a habitual action in the past.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  function: Indicates an action in progress in the past, a continuous state in the past, or a repeated
    action in the past.
  grammatical-role: Auxiliary verb modifying a main verb.
  temporal-flow: Indicates an action or state that continued over a period of time in the past, or was
    in progress at a specific point in the past.
etymology: The {ていた} form combines the te-form of a verb with いた, the past tense of いる. Historically,
  いる evolved from 居る, meaning "to be (in a place), to exist," which over time broadened its function to
  become an auxiliary verb indicating continuous action or state. This reflects a common linguistic process
  where verbs denoting existence or position gain grammatical functions related to aspect (e.g., continuous,
  perfective). Thus, {ていた} signifies an action "being in progress" or a state "being in existence" during
  a past timeframe.
writeup: |-
  The {ていた} form is a fundamental aspectual expression in Japanese, indicating actions or states that were ongoing, habitual, or resulted in a state in the past. It is essentially the past tense of the {ている} form, carrying over its various nuances but placing them firmly in the past.

  **Progressive Action (Past Continuous)**
  One of the primary uses of {ていた} is to describe an action that was in progress at a particular time in the past. This is analogous to the English "was/were -ing."

  **Resultant State**
  Similar to {ている}, {ていた} can describe a state that resulted from a past action and continued to exist at a certain point in the past. For example, if someone put on a hat (帽子をかぶる) in the past, and at a later past time they were still wearing it, you would use 帽子をかぶっていた.

  **Habitual or Repeated Actions in the Past**
  {ていた} can also be used to describe actions that were done repeatedly or habitually in the past. This is similar to "used to do" or "would do" in English. For instance, 子供の時、毎日公園で遊んでいた (When I was a child, I used to play in the park every day).

  Understanding these distinctions is crucial for accurately describing past events and conditions in Japanese.

  - term: Verb[た] (past tense)
    meaning: describes a completed action in the past.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While {ていた} indicates an action in progress or a state that was ongoing in the past, Verb[た]
      describes a completed action at a specific point in the past. For example, 「本を読んでいた」 (was reading
      a book) versus 「本を読んだ」 (read a book).
    grammar_point: Verb[た] (past tense)
  - term: Verb[た]ことがある (experience of having done)
    meaning: indicates having done something as an experience at some point in the past.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: '{ていた} focuses on the continuity or state in the past, whereas Verb[た]ことがある emphasizes the
      experience of having done something at least once, without necessarily implying ongoing action at
      that time. For example, 「富士山に登っていた」 (was climbing Mt. Fuji) versus 「富士山に登ったことがある」 (have climbed
      Mt. Fuji).'
    grammar_point: '[Verb-た]ことがある (experience of having done)'
  - term: Verb[ている・てる] (progressive・resultative)
    meaning: describes an action currently in progress or a state that currently exists.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '{ていた} is the past tense form of Verb[ている]. If Verb[ている] denotes a present ongoing action
      or current state, then {ていた} describes that same action or state as it was occurring or existing
      in the past.'
    grammar_point: Verb[ている・てる] (progressive・resultative)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between these forms, remember that {ていた} specifically
  places the ongoing action or state in the past, focusing on its duration or continuous nature. Verb[た]
  simply states that an action occurred and was completed. Verb[た]ことがある refers to the *experience* of
  having done something at some point. Finally, Verb[ている] is the present counterpart, describing current
  ongoing actions or states.
examples:
  - english: She was singing when I entered the room.
    japanese:
      - 私 が 部屋 に 入っ た 時、彼女 は 歌っ{て い た}。
      - 部屋 に 入っ たら、彼女 が 歌っ{て い まし た}。
      - 部屋 に 入っ た とき、彼女 は 歌っ{て い た} の よ。
    english_literally: When I entered the room, she was singing.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 が 部屋 に 入っ た 時、彼女 は 歌っ た。
        english: When I entered the room, she sang.
        hint: This suggests she *started* singing right when you entered or completed a song. We're looking
          for an action that was *already in progress*.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 が 部屋 に 入っ た 時、彼女 は 歌 を 歌う ところ だっ た。
        english: When I entered the room, she was about to sing a song.
        hint: This indicates an action that was on the verge of happening, not an action already in progress.
          We're looking for a continuous past action.
    scene: You are recalling a moment from the past.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    nuance: This sentence describes an action that was in progress at a specific point in the past. The
      Japanese 「歌っていた」 clearly shows the continuous nature of her singing at the moment you entered the
      room.

    japanese:
      - 彼 は 昨日、赤い 帽子 を かぶっ {て い た}。

          - 彼 は 昨日、赤い 帽子 を かぶっ た。
        english: He put on a red hat yesterday.
        hint: This implies the *action* of putting on the hat was completed yesterday, not necessarily
          that he *was wearing* it. We're looking for a continuous state.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 昨日、赤い 帽子 を かぶる 予定 だっ た。
        english: He was supposed to wear a red hat yesterday.
        hint: This indicates a plan or expectation, not a state of being. We're looking for a continuous
          state in the past.
    scene: You are describing someone's appearance yesterday.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    nuance: 'Here, 「かぶっていた」 indicates a resultant state: he put on the hat at some point before yesterday,
      and the state of ''wearing the hat'' continued through yesterday. This differs from simply saying
      he ''put on'' the hat.'

          better conveys the habitual nature over a period.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 の 時、毎日 サッカー を する こと に なっ て い た。
        english: When I was a child, it was decided that I would play soccer every day.

          We're looking for a past habit.
    scene: You are reminiscing about your childhood.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    nuance: The phrase 「毎日 サッカー を していた」 clearly conveys a habitual action that occurred regularly throughout
      the past, rather than a single completed instance. This is a common use of {ていた} for describing
      past routines.

    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    nuance: 「眠っていた」 implies the cat was in the continuous state of sleeping at that time in the past.
      It sets a serene, static scene, showing the ongoing nature of the action.

          - ず っと あなた を 待つ べき だっ た。
        english: I should have waited for you for a long time.

          looking for a past continuous action.

    register: formal
    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    nuance: The inclusion of 「ずっと」 (for a long time) emphasizes the duration of the waiting, and 「待っていた」
      is perfectly suited to convey this continuous action in the past. The です makes it polite.

        english: The rain will probably fall heavily all night.

    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    nuance: 「降っていた」 indicates the continuous action of rain falling throughout the night. 「一晩中」 (all night)
      further emphasizes the duration of this past continuous action.
post_example_writeup: These examples illustrate the versatility of {ていた} in describing past actions and
  states. Pay close attention to the context to determine whether it implies progressive action, a resultant
  state, or a habitual past event. The presence of time expressions like 「ずっと」 (all along/for a long time),
  「毎日」 (every day), or 「一晩中」 (all night) often reinforces the continuous or habitual nature of the action.
