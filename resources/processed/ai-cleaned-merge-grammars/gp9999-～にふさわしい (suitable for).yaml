etymology: The word ふさわしい (fusawashii) derives from the classical Japanese verb 釣り合ふ (tsuri-au), which
  meant 'to be balanced' or 'to be in harmony.' This etymological root explains why ふさわしい conveys a sense
  of inherent balance, harmony, and ideal fittingness, extending beyond mere practicality to encompass
  qualities like dignity or appropriateness to a high standard.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point ～にふさわしい is an い-adjective used to express that something is **suitable**, **appropriate**, **fitting**, or **worthy** of a particular noun, situation, or role. It carries a nuance of inherent compatibility and often suggests that the subject meets a certain standard or expectation.

  While it can sometimes be translated simply as "suitable for," it often implies a deeper sense of being *ideally* suited or *deserving* of something. For instance, if you say 「彼 は 社長 に ふさわしい 人 だ」 (Kare wa shachō ni fusawashii hito da), you're not just saying he's suitable, but that he has the qualities, character, and dignity that make him an excellent fit for a company president.

  This expression is generally used in semi-formal to formal contexts. While it's not exclusively formal, it lends a certain gravity to the statement. It's less about a practical or physical fit and more about a conceptual or qualitative match.

  When using ～にふさわしい, the noun or nominalized phrase preceding 「に」 typically represents the standard, role, or situation that the subject is being evaluated against. The subject itself (the thing that is suitable) is usually marked by が, or is the topic of the sentence.

  - term: ～に合う (to fit, to match)
    meaning: to fit, to match, to be suitable for (general)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～に合う」is a more general term for matching or fitting. It can describe physical compatibility
      (e.g., clothes fitting) or general suitability without the strong nuance of inherent worthiness
      or high standards. For instance, 「この 靴 は 私 の 足 に {合う}」 (Kono kutsu wa watashi no ashi ni au) means
      'These shoes fit my feet.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:～に合う (to fit)
  - term: ～に似合う (to suit, to look good on)
    meaning: to suit, to look good on (appearance)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～に似合う」 specifically relates to appearance or style, meaning something looks good on someone
      or suits them aesthetically. It doesn't imply inherent suitability for a role or high standards.
      For example, 「その服 は 君 に {似合う} よ」 (Sono fuku wa kimi ni niau yo) means 'Those clothes look good on
      you.''
    grammar_point: <suggest>:～に似合う (to suit)
  - term: ～に適する (tekisuru - to be suitable, appropriate)
    meaning: to be suitable, appropriate (objective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～に適する」often implies a more objective or practical suitability for a specific purpose or condition.
      It's about being technically or functionally appropriate, whereas 「～にふさわしい」 often carries a more
      qualitative, often higher, standard of appropriateness. For instance, 「この 土地 は 農業 に {適している}」 (Kono
      tochi wa nōgyō ni tekishiteiru) means 'This land is suitable for agriculture.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:～に適する (to be suitable)
  - term: ～にかなう (to meet expectations, to be suitable)
    meaning: to meet expectations, to be suitable, to be in accordance with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～にかなう」 means to meet or fulfill certain expectations, conditions, or standards. It focuses
      on adherence to a criterion rather than inherent suitability or worthiness. For example, 「彼 は 私
      の 期待 に {かなう}」 (Kare wa watashi の kitai に kanau) means 'He meets my expectations.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:～にかなう (to meet expectations)
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions relate to 'suitability,' understanding their distinct
  nuances is crucial. 「～にふさわしい」 emphasizes a deep, often qualitative, compatibility with a role, standard,
  or expectation. It's about inherent worthiness. In contrast, 「～に合う」 is a more general fit, 「～に似合う」 is
  about aesthetic suitability, and 「～に適する」 focuses on objective, practical appropriateness. 「～にかなう」 is
  about meeting a specific criterion or expectation.

  the idea of an ideal or inherent match, often tied to a qualitative standard or role. It is frequently
  used when discussing qualities, attitudes, or environments that perfectly align with a given context.
