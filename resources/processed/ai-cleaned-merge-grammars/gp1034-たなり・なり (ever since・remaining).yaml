meaning: Ever since; While remaining in the state of
pronunciation:
  katakana: タナリ・ナリ
  romaji: tanari / nari
formation:
  Verb[た-form] + なり (で): Indicates that an action or state continues without change after the initial
    verb.
  Verb[た-form] + なりの + Noun: Describes a noun that maintains a certain state or posture following an action,
    typically implying it has been left in that condition or continues that way. (Less common)
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: formal
  nuance: This pattern often implies that the continuation of the state or action is unexpected, undesirable,
    or simply a persistent result of the initial action, often suggesting negligence or lack of follow-up.
    It can also describe simply maintaining a physical posture. The use of (で) after なり is optional but
    can sometimes emphasize the persistent state. The less common なりの + [Noun] pattern describes a noun
    that is left in or maintains the state of the preceding verb's action, e.g., 「座ったなりの姿勢」 (a seated
    posture that is maintained).
etymology: The なり in this construction is thought to derive from the noun 形 (katachi), meaning 'shape'
  or 'form'. This etymology highlights the idea that something remains in the same 'shape' or state as
  when the initial action occurred, emphasizing an unchanging or persistent condition.
writeup: The construction 「～たなり」, used after the past-tense (た-form) of a verb, indicates that a particular
  state or action persists uninterruptedly from the moment the initial verb's action was completed. It
  carries a nuance similar to 「～まま」, but often implies a more abrupt or unexpected continuation, frequently
  with an underlying sense of neglect, abandonment, or an undesirable persistence. This pattern describes
  a direct consequence of an action that continues without change. For instance, if someone 'left (出た)
  and never returned', the 'never returning' is a continuous state directly stemming from the 'leaving'.
  While it can describe simple continuation, it frequently carries a negative or lamentable implication,
  suggesting that things have been left as they are, often to a detrimental effect. When 「～たなり」 is used
  to describe a physical posture or state, it highlights the maintenance of that position or condition
  after an action has been performed. For example, 「座ったなり」 describes someone remaining seated or staying
  in a seated posture. It is important to distinguish this 「なり」 from the classic copula 「なり」 or the 「～なり～なり」
  meaning 'either A or B'. This 「なり」 specifically functions as a conjunction, connecting the initial action
  to its persistent aftermath. The optional inclusion of 「で」 after 「なり」 can sometimes add emphasis to
  the continuous state.
false_friends:
  - term: まま
    meaning: As is; Just as it is; While remaining
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「～たなり」 focuses on the unaltered continuation of a state after an action, often implying
      neglect or an unexpected outcome, 「まま」 can simply describe something being left in its current state,
      whether intentional or not. 「まま」 is broader and less emphasizes the consequence of a preceding action
      remaining unchanged. For example, 「開けっ放しのまま」 (left wide open) focuses on the state itself, whereas
      「開けたなり」 (left open after opening it) stresses the action leading to the state and its persistence.
    grammar_point: まま (as is)
  - term: きり
    meaning: Only; Just; Since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～きり」 typically emphasizes exclusivity ('only' or 'just') or a definitive end to an action,
      after which something ceases. When used in a temporal sense, like 「～てきり」, it emphasizes that an
      action occurred once and has not been repeated since. For example, 「一度会ったきり」 (met only once). In
      contrast, 「～たなり」 emphasizes the continuation of a state that resulted from the action, rather than
      the action itself being singular or the last. It's about what persists, not what stopped or was
      limited to a single occurrence.
    grammar_point: きり (only・since)
  - term: 以来
    meaning: Since then; Hereafter
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「以来」 is a more general term indicating 'since' a particular point in time or event. It simply
      marks the starting point of a period. 「～たなり」, however, specifically highlights that a state or action
      has persisted without change from that point forward, often with the implication of neglect or an
      undesirable outcome. For instance, 「卒業以来連絡がない」 (no contact since graduation) is general, while 「卒業したなり連絡がない」
      (no contact ever since graduating) emphasizes the continued lack of contact as a direct and uninterrupted
      result of graduating.
    grammar_point: 以来 (since・ever since)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「まま」, 「きり」, and 「以来」 can sometimes appear in contexts similar to 「～たなり」,
  each carries a distinct nuance. 「まま」 broadly describes something remaining as it is. 「きり」 emphasizes
  a singular occurrence or a cessation of action from a certain point. 「以来」 simply marks a temporal starting
  point for a period. In contrast, 「～たなり」 specifically conveys that a state or action has persisted without
  interruption since a prior event, often with a subtle implication of neglect or an unintended, continuous
  consequence. Understanding these subtle differences is key to mastering their usage.
examples:
  - english: Ever since he left home this morning, there hasn't been a single word from him.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 朝 家 を 出 た {なり}、一言 も 連絡 が ない。
      - 彼 は 朝 家 を 出 た {なり で}、一言 も 連絡 が ない。
    english_literally: As for him, having left home in the morning, not even a single word of contact
      exists.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 朝 家 を 出 た {まま}、一言 も 連絡 が ない。
        english: He left home this morning, and he remains without a single word of contact.
        hint: 「まま (as is)」 describes a state that continues as it is, without necessarily implying a persistent,
          uninterrupted state directly from the action like 「～たなり」. We're looking for a grammar point
          that stresses the continuous and uninterrupted absence of contact directly from the action of
          leaving.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 朝 家 を 出 た {きり}、一言 も 連絡 が ない。
        english: He left home this morning and that was the last time we heard from him; he hasn't contacted
          us since.
        hint: 「～きり (only, since)」 emphasizes that an action happened once and has not been repeated since.
          We're looking for a phrase that means the lack of contact has been continuous and persistent
          since he left, not just that he hasn't contacted since then.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 朝 家 を 出 て {以来}、一言 も 連絡 が ない。
        english: Since he left home this morning, he hasn't contacted us even once.
        hint: 「以来 (since, ever since)」 indicates 'since that time'. We're looking for a grammar point
          that shows the immediate transition and continuous nature of the action that followed.

    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「連絡 が ない」 (no contact) indicates a lack of communication. The use of 「～たなり」 emphasizes
      the continuous absence of contact directly following the action of leaving home, implying a worrying
      and uninterrupted state of silence. The phrase 「一言 も」 (not a single word) intensifies the concern,
      making the lack of contact absolute. This reflects a mother's deep worry for her child, common for
      older female speakers in casual settings speaking to friends.
    etymology: The phrase 「連絡 が ない」 implies a lack of communication or contact, highlighting an absence
      rather than a presence. 「一言 も」 (ichigon mo) means 'not even a single word', intensifying the sense
      of absolute silence or absence of communication. It literally combines 「一」 (ichi, one) and 「言」 (gon,
      word).

        english: She suddenly started running, and in that state, she turned the corner without looking
          back.
        hint: 「まま (as is)」 focuses on the state during the action. 「～たなり」 emphasizes the immediate, uninterrupted
          continuation of the subsequent action after the initial one. We're looking for the sense of
          immediately and continuously doing the next thing after starting to run.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 急 に 走り 出し た {きり}、振り返る こと なく 角 を 曲がっ た。
        english: After she suddenly started running, she exclusively turned the corner without looking
          back.
        hint: 「～きり (only, since)」 implies exclusivity or a finality, or that nothing else happened afterwards.
          We're looking for a grammar point that signifies the immediate and uninterrupted continuation
          of the action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 急 に 走り 出し て {以来}、振り返る こと なく 角 を 曲がっ た。
        english: Since she suddenly started running, she has turned the corner without looking back.
        hint: 「以来 (since, ever since)」 indicates 'since that time'. We're looking for a grammar point
          that shows the immediate transition and continuous nature of the action that followed.
    scene: A police officer describes a suspect's sudden escape during an investigation.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The structure 「走り出したなり」 highlights the immediate and uninterrupted nature of her actions after
      she began running. The continuous state of 'not looking back' is directly tied to the onset of running,
      suggesting a determined escape. This conveys a sense of rapid, decisive action from a formal perspective,
      typical for police reports.
    etymology: 「走り出す」 (hashiridasu) combines 走る (hashiru, to run) and 出す (dasu, to begin), meaning 'to
      start running'. The auxiliary verb-like use of '出す' for inception is common in Japanese. 「振り返る」
      (furikaeru) means 'to look back' or 'turn around'. The auxiliary 「こと なく」 attached to a verb's dictionary
      form expresses 'without doing X', emphasizing that the action (looking back) did not occur at all
      in this continuous flow of events, and is often used in formal or literary contexts to describe
      a seamless, uninterrupted action sequence where a usual pause or counter-action is absent, contributing
      to the sense of determination or urgency.
  - english: I have many books that I bought and left unread.
    japanese:
      - 買っ た {なり} 読ま ず に 置い て ある 本 が たくさん ある。

          - 買っ た {まま} 読ま ず に 置い て ある 本 が たくさん ある。
        english: I have many books that I bought and left as they are, unread.
        hint: 「まま (as is)」 is a broader expression for 'as is', not specifically emphasizing the continuous
          and unbroken state after the purchase like 「～たなり」. We're looking for a grammar point that conveys
          the books have remained unread ever since they were bought.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 買っ た {きり} 読ま ず に 置い て ある 本 が たくさん ある。
        english: I have many books that I only bought, and then left unread.
        hint: 「～きり (only, since)」 emphasizes a singular action or a limit. We want to convey that the
          state of being unread has persisted continuously since the purchase, not just that buying was
          the only action.
    scene: A student expresses their struggle with time management to their study group.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「買ったなり」 indicates that the state of being unread (読まずに置いてある) has persisted continuously since
      the act of buying. It implies a sense of neglect or procrastination, a common sentiment among younger
      students. The use of 「たくさんある」 (there are many) emphasizes the scale of the unread books, highlighting
      the speaker's habit. The casual tone and topic are typical for a male student among peers.
    etymology: 「読まずに置いてある」 (yomazu ni oite aru) literally means 'are left without being read'. 「読まずに」
      is the negative te-form of 読む (yomu, to read) plus に, indicating 'without reading'. 「置いてある」 (oite
      aru) is the te-form of 置く (oku, to put/place) + ある, indicating a resultant state of something having
      been placed or left in a certain condition. This construction effectively conveys neglect and a
      continuous state of being unread.

    japanese:

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 椅子 に 腰かけ た {まま}、ずっと 沈黙 し て い た。
        english: He sat down in the chair and remained silent in that state.
        hint: 「まま (as is)」 describes maintaining a state. 「～たなり」 emphasizes the unbroken continuation
          of silence from the moment he sat down. We're looking for a phrase that captures the immediate
          and continuous nature of the silence after sitting.
    scene: A detective observes a quiet suspect during an interrogation.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「腰かけたなり」 signifies that he maintained a seated posture, and the state of silence 「沈黙 していた」
      continued without interruption from that moment. This use of 「～たなり」 emphasizes the unchanging, persistent
      nature of his silence, suggesting deep thought or defiance. The formality of the setting and the
      deliberate silence fit the serious tone of an interrogation.
    etymology: 「腰かける」 (koshikakeru) means 'to sit down' or 'take a seat'. It is often used for a more
      temporary sitting than 「座る」 (suwaru). 「沈黙」 (chinmoku) means 'silence' or 'being silent', and 「沈黙
      していた」 (chinmoku shite ita) means 'was silent' or 'remained silent'. The repetition of 「ずっと」 (zutto,
      continuously/all the time) reinforces the persistent nature of the silence after the initial action
      of sitting down.
  - english: Ever since she entered university, she hasn't returned to her parents' home even once.
    japanese:

        english: She entered university and has remained in a state where she stopped laughing like she
          used to.
        hint: 「まま (as is)」 means 'as is' or 'in that state'. 「～たなり」 specifically emphasizes the continuous
          absence of return from the moment she entered university.
    scene: Friends catching up and discussing a mutual friend who moved away for university.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「大学 に 入ったなり」 highlights the continuous state of 'not returning home' since she started university.
      This often implies a significant life change and a persistent separation. The use of 「一度 も」 (not
      even once) emphasizes the absolute lack of return, typical for informal conversation between friends
      discussing someone's life changes. This kind of observation is common among younger female speakers.
    etymology: 「実家」 (jikka) specifically refers to one's parents' home or childhood home, distinct from
      just 'home' (家 ie). 「一度 も」 (ichido mo) means 'not even once', emphasizing the absolute lack of the
      action. This phrase is commonly used to express a complete absence of an expected or desired action
      since a certain point in time, aligning perfectly with the persistent lack of return conveyed by
      「～たなり」.
  - english: The cat slept by the window and didn't move all day.
    japanese:

        english: The cat slept by the window and remained in that sleeping state all day, not moving.
        hint: 「まま (as is)」 focuses on the current state. 「～たなり」 emphasizes the continuous lack of movement
          from the moment it fell asleep.
    scene: Someone observing their lazy pet on a quiet afternoon.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「寝たなり」 describes the cat's state of remaining asleep and motionless after lying down to sleep.
      The phrase 「一日中 動かなかった」 (didn't move all day) reinforces the continuous nature of its inactivity.
      This casual observation is common in personal settings, simply noting a persistent state.
    etymology: 「窓辺」 (madobe) means 'by the window' or 'windowsill', combining 窓 (mado, window) and 辺 (be,
      vicinity). 「一日中」 (ichinichijū) means 'all day long' or 'throughout the day', combining 「一日」 (ichinichi,
      one day) and 「中」 (jū, throughout). This is a common adverbial phrase that, when combined with a
      negative verb, emphasizes a complete lack of action over an entire day, reinforcing the static state
      implied by 「～たなり」.
  - english: The key was left sticking in the door, just as it was, which worried me.
    japanese:
      - 鍵 は ドア に 刺さっ た {なり} 置い て あっ た の で、心配 だっ た。
      - 鍵 は ドア に 刺さっ た {なり で} 置い て あっ た の で、心配 だっ た。

      was worried.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 鍵 は ドア に 刺さっ た {まま} 置い て あっ た の で、心配 だっ た。
        english: The key was left sticking in the door as it was, so I was worried.
        hint: 「まま (as is)」 describes a state 'as is'. 「～たなり」 highlights that the state of the key remaining
          in the door is a direct and uninterrupted result of the action of being stuck, often with a
          nuance of carelessness.
    scene: A person explains to their roommate why they were concerned about security.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    nuance: 「刺さったなり」 indicates that the key remained in the door after being inserted, implying that it
      was left carelessly. The phrase 「置いてあった」 emphasizes the resulting state of neglect. This expression
      is used to convey a state of affairs that has persisted due to someone's action (or inaction), causing
      concern.
    etymology: 「刺さる」 (sasarun) is the intransitive verb meaning 'to stick into' or 'be lodged in'. The
      passive implication of something being 'left' in a state is typical for 「～たなり」 constructions regarding
      objects. The phrase 「心配 だっ た」 (shinpai datta) means 'was worried'. The entire structure 「～たなり 置いてあったので、心配だった」
      clearly establishes a cause-and-effect where the continuous state of the key being stuck (and thus
      neglected) directly led to the speaker's worry.
  - english: Ever since my grandfather returned from the war, he stopped laughing like he used to.

        english: My grandfather returned from the war and remained in a state where he stopped laughing
          like he used to.
        hint: 「まま (as is)」 describes a general state. 「～たなり」 emphasizes the immediate and continuous change
          in his behavior from the moment he returned.
    scene: A grandchild reflects on the lasting impact of war on their grandfather's demeanor.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「帰ってきたなり」 conveys that the change in his grandfather's behavior (stopped laughing) was immediate
      and persistent from the moment he returned. It implies a profound and continuous emotional shift.
      The phrase 「以前のように笑うことがなくなった」 (stopped laughing like before) highlights the drastic and enduring
      change in his personality. This reflective, melancholic tone is often conveyed by younger speakers
      contemplating serious historical impacts, such as war, on older family members.
    etymology: 「以前 の よう に」 (izen no yō ni) means 'as before' or 'as in the past'. The phrase 「笑う こと が
      なくなった」 (warau koto ga naku natta) means 'stopped being able to laugh' or 'stopped laughing'. This
      highlights a significant and lasting change in the grandfather's emotional expression and overall
      demeanor, a profound consequence of the war.
  - english: He fell asleep as soon as he lay down, and didn't even move an inch.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 横 に なっ た {なり}、微動 だに し なかっ た。

          - 彼 は 横 に なっ た {まま}、微動 だに し なかっ た。
        english: He fell asleep in the posture he lay down in, and didn't even move an inch.
        hint: 「まま (as is)」 describes a state 'as is'. 「～たなりの姿勢で」 specifically emphasizes that the posture
          assumed upon lying down was the one continuously maintained.
    scene: A parent observing their child, who is exhausted after a long day.
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    nuance: The phrase 「微動 だに しなかった」 (didn't move an inch) reinforces the unwavering persistence of no
      movement. The use of 「横 に なった {なり}」 or 「横 に なった {なり で}」 indicates the immediate and continuous lack
      of movement from the moment he lay down. Furthermore, 「横 に なった {なり} の 姿勢 で」 specifically emphasizes
      that the posture assumed upon lying down was maintained continuously. This highlights the child's
      deep exhaustion, evoking sympathy from a parent.
    etymology: 「微動 だに しなかった」 (bidō dani shinakatta) is a strong negative expression meaning 'didn't move
      even a twitch'. 「微動」 (bidō) means 'slight movement', and 「だに」 (dani) is an old particle that emphasizes
      'even' or 'not even'. The phrase effectively highlights the absolute stillness following the act
      of lying down, reinforcing the continuous state of non-movement.
  - english: The old car sat in the garage, covered in dust, just as it had been left years ago.
    japanese:
      - 古い 車 は 置い た {なり} の 状態 で、何 年 も 埃 を かぶっ て ガレージ に あっ た。
      - 古い 車 は 置い た {なり で} 何 年 も 埃 を かぶっ て ガレージ に あっ た。

        english: The old car sat in the garage, covered in dust, just as it was, as it had been left years
          ago.
        hint: 「まま (as is)」 describes a state 'as is'. 「～たなりの状態」 specifically emphasizes that the car remained
          in the exact neglected condition it was left in, implying continuous disuse. We're looking for
          a grammar point emphasizing the persistence of the original state of being left.
    scene: Someone describing an abandoned object in a garage.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「置いたなりの状態」 highlights that the car remained in the exact neglected condition it was left in,
      emphasizing its continuous disuse and the passage of time. The optional 「なりで」 further stresses the
      manner in which it remained.
    etymology: 「埃 を かぶる」 (hokori o kaburu) literally means 'to wear dust' or 'to be covered in dust',
      a common expression for something that has been left untouched and accumulated dust. 「何 年 も」 (nannen
      mo) means 'for many years', with 「も」 emphasizing the surprising or significant duration. This expression
      is particularly effective in conjunction with 「～たなり」 to convey a long-standing state of neglect
      or disuse of an object.
post_example_writeup: The usage of 「～たなり」 can be very effective in conveying a sense of unchanging state
  or an unexpected, persistent consequence. While it often implies a negative or regrettable outcome,
