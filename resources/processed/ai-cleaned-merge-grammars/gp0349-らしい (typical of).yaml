    "etymology": "The origin of らしい is debated, but it is believed to be derived from the verb 知る (shiru, \"to know\"), suggesting that something is perceived or understood to be a certain way based on knowledge or experience. Over time, it evolved to express typicality or resemblance to a known characteristic.",
    "writeup": "**らしい** is used to express that something is \"typical of\" or \"befitting\" a certain noun. It behaves like an *i*-adjective, conjugating accordingly (e.g., らしかった, らしくない). It indicates that something possesses features or traits expected of it. This can apply to people (e.g., \"studying all night is so typical of Tanaka\") or things (e.g., \"this heat is so typical of the Japanese summer\"). It can also express something is uncharacteristic, implying surprise. When the same noun appears before and after らしい, it emphasizes that the first noun is the prime example of the second.",
