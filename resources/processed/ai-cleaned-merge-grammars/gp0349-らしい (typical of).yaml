    "etymology": "「らしい」 comes from the verb 「似る (にる)」, meaning \"to resemble\" or \"to be similar to\". The suffix 「〜しい」 is added to express a stronger degree of similarity, conveying the sense of something being very much like or typical of something else.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「らしい」, is used as an auxiliary adjective, meaning it must be attached to a noun to have meaning. It indicates that something is \"typical of,\" \"-ish,\" or \"like\" the noun it modifies. Think of it as describing something that possesses qualities or characteristics that are expected or associated with that noun.\n\n*   It can be used for people, such as saying 「田中さんらしい」 (typical of Tanaka).\n*   It can be used for things, like saying 「夏らしい」 (summery).\n*   It can also be used negatively with 「らしくない」 to express that something is uncharacteristic.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   When the noun is repeated, such as 「夏らしい夏」, it emphasizes that something is the prime example of that noun (e.g., \"the most summery summer\").",
