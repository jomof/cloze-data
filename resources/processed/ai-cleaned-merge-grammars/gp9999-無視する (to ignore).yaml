jlpt: N3
etymology: 'The verb 「無視する」is composed of two kanji: 無 (mu), meaning ''nothing'' or ''not'', and 視 (shi),
  meaning ''to see'' or ''to look''. Thus, its literal meaning is ''to not see'' or ''to not look at''.
  Over time, this evolved to mean ''to intentionally disregard'' or ''to ignore'', emphasizing a deliberate
  act of not acknowledging something''s presence or importance, similar to how one might purposefully
  avert their gaze.'
writeup: |-
  「無視する」 expresses the act of **intentionally** not paying attention to something or someone. This can range from deliberately not responding to a call or message, to consciously disregarding a rule, advice, or even another person's presence. The key element is the *conscious choice* to disregard. It often carries a connotation of **deliberate oversight, disrespect, or evasion**. It is not typically used for unintentional oversight or simply being unaware.

  For example, if someone calls your name and you pretend not to hear them, you are 「無視している」. If you deliberately break a rule, you are 「ルールを無視している」. This grammar point can be applied to people, objects, rules, facts, or situations where one chooses to act as if they do not exist or are not important. It is a versatile verb and can be used in both formal and casual contexts depending on the conjugation. While it can be used neutrally to describe the act of ignoring, it often implies a negative judgment from the speaker, especially when it concerns ignoring people or important warnings.

  - term: 見過ごす (to overlook)
    meaning: to overlook, to miss, to let pass without noticing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「見過ごす」 implies an unintentional oversight or a deliberate decision to let something pass without
      intervention, often because it's deemed minor or not worth addressing. Unlike 「無視する」, it doesn't
      necessarily involve a deliberate act of *disregarding* what is seen or heard, but rather a failure
      to properly *perceive* or *act upon* it.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:見過ごす (to overlook)
  - term: 気づかない (not to notice)
    meaning: not to notice, to be unaware of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「気づかない」 refers to a complete lack of awareness or perception. It's about genuinely not realizing
      something, rather than intentionally ignoring it. The action is passive and unintentional, whereas
      「無視する」 is active and intentional.
    grammar_point: に気がつく (to notice・realize)
  - term: 聞き流す (to pay no attention to)
    meaning: to let something go in one ear and out the other, to pay no attention to (what one hears)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「聞き流す」 involves deliberately disregarding something, it specifically applies to **spoken
      words or sounds**. The nuance is often about consciously choosing *not* to take something seriously
      or to let it pass without internalizing it, perhaps because it's trivial, annoying, or untrue. 「無視する」
      has a broader scope, applying to people, rules, situations, and not just auditory input.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:聞き流す (to pay no attention to)
  - term: 気にしない (to not mind)
    meaning: to not mind, to not worry about, to not care
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「気にしない」 means to dismiss something as unimportant or not bothersome, often implying that one
      is emotionally unaffected by it. While it shares the idea of not letting something affect you, it's
      about one's internal emotional state or attitude, not necessarily an overt action of disregard.
      「無視する」 is about the *action* of ignoring, which can stem from not caring, but the focus is on the
      behavior.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:気にしない (to not mind)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate, consider the intention and the type of input. 「無視する」 always
  implies a conscious, active choice to disregard. 「見過ごす」 suggests unintentional oversight or letting
  something pass. 「気づかない」 means a genuine lack of awareness. 「聞き流す」 is specifically about ignoring auditory
  information, often by letting it pass through one's mind without taking it seriously. Lastly, 「気にしない」
  describes an emotional state of not being bothered or concerned by something.

      a deliberate act even if the person is preoccupied.

      in instructions or warnings given to a group, indicating that ignoring others' opinions is an unacceptable

          for the act of pretending to intentionally ignore.
    scene: Someone intentionally avoids eye contact or acknowledgment.

      it was feigned. This example clearly shows the intentional aspect of 「無視する」, as opposed to simply

          looking for the act of trying to make a problem go away by disregarding it.

  choice not to acknowledge or address it. This intentionality is what primarily distinguishes it from
  similar-sounding expressions that might imply unintentional oversight or a lack of awareness.
