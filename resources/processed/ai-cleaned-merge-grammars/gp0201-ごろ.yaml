    "etymology": "The origin of 「ごろ」 is debated, but one theory suggests it comes from 「頃 (koro)」, meaning \"time\" or \"about\". 「ごろ」 softens the exactness of a time, making it approximate, often appearing as a colloquial pronunciation of 「ころ」.",
    "writeup": "「ごろ」, often used interchangeably with 「ころ」 (especially in its kanji form 「頃」), functions to indicate an approximate time or period. It is primarily affixed to nouns that denote time, such as specific hours or broader timeframes like seasons or life stages. \n\nThis grammar point is frequently compared with 「くらい」 (or 「ぐらい」), as both express approximation. However, there are crucial distinctions:\n\n*   **Scope of Use**: While 「ごろ」 is exclusively used for approximations of time, 「くらい」 has a wider application, covering approximations of quantities, distances, or degrees, in addition to time.\n*   **Precision and Span**: 「ごろ」 often conveys a broader, less precise span of time. For example, 「子供の{ごろ}」 (around my childhood) suggests the entire period of one's youth. In contrast, when used with time, 「くらい」 can imply a more focused or \"up to the extent of\" approximation, like 「３時{くらい}」 (around 3 o'clock, suggesting a point close to 3). Think of 「ごろ」 as indicating 'within the span of' a given time, while 「くらい」 is closer to 'at the point of' that time, or 'up to the extent of' it.\n*   **Interchangeability**: For very specific time points (e.g., 3 o'clock), 「ごろ」 and 「くらい」 can often be used interchangeably without a significant difference in meaning. However, for broader or less defined periods (like \"childhood\" or \"the Edo period\"), 「ごろ」 is the more natural and appropriate choice.\n\nIt is important to note that 「ごろ」 is not used for approximating distances or quantities. For instance, you would say 「２メートル{くらい}」 (around 2 meters), not 「２メートル{ごろ}」.",
