    "etymology": "The etymology of 「ごろ」 is not definitively known, but it is believed to be related to the idea of rounding or approximating a quantity. It is thought to have evolved from earlier words with similar meanings of vague quantity or nearness. The kanji 「頃」, when used, reinforces the sense of a period or time frame.",
    "writeup": "「ごろ」 means \"around\" or \"about\" when referring to time. It's similar to 「くらい」 but implies a broader range or span of time, whereas 「くらい」 suggests a more specific estimate. 「ごろ」 attaches to nouns indicating time. It expresses a span, while 「くらい」 expresses an extent.\n\n*   「ごろ」 is used for approximate times (e.g., 「11時ごろ」 \"around 11 o'clock\").\n*   「くらい」 is more suited for approximate amounts or degrees (e.g., 「２メートルくらい」 \"about 2 meters\").\n*   The kanji form 「頃」 is also common.",
