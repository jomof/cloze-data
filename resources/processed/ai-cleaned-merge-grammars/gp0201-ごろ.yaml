    "etymology": "The origin of 「ごろ」 is debated, but one theory suggests it comes from 「頃 (koro)」, meaning \"time\" or \"about\". 「ごろ」 softens the exactness of a time, making it approximate.",
    "writeup": "「ごろ」 indicates an approximate time, similar to 「くらい」, but with some key differences. 「ごろ」 is attached to the end of a noun (usually indicating time) or a noun followed by 「の」. It expresses a broader, less specific timeframe compared to 「くらい」.  While 「くらい」 can be used for approximate distances or lengths, 「ごろ」 is generally not used in that context. Think of 「ごろ」 as indicating a span of time, while 「くらい」 indicates an extent or degree. The kanji form 「頃」 is also common, so it's useful to learn it.",
