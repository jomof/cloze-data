grammar_point: 〜の上で (on the basis of)
learn_before:
  - Verb[た] (past tense)
  - てから (after and since)
id: gp9999
meaning: On the basis of; after carefully considering or completing X, then doing Y
pronunciation:
  katakana: ウエデ
  romaji: ue de
formation:
  Verb[た形] + 上で: Indicates that the action in the main clause is performed after and based on the completion
    of the preceding verb's action.
  Noun + の + 上で: Indicates that the action in the main clause is performed after and based on the preceding
    noun (e.g., discussions, examination, consent).
jlpt: N2
etymology: The phrase combines 「上 (ue)」, meaning 'above' or 'on top,' with the particle 「で (de)」, indicating
  location or means. Conceptually, it conveys that the subsequent action is built 'on top of' or 'upon
  the foundation' of the preceding action or deliberation. This extends the concrete spatial sense of
  'above' to an abstract meaning of 'based on' or 'following upon careful consideration.'
writeup: |-
  「〜の上で (〜のうえで)」 is a formal expression used to indicate that an action or decision is made after a preceding action has been completed or after a certain condition or information has been taken into careful consideration. It implies a logical progression where the first step is essential and serves as the basis for the second.

  This grammar point is distinct from simple temporal sequences like 「〜た後で」 or 「〜てから」. While those simply state that one action happens after another, 「〜の上で」 emphasizes that the second action is a direct consequence or is dependent on the thorough completion or consideration of the first. It often appears in contexts where thoroughness, deliberation, or official procedure is important, such as business, legal, or academic settings.

  It is commonly used with verbs in their past tense (た形) or with nouns followed by 「の」. For example, 「よく考えた上で決定する」 (to decide after thinking carefully) or 「話し合いの上で結論を出す」 (to reach a conclusion after discussions). The nuance is that the thinking or discussion is not just a preceding event, but the foundation upon which the decision or conclusion is built.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   It is generally used when the subject of the first and second clauses is the same, or when the first clause describes an impersonal process (like a discussion).
  *   It is more formal than 「〜てから」 or 「〜た後で」 and is often found in written Japanese or formal speeches.

  - term: 〜上で (じょうで)
    meaning: In terms of; from the perspective of; for the sake of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 'While sharing the same kanji, this expression is pronounced 「じょうで」 and has a completely different
      meaning. It refers to a specific aspect or perspective (e.g., 法律上: legally, 仕事上: for work). It does
      not imply a temporal or foundational relationship.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜上で (in terms of)
  - term: 〜た後で
    meaning: After doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜た後で」 simply indicates temporal sequence; one action happens after another. It does not carry
      the nuance of the first action being a necessary basis or careful consideration for the second,
      as 「〜の上で」 does. For instance, 「食べた後で寝る」 (I sleep after eating) is a simple sequence.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜た後で (after doing)
  - term: 〜てから
    meaning: After; since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 'Similar to 「〜た後で」, 「〜てから」 primarily denotes a temporal sequence, often implying that the
      second action begins immediately or shortly after the first is completed. It lacks the strong ''basis''
      or ''consideration'' nuance found in 「〜の上で」. Example: 「宿題をしてから遊びに行った」 (I went to play after doing
      my homework).'
    grammar_point: てから (after and since)
  - term: 〜に基づいて
    meaning: Based on; in accordance with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜に基づいて」 is very close in meaning and can sometimes be interchangeable, but it strongly emphasizes
      that the action is founded upon specific rules, principles, data, or facts. 「〜の上で」 can be based
      on more general consideration or discussion, not necessarily strict rules or data.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜に基づいて (based on)
  - term: 〜てからでないと〜ない
    meaning: Unless one does X, one cannot do Y
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expression denotes a strict prerequisite. It's similar in that the first action is necessary
      for the second, but it carries a negative conditional meaning ('if not A, then not B'), often with
      an implication of impossibility or strong restriction, which 「〜の上で」 does not inherently have.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜てからでないと〜ない (unless after doing)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「〜の上で」 implies a deliberate action taken *after* a preparatory step
  or consideration, expressions like 「〜た後で」 or 「〜てから」 simply state temporal succession. 「〜に基づいて」 often
  refers to basing an action on explicit rules or data, while 「〜の上で」 can be based on more general deliberation.
  Pay close attention to the nuance of 'basis' or 'foundation' inherent in 「〜の上で」 to distinguish it.

        english: We will start construction after the detailed plans are decided.
        hint: 「〜た後で」 simply indicates a temporal sequence, not necessarily that the construction relies
          on the decision as its foundation. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes the prior
          action as a basis.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 詳しい 計画 を 決定 し て から、工事 を 開始 し ます。
        english: We will start construction after deciding the detailed plans.
        hint: 「〜てから」 also indicates a temporal sequence. It doesn't convey the sense of building upon
          the decision as a necessary condition for proceeding with construction. We need something that
          highlights the decision as a foundation.
    scene: A project manager addressing the team.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of 「決定した上で」 emphasizes that the construction will only proceed after the detailed

      typical in professional settings.

        hint: 「〜た後で」 suggests only a chronological order. This sentence implies that understanding the

          looking for emphasis on using the reading as a basis.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: After reading the instructions, please submit your application.
        hint: 「〜てから」 implies a simple sequence. The nuance here is that the application should be based
          on a careful understanding of the instructions, not just that reading happens before applying.
          We're looking for a foundational relationship.
    scene: A notice at a government office or website.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: 「よく読んだ上で」 highlights that simply reading is not enough; the applicant must understand and

        english: I will make a decision after consulting with my family.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 家族 と 相談 し て から、決め ます。
        english: I will make a decision after consulting with my family.
        hint: 「〜てから」 also indicates a simple temporal sequence. This sentence emphasizes that the family's
          input will be integral to the decision-making process. We need an expression for basing the
          decision on the consultation.
    scene: A person explaining their decision-making process.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「相談した上で」 implies that the family's input is a crucial factor in the decision, not just something

        hint: 「〜た後で」 describes a mere sequence. The original sentence implies that confirming safety measures
          was a necessary prerequisite and foundation for proceeding with the experiment. We're looking
          for the idea of 'based on'.

          - 安全 対策 を 確認 し て から、実験 を 進め まし た。
        english: We proceeded with the experiment after confirming the safety measures.
        hint: 「〜てから」 also just indicates a temporal order. The sentence emphasizes that the experiment
          could only proceed because the safety measures were confirmed and acted as a basis. We need
          a stronger connection.
    scene: A scientist reporting on their work.
    register: formal
    setting: academic

          provided the basis for the decision, indicating a more careful and reasoned approach. We're
          looking for the nuance of 'based on'.
    scene: A team leader explaining a strategic choice.
    register: formal
    setting: professional

      making a choice, suggesting a well-thought-out decision rather than a quick one.

        hint: 「〜た後で」 for nouns doesn't quite fit the meaning of 'on the basis of'. This sentence means
          the agreement is the necessary condition and foundation for the contract. We're looking for
          a foundational relationship.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: The contract will be signed based on mutual agreement.
        hint: While 「〜に基づいて」 is very similar, 「〜の上で」 can imply a broader sense of deliberation or mutual
          understanding rather than strictly adherence to a rule or principle, which 「〜に基づいて」 often suggests.
          Here, it's about the agreement being the foundation.
    scene: A legal professional discussing a contract.
    register: formal
    setting: legal
    nuance: Using 「合意の上で」 with a noun (合意 'agreement') signifies that the agreement is the absolute foundational
