    "etymology": "The grammar point derives from the verb 至る (itaru), meaning \"to arrive,\" \"to reach,\" or \"to lead to.\" The に particle indicates the point or situation that is reached, emphasizing that a certain outcome or realization occurs only upon reaching that specific stage.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **に至って** (ni itatte) and its more formal counterpart **に至り** (ni itari) signify that a situation has progressed to an **extreme or critical point**, which then leads to a subsequent event or realization. It often implies that something has been allowed to reach an undesirable state, and action or understanding only occurs at this extreme juncture.\n\nThis structure strongly conveys a sense of **belatedness or a critical turning point**. Consequently, it is frequently employed when criticizing a lack of timely action, suggesting that necessary steps were taken *only after* a situation had become severe.\n\nCommon translations include 'only when (A), did (B) occur,' 'only after (A), (B) occurred,' or 'going as far as to (A), (B).'\n\n**に至り** is the conjunctive (masu-stem) form of the verb **至る** (itaru), and it serves as a more formal or literary alternative to the standard te-form **に至って**. You will typically encounter **に至り** in written contexts, news reports, or formal speeches.\n\n**Important Distinction: に至って vs. に至っても**\n\nWhile grammatically similar, **に至って** and **に至っても** carry opposite meanings. Understanding this difference is crucial:\n\n*   **(A)に至って(B)**: This means 'Only when/after reaching the extreme of (A), did (B) occur.' It implies a consequence or realization *because* (A) reached a critical point.\n*   **(A)に至っても(B)**: This means 'Even if reaching the extreme of (A), (B) won't occur.' It implies a lack of consequence or realization *despite* (A) reaching a critical point. This grammar point is covered separately.",

Think of **に至って** as 'X happened, *then* Y' (Y is a result of X reaching an extreme) and **に至っても** as 'X happened, *still* no Y' (Y doesn't happen despite X reaching an extreme).",
