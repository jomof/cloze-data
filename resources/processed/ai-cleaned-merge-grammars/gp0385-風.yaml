        "usage-context": "Used to describe something that has the characteristics, style, or appearance of a noun.",
        "function": "Indicates resemblance in style, manner, or appearance.",
        "nuance": "Implies an established, recognized style, trend, or characteristic, rather than a mere casual similarity. It can also imply an intentional adoption of that style.",
        "source": "Bunpro, DOJG",
        "counterpoint": "Often contrasted with ～みたい and ～のようだ, which convey more general or subjective similarity.",

        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a noun suffix, modifying another noun or verb."

    "etymology": "The kanji 風 (kaze) originally meant \"wind.\" In this grammatical context, however, it is used metaphorically to describe a style, manner, or way of doing something, like the wind carrying a certain atmosphere or feeling that defines a particular form. This usage has evolved to denote a distinct 'flavor' or characteristic.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 風 (fū) is used in Japanese to convey the meaning of \"in the style of (A)\" or \"in the fashion of (A).\" It implies that something possesses the characteristics, appearance, or general atmosphere of the noun it modifies. While the kanji 風 can mean \"wind\" (kaze), in this compound form, it consistently takes the reading ふう (fū). To use 風, attach it directly to the end of a noun to describe something as being 'in the style of' that noun. For example, 日本風 (Nihon-fū) means 'Japanese-style'. Additionally, the particle の (no) may be attached after 風 (i.e., 風の) before connecting it to another noun. This clarifies that the second noun (B) is in the style of the first noun (A). For example, 日本風の家 (Nihon-fū no ie) means 'a Japanese-style house'. **Important Consideration**: As a compound structure or suffix, 風 is always pronounced ふう (fū) in this grammatical pattern. It is crucial not to confuse it with its common reading かぜ (kaze) when it refers to 'wind' or 'a cold'.",

            "term": "～みたい",
            "meaning": "like, similar to, seems like",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 風, ～みたい is more casual and indicates a general likeness or appearance, rather than a specific 'style' or 'fashion'. It can also express a subjective impression, suggesting that something 'looks like' or 'seems like' something else, without necessarily implying an intentional or established characteristic."
        },

            "term": "～のようだ",
            "meaning": "like, as if, seems like",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Similar to ～みたい but more formal, ～のようだ expresses a likeness or comparison. While 風 denotes an established style or characteristic, ～のようだ often implies a resemblance that might be coincidental or temporary, or a comparison made for descriptive purposes rather than an inherent quality."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When differentiating between 風, ～みたい, and ～のようだ, consider the formality and the nature of the resemblance. 風 is used for recognized styles, fashions, or appearances that have a distinct identity. ～みたい is a casual way to say 'like' or 'seems like', often based on a subjective or transient impression. ～のようだ is its more formal counterpart, also indicating resemblance or appearance but used in more formal contexts and often for more direct comparisons.",
