    "etymology": "The kanji 風 (kaze) originally meant \"wind.\" However, in this grammatical context, it is used metaphorically to describe a style, manner, or way of doing something, like the wind carrying a certain atmosphere or feeling.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 風 (fū) is used in Japanese to convey the meaning of \"in the style of (A)\" or \"in the fashion of (A).\" Literally, this could be interpreted as \"in the wind of (A),\" which captures the nuance of something taking on the characteristics of something else. To use 風, attach it to the end of a noun that you want to label something as being in the 'style' of. の may also be attached to the end of 風, before connecting it to another noun, demonstrating that '(B) is in the style of (A)'. It's **important** to remember that as a compound structure, this suffix is always pronounced ふう (fū), never かぜ (kaze), which is the standard reading of 風 when it means \"wind.\"",
