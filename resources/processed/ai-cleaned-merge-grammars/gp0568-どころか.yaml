    },
    "etymology": "「どころか」 is derived from 「所 (tokoro)」, meaning 'place' or 'situation,' combined with the sentence-ending particle 「か (ka)」. The sound change from 「ところ」 to 「どころ」 is a common phonetic phenomenon (rendaku) seen when 「所」 is used in negative or contrasting contexts. The particle 「か」 can introduce a question or express doubt, contributing to the nuance of \"it's not even remotely (A)\" or \"do you honestly think it's (A)!?\"",
    "writeup": "「どころか」 is a powerful grammatical construction used to express a strong contrast or negation, conveying meanings like \"far from,\" \"anything but,\" or \"let alone.\" It functions by denying the premise of the preceding statement (A) and then emphasizing a contradictory or even more significant truth (B). The speaker uses 「どころか」 to highlight that not only is situation (A) not true, but the reality is often the exact opposite, or something even more extreme.\n\nThis grammar point is versatile and can attach to various parts of speech:\n*   **Verbs in their plain form**: For instance, 「食べるどころか」 (far from eating).\n*   **い-adjectives in their plain form**: For example, 「甘いどころか」 (far from being sweet).\n*   **な-adjectives in their stem form (without な)**: Such as 「元気どころか」 (far from being healthy).\n*   **Nouns**: Like 「プロどころか」 (far from being a professional).\n\nA key characteristic of 「どころか」 is that it always introduces a consequence (B) that is either the complete opposite of the initial statement (A) or represents an even more extreme or unexpected situation. The part (B) is what the speaker wants to emphasize as the true reality. For instance, if someone says 「彼は忙しいどころか、時間がありすぎる」 (Far from him being busy, he has too much time), it strongly refutes the idea of him being busy and highlights the surprising amount of free time he actually has.\n\nThe particle 「か」 at the end adds a subtle nuance, making the phrase similar to questioning the initial premise, as in \"Could it possibly be (A)? No, not at all!\" This rhetorical questioning amplifies the sense of negation and contrast. While it can appear in questions, its more common use is in declarative sentences to assert a contrary reality.",
