    "etymology": "「どころか」 is derived from 「所 (tokoro)」 meaning 'place' or 'situation,' combined with the particle 「か (ka)」, which indicates a question or doubt. The transformation of 「ところ」 to 「どころ」 often occurs in negative contexts.",
    "writeup": "「どころか」 is used to strongly negate a statement and emphasize a contrasting point. It conveys the meaning of \"far from,\" \"let alone,\" or \"anything but.\" The part preceding 「どころか」 (A) is denied or minimized, while the part following it (B) is emphasized as being more important or true. The literal sense is similar to saying, \"it's not even remotely (A).\" 「どころか」 can follow the plain form of verbs and い-adjectives, the stem form of な-adjectives, and nouns. However, the sentence must emphasize some more important information.",
