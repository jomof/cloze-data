formation:

jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General communication, describing audibility.
  function: Describes the passive perception of sound or the impression a sound makes.
  nuance: Emphasizes that a sound is perceivable without active effort or intention to listen. It is about
    what is simply 'there' to be heard.
  grammatical-role: Intransitive verb. The sound source is marked with が (ga).
  temporal-flow: Can describe sounds that are currently audible, have been audible, or will be audible.
  spatial-flow: Can describe sounds heard from a particular location or distance, or within a specific
    area (e.g., 'in this room').
etymology: The verb 「聞こえる」 originally derived from the potential form of 「聞く (kiku)」, meaning "to hear."
  Over time, 「聞こえる」 evolved into an independent intransitive verb, emphasizing the passive reception of
  sound rather than the active act of listening.
writeup: |-
  「聞こえる」 is an intransitive verb that describes sounds that **can be heard** or **the way something sounds**. It emphasizes the audibility of sound without requiring active listening. Thus, it means "to be audible," "can hear," or "to sound like."

  *   When using 「聞こえる」, the sound source is marked with 「が」. For example, 「音楽 が 聞こえる (ongaku ga kikoeru)」 means "I can hear music."
  *   To describe *how* something sounds, use an adverbial modifier. For い-adjectives, change the ending to 「く」; for な-adjectives or nouns, add 「に」. For example, 「声 が 美しく 聞こえる (koe ga utsukushiku kikoeru)」 means "the voice sounds beautiful."

  **Key Difference**: 「聞こえる」 describes sounds that are passively received, while 「聞ける (kikeru)」 (the potential form of 「聞く」) refers to the *ability* to hear when actively trying to listen.
false_friends:
  - term: 聞ける
    meaning: Can hear (when actively listening)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「聞こえる」, 「聞ける」 emphasizes the ability to hear something by actively trying to listen.
      For instance, 「静か な 部屋 に いる と 聞ける よ」 implies that you need to concentrate to hear it, whereas 「静か
      な 部屋 に いる と 聞こえる よ」 suggests that the sound is naturally audible.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:聞ける (can hear - active)
  - term: 聞く
    meaning: To hear; to listen (actively)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike the passive 「聞こえる」, which describes sound being audible, 「聞く」 implies an active effort
      to listen or perceive a sound. For example, 「音楽 を 聞く」 means 'to listen to music'.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:聞く (to hear・listen)
  - term: れる・られる (Potential)
    meaning: To be able to, can
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「聞こえる」 focuses specifically on sounds being audible, 「れる・られる」 indicates a general ability
      to do something. For example, 「食べられる」 means 'can eat,' while 「聞こえる」 means 'can be heard'.
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
  - term: 見える
    meaning: To be visible; can see
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「聞こえる」 refers to audibility, 「見える」 refers to visibility. Both describe passive perception,
      where something is perceivable without active effort, but they apply to different senses.
    grammar_point: 見える (to be visible・to seem)
  - term: '[Adj-stem]・[V-stem]そうだ (looks・seems like)'
    meaning: Seems like; looks like; sounds like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「聞こえる」 directly describes a sound's quality (e.g., 「悲しそうに聞こえる」 vs. 「悲しく聞こえる」), 「そう」
      is a general expression for appearance or seeming, applicable to all senses or information, not
      just sound.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem・Adj-stem]〜そうだ (it seems・looks like)'
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「聞こえる」 with other similar expressions, remember that 「聞こえる」
  refers specifically to the audibility of sound, 「聞ける」 refers to the ability to hear actively, 「れる・られる」
  indicates a general ability, and 「見える」 is its visual counterpart. 「そう」 describes a general appearance,
  which can include how something sounds, but without the direct audibility of 「聞こえる」. Using the correct
  verb depends on the context and what you want to emphasize.

          similar, 「聞こえ ない」 specifically describes the signal as 'inaudible' or not being received by
          the device's 'ear'. We're looking for a verb that describes the signal's audibility/receivability.

        english: If you listen closely, you will be able to hear a faint melody.

          not necessarily an active ability to perceive it.
    scene: You are with a friend in a quiet place, trying to identify a barely audible sound.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「聞こえる だろう」 uses the plain form of 「聞こえる」 combined with 「だろう」 to express an inference or probability
      that the faint melody will become audible if the listener makes an effort to concentrate (`よく 耳
      を 澄ま せ ば`). This gentle encouragement is typical of a younger person instructing peers.
post_example_writeup: Remember that 「聞こえる」 describes the audibility of sounds that can be heard without
  effort, while 「聞ける」 implies the ability to hear when actively trying to listen.
