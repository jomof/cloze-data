    "etymology": "The negative auxiliary 「ない」is derived from the adjective 「無い」 (nai), meaning 'not exist' or 'not have'. Over time, it grammaticalized into an auxiliary verb used to negate other verbs. ません is the polite form of ない, derived from the polite auxiliary verb ます.",
    "writeup": "The negative form of 「る」-verbs are conjugated similarly to other forms of 「る」-verb conjugation. Remove the 「る」, and then add 「ない」 (casual) or 「ません」 (polite).\n\nWhile the common translation of 「ない」 and 「ません」 is simply \"not\", they have several possible nuances, including:\n\n*   \"Don't\" (usually not)\n*   \"Won't\" (intentionally not)\n*   \"Can't\" (unintentionally not)\n\nBoth 「ない」 and 「ません」 are auxiliary verbs (「ません」 is a conjugation of 「ます」), meaning they have their own set of conjugation rules.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nThe 「ない」 attached to make the negative form of adjectives is a *different* word and follows different conjugation rules. When attached to adjectives, 「ない」 is itself an い-adjective and not an auxiliary verb.",
