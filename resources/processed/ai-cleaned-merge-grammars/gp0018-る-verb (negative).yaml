    "etymology": "The negative form of 「る」 verbs is derived by removing the 「る」 ending and adding 「ない」 (casual) or 「ません」 (polite). 「ない」 itself is an い-adjective with its own conjugation rules, and 「ません」 is the negative form of 「ます」.",
    "writeup": "The negative form of る-verbs is created by removing the 「る」 from the dictionary form and adding 「ない」 for the casual form or 「ません」 for the polite form. For example, 「食べる」 (taberu, to eat) becomes 「食べない」 (tabenai, do not eat) or 「食べません」 (tabemasen, will not eat).\n\nWhile 「ない」 and 「ません」 are commonly translated as \"not,\" they can express different nuances, such as \"don't\" (usually not), \"won't\" (intentionally not), or \"can't\" (unintentionally not). Remember that 「ない」, when used to negate a verb, is different from the 「ない」 that's used to negate adjectives. \n\nKey points:\n\n*   **る-verb (dictionary form) - る + ない = Casual negative form**\n*   **る-verb (dictionary form) - る + ません = Polite negative form**",
