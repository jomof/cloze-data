    "etymology": "The negative form of 「る」 verbs is derived by removing the 「る」 ending and adding 「ない」 (casual) or 「ません」 (polite). 「ない」 itself is an い-adjective with its own conjugation rules, and 「ません」 is the negative form of 「ます」. Historically, the negative auxiliary 「ず」 (later 「ぬ」) was used with verbs, but 「ない」 developed from a separate stem of verbs related to \"not existing\" or \"being absent,\" eventually generalizing to negate other verbs. The polite 「ません」 evolved from 「まう」 (to finish) in combination with the negative auxiliary 「ず」 or 「ぬ」, becoming 「ませぬ」, which then phoneticized into 「ません」.",
    "writeup": "The negative form of る-verbs is fundamental in Japanese. It is created by removing the final 「る」 from the dictionary form of a る-verb and attaching either 「ない」 for the casual form or 「ません」 for the polite form. For instance, 「食べる」 (taberu, to eat) becomes 「食べない」 (tabenai, do not eat) in casual speech and 「食べません」 (tabemasen, do not eat) in polite speech. While both generally mean \"not doing X,\" they carry different registers and nuances. \n\n「ない」 is the casual negative auxiliary verb. It behaves grammatically like an い-adjective, allowing for further conjugations such as 「なかった」 (past plain negative), 「なくて」 (te-form), 「なければ」 (conditional), and 「なかったら」 (past conditional). It can imply a general non-action (\"don't\"), a specific refusal (\"won't\"), or an unintentional inability (\"can't\").\n\n「ません」 is the polite negative form, derived from the polite auxiliary 「ます」. It provides a formal or polite way to express negative statements. Its past polite form is 「ませんでした」.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish the auxiliary verb 「ない」 used for verb negation from the adjective 「ない」 meaning \"non-existent\" or \"not having,\" which is also an い-adjective but has a different origin and function. The context clarifies which 「ない」 is being used.\n\n**Key Formations:**\n*   **る-verb (dictionary form) - る + ない**: Used for casual negative statements.\n*   **る-verb (dictionary form) - る + ません**: Used for polite negative statements.",
