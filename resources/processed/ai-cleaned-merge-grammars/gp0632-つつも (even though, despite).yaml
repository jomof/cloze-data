meaning: Even though; despite; although (indicating contradiction or internal conflict)
pronunciation:
  katakana: ツツモ
  romaji: tsutsu mo
formation:
  Verb ます-stem + つつも: Indicates an action or state occurring concurrently with or despite a contradictory
    internal state or knowledge.
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used in formal or literary contexts, often for non-physical actions or states like thinking,
    knowing, or feeling.
  function: Connects two clauses, where the second clause expresses a result or action contradictory to
    what one might expect from the first clause.
  nuance: Emphasizes a contradiction or internal conflict. It carries a more formal or literary tone than
    ながらも, and often implies a conscious awareness of the contradiction.
  counterpoint: Contrasts with ながらも, which is more broadly used and can apply to physical actions without
    as strong an emphasis on internal contradiction. Differs from ても by implying continuous existence
    of the first state rather than a hypothetical condition.
  grammatical-role: Conjunction connecting clauses.
etymology: 「つつ」 is derived from the verb 「つむ」, meaning 'to continue' or 'to repeat'. Adding 「も」 emphasizes
  the sense of 'even' or 'despite', highlighting the contrast between the actions. This form implies a
  continuous or ongoing state or action in the first clause that stands in contradiction to the second
  clause.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「つつも」 is used to express that an action or state is occurring, or a fact is known, despite a contradiction or internal conflict. It conveys meanings such as "even while ~ing," "even though ~ing," "despite ~ing," or "although ~ing."

  At its core, 「つつ」 indicates a continuous action or state, similar to 「ながら」. The addition of 「も」 emphasizes a sense of "even" or "despite," highlighting a contrast. The second clause (B) will almost always present something that is contradictory to the first clause (A). This contradiction can be an internal conflict, an unexpected outcome, or an action taken despite knowledge.

  「つつも」 attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. It is typically used for non-physical actions or ongoing mental states, such as thinking, knowing, reading, or watching. For physical actions, 「ながらも」 is generally more natural. For example, one might say 「知りつつも」 (even while knowing) but less commonly 「走りつつも」 (even while running), preferring 「走りながらも」 instead.

  「つつも」 is considered more formal than 「ながらも」 and is often encountered in written Japanese or more formal speech. It conveys a deeper sense of internal conflict or a more deliberate action taken despite contrary feelings or knowledge. It explicitly signals that the action or state in the first clause continues to hold true or exist *despite* the content of the second clause. This distinct emphasis on persistent existence of the first state, even in the face of contradiction, is what sets 「つつも」 apart from similar concessive expressions.
false_friends:
  - term: ものの
    meaning: Although, But, Even Though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ものの」 can connect clauses with contrasting ideas but doesn't necessarily imply simultaneous
      action or an internal conflict as strongly as 「つつも」. It often introduces a fact that contradicts
      expectations.
    grammar_point: ものの (although・but)
  - term: くせに
    meaning: Even though, And yet, Despite
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「くせに」 carries a strong sense of blame or resentment, implying a negative judgment about the
      contradiction, while 「つつも」 is more neutral and factual.
    grammar_point: くせに (despite and yet)
  - term: ながらも
    meaning: Even while, Despite, Although
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ながらも」 is very similar in meaning, but 「つつも」 implies a more conscious awareness of the contradiction
      or is often used with non-physical, mental actions, whereas 「ながらも」 can be used more broadly, including
      for physical actions and simply indicates simultaneous action with slight contrast.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem・Adj・Noun]ながら (although・despite)'
  - term: ても
    meaning: Even if, even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ても」 expresses a general concession, meaning 'even if' or 'even though', but it does not inherently
      imply the continuous or ongoing nature of the first clause's action or state, nor the internal conflict
      often present with 「つつも」. It can also imply a hypothetical condition.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: のに
    meaning: Despite, even though, although (expressing dissatisfaction)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「のに」 strongly expresses dissatisfaction or surprise at an unexpected outcome, often implying
      that something *should* have happened differently. 「つつも」 focuses more on the simultaneous existence
      of contradictory states or actions, rather than the speaker's emotional reaction to the outcome.
    grammar_point: のに (unexpected result)
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 「ものの」, 「くせに」, 「ながらも」, 「ても」, and 「のに」 can convey similar
  ideas of contrast, their nuances differ significantly. 「ものの」 is a more general conjunction for contradiction.
  「くせに」 carries a critical or accusatory tone, implying that the action or state is improper given the
  circumstances. 「ながらも」 is perhaps the closest in meaning to 「つつも」, but 「つつも」 tends to emphasize an internal,
  often psychological, contradiction or a more formal, literary context, especially with non-physical
  actions. 「ても」 expresses a general 'even if' or 'even though' without the emphasis on a continuous state
  or internal conflict that 「つつも」 conveys. Lastly, 「のに」 adds a nuance of dissatisfaction or surprise regarding
  the outcome of the action or state mentioned in the first clause.

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The male speaker uses 「知りつつも」 to highlight the female listener's continuous awareness of his
      affection (僕が君のことを好きだと知りつつも). The question 時々無視するのはなぜ？ then points out the playful contradiction,
      common in flirty, intimate conversations between younger people. The use of 「僕」 and 「君」 reinforces
      the casual tone.

      confusion.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: optimistic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: This sentence illustrates a character's ability to find enjoyment (新しい世界を楽しんでいる) despite initial
      confusion or bewilderment (戸惑いつつも) in a new situation. The use of `彼` suggests a third-person narrative,
      often used by a female speaker in storytelling or informative contexts.
post_example_writeup: 「つつも」 is used to express a sense of doing something despite knowing or feeling something
  contradictory. It carries a more formal tone and is often used in writing or more formal speech. The
  specific context determines whether the emphasis is on the simultaneous nature of the actions or the
  contradictory aspect. Remember that while `つつも` can be grammatically used for physical actions, `ながらも`
  is generally more natural in such cases, with `つつも` favoring mental or internal states.
