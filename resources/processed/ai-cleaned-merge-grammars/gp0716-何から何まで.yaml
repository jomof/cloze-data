        "usage-context": "Used to convey comprehensiveness or totality, similar to 'everything' or 'from beginning to end'."
    },
    "etymology": "This expression is derived from 「何」 (nani, what), 「から」 (kara, from), and 「まで」 (made, until/to). The repetition of 「何」 emphasizes the comprehensive nature of \"everything.\"",
    "writeup": "「何から何まで」 is a fixed phrase that conveys a sense of totality or comprehensiveness. It can be translated into English as \"everything and anything,\" \"from A to Z,\" or \"from head to toe,\" depending on the context. The literal interpretation is akin to \"from whatever to whatever,\" highlighting that there is no limit to what is included in a given category or scope.\n\nThis expression often functions adverbially, typically appearing at the beginning of a sentence or phrase to modify the subsequent description. It is frequently employed to emphasize the absolute entirety of something, much like \"absolutely everything\" in English. For instance, it's very common in expressions of gratitude, where the speaker is thanking someone for **all** their efforts or support, or in apologies, acknowledging responsibility for **all** the trouble caused.\n\nWhile 「何から何まで」 can describe physical resemblance (e.g., \"from head to toe\"), its usage extends to comprehensive knowledge, effort, or even widespread inaccuracies. It implies that every single detail or aspect within a specific domain is covered or affected.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these terms share similar meanings, they are not interchangeable. 「全て」 is a general term for \"all,\" but 「何から何まで」 implies a more nuanced and thorough sense of completeness. 「なんでも」 suggests variety or any random selection, whereas 「何から何まで」 indicates systematic inclusion of every element within a defined set. Lastly, 「どこもかしこも」 refers to physical omnipresence, distinct from the thematic or qualitative comprehensiveness of 「何から何まで」. Understanding these subtle differences is key to natural usage.",
