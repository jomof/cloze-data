    "writeup": "「何から何まで」 is a set phrase similar to expressions like \"everything from A to Z,\" \"everything and anything,\" or \"from head to toe\" in English. Literally, it means \"from whatever to whatever,\" indicating that there's no limit to what's included in a certain category. It's often used like an adverb at the beginning of a sentence to describe a situation or express gratitude for everything someone has done.",
