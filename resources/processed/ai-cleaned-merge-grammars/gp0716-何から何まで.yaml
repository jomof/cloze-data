    "etymology": "This expression is derived from 「何」 (nani, what), 「から」 (kara, from), and 「まで」 (made, until/to). The repetition of 「何」 emphasizes the comprehensive nature of \"everything.\"",
    "writeup": "「何から何まで」 is a set phrase similar to expressions like \"everything from A to Z,\" \"everything and anything,\" or \"from head to toe\" in English. Literally, it means \"from whatever to whatever,\" indicating that there's no limit to what's included in a certain category. It's often used like an adverb at the beginning of a sentence to describe a situation or express gratitude for everything someone has done.",

            "listener_gender": "male",
            "listener_age": "older",
            "nuance": "The sentence uses `聞きな` (kikina), a plain imperative form which, while direct, can be used informally between colleagues or when giving advice. The combination of `speaker_gender` and `speaker_age` to `listener_gender` and `listener_age` suggests a younger male respectfully, but casually, advising an older male colleague."

            "nuance": "This phrase uses the polite past tense `ありがとうございました` (arigatou gozaimashita) with `{何から何まで}`, showing complete gratitude for all past actions.

            "nuance": "The extended phrase `{何から何まで} お世話になり 本当に ありがとうございました` conveys profound and sincere gratitude for comprehensive support. The formal `お世話になり` (osewa ni nari) reinforces the polite register, common when a younger female acknowledges the extensive care received from an older male, perhaps a mentor or senior."

            "nuance": "The use of `〜って` (tte) and `〜そうだ` (sou da) clearly marks this as casual speech, typical of friends discussing something they've heard. A younger male speaker to a younger female listener fits this conversational style perfectly, maintaining an informal yet informative tone."
