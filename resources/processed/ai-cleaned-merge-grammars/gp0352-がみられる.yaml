        "[Noun] + が + 見られる": "Indicates that something can be seen, observed, or is evident."
    },
    "etymology": "見られる is the potential/passive form of the verb 見る (miru), meaning 'to see'. The が particle marks the subject that can be seen or observed. Thus, the literal sense of 'something can be seen' evolved into indicating that something is observable or evident.",
    "writeup": "Unlike 「見える」, which focuses on whether something is visible or not, 「が見られる」 (the potential form of 「見る」) focuses on the viewer's physical ability to see something. Due to this, 「が見られる」 is used to highlight things that require some form of 'effort' to see, like 'changes' or 'trends.' As a result of the 'effort' that is required, 「が見られる」 is often translated as \"for (A) to be evident,\" \"it can be observed that (A),\" \"it can be seen that (A),\" and other similar structures. To use 「が見られる」, simply add it after the noun that you would like to show as being 'evident'. As 「られる」 is both the potential and passive form of 「見る」, it may be interpreted either way. However, in the case of *ra-nuki kotoba* (「ら」 removed verbs), only possibility may be expressed, not passivity. Note that use of *ra-nuki kotoba* is generally considered informal and may be viewed negatively in certain contexts.",
