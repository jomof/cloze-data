    "writeup": "The grammar point 「がみられる」 indicates that something can be seen, observed, or is evident. It is derived from the potential or passive form of the verb 「見る」 (miru, \"to see\"). Unlike 「見える」, which simply states that something *is* visible, 「がみられる」 emphasizes the ability or possibility to see something, often implying that some effort or specific conditions are required.\n\nBecause 「見られる」 is both the potential and passive form of 「見る」, it can be interpreted in either way. However, in the case of *ra-nuki kotoba* (「ら」-removed verbs), only potential may be expressed, not passivity.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   The particle 「が」 marks the subject that can be seen or observed.\n*   This grammar point is often used with nouns that represent changes, trends, or phenomena that require observation.",
