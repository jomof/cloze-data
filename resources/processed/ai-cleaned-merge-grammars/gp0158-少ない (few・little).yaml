        "part-of-speech": "adjective",
        "function": "Used to indicate a small quantity or number. It cannot be used directly before a noun, except in relative clauses.",
        "nuance": "This adjective indicates that the quantity or number of something is not abundant. It is often used to describe scarcity or insufficiency. In a sentence, 「少ない」 typically functions as a predicate, describing the noun that is its subject, e.g., 「猫が少ない」 (neko ga sukunai - there are few cats). While it is an い-adjective, it cannot directly modify a noun like a regular adjective in phrases like 「少ない猫」. Instead, when modifying a noun, it must do so within a relative clause structure, such as 「猫が少ない町」 (neko ga sukunai machi - a town where cats are few). This distinction is crucial for correct usage.",
        "counterpoint": "「多い」 (ooi) is the direct antonym, meaning \"many\" or \"much.\" Both describe quantity but in opposite directions. For example, 「人が多い」 (hito ga ooi - many people) contrasts with 「人が少ない」 (hito ga sukunai - few people).",
        "colocation": "Often used with nouns related to quantity or number, such as 人口 (jinkō - population), 経験 (keiken - experience), 時間 (jikan - time), 機会 (kikai - opportunity), 利益 (rieki - profit), 雪 (yuki - snow).",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a predicative adjective (e.g., 「猫が少ない」) or within relative clauses to modify nouns (e.g., 「猫が少ない町」). Its negative form, 「少なくない」, serves as a double negative, meaning \"not few\" or \"quite a lot,\" subtly implying a significant number or amount without directly stating \"many.\"",
        "logical-flow": "The usage of 「少ない」 implies a comparison to an expected or desired quantity, indicating a deficit. The logical flow often follows the pattern: Subject (quantity) + が + 少ない.",
        "temporal-flow": "Can be used in present (少ない) and past (少なかった) tenses to describe current or past states of scarcity.",
        "spatial-flow": "While not directly spatial, it can describe quantities within a defined space, such as 「この町には猫が少ない」 (kono machi ni wa neko ga sukunai - there are few cats in this town)."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「少ない」 (sukunai) comes from the verb 「すくす」 (sukusu, now obsolete) meaning \"to diminish\" or \"to reduce.\" Over time, it evolved to describe a state where something is diminished in quantity or number.",
    "writeup": "「少ない・すくない」 is an い-adjective that means \"few,\" \"little,\" or \"a small number/quantity of something.\" It indicates that the amount or number of something is not abundant. It is important to note that 「少ない」 is generally **not** used directly before a noun. However, it can be used in relative clauses where 「少ない」 is the predicate of the subject of the relative clause. For example, 「いいレストランが{少ない}町」 (ii resutoran ga {sukunai} machi - a town with few good restaurants) is an acceptable usage.",

For example, 「人口が少ない」 means a small *number* of people, but 「人口が小さい」 would be incorrect as population refers to quantity, not physical size. Similarly, 「水が少ない」 means a small *amount* of water, whereas 「水が小さい」 would mean the water itself is physically small, which doesn't make sense in most contexts.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid mixing up 「少ない」 with similar expressions, remember that 「少ない」 (sukunai) is an い-adjective used to describe something's quantity or number as inherently small or few, usually as a predicate. 「少し」 (sukoshi) is primarily an adverb that means \"a little\" or \"a bit,\" and can modify verbs or nouns (when used with の). 「僅か」 (wazuka) is also an adverb or な-adjective that emphasizes an extremely small, often insufficient, amount, conveying a sense of 'only' or 'merely.' Finally, 「小さい」 (chiisai) describes physical size or dimension. Focus on whether you're describing the inherent quantity as small (少ない), quantifying an action or noun (少し), emphasizing the insignificance of a small amount (僅か), or describing physical size (小さい).",

    "post_example_writeup": "The examples provided illustrate how 「少ない」 is used in various contexts to denote a small quantity or number, whether referring to tangible items like cats or intangible concepts like opportunities and profits. Pay attention to how it functions as an い-adjective, often predicating a noun that is the subject of the sentence, or modifying a noun in a relative clause. The double negative form 「少なくない」 (not few) is particularly useful for subtly implying a significant number or amount without directly stating 'many,' as seen in various contexts from resources to interest. It is crucial to remember that while 「少ない」 describes inherent small quantity or number, it contrasts with words like 「少し」 which quantifies an action or noun, and 「僅か」 which emphasizes insufficiency. These examples collectively demonstrate the versatility of 「少ない」 in describing scarcity across different domains.",
