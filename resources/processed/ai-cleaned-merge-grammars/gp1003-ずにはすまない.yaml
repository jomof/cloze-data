    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「ずにはすまない」 is derived from a combination of classical and modern Japanese grammar. 「ず」 is the negative auxiliary verb in classical Japanese. 「に」 is a case-marking particle. 「は」 is an adverbial particle. 「済む(すむ)」 means \"to come to pass\" or \"to finish.\" The negative form 「済まない」 indicates that something will not come to an end or be resolved unless a certain action is taken. Therefore, the literal translation is \"it will not come to pass that (A) is not done.\"",
    "writeup": "「ずにはすまない」 indicates that one **has no choice but to do something** or **won't get away without doing something**. It's a formal expression combining the classical negative auxiliary verb 「ず」, the case-marking particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negated form of the verb 「済む(すむ)」 meaning \"to come to pass\" or \"to finish.\"\n\n*   The literal translation is something like, \"It will not come to pass that (A) is not done,\" which conveys the feeling that something must be done.\n\n*   This grammar point exclusively follows verbs.\n*   When 「する」 is used, the correct conjugation is 「ぜず」.\n\nA similar expression, 「(Verb-ない form)ではすまない」, carries the same meaning as 「ずにはすまない」.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nThis construction might sound unnatural if the speaker's feelings alone necessitate the action. It is generally used when the action would be expected by everyone.",
