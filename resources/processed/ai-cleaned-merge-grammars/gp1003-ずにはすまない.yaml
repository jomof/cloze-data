    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずにはすまない」 is composed of 「ず」, the negative classical auxiliary verb, 「に」, a case-marking particle, 「は」, an adverbial particle, and 「済む(すむ)」 in its negative form 「すまない」. Literally, it means 'it will not do to not do (something).'",
    "writeup": "「ずにはすまない」 indicates that one “has no choice but to (A),” or “won’t get away without doing (A).” It's a formal expression combining the negative classical auxiliary verb 「ず」, the case-marking particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negated form of the verb 「済む(すむ)」 meaning “to come to pass” or “to finish.” Therefore, a more literal translation is “it will not come to pass that (A) is not done,” with the common English interpretations conveying the same sense. As 「ず」is used, it follows verbs. Also, like other instances where 「ず」 is used with 「する」, 「ぜず」 will be the correct conjugation pattern. The standard (ない) negative form of a verb may also be followed by 「ではすまない」, carrying the same meaning as 「ずにはすまない」.\n\n*Important Consideration:*\nThis construction can sound unnatural if the speaker only considers (A) necessary based on their personal feelings. (A) is usually an action expected by anyone.",
