    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「ずにはすまない」 is derived from a combination of classical and modern Japanese grammar. 「ず」 is the negative auxiliary verb in classical Japanese. 「に」 is a case-marking particle. 「は」 is an adverbial particle. 「済む(すむ)」 means \"to come to pass\" or \"to finish.\" The negative form 「済まない」 indicates that something will not come to an end or be resolved unless a certain action is taken. Therefore, the literal translation is \"it will not come to pass that (A) is not done.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「ずにはすまない」 conveys a strong sense of obligation or inevitability, meaning one **has no choice but to do something** or **won't get away without doing something**. It is a formal and somewhat stiff expression.\n\nThis structure combines the classical negative auxiliary verb 「ず」, the case-marking particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negated form of the verb 「済む(すむ)」. The literal interpretation is that 'it will not come to pass that (A) is not done,' which effectively means the action (A) is unavoidable.\n\n**Usage Notes:**\n*   This pattern exclusively follows verbs. To form it, attach it to the stem of a verb's negative (`-ない`) form, removing the `ない`.\n*   When using the verb する (to do), the correct form is せずにはすまない (or ぜずにはすまない, though せず is more common for this pattern).\n*   A similar, albeit slightly less formal, expression is 「(Verb-ない form)ではすまない」, which carries essentially the same meaning.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\nThis construction is typically used when the obligation is externally imposed or generally accepted as necessary by others, rather than based solely on the speaker's personal feelings. It implies that failing to perform the action would lead to negative consequences or an unresolved situation.",
