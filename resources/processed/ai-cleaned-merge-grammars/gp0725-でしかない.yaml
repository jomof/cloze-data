    "etymology": "The grammar point 「でしかない」 is formed from 「で」 (the conjunctive form of the copula 「だ」), 「しか」 (meaning \"only\" or \"nothing but\"), and 「ない」 (the negative form of 「ある」, indicating absence or lack). The combination creates the nuance of something being 'nothing more than' or 'merely' the stated noun.",
    "writeup": "「でしかない」 indicates that something is \"merely,\" \"nothing but,\" or \"no more than\" what is stated. It emphasizes the limited value or significance of something. This pattern is used directly after nouns. Like other constructions involving しか, it focuses on exclusivity, but here it applies specifically to nouns and often carries a judgmental or dismissive tone.\n\nWhile 「でしかない」 can be used with either a positive or neutral connotation, it tends to imply a slightly negative nuance in relation to the noun, suggesting that something lacks value or significant meaning beyond its basic definition. For instance, 「それはお金でしかない」 (That's nothing but money) implies that money alone has limited intrinsic value. It is similar to 「にすぎない」 or 「しか〜ない」, but the key difference is its direct attachment to nouns using 「で」 and its often dismissive nuance.",

            "meaning": "No more than, just, merely",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「にすぎない」 emphasizes the limited extent or degree of something objectively, whereas 「でしかない」 carries a stronger, often slightly negative connotation, implying a judgment or dismissal of its value or significance beyond what is stated."
        },
        {
            "term": "しか〜ない",
            "meaning": "There's only, nothing but",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「しか〜ない」 is primarily used to express that there is only one option, quantity, or possibility. While it also implies limitation, 「でしかない」 specifically describes that something *is* nothing more than the stated noun, often with a qualitative judgment rather than a quantitative one."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「にすぎない」 and 「しか〜ない」 are similar to 「でしかない」, it's crucial to recognize the subtle differences in nuance. Use 「にすぎない」 when emphasizing the limited extent of something in a more objective way. Use 「しか〜ない」 when indicating the only option or quantity available. Choose 「でしかない」 when implying that something lacks value or is simply 'nothing more' than what it is, often with a dismissive or critical nuance.",
