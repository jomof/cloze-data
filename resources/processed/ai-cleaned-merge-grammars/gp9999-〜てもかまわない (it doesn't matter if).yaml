pronunciation:
  katakana: テモ カマワナイ
  romaji: temo kamawanai
formation:
  Verb て-form + もかまわない: Expresses that an action is permissible or that one does not mind if it occurs.
  い-Adjective stem + くても + かまわない: Indicates that a certain state or quality is acceptable, or one doesn't
    mind it being that way.
  な-Adjective stem + でも + かまわない: Conveys that a state or quality represented by the な-adjective is permissible
    or causes no concern.
  Noun + でも + かまわない: States that a noun, or an action related to it, is acceptable, or that one has no
    objection.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The phrase combines the concessive particle 「ても」 (even if) with the negative plain form of
  the verb 「構う (かまう)」. 「構う」 means 'to mind', 'to care', or 'to be concerned about'. Therefore, 「構わない (かまわない)」
  literally translates to 'I don't mind' or 'I don't care'. When combined as 「〜てもかまわない」, it forms a construction
  that means 'even if (something happens), I don't mind/care', signifying permissibility or indifference.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern 「〜てもかまわない」 is used to indicate that a certain action or state is permissible, or that the speaker has no objection to it. It literally translates to "even if (something occurs), I don't mind/care." This phrase is often used when a speaker wants to express their indifference or to give reluctant permission.

  While similar to 「〜てもいい」, which explicitly grants permission, 「〜てもかまわない」 carries a slightly different nuance. 「〜てもいい」 is a more direct way to say "it's okay to do X" or "you may do X." In contrast, 「〜てもかまわない」 implies that the speaker does not have a problem with X happening, rather than actively encouraging or approving it. It suggests a lack of negative consequence or concern on the part of the speaker.

  This pattern can be applied to verbs in the te-form, い-adjectives (in their くても form), な-adjectives (in their でも form), and nouns (in their でも form). It is a versatile expression for conveying acceptance or tolerance in various situations.

  - term: 〜てもいい
    meaning: it's okay to; you may
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てもいい」 is used to grant explicit permission or state that something is permissible. It carries
      a more positive and direct connotation of approval, whereas 「〜てもかまわない」 implies mere indifference
      or absence of objection.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜てもいい (it's okay to)
  - term: 〜ても大丈夫だ
    meaning: it's alright even if; it's safe even if
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ても大丈夫だ」 focuses on safety, well-being, or the absence of problems. It suggests that 'even
      if X happens, there will be no harm or issue.' While similar to 「〜てもかまわない」 in conveying acceptability,
      it emphasizes the lack of negative consequences or risks, rather than the speaker's indifference.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜ても大丈夫だ (it's alright even if)
  - term: 〜てはいけない
    meaning: must not; must not do
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「〜てはいけない」 expresses a strong prohibition or obligation not to do something. It is the direct
      opposite of 「〜てもかまわない」, which indicates permissibility or lack of objection.
    grammar_point: 〜てはいけない・〜てはならない (must not)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「〜てもかまわない」, 「〜てもいい」, and 「〜ても大丈夫だ」 can all express permissibility, their
  nuances differ. Use 「〜てもいい」 when you want to grant explicit permission or state clear approval. Opt
  for 「〜ても大丈夫だ」 when the focus is on the safety, security, or overall well-being related to an action.
  Choose 「〜てもかまわない」 when you want to convey that you simply do not object or do not mind, often with a
  hint of indifference or resignation. For prohibitions, the clear choice is 「〜てはいけない」.

post_example_writeup: When using 「〜てもかまわない」, pay close attention to the context to convey the intended
  nuance of indifference or reluctant acceptance. While grammatically similar to 「〜てもいい」, its subtle difference
  in meaning can significantly impact how your message is received. It is particularly useful when you
  want to signal that something is acceptable, but perhaps not ideal, or simply that you have no strong
  feelings against it.
