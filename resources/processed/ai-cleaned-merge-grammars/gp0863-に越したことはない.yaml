    "etymology": "This grammar point combines に (a particle), 越した (koshita, the past tense of 越す kosu, meaning \"to cross over\" or \"to surpass\"), こと (koto, \"thing\" or \"matter\"), は (wa, a topic marker), and ない (nai, \"not\"). Literally, it suggests that there is nothing that surpasses a certain state or action.",
    "writeup": "「に越したことはない」 is used to express that something is the best, most desirable, or ideal. It conveys the meaning of \"there is nothing better than (A)\" or \"(A) would be the best.\" This structure is commonly used with verbs, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives/nouns, each in their dictionary forms (or with である for な-adjectives and nouns). It's used to present something positive or an ideal outcome that is wished for. It is also used after words that use 「ない」, which changes the meaning to \"it would be best if not (A).\"",
