    "writeup": "The phrase 「に越したことはない」 expresses the idea that \"there is nothing better than (A)\" or \"(A) would be the best.\" It combines 「に」, the past-tense form of the verb 「越す」 (kosu, meaning \"to cross over\" or \"to surpass\"), 「こと」, 「は」, and 「ない」. Literally, it translates to \"there is nothing beyond (A)\" or \"nothing surpasses (A).\" This structure can be used with verbs, adjectives, and nouns in their plain forms. Sentences using 「に越したことはない」 generally present something positive or an ideal outcome that is desired.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\nIt's common to see 「に越したことはない」 following words that use 「ない」. In these cases, the meaning shifts to \"it would be best if not (A)\" rather than \"(A) would be the best.\"",
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に越したことはない」 is derived from the verb 「越す」 (kosu), which means \"to surpass\" or \"to exceed.\" The phrase implies that there's nothing that can surpass the described situation or action in terms of desirability.",
