    "etymology": "The kanji for the cardinal directions (北, 南, 東, 西) are ancient, stemming from pictographic or ideographic representations related to their respective positions or natural phenomena. For instance, 東 (east) is said to represent the sun rising behind a tree. 西 (west) might depict a bird returning to its nest at sunset. 南 (south) and 北 (north) are also rooted in ancient Chinese characters. The suffix ～口 (kuchi/guchi) literally means 'mouth' and is extended to mean 'entrance' or 'exit', as in the 'mouth' of a passage.",
    "writeup": "The Japanese terms for the cardinal directions – **北** (kita), **南** (minami), **東** (higashi), and **西** (nishi) – are fundamental for spatial orientation and navigation. They are essential for describing locations, giving directions, and understanding geographical references. These terms are straightforward and widely used in everyday conversation, news, and official documents. They can be combined to form intermediate directions like **北東** (hokutō - northeast) or **南西** (nansē - southwest). \n\nBeyond simple directions, the suffix **～口** (guchi/kuchi) is critically important, especially in urban environments. It literally means \"mouth\" but is used to denote an \"entrance\" or \"exit,\" most commonly seen at train stations or large buildings. For example, **東口** (higashiguchi) means \"east exit,\" and **西口** (nishiguchi) means \"west exit.\" Understanding these terms is vital for navigating Japan's public transportation system. The pronunciation of ～口 changes to ～ぐち (guchi) when preceded by certain sounds, such as those ending in a vowel or 'n', following a common Japanese sound change phenomenon called *rendaku* (連濁).",
