jlpt: N3
etymology: The origin of すっかり is not clearly documented as deriving from a specific kanji or older word.
  It is believed to be an onomatopoeic or mimetic word (副詞, fukushi) that conveys a sense of thoroughness
  or complete change. Such words often arise from the sound or feeling of an action or state rather than
  a concrete root. It embodies the feeling of something being 'wiped clean' or 'finished entirely' without
  remainder.
writeup: すっかり is an adverb used to express that an action or state has occurred **completely**, **entirely**,
  or **thoroughly**. It conveys a sense of finality and often implies a significant or even surprising
  change. While it can translate simply to "completely," its nuance goes deeper, suggesting that something
  has vanished, forgotten, or transformed in its entirety. It is commonly used with verbs that denote
  a change of state, such as forgetting (忘れる), getting well (良くなる), or disappearing (なくなる). It can also
  be paired with adjectives to emphasize the absolute nature of a state, like **すっかり元気 (completely healthy)**
  or **すっかり大人 (completely grown up)**. One key aspect of すっかり is its implication of a process that has
  run its full course, leaving no room for partiality. For instance, if you say **すっかり忘れた (sukkari wasureta)**,
  it means you have *completely* forgotten, not just partially. This can sometimes carry a nuance of surprise
  or realization that the change is more profound than initially thought. It's often used when talking
  about things that have been naturally or unexpectedly completed.

  - term: 全然 (not at all; totally)
    meaning: not at all (with negative) or totally (with positive).
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 全然 can mean "totally" with positive expressions, it primarily signifies "not at all"
      when used with negative verbs or adjectives. すっかり exclusively means "completely" in a positive or
      neutral sense of completion, often with a nuance of surprise or thoroughness of change.
    grammar_point: 全然 (not at all; totally)
  - term: 完全に (completely)
    meaning: completely, perfectly.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 完全に is more objective and neutral, emphasizing perfection or faultless completion. すっかり often
      implies a state change that is thorough, sometimes with a nuance of naturalness or unexpectedness.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:完全に (completely)
  - term: 全て (all・everything)
    meaning: all, everything.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 全て refers to the entirety of a quantity or collection of things. すっかり describes the completeness
      of an action or state, not necessarily the quantity of items.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:全て (all・everything)
  - term: もはや (no longer)
    meaning: no longer, already, now.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: もはや focuses on the state of something being "no longer" the case, implying a complete cessation
      or change from a previous condition. While both can express complete change, すっかり highlights the
      thoroughness of the change itself, whereas もはや emphasizes the resultant absence of the former state.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:もはや (no longer)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between すっかり and these similar expressions, consider the focus.
  すっかり emphasizes the completeness of an action or state transformation. If you are negating something
  entirely, 全然 with a negative verb is the appropriate choice. For a more objective and perfect sense
  of completion, use 完全に. If you're referring to the totality of items, 全て is correct. Finally, if you
  want to stress that a previous state has definitively ended, もはや is often used.
