jlpt: N5
etymology: The demonstrative pronoun series, known as the 'ko-so-a-do' series (ここ, そこ, あそこ, どこ), has roots
  in Old Japanese. They are fundamentally spatial deictics, meaning their reference changes depending
  on the speaker's and listener's positions. あそこ specifically refers to a location far from both the speaker
  and the listener, emphasizing a shared understanding of a distant 'third' location.
writeup: The Japanese language employs a system of demonstrative pronouns, the 'ko-so-a-do' series, to
  indicate relative distance. Among these, あそこ (asoko) denotes a place that is distant from both the speaker
  and the listener. It is used when referring to a location that is neither near the speaker (ここ - koko)
  nor near the listener (そこ - soko), but rather further away, often out of immediate sight, or a place
  mutually understood to be remote. While it primarily refers to physical locations, あそこ can also be used
  abstractly to refer to a general 'area' or 'situation' that is distant or conceptually separate.

post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the 'ko-so-a-do' system is crucial for accurate spatial reference
  in Japanese. Remember that こ-words (ここ, これ) indicate proximity to the speaker, そ-words (そこ, それ) proximity
  to the listener, あ-words (あそこ, あれ) distance from both, and ど-words (どこ, どれ) are interrogative. Applying
  this framework helps distinguish between similar-sounding demonstratives.
