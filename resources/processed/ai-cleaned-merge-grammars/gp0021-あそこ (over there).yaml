jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to refer to a location that is distant from both the speaker and the listener. Can
    also refer to an abstract place or concept.
  function: Spatial deixis, referring to a distant location.
  nuance: Implies physical distance, but can also refer to a non-physical "there" like a memory or a future
    event. It can also imply a slight sense of vagueness or "that place I'm thinking of."
  grammatical-role: Functions as a noun or pronoun of place.
etymology: The Japanese demonstrative system (ko-so-a-do) is fundamental. The 'a' series (あそこ・あれ・あの・あちら・あっち)
  consistently refers to things or places far from both speaker and listener. Historically, these forms
  developed from older demonstrative roots, with あそこ stemming from a combination of the 'a' series root
  and a word related to "place" or "direction." It's part of a highly systematic linguistic pattern for
  indicating spatial relationships relative to the interlocutors.
writeup: |-
  「あそこ」 is a demonstrative pronoun of place in Japanese, part of the fundamental ko-so-a-do (こ・そ・あ・ど) system. This system categorizes items or locations based on their distance relative to the speaker and listener. The 'a' series, which includes 「あそこ」, is used when referring to something that is far away from both the speaker and the listener. For instance, if you and your friend are both looking at a building across the street, you would refer to it as 「あそこ」.

  While typically used for physical locations, 「あそこ」 can also refer to abstract concepts or non-physical "places," such as a distant memory, a future goal, or a sensitive topic that one wishes to avoid explicitly naming. It carries a casual to neutral register, making it suitable for everyday conversation.
false_friends:
  - term: ここ
    meaning: here
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「ここ」 refers to "here," the immediate vicinity of the speaker, whereas 「あそこ」 refers to a place
      far from both speaker and listener.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ここ・そこ・あそこ・どこ (here・there・over there・where)
  - term: そこ
    meaning: there (near listener)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そこ」 refers to "there," a place near the listener but away from the speaker, while 「あそこ」 is
      far from both.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ここ・そこ・あそこ・どこ (here・there・over there・where)
  - term: どこ
    meaning: where
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どこ」 is the interrogative form, asking "where?" while 「あそこ」 provides the answer "over there."
      They belong to the same demonstrative series.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ここ・そこ・あそこ・どこ (here・there・over there・where)
  - term: あちら
    meaning: that way over there (formal)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あちら」 is the more polite and sometimes broader directional term for "that way over there"
      or "that side," whereas 「あそこ」 is specifically "that place over there" and is generally less formal.
    grammar_point: あちら (that way over there, formal)
  - term: 向こう
    meaning: beyond, over there, that side
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both refer to something "over there," 「向こう」 often implies "the other side" or "beyond,"
      or a less specific, broader area, whereas 「あそこ」 points to a more distinct, distant location.
    grammar_point: 向こう (beyond)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between 「あそこ」 and other demonstratives like 「ここ」 and 「そこ」,
  remember the speaker and listener's relative positions. 「ここ」 is near the speaker, 「そこ」 is near the listener,
  and 「あそこ」 is far from both. While 「あちら」 and 「向こう」 can also mean "over there," 「あちら」 adds formality,
  and 「向こう」 often implies "the other side" or a less specific direction.

        english: My childhood memories are in my heart.
        hint: 「あそこ」 is used here to refer to a specific, though abstract, past location in memory, not

    scene: A person reflecting on their past, perhaps looking at an old photo or landmark that triggers
      a memory.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「あそこ」 is used to refer to a non-physical, nostalgic "place" in one's past. The specific Japanese
      「子供 の 時 の 思い出」 clearly frames it as a memory, making the use of 「あそこ」 metaphorical for the 'place'
      where those memories reside.

    scene: A team leader addressing their team about a long-term project with a distant target.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「あそこ」 here refers to a distant, perhaps challenging, future goal or target, treating it like
      a tangible location. The particle 「に」 reinforces this sense of a fixed point where the goal resides.

          away people'.
    scene: Two people observing a distant group at a festival from afar.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「あそこ の 人 たち」 uses 「あそこ」 to refer to the group of people associated with that distant place.
      It's a common way to refer to a group without explicitly naming them, implying they are 'the people
      from over there'.

          of the meeting point from the current location of both speakers.
    scene: Two friends making plans over the phone for a specific meeting spot in a park.

          - あの 時 の こと は あまり 話し たく ない です。
        english: I don't really want to talk about that time's matter.
        hint: While 「あの 時」 refers to 'that time,' 「あそこ」 can be used more vaguely to refer to a past incident
          or situation as a 'place' one doesn't want to revisit.
    scene: Someone avoiding a sensitive or unpleasant topic in conversation, hinting that 'that place'
      refers to a past incident.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: serious
    nuance: In this context, 「あそこ」 is used metaphorically to refer to a past event or situation without
      explicitly naming it. It implies a 'place' in one's history that they prefer not to revisit, often
      carrying a melancholic or evasive nuance.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「あそこ」 is versatile, applying to both physical locations
  and abstract concepts. Its correct usage hinges on the relative distance of the referred 'place' from
  both the speaker and the listener. Pay attention to the particle used with 「あそこ」 as it indicates the
  grammatical function, whether it's the location of existence (に), action (で), or direction (へ).
