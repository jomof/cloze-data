    "writeup": "The particle 「や」 is used to list **non-exhaustive examples** of nouns, indicating that the items mentioned are just a few instances from a larger group. It is similar to \"and so on\" or \"things like\" in English. Unlike 「と」, which forms an exhaustive list of all possibilities, 「や」 implies that there are other unmentioned items. For instance, saying 「りんご {や} みかん」 suggests there are other fruits besides apples and oranges. This particle is exclusively used with nouns and cannot follow verb phrases. For listing verbs, 「とか」 or 「たり」 would be used instead.",
