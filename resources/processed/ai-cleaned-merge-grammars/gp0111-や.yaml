    "etymology": "The particle 「や」 is thought to have originated from the verb 「止(や)む」 (yamu), meaning \"to stop\" or \"to cease.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate a pause or break in a list, implying that more items could be added but are not explicitly mentioned.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「や」 is used to list **non-exhaustive examples** of nouns. It indicates that the items mentioned are just a few examples from a larger group. It's similar to \"and so on\" or \"things like\" in English. Unlike 「と」, which provides an exhaustive list, 「や」 implies that there are other unmentioned items. For example, saying 「りんご {や} みかん」 suggests there are other fruits besides apples and oranges. It is always used with nouns, not verbs. You would use 「とか」 or 「たり」 when listing verbs.",
