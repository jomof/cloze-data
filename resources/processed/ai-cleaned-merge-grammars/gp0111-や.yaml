    "etymology": "The particle 「や」 is thought to have originated from the verb 「止(や)む」 (yamu), meaning \"to stop\" or \"to cease.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate a pause or break in a list, implying that more items could be added but are not explicitly mentioned.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「や」 is used to list **non-exhaustive examples** of nouns, indicating that the items mentioned are just a few instances from a larger group. It is similar to \"and so on\" or \"things like\" in English. Unlike 「と」, which implies a complete list of all possibilities, 「や」 suggests that there are other unmentioned items within the same category. For instance, saying 「りんご {や} みかん」 indicates that there are other fruits besides apples and oranges. This particle is exclusively used with nouns and cannot follow verb phrases. For listing verbs or actions, 「とか」 or 「たり」 would be used instead.",
