    "writeup": "The particle 「や」 is used to list **non-exhaustive examples** of nouns, indicating that the items mentioned are just a few instances from a larger group. It is similar to \"and so on\" or \"things like\" in English. Unlike 「と」, which implies a complete list of all possibilities, 「や」 suggests that there are other unmentioned items within the same category. For instance, saying 「りんご {や} みかん」 indicates that there are other fruits besides apples and oranges. This particle is exclusively used with nouns and cannot follow verb phrases.
