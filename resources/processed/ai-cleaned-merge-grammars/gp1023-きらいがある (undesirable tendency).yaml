details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: Generally used
  function: Indicates the presence of negative tendencies or habits.
  nuance: Implies a negative or undesirable inclination; often softened with adverbs like 少し or どうも.
  counterpoint: Not typically used to describe one's own tendencies due to its critical implication.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a predicate or part of a connective clause.
  logical-flow: Presents a conclusion or observation about a characteristic.
  temporal-flow: Describes an ongoing or habitual tendency.
  spatial-flow: Not applicable to spatial flow.
etymology: This grammar point combines 「嫌い (kirai)」, meaning "dislike" or "aversion," with the verb 「ある
  (aru)」, meaning "to exist" or "to be." The literal sense is "there is a dislike," which evolves into
  the nuance of having a tendency towards something undesirable. The character 嫌 (いや) inherently carries
  a negative connotation, reinforcing its usage for undesirable traits. Its transition to hiragana in
  modern writing (きらいがある) highlights its grammaticalized use rather than a literal "dislike" meaning.
writeup: 「きらいがある (kirai ga aru)」 expresses a tendency toward something undesirable. It combines the noun
  「嫌い (kirai)」 (dislike), the particle 「が (ga)」, and the verb 「ある (aru)」 (to be). It suggests a habit
  or inclination that isn't necessarily extreme, but noticeable. Often used with adverbs like 「少し (sukoshi)」
  (a little) or 「どうも (dōmo)」 (somehow) to soften the tone. It is generally not used to describe one's
  own tendencies, as it implies a critical perspective. This expression is primarily used to describe
  undesirable traits or habits of others, or general negative tendencies in situations or phenomena. While
  its literal kanji form is 嫌い, it is almost exclusively written in hiragana as きらいがある in modern Japanese.

  - term: 傾向がある
    meaning: Tendency, Trend, Inclination
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「きらいがある」, 「傾向がある (keikō ga aru)」 is more general and neutral. It refers to a broader
      tendency or trend, which can be positive, negative, or neutral, whereas 「きらいがある」 implies a more
      specific, often undesirable, inclination.
    grammar_point: 傾向がある (tendency)
  - term: がち
    meaning: Apt to do, Tend to do, Prone to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「きらいがある」, 「がち (gachi)」 also means "tend to," but is typically used for more frequent
      or habitual actions, which can be positive or negative. 「きらいがある」 implies a slightly more critical
      or judgmental perspective specifically on an undesirable trait or habit. 「がち」 also has a broader
      application, attaching to nouns or verbs, while 「きらいがある」 usually attaches to verb plain forms or
      nouns with の.
    grammar_point: がち (tend to)
  - term: やすい
    meaning: Easy to do, prone to, apt to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「きらいがある」, 「やすい」 indicates a general ease or susceptibility to perform an action or
      enter a state, which can be positive, negative, or neutral. While it can imply a negative "prone
      to," it lacks the inherent critical or undesirable judgment that 「きらいがある」 carries. 「きらいがある」 specifically
      points out an undesirable inclination, whereas 「やすい」 is broader.
    grammar_point: やすい (easy to do・likely to)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「傾向がある (keikō ga aru)」, 「がち (gachi)」, and 「きらいがある (kirai ga aru)」 all
  express tendencies, they differ significantly in nuance. Use 「傾向がある」 for general trends (can be positive,
  negative, or neutral), 「がち」 for frequent habits (often negative, but can be neutral and covers broader
  attachment patterns), and 「きらいがある」 for specific, often undesirable, inclinations or faults. The key
  distinction for 「きらいがある」 is its inherent negative connotation and its use in more formal or critical
  contexts when describing a problematic aspect of someone or something.
examples:
  - english: He has a tendency not to keep promises.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 約束 を 守ら ない {きらい が ある}。
      - 彼 は 約束 を 守ら ない {きらい が ある} よ。
      - あいつ は 約束 を 守ら ない {きらい が ある} ん だ よ な。
      - 彼 は 約束 を 守ら ない {きらい が あり ます}。
    english_literally: He has a tendency not to keep promises.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 約束 を 守ら ない こと が 多い
        english: It is often the case that he doesn't keep promises.
        hint: The speaker's frustration and the sense of a character flaw are better conveyed by 「きらいがある」
          than by a neutral statement of frequency like 「多い」.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 約束 を 守ら ない 傾向 が ある
        english: He has a tendency not to keep promises.
        hint: While 「傾向がある」 is possible, 「きらいがある」 carries a more critical and undesirable nuance, fitting
          the complaint about a negative character trait.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 約束 を 破り がち だ。
        english: He is prone to breaking promises.
        hint: 「がち」 indicates a frequent habit or tendency, often negative, by attaching to verb stems.
          We're looking for a general undesirable inclination.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 約束 を 破り やすい。
        english: He is prone to breaking promises.

          looking for an undesirable inclination that carries a critical nuance.

    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「きらいがある」 conveys a mild criticism of the subject's untrustworthiness. The phrase
      implies this is an inherent and undesirable trait rather than just an occasional occurrence. 「あいつ」
      and 「～んだよな」 are very casual and common among male friends.
  - english: Young people nowadays tend to jump on trends quickly.
    japanese:

      - 最近 の 若者 は、すぐ に 流行 に 飛びつく {きらい が あり ます} ね。
      - 近頃 の 若者 は、すぐ に 流行 に 飛びつく {きらい が ある} もん だ よ。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 流行 に 飛びつき やすい
        english: Young people nowadays are easy to jump on trends quickly.
        hint: 「やすい」 suggests ease or susceptibility, whereas 「きらいがある」 implies a slightly critical observation
          of a negative tendency, better suiting an older person's mild disapproval.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 流行 に 飛びつく 傾向 が ある
        english: Young people nowadays have a tendency to jump on trends quickly.
        hint: While 「傾向がある」 is neutral, 「きらいがある」 adds a subtle, undesirable nuance to the trend-following
          behavior, reflecting the speaker's slightly critical view.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 近頃 の 若者 は、すぐ に 流行 に 飛びつき がち だ。
        english: Young people nowadays are prone to jumping on trends quickly.

          on an undesirable inclination.
    scene: An older person observes youth culture with a slight sigh.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The term 「きらいがある」 here subtly expresses a slightly critical view of the tendency for quick
      adoption of trends among young people, indicating a somewhat negative observation from an older
      perspective. The phrases 「～もん だ よ」 or 「～ですね」 further indicate the speaker's contemplative or observational
      tone. The sentence does not explicitly mention gender, making it suitable for any gendered speaker.
  - english: Parents nowadays tend to be overprotective.
    japanese:
      - 最近 の 親 は 過 保護 の {きらい が ある}。
      - 最近 の 親 って 過 保護 の {きらい が あり ます} よ ね。
      - 最近 の 親 は 過 保護 の {きらい が ある} よ な。
    english_literally: Parents recently have a tendency of overprotection.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 過 保護 に なり やすい
        english: Parents nowadays are easy to become overprotective.
        hint: 「なりやすい」 focuses on the ease or susceptibility to becoming overprotective, which is less
          about a perceived ingrained flaw in modern parenting and more about an occasional tendency.
          「きらいがある」 carries the subtle criticism of this tendency being an undesirable characteristic.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 過 保護 に なる 傾向 が ある
        english: Parents nowadays have a tendency to become overprotective.
        hint: 「傾向がある」 is a neutral statement of trend. The grandparent's tone, while not harsh, implies
          a gentle disapproval of overprotection, which 「きらいがある」 conveys more accurately than a neutral
          observation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最近 の 親 は 過 保護 に なり がち だ。
        english: Parents nowadays are prone to becoming overprotective.
        hint: 「がち」 indicates a frequent habit or tendency. 「きらいがある」 emphasizes the undesirable aspect
          of the tendency.
    scene: A grandparent reflects on how parenting has changed over generations.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「きらいがある」 here, particularly from an older speaker observing 「最近の親」 (parents nowadays),
      suggests a mild, perhaps generational, criticism of what is perceived as an undesirable trait in
      modern parenting. The phrase implies that overprotection is a problematic characteristic. The phrases
      「～って」 is a casual topic marker, and 「～よな」 is a casual sentence-ending particle often used by men
      to confirm or seek agreement.
  - english: He rarely expresses his own opinions.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 自分 の 意見 を 滅多 に 言わ ない {きらい が ある}。
      - 彼 は 自分 の 意見 を 滅多 に 申さ ない {きらい が あり ます}。
      - 彼 は 自身 の 見解 を 滅多 に 述べ ない {きらい が ある}。

          - 意見 を 言わ ない こと が 多い
        english: It is often the case that he doesn't express his opinions.
        hint: The leader's concern implies that this reticence is an undesirable trait for team dynamics,
          going beyond a simple statement of frequency.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 意見 を 言い たがら ない
        english: He is unwilling to express his opinions.
        hint: 「たがらない」 emphasizes unwillingness. While applicable, 「きらいがある」 focuses on the undesirable
          tendency itself, which is a more direct criticism of the behavior.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 自分 の 意見 を 言わ ない がち だ。
        english: He is prone to not expressing his own opinions.

          an undesirable habit.

          - 彼 は 自分 の 意見 を 言い 出し にくい。
        english: It is difficult for him to express his own opinions.
        hint: 「にくい」 (the opposite of やすい) implies difficulty. 「きらいがある」 points to an undesirable inclination
          rather than just a difficulty.
    scene: A team leader expresses concern about a quiet team member during a project meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The addition of 「滅多に (metta ni)」, meaning "rarely," emphasizes the infrequency of expressing
      opinions. 「きらいがある」 implies this is an undesirable trait, particularly in a professional setting
      where input is valued. The speaker is male, fitting the formal tone typically expected of a team
      leader. Using 「申さない」 (mōsanai) or 「述べない」 (nobenai) provides more formal or academic alternatives
      to 「言わない」 (iwanai).

      - competing_japanese:
          - 感情 的 に なる こと が 多かっ た
        english: It was often the case that she got emotional.
        hint: The phrase "the old her" implies a past negative behavior that the person has since improved
          upon, a nuance better captured by 「きらいがあった」 which denotes an undesirable inherent trait.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 感情 的 に なり がち だっ た
        english: She used to be prone to getting emotional.
        hint: While 「なりがちだった」 conveys a frequent habit, 「きらいがあった」 suggests a more ingrained, undesirable
          predisposition in her past character.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昔 の 彼女 は、感情 的 に なり すぎ やすかっ た。
        english: The old her used to be prone to getting too emotional.
        hint: 「やすい」 indicates ease or susceptibility. 「きらいがあった」 highlights that this emotional tendency

    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female

      tendency was an undesirable trait, implying she has grown out of it. The casual register and female
      speaker/listener fit a conversation between friends. Adding 「よ ね」 seeks agreement and fosters intimacy
      in the conversation.

          - 細かい 点 に こだわる こと が 多い です
        english: It is often the case that the customer is particular about minor details.
        hint: The polite yet indirect criticism using 「恐れ入りますが」 and 「きらいがあります」 suggests this particularity
          is a problematic client behavior, not just a frequent action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 細かい 点 に こだわる 傾向 が あり ます
        english: The customer has a tendency to be particular about minor details.
        hint: 「傾向がある」 is too neutral for the context of a 'difficult client.' 「きらいがあります」 subtly conveys
          the sales associate's frustration with the undesirable client trait.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 恐れ入り ます が、お 客 様 は 細かい 点 に こだわり がち です。
        english: Excuse me, but the customer is prone to being particular about minor details.
        hint: 「がち」 describes a frequent tendency, but 「きらいがあります」 conveys a more critical assessment of
          this particularity as undesirable in a business context.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 恐れ入り ます が、お 客 様 は 細かい 点 に こだわり すぎ やすい です。
        english: Excuse me, but the customer is prone to being overly particular about minor details.
        hint: 「やすい」 indicates susceptibility. 「きらいがあります」 subtly implies that this excessive particularity
          is a problematic client trait.

    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「恐れ入りますが」 establishes a polite and apologetic tone, typical in formal business
      communication. 「きらいがあります」 is used here to politely but clearly state an undesirable tendency of
      a client, avoiding direct confrontation. The female sales associate is speaking respectfully to
      her male supervisor. Using 「きらいがおありです」 offers an even more respectful way to speak about the customer's
      tendency.
  - english: That company tends to exaggerate the content of their reports, so they can't be trusted.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:

        english: Because it is often the case that they exaggerate the content of their reports, they
          can't be trusted.
        hint: The consequence "cannot be trusted" (信用できない) directly links to the negative implication
          of "きらいがあって," which is stronger than simply stating a frequent occurrence.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 報告 書 の 内容 を 誇張 する 傾向 が ある の で
        english: Because they have a tendency to exaggerate the content of their reports, they can't be
          trusted.
        hint: While 「傾向がある」 might describe the tendency, 「きらいがあって」 highlights the undesirable nature of
          this exaggeration, directly justifying the lack of trust.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 会社 は 報告 書 の 内容 を 誇張 し がち で、信用 でき ない。
        english: That company is prone to exaggerating the content of their reports, so they can't be

        english: That company tends to exaggerate the content of their reports, so they can't be trusted.

    scene: A business analyst discusses a company's dubious practices with a colleague.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The 「～て」 form connects the undesirable tendency (exaggeration) directly to its negative consequence
      (lack of trust). This demonstrates how 「きらいがある」 can be used to explain the reason for a negative
      judgment. The professional setting and male speakers convey a serious tone in this business discussion.
      「きらいがありまして」 is a polite connective, suitable for formal conversation, while 「～から、信用できないんだよ」 is a
      more casual explanation.
  - english: That leader tends to be overly optimistic, which can lead to misjudgment.

          - 楽観 的 すぎる 傾向 が ある
        english: That leader has a tendency to be too optimistic.
        hint: 「きらいがある」 suggests that this over-optimism is a problematic characteristic, more so than
          a neutral trend. We're looking for a tendency with a negative implication.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 楽観 的 すぎ がち だ
        english: That leader is prone to being too optimistic.
        hint: 「がち」 indicates a frequent habit, but 「きらいがある」 highlights the undesirable implication of

        english: That leader is easy to be too optimistic.
        hint: 「やすい」 implies ease or susceptibility, which doesn't convey the negative consequence or inherent
          problem suggested by 「きらいがある」. We're looking for a tendency that can lead to negative results.
    scene: A project manager discusses a concern about a team leader with a colleague.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「きらいがある」 indicates that the leader's excessive optimism (「楽観的すぎる」) is seen as an
      undesirable trait that can lead to negative outcomes (「判断を誤る」). This is a professional observation,
      where subtle criticism is conveyed. The choice of neutral Japanese terms and polite sentence structure
      fits a semi-formal discussion between colleagues.

        english: It is often the case that he doesn't listen to others' opinions.
        hint: While frequent, 「きらいがある」 specifically frames this as an undesirable and ingrained habit,
          not just a matter of frequency. We're looking for a problematic inherent tendency.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 人 の 意見 を 聞き たがら ない
        english: He is unwilling to listen to others' opinions.
        hint: 「たがらない」 emphasizes unwillingness. 「きらいがある」 focuses more on the established negative tendency

      - competing_japanese:
          - 人 の 意見 を 聞き 入れ ない 傾向 が ある
        english: He has a tendency not to accept others' opinions.

      female manager is speaking to a male subordinate, using a formal tone.

      This is a general commentary, suitable for a group setting. The speaker is female, but the statement
      is general and not gender-specific.

    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious

      to avoid responsibility, implying it is an undesirable trait that impacts the company negatively.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 忙しく なる と、すぐ に 物 を 忘れる 傾向 が ある
        english: When he gets busy, my older brother has a tendency to immediately forget things.
        hint: 「きらいがある」 emphasizes the negative, undesirable aspect of forgetting, which is more appropriate
          when discussing a personal fault, even if mild, rather than a neutral trend.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 忙しく なる と、すぐ に 物 を 忘れ がち だ
        english: When he gets busy, my older brother is prone to immediately forgetting things.
        hint: While 「がち」 suggests a frequent habit, 「きらいがある」 implies a slight, undesirable flaw in character
          or behavior, making it more suitable for a light complaint.
    scene: Someone explains their brother's habits to a family member or close friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: This example uses 「きらいがある」 for a milder, more common undesirable trait within a family context.
      While still conveying a negative tendency, the casual tone and familial setting imply it's a known
      quirk rather than a severe criticism. The sentence structure is common in casual conversation between
      family or friends.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「きらいがある」 consistently conveys a negative or undesirable
  tendency. Notice how it is often used with phrases that soften the directness of the criticism, such
  as 「少し」 (a little) or 「どうも」 (somehow), or used in conjunction with other clauses to explain a negative
  outcome. While it describes a 'tendency,' it carries a nuance of disapproval or a problematic aspect,
  distinguishing it from more neutral expressions of tendency.
