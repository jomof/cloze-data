    "etymology": "「逆に」is derived from the noun 「逆 (gyaku)」 meaning \"reverse\" or \"opposite,\" combined with the particle 「に (ni)」, which in this case functions to turn the noun into an adverb. Therefore, 「逆に」literally means \"in the reverse way\" or \"in the opposite manner.\"",
    "writeup": "「逆に」is an adverbial expression used to indicate that something is **contrary** to what was previously stated or expected. It signals a reversal or opposition to a prior idea.\n\nIts core function is to establish a contrast, often appearing between two clauses to connect a statement with its unexpected or opposite outcome. For instance, if action A was expected to lead to result X, 「逆に」can introduce result Y, which is the opposite or unintended consequence of A. This usage often carries a nuance of surprise or disappointment, as the actual outcome diverges from what was intended or anticipated.\n\nIn modern Japanese, 「逆に」is also frequently used at the beginning of a sentence. In this context, it functions as a **rebuttal** or a way to introduce an **alternative viewpoint** to something that has just been said. This can be a direct contradiction or simply a suggestion of a different perspective. Additionally, in very casual conversation, 「逆に」can be used as a slang version of 「別に」 (not particularly) when asked questions about preferences, implying a deferral or a turning of the question back to the other person, as in \"rather, how about you?\" or \"instead, what do you think?\"",
