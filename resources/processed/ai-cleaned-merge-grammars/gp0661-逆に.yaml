    "etymology": "「逆に」is derived from the noun 「逆 (gyaku)」 meaning \"reverse\" or \"opposite,\" combined with the particle 「に (ni)」, which in this case functions to turn the noun into an adverb. Therefore, 「逆に」literally means \"in the reverse way\" or \"in the opposite manner.\"",
    "writeup": "「逆に」is used to indicate that something is contrary to what was previously stated or expected. It functions adverbially, often appearing between two clauses to show contrast. It can also be used at the beginning of a sentence to introduce a rebuttal or express an alternative viewpoint. While versatile, its core function remains to signal a reversal or opposition to a prior idea. It is often used in everyday conversation to express that something went against your expectations.",
