        "nuance": "Carries a sense of resignation or disappointment that efforts will be undone. The と言われればそれまでだ form implies acceptance but suggests a deeper thought or alternative view. It can be used to politely concede a point while still subtly asserting one's own opinion.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a conclusive phrase, often at the end of a sentence or clause, emphasizing the outcome of a hypothetical situation."
    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「それまでだ」 is a combination of 「それ」 (that), 「まで」 (until), and 「だ」 (the plain form of 「です」, meaning 'to be'). Literally, it signifies 'until that point.' In context, this implies that once 'that point' (the condition) is reached, further effort or continuation is rendered meaningless or futile, thus leading to the meaning 'everything up to that point is in vain.' The structure highlights a critical threshold beyond which previous efforts lose their value.",
    "writeup": "「それまでだ」 is a powerful hypothetical expression used to convey that if a specific condition (A) comes to pass, all previous efforts or achievements leading up to that point will become completely meaningless or wasted. This often carries a feeling of resignation or futility.\n\nWhile the standard form for the conditional clause preceding 「それまでだ」 is often with the conjunction particle 「ば」, indicating a hypothetical or general condition (e.g., 「〜ばそれまでだ」), it can also be used with 「たら」, which implies a more definite or completed action leading to the consequence (e.g., 「〜たらそれまでだ」).\n\nIt is common to see this structure in sentences that include 「ても」 or 「でも」 in the first half, implying that \"even if (A) is done, if (B) occurs, then all is for naught.\" This highlights a situation where extensive effort might still be undone by a critical failure point.\n\n**Special Usage: 「〜と言われればそれまでだ」**\n\nThis is a unique, set expression within the broader usage of 「それまでだ」. It means 'while it is true that (A), (B)' or 'if you say that (A), then there's nothing more to say, but (B)'. This phrase is frequently employed when one wants to politely acknowledge a point made by someone else, even if that point might be absolute or difficult to refute, before subtly introducing one's own opinion or an alternative perspective. It literally translates to 'if it is said to be (A), then that's as far as it goes (in terms of argument/dispute), but (B)'. This demonstrates a sophisticated level of communication, allowing for polite disagreement or a nuanced addition to a conversation.",
