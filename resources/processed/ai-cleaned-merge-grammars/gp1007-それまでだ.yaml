    "etymology": "The expression 「それまでだ」 is a combination of 「それ」 (that), 「まで」 (until), and 「だ」 (the plain form of 「です」, to be). Literally, it signifies 'until that point,' implying that everything leading up to that point becomes meaningless if a certain condition is met.",
    "writeup": "「それまでだ」 is a hypothetical expression indicating that if a certain condition (A) is reached, everything up to that point is in vain. Common translations include \"if (A), then it’s all been in vain,\" \"if (A), then all is a waste,\" or \"if (A), then there’s no point.\" The phrase often appears in sentences with 「ても」 or 「でも」 in the first part, indicating that 'even if (A), if also (B), then there’s no point'.\n\n**Important Consideration:** 「と言われればそれまでだ」 is a set expression meaning 'while it is true that (A), (B),' used to politely express a personal opinion.",
