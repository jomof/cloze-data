    "etymology": "「それまで」 literally means \"until then\" or \"up to that point.\" The addition of 「だ」 transforms it into a declarative statement, indicating that everything is rendered pointless or comes to an end if a certain condition is met.",
    "writeup": "「それまでだ」 is a hypothetical expression used to indicate that if condition A is reached, that's as far as things will go, implying everything up to that point will unfortunately be wasted. Common translations include \"if A, then it's all been in vain,\" \"if A, then all is a waste,\" or \"if A, then there's no point.\" While the standard form uses verbs combined with the conditional particle 「ば」, the conditional particle 「たら」 may occasionally be used.\n\nFrequently, this grammar structure appears in sentences that include 「ても」 or 「でも」 in the first half, with 「ばそれまでだ」 coming closer to the end. This indicates that even if A, if also B, then there's no point.\n\nImportant Consideration: 「と言われればそれまでだ」 is a set expression meaning \"while it is true that A, B,\" or \"although certainly A, B.\" It's often used to politely express one's personal opinion in relation to something. Literally, this phrase means \"if it were to be said that it was A, then that's all there is to it, but B.\"",
