    "etymology": "The phrase 何より is composed of 何 (nani), meaning \"what\" or \"whatever\", and より (yori), meaning \"than\". Thus, the literal translation is \"more than anything.\"",

It's often used to express positive feelings in situations that could have been worse. **何より** can function adverbially at the beginning of a sentence or before the described word. Adding も, as in **何よりも**, strengthens the phrase without significantly changing the nuance.",
