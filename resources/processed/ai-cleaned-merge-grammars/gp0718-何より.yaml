    "etymology": "The phrase 何より is composed of 何 (nani), meaning \"what\" or \"whatever\", and より (yori), meaning \"than\". Thus, the literal translation is \"more than anything.\"",
    "writeup": "**何より** expresses feelings of gladness, relief, or the importance of something above all else. It combines 何 (what) and より (than), literally meaning \"more than anything\". It's often used to express positive feelings in situations that could have been worse. **何より** can function adverbially at the beginning of a sentence or before the described word. Adding も, as in **何よりも**, strengthens the phrase without significantly changing the nuance.",
