    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「も」 originally indicates 'also' or 'too.' When used in the 「も~も」 pattern, it emphasizes the presence or absence of both elements being described.",
    "writeup": "The 「も~も」 grammar pattern is used to express that two things are true or exist, or that neither of two things is true or exists. It creates a sense of balance or parallelism between the two elements. The pattern can be used with verbs, nouns, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives, each having a slightly different construction.\n\n*   **Verbs**: The ます-stem of the verb is followed by 「も」. For example, 「読みも書きもする」 (both read and write) or 「読みも書きもしない」 (neither read nor write). Variations using 「～し」 or conditional forms like 「～すれば」 can also be integrated, such as 「読みもするし、書きもする」 (reads and also writes).\n*   **Nouns**: The noun is directly followed by 「も」. For example, 「料理も掃除もする」 (both cook and clean) or 「料理も掃除もしない」 (neither cook nor clean).\n*   **い-adjectives**: The い ending is dropped and replaced with 「く」, followed by 「も」. For example, 「うれしくも悲しくもある」 (both happy and sad) or 「うれしくも悲しくもない」 (neither happy nor sad).\n*   **な-adjectives/Nouns**: Add 「で」 after the stem or noun, followed by 「も」. For example, 「便利でも経済的でもある」 (both convenient and economical) or 「便利でも経済的でもない」 (neither convenient nor economical). Similar to verbs, forms like 「便利でもあり、経済的でもある」 (is convenient and also economical) can be used.\n\nThis pattern is versatile and adds nuance to your Japanese expressions, allowing you to convey a balanced or comprehensive perspective, emphasizing that the predicate applies equally to both mentioned items, either affirmatively or negatively.",
