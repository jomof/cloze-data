    "etymology": "The grammar point 「からある」 is derived from 「から」 (from) and 「ある」 (to exist). It suggests the existence of something starting from a certain quantity or amount.",
    "writeup": "「からある」 is a formal expression used to indicate a minimum estimated quantity or amount. It's similar to 「からする」, but instead of indicating the value *from* which something is priced, 「からある」 indicates that something *exists from* a certain value. It's often used with numbers and counters to describe things like distances, sizes, weights, or the number of items, implying \"at least\" or \"as many as.\" Following the standard rules of いる and ある, いる will need to be used if something living is being counted; however, this is not a common use of this grammar structure, with からの almost always being used in place of からいる for counting living things. This structure is generally found in more formal contexts.",
