        "usage-context": "This expression is primarily used in formal written contexts, such as literature, newspaper articles, or academic papers. It can also appear in very formal or dramatic speech. It describes a situation where an action is on the very verge of occurring, or a state is so intense it's almost overwhelming. It is often employed to convey a sense of exaggeration, strong emotion, or near-certainty of an extreme outcome.",
        "nuance": "The distinctive feature of 「んばかりに」 is its use of the negative stem of the verb (e.g., 行かぬ, 泣かん), yet it paradoxically expresses an imminent or extreme positive action. This creates a powerful, often hyperbolic, sense of an overwhelming state or impending action. It adds a dramatic or literary flair, emphasizing the degree to which something is about to happen or is felt. The particle 「に」 makes it adverbial, while 「の」 allows it to modify a noun, and 「だ/だった」 makes it a declarative statement."
    },
    "etymology": "The 「ん」 in 「んばかり」 is a remnant of the classical Japanese negative auxiliary verb 「む」 (which later evolved into 「ん」), used here to form a negative stem. 「ばかり」 is a particle meaning \"only,\" \"about,\" or \"on the verge of.\" The combination, though literally meaning something akin to \"almost not doing X,\" has evolved to convey the actual meaning of \"as if something were about to happen\" or \"to the point of almost doing X.\" This peculiar historical development gives it its unique, emphatic nuance.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「んばかりに」 is a sophisticated expression used to convey that a situation is on the very brink of occurring, or that an action is being performed with such intensity that it appears to be on the verge of an extreme outcome. It is largely found in formal writing, literature, and elevated speech, adding a dramatic or emphatic flair to descriptions.\n\nWhile the preceding verb takes its negative stem (e.g., 行く becomes 行かん, 食べる becomes 食べん), the meaning is counter-intuitive: it signifies that the action is *so close* to happening that it feels as if it *will* happen, rather than *not* happen. This peculiar negative construction to express an impending positive action is a key characteristic of 「んばかりに」.\n\nIt can function adverbially, describing *how* an action is performed, or adjectivally when followed by 「の」 to modify a noun. It can also stand alone at the end of a clause with 「だ」 or 「だった」 to make a declarative statement about the near-imminent state. The nuance often carries a sense of overflowing emotion, overwhelming force, or an exaggerated description of a state.",

The scene highlights the internal fervor and readiness to act."
