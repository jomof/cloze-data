    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ならまだしも」 is composed of 「なら」 (if), 「まだ」 (still), and 「しも」, an adverbial particle. 「しも」 is derived from classical Japanese and emphasizes the word preceding it, in this case, 「まだ」. The phrase conveys the nuance that while one situation might be acceptable, another is not.",
    "writeup": "「ならまだしも」 combines 「なら」 (if), 「まだ」 (still), and the adverbial particle 「しも」, which strengthens the preceding word. It expresses that while situation A might be acceptable, situation B is not. It's often translated as \"(A) is fine, but not (B)\" or \"If it's (A), then it's okay, but not (B).\" 「ならまだしも」 often separates the first and second halves of a sentence, marking the acceptable statement (A). 「しも」, a classical particle, isn't commonly used in modern Japanese outside set phrases like 「ならまだしも」, 「今しも」 (right this moment), and 「だれしも」 (absolutely anybody). In all cases, it emphasizes the word before it.",
