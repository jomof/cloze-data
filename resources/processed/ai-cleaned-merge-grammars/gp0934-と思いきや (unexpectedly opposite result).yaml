  unexpectedly.
pronunciation:
  katakana: トオモイキヤ
  romaji: to omoikiya
formation:
  '[Sentence in plain form] + と思いきや': Used to express surprise or unexpected results contrary to one's
    initial thought or expectation.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: general
  function: Expresses a strong contrast between an initial expectation and an unexpected reality.
  nuance: Highlights the speaker's surprise and the dramatic shift from what was anticipated.
etymology: The expression 「と思いきや」 is derived from 「と」 (case-marking particle), 「思い」 (conjunctive form
  of the verb 「思う」, 'to think'), 「き」 (classical auxiliary verb indicating past tense), and 「や」 (classical
  binding particle marking questions). Literally, it translates to something like 'I thought it *had*
  been (A), but I guess (B)'.
writeup: The phrase 「と思いきや」 is a versatile expression used to convey that a situation turned out to be
  contrary to what was initially expected or thought. It captures a sense of surprise or unexpectedness,
  often translating to phrases like 'despite having thought X, Y happened' or 'just when I thought X,
  Y unexpectedly occurred.' The core function is to highlight a stark contrast between an initial assumption
  or expectation and the surprising reality that unfolds. This expression is particularly effective when
  the speaker wants to emphasize their personal astonishment or the dramatic twist of events. Grammatically,
  「と思いきや」 follows a verb, adjective, or noun phrase in its plain form. The first part of the sentence
  (before 「と思いきや」) expresses the speaker's initial thought or expectation, while the second part describes
  the unexpected reality. It is important to note that the second clause, describing the actual situation,
  will almost always be in a past tense or convey a completed action, as it represents a realization or
  an outcome that has already occurred. While its origins lie in classical Japanese—combining the particle
  「と」 (quotative), the conjunctive form 「思い」 (from 思う, 'to think'), the classical past tense auxiliary
  「き」, and the rhetorical particle 「や」—in modern Japanese, 「と思いきや」 functions as a set phrase emphasizing
  the speaker's surprise at an unpredicted outcome. Although the particle 「か」 can sometimes precede 「と思いきや」,
  it merely adds further rhetorical emphasis to the inherent questioning nature of 「や」, without significantly
  altering the meaning.

  - term: かと思ったら・かと思うと
    meaning: Then again, Just when I thought, No sooner than
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「と思いきや」, 「かと思ったら」/「かと思うと」 can describe a change or transition that happens quickly
      after an initial thought or observation, not necessarily a contradiction.
    grammar_point: かと思ったら・かと思うと (unexpected succession)
  - term: ところが
    meaning: However; but; unexpectedly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「と思いきや」 focuses on the speaker's surprise at an outcome contrary to their explicit initial
      thought, 「ところが」 serves as a conjunction to introduce an unexpected or contrasting development without
      necessarily implying a prior internal thought or assumption.
    grammar_point: ところが (unexpected contrast)
  - term: どころか
    meaning: Far from; anything but; let alone
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どころか」 strongly negates the preceding statement and implies a more extreme or opposite reality.
      Unlike 「と思いきや」, which describes a surprising shift from expectation, 「どころか」 often dismisses the
      initial idea as utterly untrue or inadequate, asserting an outright contrary state.
    grammar_point: どころか (far from)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「と思いきや」 vividly captures the speaker's surprise at an outcome that is
  directly opposite to their initial expectation, other expressions convey similar notions of contrast
  or unexpectedness with nuanced differences. 「かと思ったら・かと思うと」 often describes a rapid sequence of events
  where the second event, while perhaps unexpected, isn't necessarily a direct contradiction of the first
  thought. It's more about "just when X, then Y." In contrast, 「ところが」 introduces a simple, sometimes surprising,
  divergence from what might have been assumed, acting as a general 'however' for unexpected turns. 「どころか」,
  on the other hand, is a stronger negation, asserting that the reality is 'far from' or 'anything but'
  the initial idea, often implying an even more extreme opposite. When emphasizing the reversal of a personal
  thought and the surprise that entails, 「と思いきや」 is the most precise choice. Use 「ところが」 for a general
  unexpected development, and 「どころか」 for a stark, often negative, refutation of a preceding statement.
examples:
  - english: I thought it would rain all day today, but in the afternoon, it cleared up beautifully.
    japanese:
      - 今日 は 一 日 中 雨 だろう {と 思 いき や}、午後 に は 見事 に 晴れ上がっ た。
      - 今日 は 一 日 中 雨 だろう {と 思 いき や}、午後 に は 見事 に 晴れ上がり まし た。
    english_literally: Today, all day rain would probably be, having thought that, but in the afternoon,
      beautifully cleared up.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 一 日 中 雨 だろう と 思っ て い {た が}、午後 に は 見事 に 晴れ上がっ た。
        english: I thought it would rain all day today, but in the afternoon, it cleared up beautifully.
        hint: While this also expresses a contrast, 「～と 思 っ て い た が」 conveys a general 'but' or 'however'
          without the strong emphasis on the speaker's surprise or the unexpectedness of the outcome that
          「と思いきや」 provides. We're looking for an expression that highlights the unexpected turnaround.
    scene: A person recounting a pleasant weather surprise.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「だろう」 indicates a strong initial assumption about the weather. The unexpected clear-up
      is then sharply contrasted by 「と思いきや」, creating a sense of pleasant surprise often shared in general
      conversation.
    etymology: The term 「見事」 (migoto) to describe something 'beautiful' or 'splendid' has roots in describing
      things that are worthy of being 'seen' (見る, miru) or 'inspected' (御事, o-goto). Here, it emphasizes
      the impressive nature of the clearing weather.
  - english: I thought the meeting would become chaotic once he arrived, but it proceeded surprisingly
      smoothly.
    japanese:
      - 彼 が 来 たら 会議 は 紛糾 する だろう {と 思 いき や}、意外 に も スムーズ に 進行 し た。
      - 彼 が 来 たら 会議 は 紛糾 する だろう {と 思 いき や}、意外 に も スムーズ に 進行 し まし た。
    english_literally: He arrives if, meeting chaos would probably be, having thought that, but surprisingly,
      smoothly proceeded.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 来 たら 会議 は 紛糾 する だろう と 思っ て い {た が}、意外 に も スムーズ に 進行 し た。
        english: I thought the meeting would become chaotic once he arrived, but it proceeded surprisingly
          smoothly.
        hint: 「～と 思 っ て い た が」 expresses a simple contrast between an expectation and a reality, but it
          does not carry the same degree of speaker's surprise or the sense of an unexpected reversal
          as 「と思いきや」. We need a phrase that emphasizes the outcome was the opposite of what was anticipated.
    scene: Colleagues discussing a difficult team member after a meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The speaker uses 「だろう」 to express a firm, almost certain expectation about the meeting's outcome.
      The use of 「意外 に も」 strengthens the surprise, and 「と思いきや」 provides a formal, slightly dramatic contrast,
      suitable for a professional setting.
    etymology: The word 「紛糾」 (funkkyuu) meaning 'complication' or 'disorder' literally combines characters
      for 'tangle' (紛) and 'twist' (糾), vividly describing a chaotic situation.
  - english: I always thought she was just a serious student, but it seems she's passionately rocking
      out at concerts on weekends.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は いつ も 真面目 な 学生 だ と ばかり {と 思 いき や}、週末 は ロック コンサート で 熱狂 し て いる らしい。
      - 彼女 は いつ も 真面目 な 学生 だ と ばかり {と 思 いき や}、週末 は ロック コンサート で 熱狂 し て いる よう だ。
    english_literally: She always serious student only, having thought that, but weekend is rock concert
      at passionately rocking out seems.

        english: She is always a serious student, but it seems she's passionately rocking out at concerts
          on weekends.
        hint: Using a simple conjunction like 「～だが」 (but) connects two contrasting facts without emphasizing
          the speaker's surprise or the unexpected contradiction between an initial belief and the reality.
          「と思いきや」 is specifically for when the reality is the opposite of what one thought.
    scene: Two friends talking about a classmate's surprising hobby.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The speaker's initial, firm belief is strengthened by 「だ とばかり」, making the following revelation
      with 「と思いきや」 more impactful and conversational among friends. The shared surprise is implied.
    etymology: 「熱狂」 (nekkyou) combines 「熱」 (netsu, heat/passion) and 「狂」 (kyou, madness/enthusiasm), creating
      a vivid image of passionate excitement.
  - english: I thought the new product announcement would proceed smoothly, but at the last minute, a
      shocking postponement was announced.
    japanese:
      - 新 製品 の 発表 は 順調 に 進む {と 思 いき や}、直前 に なっ て まさか の 延期 が 発表 さ れ た。
      - 新 製品 の 発表 は 順調 に 進む {と 思 いき や}、直前 に なっ て まさか の 延期 が 発表 さ れ まし た。
    english_literally: New product's announcement smoothly proceed would, having thought that, but just
      before, shocking postponement was announced.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新 製品 の 発表 は 順調 に 進む はず だっ{た の に}、直前 に なっ て まさか の 延期 が 発表 さ れ た。
        english: The new product announcement was supposed to proceed smoothly, but a shocking postponement
          was announced at the last minute.
        hint: 「～はずだったのに」 expresses disappointment that something didn't happen as expected, or that a
          plan didn't materialize. However, it doesn't carry the same nuance of personal surprise or the
          abrupt reversal of expectation as 「と思いきや」. We need to emphasize the unexpected contradiction.
    scene: A product development team meeting where unexpected news breaks.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The phrase 「まさか の 延期」 (masaka no enki, shocking postponement) amplifies the unexpectedness,
      making 「と思いきや」 particularly fitting. This expression emphasizes the dramatic and surprising reversal
      of expectations in a professional context.
    etymology: 「まさか」 (masaka) derived from the classical 「まことし」 (makotoshi, truly, really) combined with
      a negative implication, evolved to express 'unexpectedly' or 'impossible'. It underscores the disbelief
      at the announcement.
  - english: I thought my child had cleaned up their toys, so I was about to praise them, but it turned
      out they had just hidden them.
    japanese:
      - 子供 が おもちゃ を 片付け た から 褒め て あげよう {と 思 いき や}、実 は 隠し て あっ た だけ だっ た。
      - 子供 が おもちゃ を 片付け た から 褒め て あげよう {と 思 いき や}、実 は 隠し て あっ た だけ だ。

      only were.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 が おもちゃ を 片付け た から 褒め て あげよう と 思っ て い {たら}、実 は 隠し て あっ た だけ だっ た。
        english: I thought my child had cleaned up their toys, and just as I was about to praise them,
          it turned out they had just hidden them.
        hint: 「～と 思 っ て い たら」 indicates that something happened while or immediately after one was thinking.
          It conveys discovery but lacks the strong sense of contradiction and surprise at the *opposite*
          outcome that 「と思いきや」 emphasizes. We need to convey the unexpected twist.
    scene: A parent discovering their child's clever trick.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    nuance: The speaker's initial intent to praise, conveyed by 「褒め て あげよう」, highlights a parent's perspective.
      The subsequent realization of the hidden toys shifts the tone to mild amusement, typical of a parent-child
      interaction, emphasized by 「と思いきや」.
    etymology: The verb 「隠す」 (kakusu), meaning 'to hide', is often used humorously in parent-child interactions
      when children try to avoid chores.
  - english: The plane was supposed to depart on time, but due to bad weather, a three-hour delay was
      announced.
    japanese:
      - 飛行 機 は 定刻 通り に 出発 する {と 思 いき や}、悪 天候 の ため 3 時間 の 遅延 が 決定 し た。
      - 飛行 機 は 定刻 通り に 出発 する {と 思 いき や}、悪 天候 の ため 3 時間 の 遅延 が 決定 し まし た。

      delay was decided.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 飛行 機 は 定刻 通り に 出発 する と 思っ て い た。{しかし}、悪 天候 の ため 3 時間 の 遅延 が 決定 し た。
        english: The plane was supposed to depart on time. However, due to bad weather, a three-hour delay
          was announced.
        hint: Using 「しかし」 (however) simply indicates a contrasting piece of information. It doesn't convey
          the sense of personal surprise or the abrupt reversal of expectations that 「と思いきや」 emphasizes.
          We're looking for an expression that highlights the unexpected turnaround.
    scene: A traveler experiencing an unexpected delay at the airport.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: The expectation of an on-time departure is abruptly shattered by the delay, a common source
      of frustration. 「と思いきや」 effectively conveys this sudden disappointment. The phrase 「定刻 通り」 (teikoku
      doori, on schedule) enhances the sense of a broken expectation.
    etymology: 「遅延」 (chien) combines 「遅」 (chi, late) and 「延」 (en, extend), literally meaning 'extended
      lateness', precisely describing a delay.
  - english: I thought he would fail since it was his first time, but he pulled it off brilliantly, surprising
      everyone.
    japanese:

      - 初めて の 経験 だ から 失敗 する だろう {と 思 いき や}、彼 は 見事 に 成功 さ せ て 皆 を 驚か せ まし た。

      splendidly succeeded and everyone surprised.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 初めて の 経験 だ から 失敗 する だろう {が}、彼 は 見事 に 成功 さ せ て 皆 を 驚か せ た。
        english: Because it was his first time, he would probably fail, but he pulled it off brilliantly,
          surprising everyone.
        hint: A simple 「～が」 (but) merely introduces a contrasting idea. It lacks the strong implication
          of the speaker's surprise and the sense that the reality is the exact opposite of what was expected,
          which is conveyed by 「と思いきや」. We need to express a sense of unexpected reversal.
    scene: Observing a new team member's unexpectedly brilliant performance.
    register: formal
    setting: supportive
    nuance: The initial doubt, expressed with 「失敗 する だろう」, sets up a strong contrast with the brilliant
      success, conveyed by 「見事 に 成功 さ せ て」. 「と思いきや」 highlights this unexpected triumph, suitable for a
      formal and supportive observation.
    etymology: The word 「見事」 (migoto), also seen in Example 1, emphasizes the admirable and splendid nature
      of his success, implying it was something impressive to behold.
  - english: I thought that shop would have few customers because it's small and unassuming, but it turned
      out to be a popular place that's always full and requires reservations.

      always full seats with reservation required popular shop was.

          - あの 店 は 小さく て 目立た ない から お 客 さん が 少ない と 思っ て い まし {た が}、いつ も 満席 で 予約 必須 の 人気 店 だっ た。
        english: I thought that shop would have few customers because it's small and unassuming, but it
          turned out to be a popular place that's always full and requires reservations.
        hint: While 「～と 思 っ て い まし た が」 conveys a general contrast, it doesn't carry the strong emotional
          impact of surprise or the sense of the opposite happening that 「と思いきや」 does. We need to emphasize
          the unexpected nature of the discovery.
    scene: Discovering a hidden gem restaurant that defies expectations.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: The speaker's surprise at the shop's unexpected popularity, despite its unassuming appearance,
      is a common informal observation. 「と思いきや」 aptly captures this reversal of initial judgment. 「予約
      必須」 (yoyaku hissu, reservation required) is a casual way to emphasize its popularity.
    etymology: 「満席」 (manseki) literally means 'full seats', combining 「満」 (man, full) and 「席」 (seki, seat),
      a common term for a fully occupied venue.
  - english: I thought she was always expressionless and unapproachable, but when I talked to her, I found
      she was very kind and easy to talk to.

      - 彼女 は いつ も 無 表情 で とっつき にくい 人 {と 思 いき や}、話し て み たら とても 優しく て 話し やすい 人 でし た。

          - 彼女 は いつ も 無 表情 で とっつき にくい 人 だ と 思っ て い {たら}、話し て み たら とても 優しく て 話し やすい 人 だっ た。
        english: I thought she was always expressionless and unapproachable, and when I tried talking
          to her, I found she was very kind and easy to talk to.
        hint: 「～と 思 っ て い たら」 suggests that something happened while or immediately after one was thinking.
          It conveys a discovery, but not necessarily a strong contradiction or surprise that the reality
          was the exact opposite of the initial thought, which is what 「と思いきや」 expresses. We need to emphasize
          the unexpected contrast.
    scene: Someone overcoming shyness to interact with a new colleague.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker (female) uses 「とっつきにくい」 to describe the initial, somewhat reserved impression
      of the listener (female). The phrase 「話し て み たら」 indicates the personal effort made to connect,
      and the subsequent discovery of kindness with 「とても 優しく て 話し やすい」 reflects a more intimate, female-to-female
      observation of personality, contrasted by 「と思いきや」.
    etymology: 「とっつき にくい」 (tottsuki nikui) literally means 'hard to grab onto' (掴む, tsukamu), metaphorically
      indicating someone who is unapproachable or hard to get close to.
  - english: I thought party A would have an overwhelming advantage in the public opinion polls, but the
      election results showed that party B unexpectedly secured a victory.
    japanese:
      - 世論 調査 で は 圧倒 的 に A 党 が 有利 {と 思 いき や}、選挙 結果 は まさか の B 党 が 勝利 を 収め た。
      - 世論 調査 で は 圧倒 的 に A 党 が 有利 {と 思 いき や}、選挙 結果 は まさか の B 党 が 勝利 を 収め まし た。
    english_literally: Public opinion poll in overwhelmingly Party A advantageous, having thought that,
      but election results shockingly Party B victory achieved.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 世論 調査 で は 圧倒 的 に A 党 が 有利 だっ た。{ところ が}、選挙 結果 は まさか の B 党 が 勝利 を 収め た。
        english: Party A had an overwhelming advantage in the public opinion polls. However, the election
          results unexpectedly showed Party B securing a victory.
        hint: 「ところが」 introduces an unexpected turn of events, but it doesn't necessarily emphasize the
          speaker's prior strong belief or the complete contradiction of that belief, as 「と思いきや」 does.
          「と思いきや」 specifically highlights the surprise that something *opposite* happened.
    scene: Political analysts discussing unexpected election outcomes.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The political context and the strong initial expectation indicated by 「圧倒的 に 有利」 (attouteki
      ni yuuri, overwhelmingly advantageous) make the surprising election outcome a dramatic contradiction.
      「と思いきや」 perfectly conveys this sense of shock and unexpectedness in a formal, analytical discussion.
    etymology: 「まさか」 (masaka), as noted previously, is crucial here to emphasize the sheer improbability
      of the outcome against all prior indications, making the reversal truly shocking.
  - english: I thought stock prices would continue to fall, but they showed a V-shaped recovery due to
      sudden positive news.
    japanese:
      - 株価 は 下落 する 一方 だろう {と 思 いき や}、突然 の 好 材料 で V 字 回復 を 見せ た。
      - 株価 は 下落 する 一方 だろう {と 思 いき や}、突然 の 好 材料 で V 字 回復 を 見せ まし た。
    english_literally: Stock prices fall one way would probably, having thought that, but sudden good
      news by V-shape recovery showed.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 株価 は 下落 する 一方 だろう と 思っ て い {た が}、突然 の 好 材料 で V 字 回復 を 見せ た。
        english: I thought stock prices would continue to fall, but they showed a V-shaped recovery due
          to sudden positive news.
        hint: Using 「～と 思 っ て い た が」 (I thought X, but Y) indicates a general contrast between an expectation
          and a reality. However, it lacks the strong sense of surprise and the emphasis on the outcome
          being the exact opposite of what was anticipated, which 「と思いきや」 provides. We need to highlight
          the unexpected, contradictory turnaround.
    scene: Investors reacting to sudden, positive market changes.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The phrase 「下落 する 一方 だろう」 (geraku suru ippou darou, would only fall) suggests a strong, almost
      inevitable downward trend. 「と思いきや」 highlights the dramatic and unforeseen reversal by 「V 字 回復」 (V-ji
      kaifuku, V-shaped recovery), common in financial news.
    etymology: 「一方」 (ippou) literally means 'one side/direction', and when used with a verb in the pattern
      'Verb + 一方だ', it means 'to continue to do X' or 'to do nothing but X'.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「と思いきや」 consistently highlights a sharp contrast between
  an initial, often strong, expectation and a completely unexpected, sometimes opposite, reality. The
  preceding clause is always in plain form, reflecting the thought or assumption. The variety in registers
  and settings demonstrates its versatility in expressing surprise across different communication contexts.
