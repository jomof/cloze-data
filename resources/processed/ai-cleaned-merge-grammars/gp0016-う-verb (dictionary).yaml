        "colocation": "Often followed by particles like の, こと, or ばかり to form nominalized clauses or specific grammatical patterns. Can be directly followed by explanatory particle の (のだ/んです) or used in conditional clauses.",

        "spatial-flow": "Not directly related to spatial flow, but the action described by the verb may occur in a specific space or direction, as indicated by accompanying particles or context, e.g., 行く (iku - to go) implying movement towards a location or 来る (kuru - to come) implying movement towards the speaker's location, etc. However, the dictionary form itself does not inherently dictate spatial flow. It is the core action or state of the verb in its most basic form.",

    "etymology": "The term 「う-verb」 refers to verbs that end with a 「う」 sound in their dictionary form. The 「dictionary form (辞書形)」 is so-called because it is the form in which the verb appears in a dictionary.",
    "writeup": "う-Verbs encompass all Japanese verbs ending in う sounds, including some ending in る. These are termed Godan (五段, \"five-level\") verbs because their conjugations utilize all five sounds within the same column (段) as their base form.\n\nFor instance, the dictionary form is the entry form you find in a dictionary and serves as the base for all other conjugations. It is commonly used in casual speech, non-past clauses, relative clauses, and as a component in various compound structures.\n\nHere are some examples of Godan verb conjugations to illustrate the \"five-level\" principle, using 聞く (kiku - to listen/hear) as an example:\n\n*   聞(か)ない (negative plain)\n*   聞(き)ます (non-past polite)\n*   聞(く) (dictionary form)\n*   聞(け)る (potential)\n*   聞(こ)う (volitional)\n\nAs you can see, the base sound shifts (e.g., か, き, く, け, こ) depending on the conjugation, demonstrating the fundamental characteristic of う-verbs.",
