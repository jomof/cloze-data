        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Used as the basic, unconjugated form of a verb. It serves as the base for many other conjugations and is commonly found in dictionaries, hence its name.",
        "function": "To indicate a verb's fundamental meaning without specifying tense or politeness level.",
        "nuance": "The dictionary form is considered the 'plain' or 'casual' form, appropriate for informal conversation, internal monologues, or as a component of larger grammatical structures.",
        "source": "Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) N5 curriculum; general Japanese linguistics.",
        "counterpoint": "Contrasts with polite forms (e.g., -ます form) and formal conjugations. It is distinct from the stem or te-form in its grammatical function.",
        "colocation": "Often followed by particles like の, こと, or ばかり to form nominalized clauses or specific grammatical patterns. Can be directly followed by explanatory particle の (のだ/んです) or used in conditional clauses.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as the base form for all verb conjugations, appearing as the primary entry in dictionaries. Used in plain speech for non-past statements, relative clauses, and as a component in various compound structures.",
        "logical-flow": "Serves as the foundational element from which logical extensions of tense, mood, and politeness are built. Represents the core action or state.",
        "temporal-flow": "Typically denotes non-past actions or states, including habitual actions, future plans, or general truths, unless combined with other grammatical elements to indicate past tense.",
        "spatial-flow": "Not directly related to spatial flow, but the action described by the verb may occur in a specific space or direction, as indicated by accompanying particles or context, e.g., 行く (iku - to go) implying movement towards a location or 来る (kuru - to come) implying movement towards the speaker's location, etc. However, the dictionary form itself does not inherently dictate spatial flow. It is the core action or state of the verb in its most basic form."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「う-verb」 refers to verbs that end with a 「う」 sound in their dictionary form. The 「dictionary form (辞書形)」 is so-called because it is the form in which the verb appears in a dictionary.",
    "writeup": "う-Verbs encompass all Japanese verbs ending in う sounds, including some ending in る. These are termed Godan (五段, \"five-level\") verbs because their conjugations utilize all five sounds within the same column (段) as their base form.\n\nFor instance, in the example 聞く, the く changes to き when conjugated to the polite form, 聞きます. All sounds in the K-column will be used with 聞く depending on the conjugation. The same principle applies to all う-Verbs:\n\n*   聞(か)ない (negative)\n*   聞(き)たい (desire)\n*   聞(く) (dictionary)\n*   聞(け)る (potential)\n*   聞(こ)う (volitional)\n\nHere we can see the う-Verb 聞く using all of the different K-column sounds in various conjugations.\n\nThe dictionary form, also known as the plain form or casual form, is fundamental. It is the form you find in a dictionary and is used in casual speech, non-past clauses, relative clauses, and as a base for many other conjugations.",
