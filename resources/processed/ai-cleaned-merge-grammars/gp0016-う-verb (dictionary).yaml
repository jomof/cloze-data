details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used as the basic, unconjugated form of a verb. It serves as the base for many other
    conjugations and is commonly found in dictionaries, hence its name.
  function: To indicate a verb's fundamental meaning without specifying tense or politeness level.
  nuance: The dictionary form is considered the 'plain' or 'casual' form, appropriate for informal conversation,
    internal monologues, or as a component of larger grammatical structures.
  counterpoint: Contrasts with polite forms (e.g., -ます form) and formal conjugations. It is distinct from
    the stem or te-form in its grammatical function.
  colocation: Often followed by particles like の, こと, or ばかり to form nominalized clauses or specific grammatical
    patterns. Can be directly followed by explanatory particle の (のだ/んです) or used in conditional clauses.
  grammatical-role: Functions as the base form for all verb conjugations, appearing as the primary entry
    in dictionaries. Used in plain speech for non-past statements, relative clauses, and as a component
    in various compound structures.
  logical-flow: Serves as the foundational element from which logical extensions of tense, mood, and politeness
    are built. Represents the core action or state.
  temporal-flow: Typically denotes non-past actions or states, including habitual actions, future plans,
    or general truths, unless combined with other grammatical elements to indicate past tense.
  spatial-flow: Not directly related to spatial flow, but the action described by the verb may occur in
    a specific space or direction, as indicated by accompanying particles or context, e.g., 行く (iku -
    to go) implying movement towards a location or 来る (kuru - to come) implying movement towards the speaker's
    location, etc. However, the dictionary form itself does not inherently dictate spatial flow. It is
    the core action or state of the verb in its most basic form.
etymology: The term 「う-verb」 refers to verbs that end with a 「う」 sound in their dictionary form. The 「dictionary
  form (辞書形)」 is so-called because it is the form in which the verb appears in a dictionary.
writeup: |-
  う-Verbs encompass all Japanese verbs ending in う sounds, including some ending in る. These are termed Godan (五段, "five-level") verbs because their conjugations utilize all five sounds within the same column (段) as their base form.

  For instance, the dictionary form is the entry form you find in a dictionary and serves as the base for all other conjugations. It is commonly used in casual speech, non-past clauses, relative clauses, and as a component in various compound structures.

  Here are some examples of Godan verb conjugations to illustrate the "five-level" principle, using 聞く (kiku - to listen/hear) as an example:

  *   聞(か)ない (negative plain)
  *   聞(き)ます (non-past polite)
  *   聞(く) (dictionary form)
  *   聞(け)る (potential)
  *   聞(こ)う (volitional)

  As you can see, the base sound shifts (e.g., か, き, く, け, こ) depending on the conjugation, demonstrating the fundamental characteristic of う-verbs.
false_friends:
  - term: る-verbs (ichidan verbs)
    meaning: Dictionary form (present/future tense) of a る-verb (Ichidan verb).
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike う-verbs, る-verbs (Ichidan verbs) have a simpler and more regular conjugation pattern
      as their stem does not change when conjugating, making them appear similar in dictionary form but
      fundamentally different in conjugation behavior.
    grammar_point: る-verbs (ichidan verbs)
post_false_friends_writeup: When learning verbs, it's crucial to differentiate between う-verbs (Godan
  verbs) and る-verbs (Ichidan verbs), especially for those ending in る. While both have dictionary forms,
  their conjugation patterns differ significantly. Pay attention to how their stems change (or don't change)
  when conjugating, as this is the key to identifying their type and applying the correct conjugation
  rules.
examples:
  - english: I read Japanese books every day.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 毎日、日本 語 の 本 を {読む}。
      - 毎日、日本 語 の 本 {読む}。
      - 趣味 は 日本 語 の 本 を {読む} こと です。
    english_literally: As for me, every day, Japanese language's books, I read.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 毎日、日本 語 の 本 を {読み ます}。
        english: I read Japanese books every day (polite).
        hint: The casual setting among friends makes the plain form 「読む」 more natural for stating a habitual
          action than the polite 「読みます」. We're looking for a casual expression.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 日本 語 の 本 を {読ん だ} こと が ある。
        english: I have read Japanese books (experience).
        hint: This sentence expresses having the experience of reading. We're looking for a regular, habitual
          action.
    scene: A student casually mentioning their daily study habits to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: This sentence uses the dictionary form 「読む」 to describe a regular, habitual action in a casual
      context. The omission of the topic marker 「は」 and the use of the plain form 「読む」 are typical in
      casual conversation between friends. The phrase 「毎日」 (every day) reinforces the ongoing nature of
      the action. The nuance is a direct and plain statement, common for a male speaker in this context.
  - english: I will write the report by tomorrow.
    japanese:
      - レポート は 明日 まで に {書く}。
      - 明日 まで に レポート {書く} よ。

          - レポート は 明日 まで に {書き ます}。
        english: I will write the report by tomorrow (polite).
        hint: The plain form 「書く」 is used for casual statements of future action. We're looking for a
          casual intent.
      - competing_japanese:
          - レポート は 明日 まで に {書ける}。
        english: I can write the report by tomorrow.
        hint: This emphasizes ability, not a direct statement of future action. We're looking for a simple
          statement of intent to write.
    scene: A university student tells their classmate about their plan to finish an assignment.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The dictionary form 「書く」 conveys a casual statement of future action or intent. The phrase
      「明日 まで に」 sets a clear deadline. It's a straightforward declaration, often used among peers without
      needing formal politeness.
  - english: Learning a language is hard.
    japanese:
      - 言葉 を {話す} の は 難しい。
      - 言葉 を {話す} の って 難しい ね。
      - 外国 語 を {話す} こと は、本当 に 難しい。
    english_literally: As for speaking language, it is difficult.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 言葉 を {話し ます} こと は 難しい。
        english: Speaking a language is difficult (polite).
        hint: The polite form is not typically used for general truths or statements of opinion in everyday
          conversation. We're seeking a general, declarative statement.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 言葉 が {話せ ない}。
        english: I cannot speak languages.
        hint: This expresses a personal inability, not a general observation about the difficulty of language
          learning itself. We're discussing the inherent difficulty of the act.
    scene: Two friends discussing their struggles with language learning over coffee.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Here, 「話す」 is used to nominalize the action of 'speaking' with 「の は」, forming a general statement
      or opinion. The plain form is natural for expressing commonly held beliefs or observations in casual
      conversation. The addition of 「って」 in some variations makes it sound more conversational and seeking
      agreement.
  - english: I plan to buy a new computer next month.
    japanese:
      - 来月、新しい パソコン を {買う} つもり だ。
      - 来月、新しい パソコン {買う} 予定。

          - 来月、新しい パソコン を {買い ます}。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 来月、新しい パソコン を {買える}。
        english: I can buy a new computer next month.
        hint: This emphasizes the ability to buy, not the intent to buy. We're looking for a statement
          about a future plan.
    scene: Someone telling a friend about their upcoming purchase.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male

      casual statement is suitable for conversation with friends or family. The use of 「から さ」 in one variation
      adds a slightly explanatory or reassuring tone.

    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

    nuance: The phrase 「泳ぐ の が 好き だ」 uses the dictionary form 「泳ぐ」 to nominalize the action, expressing
      a general preference or fondness for an activity. This structure is very common for describing hobbies
      or things one likes. The variations show different levels of casualness.

        english: Students must carry their student ID (strong obligation).
        hint: While grammatically correct, 「〜こと」 provides a more concise, rule-like instruction, often
          seen in written notices or direct commands in an authoritative context. We're looking for a

          - 外 で {遊び なさい}！
        english: Please play outside (polite command).

          direct, sometimes slightly impatient, command. The plain dictionary form can function as a strong,
          casual command.

          - 外 で {遊ん で ください}！
        english: Please play outside (polite request).

      - competing_japanese:
          - 誰 も が いつ か は {死に ます}。
        english: Everyone will someday die (polite).
        hint: While grammatically correct, polite forms are less common for expressing universal truths
          or philosophical statements in a general context, where the plain form sounds more declarative

        english: Everyone will someday end up dying.
        hint: This phrase emphasizes the inevitable outcome or result of a process, whereas the dictionary

        english: I want to go home after work.

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female

    english_literally: As for that athlete, very fast, he runs.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 選手 は とても 速く {走り ます}。
        english: That runner runs very fast (polite).
        hint: The casual plain form 「走る」 is suitable for general observation or description among friends,
          whereas the polite form might feel overly formal in this context. We're making a casual observation
          about a general characteristic.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 選手 は {走る} こと が できる。
        english: That runner can run.
        hint: This states the ability to run, not the characteristic of running fast. We're describing
          how they run.
    scene: Two friends watching a sports event and commenting on a participant's performance.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The dictionary form 「走る」 is used to describe a characteristic or habitual action (how the
      runner runs). This declarative use of the plain form is common for making observations or stating
      facts in casual conversation. 「よ」 and 「ん だ」 add slight emphasis or explanatory nuance.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the conjugation patterns of う-verbs is fundamental to Japanese grammar.
  As you've seen, even though the base verb type is constant, the resulting form and its nuances change
  significantly depending on the conjugation. Pay close attention to how each conjugation modifies the
  meaning and the social context of the sentence.
