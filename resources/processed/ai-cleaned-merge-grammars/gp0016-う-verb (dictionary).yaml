    "etymology": "The term 「う-verb」 refers to verbs that end with a 「う」 sound in their dictionary form. The 「dictionary form (辞書形)」 is so-called because it is the form in which the verb appears in a dictionary.",
    "writeup": "う-Verbs encompass all Japanese verbs ending in う sounds, including some ending in る. These are termed Godan (五段, \"five-level\") verbs because their conjugations utilize all five sounds within the same column (段) as their base form.\n\nFor instance, in the example 聞く, the く changes to き when conjugated to the polite form, 聞きます. All sounds in the K-column will be used with 聞く depending on the conjugation. The same principle applies to all う-Verbs:\n\n*   聞(か)ない (negative)\n*   聞(き)たい (desire)\n*   聞(く) (dictionary)\n*   聞(け)る (potential)\n*   聞(こ)う (volitional)\n\nHere we can see the う-Verb 聞く using all of the different K-column sounds in various conjugations.\n\nThe dictionary form, also known as the plain form or casual form, is fundamental. It is the form you find in a dictionary and is used in casual speech, non-past clauses, relative clauses, and as a base for many other conjugations.",
