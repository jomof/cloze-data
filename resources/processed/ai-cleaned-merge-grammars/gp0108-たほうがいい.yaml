    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たほうがいい」 is composed of 「た」 (past tense form of a verb), 「方 (ほう)」 (direction, way), 「が」 (particle), and 「いい」 (good). Literally, it means \"the way you did [verb] is good,\" implying that doing that action is preferable.",
    "writeup": "The 「たほうがいい」 construction is used to give advice or make a suggestion. It carries the nuance that doing something is better than not doing it, and often implies that there may be negative consequences if the advice is not followed. It's a fairly direct expression, so it's important to consider your relationship with the listener. Using 「たほうがいい」 can come across as presumptuous or even rude if used carelessly with someone of higher status or someone you don't know well. In such situations, consider using more polite expressions such as 「方が良い (ほうがよい) 」 or indirect suggestions.",
