id: gp0629
meaning: To order or firmly request (someone of lower status to do something).
meaning_warning: This is a commanding expression.
pronunciation:
  katakana: タマエ
  romaji: tamae
formation:
  Verb[ます-stem] + たまえ: Creates a light order or command, primarily used by men to someone of lower status.
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Primarily used by men addressing someone of visibly lower status or rank. Can also appear
    in archaic or literary contexts for solemn requests or pleas.
  function: To issue a mild order or request, or to express a solemn wish.
  nuance: Carries an authoritative, sometimes slightly old-fashioned, male-centric tone. It is less harsh
    than a plain imperative (～ろ/～せよ) but more direct and less universally polite than ～てください.
  colocation: Often used with honorific prefixes like お～ (o-) or ご～ (go-) when the action itself is being
    honored or when the recipient is being treated with respect despite the command. Common with verbs
    related to movement, speaking, or starting an activity. Can be preceded by phrases like 「さあ」 (come
    on), 「どうぞ」 (please), or 「これを見て」 (look at this).
  grammatical-role: Acts as an imperative auxiliary, forming a compound verb construction. It functions
    as the main predicate of the clause, conveying a direct command.
etymology: The grammar point 「たまえ」 originates from the verb 「給う」 (tamau), an honorific verb meaning "to
  give" or "to bestow". Over time, its imperative form evolved into a way to issue commands or requests,
  primarily from a superior to a subordinate.
writeup: 'The imperative form 「たまえ」 is derived from the classical verb 「給う」 (tamau), which means "to give"
  or "to bestow". When attached to the ます-stem of a verb, 「たまえ」 forms a command or a firm request. Although
  it can sometimes be translated as "please do (A)", it is crucial to understand its specific usage and
  nuance. Usage Context and Register: 「たまえ」 is a highly formal and somewhat stiff expression. It is almost
  exclusively used by men when addressing someone of visibly lower status or rank. This hierarchical relationship
  is typically clear, such as a boss speaking to an employee, a teacher to a student, or an older man
  to a younger one. While it conveys a command, it is generally less harsh than the plain imperative form
  (e.g., 「～しろ」 or 「～せよ」) and maintains a certain level of traditional formality. Historical and Literary
  Use: Historically, 「たまえ」 was also used in more solemn contexts, such as prayers or formal pleas to a
  higher power or a deity. In modern Japanese, this usage is largely confined to classical literature,
  religious texts, or dramatic performances, giving it an archaic or literary feel in such instances.'
false_friends:
  - term: な
    meaning: Don't, Do not (Prohibitive)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「たまえ」, which is an imperative urging action, 「な」 is a prohibitive expression, telling
      someone not to do something.
    grammar_point: な (prohibitive particle)
  - term: なさい
    meaning: Do (polite command)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「たまえ」 and 「～なさい」 are commands given by a superior to a subordinate, 「たまえ」 is generally
      more formal, often used by older men, and can carry a slightly more authoritative or traditional
      nuance. 「～なさい」 is generally softer and more common across genders and ages.
    grammar_point: なさい (polite imperative)
  - term: 命令形
    meaning: Do (plain imperative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The plain imperative forms (e.g., 「～しろ」 or 「～せよ」) are much harsher and more direct than 「たまえ」.
      While 「たまえ」 retains a degree of formality or traditional authority, plain imperatives can sound
      rude or abrupt if not used in appropriate contexts (e.g., military commands, very angry speech).
    grammar_point: 命令形 (imperative form)
  - term: てください
    meaning: Please do (Polite request)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～てください」 is a polite request that can be used by anyone to anyone, regardless of status, and
      lacks the authoritative or male-centric nuance of 「たまえ」. It is a general-purpose request form.
    grammar_point: てください (polite request)
post_false_friends_writeup: When giving commands or making requests, it is important to choose the appropriate
  expression based on the speaker's gender, status relative to the listener, and the desired level of
  formality or directness. 「たまえ」 offers a distinct nuance of male-centric, authoritative instruction,
  contrasting with the softer 「～なさい」, the prohibitive 「な」, or the very direct plain imperative forms.
examples:
  - english: Well then, please step in here.
    japanese:
      - さあ まあ、どうぞ こちら へ お 入り {たまえ}。
      - さあ、どうぞ こちら へ お 入り {たまえ}。
      - どうぞ、こちら へ お 入り {たまえ}。
    english_literally: Come, please enter here.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - さあ まあ、どうぞ こちら へ お 入り {なさい}。
        english: Well then, please step in here.
        hint: While both are commands, 「たまえ」 has a more traditional, male-centric, and slightly more authoritative
          feel, often implying a clear status difference. 「お入りなさい」 is a general polite command that can
          be used by anyone to a subordinate or younger person, without the same strong historical nuance.
          We're looking for a command with a traditional male-centric authority.
    scene: A male senior executive welcoming a junior employee into his office.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「お入りたまえ」 by an older male executive to a junior employee indicates a polite but
      firm instruction, typical of male-centric superior-subordinate interactions. The phrase 「さあ まあ、どうぞ」
      softens the command, making it sound more inviting than a direct order.
    etymology: The honorific prefix 「お」 (o-) before 「入り」 (iri, entering) adds politeness, indicating respect
      for the action or the person to whom the action pertains, despite the commanding nature of 「たまえ」
      itself. This combination is common in formal directions or invitations where both respect and clear
      instruction are needed. 「さあ まあ、どうぞ」 is an interjection used to gently urge or invite someone, often
      implying a slight pause or consideration before action, originating from a combination of the urging
      particle 「さあ」 and the softening particle 「まあ」, followed by the polite invitation 「どうぞ」 (please).
  - english: You seem to be hesitating. Please state your frank opinion.
    japanese:
      - 何 か 迷っ て いる よう だ ね。率直 な 意見 を 述べ {たまえ}。
      - 何 か 迷っ て いる よう です ね。率直 な 意見 を 述べ {たまえ}。
      - 率直 な 意見 を 述べ {たまえ}。
    english_literally: You seem to be lost. Express your frank opinion.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 何 か 迷っ て いる よう だ ね。率直 な 意見 を {述べろ}。
        english: You seem to be hesitating. State your frank opinion!
        hint: The plain imperative 「述べろ」 is much harsher and more direct, almost demanding. 「たまえ」 carries
          an authoritative tone but with a nuance of guidance or encouragement from a superior, suitable
          for a professor. We're looking for an authoritative yet encouraging command.
    scene: A professor addressing a hesitant student during a seminar.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「述べたまえ」 is used by the male professor to encourage the student to speak their mind. While
      it's an imperative, the context implies an encouragement rather than a harsh command, reflecting
      the professor's role in guiding discussion.
    etymology: 「率直」 (socchoku) means 'frank' or 'candid', stemming from 「率」 (sotsu/ritsu, leading/rate)
      and 「直」 (choku/jiki, straight/direct). Its usage here highlights the desire for unadulterated truth.
      「意見」 (iken) means 'opinion', formed from 「意」 (i, meaning/mind) and 「見」 (ken, view/look). The combination
      「率直な意見」 is a common collocation to express a direct and honest viewpoint. The phrase 「～ようだな」 (you
      da na) implies 'it seems that ~', with 「よう」 indicating appearance or state, 「だ」 being the copula,
      and 「な」 acting as a sentence-final particle to express mild assertion or agreement-seeking, common
      in conversational Japanese to soften a direct statement or prompt a response. This combination of
      particles and verb forms creates a nuanced tone of observation followed by encouragement.
  - english: Don't hold back, come on, drink more!
    japanese:
      - 遠慮 せ ず、さあ、もっと 飲み {たまえ}！
      - 遠慮 せ ず、もっと 飲み {たまえ}！
      - もっと 飲み {たまえ}！
    english_literally: Without reserve, come on, drink more!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 遠慮 せ ず、さあ、もっと 飲み {なさい}！
        english: Don't hold back, come on, drink more!
        hint: While both are invitations, 「飲みたまえ」 implies a more traditional, sometimes slightly old-fashioned,
          male-centric authority in offering hospitality. 「飲みなさい」 is a more general polite command often
          used with younger individuals but lacks the specific 'senior male host' nuance. We're looking
          for a warm, authoritative invitation from an older male host.
    scene: An older man hosting a younger guest at his home, offering drinks.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Used by an older male host, 「飲みたまえ」 acts as a warm, authoritative invitation to drink, typical
      of a superior offering hospitality. The phrase 「遠慮せず」 (without holding back) further emphasizes
      the encouraging nature.
    etymology: 「遠慮」 (enryo) means 'reserve' or 'holding back', combining 「遠」 (en, far) and 「慮」 (ryo, consider/thought).
      The expression 「遠慮せず」 (enryo sezu) literally means 'without holding back consideration', urging
      the listener to act freely without hesitation. This phrase often appears in hospitality settings,
      as seen here. 「もっと」 (motto) means 'more', derived from an older form of 'to hold' or 'to possess',
      indicating an increase. Its use here reinforces the idea of encouraging the guest to take more.
      「さあ」 is an interjection used to urge or prompt action, often with a sense of encouragement or invitation.
      This example's use of 「遠慮せず」 along with 「さあ」 and 「たまえ」 creates a strong, yet benevolent, push for
      the guest to feel comfortable and enjoy themselves. The classical particle 「ず」 at the end of 「遠慮せず」
      (the negative form of a verb/adjective) is a remnant of classical Japanese and contributes to the
      slightly formal or literary feel of the expression.
  - english: Lord, save this soul.
    japanese:
      - 主 よ、この 魂 を 救い {たまえ}。
      - 主 よ、この 魂 を お 救い {たまえ}。
    english_literally: Lord, save this soul.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 主 よ、この 魂 を {救え}。
        english: Lord, save this soul!
        hint: 「救え」 is the plain imperative form, which is very direct and lacks the solemn, traditional,
          or literary tone found in 「たまえ」, which is derived from classical Japanese and suited for formal
          entreaties to a higher power. We're looking for a solemn, archaic plea.
    scene: A character in an ancient text praying for salvation.
    register: bungo (literary)
    setting: religious
    nuance: 「救いたまえ」 is a classical, archaic usage, often found in religious texts or formal pleas to a
      higher power. It conveys a solemn request or wish.
    etymology: 「主」 (shu) meaning 'Lord' or 'master' is often used in religious contexts to refer to a
      deity. The particle 「よ」 (yo) after 「主」 is a vocative particle, used to call out to someone or something,
      similar to 'O' or 'Thou' in archaic English. This usage is common in prayers, poetry, and classical
      texts. 「魂」 (tamashii) means 'soul' or 'spirit', often having spiritual or philosophical connotations.
      The verb 「救う」 (sukuu) means 'to save' or 'to rescue', and in this context, it refers to spiritual
      salvation. This example demonstrates 「たまえ」 in its most archaic and solemn usage, highlighting its
      historical role in formal entreaties to a higher power, far removed from everyday conversation.
  - english: You, what are you doing! Get to that work immediately!
    japanese:
      - 君、何 を し て いる！すぐ に その 仕事 に 取りかかり {たまえ}！
      - 君、何 を し てる ん だ！すぐ に その 仕事 に 取りかかり {たまえ}！
      - すぐ に その 仕事 に 取りかかり {たまえ}！
    english_literally: You, what are you doing! Immediately begin that work!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 君、何 を し て いる！すぐ に その 仕事 に {取りかかれ}！
        english: You, what are you doing! Immediately begin that work!
        hint: While 「取りかかれ」 is a direct command, 「たまえ」 maintains a level of formality and traditional
          authority, often used by a superior in a way that is firm but not necessarily rude. The plain
          imperative 「取りかかれ」 can sound much harsher and less refined in a professional setting. We're
          looking for a firm, authoritative command from a boss that retains some formality.
    scene: A strict male boss finding an employee slacking off.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「取りかかりたまえ」 is a sharp, commanding imperative from an older male boss to a subordinate, suitable
      for expressing displeasure and demanding immediate action. The use of 「君」 (you) also underscores
      the direct and hierarchical address.
    etymology: 「君」 (kimi) is a second-person pronoun that implies a relationship of superiority (speaker
      to listener) or familiarity. In this context, it's used by a superior addressing a subordinate,
      reinforcing the hierarchical relationship. 「取りかかる」 (torikakaru) means 'to set about', 'to begin',
      or 'to start (work)', combining 「取る」 (toru, to take) and 「かかる」 (kakaru, to hang/to be about to do).
      The phrasing 「何をしている！」 (nani wo shite iru!) is an interrogative exclamation, literally 'What are
      you doing!', used to express strong disapproval or surprise at someone's actions. 「すぐに」 (sugu ni)
      means 'immediately' or 'right away', emphasizing the urgency of the command. This combination of
      direct address, rhetorical question, and an urgent command creates a very strong and authoritative
      tone typical of a strict boss.
  - english: What about your homework? Start right now.
    japanese:
      - 宿題 は どう し た？今 すぐ 始め {たまえ}。
      - 宿題 は どう なっ て いる？今 すぐ 始め {たまえ}。
      - 今 すぐ 始め {たまえ}。
    english_literally: Homework, how is it? Now immediately begin.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 宿題 は どう し た？今 すぐ 始め {なさい}。
        english: What about your homework? Start right now.
        hint: 「たまえ」 in this familial context conveys a more traditional and perhaps stern authority from
          a male parent, lending a slightly old-fashioned feel. 「始めなさい」 is a common, polite command used
          by parents to children, without the same degree of traditional authority. We're looking for
          a firm instruction from a male parent with a traditional tone.
    scene: A father discovering his son hasn't started his homework, giving a firm instruction.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「始めたまえ」 is a clear, firm command from a male parent to his child. The slightly archaic feel
      of 「たまえ」 might make it sound somewhat old-fashioned or particularly stern in a modern family setting,
      emphasizing the father's authority.
    etymology: 「宿題」 (shukudai) means 'homework', composed of 「宿」 (shuku, lodging/inn) and 「題」 (dai, topic/title),
      referring to a task given to be completed at one's 'lodging'. 「どうした」 (dou shita) is a casual phrase
      asking 'What happened?' or 'What did you do?', used here to inquire about the status of the homework.
      「今すぐ」 (ima sugu) means 'right now' or 'immediately', with 「今」 (ima, now) and 「すぐ」 (sugu, immediately).
      The verb 「始める」 (hajimeru) means 'to begin' or 'to start'. The use of 「たまえ」 in this parent-child
      context lends a slightly old-fashioned or particularly stern tone, emphasizing the father's authority
      in a way that is less harsh than a plain imperative like 「始めろ」 but more firm than a polite request.
  - english: Alright, next person, please proceed this way.
    japanese:
      - はい、次 の 方、こちら へ お 進み {たまえ}。
      - はい、次 の 方、お 進み {たまえ}。
      - 次 の 方、こちら へ お 進み {たまえ}。
    english_literally: Yes, next person, this way, please advance.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - はい、次 の 方、こちら へ お 進み {ください}。
        english: Alright, next person, please proceed this way.
        hint: 「お進みたまえ」 is a formal directive used by male staff that carries a sense of clear instruction
          with traditional authority. 「お進みください」 is a standard polite request that is universally applicable
          and less directive. We're looking for a formal, directive instruction from male staff.
    scene: A male reception staff calling the next patient in a hospital waiting room.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「お進みたまえ」 in this context functions as a formal, almost official instruction from a male staff
      member in a service setting. It's directive but maintains a level of polite formality, distinct
      from a simple request.
    etymology: 「次の方」 (tsugi no kata) literally means 'the next person', where 「方」 (kata) is a polite and
      respectful term for 'person'. 「こちらへ」 (kochira e) means 'this way', with 「こちら」 (kochira) being the
      polite form of 「ここ」 (koko, here). 「お進み」 (osusumi) is the honorific form of the verb 「進む」 (susumu,
      to proceed/advance), indicating respect. The combined expression 「お進みたまえ」 is a formal and directive
      instruction often used in professional or service settings where clear, polite guidance is necessary,
      demonstrating the staff's authority while maintaining decorum. This reflects the nuance of 「たまえ」
      being a formal command that can also be used in service contexts.
  - english: Pay close attention to this. Master the basics thoroughly.
    japanese:
      - これ を よく 見 {たまえ}。基本 を しっかり 身 に つけ {たまえ}。
      - これ を よく 見 {たまえ}。基本 を 身 に つけ {たまえ}。
      - 基本 を しっかり 身 に つけ {たまえ}。

          - これ を よく 見 {なさい}。基本 を しっかり 身 に つけ {なさい}。
        english: Pay close attention to this. Master the basics thoroughly.
        hint: 「～なさい」 is a general polite command often used for instruction, but 「たまえ」 carries a more
          traditional, authoritative, and often male-centric nuance, particularly in master-apprentice
          settings. We're looking for a traditional master's instruction.
    scene: An old artisan (male) instructing his young male apprentice in a traditional craft workshop.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This example uses 「たまえ」 used by a master instructing an apprentice, emphasizing the importance
      of foundational skills. The tone is instructive and authoritative but also benevolent, typical of
      a mentor-mentee relationship.
  - english: Don't give up! Fight to the very end!
    japanese:
      - 諦める な！最後 まで 戦い {たまえ}！
      - 最後 まで 戦い {たまえ}！
      - 最後 まで しっかり 戦い {たまえ}！
    english_literally: Don't give up! To the very end, fight!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 諦める な！最後 まで {戦え}！
        english: Don't give up! Fight to the very end!
        hint: The plain imperative 「戦え」 is very direct and forceful. While effective, 「たまえ」 adds a layer
          of solemn authority and exhortation, often used in more traditional or dramatic calls to action
          by a male leader. We're looking for an inspiring, yet authoritative, command from a male coach.
    scene: A male coach giving a pep talk to his male soccer team during a difficult match.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Here, 「たまえ」 is used to inspire and command a team to persevere. It's direct but carries a
      motivational weight, fitting for a coach. It's less about strict hierarchy and more about leading
      by example or encouragement in a tense situation. The phrase 「諦めるな」 is a plain imperative, but 「戦いたまえ」
      softens the direct command while maintaining strong encouragement.
    etymology: 「諦める」 (akirameru) means 'to give up'. 「戦う」 (tatakau) means 'to fight'. The imperative 「諦めるな」
      (akirameru na) uses the prohibitive particle 「な」 to forbid an action. This combination of a direct
      prohibition and an authoritative command using 「たまえ」 creates a strong motivational statement, common
      in sports or military contexts.
  - english: Do not be swayed by fleeting trends. Look ahead to the distant future.
    japanese:
      - 一時 の 流行 に 流さ れる な。遥か な 未来 を 見 {たまえ}。
      - 遥か な 未来 を 見 {たまえ}。
      - 一時 の 流行 に 流さ れる こと なく、遥か な 未来 を 見 {たまえ}。
    english_literally: One moment's trends, don't be swayed by. Distant future, look at.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一時 の 流行 に 流さ れる な。遥か な 未来 を 見 {なさい}。
        english: Do not be swayed by fleeting trends. Look ahead to the distant future.
        hint: When giving life advice or profound guidance, 「たまえ」 lends a more venerable and authoritative
          tone, common from older male figures conveying wisdom. 「見なさい」 is a general instruction lacking
          this specific gravitas. We're looking for a wise elder's profound advice.
    scene: A respected male elder sharing wisdom with a younger person or group, perhaps in a reflective
      setting.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This example uses 「たまえ」 in a context of giving life advice or wisdom, emphasizing foresight
      and stability. It shows 「たまえ」 can be used for profound, guiding statements, not just immediate commands.
      It implies a sense of experience and authority from the speaker.
    etymology: 「一時」 (ichiji) means 'for a short time' or 'temporary', and 「流行」 (ryuukou) means 'trend'
      or 'fashion'. 「流さ れる」 (nagasareru) is the passive form of 「流す」 (nagasu, to let flow), meaning 'to
      be swayed' or 'to be carried away'. 「遥か な」 (haruka na) means 'distant' or 'far-off'. 「未来」 (mirai)
      means 'future'. This phrasing creates a profound, reflective tone suitable for imparting wisdom.
  - english: You, child, come over here quickly.
    japanese:
      - 子 ども よ、早く こちら へ 来 {たまえ}。
      - 早く こちら へ 来 {たまえ}。

    english_literally: Child, quickly this way come.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子 ども よ、早く こちら へ 来 {なさい}。
        english: You, child, come over here quickly.
        hint: While 「来なさい」 is a common parental command, 「来たまえ」 carries a more traditional, slightly formal,
          and authoritative tone often used by an elder. We are looking for a command from an elder to
          a child that conveys a sense of tradition and authority.
    scene: An older male teacher calling a child over in a traditional setting.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This usage emphasizes the male speaker's position of authority and care over a child. The
      vocative particle 「よ」 after 「子 ども」 (kodomo, child) further highlights the direct address in a traditional
      or slightly literary manner. The usage of 「たまえ」 maintains decorum while giving a direct instruction.
    etymology: The term 「子 ども」 (kodomo) itself implies a generational difference. 「早く」 (hayaku) means
      'quickly'. The use of 「来たまえ」 is a classic example of an elder speaking to a younger individual,
      particularly common in older forms of Japanese or in specific formal settings. The combination of
      「早く」 and 「来たまえ」 demonstrates a firm but not harsh directive.
  - english: Pay attention! Everyone, focus your gaze here.
    japanese:
      - 皆、注意 し {たまえ}！
      - 皆、注意 し {たまえ}！こちら に 目 を 向け {たまえ}。
      - 皆、こちら に 目 を 向け {たまえ}。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 皆、注意 し {なさい}！
        english: Everyone, pay attention!
        hint: 「～なさい」 is a common instruction, but 「たまえ」 delivers a more commanding and authoritative tone
          suitable for addressing a group, typically by a male figure of authority. We're looking for
          a strong, formal command to a group.
    scene: A male lecturer addressing a potentially distracted audience or a military commander addressing
      troops.
    register: formal
    setting: commanding
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Used to command a group, this emphasizes the speaker's authority and expectation of immediate
      compliance. The direct address to 「皆」 (mina, everyone) with 「たまえ」 carries a formal and serious tone,
      suitable for a speaker in a position of leadership or instruction.
    etymology: 「皆」 (mina) means 'everyone' or 'all'. 「注意する」 (chūi suru) means 'to pay attention' or 'to
      be careful'. The phrase 「注意したまえ」 is a direct and forceful call for attention, often used in public
      speaking or instructional settings where the speaker needs to assert control. This reflects the
      use of 「たまえ」 in a context of commanding a collective rather than just an individual.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate the versatile application of 「たまえ」 across various contexts,
  from professional settings and academic discussions to familial interactions and archaic pleas. While
  consistently conveying an authoritative tone, the level of formality and the specific nuance can shift
  based on the speaker's and listener's relationship, the setting, and the presence of other softening
  or intensifying linguistic elements. It is primarily used by male speakers and often conveys a sense
  of traditional authority or a benevolent but firm instruction.
