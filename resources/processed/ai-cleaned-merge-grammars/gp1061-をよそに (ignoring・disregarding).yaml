writeup: |-
  「をよそに」 expresses that an external situation (A) is disregarded or ignored by an actor (B). It can be translated as "ignoring (A)," "disregarding (A)," or "despite (A)." This grammar point combines the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「余所 (よそ)」 (other place), and the case-marking particle 「に」. Its literal meaning is akin to "putting (A) completely aside, (B)." This structure follows nouns or phrases nominalized with 「の」. It is a relatively formal expression, frequently encountered in written Japanese.

  The most common usage pattern for 「をよそに」 is when (A) describes an overall circumstance or expectation, and (B) indicates an action taken without consideration or regard for those circumstances. Consequently, it often carries a critical tone, implying that the actor's actions are irresponsible or self-centered. **Important Considerations** * 「をよそに」 is primarily used to highlight the actions of others; it is generally not used to describe the speaker's own actions. * While often used critically, it can sometimes describe a situation where an outcome occurs "despite" an external factor, without necessarily implying irresponsibility, though this usage is less common.

    grammar_point: をものともせず (making nothing of)
post_false_friends_writeup: While the expressions above can sometimes translate similarly to "をよそに", it
  is crucial to understand their distinct nuances. "を無視して" is a straightforward statement of ignoring.
  "にもかかわらず" simply expresses a factual 'despite' without conveying a judgmental tone. "を顧みず" is a more
  emphatic and often literary way to say 'without regard for', implying a deeper neglect. "をものともせず" uniquely
  highlights overcoming obstacles, presenting a positive rather than critical implication. Choose "をよそに"
  when you want to convey a sense of a person or entity acting irresponsibly or selfishly by knowingly
  disregarding external circumstances, advice, or concerns.

          the forecast.

      successful against adverse predictions.

post_example_writeup: As you can see, while 「をよそに」 often carries a critical tone implying irresponsibility,
  it can also be used in contexts where an outcome simply proceeds 'despite' an external factor, often
  leading to a surprising or positive result, as seen in some examples. This flexibility in nuance requires
  careful consideration of the context.
