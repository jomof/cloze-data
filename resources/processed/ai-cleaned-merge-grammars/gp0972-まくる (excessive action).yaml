jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to emphasize the intensity, frequency, or recklessness of an action. Often implies
    a lack of control or thought for consequences.
  function: Intensifier, repetition marker
  nuance: Implies an action done vigorously, excessively, or heedlessly. Can convey both positive (e.g.,
    having a lot of fun) and negative (e.g., losing control) connotations.
  grammatical-role: Modifies the preceding verb, adding a sense of over-the-top action.
etymology: The grammar point 「まくる」 originates from the verb 「捲る (めくる)」, which means "to roll up," "to
  turn over," or "to flip." This etymology conveys the core idea of repeated or continuous action, as
  if one is constantly "turning over" or cycling through the action. This connection between 'turning
  over' and 'repeated/excessive action' highlights the visual imagery of continuous, vigorous motion,
  much like continuously turning pages or rolling something over and over. Over time, its meaning evolved
  to encompass the intensity and lack of restraint seen in its modern usage.
writeup: |-
  「まくる」 is an auxiliary verb that attaches to the **ます-stem** of other verbs. It expresses that an action is being performed with great intensity, frequency, or without restraint. It essentially conveys the meaning of "doing [verb] like crazy," "doing nothing but [verb]," or "constantly doing [verb]."

  This expression is versatile and can be used in both positive and negative contexts, depending on the main verb and the situation. However, it often carries a nuance of recklessness or abandon, implying that the speaker or subject is not considering the consequences of their repeated or vigorous actions. It's crucial to note that the verb preceding 「まくる」 must be **volitional**, meaning it is an action that the subject has control over and can repeat.

  While primarily used as an auxiliary verb, the ます-stem + まくり form can also function as a noun, typically followed by だ (e.g., 食べまくりだ - 'It's a food spree'), to describe the state or result of excessive action.

  Key characteristics of 「まくる」:
  *   **Attachment**: Always connects to the ます-stem of a verb (e.g., 食べる → 食べまくる, 読む → 読みまくる).
  *   **Intensity/Frequency**: Highlights that an action is done a lot, very enthusiastically, or repeatedly.
  *   **Nuance**: Frequently suggests a lack of inhibition, doing something "to an extreme," or being consumed by an action.
  *   **Volitional Verbs**: Strictly applies to verbs that describe intentional actions.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[ます stem] + まくり + だ
    meaning: a spree of [verb]ing; to be in a state of excessive [verb]ing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Verb[ます stem] + まくり + だ」 treats the excessive action as a noun, often referring to the *result*
      or *state* of the action (e.g., 'a shopping spree', 'a reading marathon'). In contrast, 「まくる」 functions
      as a verb, describing the action itself with intensity and repetition.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[ます stem] + まくり + だ (state of excessive action)
  - term: 〜すぎる
    meaning: too much; excessively
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both convey excess, 「〜すぎる」 often implies that the action has gone beyond a desirable
      or acceptable limit, leading to a negative outcome or criticism (e.g., 食べすぎる 'eat too much', leading
      to illness). 「まくる」 simply emphasizes the *quantity* or *intensity* of the action, not necessarily
      that it's the *only* thing being done. One could be 食べまくる (eating excessively) while also doing
      other things, but 食べるばかり (only eating) excludes other activities.
    grammar_point: すぎる (too much・excessive)
  - term: ばかり
    meaning: only; nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ばかり」 focuses on exclusivity, meaning 'only doing X' or 'nothing but X' (e.g., 食べるばかり 'only
      eating'). 「まくる」, however, emphasizes the *intensity and sheer volume* of the action, not necessarily
      that it's the *only* thing being done. One could be 食べまくる (eating excessively) while also doing
      other things, but 食べるばかり (only eating) excludes other activities.
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・excessive)
  - term: Verb + てしまう
    meaning: to do completely; to do regrettably; to finish doing
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「まくる」 emphasizes the *intensity* or *excessive quantity* of an action, 「〜てしまう」 focuses
      on the *completion* of an action, often with a sense of regret, unintended consequence, or finality.
      For example, 食べまくる (to eat excessively) vs. 食べちゃう (to eat it all up, perhaps regrettably).
    grammar_point: てしまう・ちゃう (completion・regret・accident)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「まくる」 from similar expressions, consider whether the focus
  is on the action's sheer volume or intensity (まくる), the resulting state or noun-like excessive activity
  (まくりだ), exceeding an appropriate limit (〜すぎる), exclusivity (ばかり), or the completion/regrettable outcome
  of an action (〜てしまう). Each carries a distinct nuance that impacts the overall meaning of the sentence.

    japanese:

        english: He locks himself in his room on weekends to make a lot of plastic models.
        hint: While 「たくさん作る」 indicates making a large quantity, 「作りまくる」 emphasizes the relentless, non-stop
          nature and intensity of the action. We're looking for a sense of doing it "like crazy."
    scene: Describing a friend's intense hobby.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「作りまくる」 highlights the hobbyist's intense dedication, implying a deep immersion
      in the activity. This usage is common among younger individuals discussing hobbies with peers or
      in informal settings.
    etymology: The verb 「作る」 (tsukuru) means 'to make' or 'to create'. Coupled with 「まくる」, it emphasizes
      the continuous and excessive nature of the making.

          for the feeling of being swamped with presentations.

    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The polite form 「やりまくります」 is suitable for a professional setting, even when discussing intense
      work. The phrase conveys the high volume of presentations without explicitly stating a negative
      connotation, which is important in business communication. The use of 「から」 for reason and 「とても大事です」
      for importance makes it a standard formal-leaning statement.
    etymology: 「やる」 (yaru) is a versatile verb meaning 'to do' or 'to perform'. The combination 「やりまくる」
      emphasizes the overwhelming frequency or intensity of doing presentations.
  - english: After the exam, I played video games excessively to relieve stress.

          of playing "like crazy."

    speaker_age: younger

      between friends. The phrase 「しまくって」 vividly expresses the uninhibited, intense gaming session, commonly
      used by younger speakers to describe recreational activities.

        english: My stomach hurts because I ate too much delicious food at our travel destination.
        hint: While both imply eating a lot, 「食べすぎた」 explicitly states that the quantity was excessive
          to the point of causing a negative consequence. 「食べまくった」 focuses on the relentless, unrestrained
          action of eating, which in this context led to a stomach ache, but its primary meaning is about
          the intensity of the act itself. We're looking for the intensity of eating, leading to the problem.

          to the pressure. We're looking for the intense, non-stop action of drinking.

      an uninhibited activity. It conveys a strong desire to play intensely and without limits, common

      for slightly more formal situations.
post_example_writeup: While 「まくる」 generally describes an action done with great intensity or frequency,
  its specific nuance can vary. It can sometimes imply a positive, uninhibited enjoyment, like "playing
  like crazy" (遊びまくる). Other times, it might suggest a lack of control or an excessive, possibly problematic,
  behavior, such as "drinking excessively" (飲みまくる). The context is key to understanding the speaker's
  implied judgment or observation.
