details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: expresses causation (making someone do something) or permission (letting someone do something).
  nuance: The nuance of compulsion ('make') versus permission ('let') often depends on context, the particle
    used (に for the agent when the original verb is intransitive, or を when the original verb is transitive
    and the agent performs the action), and the speaker's intention. It can also cause an emotion or state.
  grammatical-role: Modifies a verb to indicate that the subject causes another person to perform the
    action.
etymology: The causative suffix `せる/させる` evolved from older forms like `〜しむ` and `〜す`, which were used
  to convey the meaning of 'causing to do.' The modern form `させる` for Group 2 and irregular verbs, and
  `せる` for Group 1 verbs, standardized this grammatical function across different verb conjugations. The
  core concept remains that the subject instigates or allows the action of another.
writeup: |-
  The causative form `Verb[させる]` is a fundamental grammatical structure in Japanese used to express either **making someone do something** (causation/compulsion) or **letting someone do something** (permission/allowance). The specific nuance often depends heavily on context, the particles used with the participants, and the speaker's intention.

  When used with the particle 「に」 to mark the person being caused to act (e.g., 先生が学生に宿題を**させます** - The teacher **makes** the students do homework), it typically implies compulsion or a strong directive, especially with intransitive verbs. Conversely, when used with the particle 「を」 (e.g., 先生が学生を自由に発表**させます** - The teacher **lets** the students present freely), it often conveys permission or allowing. However, this is not a strict rule; the particle 「を」 can also be used for compulsion, particularly with transitive verbs where the direct object of the original verb is preserved (e.g., 医者が患者を歩かせる - The doctor makes the patient walk).

  The causative form is highly versatile and is essential for expressing complex interpersonal actions and responsibilities in Japanese. It can also be used to describe causing a state or emotion, such as 泣かせる (to make someone cry) or 笑わせる (to make someone laugh). While the form itself is widely applicable across registers, the specific choice of verb and particles can influence the perceived formality or politeness.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[させられる] (causative-passive)
    meaning: to be made/forced to do (by someone)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While Verb[させる] describes the *causer's* action of making or letting someone do something,
      Verb[させられる] describes the *receiver's* experience of being made to do something, often implying
      compulsion or a negative feeling.
    grammar_point: Verb[させられる] (causative-passive)
  - term: Verb[(ら)れる] (passive voice)
    meaning: to be Verbed
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: The passive voice simply states that the subject *receives* an action. It doesn't imply causation
      or permission from another party for the action itself, but rather that the action happened *to*
      the subject. For some Group 2 verbs, the passive form (e.g., 見られる - to be seen) looks similar to
      the causative form (e.g., 見させる - to make/let see), leading to confusion.
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (passive voice)
  - term: Verb[て]あげる・やる (to do for someone)
    meaning: to do something for someone
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These forms indicate the speaker or subject performs an action as a favor for someone else.
      Unlike causative, which makes or lets *another person* perform the action, 〜てあげる and 〜てやる mean *I*
      do it *for them*.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て]あげる (to do for someone, outward)
  - term: Verb[て]もらう (to have someone do for you)
    meaning: to have someone do something for you; to receive an action
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expresses receiving a favor or action from someone. While similar to the 'letting' nuance
      of causative (e.g., 〜させてあげる or 〜させてくれる), it focuses on the receiver's benefit and the willingness
      of the actor. The causative simply states permission or causation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て]もらう (to have someone do, receive an action)
  - term: Verb[て]ほしい (want someone to do)
    meaning: to want someone to do something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜てほしい expresses a desire for someone else to perform an action, but it does not state that
      the action *will* occur or that the speaker has the authority to *make* it happen, as the causative
      can.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て]ほしい (to want someone to do)
post_false_friends_writeup: The causative form Verb[させる] is distinct from related expressions that describe
  actions involving multiple parties. While Verb[させられる] focuses on the experience of *being made* to do
  something, the simple passive Verb[(ら)れる] describes simply *receiving* an action. Forms like 〜てあげる and
  〜てくれる indicate performing an action *for* someone, and 〜てもらう signifies *receiving* an action from someone,
  emphasizing the favor aspect rather than direct causation or permission. Lastly, 〜てほしい expresses a *desire*
  for someone to do something, not the act of making or letting them do it. Understanding these distinctions
  is key to using the causative form precisely.
examples:
  - english: My mom made me clean my room.
    japanese:
      - 母 は 私 に 部屋 を {掃除 さ せ た}。
      - 母 は 私 に 部屋 を {掃除 さ せ まし た}。
    english_literally: My mom, as for, me, my room, made clean.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 母 は 私 に 部屋 を 掃除 する よう に 言っ た。
        english: My mom told me to clean my room.
        hint: We're looking for an action directly forced, not just told. 「〜ように言う」 expresses telling or
          requesting someone to do something.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 母 は 私 の 部屋 を 掃除 し た。
        english: Everyone complained because of the new policy.
        hint: We're looking for the child doing the cleaning, not the mom. This sentence shows the mom
          as the actor, not the cause.
    scene: A child complaining about chores to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This sentence uses the causative form with the particle 「に」 (ni) to indicate that the mother
      forced or compelled the child to clean the room. The implication is that the child did not want
      to clean but was made to do so. 「掃除させた」 (souji saseru) directly means 'to make someone clean'.
  - english: My teacher let me use the dictionary during the test.
    japanese:
      - 先生 は 私 に 試験 中 辞書 を {使わ せ て くれ た}。
      - 先生 は 私 に 試験 中 辞書 を {使わ せ て 下さい まし た}。
      - 先生 は 私 に 試験 中 辞書 を {使わ せ て 下さっ た}。
    english_literally: The teacher, as for, me, during the test, dictionary, let me use for me.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 は 私 に 試験 中 辞書 を 使っ て も いい と 言っ た。
        english: My teacher said it was okay for me to use the dictionary during the test.
        hint: We're looking for the teacher's direct allowance, not just stating permission. 「〜てもいい」 expresses
          permission, and 「〜と言った」 states that it was verbally allowed.
    scene: A student describing a lenient teacher to a classmate.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    nuance: Here, 「使わせてくれた」 (tsukawasete kureta) uses the causative form combined with 「〜てくれる」 to show
      that the teacher *permitted* or *allowed* the student to use the dictionary, and this was a favor
      done for the student. The use of 「に」 (ni) with the person receiving permission is common in such
      contexts.
  - english: His joke made everyone laugh.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 冗談 は みんな を {笑わ せ た}。
      - 彼 の 冗談 は みんな を {笑わ せ まし た}。
      - 彼 の 冗談 は みんな を {笑わ せ た よ}。
    english_literally: His joke, as for, everyone, made laugh.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 冗談 で みんな は 笑っ た。
        english: Everyone laughed because of his joke.
        hint: We're looking for the joke *causing* the laughter, not just being the reason for it. 「〜で」
          here indicates the cause, but not the direct act of making.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は みんな を 笑わ せよう と し た。
        english: He tried to make everyone laugh.
        hint: We're looking for the result (they *did* laugh), not just the intention. 「〜ようとした」 expresses
          an attempt or intention.
    scene: Two friends discussing a stand-up comedian's performance.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    nuance: This illustrates the causative used to cause an emotion or reaction. The particle 「を」 (o)
      is used with the person experiencing the emotion. 「笑わせた」 (warawaseta) means 'made laugh'.
  - english: My boss makes me work overtime every day.
    japanese:
      - 上司 は 私 に 毎日 残業 を {さ せる}。
      - 上司 は 私 に 毎日 残業 を {さ せ ます}。
    english_literally: The boss, as for, me, every day, overtime, makes do.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 上司 は 私 に 毎日 残業 を 命じる。
        english: My boss orders me to work overtime every day.
        hint: We're looking for the boss *causing* the work, not just issuing an order. 「命じる」 (meijiru)
          means to order or command.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 毎日 残業 を し なけれ ば なら ない。
        english: I have to work overtime every day.
        hint: We're looking for *who* is making me work, not just that I *have* to. This expresses obligation
          from the speaker's perspective without specifying the causer.
    scene: An employee complaining to a colleague after work.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: This example uses 「に」 (ni) to indicate direct compulsion from the boss. 「残業をさせる」 (zangyou
      o saseru) means 'to make someone do overtime'.
  - english: The company allows employees to choose their work hours freely.
    japanese:
      - 会社 は 社員 に 自由 に 勤務 時間 を {選ば せる}。
      - 会社 は 社員 に 自由 に 勤務 時間 を {選ば せ ます}。
    english_literally: The company, as for, employees, freely, work hours, makes choose.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会社 は 社員 が 自由 に 勤務 時間 を 選ぶ こと が できる。
        english: The company allows employees to be able to choose their work hours freely.
        hint: We're looking for the company actively *allowing* the choice, not just stating the possibility.
          「〜ことができる」 states possibility.
    scene: A company spokesperson explaining new employment benefits.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「選ばせる」 (erabaseru) means 'to make/let choose'. In this context, with 「自由に」 (jiyuu ni - freely),
      it clearly implies permission given by the company. The use of 「に」 (ni) with the person receiving
      permission is natural here.
  - english: The mother made her child eat all the vegetables.
    japanese:
      - 母親 は 子ども に 全て の 野菜 を {食べ させ た}。
      - 母親 は 子ども に 全て の 野菜 を {食べ させ まし た}。
      - 母親 は 子ども に 野菜 を 全部 {食べ させ た}。
    english_literally: The mother, as for, child, to, all of the vegetables, made eat.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 母親 は 子ども に 全て の 野菜 を 食べる よう に 言っ た。
        english: The mother told her child to eat all the vegetables.
        hint: We're looking for direct compulsion, not just a verbal request. This sentence implies the
          mother only spoke, not necessarily enforced the action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 母親 は 子ども に 全て の 野菜 を 食べ させ たがっ た。
        english: The mother wanted her child to eat all the vegetables.
        hint: We're looking for the action being completed due to compulsion, not just the desire. 「〜たがった」
          expresses someone's desire.
    scene: A parent at the dinner table, encouraging healthy eating habits.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This shows the causative with a transitive verb. The child is marked with 「に」 (ni), and the
      vegetables are marked with 「を」 (o), maintaining the direct object. 「食べさせた」 (tabesaseru) here implies
      the mother compelled her child to eat the vegetables.
  - english: My teacher allowed me to go to the library.
    japanese:
      - 先生 は 私 に 図書 館 へ {行か せ て くれ た}。
      - 先生 は 私 に 図書 館 へ {行か せ て 下さい まし た}。
      - 先生 は 私 に 図書 館 へ {行か せ て 下さっ た}。
    english_literally: The teacher, as for, me, to the library, let me go for me.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 は 私 に 図書 館 へ 行っ て も いい と 言っ た。
        english: My teacher said it was okay for me to go to the library.
        hint: We're looking for the teacher actively *allowing* the action, not just verbally approving
          it. 「〜てもいい」 expresses permission, and 「〜と言った」 states that it was verbally allowed.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 は 私 が 図書 館 へ 行く こと を 許し て くれ た。
        english: My teacher permitted me to go to the library.
        hint: While similar, this uses a more direct verb for 'permit.' Causative often implies a slightly
          more indirect 'making/letting' through influence. 「許す」 (yurusu) directly means to permit.
    scene: A student expressing gratitude to their teacher.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: supportive
    nuance: This example uses 「〜てくれた」 with the causative of an intransitive verb. 「行かせてくれた」 (ikasete kureta)
      means 'let me go' (and it was a favor). The particle 「に」 marks the recipient of the permission.
  - english: This medicine will make your headache go away.
    japanese:
      - この 薬 は 頭痛 を {忘れ させる} だろう。
      - この 薬 は 頭痛 を {忘れ させる} でしょう。
    english_literally: This medicine, as for, headache, will make forget.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 薬 を 飲め ば 頭痛 は 忘れる だろう。
        english: If you take this medicine, your headache will probably be forgotten.
        hint: We're looking for the medicine *actively causing* the state, not just being a condition
          for it. This implies a natural progression, not an active causative agent.
    scene: A doctor explaining the effects of a prescription to a patient.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Here, the subject is inanimate (「この薬」 - this medicine), causing a state in an animate object
      (「頭痛」 - headache, implying the person feeling it). 「忘れさせる」 (wasuresaseru) literally means 'makes
      forget' or 'causes to forget'. It is common for inanimate subjects to cause actions or states using
      the causative form.
  - english: My parents let me travel alone this summer.
    japanese:
      - 両親 は 私 に 今年 の 夏 一人 で 旅行 を {さ せ て くれ た}。
      - 両親 は 私 に 今年 の 夏 一人 で 旅行 を {さ せ て くれ まし た}。
      - 両親 は 私 に 今年 の 夏 一人 で 旅行 を {さ せ て 下さっ た}。
    english_literally: My parents, as for, me, to, this summer, alone, travel, let me do for me.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 両親 は 私 が 今年 の 夏 一人 で 旅行 する の を 許し て くれ た。
        english: My parents permitted me to travel alone this summer.
        hint: This is a more direct statement of permission using the verb 「許す」 (yurusu). Causative 「〜させてくれる」
          often emphasizes the 'letting' aspect in a slightly less formal way, or implies a favor given.
    scene: A young adult sharing their summer plans with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: Similar to Example 7, 「させてくれた」 (sasete kureta) indicates permission granted by the parents,
      with the added nuance of gratitude towards them for allowing it. The particle 「に」 marks the recipient
      of the permission.
  - english: The new policy made the workers complain.
    japanese:
      - 新しい 政策 は 労働 者 を {不平 を 言わ せ た}。
      - 新しい 政策 は 労働 者 を {不平 を 言わ せ まし た}。
      - 新しい 政策 は 労働 者 に 不平 を {言わ せ た}。
    english_literally: The new policy, as for, workers, made complain.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい 政策 の ため に 労働 者 が 不平 を 言っ た。
        english: Workers complained because of the new policy.
        hint: We're looking for the policy *causing* the complaining, not just being the reason for it.
          「〜のために」 indicates reason or cause.
    scene: A company executive discussing the impact of a recent change.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: This example shows the causative implying that the new policy *caused* or *forced* the workers
      to complain. While 「不平を言う」 (fuhei o iu - to complain) is technically transitive with an implied
      object of complaint, 「労働者」 (roudousha - workers) is marked with 「を」 (o), typical when the action
      is caused on the entity itself.
  - english: I let my younger brother use my new game console.
    japanese:
      - 弟 に 新しい ゲーム 機 を {使わ せ て やっ た}。
      - 弟 に 新しい ゲーム 機 を {使わ せ て あげ た}。
    english_literally: To younger brother, new game console, let use for him.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 弟 に 新しい ゲーム 機 を 使わ せ て あげ た。
        english: I let my younger brother use my new game console (slightly more polite/less direct than
          やった).
        hint: This is an alternative politeness level. 「やる」 is more casual/direct, sometimes implying
          a hierarchy or an action done for someone younger/lower status.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 弟 が 新しい ゲーム 機 を 使う の を 許し て あげ た。
        english: I permitted my younger brother to use the new game console.
        hint: This uses a direct verb for permission. 「許す」 is a more direct verb for permitting someone
          to do something.
    scene: An older sibling casually sharing their belongings with a younger family member.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「使わせてやった」 (tsukawasete yatta) uses the causative form plus 「やる」 (yaru), a casual form of 「あげる」
      (ageru), implying the speaker allowed the younger brother to use the console as a favor. The particle
      「に」 (ni) marks the recipient of the permission. The use of 「やった」 can sound slightly condescending
      if not used carefully, especially with someone outside one's close in-group or younger relatives.
  - english: That sad movie always makes me cry.
    japanese:
      - あの 悲しい 映画 は いつ も 私 を {泣か せる}。
      - あの 悲しい 映画 は いつ も 私 を {泣か せ ます}。
      - あの 悲しい 映画 は いつ も 私 を {泣か せる ん です}。
    english_literally: That sad movie, as for, always, me, makes cry.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 悲しい 映画 を 見る と いつ も 私 は 泣く。
        english: When I watch that sad movie, I always cry.
        hint: We're looking for the movie actively *causing* the crying, not just being a condition for
          it. 「〜と」 expresses a natural consequence or condition.
    scene: Two friends discussing their favorite (or least favorite) movies.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This is another example of the causative causing an emotion. 「泣かせる」 (nakaseru) means 'to make
      someone cry'. The subject (「あの悲しい映画」) is inanimate, and the object (「私」) is marked with 「を」 (o).
