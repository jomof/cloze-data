    "etymology": "「なお」 originates from the verb 「直る (naoru)」, meaning \"to be fixed, to be corrected, to be healed.\" The adverbial usage of 「なお」 implies adding or correcting information, thus leading to its current meaning of \"in addition\" or \"furthermore.\"",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「なお」, when used at the beginning of a sentence, carries the meaning of \"in addition,\" \"furthermore,\" \"even more,\" or \"moreover.\" It's regularly seen after a previous sentence expresses a base fact or situation, and the second sentence adds to it. Often, the information in the second part (B) is surprising or shocking. This structure almost always appears in hiragana. Since 「なお」 is formal, it frequently appears in letters, posters, commercials, and similar materials.\n\nIn all its uses, 「なお」 indicates that taking the previous information (A) into account, although (B) may not be expected, it is in fact true. This can be used either positively or negatively, highlighting (B) as exceeding expectations. Important to note that 「なお」 should not be used to correct information in the first sentence, but instead, should add to it.",
