etymology: The word 気持ち (kimochi) is a compound of 気 (ki), meaning 'spirit,' 'mind,' or 'energy,' and
  持ち (mochi), derived from the verb 持つ (motsu), 'to hold' or 'to possess.' Thus, 気持ち literally means 'that
  which one holds in their spirit or mind.' This etymological root clarifies why 気持ち can refer to both
  physical sensations (how one's body 'feels' or 'holds' energy) and mental/emotional states (what one
  'holds' in their mind or heart). It is a fundamental concept encompassing subjective internal experiences.
writeup: |-
  気持ち (kimochi) is a highly versatile noun in Japanese that refers to a person's **feeling, sensation, mood, or state of mind**. It is one of the most commonly used words to describe internal experiences and can be applied to a broad spectrum of situations, distinguishing it from more specific terms like 感情 (kanjou) which focuses solely on emotions.

  気持ち can describe:
  *   **Physical sensations**: For instance, 気持ちがいい (kimochi ga ii) means 'feels good' (e.g., a comfortable bed, a pleasant temperature), and 気持ちが悪い (kimochi ga warui) means 'feels bad' or 'nauseous' (e.g., motion sickness, a sickening sight).
  *   **Emotional states**: This includes everything from general happiness (嬉しい気持ち - ureshii kimochi) to sadness (悲しい気持ち - kanashii kimochi), gratitude (感謝の気持ち - kansha no kimochi), or relief (安心した気持ち - anshin shita kimochi).
  *   **General mood or atmosphere**: It can also refer to the overall disposition of a person or even the 'feeling' or 'vibe' of a place or situation. For example, 気持ちを切り替える (kimochi o kirikaeru) means 'to change one's mood/mindset'.

  When using 気持ち, it is often paired with adjectives like いい (ii - good), 悪い (warui - bad), 嬉しい (ureshii - happy), 悲しい (kanashii - sad), or verbs that describe changes in state like 落ち着く (ochitsuku - to calm down) or 落ち込む (ochikomu - to feel down). It is a foundational word for expressing subjective experience in Japanese.

  - term: 気分
    meaning: mood・spirit・state of mind
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 気持ち can cover general mood, 気分 tends to refer more specifically to a temporary, overall
      disposition, often influenced by external factors or physical well-being. It is more about the general
      'state' of one's disposition, like 'I am in a good mood' (気分がいい) or 'I do not feel like it' (気が進まない).
      気持ち focuses more on the specific internal *sensation* or *feeling*.

  - term: 感情
    meaning: emotion・feeling・passion
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 感情 refers exclusively to 'emotions' in a more formal, academic, or clinical sense (e.g., joy,
      anger, sadness, fear). 気持ち is a broader term that includes both physical sensations and emotional
      states, making it more common in everyday conversation. You would not typically say '気持ちの種類' (kinds
      of feelings) to list basic emotions, but rather '感情の種類'.

  - term: 心
    meaning: heart・mind・spirit
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 心 refers to the abstract 'heart' or 'mind' as the seat of one's thoughts, feelings, and consciousness.
      While 気持ち are 'held within' the 心, 心 is a more fundamental and profound concept, referring to the
      core of one's being or consciousness. You can 'have a kind heart' (心が優しい), but not 'a kind kimochi'.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:心 (heart・mind・spirit)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between 気持ち, 気分, and 感情, consider their scope. 気持ち is the
  most general term, encompassing both physical sensations and a wide range of emotional states. 気分 typically
  refers to a more transient, general disposition or mood, often influenced by immediate circumstances.
  感情 is a more specific and formal term, exclusively denoting fundamental human emotions like joy, anger,
  or sadness. When talking about a specific *sensation* or a nuanced *feeling* about something, 気持ち is
  usually the best choice. When referring to your general *disposition* or *how you are feeling overall*
  in a given moment, 気分 is often more appropriate. When discussing *basic human emotions* or their psychological
  aspects, 感情 is the precise term.
