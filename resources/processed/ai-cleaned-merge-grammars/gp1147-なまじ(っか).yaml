    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "Expresses regret or negative consequences resulting from insufficient or incomplete actions or states. It often implies that it would have been better if the action or state had not occurred at all.",
        "nuance": "The variation without the small っ (なまじか) is also used, though less common."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「なまじ」 comes from 「生」 (nama), meaning raw or incomplete, combined with 「強し」 (tsuyoshi), an old form of 「強い」 (tsuyoi), meaning strong. Together, they suggest something is 'incompletely strong' or 'half-baked,' leading to the negative outcome implied by the word. The 「っか」 is an emphatic suffix.",
    "writeup": "**なまじ(っか)** is an adverb that expresses that something is done half-heartedly or inadequately, leading to an undesirable result. It implies that it would have been better if the action had not been done at all, conveying a sense of regret or criticism regarding the insufficient nature of something. This nuance is crucial, as the grammar point highlights how a seemingly positive or neutral attribute, when incomplete or superficial, paradoxically becomes the cause of a negative outcome. It can modify verbs, adjectives, or nouns to add this nuance. The form 「なまじか」 (without the っ) is also acceptable, though 「なまじっか」 is more commonly encountered. The kanji form is 生強し, but this is almost never seen in modern Japanese.",

            "english_literally": "Because I can use a computer half-heartedly, even on holidays, requests from friends are many, and I am troubled.",

                    "mitigation": "「少し」 implies a small degree of ability but doesn't convey the sense that this ability is itself the source of an *unfortunate* outcome, as 「なまじっか」 does. The scene sets a complaining tone, highlighting the undesirable result."

                    "mitigation": "This alternative is a neutral statement of cause and effect. 「なまじっか」 specifically adds the nuance that the speaker regrets having *any* ability because it leads to these unwanted requests, which the complaining tone of the scene reinforces."
