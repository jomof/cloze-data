    "writeup": "**なまじ(っか)** is an adverb that expresses that something is done half-heartedly or inadequately, leading to an undesirable result. It implies that it would have been better if the action had not been done at all. It conveys a sense of regret or criticism regarding the insufficient nature of something. It can modify verbs, adjectives, or nouns to add this nuance. The form 「なまじか」 (without the っ) is also acceptable, though 「なまじっか」is more common. The kanji form is 生強し, which is almost never seen.",
    "etymology": "The term 「なまじ」 comes from 「生」 (nama), meaning raw or incomplete, combined with 「強し」 (tsuyoshi), an old form of 「強い」 (tsuyoi), meaning strong. Together, they suggest something is 'incompletely strong' or 'half-baked,' leading to the negative outcome implied by the word. The 「っか」 is an emphatic suffix.",
