        "function": "To set aside one situation (A) as acceptable or understandable, and then express that another situation (B) is unacceptable or problematic, often implying a speaker's disapproval or disagreement with B."
    },
    "etymology": "「なら」is the conditional form of the copula 「だ」, indicating a hypothetical situation. 「ともかく」 means \"anyway,\" \"at any rate,\" or \"to leave aside,\" implying that we are setting aside one situation to focus on another.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point `{ならともかく}` is a fixed phrase used to express that while a hypothetical situation A might be acceptable or understandable, situation B is not. It functions to create a contrast, indicating that if A were the case, the outcome or perspective would be different, but since B is the actual situation, the current outcome or perspective holds. This often conveys the speaker's disapproval, disbelief, or strong disagreement with situation B.\n\nGrammatically, `{なら}` is the conditional form of the copula `{だ}` (to be), indicating a hypothetical condition. `{ともかく}` means \"anyway,\" \"at any rate,\" or \"to leave aside,\" literally implying that one is setting aside situation A to focus on B.\n\nWhile `{なら}` can theoretically attach to plain forms of verbs, adjectives, and nouns, `{ならともかく}` is almost exclusively used after **nouns**. It allows the speaker to acknowledge a specific (often less severe or more understandable) circumstance, only to then highlight a more severe or unacceptable one. It's a common expression in **spoken Japanese** to convey a nuanced rejection or judgment.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Both ならともかく and ならまだしも set up a hypothetical acceptable condition (A) to contrast it with an unacceptable real situation (B). However, ならまだしも often carries a stronger nuance of \"A would be barely acceptable, but B is utterly unacceptable.\" It implies that A itself is already a low bar, and B falls even below that. ならともかく is more about acknowledging A as a possibility that *would* lead to a different conclusion, but dismissing B."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing between ならともかく and ならまだしも, consider the speaker's degree of tolerance. ならともかく tends to acknowledge situation A as genuinely acceptable or understandable, then pivots to reject situation B. In contrast, ならまだしも often implies that even situation A is just barely acceptable, and situation B is significantly worse or completely out of the question. Think of ならともかく as \"A is fine, but B isn't\" and ならまだしも as \"Even A would be a stretch, but B is definitely not okay.\"",
