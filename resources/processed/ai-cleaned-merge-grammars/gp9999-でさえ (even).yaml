  Noun + でさえ: Used to emphasize an extreme or surprising example.
  Verb[て] + でさえ: Emphasizes the state or means; less common, implies 'even by doing X' or 'even in the

jlpt: N2
etymology: The particle 「で」indicates means, cause, or location. 「さえ」comes from 「添える (そえる)」, meaning 'to
  add to' or 'to accompany'. Thus, 「でさえ」literally signifies 'even with (that means/state/location), in
  addition to'. This combination highlights an extreme or surprising example, reinforcing the idea of
  'at least' or 'minimum' by adding emphasis to the condition or means.
writeup: |-
  「でさえ」is a particle combination that serves to emphasize an extreme or surprising example, implying that something is true for all less extreme cases as well. It translates to "even", "even if", or "even though". It is often used to highlight a minimum threshold or an unexpected case. For instance, if even the most difficult task can be done, then easier tasks can certainly be done.

  While similar to 「さえ」, the addition of 「で」can sometimes add a nuance of "even by means of" or "even in this state/condition". It reinforces the idea of "at least" or "minimum". It can also carry a nuance of exasperation or surprise, indicating that something applies to a case where one might least expect it. It can attach to nouns directly, or to the て-form of verbs, or conditional ば-form of verbs, though these are less common.

    meaning: even, moreover
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「さえ」alone can be broader, often emphasizing a minimum requirement or simply an additional
      item. 「でさえ」specifically emphasizes the condition or means (indicated by 「で」) that something applies
      to, often highlighting an extreme or unexpected case *within* that condition/means.

  - term: すら
    meaning: even, let alone
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「すら」is more formal and literary than 「でさえ」, often used in negative contexts or to express
      surprise/disappointment that something applies to an unlikely case. It can imply a strong "not even"
      or "let alone". 「でさえ」is more common in everyday speech.
    grammar_point: すら (even)
  - term: まで
    meaning: up to, until, even to the extent of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「まで」can mean "even" but typically implies reaching a limit or extent. When it means "even",
      it suggests reaching an extreme point. 「でさえ」is purely emphatic, not necessarily indicating an extent
      or limit, but rather highlighting an unexpected or extreme example.
    grammar_point: まで (even to the extent)
  - term: ですら
    meaning: even (polite)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ですら」is the polite equivalent of 「でさえ」. It uses the polite copula です before すら. It is typically
      used in formal or polite contexts, maintaining the strong emphasis on an extreme or surprising case.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ですら (even・polite)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「さえ」, 「すら」, and 「まで」 can all convey the meaning of "even," they carry
  distinct nuances. 「さえ」often highlights a minimal condition or a surprising inclusion. 「すら」is more formal
  and often implies a negative or unexpected outcome, sometimes with a sense of regret or surprise at
  the unlikelihood. 「まで」suggests reaching an extreme limit or extent. 「でさえ」, on the other hand, emphasizes
  that something applies even in a specific (often extreme or surprising) condition or context, reinforcing
  the universality of the statement. For example, 「子供でさえできる」 (Even a child can do it) suggests that if
  even a child (an extreme case) can do it, anyone can. The polite form of 「でさえ」is usually 「ですら」 or 「でさえあります」.
