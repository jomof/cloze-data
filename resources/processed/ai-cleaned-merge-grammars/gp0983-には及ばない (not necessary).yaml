    "etymology": "The grammar point には及ばない is composed of に (a particle indicating purpose or direction), は (a contrastive particle), and 及ばない, the negative form of the u-verb 及ぶ (oyobu), which means \"to reach\" or \"to extend\". Thus, literally, it means \"it does not reach to\" or \"there is no need to reach to\".",
    "writeup": "The Japanese grammar point には及ばない is a versatile expression used to convey two main meanings: either that an action is **unnecessary** or that something is **not comparable** to another thing. This flexibility arises from its components: the particle に (indicating purpose or direction), the contrastive particle は, and 及ばない, which is the negative form of the verb 及ぶ (oyobu), meaning \"to reach\" or \"to extend\".\n\nWhen には及ばない follows a verb in its dictionary form, it means \"there is no need to\" or \"it is unnecessary to\" perform that action. This usage often implies that the effort or action would be excessive or pointless given the circumstances. It can be used to politely decline an an offer or to reassure someone that extra effort is not required.\n\nWhen には及ばない follows a noun, it typically means that the subject is \"not comparable to\" or \"does not reach the level of\" that noun. This is used for comparisons where one thing is clearly inferior to another. This usage is common in objective assessments, humble self-appraisals, or critical analyses.\n\nWhile 及ばない itself is a simple negative verb form, the combination with に and は creates a fixed expression with specific nuances that are not always directly translatable. It can be used across various registers, from casual conversation to formal business discussions, with the polite forms には及びません and には及びませんでした being common in more formal settings. Understanding the context is key to discerning whether it implies non-necessity or non-comparability.",
