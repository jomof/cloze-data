    "etymology": "The grammar point `には及ばない` is composed of `に` (a particle indicating purpose or direction), `は` (a contrastive particle), and `及ばない`, the negative form of the u-verb `及ぶ` (oyobu), which means \"to reach\" or \"to extend\". Thus, literally, it means \"it does not reach to\" or \"there is no need to reach to\".",
    "writeup": "`には及ばない` is a polite expression in Japanese used to indicate that there is 'no need to (A)', or that '(A) is unnecessary'. It is a combination of the case-marking particle `に`, the adverbial particle `は`, and the negated form of the u-verb `及ぶ` (to reach), `及ばない`. The literal translation is 'it does not extend to (A)'. This phrase will appear after nouns, or verbs in their dictionary form. As this grammar pattern is used in polite speech, the word it is attached to is often preceded by either `お` or `ご`, depending on the verb type. **Important Considerations:** When not used as a polite expression, `には及ばない` may simply show the extent of something, usually when a comparison is being made between two things. This use will be translated as '(A) does not reach the extent of (B)', or '(A) cannot be compared to (B)'. This distinction is crucial for proper comprehension.",
