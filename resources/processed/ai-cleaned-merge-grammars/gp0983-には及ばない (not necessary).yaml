    "etymology": "The grammar point 「には及ばない」 is composed of 「に」 (a particle indicating purpose or direction), 「は」 (a contrastive particle), and 「及ばない」, the negative form of the verb 「及ぶ」 (oyobu), which means \"to reach\" or \"to extend\". Thus, literally, it means \"it does not reach to\" or \"there is no need to reach to\".",
    "writeup": "「には及ばない」 is a polite expression used to indicate that there is no need to do something, or that something is unnecessary. It is a combination of the case-marking particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negated form of the う-verb 「及ぶ」 (to reach), 「及ばない」. The literal translation is \"it does not extend to (A)\". This phrase will appear after nouns or verbs in their dictionary form. As this grammar pattern is used in polite speech, the word that it is attached to is often preceded by either 「お」 or 「ご」, depending on what type of verb it is.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nWhen not used as a polite expression, 「には及ばない」 may simply show the extent of something, usually when a comparison is being made between two things. This use will be translated as \"(A) does not reach the extent of (B)\", or \"(A) cannot be compared to (B)\". This distinction is crucial for proper comprehension.",

            "nuance": "The speaker uses the polite form 「には及びません」 with a playful tone to establish an immediate sense of intimacy. The final 「ね」 softens the statement and seeks agreement, making it less assertive and more charming. This is a common tactic used by men to flirt with women."
