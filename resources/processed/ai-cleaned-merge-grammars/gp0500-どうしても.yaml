    "etymology": "「どうしても」 is derived from 「どう」 (how) + 「して」 (te-form of する, to do) + 「も」 (even). Literally, it means \"even if you do it how\", implying that no matter how you try, something will happen or you want to do something.",
    "writeup": "「どうしても」 functions primarily as an adverb, expressing a strong sense of \"no matter what,\" \"regardless of anything,\" or \"by all means.\" It conveys a determination to achieve something or the inevitability of a situation. It is often placed at the beginning of a sentence to emphasize the speaker's strong feeling or used after a verb followed by 「と」 to indicate an unavoidable consequence. Though translated literally as \"in any case\", the implication is a feeling of inevitability and/or determination.",
