        "どうしても": "Used as an adverb to express strong desire, determination, or an unavoidable outcome.",

        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "nuance": "Conveys strong determination, an unyielding desire, or an unavoidable/inevitable consequence. It implies that efforts to change the outcome are fruitless or that the speaker's will is resolute."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「どうしても」 is a compound derived from 「どう」 (dou, meaning 'how' or 'in what way') and the te-form of the verb 「する」 (suru, meaning 'to do'), 「して」, followed by the particle 「も」 (mo, meaning 'even' or 'also'). Thus, it literally translates to 'even if one does it in any way' or 'no matter how one does it,' encapsulating the sense of inevitability or strong resolve regardless of the circumstances or actions taken.",
    "writeup": "**どうしても** is an adverbial expression used to convey either a strong sense of **inevitability or unavoidability** or a feeling of **resolute determination or strong desire**. It can be understood as 'no matter what,' 'absolutely,' 'inevitably,' or 'by all means.' This versatility allows it to add significant emphasis and resolve to statements.When expressing **inevitability or unavoidability**, どうしても implies that a certain situation or outcome cannot be avoided, regardless of external factors or efforts. It suggests that a consequence is inherent to a particular condition or circumstance. For example, if you say 「疲れると、どうしても眠くなる」 (When I get tired, I inevitably get sleepy), it indicates that sleepiness is an unavoidable consequence of fatigue.When conveying **resolute determination or strong desire**, どうしても signifies an unwavering will to achieve something or a deep, unyielding desire for something to happen. It implies that the speaker will persist regardless of difficulties or that their desire is extremely strong. For instance, 「どうしても優勝したい」 (I absolutely want to win the championship) shows a powerful commitment to winning.This expression is highly versatile and can modify verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses, enriching the nuance of a sentence by highlighting the speaker's strong feeling about the certainty or necessity of an action or state.",
