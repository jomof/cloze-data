        "[Noun] + なしに": "Indicates something occurs without the presence of the noun.",
        "[Verb (dictionary form)] + こと + なしに": "Indicates something occurs without performing the specified action.",

        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Often used in formal writing and speech.",
        "function": "Indicates the absence of an action or thing.",
        "nuance": "This phrase carries a formal tone, similar to 'without' in English, and emphasizes the lack or absence of something or an action. It can imply impossibility or difficulty when used with a negative potential verb."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なしに」 comes from the adjective 「ない」 (nai, meaning 'not exist' or 'absent') and the particle 「に」 (ni, indicating circumstance or means). It evolved to denote a state of lacking something or performing an action in the absence of something else.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なしに」 is an adverbial phrase used to express the idea of 'without' something or 'without doing' something. It is generally considered more formal than its counterparts 「ないで」 and 「ずに」, making it suitable for written language, official documents, and more formal spoken contexts.\n\nIt can be used in several patterns:\n\n*   **Noun + なしに**: This is used to indicate that an action takes place in the absence of a specific noun. For example, 「許可 {なしに} 入る」 (kyoka nashi ni hairu) means \"to enter without permission.\"\n*   **Verb (dictionary form) + こと + なしに**: This pattern denotes performing an action without having done a prerequisite action. For instance, 「確認する こと {なしに} 提出する」 (kakunin suru koto nashi ni teishutsu suru) means \"to submit without confirming.\"\n*   **何の + Noun + も + なしに**: This emphasizes a complete lack or total absence of the noun. The 'も' particle here further highlights the inclusiveness of 'nothing at all'. For example, 「何の 連絡 も {なしに}」 (nan no renraku mo nashi ni) means \"without any contact whatsoever.\"\n*   **Noun / Verb (dictionary form) + こと + なしには + Negative Potential Verb**: This construction, 「～なしには～ない」, strongly implies that something is impossible or extremely difficult to achieve without the specified noun or action. It asserts a necessary condition. For example, 「努力 {なしには} 成功 できない」 (doryoku nashi ni wa seikō dekinai) means \"you cannot succeed without effort.\"\n\nWhile 「なしに」 conveys a similar meaning to 「ないで」 and 「ずに」, its formality and slightly stronger emphasis on the absolute absence or impossibility make it distinct. It often appears in more serious or official statements.",

While 「なしに」 can also take nouns, its nuance leans towards a more formal or absolute absence, especially when it's about a condition or permission that is lacking for an action to occur. 「なしで」 simply states the absence of something."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「なしに」, 「ないで」, 「ずに」, and 「なしで」 all convey the meaning of 'without,' their usage differs in formality and nuance. 「なしに」 often implies the absence of a prerequisite noun or action, emphasizing impossibility or the lack of a condition, especially in formal or written contexts. 「ないで」 connects two actions, where the first action is omitted while the second occurs, and is common in daily conversation. 「ずに」 is a more formal or literary equivalent to 「ないで」, often appearing in written Japanese. 「なしで」 is a general term for 'without a thing or person' and is often interchangeable with 「なしに」 when modifying a noun, but 「なしに」 can carry a more conditional or absolute connotation.
