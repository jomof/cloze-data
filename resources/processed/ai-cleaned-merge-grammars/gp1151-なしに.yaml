    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なしに」 indicates that something is done 'without' something else. It's similar to 「ないで」 and 「ずに」, but 「なしに」 is generally considered more formal and is often used in written language or formal speech.\n\nIt is usually structured in one of two ways:\n\n*   **Noun + なしに**: Used to indicate doing something without a particular noun.\n*   **Verb (dictionary form) + こと + なしに**: Used to indicate doing something without performing a particular action.\n\nIt can also be used in the form 「～なしには～ない」, indicating that something cannot be done without something else. For example, 「許可なしには入れません」 means \"You cannot enter without permission.\"",
