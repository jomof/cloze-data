formation:
  '[Sentence A]. しかも [Sentence B].': Used to add information that reinforces or further elaborates on
    the preceding statement, often with an element of surprise or emphasis.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The term 「しかも」 (shikamo) is thought to originate from a combination of 「しかる」 (shikaru), an
  old verb meaning "to be so" or "to be thus," and the conjunctive particle 「も」 (mo), meaning "also" or
  "even." Over time, this evolved to emphasize the additional nature of what is being stated. The "shikaru"
  component suggests a confirmation of the preceding statement, to which "mo" then adds further, often
  surprising or significant, information. This historical root clarifies why it carries a nuance of "not
  only that, but also" or "what's more," signifying an additive statement that is often unexpected or
  more profound than what was previously mentioned.
writeup: |-
  「しかも」 is a conjunctive adverb that connects two clauses or sentences. It is used to add further information, often a point that strengthens, deepens, or even adds an element of surprise or unexpectedness to the preceding statement. It can be translated as "moreover," "furthermore," "what's more," "and yet," or "besides."

  Unlike simple connectors like 「そして」 (soshite - and then) or 「また」 (mata - also), 「しかも」 implies a logical connection where the second clause adds significant weight or a surprising detail to the first. It often introduces a point that makes the previous statement even more remarkable, difficult, or impressive. For instance, if you say someone is smart, adding 「しかも優しい」 (shikamo yasashii - and what's more, kind) highlights that kindness is an additional, perhaps unexpected, positive trait.

  It can be used in both formal and casual contexts, though it tends to appear more frequently in written language or somewhat formal spoken Japanese. It is typically followed by a new sentence or clause.

  - term: その上 (on top of that・furthermore)
    meaning: on top of that・furthermore
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「その上」 is very similar to 「しかも」 and often interchangeable. However, 「その上」 generally indicates
      simple addition, while 「しかも」 can carry a stronger nuance of unexpectedness, emphasis, or an aggravating/exacerbating
      factor. 「その上」 is more straightforwardly "in addition."
    grammar_point: その上 (on top of that・furthermore)
  - term: おまけに (in addition・on top of that)
    meaning: in addition・on top of that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「おまけに」 is also additive, but it often implies a negative additional element or a slightly
      more casual tone. It can be used for positive additions too, but it often has a sense of "to make
      matters worse" or "as an extra bonus/detriment." 「しかも」 is more neutral but often points to a significant
      addition.
    grammar_point: おまけに (in addition・on top of that)
  - term: 更に (furthermore・still more)
    meaning: furthermore・still more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「更に」 (さらに) means "furthermore," "still more," or "again." It emphasizes an increase in degree,
      quantity, or continuance. While also additive, it's more about "more of the same" or "increasingly"
      rather than a surprisingly significant additional point like 「しかも」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:更に (furthermore・still more)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「しかも」, 「その上」, 「おまけに」, and 「更に」 all express the idea of adding information,
  their nuances differ subtly. 「しかも」 is generally used to introduce a significant or often surprising
  additional point that reinforces or elevates the previous statement. 「その上」 is a straightforward "in
  addition," while 「おまけに」 often carries a connotation of a bonus or a detrimental extra. 「更に」 focuses
  on continuation, increase, or intensification. Choosing the right one depends on the specific nuance
  you wish to convey about the relationship between the two pieces of information.
examples:
  - english: That restaurant is delicious, and what's more, it's cheap.
    japanese:
      - あの レストラン は 美味しい。{しかも} 安い。

          - あの レストラン は 美味しい。そして 安い。
        english: That restaurant is delicious, and it's cheap.
        hint: 「そして」 is a simple "and then" connector. 「しかも」 emphasizes that the cheapness is an additional,
          noteworthy point given its deliciousness. We're looking for an emphasized additional quality.

        hint: 「おまけに」 often implies "to make matters worse." While fitting here, 「しかも」 is more neutral
          and simply adds a significant aggravating factor. We're looking for a general strong additional
          point.

          additional quality.

          looking for an emphasized additional quality.
