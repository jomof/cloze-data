    "etymology": "「からして」 is derived from 「から」 (from) and the て-form of the verb 「する」 (to do). The literal sense is \"starting from,\" indicating a basis for judgment or emphasis. This evolution captures the idea of forming a judgment or conclusion directly 'from' a specific piece of information or 'starting with' a particular element, suggesting that this element is foundational or even the minimal indicator for the overall assessment.",
    "writeup": "**からして** combines the particle 「から」 (from) with the te-form of the verb 「する」 (to do). It is primarily used to express an opinion or judgment based on a particular piece of information or evidence. Think of it as \"judging from,\" \"based on,\" or even \"from the very...\" It implies that the speaker is making an assessment, relying heavily on the stated noun as a strong and often sufficient indicator. The nuance can also be one of emphasis, suggesting that if *even* this particular aspect is true, then a broader conclusion must also be true. For instance, if \"even the menu\" is elegant, then the entire restaurant must be elegant. While often appearing in polite speech, its usage extends to casual conversations as well, depending on the context and speaker's intent.",

It allows you to make clear, decisive judgments based on specific pieces of information, whether it's a person's behavior, an object's appearance, or an overall situation. Remember its dual nuance: it can simply mean 'judging from,' or it can add emphasis, implying 'even this minimal detail tells me everything I need to know.' Paying attention to the context will help you discern which nuance is stronger.",
