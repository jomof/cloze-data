    "writeup": "**からして** combines the particle 「から」 (from) with the te-form of the verb 「する」 (to do). It is used to express an opinion or judgment based on a particular piece of information or evidence. Think of it as \"judging from,\" \"based on,\" or \"even from.\" It implies that the speaker is making an assessment without complete information, relying on what's available. **からして** often carries the nuance that the available information likely represents the whole picture, but not always.",
