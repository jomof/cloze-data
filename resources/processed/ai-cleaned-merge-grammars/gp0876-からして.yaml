    "etymology": "「からして」 is derived from 「から」 (from) and the て-form of the verb 「する」 (to do). The literal sense is \"starting from,\" indicating a basis for judgment or emphasis.",
    "writeup": "**からして** combines the particle 「から」 (from) with the te-form of the verb 「する」 (to do). It is used to express an opinion or judgment based on a particular piece of information or evidence. Think of it as \"judging from,\" \"based on,\" or \"even from.\" It implies that the speaker is making an assessment without complete information, relying on what's available. **からして** often carries the nuance that the available information likely represents the whole picture, but not always.",

                    "competing_grammar": "値段で判断すると",
                    "mitigation": "The scene implies an immediate, intuitive judgment about the quality based directly on the price, rather than a formal 'judgment' process. 「からして」 better captures this direct inference."

                {
                    "competing_grammar": "値段が高いから",

            "listener_gender": "female",
            "speaker_age": "older",
            "etymology": "「値段」 means price. 「新鮮」 means fresh. 「食材」 means ingredient.",
            "nuance": "The sentence uses 「に違いない」 to express a strong belief based on the price, implying that higher prices suggest quality ingredients. The speaker, being older, offers an informed assessment to a younger listener, using 「からして」 to indicate the direct basis of his judgment."
