    "etymology": "とか is a combination of the particle と (used for quoting) and the particle か (indicating uncertainty or a question). This combination implies the information being presented is hearsay or not entirely confirmed.",
    "writeup": "とか combines the particles と and か to indicate that the speaker has heard something but is not entirely certain about its validity. It's similar to saying \"I heard something like (A)\" or \"(A) or something was said.\" It can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns in their plain form. This usage is common in casual conversation. Be mindful that this とか is different from the とか used to list items, though both originate from the combination of と and か and share a similar sense of non-exhaustiveness or uncertainty.",
