    "writeup": "The particle 「とか」 combines 「と」 (a quotative particle) and 「か」 (a particle indicating uncertainty). Thus, 「とか」 conveys that the speaker heard something but isn't entirely sure if it's true or accurate. It's similar to saying \"I heard something like...\" or \"...or something\" in English. It can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns.\n\nIt is often heard in everyday conversation and leans towards a fairly casual tone. It is important to note that while 「とか」 can also be used as a listing particle meaning \"and\" or \"or\" (e.g., \"do things like A or B\"), the current grammar point focuses on its function as a hearsay marker. While both usages originate from the combination of 「と」 and 「か」, their contextual applications are distinct.",
