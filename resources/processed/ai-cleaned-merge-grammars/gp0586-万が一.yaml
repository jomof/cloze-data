        "usage-context": "Used to highlight a precaution against a rare event or the consequence of such an event.",
        "function": "Emphasizes the low probability of an event while considering its potential impact or requiring preparation.",
        "nuance": "Implies a significant, often negative, but low-probability occurrence that warrants consideration or preventative action. Slightly stronger than 万一.",

    "etymology": "The term 「万が一」 literally means \"one in ten thousand.\" It comes from the idea of something being highly improbable, like winning the lottery or encountering a rare event. It emphasizes the low likelihood of something happening but still warrants preparation or consideration.",
    "writeup": "「万が一」, sometimes shortened to 「万一」, literally means \"one in ten thousand.\" It is used similarly to phrases like \"in the unlikely event of (A)\" or \"just in case (A)\" in English. It highlights a precaution against (A) or the consequence of (A). 「万が一」 is primarily used adverbially, often appearing at the beginning of sentences. Note that 「万が一」 is considered slightly stronger than 「万一」, although 「万が一」 is more common due to its ease of pronunciation. It's often used when discussing preparations for potential negative outcomes, even if highly improbable, or when expressing a low probability of a positive outcome, such as winning a lottery.",
