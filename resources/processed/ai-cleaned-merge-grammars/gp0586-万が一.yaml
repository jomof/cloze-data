    "etymology": "The term 「万が一」 literally means \"one in ten thousand.\" It comes from the idea of something being highly improbable, like winning the lottery or encountering a rare event. It emphasizes the low likelihood of something happening but still warrants preparation or consideration.",
    "writeup": "「万が一」, sometimes shortened to 「万一」, literally means \"1 in 10000.\" It is used similarly to phrases like \"in the unlikely event of (A)\" or \"just in case (A)\" in English. It highlights a precaution against (A) or the consequence of (A). 「万が一」 is primarily used adverbially, often appearing at the beginning of sentences. Note that 「万が一」 is considered slightly stronger than 「万一」, although 「万が一」 is more common due to its ease of pronunciation.",
