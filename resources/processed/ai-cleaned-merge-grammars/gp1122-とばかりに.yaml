    "etymology": "「とばかりに」 is derived from 「ばかり」, which means \"just\" or \"only,\" and 「に」, a particle indicating purpose or result. Together, they suggest that the action is done just to convey a particular meaning or intention. It's as if the person's actions are solely for the purpose of expressing something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「とばかりに」 is used to describe a situation where someone acts as if they are saying something, or as if they strongly believe or have decided something. It conveys the idea that their actions are a clear indication of their thoughts or intentions. It's often used to describe someone's behavior in a way that highlights their unspoken feelings or decisions. It's similar to \"as if to say\" or \"as if implying.\" It is primarily used in formal writing and speech. The expression is often used to add a sense of drama or exaggeration to the description.",

            "nuance": "「と言わんばかりに」 is very similar to 「とばかりに」, both conveying an unspoken message through action. However, 「と言わんばかりに」 often has a slightly stronger, more explicit, or sometimes critical nuance, literally meaning 'as if not to speak (but the message is clear)'. 「とばかりに」 is generally a more neutral description of an action conveying an intention.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「と言う」 simply means \"to say,\" 「とばかりに」 implies an unspoken message conveyed through actions. 「かのように」 and 「と言うように / と言う風に」 are similar in meaning to \"as if,\" but they are less about conveying a specific intention through action and more about indicating a resemblance or manner. To avoid confusion, remember that 「とばかりに」 is used when someone's actions are clearly intended to express something without words, often driven by an internal conviction. 「と言わんばかりに」 is a close synonym but can carry a slightly more intense or pointed nuance.",
