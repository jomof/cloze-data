        "function": "Expressing an action that conveys a particular meaning or intention.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the action is performed deliberately to suggest something to others."
    },
    "etymology": "「とばかりに」 is derived from 「ばかり」, which means \"just\" or \"only,\" and 「に」, a particle indicating purpose or result. Together, they suggest that the action is done just to convey a particular meaning or intention. It's as if the person's actions are solely for the purpose of expressing something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「とばかりに」 is used to describe a situation where someone acts **as if** they are saying something, or as if they strongly believe or have decided something. It conveys the idea that their actions are a clear indication of their thoughts or intentions. It's often used to describe someone's behavior in a way that highlights their unspoken feelings or decisions. It's similar to \"as if to say\" or \"as if implying.\" It is primarily used in formal writing and speech. The expression is often used to add a sense of drama or exaggeration to the description.",

                    "mitigation": "While 「と言わんばかりに」 is very similar, it often implies a more aggressive or confrontational silent message. 「とばかりに」 is suitable for conveying a strong, clear message through action without necessarily implying confrontation."
