        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Commonly employed in formal writing and speech, official announcements, academic texts, and business communications. It provides a more precise and definitive 'or' than alternatives."
    },
    "etymology": "「もしくは」 is derived from the classical Japanese verb 「申す」(mōsu), meaning 'to state' or 'to say' (in a humble or polite manner), combined with the conjunctive particle 「く」 and the topic marker 「は」. Originally, it conveyed a nuance of 'humble statement or alternative presentation,' evolving to its current meaning of a formal 'or' that suggests a choice between distinct options.",
    "writeup": "「もしくは」 serves as a formal conjunction meaning \"or.\" It is used to present two distinct items, ideas, or actions as alternatives, suggesting a choice between them. Unlike simpler alternatives like 「または」 or 「あるいは」, 「もしくは」 carries a distinctly formal tone, making it suitable for official documents, academic papers, legal texts, formal presentations, and polite business correspondence. It emphasizes that the connected elements are mutually exclusive options or that one is a substitute for the other. While 「または」 can also be formal, 「もしくは」 tends to imply a slightly stronger sense of selection or a more clearly defined set of alternatives.",

            "meaning": "or, alternatively",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「または」 is a general 'or' that can be used in both formal and informal contexts. While it can function formally, it lacks the specific emphasis on choice or distinct alternatives that 「もしくは」 often conveys. It's more versatile and less restrictive than 「もしくは」."
        },
        {
            "term": "あるいは",
            "meaning": "or, perhaps, possibly",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「あるいは」 falls between 「または」 and 「もしくは」 in formality. It can introduce an alternative, but it sometimes carries a nuance of 'perhaps' or 'possibly,' suggesting less certainty or a broader range of options compared to 「もしくは」. It's used in both written and spoken language but less frequently than 「または」."

            "term": "それとも",
            "meaning": "or else, alternatively (used in questions)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「それとも」 is exclusively used to present alternatives within an interrogative sentence (a question). It directly asks the listener to choose between options. 「もしくは」, in contrast, is used in declarative sentences (statements) to present alternatives or possibilities."

            "term": "か",
            "meaning": "or, question particle",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "The simple particle 「か」 can also mean 'or' when used to connect two items (e.g., AかBか). However, it is much more casual and informal than 「もしくは」 and is primarily used in direct speech or informal writing. It lacks the formality and specific emphasis of 「もしくは」, which is typically reserved for more formal or official contexts."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When faced with multiple ways to express \"or\" in Japanese, consider the context and desired nuance. 「または」 is the most widely applicable, suitable for most situations. 「あるいは」 can be a good intermediate choice, and might hint at a wider range of possibilities. 「それとも」 is specific to questions, prompting a choice. For formal, official, or highly structured contexts where distinct alternatives are being presented, 「もしくは」 is the most appropriate choice, conveying precision and a clear selection between options.",
