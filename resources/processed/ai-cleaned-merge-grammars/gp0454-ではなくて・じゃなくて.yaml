    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the negative form of the copula 「だ」 (to be), followed by the conjunctive particle 「て」. 「では」 is a more formal version, while 「じゃ」 is a colloquial contraction.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point ではなくて or じゃなくて is used to negate one thing and affirm another. It essentially means \"not A, but B.\" ではなくて is the more formal version, while じゃなくて is more casual.\n\nThis expression stems from the negative conjugated form of the auxiliary verb だ (to be). Specifically, ではなく is the conjunctive (く-form) of ではない, to which the conjunctive particle て is optionally attached. This structure indicates that a preceding element (A) is not the case, and instead, another element (B) is.\n\n**Structure**: This grammar point typically connects nouns, na-adjective stems, or phrases that have been nominalized through the use of の or こと (for verbs and i-adjectives).\n\n**Usage Nuances**: The adverbial particle は is not strictly required after the negated element (A). However, since this expression inherently compares what (A) is 'not' to what (B) 'is', the contrast that は provides makes the phrase sound far more natural with its inclusion.\n\n**Omission of て**: The particle て sometimes functions like a comma in Japanese, allowing elements to be linked that might not otherwise naturally connect. If て is omitted from ではなくて, resulting in ではなく, it may not link directly to the subsequent word, often necessitating a comma for clarity.\n\n**Adjectival Connection**: For adjectives, the く-form (e.g., 忙しく from 忙しい) is a conjunctive form. When used with ではなく, it acts as a linker, modifying or adding to the overall meaning of conjugatable words (用言) that follow.",
