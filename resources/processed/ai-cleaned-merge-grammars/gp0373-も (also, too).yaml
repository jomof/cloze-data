    "etymology": "The particle も evolved from the verb 「持つ (もつ)」, meaning \"to hold\" or \"to possess.\" Over time, its function shifted from indicating possession to indicating inclusion or addition, hence its current meaning of \"also\" or \"too.\"",
    "writeup": "も generally means \"too/also,\" \"even,\" or \"neither/either,\" depending on whether the sentence is affirmative or negative. Multiple meanings are common for Japanese particles, as there's no need to use different words simply to agree with other statements in the sentence, unlike English. English requires \"either/neither (when negative)\" or \"too/also,\" but Japanese only requires も. Think of it as simply meaning, \"Whatever is true for (A) is also true for (B).\" も is part of many other compound grammar structures where it keeps its original meaning but shifts the nuance a little. Some of these include でも, にも〜ない, とも. It's frequently paired with other particles!\n\nHere, も can pair with で. This suggests that \"With (A), (B) also.\" This is regularly translated as \"but\" in English, despite the nuance being closer to \"and also.\"",
