    "etymology": "も is believed to have originated from the verb 「持つ (もつ)」, meaning \"to hold\" or \"to possess.\" Over time, it evolved to express the idea of something being added or included, hence its current meaning of \"also\" or \"too.\"",
    "writeup": "も indicates that something else is also the case, or that a condition applies to an additional item. Its precise translation shifts depending on whether the sentence is affirmative or negative. In English, this often requires different words like \"too/also\" for affirmative statements, or \"neither/either\" for negative ones. However, in Japanese, も serves all these functions.\n\nFundamentally, you can interpret も as conveying the idea: \"Whatever is true for (A), is also true for (B).\"\n\nThis particle frequently appears in compound grammar structures, such as でも, にも〜ない, and とも. While these combinations subtly shift the overall nuance, the core meaning of も—that of addition or inclusion—remains consistent.",
