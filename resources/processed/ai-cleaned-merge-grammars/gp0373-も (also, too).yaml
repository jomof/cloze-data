    "etymology": "「も」 is believed to have originated from the verb 「持つ (もつ)」, meaning \"to hold\" or \"to possess.\" Over time, it evolved to express the idea of something being added or included, hence its current meaning of \"also\" or \"too.\"",
    "writeup": "「も」 indicates that something else is also the case, or that a condition applies to an additional item. Its precise translation shifts depending on whether the sentence is affirmative or negative. In English, this often requires different words like \"too/also\" for affirmative statements, or \"neither/either\" for negative ones. However, in Japanese, 「も」 serves all these functions.\n\nFundamentally, you can interpret 「も」 as conveying the idea: \"Whatever is true for (A), is also true for (B).\"\n\nThis particle frequently appears in compound grammar structures, such as 「でも」, 「にも〜ない」, and 「とも」. While these combinations subtly shift the overall nuance, the core meaning of 「も」—that of addition or inclusion—remains consistent.",

            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「も」, 「と」 connects nouns and lists all items, often implying an exhaustive list, while 「も」 implies addition or inclusion of something else, often to an existing context."

            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「も」, 「は」 sets the topic or highlights a contrast, but does not inherently imply addition or inclusion. When used contrastively, it highlights what is *not* true for other items, which is opposite to 「も」's additive nature."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「も」 and 「と」 can both connect elements in a sentence, their usage differs. Use 「と」 when creating an exhaustive list or when explicitly linking nouns: 「りんご と みかん」 (apples *and* oranges—often implying that these are the only items). Use 「も」 when adding something to a previously mentioned item or situation, conveying the sense of \"also\" or \"too\": 「りんご も みかん も」 (apples *and* oranges *too*—implying that other items might also be involved or that both share a characteristic).\n\nAdditionally, 「も」 differs from 「は」. While 「は」 marks the topic or highlights a contrast, it does not inherently mean 'also' or 'too'. For instance, 「私は学生です」 (I am a student) states a fact about the speaker. If another person is also a student, you would say 「彼も学生です」 (He is *also* a student). If you said 「彼は学生です」, it would simply state his profession without linking it to someone else's.",
