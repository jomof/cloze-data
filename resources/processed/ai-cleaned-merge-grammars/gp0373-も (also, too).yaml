    "etymology": "も is believed to have originated from the verb 「持つ (もつ)」, meaning \"to hold\" or \"to possess.\" Over time, it evolved to express the idea of something being added or included, hence its current meaning of \"also\" or \"too.\"",
    "writeup": "も indicates that something else is also the case. It can mean \"also/too,\" \"even,\" or \"neither/either,\" depending on whether the sentence is affirmative or negative. Multiple meanings are common for Japanese particles. English requires \"either/neither (when negative),\" or \"too/also,\" but Japanese only requires も. Think of it as meaning \"Whatever is true for (A), is also true for (B).\" も is part of many compound grammar structures where it keeps its original meaning but shifts the nuance. Some of these include でも, にも〜ない, and とも. As you can see, it's frequently paired with other particles!",
