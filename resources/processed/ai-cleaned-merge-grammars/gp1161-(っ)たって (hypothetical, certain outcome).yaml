    "etymology": "「(っ)たって」 is an informal contraction of 「〜ても」, which combines the past tense auxiliary verb 「た」 with the conjunctive particle 「って」, a colloquial form of 「ても」. The additional 「っ」 can add emphasis or be omitted depending on the speaker's preference.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「(っ)たって」 is a colloquial equivalent of 「ても」, expressing \"even if,\" \"even though,\" or \"no matter how.\" It's primarily used in casual conversation to emphasize that a particular result will occur irrespective of the condition being stated. This structure is commonly used to dismiss a condition as irrelevant to the final outcome, indicating a sense of resignation or inevitability. It is not typically used in formal writing or speech.\n\n「(っ)たって」 can be attached to various word types: verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. Its usage extends to both affirmative and negative hypothetical conditions, making it a versatile informal expression. The optional small 「っ」, which indicates a glottal stop or doubled consonant sound, can add emphasis, but its omission does not change the meaning.",

Use 「ても」 in business settings, formal writing, or when addressing someone of higher status. Choosing 「(っ)たって」 in a formal situation would sound too casual and might be considered inappropriate. Similarly, 「たところで」 shares the idea of a hypothetical condition, but it adds a strong nuance of futility or that the action will not change the outcome. This is a stronger, more negative connotation compared to the neutral concessive meaning of 「(っ)たって」.",
