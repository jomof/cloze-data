    "etymology": "「(っ)たって」 is an informal contraction of 「〜ても」, which combines the past tense auxiliary verb 「た」 with the conjunctive particle 「って」, a colloquial form of 「ても」. The additional 「っ」 can add emphasis or be omitted depending on the speaker's preference.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「(っ)たって」 is a colloquial equivalent of 「ても」, expressing \"even if,\" \"even though,\" or \"no matter how.\" It's primarily used in casual conversation to emphasize that a particular result will occur irrespective of the condition being stated. This structure is commonly used to dismiss a condition as irrelevant to the final outcome, indicating a sense of resignation or inevitability. It is not typically used in formal writing or speech.\n\n「(っ)たって」 can be attached to various word types: verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. Its usage extends to both affirmative and negative hypothetical conditions, making it a versatile informal expression. The optional small 「っ」, which indicates a glottal stop or doubled consonant sound, can add emphasis, but its omission does not change the meaning.",
