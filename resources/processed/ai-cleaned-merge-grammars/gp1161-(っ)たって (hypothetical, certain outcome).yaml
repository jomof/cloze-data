    "etymology": "「(っ)たって」 is an informal contraction of 「〜ても」, which combines the past tense auxiliary verb 「た」 with the conjunctive particle 「って」, a colloquial form of 「ても」. The additional 「っ」 can add emphasis or be omitted depending on the speaker's preference.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「(っ)たって」 is a colloquial equivalent of 「ても」, expressing \"even if,\" \"even though,\" or \"no matter how.\" It's primarily used in casual conversation to emphasize that a particular result will occur irrespective of the condition being stated. This structure is commonly used to dismiss a condition as irrelevant to the final outcome, indicating a sense of resignation or inevitability. It is not typically used in formal writing or speech. Like 「ても」, 「(っ)たって」 can be attached to verbs, adjectives, and nouns, with slight variations in conjugation.\n\n*   **Verbs:** Use the past tense (た form) of the verb + 「って」\n*   **い-adjectives:** Drop the い and add 「くたって」\n*   **な-adjectives/Nouns:** Add 「だって」",
