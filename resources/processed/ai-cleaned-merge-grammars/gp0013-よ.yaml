        "usage-context": "Primarily used in informal or casual settings to convey new information, assert an opinion, or give a strong suggestion.",
        "function": "To add emphasis, inform the listener of new information, or assert the speaker's opinion or decision.",
        "nuance": "Carries a sense of informing, asserting, or drawing the listener's attention to something the speaker considers important or new to them. Can sometimes imply a slight presumption that the listener is unaware of the information.",

    "etymology": "The origins of よ are not definitively known, but it's believed to have evolved from older forms of Japanese sentence-ending particles. Its function has remained consistent over time: to add emphasis or assert information. It's a very fundamental particle, reflecting its long history in the language.",
    "writeup": "よ is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese, primarily used to convey new information to the listener or to add emphasis. It is typically affixed to the end of a sentence. While its primary function is to inform, よ is frequently combined with ね to seek agreement or confirmation, such as in 「〜ですよね」, which conveys a sense of \"I think (A), and I expect you agree (A).\" It is crucial to remember that the copula だ precedes よ when attached to nouns or な-adjectives in plain form, a rule consistent with general Japanese conjugation, not unique to よ. Furthermore, ですよ can be used with all parts of speech to maintain politeness.",
