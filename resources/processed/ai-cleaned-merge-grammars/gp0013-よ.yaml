    "etymology": "The origins of 「よ」 are not definitively known, but it's believed to have evolved from older forms of Japanese sentence-ending particles. Its function has remained consistent over time: to add emphasis or assert information. It's a very fundamental particle, reflecting its long history in the language.",
    "writeup": "「よ」is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese. It is used to convey new information to the listener or to add emphasis. Like most sentence-ending particles, it's added to the end of a sentence. The standard use of 「よ」 is to convey new information, but it is also often paired with 「ね」to convey the meaning of \"right?!\". This more literally means something closer to \"I think (A), and I bet you think (A) too!\". Be aware that there is a 「だ」after the noun, but not the い-adjective. This is not a unique rule for 「よ」, but just one of the regular conjugation rules introduced in the lessons for い-adjectives and な-adjectives. It is also acceptable to use 「ですよ」after either type of adjective (or noun).",
