formation:
  Verb ます-stem + つつ(も): Indicates doing one thing while or despite doing another; often implies an internal
    conflict or contradiction.
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: formal/literary context
  function: Connects two clauses, where the second clause expresses a result or action contradictory to
    what one might expect from the first clause.
  nuance: Emphasizes a contradiction or internal conflict. Often used with non-physical actions or states,
    such as knowing, thinking, or feeling. It carries a more formal or literary tone than ながらも.
etymology: 「つつ」 is derived from the verb 「つむ」, meaning 'to continue' or 'to repeat'. Adding 「も」 emphasizes
  the sense of 'even' or 'despite', highlighting the contrast between the actions. This form implies a
  continuous or ongoing state or action in the first clause that stands in contradiction to the second
  clause.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「{つつ(も)}」 is used to express that an action or state is occurring, or a fact is known, despite a contradiction or internal conflict. It conveys meanings such as "even while ~ing," "even though ~ing," "despite ~ing," or "although ~ing."

  At its core, 「つつ」 indicates a continuous action or state, similar to 「ながら」. The addition of 「も」 emphasizes a sense of "even" or "despite," highlighting a contrast. The second clause (B) will almost always present something that is contradictory to the first clause (A). This contradiction can be an internal conflict, an unexpected outcome, or an action taken despite knowledge.

  「{つつ(も)}」 attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. It is typically used for non-physical actions or ongoing mental states, such as thinking, knowing, reading, or watching. For physical actions, 「ながらも」 is generally more natural. For example, one might say 「知りつつも」 (even while knowing) but less commonly 「走りつつも」 (even while running), preferring 「走りながらも」 instead.

  「{つつ(も)}」 is considered more formal than 「ながらも」 and is often encountered in written Japanese or more formal speech. It conveys a deeper sense of internal conflict or a more deliberate action taken despite contrary feelings or knowledge.

  - term: ものの
    meaning: Although, But, Even Though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ものの」 can connect clauses with contrasting ideas but doesn't necessarily imply simultaneous
      action or an internal conflict as strongly as 「{つつ(も)}」.
    grammar_point: ものの (although・but)
  - term: くせに
    meaning: Even though, And yet, Despite
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「くせに」 carries a sense of blame or resentment, implying a negative judgment about the contradiction,
      while 「{つつ(も)}」 is more neutral and factual.
    grammar_point: くせに (despite and yet)
  - term: ながらも
    meaning: But, Even while, Even though, Despite, Although
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ながらも」 is very similar in meaning, but 「{つつ(も)}」 implies a more conscious awareness of the
      contradiction or is often used with non-physical, mental actions, whereas 「ながらも」 can be used more
      broadly, including for physical actions.
    grammar_point: ながらも (even though)
  - term: ても
    meaning: Even if, even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ても」 expresses a concession, meaning 'even if' or 'even though', but it does not inherently
      imply the continuous or ongoing nature of the first clause's action or state, nor the internal conflict
      often present with 「{つつ(も)}」.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 「ものの」, 「くせに」, 「ながらも」, and 「ても」 can convey similar ideas
  of contrast, their nuances differ significantly. 「ものの」 is a more general conjunction for contradiction.
  「くせに」 carries a critical or accusatory tone, implying that the action or state is improper given the
  circumstances. 「ながらも」 is perhaps the closest in meaning to 「{つつ(も)}」, but 「{つつ(も)}」 tends to emphasize
  an internal, often psychological, contradiction or a more formal, literary context, especially with
  non-physical actions. 「ても」 expresses a general 'even if' or 'even though' without the emphasis on a
  continuous state or internal conflict that 「{つつ(も)}」 conveys.

        english: Even while accepting the advice, he stepped into a dangerous place.
        hint: While ながらも can indicate simultaneous action or slight contrast, つつも more strongly implies
          a persistent internal state or knowledge that conflicts with the action taken.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 忠告 を 聞き入れ て も、彼 は 危険 な 場所 へ と 足 を 踏み入れ た。
        english: Even if he accepted the advice, he stepped into a dangerous place.
        hint: ても expresses a hypothetical 'even if' condition, not the continuous 'even while' action
          or internal conflict of つつも.
    scene: A young explorer, despite being warned about a treacherous path, decides to venture forward
      alone.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: storytelling
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「聞き入れつつも」 highlights the character's internal decision to proceed despite having
      processed and accepted the warnings (`忠告`). This demonstrates a conscious disregard of advice, emphasizing
      the contradiction.
    etymology: The phrase 「足 を 踏み入れる」 (to step into) is a common idiomatic expression used to describe
      entering a place or getting involved in a situation, often one that is new, unknown, or potentially
      dangerous.

        english: I am nervous about my new job, but every day is fulfilling.
        hint: While が simply connects two contrasting ideas, つつも emphasizes that the second state exists
          despite the continuous first state.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい 仕事 に 緊張 し て も、毎日 充実 し て いる。
        english: Even if I am nervous about my new job, every day is fulfilling.
        hint: ても sounds like a hypothetical 'even if', rather than the continuous 'even while' that つつも
          implies regarding the speaker's nervousness.
    scene: A new employee, feeling the pressure of their responsibilities, shares their overall positive
      experience with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The speaker admits to an ongoing state of nervousness (`緊張しつつも`) but stresses that the new
      job is ultimately rewarding (`毎日充実している`). This showcases a personal, internal contradiction that
      resolves positively.
    etymology: 「充実」 (juujitsu) means 'fullness' or 'completion' and implies a sense of satisfaction and
      productivity, often used to describe a fulfilling life or day.

        english: Even if he had injured his leg, he continued to practice.
        hint: ても implies a more hypothetical or general 'even if', whereas つつも suggests the continuous
          state of being injured while practicing.
    scene: A dedicated athlete pushing through an injury during training. This specific example is included
      to illustrate that 「つつも」 is generally less natural for physical actions or states compared to 「ながらも」,
      despite being grammatically possible.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: This sentence uses 「{つつも}」 for a physical state (`足に怪我をしている`) which sounds less natural than
      「ながらも」. 「つつも」 is typically reserved for non-physical, mental states or actions, or in more formal/literary
      contexts for non-physical concepts.
    etymology: 「練習 を 続ける」 (renshuu o tsuzukeru) literally means 'to continue practice', emphasizing perseverance
      and dedication in training.

        english: I had doubts about his words and actions, but I accepted his proposal.
        hint: つつも highlights a continuous, internal state of doubt (`疑問を抱き`) that is present even while
          another action (`受け入れた`) is performed. が simply shows a contrast.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 言動 に 疑問 を 抱い て も、私 は 彼 の 提案 を 受け入れ た。
        english: Even if I had doubts about his words and actions, I accepted his proposal.
        hint: ても conveys a general 'even if' condition, while つつも emphasizes the ongoing internal state
          of doubt coexisting with the acceptance.
    scene: Someone making a difficult decision to trust another person despite some reservations.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The speaker's internal state of doubt (`疑問を抱きつつも`) is directly contrasted with their external
      action of acceptance (`提案を受け入れた`). This highlights a deliberate choice made despite conflicting
      feelings, a common use case for 「つつも」.
    etymology: 「疑問 を 抱く」 (gimon o idaku) literally means 'to embrace doubts,' suggesting that one harbors
      or holds onto a feeling of uncertainty or suspicion.

          highlights the state of being sufficient that existed concurrently with the failure.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 準備 は 十分 で あっ て も、実験 は 失敗 に 終わっ た。
        english: Even if preparations were sufficient, the experiment ended in failure.
        hint: ても focuses on a hypothetical 'even if' scenario, not the factual, ongoing state of sufficiency
          that existed and was contradicted by the failure, as implied by つつも.
    scene: A scientist reflecting on a project that unexpectedly didn't achieve its goal.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This example shows 「{つつも}」 used for a past state of thorough preparation (`準備は十分であったつつも`)
      that unexpectedly led to a failure (`失敗に終わった`). This illustrates a common application for emphasizing
      an outcome that contradicts expectations, especially in academic or professional contexts.
    etymology: 「失敗 に 終わる」 (shippai ni owaru) literally means 'to end in failure,' a common phrasing to
      describe the conclusion of an endeavor with an unsuccessful outcome.

          the speaker's inability to act. が simply shows a contrast.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 健康 の ため に 運動 が 大切 だ と 分かっ て い て も、なかなか 実行 に 移せ ない。
        english: Even if I understand that exercise is important for health, I can't seem to put it into
          practice.
        hint: ても indicates a hypothetical concession, whereas つつも stresses the continuous presence of
          the understanding despite the inability to act.
    scene: Someone discussing their personal struggle with maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The speaker acknowledges the importance of exercise (`運動が大切だと分かりつつも`) but admits to a personal
      struggle in actually doing it (`なかなか実行に移せない`). This highlights a common internal conflict between
      intention and behavior.

      the transition from thought or plan to action.

        english: Even while acknowledging the danger, the explorer advanced into the forbidden land.
        hint: つつも implies a deeper, more conscious awareness of the danger that is being continuously
          held even as the action proceeds. ながらも can also express this but つつも is more formal.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 危険 を 承知 し て も、探求 者 は 禁断 の 地 へ と 進ん で いっ た。
        english: Even if he acknowledged the danger, the explorer advanced into the forbidden land.
        hint: ても signifies 'even if' or 'even though' in a more general sense, lacking the continuous

        english: The researcher knows the probability of success is low, but he continued to pursue the
          new theory.
        hint: つつも specifically highlights the researcher's continued internal awareness of the low probability
          while they kept pursuing the theory. が offers a less nuanced contrast.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 成功 の 可能 性 が 低い と 分かっ て い て も、研究 者 は 新しい 理論 を 追求 し 続け た。
        english: Even if he knew the probability of success was low, the researcher continued to pursue
          the new theory.

          awareness of the low probability that existed concurrently with the pursuit.
    scene: An academic presenting a case study of a scientist's perseverance despite long odds.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This example demonstrates the use of 「{つつも}」 for emphasizing perseverance in academic research.
      The researcher's full awareness of low success probability (`可能性が低いと分かりつつも`) is contrasted with
      their continued dedication (`追求し続けた`). The context suggests an older, experienced speaker.
    etymology: 「追求 し 続ける」 (tsuikyū shi tsuzukeru) means 'to continue to pursue', highlighting ongoing
      effort and determination towards a goal.

        english: The old bridge looked like it was about to collapse, but it withstood the heavy rain.
        hint: つつも describes the continuous state of appearing about to collapse, despite which it endured.

          - 崩れ そう に なっ て い て も、古い 橋 は 大雨 に 耐え た。
        english: Even if the old bridge looked like it was about to collapse, it withstood the heavy rain.
        hint: ても conveys a general 'even if' concession. つつも specifically highlights the continuous appearance
          of near-collapse that existed simultaneously with its resistance to the rain.
    scene: Describing a precarious structure, like an old bridge, that surprisingly endures a natural
      disaster.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The bridge's state of being on the verge of collapse (`崩れそうになりつつも`) is dramatically contrasted
      with its unexpected resilience (`大雨に耐えた`). This use of 「つつも」 adds tension and surprise to the description.
    etymology: 「～そうになる」 (sou ni naru) attached to a verb indicates that something looks like it's about
      to happen or is on the verge of occurring.
  - english: Even though you know I like you, why do you sometimes ignore me?
    japanese:

        english: Even though I like you, why do you sometimes ignore me (to my disappointment)?
        hint: つつも emphasizes the continuous awareness of the first clause's truth. のに is more accusatory,

          - 僕 が 君 の こと を 好き だ と 知っ て い て も、時々 無視 する の は なぜ？
        english: Even if you know I like you, why do you sometimes ignore me?
        hint: ても implies a general 'even if' condition. つつも emphasizes the ongoing, continuous state of
          knowing that is contradicted by the ignoring behavior.
    scene: A young man playfully questioning his girlfriend's behavior.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The male speaker uses 「知りつつも」 to highlight the female listener's continuous awareness of his
      affection (`僕が君のことを好きだと知りつつも`). The question `時々無視するのはなぜ？` then points out the playful contradiction,
      common in flirty, intimate conversations between younger people. The use of 「僕」 and 「君」 reinforces
      the casual tone.
    etymology: 「無視 する」 (mushi suru) means 'to ignore' or 'to disregard', stemming from '無' (mu, nothing)
      and '視' (shi, to see).

        hint: つつも stresses that the bewilderment is an ongoing internal state coexisting with the enjoyment.
          が provides a straightforward contrast between two facts.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 初めて の 経験 に 戸惑っ て い て も、彼 は 新しい 世界 を 楽しん で いる。
        english: Even if he is bewildered by the new experience, he is enjoying the new world.
        hint: ても indicates a hypothetical concession. つつも implies that the bewilderment is an ongoing,
          continuous feeling that exists simultaneously with the enjoyment.
    scene: A young person navigating a completely new environment and finding joy in it despite initial
      confusion.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: optimistic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: This sentence illustrates a character's ability to find enjoyment (`新しい世界を楽しんでいる`) despite
      initial confusion or bewilderment (`戸惑いつつも`) in a new situation. The use of `彼` suggests a third-person
      narrative, often used by a female speaker in storytelling or informative contexts.
    etymology: 「戸惑う」 (tomadou) means 'to be bewildered' or 'to be perplexed', implying a state of being
      lost or disoriented, often in a new or unfamiliar situation.
post_example_writeup: 「{つつ(も)}」 is used to express a sense of doing something despite knowing or feeling
  something contradictory. It carries a more formal tone and is often used in writing or more formal speech.
  The specific context determines whether the emphasis is on the simultaneous nature of the actions or
  the contradictory aspect.
