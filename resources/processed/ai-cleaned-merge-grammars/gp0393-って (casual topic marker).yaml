jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: casual
  particle-syntactic-function: topic
  particle-pragmatic-function: emphasis
  usage-context: General usage
  function: Used to introduce a topic in casual conversation, similar to は but with a more informal nuance.
    It can also imply a slight emphasis or a shift in focus to the topic.
etymology: The particle 「って」 is a colloquial contraction of 「とは」, where 「と」 is the quotation particle
  and 「は」 is the topic marker. Over time, its use expanded from quoting to also marking topics directly,
  especially in casual speech.
writeup: 「って」 is a versatile particle primarily used in spoken Japanese as a casual substitute for the
  topic marker 「は」. It carries the nuance of "as for" or "speaking of." It's important to note that this
  usage is informal and should be reserved for casual conversations. Think of it as a more relaxed way
  to introduce a topic compared to the more formal 「は」. Be cautious using 「って」 in formal settings, though
  it can appear in semi-formal contexts when combined with polite language. It is generally used when
  the speaker wants to highlight or introduce a subject in a conversational, often emphatic, manner.

  - term: なんか・なんて
    meaning: Such as, Things like, Emphasis
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「なんか」 and 「なんて」 can introduce a topic, they often carry an additional nuance of uncertainty
      or understatement that 「って」 lacks. They can also express a dismissive or negative feeling towards
      the topic. 「って」 is more neutral in its emphasis on the topic.
    grammar_point: 〜など・〜なんか (listing examples)
  - term: は
    meaning: As for... (Highlights sentence topic)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「は」 is a standard and generally more formal topic marker, appropriate for all contexts, including
      written and formal speech. 「って」 is its casual, spoken counterpart, primarily used in informal settings.
      While 「は」 can imply contrast, 「って」 in this usage simply introduces the topic without that implication.
    grammar_point: は (topic and contrast)
  - term: と言えば
    meaning: Speaking of, If it were the case that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「と言えば」 explicitly indicates a connection to a previously mentioned topic, often prompting
      further discussion or elaboration. It's more about 'speaking of X, that reminds me of...' In contrast,
      「って」 simply introduces a topic, which may or may not have been previously mentioned, and is less
      about shifting the conversation due to a reminder.
    grammar_point: と言えば・と言うと・と言ったら (speaking of)
  - term: って (quotation marker・casual)
    meaning: Casual quotation
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: '「って」 as a topic marker introduces the subject of a sentence. In contrast, 「って」 as a quotation
      marker indicates that the preceding statement is a quote, thought, or reported information. The
      key distinction lies in what precedes 「って」: a noun or noun phrase for topic marking, versus a full
      clause for quotation.'
    grammar_point: って (quotation marker, casual)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'While 「って」, 「は」, 「なんか」, 「なんて」, and 「と言えば」 can all introduce topics or relate
  to them, it''s important to consider the context and desired nuance. 「って」 is primarily a casual substitute
  for 「は」. 「なんか」 and 「なんて」 add nuances of vagueness or dismissal, and 「と言えば」 signals a shift to a related
  but distinct topic. The other crucial point is to distinguish this topic-marking 「って」 from the quotation
  「って」 by observing what precedes it: a noun for topic, a clause for quotation.'

      verb 「飲まれますか」 (nomaremasu ka) is used to politely inquire about the listener's drinking habits without
      directly asking 'do you drink?'. This phrasing balances casual topic introduction with polite inquiry,
      suitable for a male speaker on a first date with a female listener.

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The highly informal 「お前」 (omae) used by a younger male speaker to another male listener signifies
      a very close, casual friendship. 「って」 emphasizes the listener as the topic of this enthusiastic
      observation. The exclamation 「元気だな！」 (genki da na!) reinforces the casual and familiar tone between
      them.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「って」 primarily functions to introduce a topic in a casual,
  conversational tone, often carrying a nuance of drawing attention to that topic. While it most frequently
  appears in fully casual settings, its use can extend to slightly more polite (semi-formal) contexts
  when combined with appropriate polite verb conjugations or honorifics, allowing for a nuanced expression
  of topic introduction.
