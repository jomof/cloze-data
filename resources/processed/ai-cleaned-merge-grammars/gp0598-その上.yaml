    "etymology": "「その (sono)」 means \"that\" and 「上 (ue)」 means \"top\". Therefore, 「その上」 literally translates to \"on top of that\". It is used to add more information to a previous statement.",
    "writeup": "その上 (sono ue) is a formal expression in Japanese, functioning as a conjunction to introduce additional information or an emphatic statement. It translates to \"besides,\" \"in addition,\" or \"furthermore\" in English. It connects two related ideas, with the second sentence building upon the first, providing additional reasons or details. While 「その上」 leans toward formal contexts, it's still common in everyday conversations when you want to emphasize that something is 'in addition' to the previous point.",
