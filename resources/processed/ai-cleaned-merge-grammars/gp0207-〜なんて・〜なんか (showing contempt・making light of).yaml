etymology: 「なんて」 is a contraction of 「などという」 (nado to iu, "to say such things as") or 「なんという」 (nan to
  iu, "what a..."). 「なんか」 is a more colloquial contraction of 「などか」 or 「なにがしか」 (both related to "something
  like that" or "somehow"). The root 「など」 inherently implies "such as" or "among other things," leading
  to its use for providing examples. When used with a strong emotional tone, these forms evolved to convey
  emphasis, often negative, signifying "something like *that* (and nothing more important)" or "what kind
  of (unbelievable/contemptible thing)!" This evolution from a descriptive "such as" to an emotive "such
  a (trivial/awful) thing" highlights how linguistic particles can acquire pragmatic functions through
  frequent use in emotionally charged contexts.
writeup: |-
  「〜なんて」 and 「〜なんか」 are versatile, casual particles primarily used to express a speaker's strong emotional reaction, often disdain, contempt, surprise, or belittlement towards the preceding word or statement. While their basic meaning can be similar to 「など」 (and the listing 「なんか」), which simply lists examples, 「なんて」 and 「なんか」 inject a significant emotional component.

  When used to belittle or express contempt, they imply that the speaker considers the subject trivial, unworthy, or ridiculous. For example, if someone says 「英語なんて簡単だ」 (Eigo nante kantan da), they are not just saying "English is easy"; they are implying "English, *of all things*, is easy" or "English is *just* easy," perhaps with a dismissive or even arrogant tone.

  They can attach to nouns, verbs (plain form), い-adjectives (plain form), な-adjectives (plain form), or even entire sentences (plain form). The choice between 「なんて」 and 「なんか」 is largely stylistic and regional, with 「なんか」 often feeling slightly more informal or rough.

  - term: 〜など・〜なんか
    meaning: listing examples, such as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike this grammar point which expresses disdain or surprise, 「など」 and 「なんか」 in this usage
      simply provide examples without strong emotional connotation. We're looking for a grammar point
      that expresses a negative reaction to the thing being mentioned, not just listing it.
    grammar_point: 〜など・〜なんか (listing examples)
  - term: しか〜ない
    meaning: only, nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「しか〜ない」 strictly limits quantity or scope, 「なんて/なんか」 implies something is trivial or
      unimportant, which can sometimes convey a similar sense of "only just this." However, 「しか〜ない」 is
      a more objective limitation, whereas 「なんて/なんか」 is subjective and emotional. We're looking for an
      emotional dismissal, not a factual limitation.
    grammar_point: しか〜ない (only, nothing but)
  - term: 〜なんて (what a...!)
    meaning: what a...!, how...! (expressing strong surprise, sometimes admiration)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This use of 「なんて」 conveys strong surprise or exclamation, which can be positive or negative.
      The current grammar point focuses specifically on belittling or contempt. While both are emotive,
      the specific *type* of emotion differs. We're looking for a way to show something is trivial or
      contemptible, not just surprising.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜なんて (what a...!)
  - term: ばかり (only・just, often with nuance of excess)
    meaning: only; just; (implying excess)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ばかり」 focuses on exclusivity or often, excessive focus on one thing. While it can imply a
      sense of "just this one trivial thing," it lacks the inherent emotional charge of disdain or contempt
      found in 「なんて/なんか」. We're looking for a way to express belittlement, not merely a limited scope.
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・just, often with nuance of excess)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  It is crucial to differentiate 「〜なんて」 and 「〜なんか」 (contempt/belittling) from their homophonous counterparts. When used simply for listing examples, 「〜など」 and 「〜なんか」 function neutrally, like "and so on" or "such as." For instance, 「野菜など食べない」 (Yasai nado tabenai) means "I don't eat vegetables, etc.," merely providing an example, whereas 「野菜なんて食べない」 (Yasai nante tabenai) means "I wouldn't eat *something like* vegetables!" implying strong dislike or disdain.
  Furthermore, 「なんて」 can be used as an exclamation to express strong, sometimes even positive, surprise or admiration, as in 「なんて美しいんだろう！」 (Nante utsukushii n darou!) meaning "How beautiful it is!" This differs from its belittling use where the emotion is typically negative or dismissive. The key is to pay attention to the context and the speaker's tone. The nuance of belittling or contempt usually comes through a slightly condescending or exasperated tone.
