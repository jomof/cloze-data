details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: casual
  particle-pragmatic-function: emphasis
  usage-context: Primarily used in casual conversation to express dismissiveness, contempt, strong surprise,
    or disbelief towards something. It implies the speaker views the item or action as trivial, undesirable,
    or unexpected.
  function: Expresses subjective emotional reactions, such as disdain, shock, or trivialization.
  nuance: 「なんか」 often implies slight contempt, dismissal, or downplaying (e.g., 'such a trivial thing').
    It suggests that the speaker considers the preceding item or concept to be of little importance or
    value. 「なんて」 can express strong surprise, disbelief, or contempt, often in a rhetorical sense (e.g.,
    'How could something like that...!'). It highlights an unexpected or outrageous quality of the preceding
    item or action. Both forms are colloquial and add a strong subjective tone.
  colocation: Often precedes negative expressions or exclamations. Frequently used with nouns, plain form
    verbs, and plain form i- and na-adjectives.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a particle that adds emotional or attitudinal coloring to the preceding
    word or phrase. It is not a case-marking particle, but rather a pragmatic one.
  logical-flow: Introduces something that the speaker views as inconsequential, surprising, or contemptible,
    leading to a dismissive or emotional conclusion.
  temporal-flow: Does not inherently denote temporal flow, but can be used in contexts describing past
    events or future possibilities to color the speaker's attitude towards them.
  spatial-flow: Does not inherently denote spatial flow, but can be used to express an attitude towards
    an item's existence or location.
etymology: The colloquial forms 「なんか」 and 「なんて」 evolved from the more neutral particle 「など」. This evolution
  likely occurred through phonetic shifts and the addition of emphatic elements, allowing for the expression
  of stronger subjective feelings such as disdain, surprise, or dismissiveness. While 「など」 historically
  indicated 'things of that kind' neutrally, 「なんか」 and 「なんて」 specifically gained the emotional coloring
  to convey contempt or disbelief.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「なんか・なんて」 is used to express subjective feelings such as dismissiveness, contempt, or strong surprise and disbelief towards something. These are colloquial variants, primarily used in spoken Japanese, and they add a strong emotional tone to the statement.

  **なんか (nanka)**: This variant often carries a nuance of slight contempt, dismissal, or downplaying. It suggests that the speaker considers the preceding item or concept to be of little importance, value, or relevance. For instance, if someone says 「ゲームなんか嫌いだよ」, it doesn't just mean 'I dislike games', but rather implies 'I dislike trivial things like games' or 'I disdain games'. It treats the item or concept as unworthy of serious consideration.

  **なんて (nante)**: This variant is used to express strong surprise, disbelief, or contempt regarding the preceding noun, action, or statement. It often functions rhetorically, conveying the speaker's strong emotional reaction, as if saying "How could such a thing be!" or "I can't believe something like that!" For example, 「嘘なんて言わないで！」 (Don't say such a lie!) expresses strong disbelief or objection to the notion of lying. It highlights an unexpected, outrageous, or contemptible quality of the preceding item or action. 「なんて」 can also appear after a quote or thought (e.g., 「〜なんて言う」), conveying the speaker's negative or dismissive reaction to the quoted content.
false_friends:
  - term: とか (hearsay)
    meaning: Listing examples casually; expressing uncertainty or hearsay; 'things like... or something.'
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とか」 is similar to 「なんか」「なんて」 in its casual listing function. However, 「とか」 can also indicate
      hearsay or uncertainty, which 「なんか」「なんて」 do not typically convey. It's also more strictly for *listing*
      examples, while 「なんか/なんて」 are primarily used to express subjective feelings like contempt or surprise.
    grammar_point: とか (hearsay)
  - term: ばかり (only・excessive)
    meaning: Only, just, nothing but; indicates an excessive amount or focus on one thing.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「ばかり」 can mean 'just' or 'only,' its primary function is to emphasize exclusivity or
      excess. In contrast, 「なんか」 and 「なんて」 are used to express subjective emotional reactions like dismissiveness,
      contempt, or surprise, sometimes implying 'such a trivial thing.'
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・just, often with nuance of excess)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「なんか・なんて」 and similar expressions like 「とか」 or
  「ばかり」, consider the speaker's emotional intent. While 「とか」 can also be casual, its primary function
  can be to indicate hearsay or uncertainty, unlike 「なんか・なんて」 which primarily convey subjective feelings
  of contempt, dismissiveness, or surprise. 「ばかり」 emphasizes exclusivity or excess. Note that the more
  neutral and formal counterpart for listing is 「など」, which does not carry these strong emotional connotations.
