    "etymology": "「といった」 comes from 「と」 (a particle indicating content or quotation) and the past tense of the verb 「言う」 (iu, to say). It literally means \"something that can be said as...\" and is used to introduce examples or things that fall under a certain category.",
    "writeup": "「といった」 functions similarly to 「などの」 or 「のような」, providing examples. It is formed from the quotative particle 「と」 and the past tense of the verb 「言う」 (to say). Its literal interpretation can be understood as \"that can be said as...\", serving to introduce representative examples within a broader category.\n\nThis grammar point can be used in two primary patterns:\n\n*   **Noun + といった + Noun**: This pattern is used to list specific items that belong to a general category. For instance, 「犬、猫 といった ペット」 (pets such as dogs and cats) specifies typical examples within the category of \"pets.\"\n*   **Sentence + といった + Noun**: This pattern allows for describing characteristics, concepts, or problems by presenting a sentence or phrase as an example of that characteristic. For example, 「持ち運びしやすい、容量が大きい といった 特徴」 (characteristics such as being easy to carry and having a large capacity) uses descriptive phrases as examples of \"characteristics.\"\n\nIt is often combined with other listing particles like 「や」 or 「とか」 when multiple examples are being provided, as in 「洗濯や料理 といった 家事」 (household chores such as laundry and cooking).\n\nAdditionally, 「といった」 can be used in the fixed expression 「これといった」, which typically appears with a negative verb, meaning \"any particular\" or \"any specific.\" For example, 「これといった理由もない」 means \"without any particular reason.\"",
