    "etymology": "The grammar point 「といった」 is derived from 「と」 (a particle indicating content or quotation) and 「言った」 (the past tense of the verb 「言う」, meaning \"to say\"). Literally, it means \"said as\" or \"like (something) that was said.\"",
    "writeup": "「といった」 is a versatile expression used to introduce examples, similar to 「などの」 or 「のような」. It stems from 「と」 and the past tense of the verb 「言う」 (to say), and is often translated as \"such as\" or \"like\". It is followed by a noun that represents the general category to which the examples belong. Constructions like 「や」 and 「とか」 can be used if multiple examples are given. This grammar point can be used to list nouns or actions.",
