    "etymology": "「といった」 comes from 「と」 (a particle indicating content or quotation) and the past tense of the verb 「言う」 (iu, to say). It literally means \"something that can be said as...\" and is used to introduce examples or things that fall under a certain category.",
    "writeup": "「といった」 is used to give examples, similar to 「などの」 or 「のような」. Derived from 「と」 and the past tense of the verb 「言う」, it translates to \"(B) such as (A)\" or \"(B) like (A)\". It's followed by a noun that represents the broader category to which the examples belong, with the literal meaning being something like \"(B) that can be called (A)\". 「といった」 is used with nouns in both (A) and (B). Constructions like 「や」 and 「とか」 can be used when there are multiple examples (B) that fit into category (A).",
