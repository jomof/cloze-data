        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "to express contingency or variability of outcome based on method",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes that the outcome or interpretation is highly dependent on the specific manner, method, or perspective. Often highlights significant differences in results.",
        "counterpoint": "Often contrasted with simply using 「〜方 (かた)」. While 「〜方」 refers to a general 'way of doing something', 「ようによっては」 specifically points to the *manner* of execution affecting the result, implying a range of possible outcomes."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「様 (yō)」, meaning 'way' or 'manner,' combined with 「に (ni)」 (case-marking particle), the te-form of the verb 「よる (yoru)」 meaning 'to depend on', and the adverbial particle 「は (wa)」. The phrase literally translates to 'depending on the way that', underscoring the conditional nature of the outcome based on the approach taken.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **ようによっては** indicates that the outcome of a situation is contingent on the method or manner in which something is done. It implies that different approaches can lead to significantly different results. This phrase is constructed from the noun **様** (yō), meaning 'manner' or 'way', followed by the case-marking particle **に**, the **て-form** of the verb **よる** ('to depend on', 'to be due to'), and the adverbial particle **は**. It is often used to highlight variations in results based on individual perspectives or different methods.\n\n**ようによっては** can be considered a more advanced and formal version of the suffix **方**, which also emphasizes a 'way' of doing something. While often interchangeable, **様** generally lends a more formal tone, making it suitable for more formal or reflective contexts.",
