        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "to express contingency or variability of outcome based on method or perception",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes that the outcome or interpretation is highly dependent on the specific manner, method, or perspective. Often highlights significant differences in results, implying that a slight change in approach can lead to a drastically different conclusion.",
        "counterpoint": "Often contrasted with simply using 「〜方 (かた)」. While 「〜方」 refers to a general 'way of doing something', 「ようによっては」 specifically points to the *manner* of execution affecting the result, implying a range of possible outcomes. It also differs from 「〜次第 (しだい)」 which implies a direct dependency on a specific condition."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ようによっては」 is derived from 「様 (yō)」, meaning 'manner' or 'way,' combined with the case-marking particle 「に (ni)」, the te-form of the verb 「よる (yoru)」 meaning 'to depend on' or 'to be due to,' and the adverbial particle 「は (wa)」. Historically, 「様」 has been used to denote various states or conditions. Its combination with 「よる」 and 「は」 evolved to articulate how outcomes are contingent upon the specific approach or perspective taken. This construction highlights the direct causal link between *how* something is done or perceived and the resulting consequence, embodying the concept of 'consequence originating from a particular manner'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **ようによっては** indicates that the outcome of a situation or the interpretation of something is contingent on the method or manner in which it is done or perceived. It implies that different approaches can lead to significantly different results, highlighting the variability of outcomes based on one's specific actions or perspective.\n\nThis phrase is constructed by attaching to the **ます-stem** (or 連用形 - ren'youkei) of a verb. For example, from the verb `見る (miru)`, the ます-stem is `見 (mi)`, so it becomes `見ようによっては (mi-yō ni yotte wa)`. Similarly, `する (suru)` becomes `し (shi)` as in `しようによっては (shi-yō ni yotte wa)`.\n\n**ようによっては** is typically used in formal or semi-formal contexts. It conveys a nuance of critical observation, where the specific details of 'how' something is handled or interpreted are crucial. While often interchangeable with the more general suffix **〜方 (かた)** (e.g., `見方` vs. `見よう`), **ようによっては** tends to emphasize the *contingency* and *potential for varying results* more strongly, often suggesting a wide spectrum of possibilities that depend on a particular approach. It prompts consideration of alternative perspectives or methods that might lead to different conclusions.",

            "meaning": "way, method, how to do something",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both 「ようによっては」 and 「〜方」 can express 'depending on the way', 「〜方」 is a more general suffix indicating 'the method of doing something' (e.g., 使い方 - how to use, 読み方 - how to read). It describes the general technique or procedure without necessarily emphasizing the strong contingency of results based on *nuanced execution*, which is a key aspect of 「ようによっては」."

            "nuance": "「〜次第」 signifies a direct dependency on a specific condition or event, or a consequence that immediately follows a condition (e.g., 結果次第 - depending on the results, 天気次第 - depending on the weather). Unlike 「ようによっては」, it focuses on external conditions or decisive factors rather than the *manner* or *approach* of an action being the variable influencing the outcome. 「ようによっては」 specifically emphasizes the subjective 'how' that can lead to diverse results."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「ようによっては」 places strong emphasis on the *manner* or *specific approach* taken, highlighting how different methods can lead to vastly different outcomes. In contrast, 「〜方」 refers to a general 'way of doing something' without the same emphasis on contingency, and 「〜次第」 points to a direct dependency on a specific condition or event. If the nuance is about *how* something is executed or perceived, use 「ようによっては」. If it's simply a 'way' or a direct 'dependency', consider 「〜方」 or 「〜次第」 respectively.",
