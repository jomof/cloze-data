    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「様 (yō)」, meaning 'way' or 'manner,' combined with 「に (ni)」 (case marking particle), the te-form of the verb 「よる (yoru)」 meaning 'to depend on', and the adverbial particle 「は (wa)」. The phrase literally translates to 'depending on the way that'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **ようによっては** indicates that the outcome of a situation is contingent on the method or manner in which something is done. It implies that different approaches can lead to significantly different results. This phrase is constructed from the noun **様** (yō), meaning 'manner' or 'way', followed by the case-marking particle **に**, the **て-form** of the verb **よる** ('to depend on', 'to be due to'), and the adverbial particle **は**. It is often used to highlight variations in results based on individual perspectives or different methods.\n\n**ようによっては** can be considered a more advanced and formal version of the suffix **方**, which also emphasizes a 'way' of doing something. While often interchangeable, **様** generally lends a more formal tone.",
