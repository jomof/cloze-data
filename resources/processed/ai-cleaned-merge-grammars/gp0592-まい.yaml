    "etymology": "まい originates from the combination of the auxiliary verb 「む」, expressing intention or presumption, and the negative auxiliary 「ない」. Over time, 「むない」 contracted to 「まい」, retaining the sense of negative intention or weak presumption.",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb 「まい」 expresses negative volition or conjecture, akin to a more formal 「〜ないだろう」. It suggests a strong intention not to do something or a belief that something is unlikely to happen. It's considered slightly formal and is more often found in writing or formal speech.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   When attached to 「する」 or 「来る」, variations like 「しまい」, 「すまい」, 「きまい」, and 「こまい」 are also used, although 「するまい」 and 「来るまい」 remain common.",
