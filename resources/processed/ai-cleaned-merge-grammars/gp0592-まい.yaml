    "etymology": "「まい」 originates from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「む」, which expresses intention, presumption, or suitability. 「む」 evolved into 「う」/「よう」 for positive volition, and 「まい」 for negative volition. It carries a nuance of determination or strong negation.",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb 「まい」 in Japanese expresses **negative volition** or **conjecture**. It's essentially the opposite of 「う」 and 「よう」, which denote positive volition. 「まい」 connects to the base form (dictionary form) of verbs and is considered somewhat formal. It can be translated as \"won't (do),\" \"intend not to (do),\" or \"probably not (will do).\" Think of it as a condensed way of saying 「〜ないだろう」. \n\nWhen used with 「する」 or 「来る」, you'll often see it connected to the conjunctive form as 「しまい」, 「すまい」, 「きまい」, and 「こまい」. However, the standard 「するまい」 and 「来るまい」 are also common. The 「まじ」 form is the past form and is considered archaic or literary.",

    "post_example_writeup": "When 「まい」 combines with 「する」 or 「来る」, it commonly contracts to forms like 「しまい」, 「すまい」, 「きまい」, and 「こまい」. These contractions are considered colloquial and are frequently heard in everyday conversation. For instance, instead of saying 「するまい」, you might hear 「しまい」. While the standard 「するまい」 and 「来るまい」 are also acceptable, knowing these contracted forms will enhance your comprehension of spoken Japanese.",
