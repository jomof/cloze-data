It suggests a strong intention not to do something or a belief that something is unlikely to happen. It's considered slightly formal and is more often found in writing or formal speech.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   When attached to 「する」 or 「来る」, variations like 「しまい」, 「すまい」, 「きまい」, and 「こまい」 are also used, although 「するまい」 and 「来るまい」 remain common.",
