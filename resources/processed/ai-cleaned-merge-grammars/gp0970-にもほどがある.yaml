    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「にもほどがある」 is composed of 「に」 (case-marking particle), 「も」 (adverbial particle), 「程(ほど)」 (noun meaning 'bounds' or 'limit'), and 「がある」 (to have). The literal meaning is 'there are bounds even within (A)', which conveys the critical nuance of the more standard translations.",
    "writeup": "「にもほどがある」 is an expression often used critically to state that something is **too much**, based on the speaker's personal opinion. Common translations include \"there is a limit to (A),\" \"you are too (A),\" or \"how (A) can one be!\" Because it includes the noun 「程(ほど)」 meaning \"limit,\" it implies that something has exceeded a reasonable boundary. While primarily used negatively, it can be used jokingly with positive adjectives like 「かわいい」 (\"cute\") or 「うまい」 (\"delicious\") to express extreme admiration or approval. This expression is versatile and can be applied to actions, states, or characteristics that the speaker deems to have crossed an acceptable line.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「～すぎる」 simply describes an action or state as being excessive, 「にもほどがある」 implies that the excess has crossed a boundary or become inappropriate, often with a critical or exasperated nuance. For example, 「食べすぎる」 means 'to eat too much,' but 「食べ過ぎにもほどがある」 implies that eating that much is unreasonably gluttonous.",
