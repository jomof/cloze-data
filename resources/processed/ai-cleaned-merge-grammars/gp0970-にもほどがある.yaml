        "[Word or phrase] + にもほどがある": "Indicates that something is excessive or beyond reasonable limits. This can apply to actions, qualities, or situations that are deemed to have crossed an acceptable boundary, often eliciting a critical, exasperated, or, in some cases, humorously admiring response from the speaker. The phrase marks the point at which an excessive state or action becomes inappropriate or noteworthy due to its extreme nature, suggesting that there's a point beyond which even that thing becomes unacceptable or remarkable. For instance, 「親切にもほどがある」 (There's a limit to kindness) implies that the kindness is so excessive it's become problematic or overwhelming. It attaches to nouns or the plain forms of verbs/adjectives that describe the excessive quality or action being commented upon, often followed by a copula if the preceding word is a noun or な-adjective (e.g., 「楽観的であるにもほどがある」 or 「楽観的なのにもほどがある」)."

        "nuance": "Carries a critical or exasperated tone, implying that the excess is inappropriate or unreasonable, though it can be used humorously for positive exaggeration. It suggests that a boundary has been crossed, beyond which the quality or action becomes noteworthy or problematic. This nuance differentiates it from simpler expressions of excess, as it implies a judgment of acceptability or a strong emotional reaction to the degree of excess. While it can be used politely, the underlying sentiment often reflects mild to strong disapproval or disbelief at the extent of something. The inclusion of 「も」 adds emphasis, reinforcing that 'even X' (where X is the noun/concept in question) has its limits.",
        "colocation": "Often collocates with qualities that can be excessive, such as 丁寧 (politeness), 迷惑 (nuisance), 楽観的 (optimism), 厳し (strictness), ずぼら (sloppiness), 天才 (genius), 優しい (kindness), 愚か (foolishness), 図々しい (impudence)."
    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「にもほどがある」 is composed of 「に」 (case-marking particle), 「も」 (adverbial particle), 「程(ほど)」 (noun meaning 'bounds' or 'limit'), and 「がある」 (to have). The literal meaning is 'there are bounds even within (A)', which conveys the critical nuance of the more standard translations. Historically, 程 (ほど) has long been used to denote a reasonable degree or measure. The combination with 「も」 emphasizes that even for the specified quality or action, there exists a limit, and that limit has been surpassed. This structure highlights a perceived violation of expected norms or boundaries, leading to the sense of ",
    "writeup": "「にもほどがある」 is an expression used to convey that something is excessively so, to the point of being unreasonable or inappropriate. It literally means \"even for (this thing), there is a limit.\" This phrase is often used to criticize or express exasperation when an action, characteristic, or situation goes beyond what is considered acceptable or normal. It implies that a boundary has been crossed.\n\nWhile most commonly used with negative connotations (e.g., criticizing someone's laziness or strictness), it can also be employed humorously or to express extreme admiration for positive qualities. In such cases, it suggests that the positive attribute is so outstanding it almost defies belief or expectation. For example, you might hear it used about something incredibly delicious or a truly exceptional talent.\n\nIt is a versatile expression that can be attached to nouns (e.g., 「親切さにもほどがある」 - \"There's a limit to kindness\"), or to the plain form of verbs and adjectives, often by nominalizing them first (e.g., 「楽観的なのにもほどがある」 - \"There's a limit to being optimistic\"). The phrasing reflects the speaker's personal judgment that the degree of something has become too much.",
