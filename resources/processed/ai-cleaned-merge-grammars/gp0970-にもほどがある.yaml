    "writeup": "にも程がある is an expression often used critically to state that something is too much, based on the speaker's personal opinion. Common translations include \"How (A) can one be...\", \"There is a limit to (A)\", or \"You are too (A)\".\n\nIt's composed of the case-marking particle に, the adverbial particle も, the noun 程 \"bounds,\" and がある \"to have.\" The more literal meaning, \"There are bounds even within (A),\" carries the critical nuance of the standard translations.\n\nThis structure may follow almost any word type in its standard form.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nDespite being used negatively in most situations, there are instances where にも程がある will be used positively with adjectives such as かわいい \"cute\" or うまい \"delicious.\" In sentences like this, the grammar structure is being used jokingly to express admiration or approval.",
    "etymology": "The expression derives from the idea that everything has a limit (程 - *hodo*) or boundary. The addition of に and も emphasizes that even within a certain category, there is still a reasonable limit that should not be exceeded. がある (*ga aru*) simply indicates the existence of this limit.",
