    "etymology": "The expression 「にもほどがある」 is composed of 「に」 (case-marking particle), 「も」 (adverbial particle), 「程(ほど)」 (noun meaning 'bounds' or 'limit'), and 「がある」 (to have). The literal meaning is 'there are bounds even within (A)', which conveys the critical nuance of the more standard translations.",
    "writeup": "「にもほどがある」 is an expression often used critically to state that something is **too much**, based on the speaker's personal opinion. Common translations include \"there is a limit to (A),\" \"you are too (A),\" or \"how (A) can one be!\" Because it includes the noun 「程(ほど)」 meaning \"limit,\" it implies that something has exceeded a reasonable boundary. While primarily used negatively, it can be used jokingly with positive adjectives like 「かわいい」 (\"cute\") or 「うまい」 (\"delicious\") to express admiration or approval.",
