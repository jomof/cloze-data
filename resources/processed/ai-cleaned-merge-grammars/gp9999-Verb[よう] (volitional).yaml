details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  function: Expresses the speaker's intention (singular or plural), or invites/suggests an action to others.
    Can also express strong will or determination.
  nuance: Can be a direct invitation, a self-reflection of intent, or a resolution. The plain 「よう」 is
    casual, sometimes sounding like talking to oneself or a very direct suggestion to close friends. The
    polite 「ましょう」 is common for polite invitations.
  grammatical-role: Forms the predicate of a sentence, indicating the speaker's will or suggestion.
etymology: The volitional form, particularly the 「よう」 ending, has roots in classical Japanese. It evolved
  from older forms like 「む」 (mu) and 「う」 (u), which expressed similar concepts of intention or conjecture.
  Over time, these forms merged and standardized into 「よう」 for modern Japanese. This evolution reflects
  a shared linguistic ancestry with the conjectural 「だろう」 (darou) and 「でしょう」 (deshou), implying a "guess"
  or "likely outcome" that, when applied to one's own actions, becomes an intention.
writeup: |-
  The Japanese volitional form, ending in 「よう」 for plain form verbs and 「ましょう」 for polite form verbs, is used to express the speaker's intention or to make a suggestion. It is a fundamental conjugation in Japanese, indicating a proactive stance from the speaker.

  **Uses of the Volitional Form:**

  1.  **Expressing Speaker's Intention (I intend to... / Let's...)**:
      *   When the speaker is expressing their own intention to do something, often to themselves or as a firm decision.
      *   Example: 「よし、頑張ろう。」 (Alright, I'll do my best / Let's do our best.)
      *   When used with 「と思う」 (to think), it softens the direct intention into "I think I'll do..." or "I'm thinking of doing...". This is a very common way to express personal plans without sounding too assertive.

  2.  **Making a Suggestion or Invitation (Shall we...? / Let's...)**:
      *   When the speaker proposes an action to others.
      *   Example: 「映画に行こうか。」 (Shall we go to the movies?) or 「みんなで食べましょう。」 (Let's eat together, everyone.)
      *   This is particularly common with 「ましょう」 in polite contexts.

  **Plain Form (〜よう)**
  The plain volitional form 「〜よう」 is used in casual conversations among friends, family, or when talking to oneself. It can sound very direct as a suggestion or resolute as an intention.

  **Polite Form (〜ましょう)**
  The polite volitional form 「〜ましょう」 is widely used in formal or semi-formal settings, with strangers, superiors, or in public announcements. It is the most common way to invite someone or suggest an activity politely.

  **Important Considerations**:
  *   The volitional form focuses on the *speaker's* will or suggestion.
  *   When asking a question with 「〜ようか？」 or 「〜ましょうか？」, it becomes an invitation or an offer ("Shall I/we...?").
  *   While 「〜よう」 primarily conveys intention or suggestion, its underlying root in conjecture means it can sometimes hint at a "likely outcome" if one acts.
false_friends:
  - term: ましょう (polite volitional or suggestion)
    meaning: Let's (politely), Shall we (politely)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ましょう」 is the polite counterpart of 「よう」. While 「よう」 is casual and often used among close
      friends or when talking to oneself, 「ましょう」 is suitable for broader polite contexts, including addressing
      strangers or superiors.
    grammar_point: ましょう (polite volitional or suggestion)
  - term: たい (want to do)
    meaning: want to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '「〜たい」 expresses a **desire** (what one *wants* to do), whereas 「〜よう」 expresses an **intention**
      (what one *plans* or *decides* to do) or a **suggestion**. The difference is subtle but important:
      desire is a feeling, intention is a decision.'
    grammar_point: たい (want to do)
  - term: つもりだ (to intend to)
    meaning: intend to, plan to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜つもりだ」 expresses a **firm plan or intention**, often decided in advance. 「〜よう」 can express
      a more immediate decision, a casual suggestion, or a general intention. While both relate to intention,
      「つもりだ」 implies a stronger, more definite commitment.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]つもりだ (to intend to)'
  - term: ことにする (to decide to do)
    meaning: to decide to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ことにする」 explicitly states that a **decision has been made**. 「〜よう」 expresses the intention
      itself, which might be a decision, but it doesn't necessarily emphasize the act of deciding as much
      as 「〜ことにする」 does. 「ことにする」 often implies a resolution after consideration.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ことにする (to decide to do)'
  - term: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
    meaning: probably, I suppose, it seems
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Although 「だろう」 shares a historical root with 「よう」, their modern usages are distinct. 「だろう・でしょう」
      expresses **conjecture or probability** ("it probably is," "it will likely be"). In contrast, 「〜よう」
      expresses the speaker's **intention or suggestion**. Be careful not to confuse them, especially
      since verbs ending in 「う」 can also sometimes function as conjecture.
    grammar_point: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
post_false_friends_writeup: It's essential to distinguish the volitional form from other expressions that
  convey desire, firm plans, or conjecture. While 「ましょう」 is simply the polite version of 「よう」, phrases
  like 「〜たい」 express personal desire rather than an intention or suggestion. 「〜つもりだ」 and 「〜ことにする」 convey
  more definite plans or decisions, with 「つもりだ」 being a firm intention and 「ことにする」 emphasizing the act
  of deciding. Finally, 「〜だろう・でしょう」, despite its similar ending to the plain volitional for Godan verbs,
  is used for probability or conjecture, not for expressing the speaker's will. Understanding these differences
  is key to accurately conveying your meaning in Japanese.
