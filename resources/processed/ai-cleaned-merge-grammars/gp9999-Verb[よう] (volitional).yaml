jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  function: To express the speaker's intention, a suggestion, or an invitation.
  nuance: The volitional form is versatile, conveying a range from a firm decision to a soft suggestion,
    heavily influenced by context, intonation, and accompanying particles (though it's the plain form,
    so no particles like か or ね are inherent to it). It's commonly used when addressing oneself, a close
    friend, or an in-group member.
  grammatical-role: Verb conjugation expressing volition
etymology: The Japanese volitional form, ending in 「よう」 for most verbs, evolved from older classical Japanese
  forms. Originally, verbs often conjugated with endings like 「む」 (mú) or 「う」 (ú) to express intention
  or desire. Over centuries, these endings phonetically shifted and merged into the modern 「よう」. For instance,
  五段動詞 (Group 1 verbs) historically changed their final syllable's vowel sound and added 「う」 (e.g., nom-u
  + umu → nom-o-u). 一段動詞 (Group 2 verbs) and irregular verbs developed their patterns through similar
  linguistic processes, leading to the uniform and ubiquitous modern volitional forms. This evolution
  reflects a drive for phonological simplicity and grammatical consistency in expressing a speaker's will
  or proposition.
writeup: |-
  The plain volitional form, ending in 「よう」, is a fundamental verb conjugation in Japanese that primarily expresses two key meanings: **suggestion or invitation** and the **speaker's intention or decision**. It's considered a plain form, meaning it's typically used in casual speech among friends, family, or people of equal or lower status.

  When used as a **suggestion or invitation**, it translates to 'Let's do X' or 'Shall we do X?'. This usage often implies a shared action or a proposal to someone else. It's less formal than its polite counterpart, 「ましょう」, and is commonly heard in everyday conversations. The emphasis is on proposing an action to be done together or by the listener, as a casual prompt.

  When expressing the **speaker's intention or decision**, it translates to 'I intend to do X' or 'I will do X'. In this context, the volitional form reflects a personal resolve or a decision made by the speaker. This can be used when talking to oneself, making a firm commitment, or simply stating one's plan. It's often followed by phrases like 「と思う」 (to think/intend) to make the intention more explicit, but even alone, the volitional form can convey this meaning, especially with appropriate intonation. It's a direct way for the speaker to assert their will or future action.
false_friends:
  - term: ましょう (polite volitional or suggestion)
    meaning: Let's do・shall we・I intend to do (polite)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「よう」 is the plain volitional form, 「ましょう」 is its polite equivalent. Both express suggestion
      or intention, but 「ましょう」 is used in formal settings or when addressing someone you want to show
      respect to.
    grammar_point: ましょう (polite volitional or suggestion)
  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]+ようと思う (intend to)
    meaning: I intend to do X
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The simple 「よう」 form can imply intention, but adding 「と思う」 makes the intention more explicit
      and less ambiguous, especially if the context might otherwise suggest a mere suggestion. 「ようと思う」
      emphasizes the speaker's thought process or decision.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-よう]思う (intend to)'
  - term: Verb[たい] (desiderative)
    meaning: Want to do X
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The 「たい」 form expresses the speaker's desire or wish to do something, focusing on the feeling
      of wanting. In contrast, 「よう」 expresses the speaker's intention or a direct proposal to act. One
      is a wish, the other is a resolve or suggestion.
    grammar_point: Verb[たい] (desiderative)
post_false_friends_writeup: When differentiating between 「よう」, 「ましょう」, and 「たい」, remember that 「よう」 is
  the casual, plain form for 'let's' or 'I intend'. 「ましょう」 conveys the same meaning but with politeness.
  「たい」, however, expresses 'want to'—a personal desire rather than a proposed action or firm intention.
  Pay attention to the level of formality and whether the speaker is expressing a desire, a direct intention,
  or proposing an action.
