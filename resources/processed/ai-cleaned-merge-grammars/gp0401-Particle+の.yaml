        "usage-context": "Commonly used in various situations to link nouns. The specific register depends on the context of the larger sentence.",
        "function": "To link a noun (B) to a preceding phrase (Noun A + particle), specifying a relationship or characteristic of Noun B.",
        "nuance": "This construction transforms a particle-marked noun phrase into an attributive clause, allowing it to directly modify a subsequent noun. It implies that the modifying phrase fully describes or categorizes the following noun.",
        "source": "JLPT N3 Grammar",
        "grammatical-role": "Acts as an adjectival phrase modifying the following noun."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle の itself is believed to have originated from the possessive particle 'tsu' (つ) in Old Japanese. Over time, 'tsu' (つ) evolved into 'no' and broadened its function to indicate various relationships between nouns, not just possession. Its current usage in 'Particle+の' builds upon this modificational role, extending the scope of what can act as a noun modifier from simple possession to more complex relationships defined by other particles.",
    "writeup": "The particle の is frequently combined with other particles to create more nuanced expressions. Its primary function in this construction is to link noun (B) to a preceding noun (A) modified by another particle, where noun (B) is described or qualified by the phrase consisting of noun (A) and the preceding particle. This effectively turns the preceding particle + noun (A) into an adjectival phrase modifying noun (B). Some common combinations include:\n\n*   **Noun (A) から の Noun (B)**: This means 'B that is from A', indicating the origin or source of B.\n*   **Noun (A) と の Noun (B)**: This means 'B that is with A', indicating a relationship, association, or companionship with A.\n*   **Noun (A) へ の Noun (B)**: This means 'B that is towards A' or 'B for A', indicating direction, destination, or recipient.\n*   **Noun (A) で の Noun (B)**: This means 'B that is done at A' or 'B using A', indicating the location, method, or context of B.\n*   **Noun (A) まで の Noun (B)**: This means 'B that is until A', indicating a limit, duration, or extent up to A.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\nBecause noun (A) is describing noun (B), noun (B) functions as the main subject of the overall phrase. Due to this, particles like に, も, は, が, and を, which typically mark subjects, topics, or objects of actions, cannot be directly followed by の in this specific linking construction. This is because the preceding particle (から, と, へ, で, まで) already defines the relationship of noun (A) to the noun (B) that follows の. For example, you would not say 「日本がの車」 or 「東京をの観光」. The structure fundamentally shifts the role of the particle-marked noun phrase to be descriptive of the subsequent noun.",

            "kind": "similar expression",

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "It is crucial to distinguish this usage from other functions of の. When 'Particle+の' is used, の always follows another particle (like から, と, へ, で, or まで), serving to modify the subsequent noun based on the relationship established by that preceding particle. In contrast, の used for possession directly links two nouns, indicating ownership or association (e.g., 「私の本」, 'my book'), while の used for nominalization replaces a noun following an adjective (e.g., 「大きいのは」, 'the big one'). The key differentiator is the presence of another particle immediately preceding の in this specific grammatical pattern.",
