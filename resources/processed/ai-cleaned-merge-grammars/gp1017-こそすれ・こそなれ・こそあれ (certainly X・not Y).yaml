  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Formal, typically used in written language or serious discussions.
etymology: The adverbial particle 「こそ」 is used for emphasis. It is followed by the realis (未然形 + ば/已然形)
  forms of the verbs 「する」 (to do), 「なる」 (to become), and 「ある」 (to be), which become 「こそすれ」, 「こそなれ」, and
  「こそあれ」 respectively. These forms, while originating from classical Japanese verb conjugations, are used
  in modern Japanese specifically within this emphatic structure to highlight the preceding statement
  while strongly negating the following one.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「こそすれ〜ない」 is a sophisticated expression used to convey strong emphasis, asserting that while one thing is true or will happen, a specific contrasting or negative outcome certainly will not. It is predominantly used in formal contexts, including written Japanese, academic discourse, or serious conversations.

  This pattern leverages the classical Japanese realis forms of certain verbs combined with the emphatic particle 「こそ」. The verbs involved are typically:

  *   **する (to do) → こそすれ**
  *   **なる (to become) → こそなれ**
  *   **ある (to be) → こそあれ**

  **Usage Notes:**

  *   **こそすれ**: This form can attach to the noun component of a する-verb (e.g., 勉強こそすれ) or the conjunctive form (連用形) of standard verbs (e.g., 食べこそすれ, though this specific usage is less common in this exact pattern, and often refers to the noun part of the verb phrase). It is commonly used when discussing actions or phenomena.
  *   **こそなれ**: Used when the preceding element is a noun or an adjective, indicating a state or condition. It emphasizes that something will develop into a positive state, but not a negative one.
  *   **こそあれ**: Primarily used with nouns, it acknowledges the existence of one quality or state while denying the presence of an associated negative one.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *   The phrase following 「こそすれ」, 「こそなれ」, or 「こそあれ」 will always contain a negative statement (indicated by 「〜ない」 or similar negation). This negation is what the speaker is often correcting or strongly denying as a misconception.
  *   Pay close attention to the verb stem in sentences, as auxiliary verbs like causative (〜させる) or passive (〜られる) can precede the 「こそする」 form. For example, 「感謝されこそすれ」 (to be thanked, certainly not...). You must discern the base verb and its modification.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜ても〜ない
    meaning: Even if/though X, Y will not happen.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expresses a concession, meaning that even if the condition is met, the outcome won't
      follow. It lacks the strong, almost corrective emphasis of 「こそすれ〜ない」, which often implies that something
      *certainly* will not happen, contrary to a potential misconception.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: 〜ばかりで〜ない
    meaning: Only X (happens), but Y (does not happen).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This structure emphasizes that only one thing is happening, implying another isn't. While
      it conveys a sense of 'only' or 'just,' 「こそすれ〜ない」 carries a stronger sense of 'certainly not' or
      'absolutely not' in its negation, often used to directly refute a mistaken idea.
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・excessive)
  - term: 〜どころか
    meaning: Far from it; on the contrary; let alone.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜どころか」 expresses a strong contradiction or an unexpected degree, often implying 'not
      just X, but even Y (or the opposite of X)', 「こそすれ〜ない」 focuses on *emphatically asserting* that something
      *will certainly not happen* while acknowledging a related, often opposite, action or state *will*
      happen. The emphasis of 「こそすれ〜ない」 is on denying a specific negative outcome with certainty, rather
      than just contradicting an expectation.
    grammar_point: どころか (far from)
  - term: まじき (unbecoming of)
    meaning: Unbecoming of, Unworthy of, Not proper for, Should not, Must not, Cannot
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 「こそすれ〜ない」 and 「〜まじき」 express a strong negation of an expected or proper outcome. However,
      「こそすれ〜ない」 asserts that one action *will* occur while another *certainly will not*, often correcting
      a misconception. 「〜まじき」 on the other hand, describes an action or quality as inherently unsuitable
      or unworthy for a given person or situation, implying a moral or social judgment rather than a factual
      impossibility.
    grammar_point: まじき (unbecoming of)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「〜ても〜ない」 and 「〜ばかりで〜ない」 can also express a contrast or a lack of something,
  they do not carry the same degree of emphatic assertion as 「こそすれ〜ない」. The latter explicitly states that
  the negated outcome will *certainly not* occur, often in response to an implied misunderstanding or
  expectation. When using 「こそすれ〜ない」, the speaker is making a definitive statement about what *is* true
  versus what is *not* true, emphasizing the certainty of the former and the absolute impossibility of
  the latter. 「〜どころか」 is used to state that something is far from the case, often implying an even stronger
  opposite, whereas 「こそすれ〜ない」 more directly presents one action/state as certain while negating another.

    japanese:
      - この 計画 は 変更 {こそ すれ}、中止 は し ない だろう。
      - この 計画 は 変更 {こそ すれ}、中止 は ない でしょう。
      - この 計画 は 変更 {こそ すれ}、中止 は 絶対 に あり ませ ん。

          - 変更 する だろう が、中止 は し ない だろう
        english: It will probably change, but it won't be cancelled.
        hint: This uses a simple conjunction 'but,' which is less emphatic. We're looking for a stronger,
          more formal assertion.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 変更 は する だろう が、中止 は し ない だろう
        english: As for changing, it will probably change, but it won't be cancelled.
        hint: While 「は」 marks emphasis, it doesn't carry the same strong, almost corrective, assertion
          of 'certainly X, but certainly not Y' that 「こそすれ」 does. We're looking for a definitive denial
          against an implied misconception.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 計画 は 変更 し て も、中止 は し ない だろう。
        english: Even if this plan is changed, it won't be cancelled.
        hint: This suggests a concession ('even if X'), while the original emphasizes that change is the
          only outcome, and cancellation definitely won't happen. We're looking for certainty of action,
          not concession.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 計画 は 変更 ばかり で、中止 は し ない だろう。
        english: This plan is only changed, and won't be cancelled.
        hint: This implies only changing, but lacks the strong assertion that cancellation definitely
          won't happen. We're looking for strong denial of an outcome.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 計画 は 中止 する どころ か、変更 する だろう。
        english: Far from cancelling this plan, it will probably be changed.
        hint: This focuses on the opposite of cancelling. The original emphasizes that changing *is* the
          action, and cancelling *is not* the action. We're looking for 'X but certainly not Y'.
    scene: A project manager addresses a team, affirming continuity despite necessary adaptations.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「だろう」 in the first Japanese variation indicates a confident prediction, often with
      a slightly more masculine or informal leaning, suitable for a project manager asserting policy.
      The phrase 「変更こそすれ」 (certainly will change) is a formal assertion, common in managerial discourse,
      emphasizing that change is the only outcome, not cancellation.
  - english: Effort will certainly lead to success, and never end in failure.
    japanese:

        english: Effort will probably lead to success, but it won't end in failure.
        hint: The motivational context of a coach's speech requires a stronger, more direct and inspiring
          assertion than a mere conjectural statement with 「〜だろうが」.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 努力 すれ ば 成功 に なる だろう が、失敗 に 終わる こと は ない。
        english: If you make an effort, it will probably lead to success, but it won't end in failure.
        hint: While 「〜すれば」 suggests a condition, the coach's intent is to emphasize the *inevitability*
          of success with effort, which 「こそなれ」 conveys more powerfully than a conditional clause.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 努力 は 成功 に なっ て も、失敗 に 終わる こと は ない。
        english: Even if effort leads to success, it won't end in failure.
        hint: This sounds contradictory, implying success but also implying failure is possible. The original
          emphasizes that effort *becomes* success and *never* failure. We're looking for a definitive
          positive transformation and negation of a negative one.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 努力 は 成功 ばかり で、失敗 に 終わる こと は ない。
        english: Effort is only success, and won't end in failure.
        hint: This suggests effort *is* success, but doesn't quite capture the transformative 'becomes'
          aspect. We're looking for 'X will certainly become Y, but not Z'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 努力 は 失敗 に 終わる どころ か、成功 に なる。
        english: Far from effort ending in failure, it will become success.
        hint: This emphasizes the opposition to failure. The original highlights the *certainty* of becoming
          success, and *never* failing. We're looking for the transformation aspect and definite negation.
    scene: A coach gives a motivational speech to their athletes, aiming to instill confidence.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: inspirational
    nuance: 「努力は 成功に こそなれ」 is a powerful, declarative statement suitable for inspiring an audience. The
      phrase 「終わる ことは ない」 reinforces the absolute certainty of no failure. The use of standard polite
      forms like 「終わりません」 is common in speeches and does not carry specific gender or age implications,
      fitting a general inspirational tone.
  - english: He certainly has talent, but he lacks effort.
    japanese:
      - 彼 に は 才能 {こそ あれ}、努力 が 欠け て いる。
      - 彼 に は 才能 {こそ あれ}、努力 が 足り ない ね。
      - 彼 に は 才能 {こそ あれ}、怠け て いる ね。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 才能 は ある が、努力 が 欠け て いる。
        english: He has talent, but he lacks effort.
        hint: The speaker wants to strongly acknowledge the talent before immediately highlighting the
          crucial missing piece. 「こそあれ」 provides a more emphatic contrast than a simple 「は」 with 「が」.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 に は 才能 が ある けれど も、努力 が 欠け て いる。
        english: Although he has talent, he lacks effort.
        hint: While 「けれども」 conveys concession, 「こそあれ」 emphasizes the presence of talent as a primary point,
          making the lack of effort a more direct and impactful contrast in this reflective context.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 に は 才能 が あっ て も、努力 が 欠け て いる。
        english: Even if he has talent, he lacks effort.
        hint: This implies talent is a concession, but the original emphatically states that talent *is
          certainly present*, followed by a lack of something else. We're looking for an emphatic acknowledgment
          of X, followed by a contrast.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 に は 才能 ばかり で、努力 が 欠け て いる。
        english: He only has talent, and lacks effort.
        hint: This suggests talent is the *only* thing he has, which is slightly different from 'he *certainly*
          has talent' while also lacking effort. We're looking for a strong acknowledgement of the first
          part.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 に は 努力 が ある どころ か、才能 が ある。
        english: Far from him having effort, he has talent.
        hint: This reverses the emphasis. The original highlights the presence of talent, *then* the lack
          of effort. We're looking for 'He certainly has talent, but lacks effort'.
    scene: A friend reflects on a mutual acquaintance's unfulfilled potential due to a lack of diligence.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The phrase 「才能こそあれ」 emphatically acknowledges the presence of talent. The casual tone, potentially
      including 「ね」 for softening, fits a conversation between friends. There are no explicit gender or
      age markers in the Japanese itself that would necessitate specifying speaker/listener gender or
      age.

        english: The swordsman's blazing desire for vengeance intensified, but it was certainly not cooling
          down.
        hint: The literary context of a novel benefits from the elevated and more emphatic tone of 「こそすれ」
          over a simple 「〜が」, providing greater dramatic impact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 剣士 の 復讐 心 は 火の手 を 強め て、決して 冷める どころ で は なかっ た。
        english: The swordsman's blazing desire for vengeance intensified, and was certainly not cooling
          down.
        hint: The scene requires a strong assertion of the direct opposite of cooling down. Using 「〜て」
          (te-form) would imply a sequence or mere connection, lacking the powerful contrast 「こそすれ」 provides.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 小説:だ が 実際 は、剣士 の 復讐 心 は 火の手 を 強め て も、決して 冷める どころ で は なかっ た の で ある。
        english: 'Novel: But in reality, even if the swordsman''s blazing desire for vengeance intensified,
          it was certainly not cooling down at all.'
        hint: This implies 'even if it intensified', which changes the meaning. The original states that
          it *was* intensifying and *certainly wasn't* cooling. We're looking for an emphatic assertion
          that it was intensifying *instead of* cooling.
      - competing_japanese:

          and was certainly not cooling down at all.'
        hint: While 'only intensifying' is close, it lacks the strong, almost corrective assertion of

          down, it was intensifying.'
        hint: This reverses the emphasis. The original highlights the presence of talent, *then* the lack
          of effort. We're looking for 'X is happening, and certainly Y is not happening'.
    scene: A dramatic passage from a historical novel, narrating a character's emotional state.
    register: bungo (literary)
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: The formal and somewhat archaic ending 「のである」 coupled with 「こそすれ」 is characteristic of literary
      Japanese (文語), emphasizing the author's strong assertion about the character's unwavering emotion.
      The phrase 「火の手 を 強め」 vividly describes the intensifying nature of the vengeance. Alternative literary
      expressions like 「燃え上がり」 and 「鎮まる 兆しは なかった」 or 「高まり」 and 「冷める よう な ことは なかった」 maintain the formal
      and dramatic tone suitable for a novel.

        english: Even if it's a difficult task, it won't be a waste of time, it will become a valuable
          experience.
        hint: This uses a concessive expression ('even if'), which is less emphatic on the certainty of
          the positive transformation. We're looking for a strong assertion that it *will certainly become*
          valuable.
      - competing_japanese:

          We're looking for a more formal and persuasive statement of transformation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 大変 な 仕事 ばかり で、無駄 に なる こと は ない、貴重 な 経験 に なる でしょう。
        english: It's only a difficult task, but it won't be a waste of time, it will become a valuable
          experience.
        hint: This emphasizes 'only' the difficulty, not the transformative aspect where something *becomes*
          valuable instead of being wasteful. We're looking for the emphatic 'become X, not Y'.
    scene: A university professor encourages a student struggling with a challenging research project.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: inspirational
    nuance: The use of 「こそなれ」 here emphasizes the transformative power of the difficult task into a valuable
      experience, reassuring the student that it won't be a waste. 「でしょう」 softens the assertion slightly,
      making it encouraging rather than a stern command. There are no explicit gender or age markers in

        english: We only prioritize customer satisfaction, and we won't compromise on quality.
        hint: This emphasizes 'only' prioritizing customer satisfaction, which might imply a lack of other
          considerations. The original more directly contrasts prioritizing satisfaction *with* not compromising
          quality. We're looking for a definitive, mutually exclusive assertion.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 顧客 満足 を 優先 し て も、品質 を 犠牲 に する こと は ない。
        english: Even if we prioritize customer satisfaction, we won't compromise on quality.
        hint: This implies a concession ('even if X'), suggesting a potential conflict. The original states
          a clear policy of prioritizing X *without* doing Y. We're looking for a direct and firm policy
          statement.
    scene: A CEO addresses stakeholders at a board meeting, outlining company policy.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「優先こそすれ」 strongly affirms the company's commitment to customer satisfaction while definitively
      denying any compromise on quality. This formal phrasing is typical in business settings when setting
      clear, non-negotiable policies. There are no explicit gender or age markers in the Japanese itself
      that would necessitate specifying speaker/listener gender or age.

    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「情熱こそあれ」 emphatically acknowledges the presence of passion, while directly pointing out the

      - 他人 を 批判 し {こそ すれ}、自分 を 顧みる こと は あり ませ ん。
      - 他人 を 批判 し {こそ すれ}、決して 自分 を 顧みる こと は ない。
      - 他人 を 批判 し {こそ すれ}、自分 を 顧みよう と し ない。
    english_literally: Others criticize certainly, oneself reflect to do will not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 他人 を 批判 する けれど、自分 を 顧みる こと は ない。
        english: He criticizes others, but he doesn't reflect on himself.
        hint: This is a simple observation using a conjunction ('but'). The original carries a stronger
          emphasis on 'certainly does X, but never does Y', expressing frustration or a definitive pattern
          of behavior. We're looking for an emphatic contrast.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 他人 を 批判 する ばかり で、自分 を 顧みる こと は ない。
        english: He only criticizes others, and he never reflects on himself.
        hint: While similar, this emphasizes 'only criticizing others', potentially implying a lack of
          other actions. The original focuses on the direct contrast between criticizing others and *never*
          self-reflecting. We're looking for a strong assertion of X and denial of Y.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 他人 を 批判 し て も、自分 を 顧みる こと は ない。
        english: Even if he criticizes others, he doesn't reflect on himself.
        hint: This implies a concession, as if criticizing others *might* lead to self-reflection. The
          original strongly states that he *does* criticize others, but *definitively does not* self-reflect.
          We're looking for a clear statement of two opposing actions.
    scene: A friend complains to another friend about a mutual acquaintance's behavior.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    nuance: 「批判しこそすれ」 highlights the action of criticizing others with strong emphasis, immediately followed
      by the denial of self-reflection. This is a common way to express frustration about someone's behavior
      in casual conversation, especially when complaining about a third party. There are no explicit gender
      or age markers in the Japanese itself that would necessitate specifying speaker/listener gender
      or age.
  - english: This new technology will surely become a driving force for innovation, not a mere passing
      trend.
    japanese:
      - この 新しい 技術 は、単なる 一過 性 の 流行 で は なく、イノベーション の 推進 力 に {こそ なれ}。
      - この 新しい 技術 は、単なる 一過 性 の 流行 で は なく、イノベーション の 推進 力 に {こそ なれ}、なる と 信じ て い ます。
      - この 新しい 技術 は、単なる 一過 性 の 流行 で は なく、イノベーション の 推進 力 と {こそ なれ}。
    english_literally: This new technology, mere passing trend not, innovation's driving force certainly
      become.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 新しい 技術 は、単なる 一過 性 の 流行 で は なく、イノベーション の 推進 力 に なる でしょう。
        english: This new technology will become a driving force for innovation, not a mere passing trend.
        hint: While predicting a positive outcome, this lacks the strong, assertive conviction that the
          technology *will certainly* transform into a driving force. We're looking for an emphatic statement
          about future development.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 新しい 技術 は、単なる 一過 性 の 流行 どころ か、イノベーション の 推進 力 に なる。
        english: Far from being a mere passing trend, this new technology will become a driving force
          for innovation.
        hint: While strong, 「〜どころか」 emphasizes the contrast by negating the initial idea. 「こそなれ」 focuses
          more on the *certainty* of transformation into the desired state. We're looking for an emphatic
          declaration of what it *will become*.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 新しい 技術 は、単なる 一過 性 の 流行 で も、イノベーション の 推進 力 に なる でしょう。
        english: Even if this new technology is a mere passing trend, it will become a driving force for
          innovation.
        hint: 'This sounds contradictory and weakens the assertion by conceding it might be a trend. The
          original makes a clear distinction: it is *not* a trend, but *will certainly become* a driving
          force. We''re looking for a definitive statement about its future role.'
    scene: A tech analyst presents a forecast on emerging technologies, aiming to convince investors.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「推進力にこそなれ」 asserts with high confidence that the technology will indeed become a driving force,
      counteracting the potential perception of it being a mere trend. This formal and assertive tone
      is fitting for an expert presenting a strong opinion or forecast. There are no explicit gender or
      age markers in the Japanese itself that would necessitate specifying speaker/listener gender or
      age.
  - english: While there may be minor issues, there are certainly no major problems.
    japanese:
      - 細か な 問題 {こそ あれ}、大きな 支障 は ない。
      - 細か な 問題 {こそ あれ}、大きな 支障 は あり ませ ん。
      - 細か な 問題 {こそ あれ}、大きな 支障 は 全く あり ませ ん。
      - 細か な 問題 {こそ あれ}、決して 大きな 支障 は ない。
    english_literally: Minor issues certainly exist, major obstacles are not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 細か な 問題 は ある が、大きな 支障 は ない。
        english: There are minor issues, but there are no major problems.
        hint: This is a simple factual statement using 「が」, which lacks the strong emphasis on the *certainty*
          of the absence of major problems. We're looking for an emphatic reassurance.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 細か な 問題 が あっ て も、大きな 支障 は ない。
        english: Even if there are minor issues, there are no major problems.
        hint: This uses a concessive ('even if') which implies that minor issues *could* potentially lead
          to major ones. The original definitively states that minor issues exist, but major ones *certainly
          do not*. We're looking for an assertion of minor issues combined with a definitive denial of
          major ones.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 細か な 問題 ばかり で、大きな 支障 は ない。
        english: There are only minor issues, and there are no major problems.
        hint: This emphasizes 'only minor issues', which is close but doesn't have the same direct emphatic
          acknowledgment of their existence before negating major ones. We're looking for a direct assertion
          of X followed by a strong denial of Y.
    scene: A project manager reports on the status of a complex project to a team or stakeholders.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「細かな問題こそあれ」 acknowledges minor issues but immediately and definitively negates the existence
      of major problems, offering reassurance. This is a common phrase in professional reports to convey
      a sense of control and stability despite small imperfections. There are no explicit gender or age
      markers in the Japanese itself that would necessitate specifying speaker/listener gender or age.
  - english: This old car certainly makes a lot of noise, but it never breaks down.
    japanese:
      - この 古い 車 は 音 {こそ すれ}、故障 する こと は ない。
      - この 古い 車 は 音 {こそ すれ}、故障 する こと は あり ませ ん。
      - この 古い 車 は 音 {こそ すれ}、決して 故障 する こと は あり ませ ん。
      - この 古い 車 は 音 {こそ すれ}、故障 なんか し ない。
    english_literally: This old car, sound certainly makes, break down will not do.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 古い 車 は 音 が する けれど も、故障 する こと は ない。
        english: This old car makes noise, but it doesn't break down.
        hint: This uses a simple conjunction 'but'. We're looking for a more emphatic contrast between
          making noise and never breaking down.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 古い 車 は 音 が する ばかり で、故障 する こと は ない。
        english: This old car only makes noise, and it doesn't break down.
        hint: This emphasizes that it *only* makes noise, not that it *certainly* makes noise while *never*
          breaking down. We're looking for a strong assertion of the first part, followed by a strong
          denial of the second.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 古い 車 は 音 が し て も、故障 する こと は ない。
        english: Even if this old car makes noise, it doesn't break down.
        hint: This suggests a concession ('even if'). The original expresses that one action certainly
          happens, but the other absolutely does not. We're looking for a definitive statement of action
          and non-action.
    scene: A mechanic explains the quirks of an old, reliable car to a customer.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The phrase 「音こそすれ」 emphasizes that the car definitely makes noise, setting up a strong contrast
      with the subsequent negation 「故障する ことは ない」, meaning it reliably doesn't break down. This structure
      conveys a balanced, almost reassuring, assessment of an object's characteristics.
  - english: I may cry, but I will never give up.
    japanese:
      - 涙 を 流し {こそ すれ}、諦める こと は ない。
      - 涙 を 流し {こそ すれ}、諦める こと は あり ませ ん。
      - 涙 を 流し {こそ すれ}、決して 諦める こと は ない。
      - 涙 を 流し {こそ すれ}、絶対 に 諦め ない。
    english_literally: Tears flow certainly, give up will not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 涙 を 流す けれど も、諦める こと は ない。
        english: I cry, but I won't give up.
        hint: This is a simple conjunctive statement. We're looking for a stronger, more emphatic declaration
          of an action and the resolute denial of another.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 涙 を 流し て も、諦める こと は ない。
        english: Even if I cry, I won't give up.
        hint: This implies a concession ('even if'). The original makes a definite assertion that crying
          might happen, but giving up absolutely will not. We're looking for an emphatic statement of
          contrast.
    scene: A determined individual reflects on their emotional state after a setback, steeling themselves
      to continue.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The use of 「涙を 流しこそすれ」 strongly emphasizes the act of crying, yet immediately negates the
      possibility of giving up. This highlights resilience and determination, conveying that while emotional
      expression is possible, capitulation is not. This direct and resolute phrasing is characteristic
      of personal reflection or self-encouragement.
  - english: While it certainly has theoretical value, it offers no practical application.
    japanese:
      - 理論 的 な 価値 {こそ あれ}、現実 的 な 応用 性 は ない。
      - 理論 的 な 価値 {こそ あれ}、現実 的 な 応用 性 は あり ませ ん。
    english_literally: Theoretical value certainly exists, practical applicability is not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 理論 的 な 価値 は ある が、現実 的 な 応用 性 は ない。
        english: It has theoretical value, but it offers no practical application.
        hint: This is a simple factual statement using 「が」, which lacks the strong emphasis on the *certainty*
          of the theoretical value before highlighting the lack of practical application. We're looking
          for an emphatic acknowledgment of the former.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 理論 的 な 価値 が あっ て も、現実 的 な 応用 性 は ない。
        english: Even if it has theoretical value, it offers no practical application.
        hint: This uses a concessive ('even if') which implies that theoretical value *could* potentially
          lead to practical application, but doesn't. The original definitively states that theoretical
          value exists, but practical application *certainly does not*. We're looking for an assertion
          of theoretical value combined with a definitive denial of practical application.
    scene: An academic discussing a philosophical concept during a seminar.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「こそあれ」 emphatically acknowledges the presence of theoretical value, immediately
      followed by the direct negation of practical application. This structure is suitable for academic
      discourse where precise distinctions and strong assertions are valued. There are no explicit gender
      or age markers in the Japanese itself that would necessitate specifying speaker/listener gender
      or age.
post_example_writeup: The nuance of 「こそすれ〜ない」 lies in its formal and emphatic nature. It is used to correct
  a misconception or highlight a stark contrast, often implying that the positive aspect is the *only*
  true outcome, while the negative one is unequivocally rejected. This makes it a powerful rhetorical
  tool for assertion and clarification. The various conjugations of the preceding verb (e.g., する, なる,
  ある) allow for expressing this emphatic contrast with different types of actions or states.
