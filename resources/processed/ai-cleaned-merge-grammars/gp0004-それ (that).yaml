etymology: 「それ」is part of the fundamental Japanese demonstrative series, often referred to as the こ・そ・あ・ど
  (ko-so-a-do) series. This series categorizes items or concepts based on their proximity to the speaker
  and listener. 「そ-」words like 「それ」and「そちら」refer to things near the listener or within the listener's
  sphere of influence, distinct from the speaker's immediate vicinity (こ-words) and things distant from
  both (あ-words). Historically, this system developed to clearly delineate spatial and conceptual relationships
  in communication.
writeup: |-
  The demonstrative pronoun 「それ」is a core component of Japanese communication, crucial for referring to objects, ideas, or situations. It belongs to the こ・そ・あ・ど (ko-so-a-do) series, which systematically indicates proximity relative to the speaker and listener. Specifically, 「それ」refersto something that is physically close to the listener but not the speaker, or something that has just been mentioned in the conversation and is thus conceptually shared between the speaker and listener.

  In everyday conversation, 「それ」is used very frequently. For instance, if you are pointing to an object that is closer to your friend than to yourself, you would use 「それ」. If you are discussing a topic that was just brought up, 「それ」can refer back to that topic without needing to repeat the noun.

  Understanding the subtle distinctions between 「これ」,「それ」, and 「あれ」is essential. While 「これ」refers to something near the speaker and 「あれ」to something distant from both, 「それ」bridges the gap by focusing on the listener's proximity or shared conversational context. This makes 「それ」invaluable for collaborative discussions, clarifications, and building upon previously established points.

  - term: これ (this)
    meaning: This (near the speaker)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「これ」refers to something physically close to the speaker or an idea currently being expressed
      by the speaker, whereas 「それ」refers to something near the listener or a topic already introduced.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:これ・それ・あれ・どれ (demonstrative pronouns)
  - term: あれ (that, over there)
    meaning: That (over there, distant from both speaker and listener)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あれ」refers to something far away from both the speaker and the listener, often something neither
      can immediately touch, while 「それ」is within the listener's reach or shared context.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:これ・それ・あれ・どれ (demonstrative pronouns)
  - term: その (that・near listener)
    meaning: That (near the listener, modifying a noun)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「その」is a demonstrative determiner that *modifies* a noun (e.g., その 本 - that book), indicating
      the noun is near the listener or conceptually understood. 「それ」is a demonstrative *pronoun* that
      *replaces* a noun (e.g., それは本です - That is a book).
    grammar_point: この (this)
  - term: こんな・そんな・あんな・どんな (such a・kind of)
    meaning: Such a, like that (describing quality)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While derived from 「それ」, 「そんな」describes the *quality* or *type* of something (e.g., そんな人 -
      such a person), rather than referring to a specific item or concept like 「それ」does.
    grammar_point: そんな (such)
  - term: そちら (that way, polite)
    meaning: That way, there (polite direction/place)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そちら」is a polite demonstrative for directions or places near the listener. While related to
      「それ」in its 'so-' prefix, 「それ」is a general pronoun for objects/concepts, whereas 「そちら」is specifically
      for locations, directions, or can politely refer to a person/group.
    grammar_point: こっち (this way・this direction)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'When distinguishing between 「これ」, 「それ」, and 「あれ」, remember the simple rule:
  「これ」is for things near *me* (the speaker), 「それ」is for things near *you* (the listener), and 「あれ」is for
  things far from *both* of us. This spatial relationship also extends to conversational context: 「これ」for
  what I''m talking about, 「それ」for what you just mentioned, and 「あれ」for something we both know but isn''t
  immediately present. For 「その」, just think of it as 「それ」''s adjective form; it needs a noun after it.
  Lastly, while 「そんな」and 「そちら」share the ''so-'' sound, they express ''such a quality'' and ''that direction/way''
  respectively, rather than directly pointing to an item like 「それ」.'
