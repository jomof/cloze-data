jlpt: N3
etymology: The suffix 「がる」 originates from the classical verb 「がる」, which meant 'to act in a certain way'
  or 'to show signs of (an emotion).' It evolved to be attached to adjective stems and some nouns to indicate
  that someone is exhibiting a quality or emotion outwardly, based on observable behavior, rather than
  experiencing it directly. This linguistic development highlights the Japanese focus on external appearance
  and inferred states, especially when discussing others' internal worlds.
writeup: The grammar point 「な-Adjective[がる]」 is used to describe when someone (or something) exhibits
  outward signs of a feeling or state typically expressed by a な-adjective. For example, from the な-adjective
  「嫌い (きらい)」meaning 'dislike,' we can form 「嫌がる (いやがる)」, which means 'to act like one dislikes' or 'to
  show signs of disliking.' This construction is crucial because, in Japanese, one generally does not
  directly state another person's internal feelings or desires as facts. Instead, when talking about someone
  else's emotions or physical states, we rely on observable behavior. While you would say 「私は悲しいです (わたしはかなしいです)」
  (I am sad) for yourself, you would say 「彼は悲しがっています (かれはかなしがっています)」 (He is acting sad / He seems sad)
  for someone else. This applies similarly to な-adjectives. Once the 「がる」 suffix is added to the stem
  of a な-adjective, the resulting form functions as a regular Godan (Group 1) verb. This means it can
  be conjugated into various forms, such as 「〜がらない (negative plain)」、「〜がった (past plain)」、「〜がります (polite
  non-past)」, and most commonly, the progressive form 「〜がっている (is showing signs of)」. The transformation
  into a verb also means it can take direct objects with 「を」, such as 「野菜を嫌がる (やさいをいやがる)」 (to act like
  one dislikes vegetables). **Important Considerations:** *   **Third-Person Use Only:** 「〜がる」 is almost
  exclusively used for observing third-person subjects. Using it for oneself 「私は嫌がります」 is unnatural because
  you know your own feelings directly. *   **Focus on Outward Behavior:** The emphasis is on the observable
  behavior that suggests an internal state, not on the internal state itself. *   **Common Forms:** The
  「〜がっている」 form is particularly common, indicating an ongoing display of the feeling or state.

  - term: い-Adjective[がる] (showing signs of)
    meaning: to act like; to show signs of feeling (used for third person's emotions/states with i-adjectives)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both な-Adjective[がる] and い-Adjective[がる] express showing signs of feeling, they differ
      only in the type of adjective they attach to. The core meaning and usage are identical. This grammar
      point focuses on the な-adjective application.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[がる] (showing signs of)
  - term: ~そうだ (it seems・looks like)
    meaning: to seem, to look like (based on appearance)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜がる」 is used specifically for expressing someone else's observable emotional or physical
      state (e.g., 'acting cold', 'acting sad'). 「〜そうだ」 is more broadly used for general appearance or
      likelihood (e.g., 'looks delicious', 'seems likely to rain'). While both involve inference, 「〜がる」
      implies an internal feeling manifesting outwardly, whereas 「〜そうだ」 describes a general impression.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]・[い-Adjective-stem]・[な-Adjective]そうだ (it seems・looks like)'
  - term: ~らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)
    meaning: it seems, I hear (based on external information or common knowledge)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜がる」 is based on direct observation of behavior. 「〜らしい」 is based on external evidence, hearsay,
      or something being typical of a person or situation. For example, 「彼は部長らしい (かれはぶちょうらしい)」 (He seems
      like the manager / He acts like a manager) based on his demeanor, not necessarily a direct emotional
      state.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
  - term: ~ようだ・~みたいだ (seems・like)
    meaning: seems like, looks like, similar to
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜がる」 focuses on an observable display of an internal state. 「〜ようだ」 and 「〜みたいだ」 are broader
      expressions for resemblance, comparison, or inference about a situation or fact, not necessarily
      an individual's emotional display. For instance, 「まるで夢のようだ (まるでゆめのようだ)」 (It's like a dream).
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「な-Adjective[がる]」, 「〜そうだ」, 「〜らしい」, and 「〜ようだ・〜みたいだ」 all involve expressing
  something that 'seems' or 'appears' to be the case, they have distinct applications. 「〜がる」 is specifically
  for describing how another person *acts* as if they have a certain emotion or physical state. It transforms
  the adjective into a verb denoting this outward behavior. In contrast, 「〜そうだ」 describes general appearances
  (e.g., 'looks tasty'), 「〜らしい」 conveys an impression based on information or typical characteristics,
  and 「〜ようだ・〜みたいだ」 are used for broader comparisons or inferences about situations. The key is that 「〜がる」
  describes a *person's* behavior reflecting an internal state.

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「な-Adjective[がる]」 is used to convey a third person's
  emotional or physical state through their observable actions. Notice the common use of the 「〜がっている」
  form to describe ongoing expressions of feeling, and how it often takes an object marked by 「を」, functioning
  like a transitive verb. This allows for nuanced descriptions of behavior, which is essential for polite
  and accurate communication in Japanese when discussing others.
