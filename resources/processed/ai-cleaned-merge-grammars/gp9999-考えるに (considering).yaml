jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Primarily used in written language, formal speeches, academic discussions, or analytical
    contexts.
  function: To introduce a judgment, conclusion, or opinion that has been arrived at through careful thought
    or deliberation.
  nuance: Implies that the subsequent statement is a result of a reasoned, analytical, or objective thought
    process, rather than a mere feeling or spontaneous idea. It lends an air of thoughtfulness and authority
    to the statement.
etymology: The expression 「考えるに」 combines the dictionary form of the verb 「考える」 (kangaeru), meaning 'to
  think' or 'to consider,' with the particle 「に」. In this context, 「に」 functions as a conjunctive particle,
  similar to 'in' or 'upon,' indicating the basis or condition for the following statement. This usage
  of 「に」 with verbs like 「考える」 and 「思う」 to denote a foundation for judgment is rooted in classical Japanese,
  contributing to its formal and analytical tone. It signifies that the speaker's subsequent remark is
  grounded in careful contemplation or analysis of the preceding matter.
writeup: |-
  「考えるに」 is a formal and somewhat literary expression used to introduce a statement that is the result of careful thought or consideration. It translates most closely to 'considering (that)...', 'when one considers...', or 'thinking about it...'. It suggests that the speaker or writer has deliberated on a certain matter and is now presenting a reasoned conclusion or opinion. This phrase often appears in formal speeches, essays, or analytical texts, indicating a logical progression of thought.

  Unlike more direct expressions of opinion, 「考えるに」 implies a process of internal reflection or external evaluation. It positions the speaker's subsequent statement as a thoughtful deduction rather than a mere feeling or spontaneous idea. It's particularly useful when you want to convey that your conclusion is well-founded and has been arrived at through a rational process. While it can theoretically be used with other verbs ending in '-eru' followed by 'ni', its most common and natural usage is with 「考える」 and occasionally 「思う」.

  - term: 思うに
    meaning: in my opinion; it seems to me
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「思うに」 is more about expressing a personal feeling or subjective impression, often without
      as much emphasis on a logical or analytical process. 「考えるに」 implies a more deliberate and reasoned
      consideration.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:思うに (in my opinion・it seems to me)
  - term: 考えれば
    meaning: if one thinks about it
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「考えれば」 is a conditional form, setting up a hypothetical situation ('if you think about it,
      then...'). 「考えるに」, conversely, introduces a conclusion that has already been considered, serving
      as a formal introductory phrase for the resultant thought.

  - term: に照らして・に照らすと
    meaning: in light of; in accordance with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に照らして」 means 'in light of' or 'according to' something, implying a comparison or judgment
      against an existing standard, fact, or principle. While it also involves consideration, it's more
      about conformity or assessment against a benchmark, whereas 「考えるに」 is about deriving a new conclusion
      from internal deliberation.
    grammar_point: に照らして・に照らすと (in light of)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「考えるに」 expresses a conclusion reached through careful deliberation,
  「思うに」 conveys a personal impression. 「考えれば」 sets up a hypothetical condition, asking the listener to
  consider 'if' something were true. Lastly, 「に照らして」 judges something against a known standard or principle.
  Each phrase subtly guides the listener to interpret the following statement differently, reflecting
  the nature of the preceding mental process or basis for the statement.
