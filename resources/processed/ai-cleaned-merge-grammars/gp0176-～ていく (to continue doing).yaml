pronunciation:

formation:
  Verb (Te-form) + いく: Indicates that an action continues from a certain point forward, implying movement
    away from the speaker or a progression into the future.
  Verb (Dictionary form) + ように + して + いく: Expresses an ongoing effort or intention to proceed in a particular
    way.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  function: Indicates the continuation or progression of an action or a gradual change over time, often
    implying movement away from the current state or point of origin.
  nuance: This auxiliary verb adds a sense of progression or movement away from the speaker's current
    position or a past point in time. It describes a change that unfolds over time, distinguishing it
    from a static state or an action that happens at a single moment. It can describe physical movement
    away or a metaphorical 'movement' into the future or a new state.
etymology: The auxiliary verb 「行く」, *iku*, literally means "to go". When attached to the te-form of another
  verb, it describes the continuation or progression of that action or state from a certain point forward,
  metaphorically extending the idea of 'going' to the action itself. The directional aspect of 'going'
  is thus transferred to the ongoing process, implying a movement away from the start point of the action
  or change.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「～ていく」, *te iku*, is used to express the continuation of an action or a gradual change from a certain point in time. This 'point in time' can be the present moment, indicating what will continue to happen in the future, or a point in the past, describing what has continued since then. The nuance of 「いく」 here is that the action or change progresses and moves *away* from the starting point, whether physically or metaphorically. Think of it as "going on" or "keeping" in English, but with an inherent sense of outward movement or progression over time.

  For example, if you say 「寒くなっていく」, it means it's getting colder and the coldness is progressing or moving away from the current state, suggesting a continued decline in temperature. Similarly, 「話していく」 implies continuing to talk, with the conversation moving forward from its current point. This contrasts with other expressions of continuation that do not carry the directional nuance of 「いく」.

  While 「～ていく」 itself is not gender-specific, the context and accompanying vocabulary can influence the overall tone and perceived register. It is widely used across all age groups and in various situations.
false_friends:
  - term: 行く
    meaning: to go
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「行く」 by itself means 'to go,' referring to physical movement to a destination. In contrast,
      「～ていく」 functions as an auxiliary verb, indicating the continuation or progression of an action or
      state over time, often with a sense of moving away from a current point. The key difference lies
      in whether 「行く」 is the main verb of movement or an auxiliary verb adding nuance to another verb.
    grammar_point: 行く (to go)
  - term: ～てくる
    meaning: to come (continue, become)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～ていく」 implies progression or movement *away* from the speaker or a specific point in time,
      suggesting a future-oriented or departing direction. 「～てくる」, its counterpart, implies progression
      or movement *towards* the speaker or a past-to-present direction, suggesting something that has
      continued up to the present or is approaching.
    grammar_point: てくる (movement towards or gradual change)
  - term: ～始める
    meaning: to begin to (do something)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～ていく」 emphasizes the continuation or progression of an action or state *from* a certain point
      forward. 「～始める」 focuses specifically on the *commencement* or *initiation* of an action, indicating
      when it started rather than its ongoing development. 「～始める」 marks the starting line, while 「～ていく」
      describes the journey itself, moving forward from that line.
    grammar_point: はじめる (to start doing)
  - term: 続ける
    meaning: to continue
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「続ける」 simply means 'to continue' an action or state. While it denotes duration, it lacks the
      inherent directional nuance of 'moving away' or 'progressing forward in time' that 「～ていく」 provides.
      「～ていく」 often implies a change or development over time, whereas 「続ける」 can be used for static continuation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:続ける (to continue doing)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  When using 「～ていく」, it is essential to distinguish it from the plain verb 「行く」, which simply means "to go." While both involve the word 「行く」, their grammatical functions and meanings are distinct. The auxiliary 「～ていく」 is always preceded by a verb in its te-form.

  Furthermore, pay close attention to the contrast between 「～ていく」 and 「～てくる」. The former emphasizes a sense of moving forward or away from a current state or point of origin, implying a future-oriented or outward progression. For example, 「暖かくなっていく」 means it is gradually becoming warmer, moving away from a colder state. The latter, 「～てくる」, indicates a movement towards the speaker, either literally or metaphorically, suggesting that something has continued from a past point up to the present, or is approaching. For example, 「暖かくなってくる」 would mean it is gradually becoming warmer as it approaches the present moment or the speaker's location. Understanding this directional nuance is key to using these expressions correctly.

  Finally, compare 「～ていく」 with 「～始める」. While both relate to processes, 「～始める」 focuses on the *initiation* of an action or state (e.g., 「走り始める」 - to start running), indicating the very beginning. In contrast, 「～ていく」 describes the *continuation* or *progression* of an action *from* a certain point (e.g., 「走っていく」 - to continue running, to run off). 「～始める」 marks the starting line, while 「～ていく」 describes the journey itself, moving forward from that line.

  When considering the simple verb 「続ける」 (tsuzukeru), which means 'to continue', it's important to note the nuance it lacks compared to 「～ていく」. While 「続ける」 merely indicates that an action or state persists without interruption, 「～ていく」 adds the dimension of progression, development, or movement *forward* in time or space from a given point. For instance, 「勉強を続ける」 means 'to continue studying' (just keeping it up), while 「勉強を続けていく」 implies 'to continue studying, progressing forward' (with a sense of development or movement toward a future state). Therefore, 「～ていく」 is often used when there's an implied trajectory or a noticeable change occurring over time, distinguishing it from a simple, static continuation.
examples:
  - english: From now on, I will continue my Japanese studies every day.
    japanese:
      - これ から、日本 語 の 勉強 を 毎日 続け て {いき ます}。
      - これ から、毎日 日本 語 の 勉強 を 続け て {まいり ます}。
      - 今 から、日本 語 の 勉強 を 毎日 続け て {まいり ます}。
    english_literally: From now, Japanese study every day continuing will go on.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ から、日本 語 の 勉強 を 毎日 {続け ます}。
        english: From now on, I will continue my Japanese studies every day.
        hint: This sentence states the continuation of the study, but lacks the nuance of progression
          or moving forward into the future that 「～ていく」 provides. We're looking for the progression of
          the study.
    scene: A student informs their teacher about their new study resolution, emphasizing a sustained effort.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「～ていきます」 with the formal 「～ます」 ending makes this a polite and determined statement
      suitable for addressing a teacher. It implies a continuous forward progression of the study. The
      placement of 「毎日」 (every day) can vary, but the meaning remains consistent. 「まいります」 is a more humble
      form of 「行きます」, showing respect to the listener.
    etymology: 「まいります」 is the humble form of 「行く」 and 「来る」, reflecting a speaker's humble approach to
      an action or movement.
  - english: From that day, he went on living alone.
    japanese:
      - その 日 から、彼 は 一人 で 生き て {いっ た}。
      - あ の 日 から、彼 は 独り で 生き て {いっ た} の だ。
      - そ の 日 から、彼 は 孤独 に 生き て {いっ た}。
    english_literally: From that day, he alone living went on.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 日 から、彼 は 一人 で {生き て い た}。
        english: From that day, he was living alone.
        hint: This sentence describes that he *was* living alone, but doesn't convey the sense of *how*
          he went on living alone or the progression of that state, which 「～ていった」 emphasizes. We're looking
          for the progression of the state.
    scene: A narrator describes a character's life change after a significant event.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The casual past form 「～ていった」 is common in narratives to describe a continuous state or action
      that progressed from a past point. It adds a sense of flow to the character's life story. The addition
      of 「のだ」 emphasizes the descriptive nature, often used in explanations or narratives. 「独り」 (hitori)
      and 「孤独」 (kodoku) are alternative ways to express 'alone' or 'loneliness', adding slightly different
      shades of meaning.
    etymology: 「のだ」 is a contracted form of 「のです」, providing an explanatory or emphatic nuance.
  - english: As summer approaches, it gradually gets hotter.
    japanese:
      - 夏 が 近づき、だんだん 暑く なっ て {いく}。
      - 夏 が 近づく に つれ て、ますます 暑く なっ て {いく} だろう。
      - 夏 が 迫り、次第 に 暑く なっ て {いく}。
    english_literally: Summer approaches, gradually becoming hot goes on.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 夏 が 近づき、だんだん 暑く {なる}。
        english: As summer approaches, it gradually becomes hot.
        hint: This simply states that it becomes hot. 「～ていく」 adds the nuance of a gradual, continuous
          change that progresses over time, moving away from the current state. We're looking for the
          gradual progression of change.
    scene: Someone observes the changing seasons and discusses the weather.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: This usage of 「～ていく」 with an adjective (暑い) highlights a gradual, ongoing change over time.
      It's a common way to describe natural processes like seasonal changes. 「近づく に つれて」 (as it approaches)
      and 「迫り」 (drawing near) are more formal or literary alternatives for 'as it approaches'. 「ますます」
      (increasingly) and 「次第に」 (gradually) can replace 「だんだん」 to emphasize the progressive nature.
    etymology: 「につれて」 indicates a proportional relationship, meaning 'as X happens, Y also happens'.
  - english: From now on, I think I'll try to pay more attention to my health.
    japanese:
      - これ から、もっと 健康 に 気 を つける よう に し て {いこう} と 思う。
      - 今 から、もっと 健康 に 気 を 配る よう に し て {いこう} と 思う。
      - 今後 は、さらに 健康 面 を 意識 し て {いこう} と 思い ます。
    english_literally: From now, more health paying attention to like doing will go on and think.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ から、もっと 健康 に 気 を つける よう に {し よう} と 思う。
        english: From now on, I think I'll try to pay more attention to my health.
        hint: While this expresses an intention to make an effort, 「～ていこう」 emphasizes the intention to
          *continue* that effort, suggesting a sustained future progression. We're looking for an intention
          for continued effort.
    scene: A person reflects on their future health habits during a conversation with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: volitional (～よう)
    nuance: The volitional form 「～ていこう」 expresses an intention to continue an action or effort. The phrase
      「～ようにしていく」 means 'to make an effort to continue doing something', emphasizing a sustained endeavor.
      「気 を 配る」 (to pay attention) is a slightly more polite alternative to 「気 を つける」. 「今後 は」 (from now
      on, future) and 「さらに」 (furthermore) can be used for a slightly more formal tone, especially with
      「～と思います」 (I think) instead of 「～と思う」.
    etymology: 「気 を 配る」 literally means 'to distribute one's spirit or attention', implying a broader
      focus on care.
  - english: Please continue to proceed with this project as is.
    japanese:
      - この プロジェクト は、この まま 進め て {いっ て ください}。
      - 本 プロジェクト は、現状 の まま 続行 し て {いっ て いただけ ます} と 幸い です。
      - 当該 案件 は、現状 維持 で 進め て {いっ て 頂け ます} でしょう か。
    english_literally: This project, as is, proceeding please go on.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この プロジェクト は、この まま {続け て ください}。
        english: Please continue this project as is.
        hint: This is a direct request to continue the project. 「～ていってください」 specifically requests that
          the project continue *moving forward* or *progression* from its current state, implying a dynamic
          continuation. We're looking for a command to continue with a sense of forward movement.
    scene: A manager instructs their team to keep working on a project without any changes.
    register: formal
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The phrase 「～ていってください」 is a polite command, emphasizing the continuation of the action into
      the future. It's suitable for professional settings where continuous work is expected. For higher
      formality, especially in business, one might use expressions like 「～ていって いただけ ます と 幸い です」 (It would
      be fortunate if you would continue to do X) or 「～ていって 頂けます でしょう か」 (Would you be able to continue
      to do X?), using more formal terms like 「本 プロジェクト」 (this project) and 「現状 維持」 (status quo maintenance).
    etymology: 「幸い です」 (saiwai desu) literally means 'it is happiness' or 'it is fortunate', a humble
      way to express gratitude or a request.
  - english: I want to continue to cherish and nurture my relationship with you.
    japanese:
      - 君 と の 関係 を 大事 に 育て て {いき たい} と 思っ て いる ん だ。
      - 君 と の 関係 を 大切 に 育ん で {いき たい} と 願っ て いる ん だ。
      - あなた と の 関係 を 大事 に 育ん で {いき たい} と 思っ て い ます。
    english_literally: With you relationship cherishing nurturing want to go on and thinking am.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 君 と の 関係 を 大事 に {育て たい} と 思っ て いる ん だ。
        english: I want to cherish and nurture my relationship with you.
        hint: This sentence expresses a desire to nurture the relationship. 「～ていきたい」 adds the nuance of
          wanting to nurture it *continuously* and *progressively* into the future, emphasizing the ongoing
          development. We're looking for a desire for continuous nurturing.
    scene: A man expresses his feelings to his girlfriend, emphasizing the long-term aspect of their relationship.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: intimate
    conjugation: desiderative (～たい)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The combination of the desiderative form 「～たい」 with 「～ていく」 expresses a desire for an ongoing,
      continuous process. The use of 「君」 (kimi) and the casual 「～んだ」 creates an intimate and heartfelt
      tone, often used by male speakers. 「大切 に 育んで」 (taisetsu ni hagukunde) is a more refined way to say
      'nurture carefully'. Using 「あなた」 and 「～と思っています」 would make the expression slightly more formal,
      though still intimate depending on context.
    etymology: 「育む」 (hagukumu) means to foster or nurture, implying growth and development over time.
  - english: I decided I won't continue that bad habit anymore.
    japanese:
      - そんな 悪い 習慣 は、もう 続け て {いか ない} と 決め た。
      - あんな 悪癖 は、もう 継続 し て {いか ない} と 決心 し た。
      - もう、あの 悪しき 習慣 を 続け て {いく} こと は ない と 決め た。
    english_literally: That kind of bad habit, no longer continuing will not go on and decided.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな 悪い 習慣 は、もう {続け ない} と 決め た。
        english: I decided I won't continue that bad habit anymore.
        hint: While this clearly states the decision not to continue, 「～ていかない」 emphasizes the cessation
          of something that was *progressing* or *ongoing* , implying a definitive halt to a continuous
          behavior. We're looking for a decision to stop something that was in progression.
    scene: Someone makes a firm decision to break a long-standing bad habit.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: The negative form 「～ていかない」 emphasizes the cessation of an ongoing action, indicating a definitive
      break from a continuous process. It implies a conscious decision to stop something that has been
      progressing. 「悪癖」 (akueki) means 'bad habit' or 'vice', often used for ingrained bad habits. 「継続
      し て いかない」 is a more formal way to say 'will not continue'. The third option uses 「～こと は ない」 (there
      will not be a doing of X) to express certainty about not continuing, which is very firm.
    etymology: 「悪癖」 combines 「悪」 (bad) and 「癖」 (habit/クセ), making a strong compound for negative habits.
  - english: Even if it's tough, I believe I can continue to grow.
    japanese:
      - 大変 で も、自分 は 成長 し て {いける} と 信じ て いる。
      - 困難 で も、私 は 成長 し て {いける} と 確信 し て いる。
      - どんな に 厳しく て も、私 は 伸び て {いける} と 考え て いる。
    english_literally: Even if difficult, I myself growing can go on and believe am.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 大変 で も、自分 は {成長 できる} と 信じ て いる。
        english: Even if it's tough, I believe I can grow.
        hint: This only indicates the ability to grow. 「～ていける」 adds the nuance of the *ability to continue*
          growing or progressing into the future, emphasizing an ongoing development. We're looking for
          the ability to continue growing.
    scene: A student reflects on their personal development journey, maintaining an optimistic outlook
      despite challenges.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: potential (～られる/～える)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The potential form 「～ていける」 combined with 「成長」 emphasizes the ability to continue growing or
      progressing, suggesting an inner strength or belief in one's capacity for ongoing development. 「大変
      でも」 indicates overcoming difficulties, making the continuation of growth a personal achievement.
      「伸びていける」 is a slightly more informal alternative to 「成長していける」, suitable for casual reflection.
  - english: If things continue like this, society might become even more difficult to live in.
    japanese:
      - この まま {続い て いけ ば}、社会 は もっと 住み にくく なる か も しれ ない。
      - 現状 が {続い て いけ ば}、社会 の 状況 は さらに 厳しく なる か も しれ ない。
      - この まま の 状態 が {推移 し て いけ ば}、世の中 は いよいよ 住み づらく なる だろう。
    english_literally: This way continuing if, society even more difficult to live will become perhaps.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この まま {続け ば}、社会 は もっと 住み にくく なる か も しれ ない。
        english: If this situation continues, society might become even more difficult to live in.
        hint: While 「続けば」 implies continuation, 「～ていけば」 specifically highlights a progression or gradual
          change *over time* into a new state. We're looking for a progressive change in the situation.
    scene: A sociologist discusses potential future challenges during a public lecture.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: conditional (～ば)
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The conditional 「～ていけば」 here points to a hypothetical future scenario if the current trend
      (「この まま 続い て」) continues. It implies a progression into a potentially negative state. The formal
      register suits a general societal commentary. 「推移 し て いけば」 is a more formal and academic way to
      express 'if things transition/progression'.
  - english: From now on, I won't continue to rely on others.
    japanese:
      - これ から は、もう 他人 に 頼っ て {いき ませ ん}。
      - 今後 は、もはや 他者 に 依存 し て {いか ない}。
      - これ から、誰 か に 頼る こと は {し ない で いき ます}。
    english_literally: From now, no longer others on relying will not go on.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ から は、もう 他人 に {頼り ませ ん}。
        english: From now on, I won't rely on others.
        hint: This simply states a future non-reliance. 「～ていきません」 adds the nuance of a definitive decision
          *not to continue* a previous pattern of behavior, implying a departure from past habits. We're
          looking for a decision to stop a continuous behavior.
    scene: A young professional, feeling overwhelmed by past dependencies, declares a new commitment to
      independence.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The negative polite 「～ていきません」 expresses a resolute decision not to continue a certain action
      or state, with a sense of moving away from that past behavior. It's a polite but firm declaration
      of intent. The use of 「これ から は」 emphasizes a change in future behavior. 「他人」 and 「他者」 both mean
      'others', with 「他者」 being slightly more formal. 「依存」 is a more formal verb for 'rely'.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the precise nuance of 「～ていく」 in these examples is crucial. It is not
  merely about continuation, but about the direction and progression of that continuation. It highlights
  how an action or state moves forward from a certain point, often implying a change or development over
  time.
