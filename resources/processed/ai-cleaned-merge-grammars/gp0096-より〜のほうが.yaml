    "etymology": "「より」 (yori) translates to \"than\" or \"from,\" indicating a point of comparison or origin. 「のほうが」 (no hou ga) literally means \"the direction of\" or \"the side of,\" implying a preference or a higher degree of something. When combined, they form a structure that clearly delineates two items and highlights which one possesses a certain quality to a greater extent, or which one is preferred.",
    "writeup": "「より〜のほうが」is a fundamental grammar pattern used for making comparisons in Japanese. It means \"to be more ~ than ~\" or \"prefer ~ over ~\". The particle 「より」 (yori) marks the item being compared *against* (the lesser or less preferred item), while 「のほうが」 (no hou ga) points to the item that is *more* of the stated quality or the preferred one.\n\nWhile commonly followed by an adjective (e.g., 楽しい `tanoshii` - fun, 大きい `ookii` - big), 「のほうが」 can also precede verbs expressing desire or preference, such as 「したい」 (shitai - want to do) or 「ほしい」 (hoshii - want/desire). For instance, one might say 「XよりYのほうがしたい」 (I want to do Y more than X).\n\n**Particle Usage: を vs. が**\n\nWhen expressing desire or preference with verbs like 「したい」 or 「ほしい」, both 「が」 (ga) and 「を」 (o) can be used after 「のほう」. The choice subtly shifts the emphasis:\n*   Using 「のほうが」: Emphasizes the **overall statement of preference** or the desire itself. This is often used with 「ほしい」 when wanting an item.\n*   Using 「のほうを」: Emphasizes the **object or action being preferred**. This is very common with 「したい」 when expressing a preference for one activity over another.\n\nBoth particles are generally acceptable and sound natural in these contexts, though 「のほうが」 is often perceived as slightly more natural with 「ほしい」.\n\n**Implicit Comparisons with より**\n\nOccasionally, 「より」 can be used by itself to indicate a comparison, with 「のほうが」 implicitly understood. In such cases, 「より」 means \"more than\" or \"relatively.\" For example, 「これはより高い」 (Kore wa yori takai - This is more expensive) can imply \"This is more expensive (than other things, implicitly).\" While grammatically valid, this usage is less common for explicit two-item comparisons and is typically clearer when 「のほうが」 is included.",
