    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「ぐらい」 (gurai), meaning \"to the extent of\" or \"about,\" and 「なら」 (nara), meaning \"if that's the case\" or \"if it comes to that.\" The combination creates a sense of preferring an alternative action if the initial situation reaches a certain undesirable extent.",
    "writeup": "「ぐらいなら」 (gurai nara) expresses a preference for one action over another, implying that the first action is undesirable. It's often translated as \"would rather...than\" or \"better off.\" It combines the adverbial particle usages of 「ぐらい」 (gurai), meaning 'about,' and 「なら」 (nara), meaning 'if,' to indicate that 'if it gets to the extent of (A), then (B),' where (B) is the preferable option.\n\n*   「ぐらいなら」 (gurai nara) follows verbs in their dictionary form.\n*   The second half of the sentence often provides a solution, suggestion, or opinion, such as 「ほうがいい」 (hō ga ii - would be better to) or 「ほうがましだ」 (hō ga mashi da - would be less bad).\n*   Sometimes, the sentence implies that (A) has already happened, and the speaker wishes it hadn't. In such cases, 「ぐらいなら」 (gurai nara) translates to \"if I had known that (A), then I would have (B).\"",
