etymology: '心配 (しんぱい) is a compound noun from Chinese characters: 心 (しん - kokoro) meaning "heart, mind,
  spirit," and 配 (ぱい - kubaru) meaning "to distribute, to arrange, to be concerned." Literally, it implies
  one''s heart/mind being "distributed" or "scattered" due to concern, leading to the meaning "worry"
  or "anxiety." When combined with する (to do), it forms the verb "to worry."'
writeup: '`心配する` (しんぱいする) is a fundamental Japanese verb used to express the act of worrying, being concerned,
  or feeling anxious. It is a する verb, meaning it combines a noun (`心配`) with the verb `する` (to do) to
  form a verb phrase. This structure allows `心配` to also function as a noun, meaning "worry" or "concern,"
  often seen in phrases like `心配事` (shinpai-goto, "a worry/concern"). The range of emotions expressed
  by `心配する` can vary from mild apprehension to deep distress. It is commonly used when expressing concern
  for someone''s well-being, anxiety about an uncertain future event, or unease regarding a situation.
  When specifying what one is worried *about*, `心配する` often takes the particle `を` or `について`. For example,
  `試験を心配する` means "to worry about the exam," and `家族について心配する` means "to worry about one''s family." It
  can also take a plain form clause followed by `か` or `かどうか` to express worry about a possibility, such
  as `雨が降るか心配する` (to worry if it will rain). `心配する` primarily focuses on the internal state of the worrier.
  While its basic meaning is straightforward, the context and conjugation will determine the politeness
  and specific nuance. For instance, `心配しないでください` (Please don''t worry) is a very common phrase used to
  comfort someone.'

  - term: 不安
    meaning: anxiety, uneasiness, apprehension
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`不安` is primarily a noun or な-adjective (when combined with だ or です: `不安だ` - "is anxious").
      It describes the *state* of being anxious or uneasy, often more general and less directed than `心配する`.
      While `心配する` is an action of worrying, `不安` is a feeling of unease.'
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:不安 (anxiety・uneasiness)
  - term: 気になる
    meaning: to be on one's mind, to be bothered by, to feel like doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`気になる` expresses that something "comes to mind" or "bothers" you, often implying curiosity,
      slight concern, or a persistent thought. It''s a more passive feeling than `心配する`. You don''t actively
      *do* the "worrying" like with `心配する`; rather, something *becomes* a concern to you. It can also
      mean "to become interested in."'
    grammar_point: 気になる (to be concerned or interested)
  - term: 悩む
    meaning: to be troubled, to be distressed, to agonize
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`悩む` implies a deeper, more prolonged state of mental distress, struggle, or agonizing over
      a problem, often with the implication of seeking a solution. `心配する` is about an *anticipatory* fear
      or concern, whereas `悩む` is about being *presently* tormented by a difficult issue or decision.'
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:悩む (to be troubled・agonize)
post_false_friends_writeup: While `心配する`, `不安`, `気になる`, and `悩む` all relate to states of unease or mental
  discomfort, they differ in their active/passive nature and intensity. `心配する` is the most direct verb
  for "to worry" about something specific. `不安` describes a general state of anxiety. `気になる` means something
  is on your mind, perhaps a minor concern or curiosity. `悩む` suggests a deeper, more persistent struggle
  with a problem, often implying an active search for a solution. Choosing the right term depends on whether
  you are describing an action, a state, a passive feeling, or an ongoing struggle.
