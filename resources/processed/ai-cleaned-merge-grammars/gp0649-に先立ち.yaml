        "nuance": "Carries a more formal and official nuance than simple temporal conjunctions like 「〜前に」, emphasizing the precedence or preparatory nature of the preceding event. It often implies a more structured or planned sequence of events.",
        "source": "Bunpro",
        "colocation": "Often appears with nouns denoting events, ceremonies, or significant actions (e.g., 会議, 発表, 実施). Also used with verbs in dictionary form.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions adverbially, modifying the main clause by specifying the timing or prerequisite condition."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「先(さき)」 (saki, 'ahead') and 「立つ(たつ)」 (tatsu, 'to stand'), literally meaning 'to stand before' or 'to precede'. The 「に」 (ni) indicates direction or purpose, creating the sense of doing something in advance of another event or action. The form 「先立ち」 is the 連用形 (ren'yōkei), or masu-stem, of the verb 「先立つ」, used here in a conjunctive or adverbial capacity, reflecting its formal nature.",
    "writeup": "「に先立ち」 is a formal expression, commonly employed in written Japanese and formal speeches. It signifies that an action or event occurs \"before,\" \"prior to,\" or \"in advance of\" another significant event. The nuance conveyed is that the preceding action serves as a necessary preliminary step or preparation for the subsequent main event.\n\nThis structure connects directly to nouns or to verbs in their dictionary form. The verb 「先立つ」 (sakidatsu) itself means 'to precede' or 'to go before'. While it can appear in its dictionary form 「先立つ」 (as in 「に先立つ」 followed by a noun modifier) or its て-form 「先立って」 (functioning adverbially), the formal conjunctive form 「先立ち」 (which is the 連用形, or masu-stem, of 先立つ) is frequently used in this construction, especially in very formal contexts.\n\nAn important idiomatic usage involves 「先立つもの」. This refers to the 'means' or 'resources' necessary to achieve something, typically money. The phrase 「先立つものがない」 (sakidatsu mono ga nai) is a common expression meaning \"I don't have the necessary means/money (to do something)\". This particular usage is less formal than other applications of 「に先立ち」 but is a fixed expression worth noting.",

            "term": "〜前に",
            "meaning": "before, in front of",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「〜前に」 (mae ni) is a general expression for \"before\" that can refer to both temporal and spatial relationships. It is significantly more casual and broadly applicable than 「に先立ち」, which specifically conveys a formal sense of preceding an event as a preparatory or necessary step."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「に先立ち」 and 「〜前に」 can translate to \"before,\" their usage differs significantly in terms of formality and nuance. Choose 「に先立ち」 when you need to convey a formal, precise sense of one event immediately preceding another as a prerequisite or official announcement. Use 「〜前に」 for everyday, general temporal sequencing. The choice depends on the desired register and the specific relationship between the two events.",
