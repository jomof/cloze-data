    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「先(さき)」 (saki, 'ahead') and 「立つ(たつ)」 (tatsu, 'to stand'), literally meaning 'to stand before' or 'to precede'. The 「に」 (ni) indicates direction or purpose, creating the sense of doing something in advance of another event or action.",
    "writeup": "「に先立ち」 (ni sakidachi) is a formal expression used to indicate that something is done before or in preparation for something else. It connects to nouns and verbs in their dictionary form. It conveys the meaning of \"before,\" \"prior to,\" or \"in advance of.\" The nuance is that the action or event preceding is a necessary step or preparation for the main event. Often used in formal writing, speeches, or announcements.",
