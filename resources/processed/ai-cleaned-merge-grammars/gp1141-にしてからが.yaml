        "Noun + にしてからが": "Indicates that even the person or thing mentioned, who is normally considered to be capable or in a position to do something, is in a certain state or situation."

        "particle-pragmatic-function": "emphasis",
        "function": "Indicates that something unexpected or surprising is true, even of someone or something that you would expect to be different.",

        "colocation": "Often used with nouns representing individuals, groups, or entities that possess a certain authority, reputation, or presumed capability, such as professionals, experts, leaders, or established systems."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にしてからが」 is formed by combining 「～にして」 (meaning 'as' or 'in the capacity of'), 「から」 (meaning 'from' or 'since'), and the particle 「が」 (which marks the subject or introduces a contrast). The combination creates a robust expression meaning 'even as someone/something that...', strongly emphasizing the surprising nature of the situation being described. It carries a nuance of unexpectedness, suggesting that if *this* particular entity is affected or behaving in a certain way, it is especially noteworthy.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「にしてからが」 is employed to highlight a surprising or unexpected situation, indicating that even the most improbable or qualified individual, group, or entity is subject to it. It conveys a strong sense of astonishment or contrast, implying that if the statement holds true for the mentioned subject, it is truly significant. This expression is generally used in formal contexts and carries a weightier nuance of surprise compared to similar phrases like 「でさえ」 or 「ですら」. It particularly emphasizes the surprising fact about the specific subject, often despite their presumed capabilities, status, or usual behavior.",
