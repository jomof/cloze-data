meaning: In the first place; for crying out loud
pronunciation:
  katakana: ダイタイ
  romaji: daitai
formation:
  だいたい + [Statement of fundamental reason/complaint]: Introduces a fundamental reason, a strong complaint,
    or a basic truth that underpins an argument, often with a sense of exasperation.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express frustration, criticism, or to state a fundamental, often obvious, truth
    in an argument or explanation. It implies that the point being made is so basic or self-evident that
    it should be understood or addressed first.
  function: To introduce a foundational premise, a basic truth, or an exasperated complaint, often implying
    that something went wrong from the very beginning or that a point is being missed.
  nuance: Carries a sense of 'first and foremost,' 'for crying out loud,' or 'what it comes down to.'
    It's often used when the speaker is exasperated or making a strong, foundational point, sometimes
    implying that a previous action or premise was flawed from the start. It can convey a slightly accusatory
    or critical tone.
  colocation: Often appears at the beginning of a sentence or clause. Frequently followed by why-questions
    (なぜ, なんで) or statements of basic fact/problem (～ものだ, ～はずだ, ～おかしい).
etymology: 大体 (だいたい) is formed from the kanji 大 (dai), meaning "large" or "great," and 体 (tai), meaning
  "body" or "substance." Together, they suggest the main, essential, or foundational part of something.
  This meaning evolved to encompass the idea of 'in the first place' or 'fundamentally,' as one addresses
  the 'main body' or 'core' of an issue before anything else. It highlights the primary, underlying point.
writeup: |-
  だいたい (daitai) serves as an adverb that introduces a fundamental reason, a core complaint, or a basic truth. Unlike its other nuance which indicates approximation, this usage of だいたい emphasizes a point that should be considered first or that underpins an entire situation, often with a sense of frustration or exasperation from the speaker.

  It's frequently used to express an opinion about a situation that has gone wrong, or to question the very basis of an argument. When used in this manner, it can convey a tone similar to "for crying out loud," "honestly," or "what it comes down to." It highlights a core issue that, from the speaker's perspective, is so obvious or essential it should have been acknowledged earlier or handled differently.
false_friends:
  - term: そもそも
    meaning: in the first place, to begin with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そもそも」 strictly refers to the origin or fundamental premise of something, often used to challenge
      or question the very basis of a situation, implying it shouldn't have happened or started at all.
      While similar to だいたい in meaning 'in the first place,' だいたい can be used more broadly to introduce
      a fundamental reason or complaint without necessarily challenging the initial premise in the same
      absolute way. だいたい focuses on the core truth or immediate flaw, whereas そもそも questions the genesis
      itself.
    grammar_point: そもそも (in the first place)
  - term: だいたい (approximate)
    meaning: roughly, approximately, mostly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While phonetically identical, this sense of 「だいたい」 refers to estimation or generalization,
      indicating a non-precise amount or state. The grammar point 「だいたい (in the first place)」, however,
      introduces a fundamental reason or an exasperated complaint, focusing on a core underlying truth.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:だいたい (approximate)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「だいたい」 has two primary meanings. One refers to approximation, meaning 'roughly'
  or 'mostly'. The other, as discussed here, introduces a fundamental reason or an exasperated complaint.
  For instance, if you say 「だいたい３０分かかります」 ("It takes roughly 30 minutes"), you are using the approximation
  sense. In contrast, when you say 「だいたい、なぜこんなことになったんだ？」 ("In the first place, why did this happen?"),
  you are using the fundamental reason sense, often with frustration. This distinction is crucial for
  correct usage. Similarly, 「だいたい」 and 「そもそも」 both translate to "in the first place," but their core nuances
  differ. 「そもそも」 is about the origin and challenges the very beginning of something. For instance, if
  you say 「そもそも、そんな計画を立てるべきではなかった」 ("In the first place, you shouldn't have made such a plan"), you're
  criticizing the foundational decision. On the other hand, 「だいたい」, while also introducing a fundamental
  point, often conveys exasperation about a current situation or a general truth, rather than strictly
  focusing on the absolute origin. For example, 「だいたい、そんな言い方はないでしょう？」 ("For crying out loud, you can't
  say that, can you?") expresses a general complaint about manners, not necessarily their origin.
examples:
  - english: In the first place, why did you do such a thing?
    japanese:
      - '{だいたい} なぜ あなた は そんな こと を し た の です か？'
      - '{だいたい} なぜ あなた は そんな こと を し た の？'
      - '{だいたい} なぜ そんな こと を し た の？'
      - '{だいたい} そんな こと を なぜ し た ん だ？'
    english_literally: In the first place, why did you do such a thing?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{そもそも} なぜ あなた は そんな こと を し た の です か？'
        english: Why did you do such a thing to begin with?
        hint: 「そもそも」 strongly questions the fundamental premise or origin, implying the action should
          not have happened at all. We're looking for a slightly broader, exasperated fundamental question.
    scene: A parent scolding their child for a mischievous act.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「なぜ」 combined with 「だいたい」 conveys strong exasperation and a questioning of fundamental
      logic, implying that the action should not have happened at all. The direct question form 「…したのですか？」
      reinforces the scolding tone often used by parents towards children, or between older individuals
      towards younger ones when expressing disappointment or bewilderment.
  - english: In the first place, it's weird to think like that!
    japanese:

          - '{正直}、そんな 風 に 考える の は おかしい よ！'
        english: Honestly, thinking that way is strange!
        hint: 「正直」 emphasizes honesty, but not necessarily a fundamental, exasperated truth. We're looking
          for a strong, basic criticism of a thought process.

post_example_writeup: This usage of だいたい clearly expresses the speaker's frustration or assertion of a
  fundamental truth. It often implies a sense of "why are we even discussing this, the basic fact is..."
  or "I told you so, this is the root of the problem." It's a useful phrase for cutting to the chase and
  stating what the speaker perceives as the indisputable core issue.
