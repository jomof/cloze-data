id: gp9999
meaning: what; how many/much
pronunciation:
  katakana: ナニ・ナン
  romaji: nani・nan
  pronunciation_warning: The pronunciation changes to 「なん」 (nan) before certain sounds (e.g., て-form,
    da-words, counters).
formation:
  何 + particle (e.g., が・を・に・で): What (particle)?
  何 + counter: How many (counter)?
  何 + だ/です: What is it?
  何 + て/と/だ/な sounds (e.g., 何て Nan te, 何と Nanto, 何だ Nanda): The pronunciation becomes 「なん」 to facilitate
    smoother articulation.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The character 何 itself has a complex history. Its ancient forms involved a person carrying
  something, which evolved to signify 'what' or 'why' in terms of an unknown object or reason. The shift
  between 「なに」 and 「なん」 is a phonological phenomenon in Japanese, often occurring to ease pronunciation
  when followed by certain consonants (e.g., 't', 'd', 'n' sounds), a process known as euphony (音便 onbin).
  「なに」 is the older form, 「なん」 is a phonetic alteration that became standard in specific contexts.
writeup: |-
  何 (nani/nan) is one of the most fundamental interrogative pronouns in Japanese, equivalent to "what" in English. Its usage is pervasive across all levels of Japanese communication, from casual conversation to formal writing. The primary challenge for learners is understanding its dual pronunciation: 「なに」 (nani) and 「なん」 (nan).

  Generally, 「なに」 is used when 何 stands alone, is followed by particles like が (ga), を (o), に (ni), へ (e), or serves as the subject or object of a sentence. For example, 「これ は なに です か。」 (Kore wa nani desu ka. - What is this?).

  「なん」 is used in two main scenarios:

  1.  When followed by sounds that are similar to the 'n' sound, such as 't' (た・だ行) or 'd' (だ行) sounds, or certain counters. For instance, 「何 です か。」 (Nan desu ka. - What time is it?) or 「何時 です か。」 (Nan ji desu ka. - What time is it?). This phonetic change makes pronunciation smoother.
  2.  When it precedes a counter, it asks "how many" or "how much" (e.g., 「何人」 Nan nin - How many people?, 「何歳」 Nan sai - How old?).

  Understanding this distinction is crucial for natural pronunciation and comprehension. While the core meaning remains "what," its specific nuance can change based on context and accompanying particles or counters, ranging from a simple inquiry to expressing surprise or confusion.
false_friends:
  - term: 何か
    meaning: something; anything
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「何」 which asks for specific unknown information, 「何か」 refers to an unspecified item
      or idea. It functions as an indefinite pronoun.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:何か (something)
  - term: 何も〜ない
    meaning: nothing; not anything
    kind: antonym
    nuance: This phrase uses 「何」 in combination with 「も」 and a negative verb to express a complete lack
      or absence. It signifies "not anything at all."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:何も〜ない (not at all)
  - term: どう
    meaning: how; in what way
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both are interrogatives, 「どう」 asks about method, manner, or state, whereas 「何」 asks
      about identity or quantity.
    grammar_point: どう (how)
  - term: どんな
    meaning: what kind of; what sort of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どんな」 is an interrogative adjective that asks about the nature or type of something, requiring
      a noun to follow it. 「何」 asks about identity or quantity directly.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どんな (what kind of)
post_false_friends_writeup: It is important to differentiate 何 (nani/nan) from other interrogative words
  that might seem similar. While 何 asks "what" (identifying an unknown thing or quantity), 何か means "something"
  (an unspecified thing). When 何 is followed by も and a negative, as in 何も〜ない, it conveys "nothing at
  all," indicating a complete absence. Furthermore, carefully distinguish 何 from どう (how), which inquires
  about method or state, and どんな (what kind of), which seeks information about the type or nature of a
  noun.
examples:
  - english: What is this?
    japanese:
      - これ は {なに} です か。
      - これ {なに}？
      - これ {なん}？
    english_literally: As for this, what is it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ は {どう} です か。
        english: How is this?
        hint: 「どう」 asks about method or state, not identification. We are looking for a way to ask for
          the identity of an unknown object.
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ は {なん} です か。
        english: What is this?
        hint: While a common mistake, 「なに」 is typically used when followed by the particle 「は」 or 「を」.
          We are looking for the standard pronunciation.
    scene: A person points at an unknown object.
    register: teineigo (polite)

          - '{どんな} もの を 買い まし た か。'
        english: What kind of thing did you buy?

          identity of the purchased item.
    scene: One friend asks another after they return from shopping.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    nuance: Uses 「なに」 because it's followed by the direct object particle 「を」. The polite past tense 「買いました」
      makes the question polite.

          in this context.
    scene: A parent asks their child who is quietly occupied.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: Again, 「なに」 is used with the direct object particle 「を」, despite the verb being in the progressive
      form. This is a common and versatile question.

          is typically used for smoother pronunciation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ {どう} です か。
        english: How is that?

    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: This is a very common casual usage. 「なん」 is used before 「です」 (which begins with a 'd' sound,

          or 'what occurred?'.
    scene: A friend asks after hearing a loud noise.
    register: casual

    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: Demonstrates 「なん」 before 「て」 (the casual form of 「と」, the quotative particle). This is a common
      phonetic change.

    japanese:
      - '{なん} と いう こと だ！'
      - '{なん} と いう こと です か！'
    english_literally: What a thing it is!

      - competing_japanese:
          - '{なに} と いう こと だ！'
        english: What a surprise!
        hint: In exclamatory phrases using 「と いう こと」, 何 is usually pronounced 「なん」. We are looking for
          the standard pronunciation in this expressive phrase.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{どう} いう こと だ！'
        english: What do you mean? / What's the meaning?

          strong emotion.
    scene: Expressing strong surprise or dismay at a situation.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    nuance: 「なん」 is used before 「と」 in exclamatory phrases, conveying strong emotion or surprise. This
      structure emphasizes the extent or nature of something.

    english_literally: As for your name, what is it?
    competing_grammar:

        english: What's your name?
        hint: When directly preceding 「です」 or its casual forms, 何 is typically pronounced 「なん」. We are
          looking for the standard pronunciation in this common phrase.
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 名前 は {どう} です か。
        english: How is your name?
        hint: 「どう」 asks about condition or state, not identification. This would be grammatically awkward
          for asking someone's name. We want to know the name itself.
    scene: A polite inquiry when meeting someone new.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: A classic example where 「なん」 is used before 「です」. This is a very common phrase for introducing
      oneself, illustrating the standard polite usage.
  - english: What kind of plan?
    japanese:
      - '{なん} の 計画 です か。'
      - '{なん} の 計画？'
    english_literally: What plan is it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{なに} の 計画 です か。'
        english: What kind of plan?
        hint: When 何 is followed by 「の」, it is typically pronounced 「なん」, especially when modifying a
          noun. We are looking for the correct pronunciation here.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{どんな} 計画 です か。'
        english: What kind of plan?
        hint: While 「どんな」 is a valid alternative, 「なんの」 is also used to ask for specification about a
          noun, sometimes with a slightly broader nuance than 'type'.
    scene: A team member asks their leader about the next steps.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    nuance: Uses 「なん」 before 「の」 which modifies a noun 「計画」 (plan). This is a common way to ask "what
      (kind of) noun" without using どんな.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, correctly choosing between 「なに」 and 「なん」 depends
  heavily on the phonetic environment or the type of noun/counter that follows. Pay close attention to
  these patterns to ensure natural and accurate communication.
