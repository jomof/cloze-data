details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: General use, applicable in various contexts, from casual to formal.
  function: Connects a preceding clause (a reason) to a subsequent one (a suggestion, invitation, or determination),
    implying that the stated reason is sufficient among other unmentioned reasons.
  nuance: Emphasizes that the stated reason is not the sole factor, but it is enough to warrant the following
    action or conclusion. It subtly suggests a broader context of motivations or factors contributing
    to the situation.
  grammatical-role: Conjunctive phrase
etymology: The grammar point 「ことだし」 is derived from 「こと」 (thing, matter, fact), 「だ」 (copula), and 「し」
  (a conjunctive particle used to list reasons). The 「こと」 nominalizes the preceding phrase, 「だ」 asserts
  it, and 「し」 adds the nuance that this is one of several reasons, implying that the stated reason is
  one among a broader set of contributing factors.
writeup: 「ことだし」 combines the noun 「こと」 ('thing'), the auxiliary verb 「だ」, and the conjunctive particle
  「し」. It is employed to articulate reasons, often translating simply as "because (A)" or "since (A),"
  but critically, it emphasizes that there are other unstated reasons contributing to the situation. This
  structure can follow verbs or adjectives in their plain forms, or nouns followed by 「の」 or 「である」. Similar
  to the standard usage of 「し」 in listing, this grammar point indicates that the stated reason (A) is
  not the sole factor. The implication is that while other reasons exist, reason (A) alone is sufficient
  to justify action (B). Action (B) typically takes the form of a suggestion, an invitation, or an expression
  of firm determination. It can be used across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal
  settings, adapting its nuance based on the context and preceding word.
false_friends:
  - term: ～から
    meaning: Because, since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「から」 states a direct cause-and-effect relationship without implying other reasons. It's a
      simple, straightforward explanation.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]〜から (because・so)'
  - term: ～ので
    meaning: Because, since (polite)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ので」 also states a direct cause-and-effect, often sounding softer and more polite than 「から」.
      It doesn't imply additional reasons beyond the stated one.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]〜から (because・so)'
  - term: ～のことだから
    meaning: Knowing X, because it's X (implying X's characteristic behavior)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While similar in conveying "knowing X", 「～のことだから」 implies a direct causal link between X's
      known characteristic and the outcome. In contrast, 「ことだし」 suggests X's characteristic is one of
      many reasons leading to the outcome, feeling less definitive about the causal chain.
    grammar_point: ことだから (given the nature of)
  - term: ものだから
    meaning: Because, the reason is...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ものだから」 is typically used when providing an excuse or a strong reason, often implying a personal
      or unavoidable circumstance. Unlike 「ことだし」, it doesn't necessarily imply other unstated reasons,
      but rather that the stated reason is the definitive one for the speaker's action or situation.
    grammar_point: もので・ものだから (because・as an excuse)
  - term: ことから
    meaning: From the fact that; because; due to; given that.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ことから」 focuses on deriving a conclusion or understanding from a specific fact or observation.
      While it indicates a reason, it emphasizes the factual basis rather than implying other contributing
      factors as 「ことだし」 does. It often explains why something is understood in a certain way.
    grammar_point: ことから (from the fact that)
  - term: それに
    meaning: And, Besides, Moreover, In addition
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「それに」 explicitly adds another reason or piece of information to what has already been stated.
      While 「ことだし」 implies additional unstated reasons, 「それに」 requires them to be stated sequentially.
      「ことだし」 allows for a single stated reason to be sufficient while hinting at more; 「それに」 requires
      listing each reason.
    grammar_point: それに (in addition)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ことだし」 shares meaning with other causal conjunctions like 「から」 and 「ので」,
  its core nuance lies in implying that the stated reason is one among several unmentioned reasons. 「から」
  and 「ので」 typically present a single, direct cause for an action or conclusion. Similarly, 「～のことだから」,
  while indicating an expectation based on someone's known character, focuses on that specific characteristic
  as the direct cause. In contrast, 「ことだし」 subtly suggests a broader context of motivations or factors
  contributing to the situation, making it suitable for gentle suggestions or when providing a sufficient,
  but not exhaustive, justification.

        english: Because the last train is gone, why don't we stay here tonight?
        hint: The situation implies there might be other reasons to stay, like continued conversation
          or comfort, which 「ことだし」 subtly suggests. 「から」 would state only the train's absence as the reason.
          We're looking for a softer suggestion that hints at multiple factors.

        english: Because the new project has just started and is difficult, let's all work together to
          get through it.
        hint: 「ことだし」 is used here to imply that the project's newness and difficulty are among several
          factors encouraging teamwork, perhaps including team spirit or high expectations. 「から」 simply
          states these as the direct and sole reasons. We need a way to express that there are multiple
          underlying reasons for the suggestion.

        english: Because today is very calm, why don't we drink tea in the garden?
        hint: 「ことだし」 implies the calm weather is one of several gentle reasons for having tea in the garden,
          such as the beauty of the setting or a desire for quiet reflection. 「から」 would present the calm
          day as the only reason. We are looking for a suggestion that hints at additional, unspoken considerations.

    nuance: The use of 「～ません か」 for a polite suggestion is suitable for an older speaker. 「ことだし」 here
      implies a gentle, relaxed atmosphere, which an older person might appreciate and highlight as one
      of several reasons for the suggestion.

        english: Because it's her usual self, I'm sure she'll deliver a perfect presentation this time
          too.
        hint: 「ことだし」 suggests that her consistent behavior is one of many factors contributing to the
          speaker's confidence, perhaps including past successes or her dedication. 「～のことだから」 explicitly
          links the outcome to her character. We need an expression that broadens the scope of reasons
          for the speaker's certainty.

        hint: 「ことだし」 implies that the upcoming tests are a primary reason, but there might be other underlying
          motivations for studying hard, such as personal ambition or peer influence. 「から」 would present
          the tests as the sole reason. The nuance we seek suggests multiple contributing factors.

        hint: 「ことだし」 subtly implies that everyone waiting is a significant reason, but perhaps other unspoken
          reasons like the scheduled time or consideration for others also contribute to the suggestion
          to leave. 「から」 would just state the waiting as the direct cause. We're looking for a suggestion
          that takes into account broader considerations.

        hint: 「ことだし」 suggests the greeting's conclusion is a key signal, but also implies other reasons
          for starting, such as the schedule or the guests' readiness, contributing to the decision. 「から」
          would simply state the end of the greeting as the direct trigger. We need a way to convey that

          like the need to prioritize information or simplify for the audience, also influencing the decision
          to explain briefly. 「から」 would state time constraint as the sole reason. We are looking for

        english: Because it's Taro, who is such a hard worker, he'll surely pass, wonen't he?
        hint: 「ことだし」 implies that Taro's diligence is a strong factor, but also suggests other reasons
          for confidence in his passing, such as his intelligence or thorough preparation. 「～のことだから」 emphasizes
          his inherent character as the direct cause. We need an expression that allows for multiple factors
          contributing to the speaker's certainty.
    scene: Two friends are discussing their diligent friend Taro's upcoming exam results.

    nuance: The casual tone and use of 「君」 for Taro-kun indicates a close, friendly relationship. The
      sentence-final particle 「ね」 softens the assertion and seeks agreement, common in casual conversation

        english: Because this is an official request, please double-check the documents.
        hint: 「ことだし」 implies that its official nature is a primary reason, but there might be other reasons
          for the meticulous check, such as the importance of the task itself or the need to avoid mistakes
          in a formal setting. 「ので」 presents the official request as the sole and direct reason. We are
          looking for an expression that hints at broader underlying motivations for being careful.
    scene: A senior colleague instructs a junior colleague about handling important paperwork.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of 「である」 before 「ことだし」 adds a formal and objective tone, suitable for a professional
      setting when discussing official matters. 「確認 し て ください」 is a polite request, emphasizing the gravity
      of the instruction. This construction implies that the official nature of the request, along with
      perhaps unstated considerations like legal implications or company policy, necessitates extra caution.

        hint: 「ことだし」 implies that its interesting nature is one of several reasons to buy it, perhaps
          including its author, a sale, or recommendations. 「から」 would state the interesting nature as
          the sole reason. We are looking for a decision influenced by broader, potentially unstated,
          factors.
    scene: A person browsing in a bookstore finds a captivating book.

    setting: reflective
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated by these examples, 「ことだし」 is a versatile expression that allows
  for a nuanced explanation of reasons. It subtly communicates that while the stated reason is sufficient,
  there are other contributing factors at play, making it a natural choice for polite suggestions, considerate
  explanations, or when implying a broader context for an action or decision.
