    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てある」 is a combination of the te-form of a verb and the verb 「ある」 (aru), meaning \"to exist\" or \"to be\". The te-form indicates a completed action, and 「ある」 signifies the resulting state of that action. This construction emphasizes the continued existence of the result of a purposeful action.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てある」 describes a **state** that is the result of a prior action. It is crucial to understand that it is used **only with transitive verbs** and places emphasis on the **object** that has been acted upon, rather than the person or entity who performed the action. The use of 「ある」 (aru) signifies the continued existence of this state, implying that the object is inanimate or cannot undo the action.\n\nWhile often translated simply as \"something has been done\" or \"something is in a state of having been done,\" 「てある」 frequently carries the nuance that the action was performed with a **purpose** or in **preparation** for something else.\n\nWhen using 「てある」, the object of the verb becomes the grammatical subject of the resulting state, and therefore takes the particle 「が」. For example, when you say 「ドアが閉めてある」 (doa ga shimete aru, the door is closed/has been closed), you are emphasizing the state of the door as a result of someone's intentional act of closing it, often for a reason (e.g., to keep out the cold).",
