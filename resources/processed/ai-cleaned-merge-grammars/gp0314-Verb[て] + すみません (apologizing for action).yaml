jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: Expresses apology or regret for an action.
  nuance: Specifically indicates that the preceding action (expressed in te-form) or situation/state (expressed
    with で) is the cause or reason for the apology. It implies a sense of responsibility for the consequence
    or inconvenience caused.
etymology: The grammar point 「てすみません」 comes from the combination of the te-form 「て」, which indicates a
  reason or cause, and 「すみません」, meaning "I'm sorry". 「すみません」 itself comes from the verb 「済む」 (sumu), meaning
  "to finish" or "to settle". So, literally, 「てすみません」 implies that something is not yet settled or resolved
  due to the preceding action, and the speaker is expressing regret for that situation. This can be likened
  to the English idiom of 'having unfinished business' or 'things not being settled right' because of
  something one did.
writeup: 「てすみません」 is a grammar construction used to express regret or apology for something. It can be
  translated as "I'm sorry for [doing something]" or "I'm sorry for [a situation]". The preceding te-form
  of a verb or a noun/な-adjective stem followed by 「で」 indicates the specific reason, action, or state
  that is the cause for the apology, while 「すみません」 expresses the apology itself. This construction implies
  that the preceding element has led to an unresolved, inconvenient, or uncomfortable issue for which
  the speaker feels responsible. While it directly translates to "I'm sorry," it is more precise to understand
  it as highlighting the speaker's regret or lingering feelings about a particular action or situation,
  conveying that sense of 'unfinished business' or 'being unsettled' to the person being apologized to.
  This nuance makes it a more direct and cause-oriented apology compared to general apologies like 「ごめんなさい」.

  - term: ごめんなさい
    meaning: I'm sorry
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ごめんなさい」 is a more direct and general apology. 「てすみません」 is used for apologizing for a specific
      action or its consequences, implying that the action is the cause of the inconvenience or regret.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ごめんなさい (general apology)
  - term: 申し訳ありません
    meaning: I am very sorry
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「申し訳ありません」 is a more formal and serious apology, often used in business or deeply regrettable
      situations. 「てすみません」 is less formal and more commonly used in everyday situations for specific actions,
      implying that the action is the cause of the inconvenience or regret.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:申し訳ありません (formal apology)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ごめんなさい」 is a general "I'm sorry" and 「申し訳ありません」 is a more formal apology,
  「てすみません」 specifically addresses regret for an action or its result. Choose 「てすみません」 when you want to
  express remorse for something you've done that caused inconvenience or trouble, specifically pointing
  to the action as the reason for your apology.
