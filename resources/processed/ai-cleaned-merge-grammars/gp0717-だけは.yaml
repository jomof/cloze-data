    "etymology": "The word 「だけ」 is said to originate from the verb 「具わる (sonawaru)」, meaning \"to be fully equipped/provided\". From this, it came to mean \"the entire extent possible\" or \"all that one can\". The particle 「は」 serves as a topic marker, emphasizing the aspect of \"to the fullest extent possible\".",
    "writeup": "だけは is a grammar pattern that incorporates the particle だけ, meaning 'just' or 'only'. In this specific structure, だけ combines with は, indicating that a particular verbal action has been performed 'to the fullest extent possible' or 'as much as one can'.\n\nTypically, the same verb is repeated both before and after だけは. The verb appearing after だけは usually takes its past-tense (〜た) or progressive (〜ている) form. For instance, if the verb is 食べる (to eat), 食べるだけは食べた translates to 'I ate just what I could eat' or 'I ate to the fullest extent I was able to.' As this pattern frequently discusses possibilities or capacities, the verb preceding だけは often in its potential form (〜れる / 〜られる).\n\nAn important nuance: When used with a verbal noun (e.g., 勉強 'study', 連絡 'contact') that typically pairs with the verb する, the する can be omitted before だけは but must appear after it. For example, 勉強 {だけは} したが (I studied as much as I could, but...) or 連絡 {だけは} しているが (I've contacted as much as I could, but...). In such cases, the verbal noun itself is not repeated after だけは.",
