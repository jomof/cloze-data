    "writeup": "だけは is a grammar pattern that includes the particle だけ, meaning \"just\" or \"only.\" In this structure, だけ pairs with は to indicate that a specific verb is being done \"as much as one can.\" The same verb is typically repeated both before and after だけは, with the second instance often appearing in its past-tense or ている form.\n\nFor example, if the verb is 食べる (to eat), 食べるだけは食べた would mean \"I ate just what I could eat.\" Because this pattern frequently discusses possibilities, the first verb is often in the potential れる or られる form. Also, it's common to see する omitted following the first verb, only being used after だけは. In such cases, the target verb itself will not usually be repeated after だけは.",
    "etymology": "だけ comes from the verb zu (備わる) meaning 'to be equipped with', so the sense of 'all that something is equipped with' became 'as much as can be'. は is a topic marker, emphasizing the 'as much as possible' aspect.",
