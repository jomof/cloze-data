        "usage-context": "Used to emphasize the maximum extent of an action or state, often implying a contrasting or unexpected outcome.",
        "function": "Indicates an action or state has been performed or achieved to its fullest extent, often with an implied contrast or limitation regarding the outcome or other aspects.",
        "nuance": "Carries a nuance of 'only this much' or 'this was done, but...', emphasizing that while the action itself was completed to its maximum, the expected positive result might not have been achieved, or there were other limitations. The は particle adds a contrastive emphasis.",
        "source": "general Japanese usage",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as an adverbial phrase, modifying the subsequent verb."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「だけ」 is said to originate from the verb 「具わる (sonawaru)」, meaning \"to be fully equipped/provided\". From this, it came to mean \"the entire extent possible\" or \"all that one can\". The particle 「は」 serves as a topic marker, emphasizing the aspect of \"to the fullest extent possible\" and often adding a contrastive nuance.",
    "writeup": "「だけは」 is a grammar pattern that incorporates the particle だけ, meaning 'just' or 'only', combined with the topic particle は. In this specific structure, だけは indicates that a particular verbal action has been performed 'to the fullest extent possible' or 'as much as one can'.\n\nTypically, the same verb is repeated both before and after だけは. The verb appearing after だけは usually takes its past-tense (〜た) or progressive (〜ている) form. For instance, if the verb is 食べる (to eat), 食べるだけは食べた translates to 'I ate just what I could eat' or 'I ate to the fullest extent I was able to.' As this pattern frequently discusses possibilities or capacities, the verb preceding だけは often appears in its potential form (〜れる / 〜られる).\n\nAn important nuance: When used with a verbal noun (e.g., 勉強 'study', 連絡 'contact') that typically pairs with the verb する, the する can be omitted before だけは but must appear after it. For example, 勉強 {だけは} したが (I studied as much as I could, but...) or 連絡 {だけは} しているが (I've contacted as much as I could, but...). In such cases, the verbal noun itself is not repeated after だけは. This construction places emphasis on the action itself, often setting up a contrast with a subsequent negative or less-than-ideal outcome.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike {だけは} which often carries a nuance of \"doing *only* this much, or this much *despite* limitations/with contrasting results,\" 「〜限り」 more generally means \"to the extent that...\" or \"as long as,\" without the strong implied contrast or sense of insufficiency."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「〜だけは〜」 and 「〜限り」 are used to express the extent or limit of an action, their nuances differ. 「〜だけは〜」 often carries a sense of having done something to the maximum possible extent, yet with an implication that the expected outcome wasn't achieved, or that this was the only thing that could be done. In contrast, 「〜限り」 is generally more neutral, simply stating that an action is performed within a certain condition or limit. Understanding this distinction allows for more precise expression.",

This could mean that the outcome of the action was insufficient, disappointing, or that the action itself was the only thing that could be fully accomplished. It is frequently used when there is a discernible gap between the completion of an action and its subsequent circumstances or the speaker's feelings.",
