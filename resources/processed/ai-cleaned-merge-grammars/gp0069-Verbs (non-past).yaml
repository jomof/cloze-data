        "function": "To express general truths, habitual actions, or future events.",
        "nuance": "The non-past verb form is highly versatile. Its precise temporal meaning (present habit/truth or future) is determined by context, temporal adverbs, or sentence-final particles. Without specific time markers, it typically implies a general truth. In narrative contexts, it can also describe events happening 'in the moment' if the context is clear.",
        "grammatical-role": "base form",
        "logical-flow": "Describes actions or states that occur without a specific temporal constraint, allowing for general statements or future projections.",
        "temporal-flow": "Flexible; can indicate present habit, general truth, or future event depending on context and adverbs.",
        "spatial-flow": "Implies movement or location associated with the verb, if applicable, in non-past contexts. For instance, 行く (to go) implies movement from one point to another without specifying a destination, but setting up a future action, or a habitual one. In such cases, the non-past form indicates direction rather than current location. The base form is always present, and cannot be changed by conjugation to show directionality. The particle associated with the verb will handle that: へ or に or で. As in: 図書館 へ 行く (going to the library). The non-past verb describes the general notion of 'going' rather than the specific instance of 'currently going')."
    },
    "etymology": "The non-past form, also known as the dictionary form 「辞書形 (じしょけい)」, is the base form of the verb. It's the form you'll find in dictionaries. It serves as the foundation for many other conjugations and grammatical structures.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, the non-past form of verbs is the same as the dictionary form. Unlike English, this form covers several cases where English would require different conjugations. These include verbs ending with '-s' (sees, hears, goes), verbs requiring 'will' (will see, will hear, will go), and verbs that don't require conjugation (see, hear, go).\n\nBecause the non-past form covers several nuances, it's important to use expressions of time to clarify the meaning. Without a time word, the nuance becomes a general fact that is true at any time.\n\nThe non-past form can express general facts, habits, or future events.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   In books, the non-past form may be used for events happening 'in the moment,' but the context will usually make this clear.",
