    "etymology": "The non-past form of a verb is the same as its dictionary form. It originates from the verb's basic, unconjugated state, reflecting its potential for action or being.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, the non-past form of verbs is identical to the dictionary form/casual form. Unlike English, this form can be used in several cases where conjugation or different constructions would be required in English.\n\nWe can see that the single non-past form of Japanese verbs covers three forms of English verbs: verbs ending with -s (sees, hears, goes), verbs requiring \"will\" (will see, will hear, will go), and verbs that do not require conjugation (see, hear, go).\n\nBecause this one form of verbs covers several different nuances, it is often important to use expressions of time in the sentence, so that the meaning becomes clear. If there is no word distinguishing \"time\" in the sentence, the nuance will be that of stating a general fact about something that is true at any time.\n\nFrom all of these examples, we can see that the non-past form can be thought of as expressing one of three basic ideas: general facts, habits, or future events.\n\n**Important Consideration**\nIn books, the non-past form will regularly be used for events that are happening \"in the moment\", but without any time word being used. In these cases, it is usually obvious from context that it is happening then and there.",
