For instance, 行く (to go) implies movement from one point to another without specifying a destination, but setting up a future action, or a habitual one. In such cases, the non-past form indicates direction rather than current location. The base form is always present, and cannot be changed by conjugation to show directionality. The particle associated with the verb will handle that: へ or に or で. As in: 図書館 へ 行く (going to the library). The non-past verb describes the general notion of 'going' rather than the specific instance of 'currently going')."

    "etymology": "The non-past form, also known as the dictionary form 「辞書形 (じしょけい)」, is the base form of the verb. It's the form you'll find in dictionaries. It serves as the foundation for many other conjugations and grammatical structures.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, the non-past form of verbs is the same as the dictionary form. Unlike English, this form covers several cases where English would require different conjugations. These include verbs ending with '-s' (sees, hears, goes), verbs requiring 'will' (will see, will hear, will go), and verbs that don't require conjugation (see, hear, go).\n\nBecause the non-past form covers several nuances, it's important to use expressions of time to clarify the meaning. Without a time word, the nuance becomes a general fact that is true at any time.\n\nThe non-past form can express general facts, habits, or future events.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   In books, the non-past form may be used for events happening 'in the moment,' but the context will usually make this clear.",

Furthermore, if you wish to express a strong intention or plan for a future action, the structure 「～つもり」 (e.g., 「食べる つもり」) should be used, as the non-past verb alone may only imply a general future event without strong personal volition.
