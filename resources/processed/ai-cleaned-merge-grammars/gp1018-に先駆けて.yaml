    "etymology": "「に先駆けて」is derived from the verb 「先駆ける(さきがける)」, meaning \"to go ahead of others\" or \"to pioneer\". It combines the particle 「に」 with the te-form of 「先駆ける」. This grammatical structure emphasizes the idea of doing something before others or leading the way.",
    "writeup": "「に先駆けて」 is used after a noun to express that something is done **ahead of** or in a way that **paves the way for** that noun. It implies that the action taken is a first step, often leading to similar actions by others. Common translations include \"prior to (A), (B)\" or \"ahead of (A), (B)\". It often appears with words like 「世界(せかい)」 (the world), 「全国(ぜんこく)」 (the whole country), 「業界(ぎょうかい)」 (the industry), or 「他社(たしゃ)」 (other companies).",
