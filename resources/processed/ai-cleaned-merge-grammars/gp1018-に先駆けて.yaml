        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "Indicates that an action or entity is a pioneer or forerunner, setting a precedent or being the first to achieve something significant, often influencing subsequent actions by others.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes the act of leading, innovating, or being significantly ahead of others, not merely chronologically prior. It often carries a positive connotation of foresight or groundbreaking achievement.",
        "source": "Derived from the verb 先駆ける (さきがける)."
    },
    "etymology": "「に先駆けて」is derived from the verb 「先駆ける (さきがける)」, meaning \"to go ahead of others\" or \"to pioneer\". It combines the particle 「に」 with the te-form of 「先駆ける」. This grammatical structure emphasizes the idea of doing something before others or leading the way.",
    "writeup": "「に先駆けて」 is a grammar point used to express that something is done **ahead of** or in a way that **paves the way for** a noun or a group. It implies that the action taken is a significant first step, often leading to similar actions by others in the same category. Common translations include \"prior to (A), (B)\" or \"ahead of (A), (B)\". This expression often appears with nouns such as 「世界 (せかい)」 (the world), 「全国 (ぜんこく)」 (the whole country), 「業界 (ぎょうかい)」 (the industry), or 「他社 (たしゃ)」 (other companies), indicating that the subject was a pioneer. Note that the form 「に先駆け (にさきがけ)」 (without the final 「て」) is also very common and carries the same meaning, often used as a direct adverbial phrase or as a noun-like expression.",

                    "mitigation": "While 「市場より早く」 conveys chronological speed, it lacks the implication of setting a new standard or direction for the market. The scene highlights active leadership and trend-setting, making 「に先駆ける」 more appropriate."
