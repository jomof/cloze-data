    "etymology": "「に先駆けて」is derived from the verb 「先駆ける(さきがける)」, meaning \"to go ahead of others\" or \"to pioneer\". It combines the particle 「に」 with the te-form of 「先駆ける」. This grammatical structure emphasizes the idea of doing something before others or leading the way.",
    "writeup": "「に先駆けて」 is a grammar point used to express that something is done **ahead of** or in a way that **paves the way for** a noun or a group. It implies that the action taken is a significant first step, often leading to similar actions by others in the same category. Common translations include \"prior to (A), (B)\" or \"ahead of (A), (B)\". This expression often appears with nouns such as 「世界(せかい)」 (the world), 「全国(ぜんこく)」 (the whole country), 「業界(ぎょうかい)」 (the industry), or 「他社(たしゃ)」 (other companies), indicating that the subject was a pioneer. Note that the form 「に先駆け」 (without the final 「て」) is also very common and carries the same meaning, often used as a direct adverbial phrase or as a noun-like expression.",
