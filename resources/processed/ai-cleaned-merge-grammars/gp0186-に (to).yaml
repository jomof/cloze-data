    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 is believed to have originated from the verb 「あり」 (ari, to exist) and originally indicated location or existence. Over time, it expanded to indicate direction and purpose, eventually becoming an indirect object marker.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」 primarily functions to indicate the **indirect object** of a verb. It specifies the recipient of an action, often translated as \"to\" or \"for\" in English. It's used with transitive verbs that involve a transfer of something, whether it's a physical object, information, or an action. This 「に」 is often used with verbs such as 「あげる」(to give), 「話す」(to speak), 「くれる」(to give (to me)), 「見せる」(to show), 「教える」(to teach), and 「やる」(to give (to inferiors)).",
