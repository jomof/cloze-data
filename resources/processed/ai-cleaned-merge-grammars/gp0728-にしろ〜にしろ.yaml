    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「にしろ」 is formed from the particle 「に」 and 「しろ」, which is the imperative form of the verb 「する」 (to do). Historically, 「する」's imperative form 「せよ」 (or 「しろ」) could function to concede a point, similar to 'let it be so' or 'granted that'. Thus, 「にしろ〜にしろ」 conveys 'granted it is A, granted it is B, the outcome is the same.' The form 「にせよ」 is a more formal variant of 「にしろ」, originating from the same imperative.",
    "writeup": "「にしろ〜にしろ」 is a grammatical structure used to express that a certain condition or situation does not affect the overall result or truth. It is often translated as \"whether... or...\" in English, emphasizing that **regardless of the alternatives presented, the main point remains valid**.\n\nThe structure involves repeating 「にしろ」 after two contrasting possibilities. These possibilities can be verbs, i-adjectives, na-adjectives, or nouns, and they should typically appear in their standard dictionary or plain forms.\n\nWhile grammatically permissible to mix 「にしろ」 and 「にせよ」, it is generally considered unnatural. Therefore, when using this pattern, it is important to consistently use either 「にしろ〜にしろ」 or 「にせよ〜にせよ」.\n\nWhen repeated as 「にしろ〜にしろ」, the phrase illustrates that regardless of either '(A) or (B), (C) is still true'. Often, (A) and (B) represent just a small sample of possibilities, with the broader implication being 'in (A), (B), or any similar situation at all, (C) holds true'. This pattern is frequently used with pairs of antonyms, effectively stating that 'for both extremes (A) and (B), and everything in between, (C) holds true'.\n\nDespite its origin from the imperative form of 「する」, the nuance here is not a command but rather a strong assertion that the specific condition of (A) or (B) is unimportant to the overall statement.",
