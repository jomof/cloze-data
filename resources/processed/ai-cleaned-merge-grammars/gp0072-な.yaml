        "function": "To issue a direct and forceful prohibition.",
        "nuance": "Strong, direct, and sometimes harsh. Can be softened with the addition of 「よ」. Often used by speakers with higher status or among peers, or in moments of strong emotion.",
        "source": "Bunpro, Dictionary of Japanese Grammar",
        "colocation": "Directly follows the dictionary form of verbs.",
        "grammatical-role": "Sentence-ending particle, functions as an imperative marker.",
        "temporal-flow": "Refers to a prohibition of an action in the immediate or near future."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「な」 is believed to have originated from the older negative imperative form 「な～そ」. Over time, the 「そ」 was dropped, leaving just 「な」 as the prohibitive.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「な」 attaches directly to the dictionary form of a verb to express a strong, direct prohibition, akin to saying \"Don't!\" or \"Do not!\". It conveys a forceful command to prevent an action.\n\nHistorically, this usage stems from older negative imperative forms. Due to its directness, 「な」 is typically used in casual, informal speech. It is more commonly employed by male speakers, particularly when addressing individuals of equal or lower status. However, in highly emotional or urgent situations, it can be used by anyone, regardless of gender.\n\nTherefore, it is important to exercise caution when using 「な」, as it can sound harsh or impolite if directed towards superiors or in formal settings.\n\nTo soften the intensity of the prohibition, the particle 「よ」 can be appended to 「な」, forming 「～なよ」. This mitigates the directness, making the expression sound more like a warning, advice, or a gentle plea rather than an outright command. For example, 「するなよ」 (Don't do it, okay?) is softer than 「するな」 (Don't do it!).",
