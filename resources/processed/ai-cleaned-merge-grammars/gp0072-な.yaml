        "usage-context": "Used to issue direct and strong prohibitions, often in informal settings, typically by male speakers or in situations demanding immediate, forceful injunctions. Can also be used by any speaker in highly emotional contexts.",
        "function": "To convey a forceful negative command or prohibition.",
        "nuance": "Direct, strong, and sometimes harsh. Its intensity depends on context and speaker-listener relationship. Can be softened by adding 「よ」 (e.g., 「～なよ」).",

        "colocation": "Directly follows the dictionary form of verbs. Does not attach to nouns or adjectives.",

        "temporal-flow": "Refers to a prohibition of an action starting immediately or in the future."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「な」 is believed to have originated from the older negative imperative form 「な～そ」. Over time, the 「そ」 was dropped, leaving just 「な」 as the prohibitive form. This linguistic evolution highlights its historical role as a direct and forceful command.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「な」 attaches directly to the dictionary form of a verb to express a strong, direct prohibition, equivalent to saying \"Don't!\" or \"Do not!\". It conveys a forceful command to prevent an action.\n\nDue to its directness, 「な」 is primarily used in casual, informal speech. Traditionally, it is more commonly employed by male speakers, particularly when addressing individuals of equal or lower status, or subordinates. However, in highly emotional or urgent situations—such as a sudden warning or outburst of frustration—it can be used by anyone, regardless of gender.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial to use 「な」 with caution, as it can sound harsh, impolite, or even rude if directed towards superiors, strangers, or in formal settings. It lacks the politeness and deference found in other prohibitive expressions.\n\nTo soften the intensity of the prohibition, the particle 「よ」 can be appended, forming 「～なよ」. This mitigates the directness, transforming the expression into more of a warning, advice, or a gentle plea rather than an outright command. For example, 「するなよ」 (Don't do it, okay?) is significantly milder than 「するな」 (Don't do it!). This distinction is vital for proper communication.",
