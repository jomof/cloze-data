    "etymology": "どれ is part of the こそあど (kosoado) series of pronouns in Japanese. It shares a root with これ (this), それ (that), and あれ (that over there). The 'ど' (do) prefix indicates a question or uncertainty, distinguishing it from the demonstrative function of the other pronouns.",
    "writeup": "どれ is part of the *kosoado kotoba* (こそあど言葉) family, which includes words like *kore* (これ), *sore* (それ), and *are* (あれ). These words are used to point at specific things.  Words starting with *do* (ど) are designed for enquiring about something unknown. どれ translates to \"which\" in English and is used when choosing from a group of three or more items. The particle が is often used with どれ, especially when asking questions. However, は is used when どれ follows a noun. When there are only two options, どちら or どっち is used instead of どれ.",
