    "etymology": "「をものともせず」 is derived from 「物(もの)」 (thing), 「とも」 (even), and 「せず」 (without doing). The phrase essentially means 'without making something a thing' or 'without considering something an obstacle'. It emphasizes overcoming difficulties or challenges.",
    "writeup": "「をものともせず」は、不利な状況にもかかわらず、誰かが勇敢に、あるいは断固として行動する様子を表す、形式的な表現です。この表現は、助詞の「を」、名詞の「物」（こと、もの）、助詞の「とも」（～でさえ）、そして動詞「する」の否定形である「せず」が組み合わさってできています。文字通りには「何かを問題とせずに」という意味であり、ある事柄を行動の妨げや目標達成の阻害要因とは見なさないことを含意します。多くの場合、困難や障害を乗り越える個人の勇気、決意、回復力を称賛する際に用いられます。自身の行動についてこの表現を用いることはありません。",
