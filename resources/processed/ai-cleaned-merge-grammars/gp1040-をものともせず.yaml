    "etymology": "「をものともせず」 is derived from 「物(もの)」 (thing), 「とも」 (even), and 「せず」 (without doing). The phrase essentially means 'without making something a thing' or 'without considering something an obstacle'. It emphasizes overcoming difficulties or challenges.",
    "writeup": "The expression **をものともせず** is a formal phrase used to describe someone acting bravely or resolutely despite adverse circumstances. It is formed by combining the particle **を**, the noun **物** (thing/matter), the particle **とも** (even/even if), and the negative form of the verb **する** (to do), which is **せず**. Literally, it means \"without making something a thing\" or \"without considering something an obstacle.\" It implies that a particular matter is not regarded as an impediment to one's actions or goal achievement. This grammar point is often employed to commend an individual's courage, determination, and resilience in overcoming difficulties or challenges. It is important to note that **をものともせず** is typically *not* used to describe one's own actions; it is reserved for praising the actions of others.",
