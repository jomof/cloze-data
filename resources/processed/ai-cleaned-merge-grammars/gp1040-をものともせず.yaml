    "etymology": "「をものともせず」 is derived from 「物(もの)」 (thing), 「とも」 (even), and 「せず」 (without doing). The phrase essentially means 'without making something a thing' or 'without considering something an obstacle'. It emphasizes overcoming difficulties or challenges.",
    "writeup": "「をものともせず」 is a formal expression used to describe someone who bravely or resolutely acts despite unfavorable circumstances. It combines the particle 「を」, the noun 「物」 (thing), the particle 「とも」 (even), and 「せず」, the negative form of 「する」 (to do). The expression implies that a person doesn't allow something to hinder their actions or deter them from achieving their goal. It is often used to praise someone's courage, determination, or resilience. It is generally not used when speaking about one's own actions.",
