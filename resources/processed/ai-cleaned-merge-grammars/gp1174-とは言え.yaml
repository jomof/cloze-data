    "etymology": "The phrase とは言え is derived from 言う (iu), meaning \"to say.\" The と (to) particle indicates a quotation or condition, and は (wa) marks the topic. The combination implies \"even if it is said that...\" or \"although it is said...\"",
    "writeup": "**とは言え** (to wa ie) is a conjunctive phrase used to express a concession or a contrast. It acknowledges a preceding statement or situation as true, but then introduces a contrasting or qualifying point. It can be translated as \"although,\" \"even though,\" \"that being said,\" \"however,\" or \" nevertheless.\"\n\nThis expression is generally used in more formal writing and speech. While it conveys a similar meaning to simpler conjunctions like けど (kedo) or のに (noni), とは言え carries a stronger nuance of a deliberate, considered concession, often in a context where the speaker wants to maintain a polite or objective tone.\n\nIt can connect a phrase or clause to the main sentence, or it can stand alone as a sentence-initial conjunction, linking two independent sentences. When connecting to a noun or a な-adjective, the copula だ or だった is often omitted before とは言え, especially in more colloquial or smooth speech, although it can be included for emphasis.",
