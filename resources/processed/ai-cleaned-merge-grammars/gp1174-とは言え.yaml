    "etymology": "The phrase 「とは言え」 is derived from the verb 「言う」(iu, to say) combined with the particle 「と」(to, quoting particle), 「は」(wa, topic marker), and the verb 「言え」(ie, the imperative form of 「言う」, here used in an archaic sense). Literally, it means 「とは言うものの」 (to wa iu mono no), which translates to 'although that is said,' or 'even if one says that.' It acknowledges a certain statement while introducing a contrast or qualification.",
    "writeup": "「とは言え」 is used to introduce a contrasting or qualifying statement. It acknowledges the truth of the first statement but introduces a different perspective or limitation. It is similar to \"although,\" \"even though,\" or \"that being said.\" It often appears in formal writing and speech. It is a more nuanced way of expressing contrast than simpler conjunctions like 「でも」 or 「しかし」.",
