    "etymology": "The grammar point までもない is composed of まで (made), meaning 'until' or 'to the extent of,' も (mo), an adverbial particle emphasizing the degree, and ない (nai), meaning 'not.' Literally, it suggests that the situation doesn't even reach the point where the action is necessary.",
    "writeup": "**までもない** (made mo nai) expresses the idea that something is unnecessary or goes without saying. It combines the particle *made* ('until'), the adverbial particle *mo*, and *nai* ('not'). A more literal translation would be 'it is not so far as to (A),' implying that the situation doesn't warrant the action. It follows verbs in their dictionary form. It suggests the speaker feels there is no need to confirm something because it is obvious. The conjunctive form **までもなく** (made mo naku) is used when it comes between two phrases, but it is less common.",
