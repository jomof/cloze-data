    "etymology": "「までもない」 is composed of 「まで」 (made), meaning 'until' or 'to the extent of,' 「も」 (mo), an adverbial particle that adds emphasis, and 「ない」 (nai), meaning 'not' or 'there is not.' Literally, it suggests that something 'doesn't even reach the point' of being necessary.",
    "writeup": "「までもない」 is a grammar pattern indicating that something is **unnecessary** or **needless**. It suggests that the situation doesn't warrant a particular action or that something is so obvious that it doesn't require mentioning. It follows verbs in their dictionary form. The particle 「も」 adds emphasis to the lack of necessity. While 「までもなくて」 is also used, 「までもなく」 is more common as a conjunctive form, typically used when followed by a phrase explaining why the action is unnecessary. This grammar point is widely used across various registers and age groups, with no particular gender or regional restrictions.",
