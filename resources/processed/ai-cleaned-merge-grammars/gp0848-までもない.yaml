    "etymology": "「までもない」 is composed of 「まで」 (made), meaning 'until' or 'to the extent of,' 「も」 (mo), an adverbial particle that adds emphasis, and 「ない」 (nai), meaning 'not' or 'there is not.' Literally, it suggests that something 'doesn't even reach the point' of being necessary. The usage evolved to express the futility or obviousness of performing an action.",
    "writeup": "「までもない」 is a versatile grammar pattern used to express that a certain action or consideration is **unnecessary**, **needless**, or **goes without saying**. It follows verbs in their dictionary form. The core nuance conveyed by 「までもない」 is that the situation or outcome is so evident, or the potential problem so minor, that it simply doesn't \"reach the point\" where a particular action is warranted.\n\nThe particle 「も」 (mo) adds an emphatic layer, highlighting the strong lack of necessity. For instance, if something is so obvious, there's not even a need to say it. If a problem is so small, there's not even a need to worry about it. This makes 「までもない」 a stronger expression of unnecessity compared to simpler phrases like 「必要がない」 (there is no need) or 「なくてもいい」 (it's okay not to).\n\nWhen used conjunctively to connect two clauses, the 「て-form」 「までもなく」 is employed. This form often translates to \"without needing to do X\" or \"needless to say, Y.\" While 「までもなくて」 is grammatically possible, 「までもなく」 is overwhelmingly more common.\n\nThis grammar point is widely applicable across various registers and is used by speakers of all genders and age groups without specific restrictions. Its nuance is often about emphasizing the obviousness or triviality of a situation.",
