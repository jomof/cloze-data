    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とあれば」 is derived from the particle 「と」 (which can indicate a condition or assumption) and the conditional (ba-form) of the verb 「ある」 (aru, meaning 'to be'). Thus, it literally means 'if it is the case that'.",
    "writeup": "「とあれば」 is an emphatic version of 「なら」, meaning \"if.\" It's primarily used in formal situations or for literary effect. It translates to \"if (A) is the case, then (B),\" or \"should (A) be true, then (B).\" This expression combines the particle 「と」 and the hypothetical form (ba-form) of the verb 「ある」 (to be), 「あれば」.\n\n「とあれば」 often follows nouns, but can appear after verbs and adjectives when 「と」 functions as a quotation. (A) typically describes a special circumstance, leading to conclusion (B). Being emphatic, (B) usually indicates something unavoidable using structures like 「しかない」, 「なければならない」, 「ざるを得ない」, etc.\n\n「とあれば」 often appears with 「のため」 before it, translating to \"if for the purpose of (A),\" emphasizing the speaker's dedication to (A) in (B).",
