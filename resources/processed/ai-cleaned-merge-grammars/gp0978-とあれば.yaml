        "[Noun] + とあれば": "Emphatic 'if' indicating a strong condition or purpose that justifies a significant action or decision.",

        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Primarily used in formal situations or for literary effect, indicating a weighty condition."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とあれば」 is derived from the particle 「と」 (which can indicate a condition or assumption) and the conditional (ba-form) of the verb 「ある」 (aru, meaning 'to be'). Thus, it literally means 'if it is the case that'.",
    "writeup": "「とあれば」 is an emphatic version of 「なら」, meaning \"if.\" It's primarily used in formal situations or for literary effect, such as in novels or speeches. It translates to \"if (A) is the case, then (B),\" or \"should (A) be true, then (B).\" This expression combines the particle 「と」 and the hypothetical form (ba-form) of the verb 「ある」 (to be), 「あれば」.\n\n「とあれば」 primarily follows nouns, but it can also be seen after verbs and adjectives when 「と」 functions as a quotation. (A) typically describes a special circumstance or a crucial condition that leads to the conclusion or assumption of (B). As this expression is emphatic, (B) will usually indicate something that must be done, or cannot be avoided, often using structures like 「しかない」 (have no choice but to), 「なければならない」 (must do), or 「ざるを得ない」 (cannot help but do), among others.\n\nAn interesting nuance is that 「とあれば」 often appears with 「のため」 before it (e.g., 「～のためとあれば」). This can be translated as 'if for the purpose of (A)' and is used to describe the lengths the speaker is willing to go for (A) in (B), emphasizing their deep commitment or resolve. This makes the condition extremely weighty and the subsequent action unavoidable or highly necessary.",

            "nuance": "The phrase 「日本の 発展」 indicates a grand and noble cause, making the strong declaration 「どんな 困難 でも 乗り越えます」 fitting. The use of 「とあれば」 here elevates the commitment to a higher, more emphatic level, suggesting that this purpose overrides all obstacles and demands extreme effort."
