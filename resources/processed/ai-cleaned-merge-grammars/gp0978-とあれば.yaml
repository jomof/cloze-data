    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the particle 「と」, often used for quotations or conditions, with the conditional form (ba-form) 「あれば」 of the verb 「ある」 (to be). Thus, it literally means 'if it is the case that'.",
    "writeup": "「とあれば」 is a Japanese grammar pattern that serves as an emphatic version of 「なら」 ('if'). It's predominantly used in formal situations or for literary effect, such as in novels. It can be translated as 'if (A) is the case, then (B)' or 'should (A) be true, then (B)'. It combines the case-marking particle 「と」 with the hypothetical form of the う-Verb 「ある」 ('to be'), 「あれば」.\n\n「とあれば」 primarily follows nouns but can also be seen after other structures like verbs and adjectives when 「と」 functions as a quotation. (A) typically represents a special circumstance or condition that leads to the conclusion or assumption of (B), assuming (A) is accurate. \n\nBecause this expression is emphatic, (B) usually indicates something that must be done or can't be avoided, often with structures like 「しかない」, 「なければならない」, 「ざるを得ない」, etc.  It indicates the speaker's willingness to go to great lengths for 'A'.\n\nOften seen with 「のため」 before it. 「のためとあれば」 translates to 'if for the purpose of (A)'.",
