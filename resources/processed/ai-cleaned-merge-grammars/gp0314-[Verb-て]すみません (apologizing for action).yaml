pronunciation:
  katakana: テ スミマセン
  romaji: te sumimasen
formation:
  Verb[て] + すみません: Used to apologize for an action one has performed.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The particle 「て」 connects a verb to the following clause, indicating a cause or sequence. 「すみません」
  literally means "it will not pass/finish," and later evolved to signify "I'm sorry" or "excuse me" because
  the feeling of gratitude or apology does not end. Thus, 「〜てすみません」 means "I am sorry for having done
  ~" or "I apologize for ~ing." Its core meaning is to express that one's feelings of regret or gratitude
  are endless, indicating a genuine sentiment.
writeup: |-
  The phrase 「〜てすみません」 is used to apologize for an action you have performed. It combines the te-form of a verb, which indicates a cause or method, with 「すみません」, a common expression of apology or gratitude. When used together, it creates a polite apology directly tied to a specific action.

  This construction is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of situations where one wishes to express regret or acknowledge inconvenience caused by their actions. It is generally polite, suitable for various social contexts, though its level of formality can vary slightly depending on the context and the specific verb used. It is a fundamental expression for showing remorse or consideration in daily Japanese interactions.
false_friends:
  - term: ごめんなさい
    meaning: I'm sorry (casual)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ごめんなさい」 is a more casual and often more emotional apology than 「すみません」. While 「〜てすみません」 specifies
      the action, 「ごめんなさい」 is a general apology. We're looking for an apology tied to a specific action.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ごめんなさい (i'm sorry)
  - term: 申し訳ありません
    meaning: I am truly sorry (formal)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「申し訳ありません」 is a more formal and deeply apologetic expression, often used in business or very
      serious situations. 「〜てすみません」 is a more general polite apology. We're looking for a polite, general
      apology.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:申し訳ありません (I am truly sorry)
  - term: 〜ていただく
    meaning: to have someone do something for you (receive a favor)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both use the te-form followed by another verb, 「〜ていただく」 expresses receiving a favor,
      indicating gratitude, not an apology for an action performed. We're looking for an apology.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]もらう (to have someone do, receive an action)'
post_false_friends_writeup: It is important to distinguish 「〜てすみません」 from other apologies and te-form
  constructions. While 「ごめんなさい」 and 「申し訳ありません」 are general apologies, 「〜てすみません」 explicitly links the apology
  to a specific action. Additionally, be careful not to confuse it with constructions like 「〜ていただく」, which
  express receiving a favor, as the nuance is completely different. The key is that 「すみません」 here is used
  to express regret for an action you have done, rather than gratitude for an action performed by someone
  else.

post_example_writeup: The examples provided demonstrate how 「〜てすみません」 can be used in various situations
  to express apologies for actions ranging from minor inconveniences to more significant mistakes. Pay
  attention to the verb's te-form and the overall context to choose the most appropriate way to apologize
  in Japanese. Remember that while 「すみません」 is generally polite, the severity of the apology can be intensified
  by using more formal expressions like 「申し訳ありません」. Consider the relationship with the listener and the
  gravity of the situation when choosing between 「すみません」 and its more formal counterparts. While 「すいません」
  is a common, slightly more casual pronunciation, it carries the same meaning.
