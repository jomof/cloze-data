    "etymology": "The grammar point 「そうにない」 is derived from 「そう」, which expresses a conjecture based on appearance. Adding 「にない」 negates that appearance, indicating the unlikelihood of something happening or the absence of any indication that it will.",
    "writeup": "「そうにない」 is a grammatical expression used to indicate that something is **unlikely to happen** or **shows no signs of occurring**. It suggests a low probability based on current appearances or circumstances. This expression is similar to 「そうもない」, but generally carries a slightly less emphatic nuance of unlikelihood.\n\nIt attaches to the **ます-stem** of a verb. For example, 「できそうにない」 means \"unlikely to be able to do\" or \"doesn't look like it can be done.\" The core meaning is derived from the auxiliary verb 「そう」 (indicating appearance or conjecture) combined with the negative form 「ない」, meaning \"not having such an appearance.\"\n\nOccasionally, you may also encounter 「そうにもない」. While 「そうにない」 and 「そうもない」 convey unlikelihood, 「そうにもない」 expresses the strongest nuance among the three, emphasizing an even greater improbability. The distinction between these forms lies in the nuanced addition, subtraction, or combination of the particles に and も.",
