    "etymology": "The grammar point 「としても」 combines 「として」 (as, in the capacity of) with 「も」 (even). Therefore, it literally means \"even as\" or \"even in the capacity of.\" The 「として」 part indicates a role, position, or viewpoint, while 「も」 adds the nuance of \"even if we consider it from that perspective.\"",
    "writeup": "「としても」 is a structure used in Japanese to express thoughts about a hypothetical situation (A), assuming it were true. This can be translated as \"even if we assume that it's (A)\" or \"assuming that (A).\" It implies that despite (A) potentially not being factual, the speaker is willing to consider it for the sake of argument before presenting their perspective on that hypothetical scenario. Furthermore, 「としても」 can carry a stronger sense of concession or reservation compared to similar expressions like 「ても」.\n\n「としても」 typically follows verbs and い-adjectives in their plain forms. For nouns and な-adjectives, it generally follows the plain form with 「だ」.\n\nIn some contexts, 「としても」 functions as an extension of 「として」, meaning \"even as (A).\" This nuance primarily highlights individuals or organizations in a specific position (A) and indicates that \"even for (A), it will still be (B).\" This usage of 「としても」 is restricted to nouns.",
