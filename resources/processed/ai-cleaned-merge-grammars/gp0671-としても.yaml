    "etymology": "The grammar point 「としても」 combines 「として」 (as, in the capacity of) with 「も」 (even). Therefore, it literally means \"even as\" or \"even in the capacity of.\" The 「として」 part indicates a role, position, or viewpoint, while 「も」 adds the nuance of \"even if we consider it from that perspective.\"",
    "writeup": "「としても」 is used to express a hypothetical situation or assumption. It conveys the meaning of \"even if we assume that...\" or \"assuming that...\".  It's used to present a scenario that might not be true but is being considered for the sake of argument. It is similar to 「ても」, but 「としても」 can sometimes carry a stronger sense of concession or reservation. When attached directly to a noun, 「としても」 can extend the meaning of 「として」 (\"as\"), to mean \"even as\".",
