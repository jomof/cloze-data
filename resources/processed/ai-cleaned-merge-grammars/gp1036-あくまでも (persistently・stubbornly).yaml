jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: formal
  usage-context: Primarily used in formal and business contexts to emphasize unwavering resolve or strict
    adherence to a principle. Can also appear in casual speech for strong insistence or to make a precise
    qualification, but its inherent strength often elevates the tone.
etymology: The term 「あくまでも」 comes from 「飽く」 (aku), an older form of 「飽きる」 (akiru), meaning 'to get tired
  of' or 'to be sated.' The suffix 「までも」 adds the nuance of 'even to the extent of' or 'up to.' Therefore,
  「あくまでも」 originally meant 'to the extent that one is completely satiated or fed up,' implying an action
  is continued until its absolute limit, or with unwavering resolve, often despite personal exhaustion
  or external resistance. This historical meaning clearly illustrates why it expresses persistence, stubbornness,
  or doing something 'to the bitter end.'
writeup: 「あくまでも」 is an adverb that conveys the idea of doing something **persistently**, **stubbornly**,
  or **to the bitter end**. It emphasizes continuing an action or holding onto an opinion regardless of
  the circumstances. The literal sense of continuing until one is completely 'tired of it' or 'satiated'
  highlights the unwavering nature of the action or conviction. It is commonly used to express strong
  resolve, insistence, or a firm stance, suggesting that the action or belief will not be swayed by external
  factors or difficulties.

  - term: 結局
    meaning: In the end, after all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「あくまでも」, 「結局」 focuses on the final result or outcome, not the persistent effort leading
      up to it.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:結局 (after all)
  - term: とうとう
    meaning: Finally, eventually
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とうとう」 implies something has finally happened after a period of time, while 「あくまでも」 emphasizes
      the unwavering persistence leading to the situation.
    grammar_point: とうとう (finally・eventually)
  - term: どこまでも
    meaning: Anywhere, to any extent, to the very end
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「どこまでも」 can mean 'to the very end' in terms of distance or extent, it generally lacks
      the nuance of stubborn insistence or unwavering personal resolve that 「あくまでも」 possesses. It often
      implies a boundless or indefinite continuation, whereas 「あくまでも」 suggests a firm commitment against
      odds.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どこまでも (to the very end)
  - term: 最後まで
    meaning: Until the end
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「最後まで」 simply indicates an action continuing until its conclusion or a specific point in time.
      「あくまでも」 implies an unwavering resolve or stubbornness throughout that duration, often suggesting
      that the action continues *despite* challenges or the speaker being tired of it.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:最後まで (until the end)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「結局」, 「とうとう」, 「どこまでも」, and 「最後まで」 can sometimes seem similar, it's important
  to remember that 「あくまでも」 always carries the nuance of persistent, unwavering action or insistence, often
  against odds. Focus on whether the sentence emphasizes the effort and determination, rather than just
  the final result, passage of time, or reaching a boundary.
