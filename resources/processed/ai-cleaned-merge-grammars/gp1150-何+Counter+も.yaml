The 「も」 (mo) adds emphasis to the quantity, implying \"many\" or \"a lot of.\" It can be used with or without a specific number before the counter. For instance, 「何人も」 means \"many people,\" while 「何百人」 means \"hundreds of people.\"  The structure 「何+Counter+もの+Noun」 is used to modify a noun, indicating a large quantity of that noun; for example, 「何百人もの学生」 means \"hundreds of students.\"",
