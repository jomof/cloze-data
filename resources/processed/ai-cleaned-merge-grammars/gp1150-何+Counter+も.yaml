        "何 + Counter + も": "To express 'many' or 'dozens/hundreds/thousands of ~' directly.",

        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "Used to emphasize a large, indefinite quantity or number of something. The specific counter used depends on the noun being quantified (e.g., 冊 for books, 人 for people, 回 for times).",
        "function": "Functions as a quantifier for large, indefinite numbers. The particle も (mo) adds emphasis to the largeness of the quantity.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the quantity is surprisingly or remarkably large, often to an extent that it's difficult to count precisely. The focus is on the sheer volume rather than a specific, countable amount. It conveys a sense of abundance or repetition.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as an adverbial phrase when directly quantifying (e.g., 何回も) or as an adjectival phrase when modifying a noun (e.g., 何千人もの人々)."
    },
    "etymology": "The term combines 「何」 (nan), which usually means \"what\" or \"how many\" when used interrogatively, with a counter word (e.g., 回, 人, 冊), and the particle 「も」 (mo). In this construction, 「何」 loses its interrogative sense and, combined with the counter, implies an indefinite but large quantity. The particle 「も」, which typically means \"also\" or \"even,\" here serves to emphasize the unexpected or significant size of the quantity, much like \"as many as\" or \"no less than\" in English.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「何+Counter+も」 is used to express a large, indefinite quantity of something. It signifies \"many,\" \"dozens of,\" \"hundreds of,\" or \"thousands of\" a particular item or instance. The core meaning conveyed is that the number is significant and often surpasses casual expectation.\n\nThere are two primary patterns for its usage:\n\n*   **「何 + Counter + も」**: This pattern directly quantifies, indicating a large number of times, people, or items. For example, 「{何回も}」 means \"many times,\" and 「{何人も}」 means \"many people.\" This form often acts adverbially, describing the frequency or quantity of an action or state.\n\n*   **「何 + Counter + もの + Noun」**: This pattern is used when the large quantity is modifying a specific noun. For example, 「{何十冊もの}本」 translates to \"dozens of books\" or \"many books.\" Here, the entire phrase 「何+Counter+もの」 functions adjectivally, describing the subsequent noun.\n\nThis grammar point is highly versatile and can be employed in both formal and casual settings, though its inherent emphasis on a large quantity can lend a slightly more dramatic or impactful tone depending on the context. It is widely used to highlight abundance, frequency, or scale in a non-specific yet emphatic manner.",
