meaning: not very or much
pronunciation:
  katakana: アマリ ナイ
  romaji: amari nai
formation:
  Adverb + Negative Verb/Adjective/Noun: Indicates a low degree or insufficient amount of something. Used
    to negate or lessen the extent of an action, state, or quality.
jlpt: N5
etymology: 「あまり」 originates from 「余り」 (あまり), meaning "remainder," "excess," or "more than." In its adverbial
  usage, especially with negation, it came to mean "not much," "not very," or "not exceeding (a certain
  level/expectation)." The core idea of "remainder" or "excess" then applied to the *lack* of something
  significant when used in a negative context. For example, if there's "not much excess" (余りがない), it implies
  a scarcity. Over time, this evolved to denote a modest degree of something, particularly when followed
  by a negative.
writeup: 'The phrase 「あまり〜ない」 (amari ~ nai) is a fundamental Japanese expression used to indicate that
  something is "not very," "not much," or "not really" the case. It softens a negative statement, suggesting
  a degree of insufficiency rather than an absolute absence or strong negation. This construction typically
  pairs the adverb 「あまり」 with the plain negative form of a verb, an い-adjective, or a な-adjective/noun
  followed by 「ではない」 or 「じゃない」. 「あまり」 functions as a degree adverb, modifying the extent of the negation.
  It''s crucial to remember that 「あまり」 almost exclusively appears with negative predicates. Using it with
  a positive predicate (e.g., 「あまり好きだ」) is generally incorrect and unnatural, though 「あまりにも」 can sometimes
  appear with positive forms to mean "too much." Consider the nuance: if you say 「あまり食べない」 (amari tabenai),
  it means "I don''t eat much," implying you eat some, but not a lot. This differs from 「全く食べない」 (mattaku
  tabenai), which means "I don''t eat at all." The choice between 「あまり〜ない」 and stronger negations depends
  on the precise degree of negation you wish to convey. It often expresses a feeling of things not quite
  meeting expectations or being less than what one might desire.'

  - term: 全く〜ない (mattaku ~ nai)
    meaning: not at all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「全く〜ない」 expresses a complete and absolute negation, meaning "not at all." Unlike 「あまり〜ない」,
      which indicates a lesser degree or partial absence, 「全く〜ない」 leaves no room for any presence or occurrence
      of the negated item or action.
    grammar_point: 全く〜ない (not at all)
  - term: 少しも〜ない (sukoshimo ~ nai)
    meaning: not even a little
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「少しも〜ない」 also indicates an absolute negation, similar to 「全く〜ない」, but often emphasizes the
      *lack* of even the slightest amount or degree. It can convey a stronger sense of surprise or disappointment
      about the complete absence.
    grammar_point: すこしも〜ない (not even a little)
  - term: ほとんど〜ない (hotondo ~ nai)
    meaning: hardly ever / almost never
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ほとんど〜ない」 means "hardly ever" or "almost not." It's closer in meaning to 「あまり〜ない」 in that
      it implies a very low frequency or degree, but it usually suggests that the action/state happens
      so rarely that it's almost non-existent. 「あまり〜ない」 can still imply a noticeable but small amount,
      while 「ほとんど〜ない」 pushes it closer to zero.
    grammar_point: ほとんど (almost all or hardly any)
  - term: あまりにも (amari nimo)
    meaning: too much; excessively
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While it uses 「あまり」, 「あまりにも」 is an intensifier used with *positive* statements (or negative
      statements where "too much" of a negative quality is expressed). It means "too much" or "excessively,"
      often carrying a sense of being overwhelmed or that something is beyond a reasonable degree. This
      is the opposite of the 「あまり〜ない」 construction.
    grammar_point: あまりに (excessively・too much)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「あまり〜ない」, 「全く〜ない」, 「少しも〜ない」, and 「ほとんど〜ない」, remember
  that 「あまり〜ない」 implies "not much," allowing for a small amount or occasional occurrence. In contrast,
  「全く〜ない」 and 「少しも〜ない」 convey an absolute "not at all," with the latter adding emphasis to the complete
  lack. 「ほとんど〜ない」 sits between 「あまり〜ない」 and absolute negation, meaning "hardly ever" or "almost not,"
  suggesting something is very close to non-existent. Lastly, 「あまりにも」 stands apart as an intensifier for
  positive situations, meaning "excessively."

post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「あまり〜ない」 is a versatile phrase for expressing a moderate
  degree of negation. It allows for a nuanced expression of "not very" or "not much," making it distinct
  from more absolute negative constructions. The specific conjugation of the verb or adjective will follow
  standard Japanese grammar rules for negation and tense, allowing 「あまり」 to modify various types of predicates.
