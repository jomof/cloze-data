formation:
  あまり + [Verb/Adjective in ない form]: Indicates something is 'not very' or 'hardly' something. Only the
    ない form of verbs, i-adjectives, and na-adjectives can follow あまり in this construction. For nouns,
    you would use あまり + Noun + ではない (or じゃ ない).
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express that something is not true to a significant degree, implying 'not excessively'
    or 'hardly' rather than absolute negation.
  function: Adverbial modifier that softens or qualifies negative statements, indicating a lesser degree
    or frequency.
  nuance: Implies a nuanced negative rather than an absolute one. It conveys that something is not 'as
    much as expected' or 'to a great extent,' rather than 'not at all.' Often used to express subjective
    feelings or moderate dissatisfaction.
  grammatical-role: Modifies verbs, i-adjectives, and na-adjectives in their negative form.
  logical-flow: Softens the degree of the negative statement, indicating a partial rather than absolute
    absence or lack of an attribute or action.
  temporal-flow: Applies to actions or states that occur or exist with less frequency or intensity over
    time.
  spatial-flow: Not directly applicable; relates more to abstract degree or quantity rather than physical
    space.
etymology: The word 「あまり」 comes from the verb 余る (amaru), meaning "to remain, to be left over, to be in
  excess." Thus, 「あまり」 retains this sense of "excess," but when used with the negative 「ない」, it indicates
  that something is *not* in excess, hence "not very" or "hardly."
writeup: "「あまり」 is a flexible word used in various grammar points. When paired with the 「ない」 form of a\
  \ verb or adjective, it translates to \"not very (A)\" or \"hardly (A).\" To use 「あまり」 (or its casual\
  \ form, 「あんまり」), you place it at the beginning of a phrase, or directly before the 「ない」 statement. \n\
  \n**Important Considerations:**  \n*   Although 「あまり〜ない」 is regularly translated as \"not very,\" the\
  \ literal translation is closer to \"not excessively (A).\"  \n*   「あまり」 retains this meaning of \"\
  excessive\" in all its grammar points, and the nuance will only change based on whether the sentence\
  \ itself is positive (does not use 「ない」) or negative (uses 「ない」)."
false_friends:
  - term: なかなか
    meaning: Very, Quite, Considerably
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While 「あまり」 with a negative implies 'not very,' 「なかなか」 often suggests the opposite, such as
      'quite good' or 'considerably improved.'
    grammar_point: なかなか (quite not easily)
  - term: あまり
    meaning: So much...that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This usage of 「あまり」 (without 「ない」) expresses a degree of excess. Unlike 「あまり〜ない」, it doesn't
      mean 'not very,' but rather 'so much that...'
    grammar_point: あまり (so much that)
  - term: そんなに〜ない
    meaning: Not that much; not so much
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「そんなに〜ない」 is often interchangeable with 「あまり〜ない」, conveying a similar sense of 'not to that
      extent' or 'not very.' Both soften the degree of negation.
    grammar_point: そんなに (that much or so)
  - term: 少しも〜ない
    meaning: Not even a little, Not at all, Not in the least
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「少しも〜ない」 emphasizes a complete lack of something, conveying a stronger and more absolute negation
      than 「あまり〜ない」, which suggests a lesser degree.
    grammar_point: すこしも〜ない (not even a little)
  - term: 全く〜ない
    meaning: Not at all, Not in the slightest
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Like 「少しも〜ない」, 「全く〜ない」 implies an absolute absence or complete negation, contrasting with
      the partial or limited lack indicated by 「あまり〜ない」.
    grammar_point: 全く〜ない (not at all)
  - term: なかなか〜ない
    meaning: Hardly, Not easily or readily, By no means
    kind: synonym
    nuance: This phrase indicates that something is difficult to achieve or doesn't occur easily. While
      it conveys a 'hardly' similar to 「あまり〜ない」, its focus is more on the ease or difficulty of an action
      rather than the degree of a state.
    grammar_point: なかなか〜ない (not easily)
  - term: 別に〜ない
    meaning: Not really, Not particularly, It's not like...
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「別に〜ない」 implies a lack of specialness or particular interest, often used to dismiss something
      as ordinary or unimportant, whereas 「あまり〜ない」 focuses on quantity or degree.
    grammar_point: 別に〜ない (not particularly)
  - term: めったに〜ない
    meaning: Hardly ever, Rarely, Seldom
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「めったに〜ない」 specifically indicates infrequent occurrence or low frequency, unlike 「あまり〜ない」,
      which refers to a lack of intensity or amount.
    grammar_point: めったに〜ない (rarely)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「あまり〜ない」 with similar expressions, remember that 「あまり〜ない」
  focuses on degree or amount, indicating that something is "not very" or "hardly" something. Other similar
  expressions may emphasize a complete absence, difficulty, lack of interest, or infrequent occurrence.

  - english: Today's meeting wasn't very interesting.
    japanese:
      - 今日 の 会議 は {あまり} 面白く {なかっ た} です。
      - 今日 の 会議 は {あまり} 面白く {なかっ た}。
      - 今日 の 会議 は {あまり} 面白く {あり ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: Today's meeting was not very interesting.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 の 会議 は {面白く なかっ た} です。
        english: Today's meeting was not interesting.
        hint: 「あまり」 softens the negation, implying "not very" rather than "not at all." We're looking
          for a nuanced statement that implies "not very interesting." Choose the option that describes
          a meeting that was only mildly uninteresting.
    scene: A man recounting his day to his wife after returning home from work.

  - english: He's not very good at cooking, so he always eats out.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 料理 が {あまり} 上手 じゃ {ない} から、いつ も 外食 です。
      - 彼 は 料理 が {あまり} 上手 で は {あり ませ ん} から、いつ も 外食 です。
      - 彼 は 料理 が {あんまり} 上手 じゃ {ない} から、いつ も 外食 です。
    english_literally: He, as for cooking, is not very skillful, so always eating out.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 料理 が {下手 だ} から、いつ も 外食 です。
        english: He is bad at cooking, so he always eats out.
        hint: 「下手」 directly states a lack of skill, which can sound blunt. 「あまり上手じゃない」 softens this, indicating
          a lesser degree of skill. We're looking for a more subtle expression of lack of skill.
    scene: Two women casually discussing a mutual male friend's habits.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「〜じゃ ない」 is a casual negative for adjectives. The conversational tone and the use
      of 「外食です」 (eats out) to justify the statement suggest a commonplace observation between friends.
      The slight pause after 「あまり」 allows for the softening of the statement, implying a gentle critique
      rather than a harsh one for 「上手じゃない」 (not skillful).
  - english: I don't really feel like watching recent movies.
    japanese:
      - 最近 の 映画 は {あまり} 見る 気 に {なら ない}。

        english: I don't want to watch recent movies.
        hint: 「見たくない」 expresses a direct desire not to watch. 「あまり見る気にならない」 suggests a lack of motivation
          or inclination rather than a direct refusal. We're looking for an expression of mild disinclination.
    scene: Someone expressing their lack of interest in current entertainment trends.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
  - english: This problem is not very simple.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 問題 は {難しい} です。
        english: This problem is difficult.
        hint: 「難しいです」 is a direct statement of difficulty. 「あまり簡単ではありません」 is a more polite and indirect
          way to express difficulty, implying it's "not as simple as it seems." We're looking for a polite
          and softened statement.
    scene: A student politely informing their teacher about the difficulty of a task.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)

        english: If he didn't get angry, he'd probably be more popular.
        hint: 「怒らなかったら」 suggests an absolute lack of anger. 「あまり怒らなかったら」 implies if he was not angry *much*
          or *often*. We're looking for a condition that implies less frequent anger.
    scene: Two colleagues discussing a difficult boss's personality and its impact.
    register: semi-formal

          - 週末 は 外 に {出かけ ませ ん でし た}。
        english: I didn't go out on the weekend.
        hint: Without 「あまり」, it implies a complete lack of going out. 「あまり出かけませんでした」 means you didn't
          go out *much*. We're looking for a statement about limited activity.
    scene: A person explaining their quiet weekend plans to a friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)

    english_literally: This time slot, trains are not very crowded.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 時間 帯 は 全く 電車 が {混ん で い ない} よ。
        english: The trains aren't crowded at all at this time.
        hint: 「全く混んでいない」 implies zero crowds. 「あまり混んでいない」 suggests some people, but not *very* crowded.
          We're looking for a statement that implies a moderate level of crowd.
    scene: A woman advising her male friend on the best time to commute to avoid congestion.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「よ」 at the end of the sentence is a common sentence-final particle used by both
      men and women to give new information or advice in a friendly, assertive way. The sentence is practical
      advice, fitting a casual interaction between friends. The use of 「あまり」 softens the statement, implying
      that while there might be some people, it's generally a comfortable time to commute, which is less
      absolute than 「全く」 (completely) and thus more encouraging.
  - english: There wasn't much progress on that project today.
    japanese:
      - 今日 は その プロジェクト で {あまり} 進捗 が {あり ませ ん でし た}。
      - 今日 は その プロジェクト で {あまり} 進捗 が {なかっ た}。
      - 今日 は その プロジェクト で {あんまり} 進捗 が {あり ませ ん でし た}。
      - 今日 は その プロジェクト で {あんまり} 進捗 が {なかっ た}。
    english_literally: Today, as for that project, there was not much progress.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は その プロジェクト で 進捗 が {あり ませ ん でし た}。
        english: There was no progress on that project today.
        hint: Without 「あまり」, it implies zero progress. We're looking for a statement indicating limited,
          not absolute, progress.
    scene: A project manager reporting to a senior executive at the end of the day.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    nuance: Using 「あまり〜ありませんでした」 softens the negative report, suggesting that while progress was limited,
      it wasn't a complete standstill. This is common in professional settings to convey information politely
      without being overly blunt.
  - english: I don't really like vegetables.
    japanese:
      - 僕 は 野菜 が {あまり} 好き じゃ {ない} ん だ。
      - 俺 は 野菜 が {あんまり} 好き じゃ {ない} ん だ。
    english_literally: As for me, vegetables are not very liked.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 僕 は 野菜 が {嫌い だ}。
        english: I hate vegetables.
        hint: 「嫌い」 expresses a strong dislike. 「あまり好きじゃない」 softens this, implying a mild dislike or lack
          of preference rather than hatred. We're looking for a milder expression of dislike.
    scene: A young man casually talking to a friend about his eating habits during lunch.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「僕」 (boku) and 「んだ」 (nda) adds a casual and somewhat self-deprecating tone, typical
      of younger male speakers. 「あまり好きじゃない」 (amari suki ja nai) is a common way to express mild dislike
      without being too direct, which fits a friendly, casual setting. The alternative 「俺」 (ore) with
      「あんまり」 reinforces the casual and slightly rougher male speech.
  - english: My grandmother doesn't really hear well anymore.
    japanese:
      - 祖母 は 最近、{あまり} よく {聞こえ ない} よう です。
      - 祖母 は 最近、{あんまり} よく {聞こえ ない} よう です。
    english_literally: My grandmother recently, it seems, doesn't hear very well.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 祖母 は 最近、耳 が {遠い} よう です。
        english: My grandmother recently seems hard of hearing.
        hint: 「耳が遠い」 is a direct way to say someone is hard of hearing, which can be less polite. 「あまりよく聞こえない」
          is a softer way to describe diminished hearing ability. We're looking for a gentler description.
    scene: A grandchild discussing their grandmother's health with a family member or close friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: sympathetic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: Using 「あまりよく聞こえない」 (amari yoku kikoenai) is a polite and empathetic way to describe someone's
      reduced hearing ability, softening the direct statement. The addition of 「ようです」 (yō desu) further
      softens it by expressing that it 'seems' to be the case, rather than stating it as a fact. This
      tone is appropriate when discussing a sensitive topic like an elderly relative's health.
  - english: Because I don't really understand, please explain it one more time.
    japanese:
      - '{あまり} 分 から {なく て}、もう 一 度 説明 し て ください。'
      - '{あんまり} 分 から {なく て}、もう 一 度 説明 し て ください。'
    english_literally: Because I don't understand much, please explain one more time.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 分 から {ない の で}、もう 一 度 説明 し て ください。
        english: Because I don't understand, please explain it one more time.
        hint: 「分からないので」 states a direct lack of understanding. 「あまり分からなくて」 implies a partial understanding
          or mild confusion, making the request more polite. We're looking for a polite request that implies
          not fully grasping something.
    scene: A student asking a teacher for further clarification on a complex topic.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The use of 「あまり分からなくて」 (amari wakaranakute) softens the reason for the request, making it
      sound less like a complete failure to understand and more like a partial lack of clarity. This is
      a polite way to ask for repetition or further explanation, commonly used in educational or professional
      settings.
  - english: Please don't talk too loudly.
    japanese:
      - '{あまり} 大きな 声 で 話さ {ない で ください}。'
      - '{あんまり} 大きな 声 で 話さ {ない で ください}。'
    english_literally: Please do not speak with too much loud voice.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 大きな 声 で {話さ ない で ください}。
        english: Please don't talk in a loud voice.
        hint: Without 「あまり」, it's a direct prohibition on loud talking. 「あまり話さないでください」 asks not to talk
          *too* loudly, allowing for some volume. We're looking for a request to moderate volume, not
          eliminate it.
    scene: A librarian reminding patrons to keep their voices down in a study area.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: imperative polite (～なさい)
    nuance: Using 「あまり〜ないでください」 (amari ~naide kudasai) softens the command, making it a polite request
      to *reduce* the degree of an action rather than to stop it entirely. In this context, it's a gentle
      reminder to not be *too* loud, rather than to be completely silent. This is a common way to express
      polite requests or instructions.
post_example_writeup: As observed in the examples, 「あまり〜ない」 can be used with various negative forms of
  verbs and adjectives to soften the negation. It indicates that something is not true to a great extent,
  rather than being completely false. This nuance allows for more flexible and less direct communication.
