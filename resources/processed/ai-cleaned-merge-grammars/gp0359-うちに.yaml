    "etymology": "The word 「うち」 originally refers to the inside of something, like a house or a container. The grammar point 「うちに」 extends this meaning to refer to the \"inside\" of a time period or condition. It suggests that something happens within that limited scope or before that condition changes.",
    "writeup": "「うちに」 indicates that an action or event occurs within a specific time frame or before a certain condition changes. It often implies taking advantage of a limited opportunity or preventing an undesirable outcome. It can be translated as \"while,\" \"during,\" or \"before.\" Unlike 「間に」, 「うちに」 doesn't specify *when* something happens within the given period, just that it happens at some point before the period ends or the condition changes.\n\n**Key Uses:**\n\n*   **Non-past verbs:** Expresses doing something while a certain condition is still valid. Example: 「元気なうちに旅行に行きましょう」 (Let's go on a trip while we're still healthy).\n*   **ている form verbs:** Indicates that something happens during the course of an action. Example: 「運転しているうちに眠くなった」 (I got sleepy while driving).\n*   **ない form verbs:** Means \"before\" something happens or a certain state changes. Example: 「忘れないうちにメモしておこう」 (Let's make a note before we forget).\n*   **い-adjectives and な-adjectives:** While the adjective's state is still true. Example: 「高いうちに売った方がいい」 (You should sell it while it's still expensive).\n*   **Nouns:** During the time period indicated by the noun. Example: 「夏休みのうちに宿題を終わらせたい」 (I want to finish my homework during summer vacation).",
