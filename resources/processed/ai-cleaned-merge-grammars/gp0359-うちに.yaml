    "etymology": "The word 「うち」 literally means \"inside\" or \"within.\" The addition of 「に」 as a case-marking particle indicates a location or time frame within which something occurs. The nuance is that the action happens within the bounds of that period or state.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「うちに」 expresses that something happens or should happen within a certain time or condition. It conveys the idea of \"while\" or \"during\" a specific period. The nuance often suggests that it is the best or optimal time to do something before a change occurs. Unlike 「間に」, 「うちに」 does not specify exactly when the action occurs within the given time frame; it simply indicates that it happens sometime within that period. It can be used with verbs in the plain non-past form, verbs in the ている form, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (followed by な), and nouns followed by の.",
