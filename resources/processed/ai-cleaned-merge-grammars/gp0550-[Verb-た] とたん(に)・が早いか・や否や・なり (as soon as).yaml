etymology: The expressions `とたん(に)`, `が早いか`, `や否や`, and `なり` each convey a sense of immediate succession,
  but their etymological roots provide insight into their subtle differences. `途端 (とたん)` is a compound
  of `途` (to), meaning 'way' or 'road', and `端` (tan), meaning 'edge' or 'tip'. This conveys the sense
  of being 'at the very edge' or 'on the tip' of something, emphasizing an immediate transition. The particle
  `に` reinforces this adverbial timing. `が早いか` combines the particle `が`, the adjective `早い` (hayai, 'fast'
  or 'early'), and the question particle `か`. It literally asks
writeup: |-
  The Japanese language offers several nuanced ways to express the idea of "as soon as" or "the moment" one action immediately follows another. The grammar point `[Verb-た] とたん(に)・が早いか・や否や・なり` encompasses four distinct expressions: `とたん(に)`, `が早いか`, `や否や`, and `なり`. While they all signify immediate succession, they carry different nuances of formality, spontaneity, unexpectedness, and typical usage contexts. Understanding these subtleties is key to using them accurately.

  **1. とたん(に) (Verb た-form + とたん(に))**

  `とたん(に)` (written with kanji as `途端に`) expresses that an action or event occurs immediately after another, often with a sense of **immediacy and unexpectedness**. It implies that the moment one thing happened, another followed almost simultaneously or without any perceptible delay. The construction is formed by attaching `途端に` to the past tense (た-form) of a verb. The subsequent event described (B in the pattern 'A とたん(に) B') is typically something that is beyond the speaker's direct control, surprising, or coincidental. This expression is more conversational and less formal compared to `が早いか` or `や否や`.

  **2. が早いか (Verb Dictionary/た-form + が早いか)**

  `が早いか` is a more **formal and literary** expression used to describe two actions that occur in very quick succession. It conveys the sense that 'no sooner did A happen, than B happened.' The verb preceding `が早いか` can be in its dictionary (plain non-past) or past plain form, though the dictionary form is generally more common. This construction emphasizes the instantaneousness of the second action (B), suggesting that the first action (A) was hardly complete before (B) commenced. While the B action often occurs unexpectedly, it is usually volitional or a clear, observable event. `が早いか` is generally not used for the speaker's own impulsive actions and is more common in written narratives.

  **3. や否や (Verb Dictionary-form + や否や)**

  `や否や` is a **highly formal and literary** expression, predominantly found in written Japanese, news articles, and formal narratives. It conveys the meaning of "as soon as" or "the moment that" one action occurs, another action immediately follows, with **virtually no time lag**. The first action is typically a verb in its dictionary form, emphasizing the instant completion of that action. This pattern is used when the second action is spontaneous, sudden, or often dramatic, implying an absolute lack of delay. The subjects of the two clauses can be the same or different. Sometimes, the `否や` part can be omitted, leaving just `～や`, which carries the same meaning but is even more concise and literary.

  **4. なり (Verb Dictionary-form + なり)**

  `なり` expresses that something happens immediately after something else, conveying the meaning of "as soon as (A), then (B)" or "the moment (A) happens, then (B)". It connects two events that occur in very quick succession, highlighting the instantaneous nature of the cause-and-effect relationship. This grammar point is typically used with verbs in their dictionary form. The second part of the sentence (B) often describes something surprising, unexpected, or a **strong reaction driven by emotion or will**. It is almost exclusively used to describe the actions of others, rather than the speaker themselves. While `なり` can be perceived as slightly old-fashioned or formal, it adds a certain literary flair and dramatic emphasis to the immediacy of events.

  - term: すぐ
    meaning: Immediately; soon; right away

post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share the idea of immediacy, they differ significantly

  emotional, reaction.

      unexpected and involuntary nuance that `途端に` conveys when the second event is beyond the speaker's
      direct control.

      involuntary, almost physical reaction to emotion, where the tears 'spill out' as if a container

      by `とたん(に)`.

    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

      an older speaker. The casual register is fitting for a personal anecdote about a family pet. The
      phrase 「喜び で 飛び跳ねた」 effectively conveys the immediate and joyful reaction.
    etymology: 「飛び跳ねる (とびはねる)」 means "to jump around" or "to leap up and down." It combines 「飛ぶ (とぶ)」
      "to jump" with 「跳ねる (はねる)」 "to leap/bounce," vividly describing the dog's enthusiastic movements.
post_example_writeup: These examples demonstrate the diverse applications of `とたん(に)`, `が早いか`, `や否や`,
  and `なり` to describe immediate succession. While each carries the core meaning of 'as soon as,' the
  specific choice depends on the desired nuance of unexpectedness, spontaneity, formality, or emphasis
  on the subject's reaction. Pay close attention to the context and what aspect of the immediate temporal
  relationship you wish to highlight.
