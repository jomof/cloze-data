id: gp9999
meaning: even if; even though; no matter how/what/who/where/when
pronunciation:
  katakana: テモ
  romaji: temo
formation:
  Verb (て-form) + も: Indicates that the action or state of the main clause is true or happens regardless
    of the condition expressed by the verb in the て-form.
  Interrogative + Verb (て-form) + も: Used to express 'no matter how/what/who/where/when' by combining
    an interrogative word (e.g., いつ, どこ, だれ, いくら, どんなに) with the て-form of a verb and も.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  function: Expresses concession, indicating that the action or state of the main clause holds true regardless
    of the condition presented in the て-form clause. It signifies 'even if,' 'even though,' or 'no matter
    what/how/who/where/when' depending on the context or presence of an interrogative.
  nuance: Often implies a surprising or unexpected outcome, or a statement of universal truth that holds
    true under various conditions. When combined with interrogatives, it emphasizes that the outcome remains
    the same irrespective of the specific choice or quantity.
  grammatical-role: Connects two clauses, with the first clause setting a condition and the second clause
    stating an outcome that is unaffected by that condition.
etymology: The structure Verb[て] + も derives from the conjunctive て-form of a verb, which indicates a
  sequence or manner, combined with the particle も. The particle も inherently carries the meaning of 'also'
  or 'even.' Thus, Verb[て] + も literally means 'even by doing [verb]' or 'even if [verb] is done,' leading
  to its concessive meaning of 'even if' or 'even though.'
writeup: |-
  The grammatical pattern Verb[ても] is used to express a concessive meaning, similar to 'even if,' 'even though,' or 'no matter what/how/who/where/when' in English. It is formed by taking the て-form of a verb and attaching the particle も. This construction indicates that the action or state in the main clause will occur or remain true regardless of the condition described in the て-form clause.

  One common usage is to state a general truth or something that holds true under various circumstances. For example, 「雨が降っても、試合は続く」 (Even if it rains, the game will continue) implies that the rain is not a factor that will stop the game.

  Another significant use is with interrogative words (such as いつ, どこ, だれ, なに, いくら, どんなに). When combined with Verb[ても], these form expressions like 「いつ食べても」 (no matter when I eat), 「どこに行っても」 (no matter where I go), or 「だれが来ても」 (no matter who comes). This emphasizes that the outcome is constant, irrespective of the variable introduced by the interrogative.

  While other conditional forms like 〜たら or 〜ば also mean 'if,' Verb[ても] specifically adds the nuance of 'even if,' highlighting that the subsequent action or state is unaffected by the preceding condition, often implying a surprising or strong determination.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜けど・けれども
    meaning: but; although
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜けど」 simply connects two clauses with a sense of contrast or concession. It lacks the strong
      'even if' emphasis of Verb[ても] and does not imply that the condition is overcome or irrelevant.
    grammar_point: しかし・だが・けれど・しかしながら (but・however)
  - term: 〜のに
    meaning: even though; despite
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both are concessive, 「〜のに」 often carries a nuance of dissatisfaction, regret, or surprise
      because something *did* happen contrary to expectation. Verb[ても] focuses more on the irrelevance
      of a condition to an outcome, rather than an unfulfilled expectation.
    grammar_point: のに (unexpected result)
  - term: 〜たら
    meaning: if; when
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜たら」 is a general conditional form meaning 'if A, then B' or 'when A, then B.' It does not
      carry the 'even if' or 'no matter what' nuance that Verb[ても] does. With 「〜たら」, B is directly consequent
      to A, whereas with Verb[ても], B occurs *despite* A.
    grammar_point: たら (conditional, when・if A then B)
  - term: 〜ば
    meaning: if
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「〜たら」, 「〜ば」 is a general conditional form. It implies a cause-and-effect relationship
      without the strong concessive 'even if' nuance of Verb[ても].
    grammar_point: ば (conditional, if A then B)
  - term: Verb[ても]いい
    meaning: it's okay to (do); may (do)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Although it contains Verb[ても], this entire phrase functions to grant permission or indicate
      that something is acceptable. The 'も' in this case is part of a fixed expression for permission,
      not a simple concessive 'even if'.
    grammar_point: Verb[て]+もいい (permission)
  - term: 〜ても〜なくても
    meaning: whether or not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This pattern explicitly states two exhaustive possibilities (doing or not doing) and indicates
      that the result is the same regardless. While it uses Verb[ても], its function is to cover both sides
      of a binary condition, whereas simple Verb[ても] focuses on the 'even if' aspect of a single condition.
    grammar_point: 〜ても〜なくても (whether or not)
post_false_friends_writeup: While several expressions can convey a sense of 'if' or 'although,' Verb[ても]
  specifically highlights that the consequence or state is **unaffected** by the condition. Unlike general
  conditionals, it emphasizes the persistence of the outcome despite the preceding action or circumstance.
  When deciding between Verb[ても] and others, consider if you want to stress the 'even if' aspect or if
  you are simply stating a contrast or a straightforward conditional relationship.
examples:
  - english: Even if it rains, the game will continue.
    japanese:
      - 雨 が {降っ て も}、試合 は 続き ます。
      - 雨 が {降っ て も}、試合 は 続く。
    english_literally: Rain falls even if, game continues.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 が 降る と、試合 は 続き ます。
        english: When it rains, the game continues.
        hint: 「と」 indicates a natural or inevitable consequence when a condition is met, without the 'even
          if' nuance of overcoming a condition. We're looking for a concession here.
    scene: A baseball coach is addressing his team before a game, despite dark clouds overhead.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「降って も」 (futte mo) clearly indicates that the rain, a potential impediment, will
      not affect the continuation of the game, emphasizing resilience. The polite form 「続きます」 suits the
      formal context of a coach addressing a team.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly

        english: It's okay if you don't understand, so please ask questions.

        english: If you say no, I will do it.
        hint: 「〜たら」 is a simple conditional, implying 'if A, then B.' It doesn't carry the forceful 'even
          if' nuance of overcoming opposition that 「〜ても」 does. We're looking for that strong concessive
          nuance.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: sympathetic
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「頑張って も」 (ganbatte mo) sets up the concessive condition. The phrase 「うまく いく とは 限りません」 (umaku

    nuance: 「どんな 困難 が あって も」 (donna konnan ga atte mo) combines the interrogative 「どんな」 (what kind of)
      with 「ても」 to express 'no matter what kind of difficulties.' The formal 「乗り越え ます」 (norikoemasu) is
      appropriate for a public address.

      - 早く {寝 て も}、なかなか 眠れ ない。

        english: If I go to bed early, I probably can't fall asleep.

          an action (going to bed early) doesn't lead to the desired outcome.
    scene: Someone complaining about insomnia.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female

      that doesn't yield the expected result. 「なかなか 眠れ ない」 (nakanaka nemurenai) means 'can't easily fall
      asleep,' conveying the struggle with insomnia.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, Verb[ても] is highly versatile. It can be used to
  express a simple concession, 'even if X, then Y,' or, when combined with interrogatives like どこ (where),
  いつ (when), だれ (who), or どんなに (however much), it forms powerful phrases meaning 'no matter where/when/who/how
  much.' Pay attention to the context and the speaker's intent to fully grasp its nuance.
