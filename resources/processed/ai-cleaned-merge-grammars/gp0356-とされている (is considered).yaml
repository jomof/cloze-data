  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: general
  function: Expresses common consensus or widely held belief.
  grammatical-role: Acts as a predicate or part of a predicate, similar to an auxiliary verb, indicating
    a state of being considered or regarded.
  temporal-flow: Used for ongoing states of being considered or for past considerations that have a present
    implication or are being reported as historical fact.
  spatial-flow: Not directly related to spatial flow, but can be used to describe widespread beliefs across
    a region or group of people, implying a conceptual 'space' of shared understanding
etymology: This grammar point is derived from 「する」 (to do), in its passive form 「される」, combined with the
  particle 「と」. 「と」 here indicates that something is *being said*, *thought*, or *considered* in a particular
  way. Thus, 「とされている」 literally translates to "is being done as," but carries the nuance of something
  being widely accepted or considered. The continuous aspect 「ている」 indicates that this state of being
  considered is ongoing or generally true. The etymological roots emphasize a collective action of 'regarding'
  or 'treating as', which evolved into the sense of something being generally accepted or reputed.
writeup: |-
  「とされている」 expresses that something is widely believed, regarded, or considered to be a certain way. It's similar to saying "it is said that..." or "it is considered that...". This grammar point is useful for describing generally accepted facts, beliefs, or common knowledge, emphasizing that a broad consensus exists rather than a personal opinion.

  It is often found in academic writing, news reports, and formal speech, lending an objective or authoritative tone to the statement. While often used in formal contexts, it can also appear in casual conversation when explaining something as common knowledge.

  - term: 思われる (to seem・impersonal)
    meaning: to seem; to appear; to be thought; to be considered
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「とされている」 which conveys a widely accepted belief or consensus, 「思われる」 expresses a personal
      opinion or speculation, implying uncertainty or that it's merely the speaker's conjecture. 「思われる」
      suggests a subjective feeling or impression.
    grammar_point: 思われる (to seem・impersonal)
  - term: ということだ (it means that)
    meaning: It means that; It is said that; I heard that
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ということだ」 indicates information heard from someone else, often a specific source, or a summary
      of something. 「とされている」, on the other hand, expresses something generally accepted or regarded by
      many people, without necessarily pointing to a specific source of information.
    grammar_point: ということだ (it means that)
  - term: ことになっている (expected to; scheduled to)
    meaning: To be expected to, to be scheduled to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ことになっている」 indicates a general rule, a decision, or a convention that has been established,
      often implying an obligation or expectation. It's about what *is supposed to happen* or *is established
      practice*. 「とされている」, on the other hand, describes what is *widely believed or regarded as true*,
      a consensus rather than a rule or schedule.
    grammar_point: ことになっている (expected to; scheduled to)
  - term: と言える (it can be said)
    meaning: Would or could say that...・Can probably say that...・Fair to say that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「と言える」 implies that a statement is justifiable or can reasonably be concluded. It's often
      used to present a speaker's reasoned conclusion or a generally accepted interpretation. While 「とされている」
      also deals with general acceptance, it emphasizes a more established, impersonal consideration or
      reputation, often without the explicit reasoning process implied by 「と言える」. 「と言える」 has a slightly
      more subjective or argumentative tone, whereas 「とされている」 is more descriptive of an existing consensus.
    grammar_point: と言える (it can be said)
post_false_friends_writeup: Be mindful of the subtle differences between 「とされている」, 「思われる」, 「ということだ」, 「ことになっている」,
  and 「と言える」. 「とされている」 implies a widely held belief or general consensus. 「思われる」 expresses personal speculation
  or a subjective impression. 「ということだ」 indicates information from a specific source or a summary of a
  situation. 「ことになっている」 describes established rules or expectations. 「と言える」 conveys a justifiable conclusion
  or reasonable interpretation.

          - 猫 は 夜 で も よく {見える}。
        english: Cats can see well even at night.

          belief or common knowledge.

    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Using 「とされている」 in casual conversation, as a female speaker, suggests sharing a widely accepted
      piece of information or common knowledge rather than stating a personal observation. The phrase
      「見えるとされている」 implies that this fact about cats is generally understood or believed by many, not just
      a claim by the speaker.
    etymology: The concept of cats' night vision being common knowledge is reflected in the use of 「とされている」,
      which implies a shared understanding rather than a newly presented fact. The consensus around this
      belief has been 'established' over time, aligning with the nuance of 'to be regarded as'.

    japanese:

          a collective belief or acceptance.
    scene: You are explaining a local custom to a visitor.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: A male speaker explaining a local custom in a semi-formal context using 「大切だとされている」 emphasizes
      that the summer festival's importance is a widely held, accepted belief within the community, not
      just a personal opinion. It suggests an established understanding.
    etymology: The phrase 「大切だとされている」 indicates a traditional or established importance, aligning with
      the etymological nuance of 「とされている」 as something 'done as' or 'regarded as' by many. This collective
      'regarding' is what makes it a deeply ingrained local understanding.
  - english: That rumor is not yet considered to be true.
    japanese:

      - その うわさ は、まだ 本当 {だ と さ れ て い ない}。

        english: This is a direct statement that the rumor is not true.
        hint: This is a direct statement that the rumor is not true. We're looking for a phrase that indicates
          it's *considered* or *accepted* as true by a general consensus or official confirmation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その うわさ は、まだ 本当 {か どう か} 分かり ませ ん。
        english: This expresses uncertainty based on personal knowledge.
        hint: This expresses uncertainty based on personal knowledge. We're looking for a phrase that
          implies a lack of general acceptance or official confirmation.
    scene: You are discussing unconfirmed information with a colleague.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: When a female speaker uses 「本当だとされていません」 in a semi-formal setting with colleagues, it conveys
      that the rumor lacks widespread acceptance or official confirmation, reflecting a cautious, objective
      stance regarding its veracity. It avoids personal judgment.
    etymology: The negative form 「とされていません」 suggests a lack of common consensus or official recognition,
      which stems from the original meaning of 「とされている」 as something 'done as' or 'regarded as' by many.
      The absence of this collective 'doing' or 'regarding' means it's not accepted as truth.
  - english: In the past, the Earth was considered to be flat.
    japanese:
      - 昔 は、地球 が 平ら {だ と さ れ て い た}。
      - 昔 は、地球 が 平ら {だ と さ れ て い まし た}。

          or *understanding* in the past, not necessarily a factual truth.

          a widely held belief or common knowledge, not just a known fact.

    setting: academic
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group

      a widely held belief or common understanding in the past, without necessarily implying it was factually
      correct. The plain past form suits historical accounts.
    etymology: The past tense 「とされていた」 highlights how a concept was 'considered' or 'regarded' in a historical
      context, emphasizing its status as a past collective understanding rather than a current scientific
      truth. The past 'being done as' refers to how people collectively treated the Earth's shape in that
      era.

        english: This expresses the speaker's personal opinion.
        hint: This expresses the speaker's personal opinion. We're looking for a phrase that conveys a
          generally accepted truth or common wisdom.

    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)

      sleep's importance is a generally accepted fact or common wisdom regarding health, rather than a
      personal recommendation. The polite form is suitable for presentations.
    etymology: The use of 「大切だとされています」 to present common knowledge about health reflects the grammatical
      point's core function of conveying something that is widely 'considered' or 'accepted' as truth,
      stemming from collective human understanding. This implies a historical and ongoing collective 'treatment'
      of sleep as important.

        english: This expresses a lack of belief or perception of unsafety.
        hint: This expresses a lack of belief or perception of unsafety. We're looking for a phrase that
          suggests a lack of general or official consensus on its safety.

    register: casual
    setting: cautious

      is not widely or officially deemed safe, implying a consensus among those who have assessed it,
      rather than just a personal opinion.
    etymology: The negative plain form 「安全だとされていない」 emphasizes that the building 'has not been regarded'
      or 'is not accepted as' safe, highlighting the absence of a collective agreement or judgment on
      its safety, consistent with the grammatical point's origin in expressing collective perception.
      The current state is that it is not 'treated as' safe.
  - english: If he had been considered the culprit, what would have happened?
    japanese:
      - 彼 が 犯人 {だ と さ れ て い たら}、どう なっ て い た だろう？

        english: This sentence directly assumes he was the culprit.
        hint: This sentence directly assumes he was the culprit. We're looking for a phrase that suggests
          a hypothetical situation where someone was widely perceived or deemed as the culprit.
    scene: You are speculating with a friend about the outcome of a past case.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The male speaker using 「犯人だとされていたら」 in a casual, speculative context implies a hypothetical
      scenario where there was a widespread perception or judgment that he was the culprit. This is more
      nuanced than a simple hypothetical assumption of guilt, emphasizing the 'being regarded as' aspect.
    etymology: The conditional form 「とされていたら」 explores a hypothetical situation based on what was 'considered'
      or 'regarded' to be the case, reflecting the underlying meaning of 'being done as' or 'accepted
      as' and its potential outcomes. The focus is on the hypothetical 'treatment' of him as the culprit.

          a phrase that implies a method is widely regarded or accepted as the best.
    scene: You are in a business meeting, discussing strategy.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: negotiating
    conjugation: conditional (～ば)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: In a business negotiation, a male speaker using 「最善だとされていれば」 indicates that the decision to
      use the method is contingent on it being widely accepted or generally deemed as the best, not just
      a personal assessment. The conditional 「～ば」 makes it a strategic consideration.
    etymology: The phrase 「最善だとされていれば」 uses the conditional form of 「とされている」 to mean 'if it is widely
      regarded as the best', emphasizing that a collective opinion or consensus would drive the decision,
      stemming from the grammar point's core meaning of general acceptance. It means 'if it is 'treated
      as' the best by others'.

    japanese:

    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: When a female speaker reflects on a past project, using 「成功するとされていました」 conveys that the plan
      was widely expected or generally believed to succeed, setting up a contrast with the actual, differing
      outcome. This nuance of collective expectation is key.
    etymology: The polite past tense 「とされていました」 implies that a plan was 'regarded as' or 'expected to
      be' successful by many at a certain point in the past. This reflects the nuance of general acceptance
      or belief, which is then contrasted with a different reality. The plan was 'treated as' successful
      prior to its completion.

          a collective belief or acceptance.

    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: A male doctor using 「効くとされている」 in a semi-formal, informative context conveys that the herb's
      effectiveness for headaches is a widely accepted traditional belief or common knowledge, without
      necessarily claiming it as a proven scientific fact.
    etymology: The use of 「効くとされている」 in this context highlights how the efficacy of traditional remedies
      is often conveyed as established collective knowledge, rather than empirically proven scientific
      fact, reflecting the core meaning of 'being widely regarded'. The herb has been 'treated as' effective
      for a long time.
post_example_writeup: When using 「とされている」, remember that you're conveying a widely held belief, not necessarily
  a proven fact. It's a useful phrase for sharing common knowledge or stating generally accepted ideas
  without claiming absolute truth.
