    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「だけあって」 is composed of 「だけ」 (dake), meaning \"only\" or \"just,\" and 「あって」 (atte), which is the te-form of the verb 「ある」 (aru), meaning \"to be.\" Therefore, the literal sense is akin to \"just being (A), (B) happens as a result\". This structure emphasizes that the positive outcome (B) is a natural consequence of the defining characteristic or condition (A).",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「だけあって」 is used to convey that something is natural, expected, or justified because of a particular reason, condition, or characteristic. It highlights that given a certain attribute or situation, a specific positive outcome is not surprising. It is often translated as \"as might be expected,\" \"being the case,\" or \"because.\" This pattern is distinct from simple causal expressions like 「から」 or 「ので」 because it carries a nuance of justification and expectedness. It is particularly used when the outcome is seen as a positive or commendable consequence of the preceding condition.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that 「だけあって」 should only be used when the reason or result is considered positive or a justifiable outcome. It implies that the innate trait or characteristic of the subject (A) logically led to the positive result (B). For instance, if someone is a professional athlete, it is only natural (expected) that they are physically strong. You would use 「だけあって」 in such a context.\n\nThis structure can be attached to informal forms of verbs and い-adjectives. For な-adjectives, it typically follows the stem plus 「な」. For nouns, it directly follows the noun, sometimes with 「だけあって」 or 「なだけあって」 depending on the noun's function.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Positive Outcomes Only**: Unlike some other causal expressions, 「だけあって」 strictly applies to situations where the result is positive, expected, or justifiable. It cannot be used for negative outcomes.\n*   **Existing Conditions**: It emphasizes an innate or established quality. Therefore, it is generally not used for things that are not yet certain or that may happen in the future. Expressions of uncertainty like 「だろう」, 「でしょう」, or 「かもしれない」 are typically not used with 「だけあって」.",
