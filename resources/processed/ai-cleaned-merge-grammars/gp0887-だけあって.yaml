    "etymology": "The grammar point 「だけあって」 is composed of 「だけ」 (dake), meaning \"only\" or \"just,\" and 「あって」 (atte), which is the te-form of the verb 「ある」 (aru), meaning \"to be.\" Therefore, the literal sense is akin to \"just being (A), (B) happens as a result\".",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「だけあって」 is used to express that something is natural, expected, or justified because of a certain reason, condition, or characteristic. It conveys the idea that because of a particular attribute or situation, a specific outcome is not surprising. It's similar to 「だけに」. However, it's crucial to note that 「だけあって」 should only be used with positive reasons or results. Avoid using it in contexts where the reason or outcome is negative.",
