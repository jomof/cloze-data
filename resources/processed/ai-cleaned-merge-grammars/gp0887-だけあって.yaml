    "etymology": "The grammar point 「だけあって」 is derived from 「だけ」 (dake, meaning 'only' or 'just') and the te-form of the verb 「ある」 (aru, meaning 'to be'). The combination suggests that 'just by being' something, a certain result is naturally expected.",
    "writeup": "「だけあって」 expresses that something is \"only natural for (A)\" or \"as might be expected of (A).\" It implies that because of (A)'s inherent traits or qualities, the outcome (B) is predictable and positive. It is similar to 「だけに」. \n\n*   The structure is 「Aだけあって、B」, where B is a positive consequence or result related to A.\n*   It emphasizes an intrinsic quality of A, so it's not used for uncertain future events or with expressions like 「だろう」 or 「かもしれない」.\n*   「だけあって」 can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (followed by な), or nouns.",
