    "writeup": "「末(に)」 (sue ni) is used to express that something happens after a considerable amount of time, effort, or deliberation. It indicates a result achieved after a process. It's similar to saying \"after,\" \"in the end,\" or \"as a result of\" in English, but with an emphasis on the preceding period or effort. It is a more formal expression, often found in written Japanese or formal speech. It's **important** to note that 「末に」 implies a process or period leading up to the result, suggesting that the conclusion was not easy or immediate.",
