    "etymology": "「折(おり)」, originally meaning \"fold\" or \"pleat,\" is used here to denote a specific \"occasion,\" \"time,\" or \"opportunity.\" When combined with the particle 「に」, it functions adverbially, indicating the time *when* something occurs or an opportunity arises. The addition of 「は」, though often omitted, adds a subtle emphasis to that specific time or occasion.",
    "writeup": "「折には (ori ni wa)」 is a formal and somewhat stiff expression used to denote a specific **time or occasion** that presents itself as an opportunity. It is often translated as 'on the occasion of (A)', 'when the chance of (A) comes up', or simply 'when'.\n\nWhile grammatically similar to 「時に (toki ni)」, 「折には」 carries a more formal and often anticipatory nuance, suggesting a particular opportunity that is either welcomed or anticipated. It can imply a positive or beneficial event, though it is not exclusively limited to such situations. The usage is considered quite formal (硬い).\n\nThis expression typically connects to nouns followed by 「の」 or verbs in their dictionary form. Although commonly seen as 「折には」, the particle 「は」 is frequently omitted, leaving 「折に」, which maintains the same meaning and formality.\n\nIt is important to note that 「折には」 is often used for events or circumstances that recur or might arise repeatedly (e.g., 'when you come to Japan,' which could happen multiple times), rather than strictly one-off, unique occurrences. However, it can also refer to a specific, unique past event that served as an important occasion.\n\n### Related Expressions\nJapanese features several fixed expressions using 「折」 that convey slightly different nuances:\n*   **折に触れて (ori ni furete)**: 'Whenever the occasion arises,' 'from time to time,' or 'always when prompted by the occasion.' This implies a recurring action triggered by a particular circumstance.\n*   **折があれば (ori ga areba)**: 'If there is an opportunity/chance.' Expresses a conditional possibility.\n*   **折を見て (ori o mite)**: 'When the time is right,' 'when conditions are favorable.' Suggests waiting for an opportune moment.\n*   **折も折 (ori mo ori)**: 'At that very moment,' 'at the critical juncture.' Emphasizes the precise timing of an event, often implying coincidence or a turning point.",
