jlpt: N5
etymology: 'The adverb 「よく」 originates from the い-adjective 「良い (yoi)」, meaning ''good.'' In classical
  Japanese, い-adjectives formed their adverbial form by changing the final い to く, thus 「よく」 meant ''in
  a good way'' or ''well.'' This historical connection explains its diverse uses: from meaning ''well''
  (as in doing something skillfully or thoroughly) to ''often'' (implying a ''good'' or frequent occurrence),
  or even ''very'' (to a ''good'' degree, though this usage is less common in modern Japanese, with 「とても」
  being more prevalent for simple intensification).'
writeup: The adverb 「よく」 is a versatile word in Japanese with several key meanings, primarily revolving
  around frequency, quality, and thoroughness.When expressing **frequency**, 「よく」 means 'often' or 'frequently.'
  It indicates that an action or event occurs many times or regularly. For example, 「よく食べる」 means 'to
  eat often.'It can also describe the **quality** or **manner** in which an action is performed, translating
  to 'well,' 'skillfully,' or ' nicely.' In this sense, it implies a satisfactory or proficient execution.
  For instance, 「よくできた」 can mean 'it was done well' or 'it was completed nicely.' This usage often carries
  a sense of accomplishment or approval.Furthermore, 「よく」 can convey **thoroughness** or **completeness**,
  meaning 'properly,' 'carefully,' or 'completely.' This nuance suggests attention to detail and ensuring
  something is done to a full extent. An example would be 「よく考える」 meaning 'to think carefully/thoroughly.'While
  less common in modern colloquial Japanese for simple intensification, 「よく」 can sometimes convey a sense
  of 'very' or 'quite' when emphasizing a degree, especially in set phrases or literary contexts, though
  「とても」 is generally preferred for this purpose.Understanding the context and the verb/adjective it modifies
  is crucial for correctly interpreting 「よく」, as its meaning shifts subtly between these interconnected
  senses derived from its root in 'goodness.'

  - term: いつも
    meaning: always, usually
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いつも」 implies a continuous or near-constant state or action, suggesting a higher frequency
      or habitual nature than 「よく」. While 「よく」 indicates 'often,' 「いつも」 is closer to 'always' or 'every
      time.'
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:いつも (always・usually)
  - term: たびたび
    meaning: frequently, often
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たびたび」 is a more formal or literary equivalent of 「よく」 (meaning 'often'). It often implies
      a somewhat irregular or noticeable frequency, whereas 「よく」 can be more general. 「たびたび」 might be
      used in more formal reports or speeches.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:たびたび (frequently)
  - term: ちゃんと
    meaning: properly, neatly, exactly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: When 「よく」 means 'thoroughly' or 'properly,' it overlaps with 「ちゃんと」. However, 「ちゃんと」 emphasizes
      correctness, precision, or adherence to a standard, often implying responsibility or carefulness.
      「よく」 can also mean 'well done' in a general sense, without necessarily implying strict adherence
      to rules.
    grammar_point: ちゃんと・きちんと (properly・neatly)
  - term: とても
    meaning: very, extremely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「よく」 can sometimes imply 'very' (e.g., 「よく似ている」 - 'very similar'), 「とても」 is the standard
      adverb for expressing a high degree or intensity. 「よく」 as 'very' is more limited and often combined
      with specific verbs/adjectives, whereas 「とても」 is broadly applicable for intensification.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:とても (very)
post_false_friends_writeup: When differentiating 「よく」 from similar expressions, consider the specific
  nuance. 「いつも」 (always) signifies a higher degree of constancy than 「よく」 (often). For formality, 「たびたび」
  can often replace 「よく」 when discussing frequency. If you want to convey that something was done 'properly'
  or 'correctly' with an emphasis on adherence to a standard, 「ちゃんと」 is generally more precise than 「よく」.
  Lastly, while 「よく」 can occasionally imply intensity, 「とても」 is the standard and more broadly applicable
  adverb for expressing 'very' or 'extremely'.

          - 彼 は いつ も 夜更かし し ます。

    scene: Friends talking about a mutual acquaintance's habits.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: While literally "often stays up late," the nuance of 「よく」 here can also subtly imply that
      it's something he's accustomed to doing, or perhaps even 'good' at in the sense of frequently managing
      to do it. This ties back to the etymological root of 'good'.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, the context is key to discerning the precise meaning of
  「よく」. Whether it's about frequency, quality, or thoroughness, 「よく」 consistently points to a positive
  or significant characteristic of the action or state.
