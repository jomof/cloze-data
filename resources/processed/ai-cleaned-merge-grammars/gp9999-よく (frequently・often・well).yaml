details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Describes the frequency or quality of actions, the clarity of perception, or the thoroughness
    of an action. Can also be used in exclamatory expressions.
  function: Modifies verbs, adjectives, or entire phrases.
  nuance: Can imply regularity (often), competence (well, skillfully), thoroughness (properly, completely),
    or clear perception (clearly). In exclamations, it conveys surprise, admiration, or exasperation.
  counterpoint: めったに〜ない (rarely), あまり ない (not very or much)
  colocation: Frequently used with verbs like 食べる (taberu), 寝る (neru), 読む (yomu), わかる (wakaru), 見える (mieru),
    聞こえる (kikoeru), and する (suru).
etymology: The word よく is the adverbial form of the adjective 良い (yoi), which means “good” or “fine.”
  In classical Japanese, the adverbial form of い-adjectives was formed by changing the final い to く. Thus,
  良き (yoki) became 良く (yoku). Over time, this よく evolved to carry not just the meaning of “in a good way”
  but also extended to denote frequency (“a good number of times”) and thoroughness (“to a good extent”).
  This historical connection to “good” explains its versatile usage across quality, frequency, and degree.
writeup: 'よく is a remarkably versatile and frequently used adverb in Japanese, derived from the adverbial
  form of the adjective 良い (yoi), meaning “good.” This etymological root explains its diverse applications
  across various contexts, often conveying a sense of “goodness” in different aspects. It primarily functions
  in three main ways: 1. **Frequency (often, frequently):** This is perhaps its most common usage. It
  indicates that an action or event occurs many times or regularly. Think of it as “a good number of times.”
  For example, 彼は{よく}本を読みます。(He reads books often.) 2. **Quality/Skill (well, skillfully):** Here, よく
  describes the manner in which an action is performed, implying a high degree of competence or proficiency.
  It’s akin to saying “in a good way.” For example, 彼女は料理が{よく}できます。(She can cook well.) 3. **Degree/Thoroughness
  (thoroughly, precisely, clearly):** よく can also emphasize the extent or thoroughness of an action or
  state. It signifies that something is done completely or perceived clearly. For example, その問題を{よく}考えてください。(Please
  think about that problem thoroughly.) Or, 山頂から街が{よく}見える。(The town can be seen clearly from the mountaintop.)
  Additionally, よく can be used in exclamatory expressions to convey surprise, admiration, or even exasperation.
  For instance, よくやった！(Yoku yatta!) means “Well done!” while よくもそんなことが言えるね！(Yoku mo sonna koto ga ieru
  ne!) can convey “How dare you say such a thing!” or “You’ve got a lot of nerve saying that!” This rhetorical
  use often carries a strong emotional tone. Understanding the core meaning of “goodly” or “in a good
  way” helps unify these seemingly disparate usages, making よく a nuanced and essential part of everyday
  Japanese.'

  - term: めったに〜ない (rarely)
    meaning: Rarely, seldom, hardly
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike よく which denotes high frequency, めったに〜ない (used with a negative verb) expresses very
      low frequency. We're looking for an adverb that indicates actions that occur often or well.
    grammar_point: めったに〜ない (rarely)
  - term: ちゃんと・きちんと (properly・neatly)
    meaning: Properly, neatly, orderly, sufficiently
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While ちゃんと and きちんと also mean 'properly' or 'neatly,' they often imply adherence to rules
      or expectations. よく is broader and can describe general skill or clarity (e.g., よく見える - can see
      clearly), beyond just 'correct' execution.
    grammar_point: ちゃんと・きちんと (properly・neatly)
  - term: 全く〜ない (not at all)
    meaning: Not ~ at all
    kind: antonym
    nuance: まったく〜ない is a strong negative, meaning 'not at all.' This contrasts with よく's meanings of 'often'
      or 'well,' indicating a complete absence or poor quality of action. We're looking for something
      done frequently or skillfully.
    grammar_point: 全く〜ない (not at all)
post_false_friends_writeup: While よく can refer to frequency (often) or quality (well), it's important
  to distinguish it from other adverbs. For frequency, めったに〜ない (used with a negative verb) means “rarely”
  or “seldom,” serving as a direct opposite. When よく refers to quality or thoroughness, ちゃんと and きちんと
  are close synonyms, both meaning “properly” or “neatly.” However, よく is broader and can describe skill
  or clarity (e.g., よく見える - “can see clearly”), while ちゃんと and きちんと often imply adherence to rules or
  expectations. まったく〜ない is a strong intensifier for negation, indicating a complete absence or severe
  deficiency, contrasting sharply with both the frequency and quality senses of よく.

    japanese:
      - 納豆 は {よく} 食べる よ。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 納豆 は {毎日} 食べる よ。
        english: I eat natto every day.
        hint: 「毎日」means 'every day,' indicating absolute regularity, whereas we're looking for 'often,'
          which implies high but not necessarily daily frequency.
    scene: A friend asks about your eating habits at a casual get-together.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The casual 「よ」 particle reinforces the speaker's personal experience of frequently eating
      natto. 「納豆は{よく}食べるよ」is a straightforward statement of habit.
