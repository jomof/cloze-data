meaning: a state has continued unchanged ever since an action, or remaining in a certain posture/state
pronunciation:
  katakana: タナリ・ナリ
  romaji: tanari・nari
formation:
  Verb[た形] + なり: Indicates that the subject remained in a state or posture immediately after performing
    the verb's action, or that a situation has remained unchanged since then. Often carries a nuance of
    unexpectedness or being left unattended.
jlpt: N2
etymology: The particle 「なり」 in this context is thought to have evolved from 「にあり」 (ni ari), meaning 'to
  be in' or 'to exist in a state'. This origin highlights its core meaning of maintaining a state or position
  after an action, emphasizing the immediate and continuous nature of the resulting condition. It signifies
  'just as it is' or 'remaining in that state'.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point **たなり** (V-た形 + なり) is used to express that an action was performed, and the subject (or something related to the action) has remained in that specific state or posture ever since. It conveys a strong sense of continuity, often implying that the state was maintained immediately after the preceding action, or that something was left unattended.

  While similar to **V-たまま**, **たなり** often carries a nuance of abruptness, a fixed position, or sometimes a slight negative connotation of being left as is, or an unexpected persistence. It's typically used with verbs that describe a short, instantaneous action or a change in posture, such as standing, sitting, closing, or leaving.

  For example, if someone sat down (座った) and **座ったなり** implies they remained seated, perhaps unexpectedly or without moving, contrasting with just being seated (座ったまま) which is more neutral. It's a slightly more formal or literary expression than **まま**.

  - term: Verb[た形] + まま
    meaning: as is; remaining in a state
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「まま」is a neutral expression for remaining in a state or keeping something as it is. 「たなり」
      often implies a more abrupt continuation or something being left unattended.

  - term: Verb[た形] + きり
    meaning: since; only
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「きり」 emphasizes that nothing else has happened since the action, or that only that action
      occurred. 「たなり」 focuses on the continuation of the state that resulted from the action.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-た]きり (since・no change)'
  - term: Verb[る形] + なり Verb[る形]
    meaning: as soon as... then...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This 「なり」 expresses immediate succession between two actions, meaning 'as soon as X happens,
      Y happens.' It is a different grammatical usage from 「たなり」, which describes a continuous state after
      an action.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-た] とたん(に)・が早いか・や否や・なり (as soon as)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「たなり」, 「まま」, and 「きり」 all describe continuous states or actions, their
  nuances differ significantly. 「まま」 is the most neutral, simply stating a state. 「きり」 emphasizes the
  exclusivity or finality of an action or state. 「たなり」 often highlights an unexpected or static continuation,
  sometimes with an implication of being left in that state.
