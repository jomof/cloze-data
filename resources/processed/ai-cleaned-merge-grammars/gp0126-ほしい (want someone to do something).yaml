    "meaning": "To want someone to do something",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Varies depending on the politeness level of 'ほしい'.",
        "Limitations": "Generally not used when the person you want to do something is of higher status."
    },
    "etymology": "The adjective 「ほしい」 originally means \"wanted\" or \"desired.\" When attached to the te-form of a verb, it expresses the speaker's desire for someone else to perform that action. It's a relatively direct way of expressing a wish or expectation.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point expresses that the speaker wants someone to do something. The particle に marks the person from whom the action is desired. It's crucial to remember that 「ほしい」 is generally not used when the person you're addressing or referring to is of higher status. Using it in such cases can sound demanding or disrespectful. For seniors, use 「もらいたい」 or other more polite alternatives.",
