        "usage-context": "This grammar point describes actions performed for the speaker or their in-group. While the base verb くれる has plain and polite forms (くれる and くれます), the concept of receiving a favor itself can be expressed in various registers depending on the social context and who is performing the action.",
        "function": "To indicate a favor or beneficial action performed by someone for the speaker or a member of the speaker's in-group.",
        "nuance": "Expresses gratitude or appreciation from the speaker's perspective for the received action.",
        "source": "DOJG",
        "grammatical-role": "Auxiliary Verb",
        "logical-flow": "Action by A (giver) → Benefit to B (receiver, speaker/in-group)",
        "temporal-flow": "Action occurs, then benefit is received.",
        "spatial-flow": "Action 'flows' towards the speaker's side (in-group)."
    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「くれる」 (kureru) originates from the Old Japanese verb 「くす」 (kusu), which indicated an action given 'downward' or 'inward' towards the speaker or their immediate group. This historical sense of directionality is central to its modern usage, emphasizing a benefit received by the speaker or someone within their personal sphere.",
    "writeup": "**くれる (kureru)** is used as an auxiliary verb with the て (te) form of another verb, signifying that someone performs an action as a favor or benefit specifically for the speaker or for someone within the speaker's in-group (e.g., family, close friends). This grammar point inherently expresses a sense of gratitude or appreciation from the speaker's perspective for the action received. Unlike other verbs of giving, くれる emphasizes the direction of the action *towards* the speaker or their associated circle. This directionality is fundamental to its usage, making it unsuitable for actions performed for outsiders or those outside the speaker's empathic sphere.",
