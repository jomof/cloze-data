    "formation": {
        "Verb (て-form) + くれる": "Someone does something for me or someone closely related to me."
    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「くれる」 (kureru) originates from the Old Japanese verb 「くす」 (kusu), which indicated an action given 'downward' or 'inward' towards the speaker or their immediate group. This historical sense of directionality is central to its modern usage, emphasizing a benefit received by the speaker or someone within their personal sphere.",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Generally used in informal and formal settings.",
        "Who benefits?": "The speaker or someone closely associated with the speaker (e.g., family member, close friend).",
        "Direction of favor": "The action is done *for* the speaker or their in-group."
    },
    "writeup": "**くれる (kureru)** is used as an auxiliary verb with the て (te) form of another verb, signifying that someone performs an action as a favor or benefit specifically for the speaker or for someone within the speaker's in-group (e.g., family, close friends). This grammar point inherently expresses a sense of gratitude or appreciation from the speaker's perspective for the action received. Unlike other verbs of giving, くれる emphasizes the direction of the action *towards* the speaker or their associated circle. This directionality is fundamental to its usage, making it unsuitable for actions performed for outsiders or those outside the speaker's empathic sphere.",
