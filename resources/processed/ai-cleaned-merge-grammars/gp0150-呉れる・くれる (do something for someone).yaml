jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: This grammar point describes actions performed for the speaker or their in-group. While
    the base verb くれる has plain and polite forms (くれる and くれます), the concept of receiving a favor itself
    can be expressed in various registers depending on the social context and who is performing the action.
  function: To indicate a favor or beneficial action performed by someone for the speaker or a member
    of the speaker's in-group.
  nuance: Expresses gratitude or appreciation from the speaker's perspective for the received action.
  grammatical-role: Auxiliary Verb
  logical-flow: Action by A (giver) → Benefit to B (receiver, speaker/in-group)
  temporal-flow: Action occurs, then benefit is received.
  spatial-flow: Action 'flows' towards the speaker's side (in-group). Does not imply physical movement,
    but rather a conceptual transfer of benefit.
etymology: The verb 「くれる」 (kureru) originates from the Old Japanese verb 「くす」 (kusu), meaning 'to give'.
  Its sense of directionality, indicating an action given 'downward' or 'inward' towards the speaker or
  their immediate group, is central to its modern usage. This highlights a benefit received by the speaker
  or someone within their personal sphere.
writeup: '**くれる (kureru)** is used as an auxiliary verb with the て (te) form of another verb, signifying
  that someone performs an action as a favor or benefit specifically for the speaker or for someone within
  the speaker''s in-group (e.g., family, close friends). This grammar point inherently expresses a sense
  of gratitude or appreciation from the speaker''s perspective for the action received. Unlike other verbs
  of giving, くれる emphasizes the direction of the action *towards* the speaker or their associated circle.
  This directionality is fundamental to its usage, making it unsuitable for actions performed for outsiders
  or those outside the speaker''s empathic sphere.'
false_friends:
  - term: あげる
    meaning: to give (to someone of lower status, or no status)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While くれる means someone does something *for* you (or your in-group), あげる means you do something
      *for* someone else (usually someone of lower status or no status).
    grammar_point: あげる (give away)
  - term: もらう
    meaning: to receive
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While くれる focuses on the giver's action, もらう focuses on the receiver's perspective. You 「もらう」
      something that someone 「くれる」.
    grammar_point: もらう (to receive)
  - term: いただく
    meaning: to humbly receive
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いただく」 can be used instead of 「もらう」 to show humbleness toward the giver of the favor.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:いただく (to humbly receive)
post_false_friends_writeup: It's important to remember the direction of the action when using くれる, あげる,
  and もらう. くれる is always about someone doing something for you (or someone in your in-group). あげる is about
  you doing something for someone else. もらう is about you receiving something.

      on them. This shows that the 'in-group' perspective can extend to anyone who performs a helpful
      action for the speaker.

post_example_writeup: 'As you can see from these examples, the core meaning of くれる is consistently maintained:
  someone is performing an action that benefits the speaker or someone within the speaker''s close circle.
  The specific nuance and politeness level change with conjugation and context, but the underlying direction
  of the favor remains constant. Pay close attention to who is benefiting from the action to correctly
  use くれる versus other verbs of giving and receiving.'
