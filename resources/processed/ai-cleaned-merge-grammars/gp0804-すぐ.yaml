    "etymology": "The origin of 「すぐ」 is not definitively known, but it is believed to have evolved from older Japanese words implying closeness or directness. Its meaning has remained relatively consistent over time, referring to the lack of interval, either in time or space.",
    "writeup": "「すぐ」 is a versatile adverb in Japanese that primarily conveys the sense of immediacy or proximity. It can be translated as \"immediately,\" \"right away,\" \"soon,\" or \"easily,\" depending on the specific context.\n\nWhen modifying a verb, 「すぐ」 indicates that an action occurs without delay. For example, 「家に帰ったらすぐご飯を食べる」 (I eat dinner as soon as I get home) implies a direct, prompt transition from arriving home to eating. This usage emphasizes the lack of temporal distance between two events.\n\nAlternatively, 「すぐ」 can describe spatial proximity, indicating that something is \"right there\" or \"very close.\" For instance, 「学校は駅のすぐそばです」 (The school is right next to the station) highlights the minimal physical distance between the school and the station. This usage emphasizes the lack of physical distance.\n\nFurthermore, 「すぐ」 can describe the ease with which something happens, implying that an action is readily accomplished or that someone easily exhibits a certain trait. For instance, 「彼はすぐ怒る」 (He easily gets angry) means that it doesn't take much for him to become angry.\n\nIt is widely used across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal settings, making it an essential word for expressing promptness, closeness, or effortlessness in daily Japanese communication.",
