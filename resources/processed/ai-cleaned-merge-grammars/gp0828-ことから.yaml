        "function": "To present a clear and logical cause-and-effect relationship, where the preceding clause provides the factual basis for the subsequent conclusion.",
        "nuance": "This construction emphasizes that the conclusion or consequence is derived *from* the preceding factual statement. The particle 「から」 acts as a case-marking particle, indicating the origin or source of the reason. It is more objective and analytical than simply using 「から」 or 「ので」 as conjunctions for a reason."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことから」 is composed of the noun 「こと」 (koto), meaning 'matter,' 'thing,' or 'fact,' and the particle 「から」 (kara), meaning 'from.' Therefore, it literally translates to 'from the matter/fact.' Over time, its usage evolved to succinctly express a reason or cause derived directly from a specific fact or situation, lending it a formal and objective tone.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ことから」 is employed to clearly state a reason or cause, based on a concrete fact or situation, that leads to a logical conclusion or inference. It conveys the sense of \"from the fact that (A), therefore (B)\" or \"given that (A), (B) occurs/is inferred.\" This construction is generally used in more formal settings, such as news reports, academic discussions, or when providing explanations that require a degree of objectivity.\n\nIt attaches to verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns, all in their plain (dictionary or informal) forms. For な-adjectives and nouns, 「な」 or 「である」 is often inserted before 「ことから」. The inclusion of 「である」 or 「だった」 (the past form of 「である」) adds to the formality.\n\n**Important Distinction: 「ことから」 vs. 「ことだから」**\nIt is crucial to differentiate 「ことから」 from 「ことだから」. While both express a reason, their underlying functions are distinct.\n\n*   **「ことから」**: Here, 「から」 functions as a case-marking particle, indicating the source or origin of the reason. It points to an observable fact as the foundation for a conclusion. It emphasizes a direct, logical cause-and-effect. Think of it as **\"from the fact that...\"**\n    *   Example: 子供が急に静かになった**ことから**、何か悪いことをしていると分かった。(From the fact that the child suddenly became quiet, I knew they were doing something bad.) The quietness is the *source* of the realization.\n\n*   **「ことだから」**: In this construction, 「から」 acts as a conjunctive particle, linking clauses to express a reason based on a person's inherent nature, characteristic habit, or a known condition. It suggests an expected outcome given a typical pattern. Think of it as **\"because it's (someone/something's) nature/usual behavior...\"**\n    *   Example: 彼のこと**だから**、きっと成功するだろう。(Because it's him/he's like that, he will surely succeed.) His character is the *reason* for the expectation of success.\n\nUnderstanding this subtle difference in the function of 「から」 is key to correctly applying each grammar point. 「ことから」 serves to highlight the factual basis from which an objective conclusion is drawn.",

With 「ことだから」, 「から」 is a conjunctive particle used to state a reason based on a person's known character, habits, or typical behavior, implying an expected outcome due to their nature. It's less about objective fact and more about personal attributes."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate 「ことから」 from similar expressions, remember its core function: establishing a direct, objective causal link from a specific fact. If you are drawing a conclusion *from* an observable situation or an established truth, 「ことから」 is likely the appropriate choice. When expressing a judgment *based on* a specific example or a viewpoint, or when the reason stems from someone's inherent nature or usual actions, then other expressions like 「からして」 or 「ことだから」 might be more suitable. Always consider whether the reason you are providing is an objective fact or a subjective characteristic.",
