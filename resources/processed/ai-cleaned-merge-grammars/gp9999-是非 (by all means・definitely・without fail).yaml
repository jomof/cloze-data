etymology: 'The word 「是非」 is a compound of two kanji: 「是」 (ze), meaning "right" or "correct," and 「非」
  (hi), meaning "wrong" or "incorrect." Historically, this combination referred to the distinction between
  right and wrong, as in "right and wrong" or "pros and cons." Over time, its usage evolved. When used
  as an adverb, it came to mean "by all means" or "without fail," implying that something is "right" or
  "correct" to do, or that it is "unquestionably" so. This evolution from a concept of moral judgment
  to one of strong affirmation or necessity is quite interesting. It suggests that if something is "right
  or wrong," then doing the "right" thing is something one should "definitely" do.'
writeup: 「是非」 is an adverb used to express a strong desire, invitation, suggestion, or a firm intention.
  It translates most closely to "by all means," "definitely," or "without fail." It conveys an earnest
  and enthusiastic tone, often used when encouraging someone to do something or when expressing your own
  strong wish.When used with requests or invitations, 「是非」 adds a sense of sincere eagerness. For example,
  if you say 「是非来てください」, it's not just "Please come," but "Please *definitely* come" or "Please come *by
  all means*." It makes the invitation sound more heartfelt and less like a mere formality.It can also
  be used to express the speaker's own strong intention or hope. For instance, 「是非行きたいです」 means "I *definitely*
  want to go" or "I *really* want to go." This conveys a personal commitment or a strong wish.「是非」 does
  not change its form and can be used with various verb forms, typically volitional, imperative, or desiderative
  forms, as well as polite forms like -たいです or -てください. While it can be used in both casual and formal
  settings, its presence always adds emphasis and earnestness.It is important to note that while 「是非」
  implies certainty or a strong positive inclination, it is generally used for actions or desires that
  are within the realm of possibility. It's less about a strict obligation and more about enthusiastic
  encouragement or strong personal will.

  - term: 必ず
    meaning: surely; without fail; certainly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「必ず」 conveys a higher degree of objective certainty or obligation. It emphasizes that something
      *will* happen or *must* happen, often due to a rule, promise, or natural law. It's more factual
      and less emotional than 「是非」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:必ず (surely・without fail)
  - term: きっと
    meaning: surely; undoubtedly; almost certainly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「きっと」 expresses the speaker's strong conviction or strong expectation about something. It's
      subjective certainty. While strong, it's still about the speaker's belief, whereas 「是非」 is about
      a strong desire or encouragement.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:きっと (surely・undoubtedly)
  - term: どうしても
    meaning: by all means; no matter what; after all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どうしても」 indicates a strong will or an unavoidable necessity, often implying that there are
      obstacles or difficulties to overcome, or that something is the final, unchangeable conclusion.
      It can express a strong "I must do this" even in the face of challenges. 「是非」 emphasizes earnestness
      and desire; 「どうしても」 emphasizes overcoming hurdles.
    grammar_point: どうしても (inevitably or absolutely)
  - term: ぜひとも
    meaning: by all means; absolutely (even stronger emphasis than 是非)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ぜひとも」 is a more emphatic version of 「是非」, adding a further layer of earnestness or strong
      determination. It is often used in slightly more formal or emphatic contexts than 「是非」 alone.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ぜひとも (by all means・absolutely)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「是非」, 「必ず」, 「きっと」, and 「どうしても」 can all translate to "definitely" or
  "surely" in English, their nuances differ significantly. 「是非」 conveys a strong personal desire or a
  warm, earnest invitation, focusing on the speaker's enthusiasm or encouraging the listener. 「必ず」, on
  the other hand, implies a high degree of objective certainty or a strict obligation, indicating that
  something *will* happen or *must* be done without fail, regardless of desire. 「きっと」 expresses the speaker's
  strong personal conviction or prediction, based on their belief. Lastly, 「どうしても」 is used when there's
  a strong, perhaps unavoidable, need or desire, often suggesting that effort is required to overcome
  obstacles, or that something is a final, determined outcome. 「ぜひとも」 is simply a more emphatic version
  of 「是非」, adding an extra layer of earnestness. Understanding these subtle differences is key to using
  them appropriately in Japanese.
