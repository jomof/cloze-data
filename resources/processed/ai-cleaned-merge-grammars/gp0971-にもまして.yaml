    "etymology": "にもまして is derived from the particle に, the adverbial particle も meaning \"even\", and the て-form of the verb 増す (masu, \"to increase\"). Thus, it literally means \"even increasing from.\" ",
    "writeup": "にもまして is used to express that something has surpassed a certain level, especially when it had been at a consistent level previously. It often translates to \"even more than (A), (B)\" or \"more than ever.\"  The に marks the noun (A) as the point of comparison, from which 増す indicates an increase or growth. This pattern frequently follows words like 誰 (dare, \"who\"), 何 (nani, \"what\"), or いつ (itsu, \"when\"), in which case (A) is expressed as \"anyone,\" \"anything,\" or \"ever.\"",
