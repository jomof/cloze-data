    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にもまして」 is derived from 「に」 (particle indicating direction or comparison), 「も」 (particle indicating 'even'), and the te-form of the verb 「増す」 (masu), which means \"to increase\". So, literally, it means \"even increasing from\".",
    "writeup": "「にもまして」 is used to express that something has surpassed a certain level or standard, especially when that thing was already at a consistent level. It indicates an increase or growth from a previous state. Common translations include \"more than ever\" or \"even more than\". It is made up of the particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「も」 (\"even\"), and the te-form of the verb 「増す」 (\"to increase\"). 「に」 marks the noun that is used as the point of comparison from which 「増す」 indicates an increase or growth. This pattern often follows words like 「誰」 (\"who\"), 「何」 (\"what\"), or 「いつ」 (\"when\"). In these cases, the grammar point is being used to express \"anyone\", \"anything\", or \"ever\", rather than something more specific.",
