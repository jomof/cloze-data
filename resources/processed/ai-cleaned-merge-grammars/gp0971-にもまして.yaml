    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にもまして」 is derived from 「に」 (particle indicating direction or comparison), 「も」 (particle indicating 'even'), and the te-form of the verb 「増す」 (masu), which means \"to increase\". So, literally, it means \"even increasing from\".",
    "writeup": "「にもまして」 is used to express that something has surpassed a certain level or standard, particularly when it indicates a significant increase or growth from a previous state. Its core meaning conveys *surpassing* or *exceeding* a prior state or comparison point. This construction is formed by combining the particle 「に」 (indicating comparison or basis), the adverbial particle 「も」 (meaning \"even\"), and the te-form of the verb 「増す」 (masu), which means \"to increase\". Thus, it literally translates to \"even increasing from (A), (B)\". The particle 「に」 attaches to the noun serving as the comparison point. This pattern frequently appears with indefinite pronouns like 「誰」 (\"who\"), 「何」 (\"what\"), or 「いつ」 (\"when\"), in which cases it conveys \"anyone\", \"anything\", or \"ever\" respectively, emphasizing an exceptional degree.",

It carries a nuance of exceeding what was already significant.",
