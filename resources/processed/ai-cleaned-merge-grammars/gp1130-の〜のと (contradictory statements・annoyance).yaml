jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  function: Expressing dissatisfaction or disagreement by listing alternatives.
  nuance: Often used when the speaker is annoyed or finds the listed statements pointless, contradictory,
    or indicative of indecisiveness.
  colocation: Often used with words or phrases that indicate annoyance, exasperation, or repetitive action,
    such as 「文句 ばかり (言っている)」 (always complaining), 「決め られない」 (cannot decide), 「うるさい」 (annoying), 「困る」
    (troublesome), 「自慢 し たり 卑下 し たり する」 (bragging or belittling oneself).
  grammatical-role: This phrase serves to nominalize and juxtapose two contrasting or contradictory statements,
    presenting them as the object of the speaker's frustration or complaint. It functions as a single
    unit within the sentence.
  logical-flow: The construction highlights a logical inconsistency or indecision by presenting two opposing
    ideas as if they are being stated or considered simultaneously, leading to the speaker's exasperation.
  temporal-flow: Often implies a repeated or ongoing pattern of contradictory statements or behavior over
    time, rather than a single instance. The action of 'saying' or 'doing' these contradictory things
    is perceived as continuous.
  spatial-flow: Not directly related to spatial flow, but the back-and-forth nature of the contrasting
    statements can be metaphorically understood as moving between two opposing conceptual 'spaces' without
    settling.
etymology: The pattern 「の〜のと」 originates from the particle 「の」, which serves to nominalize a preceding
  phrase or clause, combined with 「と」, a particle often used to indicate a quote or something said. The
  repetition of 「の」 with contrasting elements emphasizes the speaker's frustration with the different
  or conflicting statements being made, creating a sense of exasperation or annoyance. The structure highlights
  the back-and-forth or contradictory nature of the statements being commented upon.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「Verb[dictionary]・Adjective・Noun+の〜のと」 is used to express disagreement or dissatisfaction by listing conflicting or contradictory statements or conditions that someone is saying or presenting. It often conveys a sense of annoyance, exasperation, or frustration on the part of the speaker.

  This pattern indicates that someone is endlessly going back and forth between two opposing ideas, complaining about various aspects, or simply being indecisive. The speaker uses 「の〜のと」 to highlight this behavior and express their negative sentiment about it.

  **Key characteristics of usage:**
  *   **Listing Contrasting Ideas**: It connects two contrasting or opposing statements, actions, or qualities. These can be affirmative and negative forms of the same word (e.g., 行く の 行か ない のと), or antonyms (e.g., いい の 悪い のと).
  *   **Expression of Speaker's Annoyance**: The primary function is to convey the speaker's annoyance, frustration, or a sense that the listed points are pointless or irritating. It's not merely a neutral listing of alternatives.
  *   **Informal Context**: This pattern is generally informal and frequently used in casual conversations, often when complaining about someone else's behavior or a problematic situation.
  *   **Grammatical Forms**: The forms preceding 「の」 are typically plain forms of verbs, i-adjectives, na-adjectives (followed by な), or nouns (followed by な). The second clause can also be a plain sentence.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   While the structure can list more than two items, the typical and most impactful usage is for two contrasting points, emphasized by the repeated 「の〜のと」.
  *   This construction is distinct from simply stating alternatives or listing facts; it always carries a nuance of criticism or exasperation.

  - term: だの〜だのと
    meaning: Listing various things (often complaints or criticisms); saying ~ and ~.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While similar in conveying a negative nuance by listing items, 「だ の 〜 だ の と」 often implies
      a more exhaustive or disparaging list of various unrelated complaints, not necessarily conflicting
      opposites. It can sometimes be used to list various reasons for dissatisfaction, whereas 「の 〜 の
      と」 typically focuses on the back-and-forth or contradictory nature of two specific statements or
      states.
    grammar_point: だの (listing with negative nuance)
  - term: とか〜とか
    meaning: Listing examples; saying things like ~ or ~.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とか 〜 とか」 is a more neutral way to list examples or possibilities, often without the strong
      nuance of dissatisfaction or annoyance found in 「の 〜 の と」. It simply means "things like X and Y"
      or "X or Y, etc.," whereas 「の 〜 の と」 specifically highlights conflicting statements or indecisiveness
      in a critical light.
    grammar_point: とか〜とか (listing examples)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between 「の〜のと」, 「だの〜だのと」, and 「とか〜とか」, consider the nuance.
  「の〜のと」 emphasizes the *contradictory or indecisive* nature of two specific statements, conveying the
  speaker's frustration with the back-and-forth. 「だの〜だのと」, on the other hand, is used to list *multiple*
  complaints or criticisms, often with a disparaging tone, and the items don't necessarily have to be
  direct opposites. Lastly, 「とか〜とか」 is a neutral listing particle for examples or possibilities, carrying
  no inherent negative or exasperated nuance. Choose 「の〜のと」 when you want to highlight frustrating indecision
  or contradictory statements from someone, especially when they go back and forth between two clear options.

      status. The phrase 「嘘 を つい て いる」 (is lying) explicitly states the speaker's judgment, emphasizing
      that the conflicting statements are perceived as dishonest and annoying.

    japanese:
      - 彼女 は、忙しい {の} 暇 {な の} と、都合 が 変わり やすい。
      - 彼女、忙しい {の} 暇 {な の} と って、都合 が 二 転 三 転 する から 困る。
      - あの 子、忙しい {の} 暇 {な の} と、行っ たり 来 たり で 予定 立て にくい。
    english_literally: As for her, busy or free, convenience changes easily.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 忙しい {か} 暇 {か}
        english: She asks if she's busy or free (neutral inquiry).
        hint: 「〜か〜か」 presents a neutral choice or question. We're looking for an expression that describes
          the ongoing inconvenience caused by her fluctuating availability, not just a simple query about
          her status.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 忙しい {と か} 暇 {と か}
        english: She talks about things like being busy or free (neutrally).
        hint: 「とか 〜 とか」 lists examples neutrally. We're looking for an expression emphasizing the speaker's
          annoyance with the unpredictability of her schedule, which is stronger than a neutral enumeration.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 忙しい {だ の}、暇 {だ の と}
        english: She complains about being busy or free, among other things.

          the same topic.
    scene: A friend's schedule is incredibly erratic, making it difficult to plan anything with her.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: This example beautifully uses 「忙しい { の } 」 (i-adjective) and 「暇 { な の } 」 (na-adjective) to
      show her conflicting states. 「都合 が 変わり やすい」 (her convenience changes easily) explicitly states the
      problem, highlighting the speaker's frustration with her unpredictable schedule.
  - english: He's always going on about whether something is important or not important.
    japanese:

          - 大切 {か} 大切 で ない {か}
        english: He asks if it is important or not important (neutral inquiry).
        hint: 「〜か〜か」 presents a neutral choice or question. We're looking for an expression that conveys

          - 大切 {と か} 大切 で ない {と か}
        english: He talks about things like being important or not important (neutrally).
        hint: 「とか 〜 とか」 lists examples neutrally. We're looking for an expression that highlights the
          speaker's frustration with the man's tendency to argue about contradictory evaluations, which
          is stronger than a neutral listing.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 大切 {だ の}、大切 で ない {だ の と}
        english: He complains about things being important or not, among other things.

      repetitive and often unproductive behavior.
  - english: They're arguing about whether he's a professional or not, it's exhausting.

          - プロ {か} プロ で ない {か}
        english: They are discussing whether he is a professional or not (neutral inquiry).
        hint: 「〜か〜か」 presents a neutral choice or question. We're looking for an expression that conveys
          annoyance at a persistent, unresolved argument, not a simple factual query about someone's status.
      - competing_japanese:
          - プロ {と か} プロ で ない {と か}
        english: They talk about things like being a professional or not (neutrally).
        hint: 「とか 〜 とか」 lists examples neutrally. We're looking for an expression that highlights the
          speaker's exasperation with the group's constant and contradictory arguments, which is stronger
          than a neutral listing.

          the same topic.
    scene: A group of colleagues are endlessly debating whether a new hire is truly skilled or not.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「プロ { な の } プロ で ない { な の と } 」 uses the Noun + な の Noun + な のと formation, effectively contrasting
      the two opposing views. 「口論 し て いる」 (are arguing) explicitly states the negative outcome of this
      constant back-and-forth, emphasizing the speaker's weariness.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, the core function of 「の〜のと」 is to express the
  speaker's exasperation when faced with contradictory statements or behaviors. It's often used when someone
  keeps going back and forth on a topic, or complains about two opposite extremes. This makes it a powerful
  tool for conveying nuance in everyday conversation, especially when you want to express a sense of 'here
  we go again' or 'can't you make up your mind?'
