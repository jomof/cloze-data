jlpt: N5
etymology: 「あんな」 is part of the 'ko-so-a-do' series of Japanese demonstratives, derived from 「あのような」 (a
  no you na), meaning 'like that'. The 'あ' (a-) element universally indicates something far from both
  the speaker and the listener, while 'ような' describes similarity or type. Over time, 「あのような」 was condensed
  into the more casual and common 「あんな」.
writeup: |-
  「あんな」 is a demonstrative adjective (連体詞 - rentai-shi) used to refer to 'that kind of' or 'such a' thing, person, or situation that is physically distant from both the speaker and the listener, or conceptually distant (e.g., a past event, an abstract idea, something surprising or unbelievable). It always precedes a noun it modifies.

  Like other 'a-' series words (e.g., 「あそこ」, 「あの」), 「あんな」 points to something outside the immediate vicinity or shared experience of the conversation participants. It often carries a nuance of surprise, disdain, admiration, or strong emotion, especially when referring to something extreme or unexpected. While it literally means 'that kind of (over there)', its usage can extend to 'such a' when expressing strong feelings about something that is mentally or emotionally 'far removed' from the speaker's norm or expectation.

  - term: どんな (what kind of)
    meaning: what kind of, what sort of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どんな」 is an interrogative word used to ask about the kind or nature of something. 「あんな」 provides
      the answer, describing something far off or conceptually distant.
    grammar_point: どんな (what kind of)
  - term: あの (that)
    meaning: that (over there)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「あの」 modifies a specific noun that is distant from both parties. 「あんな」 modifies a noun to
      describe its *type* or *kind* as being 'like that distant one' or 'such a (distant example)', often
      implying an emotional reaction to that type.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:この・その・あの・どの (demonstrative determiners)
post_false_friends_writeup: The Japanese demonstratives 「こ・そ・あ・ど」 (ko-so-a-do) are fundamental for indicating
  spatial, temporal, and conceptual relationships. 「こんな」 refers to something 'this' kind (near the speaker),
  「そんな」 to 'that' kind (near the listener or just mentioned in context), 「あんな」 to 'that' kind (far from
  both or conceptually distant/extreme), and 「どんな」 is the question word 'what' kind. Understanding their
  respective 'zones' of reference—speaker's, listener's, distant, and interrogative—is key to distinguishing
  their usage.

        hint: The nuance of 'such a' emphasizes the extreme or unforgettable nature of the accident, using

        hint: The inclusion of 「あんな」 here stresses the *degree* or *type* of quietness that is being denied,
          implying a vivid memory of her being very different. It's not just 'not quiet', but 'not *that*
          kind of quiet'.

        hint: 「その」 would refer to an idea just mentioned or currently being discussed. 「あんな」 suggests
          the idea is somewhat distant, perhaps from a different context or time, or is being dismissed
          as unrealistic.
    scene: Two colleagues are brainstorming during a meeting, and one dismisses an idea that was proposed
