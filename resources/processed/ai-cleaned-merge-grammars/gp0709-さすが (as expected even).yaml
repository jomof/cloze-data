jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General use
  function: Expresses the speaker's strong feeling that something has turned out as expected, often with
    admiration.
  nuance: Can convey admiration for expected qualities, or a negative sense of 'even' when an expected
    standard isn't met.
etymology: The etymology of 「さすが」 is debated, but one theory suggests it originates from 「然様 (sayō)」,
  meaning "that way" or "as it is." Over time, it evolved to express a feeling of agreement or acceptance
  of a situation, eventually taking on the meaning of "as one would expect."
writeup: |-
  「さすが」, often written as 「流石」, is an adverb that expresses the speaker's feeling of being impressed that something has lived up to its reputation or what was expected. It conveys a sense of admiration or acknowledgment that someone or something is living up to their potential or reputation. In English, this translates to "as expected," "that's just like (A)," or "impressive."

  As 「さすが」 is an adverb, it can appear at the beginning of a sentence, often followed by 「に」, or directly before a noun with 「の」. For example, 「さすがに」 emphasizes the expected outcome in a given situation.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *   While generally positive, 「さすが」 can occasionally carry a negative nuance, similar to "even" in English. This implies that even someone or something exceptional couldn't overcome a particular challenge, expressing a sense of disappointment or resignation.
  *   The kanji form 「流石」 is an example of 「借字 (shakuji)」, where the kanji's meaning is unrelated to the word's actual meaning.

  - term: はたして
    meaning: Wonder if ~ (really)?, Wonder how ~ (actually)?, Sure enough, As expected
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「さすが」, 「はたして」 is more often used to express doubt or questioning before an event happens,
      or to confirm a result after it has occurred. 「さすが」 is more about acknowledging inherent qualities
      or expected outcomes.
    grammar_point: はたして (really; as expected)
  - term: やはり
    meaning: as expected; as I thought; after all; too; also
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「やはり」 is generally more objective, indicating that something is simply "as expected" or "after
      all," often confirming a prior thought or common knowledge. 「さすが」 carries a stronger sense of admiration
      or an implied higher standard being met, or a specific exception being noted (as in "even X").
    grammar_point: やはり (as expected・after all・still)
  - term: 当然
    meaning: naturally; as a matter of course; of course
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「当然」 is a more direct and objective statement of naturalness or obviousness, often without
      the nuance of admiration or slight surprise found in 「さすが」. It simply states that something is logical
      or expected.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:当然 (natural or obvious)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「さすが」, 「はたして」, 「やはり」, and 「当然」 can all relate to what is expected, their
  nuances differ. Use 「さすが」 to convey admiration or acknowledge someone's inherent qualities, abilities,
  or reputation, or to highlight an exceptional case. 「はたして」 is used to express doubt or questioning before
  an event, or to confirm a result afterwards. 「やはり」 offers a more objective confirmation that something
  turned out as expected or after all. In contrast, 「当然」 states that something is natural, logical, or
  obvious, often without the specific nuance of admiration or an exceptional standard.

        hint: 「やはり」 (yahari) is more objective, simply confirming something that was expected or known.

    scene: A kendo master watching his student perform exceptionally well.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The speaker, a kendo master, uses 「さすが」 to express admiration and acknowledgment of the student's
      expected excellence in kendo, given their years of practice. The neutral ending 「です」 fits the formal
      observation.
    etymology: The phrase 「〜だけあって」 reinforces the idea that the skill is a natural outcome of the dedicated
      practice.

    japanese:

    scene: Two friends watching a karaoke performance by someone with a musical background.
    register: semi-formal

    nuance: The use of 「さすがに」 here emphasizes that his singing ability is not just good, but impressively
      good, as would be expected from a former professional. The 「ですね」 softens the statement, indicating
      shared observation. A female speaker might use 「わ ね」 for a softer, more reflective tone.
    etymology: The conjunction 「だから」 explicitly states the reason for the expected outcome.

          highlights that even someone exceptional or famous faces a challenge, emphasizing their high
          standard.

          - 彼女 {で すら}、この 複雑 な パズル に は 時間 が かかる だろう。
        english: Even she, this complex puzzle will probably take time.
        hint: 「〜ですら」 (de sura) is also 'even', often used for extremes or surprising cases. 「さすがの～でも」
          puts more emphasis on the 'as expected' quality of the person/thing, setting a higher bar before
          acknowledging the difficulty.
    scene: A tutor remarking on a difficult problem for a very smart student.
    register: formal
    setting: academic

    listener_gender: no one

      enough to require time, underscoring its difficulty relative to her high capabilities. 「だろう」 indicates
      a reasonable presumption, suitable for an academic context.
    etymology: The phrase 「〜でも」 ('even for') combined with 「さすがの」 reinforces the exceptional nature of
      the subject and the unexpected difficulty they face.
  - english: As expected, if you eat this much, your stomach will hurt.
    japanese:

        english: As expected, if you eat this much, your stomach will hurt.
        hint: 「やっぱり」 (yappari) suggests confirming a prior thought or common knowledge. While similar,
          「さすがに」 (sasuga ni) often carries a more definitive or emphatic 'as expected' for a situation.
    scene: A parent warning their child about eating too much.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The direct warning tone of 「お腹が痛くなるよ」 is common for an older person, like a parent, addressing
      a younger person, such as a child. A male speaker might use 「なる ぞ」, while a female speaker might
      use 「なる わ よ」 for emphasis and a feminine touch. 「さすがに」 indicates this outcome is a natural, foreseeable
      consequence.
    etymology: The conditional 「〜たら」 sets up the consequence, and 「さすがに」 confirms it is an expected or
      obvious one.

    japanese:

        english: Late again? After all, Yamada, your way of using time is unique!
        hint: 「やっぱり」 (yappari) might be used in a more resigned or matter-of-fact way, meaning 'after
          all' or 'as expected'. 「さすが」 (sasuga) in this sarcastic context more pointedly implies that
          their 'unique' time management is a characteristic trait, often with a hint of exasperation.
    scene: A colleague making a sarcastic comment to a habitually late coworker.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「また遅刻か」 followed by a sarcastic 「さすが」 is typical of casual peer-to-peer conversation.
      The final 「ね」 softens the sarcasm slightly while still delivering the punch, implying that his lateness
      is an 'expected' (negative) trait. A male speaker might use 「だ ぜ」 for a stronger, more masculine
      tone, while a female speaker might use 「だ わ ね」 for a slightly softer, more reflective tone.
    etymology: 「時間 の 使い 方 が どくとく だ」 is a euphemism for 'bad time management', adding to the sarcastic
      tone.

        hint: 「〜でさえ」 (de sae) generally means 'even' and can be used to emphasize an unexpected difficulty

          the difficulty.

    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious

    nuance: 「さすがの」 emphasizes that the problem's complexity was such that *even* a highly capable group
      of experts found it challenging, underscoring the extreme difficulty. The phrasing is formal, suitable
      for a professional discussion. 「苦慮し た」 is a plain past form, while 「苦慮し まし た」 is polite.

      the problem's complexity.

    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「さすがに」 highlights that the exquisite seasoning is an expected and admirable outcome, given
      the chef's extensive experience. The phrase 「〜だけに」 reinforces the reason for the expectation. 「絶妙だ」

          as expected.
        hint: 「やっぱり」 (yappari) implies a more general confirmation of expectation, or 'after all'. 「さすが」
          (sasuga) specifically indicates that the excellence is consistent with the actor's reputation
          or inherent quality, often with a sense of admiration.
    scene: Film critics discussing a popular actor's consistent high-quality performances.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「さすが」 in this context conveys that the excellence of the latest work was not surprising but
      rather an expected continuation of the actor's consistently high quality. The polite 「〜だった」 or 「でした」
      is suitable for academic discourse. The use of 「が」 or 「けど」 for 'but' also reflects the formal or
      semi-formal tone.
    etymology: The conjunction 「が」 (ga) introduces a contrast or a slight concession before presenting
      the expected outcome.

          an undeniable conclusion in a given situation.
    scene: Friends discussing a canceled outdoor event due to a sudden storm.
    register: casual

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「さすがに」 here conveys a sense of resigned acceptance that the cancellation was inevitable
      and expected due to the severe weather. The 「ね」 softens the confirmation, indicating shared understanding.
      「中止だ ね」 is casual, while 「中止 です ね」 is polite. Adding 「よ ね」 can add more emphasis on shared understanding.

      this particular defeat difficult, underscoring the severity of the loss. The use of 「だろう」 or 「でしょう」
      indicates a strong, well-reasoned presumption. This tone is common in sports commentary.
    etymology: 「堪える」 (kotaeru) means 'to bear' or 'to endure', implying emotional or physical hardship.
post_example_writeup: 'When using 「さすが」, pay close attention to the context and tone. It can express genuine
  admiration, but in certain situations, it can also imply sarcasm or a resigned acknowledgment of an
  expected, often negative, outcome. The particles 「に」 and 「の」 often accompany 「さすが」 to specify the role
  it plays in the sentence: 「さすがに」 often modifies a verb or adjective to express an expected outcome,
  while 「さすがの〜でも」 highlights that even someone or something exceptional faced a challenge.'
