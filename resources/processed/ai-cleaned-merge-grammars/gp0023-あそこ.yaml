It can refer to physical locations or more abstract, emotional \"places.\" Like 「あれ」, 「あそこ」 can also refer back to a previously mentioned place, especially when both parties share a familiarity with the subject.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nDistinguish 「あそこ」 from 「あっち」. While both can translate to \"over there,\" 「あっち」 emphasizes direction, whereas 「あそこ」 simply designates a specific place.",
