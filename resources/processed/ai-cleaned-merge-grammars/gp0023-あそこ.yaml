    "etymology": "「あそこ」 is derived from the demonstrative series of words 「こそあど」, specifically 「あ」 indicating distance. It functions similarly to 「ここ」 (here) and 「そこ」 (there), but denotes a location further away from both speaker and listener.",
    "writeup": "「あそこ」 is used to indicate a place that is spatially separated from both the speaker and the listener, functioning similarly to \"that place over there\" in English. It can refer to physical locations or more abstract, emotional \"places\". Like 「あれ」, 「あそこ」 can also refer back to a previously mentioned place, especially when both parties share a familiarity with the subject.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\nDistinguish 「あそこ」 from 「あっち」. While both can translate to \"over there\", 「あっち」 emphasizes direction, whereas 「あそこ」 simply designates a specific place.",
