    "etymology": "あそこ is derived from the demonstrative series (ko-so-a-do) in Japanese. 「こ」 represents near the speaker, 「そ」 represents near the listener, 「あ」 represents distant from both.  So, あそこ literally means 'that place far away'.",
    "writeup": "Like 「ここ」 (here) and 「そこ」 (there), 「あそこ」 identifies a place. However, 「あそこ」 refers to a place that is distant from both the speaker and the listener. This translates roughly to \"that place over there\" in English.\n\n「あそこ」 can identify physical locations or emotional ones. Like 「あれ」, 「あそこ」 can refer back to a previously mentioned place, but only when both speaker and listener are very familiar with it.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nDo not confuse 「あそこ」 with 「あっち」, which also translates to \"over there.\" 「あっち」 emphasizes direction, while 「あそこ」 focuses solely on the place itself.",
