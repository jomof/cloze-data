meaning: Ends up, Finally, In the end, (Unfortunately) As a result, This is what happened, To come about,

pronunciation:
  katakana: シマツダ
  romaji: shimatsu da
formation:
  Verb in dictionary form + 始末だ: Expresses a negative result or outcome, often after a series of unfortunate
    events.
jlpt: N1
etymology: The word 「始末 (shimatsu)」 itself means 'settlement,' 'circumstances,' or 'handling.' When combined
  with 「だ」, it forms a grammar point that expresses the culmination of a series of events, typically with
  a negative connotation. The nuance is that things have reached an undesirable and often regrettable
  conclusion, as if saying, 'this is the state things have come to' or 'this is how it turned out.'
writeup: |-
  「始末だ」 uses the noun 「始末」, which refers to 'settlement,' 'circumstances,' or 'the end result.' This grammar point is used to indicate a negative sequence of events that has concluded in an equally negative or undesirable outcome. It can be translated as "to wind up as (A)," "to end up as (A)," or "to come about that (A)."

  This expression typically follows verbs in their dictionary (plain) form. The core function of 「始末だ」 is to highlight an unfavorable consequence that has arisen from a particular chain of actions or circumstances. Due to this emphasis on negative outcomes, it frequently appears in sentences alongside other words that convey finality or a cumulative process, such as 「とうとう」 ('finally' or 'at last'), 「挙げ句」 ('after all is said and done' or 'in the end, often implying frustration'), or 「結局」 ('after all' or 'in the end').

  While the inclusion of these adverbs might seem redundant, they serve to intensify the expression. 「始末だ」 conveys a strong sense of culmination, encompassing the entire progression from beginning to end, leading to the current regrettable state. It suggests that the speaker views the final situation as the unfortunate, inevitable outcome of a preceding chain of events or actions, often implying a degree of blame or regret.

  - term: 結果
    meaning: result, outcome
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「結果」 is a neutral term for 'result' and can apply to any outcome, positive or negative. 「始末だ」
      specifically highlights a negative, often undesirable, outcome that is the culmination of preceding
      events.

  - term: ことになる
    meaning: it turns out that, it has been decided that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ことになる」 describes a consequence or a situation that has come to pass, often in a neutral sense
      or due to external circumstances. 「始末だ」, however, implies a negative culmination of a chain of events,
      often carrying a sense of regret or blame on the part of the speaker.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ことになる (it has been decided・to turn out that)'
  - term: あげく
    meaning: in the end, after all is said and done
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「挙げ句」 also indicates a negative outcome following a long or frustrating process, often implying
      exasperation. While similar, 「始末だ」 places more emphasis on the final, deplorable state or condition
      as the ultimate outcome, conveying a stronger sense of 'this is what it's come to.'
    grammar_point: あげく (culmination of effort)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「結果」 simply states an outcome, and 「ことになる」 describes how things came
  to be, 「始末だ」 specifically conveys the unfortunate culmination of a situation. 「挙げ句」 shares a similar
  nuance of exasperation at a negative outcome, but 「始末だ」 focuses more on the final, lamentable state
  itself, implying a deeper sense of 'this is the regrettable state of affairs.'

      consequence of procrastination, fitting the humorous tone of self-reproach.

          a serious negative culmination due to negligence. We're looking for an expression that highlights
          the dire, regrettable outcome.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: That company neglected safety measures, and it turned out that they had to recall all
          their products.
        hint: 「ことになる」 describes an outcome that has occurred. 「始末だ」 implies that a company's negligence
          has led to a highly undesirable and costly final state. We're looking for an expression that
          emphasizes the regrettable culmination of actions.
    scene: A news reporter explains the outcome of a company's negligence.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: In a formal and informative context, 「始末だ」 here expresses the regrettable and serious culmination
      of a company's actions, conveying a sense of ultimate failure due to negligence. 「安全対策を怠った」 (neglected
      safety measures) clearly indicates the cause of the negative outcome that led to 「全製品をリコールする始末だ」
      (ended up recalling all products).
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「始末だ」 is a powerful expression for conveying exasperation,
  regret, or disappointment at an undesirable outcome that has resulted from a preceding series of events
  or actions. It emphasizes the unfortunate culmination, often implying that things have come to a particularly
  bad or lamentable state.
