jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  function: Expresses an additional quality, status, or fact about the subject, implying "not only X,
    but also Y."
  nuance: Adds an additional characteristic or aspect to something that has already been stated or is
    implicitly understood. It can imply "even" or "also" in the sense of adding to a list of attributes
    or roles.
etymology: The expression 「でもある」 is a compound formed from the conjunctive form 「で」 of the plain copula
  「だ」 (or its more formal variant 「である」), the additive particle 「も」 (meaning "also" or "even"), and the
  verb 「ある」 (to exist), which here functions as a copula. Literally, it conveys the idea of "being [something],
  and also existing as [something else]." This structure evolved to allow for the assertion of multiple,
  additional attributes or states for a single subject, emphasizing that the subject possesses this characteristic
  in addition to others already known or implied.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「でもある」 is used to state that something is *also* a particular quality, state, or thing. It is formed by attaching 「でもある」 to a noun or the stem of a な-adjective.

  This structure emphasizes the additional attribute, suggesting that the subject not only possesses other characteristics but *also* this one. It's often used when presenting multiple facets of a person, object, or situation. While 「も」 simply adds 'also' to a noun or clause, 「でもある」 specifically applies the 'also' to the copular sense, meaning 'is also' or 'can also be considered.'

  **Usage with Nouns:**
  Noun + でもある
  When used with nouns, it indicates that the subject can also be categorized as or possesses the quality of that noun.

  **Usage with な-Adjectives:**
  な-Adjective stem + でもある
  For な-adjectives, the 「な」 is dropped, and 「でもある」 is attached to the stem. It signifies that the subject also exhibits the characteristic described by the な-adjective.

  It often appears in contexts where you are elaborating on something or someone's various roles, qualities, or truths.
false_friends:
  - term: も
    meaning: also, too, even
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「も」 is a particle that simply adds the meaning of "also" or "too" to a noun or a phrase. It
      does not carry the copular meaning "to be" itself. In contrast, 「でもある」 explicitly functions as a
      copula, stating that something *is* also something else, thereby affirming an additional identity
      or attribute.
    grammar_point: も (addition or emphasis particle)
  - term: 〜である
    meaning: to be (formal)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜である」 is a formal copula meaning "to be." 「でもある」 builds upon this by adding the particle
      「も」, introducing the nuance of "also" or "even." So, while 「〜である」 states "it is X," 「でもある」 states
      "it *is also* X."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:である (formal present)
  - term: 〜だけでなく
    meaning: not only... but also
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜だけでなく」 connects two clauses or items, emphasizing that both are true or apply. 「でもある」 typically
      focuses on adding an additional characteristic or role *to the subject itself*, within a single
      statement, rather than linking two separate facts or actions. It's about asserting an additional
      identity or attribute of the subject.
    grammar_point: 〜だけでなく・〜ばかりでなく・〜ばかりか (not only... but also)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「も」, 「〜である」, and 「〜だけでなく」 share common ground in expressing addition
  or existence, their precise roles differ. 「も」 simply adds another item or implies "also" without explicitly
  acting as a copula. 「〜である」 is the formal copula, forming the base upon which 「でもある」 builds by adding
  the nuance of "also." Lastly, 「〜だけでなく」 is used for connecting broader additive statements, often across
  clauses, whereas 「でもある」 typically describes an additional attribute or role of the subject within a
  single cohesive idea.
examples:
  - english: That person is also a teacher.
    japanese:
      - あの 人 は 先生 {で も ある}。
      - あの 方 は 先生 {で も あり ます}。
    english_literally: As for that person, (they) also are a teacher.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 人 も 先生 だ。
        english: That person is also a teacher.
        hint: While 「も」 here also means 'also', it doesn't emphasize that being a teacher is *another
          role* of the person in the same way 「でもある」 does. We're looking for a phrase that explicitly
          connects 'being' to 'also'.
    scene: Talking about someone who has multiple roles.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: Used to add an additional role or status to a person who might have other known roles (e.g.,
      student, parent). The structure 「先生でもある」 indicates that being a teacher is *one of* the roles they
      hold.
  - english: This design is also very practical.
    japanese:
      - この デザイン は とても 実用 的 {で も ある}。
      - この デザイン は とても 実用 的 {で も あり ます}。
    english_literally: As for this design, (it) is also very practical.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この デザイン は とても 実用 的 で、それ に 美しい。
        english: This design is very practical, and moreover beautiful.
        hint: The example uses 「でもある」 to add an *additional* attribute to the design, focusing on its
          inherent practicality beyond other qualities. We're looking for a phrase that states 'it is
          also practical'.
    scene: Discussing the qualities of a product.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The design might be beautiful or unique, but the speaker wants to emphasize that it's *also*
      practical. The phrase 「実用的な」 loses its 「な」 before 「でもある」.
  - english: He is a father, and is also a busy businessman.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 父親 で あり、忙しい ビジネス マン {で も ある}。
      - 彼 は 父親 で あり、忙しい ビジネス マン {で も あり ます}。
    english_literally: As for him, (he) is a father, and also a busy businessman.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 父親 で、忙しい ビジネス マン だ。
        english: He is a father and a busy businessman.
        hint: This sentence simply lists two attributes without the explicit 'also' emphasis on the second
          one. We're looking for a construction that stresses the 'additional' nature of being a busy
          businessman.
    scene: Describing a friend's busy life.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「でもある」 is used here to add a second significant attribute after already stating one. 「父親であり」
      uses the te-form of the copula for connection, setting up the second attribute.
  - english: Silence can also be a form of communication.
    japanese:
      - 沈黙 は コミュニケーション の 一 つ の 形 {で も ある}。
      - 沈黙 は コミュニケーション の 一 つ の 形 {で も あり ます}。
    english_literally: As for silence, (it) is also one form of communication.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 沈黙 も コミュニケーション の 一 つ の 形 だ。
        english: Silence is also a form of communication.
        hint: This version uses 「も」 with a direct copula, which is close but doesn't quite capture the
          nuanced assertion of 'being *also* this thing' as strongly as 「でもある」 in a broader context of
          its nature. We're looking for a construction that states silence can *also* function as communication.
    scene: A philosophical discussion.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: Expresses an unexpected or less obvious truth. It suggests that while communication is typically
      thought of as verbal, silence *also* serves that purpose.
  - english: He is a doctor, but is also a talented musician.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 医者 だ が、才能 ある 音楽 家 {で も ある}。
      - 彼 は 医者 だ が、才能 ある 音楽 家 {で も あり ます}。
    english_literally: As for him, (he) is a doctor, but also a talented musician.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 医者 だ が、才能 ある 音楽 家 で も ある。
        english: He is a doctor, but he is also a talented musician.
        hint: This is almost identical, but uses the more explicit particle for 'but'. We're looking for
          a phrase that expresses an additional, possibly surprising, talent.
    scene: Introducing someone with unexpected talents.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The 「だが」 (but) implies a slight contrast or surprise that someone could be both. 「でもある」 reinforces
      that the musician aspect is an additional, perhaps surprising, identity.
  - english: This cafe is a quiet place to study, and is also a good place to relax.
    japanese:
      - この カフェ は 静か な 勉強 場所 で あり、いい 休憩 場所 {で も ある}。
      - この カフェ は 静か な 勉強 場所 で、いい 休憩 場所 {で も ある}。
      - この カフェ は 静か な 勉強 場所 で あり、いい 休憩 場所 {で も あり ます}。
    english_literally: As for this cafe, (it) is a quiet study place, and also a good relaxation place.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この カフェ は 静か な 勉強 場所 だ し、いい 休憩 場所 だ。
        english: This cafe is a quiet study place, and it's a good place to relax.
        hint: This uses 「〜だし」 to list reasons, but doesn't carry the same nuance of 'being *also* this
          other thing' as 「でもある」 does for highlighting multiple facets. We're looking for a structure
          that emphasizes multiple uses of the cafe.
    scene: Recommending a cafe to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: Used to highlight multiple positive aspects of a single location, making it appealing for
      different purposes.
  - english: For some people, work is also a hobby.
    japanese:
      - ある 人々 に とっ て は、仕事 は 趣味 {で も ある}。
      - ある 人々 に とっ て は、仕事 は 趣味 {で も あり ます}。
    english_literally: As for certain people, work is also a hobby.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ある 人々 に とっ て は、仕事 も 趣味 だ。
        english: For some people, work is also a hobby.
        hint: This version is grammatically correct and similar, but 「でもある」 adds a slightly stronger nuance
          of 'it exists as this also', emphasizing a dual nature or function, rather than just a simple
          addition. We're looking for a construction that states work can *also* be a hobby.
    scene: Discussing attitudes towards work.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: States a general observation where work serves a dual purpose for some individuals.
  - english: That decision was also quite reckless.
    japanese:
      - その 決定 は かなり 無謀 {で も ある}。
      - その 決定 は かなり 無謀 {で も あり ます}。
    english_literally: As for that decision, (it) was also quite reckless.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 決定 は かなり 無謀 だっ た。
        english: That decision was quite reckless.
        hint: This simply states the decision was reckless. We're looking for a phrase that implies it
          was reckless *in addition* to other possible qualities. The original example uses the present
          tense 'is', not 'was'.
    scene: Criticizing a past decision.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: Implies the decision might have had other negative aspects, but the speaker is highlighting
      its recklessness as an additional critical point.
  - english: The tea ceremony is also a form of traditional art.
    japanese:
      - 茶道 は 伝統 的 な 芸術 の 一 つ {で も ある}。
      - 茶道 は 伝統 的 な 芸術 の 一 つ {で も あり ます}。
    english_literally: As for Sado (tea ceremony), (it) is also one form of traditional art.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 茶道 は 伝統 的 な 芸術 だ。
        english: The tea ceremony is a traditional art.
        hint: This merely states it is an art. We want to express that it *also* holds this identity among
          its various aspects. We're looking for a construction that suggests the tea ceremony is *one
          of* the traditional arts.
    scene: Explaining Japanese culture to a foreigner.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: Explains a cultural practice by adding another interpretive layer, beyond just "making tea."
  - english: His kindness is also sometimes a weakness.
    japanese:

      - 彼 の 優し さ は 時々 弱み {で も あり ます}。
    english_literally: As for his kindness, (it) is sometimes also a weakness.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 優し さ は 時々 弱み に なる。
        english: His kindness sometimes becomes a weakness.
        hint: This implies a transformation or consequence. We're looking for a direct assertion that
          kindness *is* inherently, in some instances, *also* a weakness, highlighting a dual nature.
          The original implies 'it exists as a weakness also'.
    scene: Analyzing a character's personality.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: Points out a duality where a seemingly positive trait can simultaneously have a negative aspect.
