details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used in informal speech to express a strong concession, often implying that something
    will happen or remain true regardless of the condition. It can also convey slight exasperation, a
    sense of 'no matter what,' or a casual dismissal of a hypothetical situation.
  function: To state a condition or premise, asserting that the main clause holds true despite that condition.
  nuance: A more colloquial and emphatic variant of '〜ても' or '〜でも', carrying a stronger sense of 'even
    if' or 'no matter what'. It often appears in spoken Japanese and can imply a casual, sometimes slightly
    defiant, tone.
  counterpoint: Contrast with '〜ても' (which is generally more neutral and formal) and '〜たところで' (which specifically
    implies futility).
  grammatical-role: Conjunctive expression linking a conditional clause to a main clause.
etymology: The expression '〜(っ)たって' is a colloquial contraction primarily derived from '〜ても' and '〜でも'.
  The sound change involves the 't' sound (た) often causing a preceding consonant to geminate (represented
  by the small 'っ', 促音), followed by 'て' changing to 'って' for emphasis and ease of pronunciation in rapid
  speech. For example, '行っても' becomes '行ったって', and '静かでも' becomes '静かだって'. This linguistic evolution reflects
  a common pattern in Japanese where formality and length are reduced in casual communication.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point '〜(っ)たって' is a highly versatile and common expression in casual Japanese speech. It functions as a colloquial equivalent of '〜ても' or '〜でも', conveying the meaning of 'even if', 'even though', or 'no matter what/who/how/when'. While its meaning is similar to its more formal counterparts, '〜(っ)たって' carries a distinct nuance of informality and often a stronger sense of concession or unyielding resolve. It suggests that despite the stated condition, the outcome will remain unchanged or inevitable.

  This expression can attach to different word types:
  *   For verbs, it follows the plain past (た-form). For example, 「食べたって」 (even if I eat) or 「行ったって」 (even if I go/went). Note that the small 'っ' (促音) appears naturally in verbs whose past tense involves gemination, like '行く' (to go) becoming '行った'.
  *   For い-adjectives, it takes the form of '〜くたって' (e.g., 「高くたって」 - even if it's expensive) or sometimes the plain past form '〜かったって' (e.g., 「高かったって」 - even if it was expensive).
  *   For な-adjectives and nouns, it takes the form of '〜だって' (e.g., 「静かだって」 - even if it's quiet; 「学生だって」 - even if it's a student). This 'だって' is a contraction of 'でも'.

  '〜(っ)たって' is frequently used to express a casual dismissal of an idea, a statement of fact that holds true regardless of opposing conditions, or a slightly exasperated tone when confronting a stubborn reality. Because of its casual nature, it is primarily used among friends, family, or in informal settings. It would sound out of place in formal conversations or business environments. Pay close attention to the context and your relationship with the listener when deciding whether to use '〜(っ)たって' or its more formal alternatives.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜ても (even if・even though)
    meaning: Even if, even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ても」is a more neutral and generally applicable form of concession, usable in both formal
      and informal contexts. 「〜(っ)たって」is its highly colloquial and emphatic counterpart, strictly for
      informal settings. We're looking for an informal, slightly more forceful 'even if'.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: 〜たところで (even if futile)
    meaning: Even if (futile); no matter how (useless the effort)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express a condition, 「〜たところで」specifically implies that the action or condition
      in the first clause will not lead to a desired outcome, often implying futility or uselessness.
      「〜(っ)たって」simply states a strong concession without necessarily implying futility. We're looking
      for a simple 'even if' without the nuance of futility.
    grammar_point: たところで (even if futile)
  - term: だが (but・however)
    meaning: But, however, nevertheless (informal)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だが」is a simple conjunction used to introduce a contrasting statement. 「〜(っ)たって」is a conjunctive
      expression that specifically means 'even if' or 'even though', indicating that something will happen
      or remain true regardless of the preceding condition. We're looking for a conditional concession,
      not just a simple contrast.
    grammar_point: だが (but・however)
  - term: なのに (despite・unexpected)
    meaning: Despite; even though (unexpected outcome)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なのに」expresses a contrast where the outcome is unexpected or contrary to what one would logically
      infer. It often carries a sense of dissatisfaction or surprise. 「〜(っ)たって」focuses on the concession
      ('even if') rather than the unexpectedness of the result, though it can sometimes imply surprise.
      We're looking for a direct conditional concession.
    grammar_point: のに (unexpected result)
  - term: だろう (conjecture)
    meaning: Probably; isn't it?
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「だろう」is a particle for conjecture or seeking agreement. 「〜(っ)たって」is a conjunctive expression
      meaning 'even if'. Although 'だろう' can sometimes be contracted to 'だろって' in very casual speech, it
      does not carry the concessive meaning of '〜(っ)たって'. We're looking for 'even if', not 'probably'.
    grammar_point: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「〜(っ)たって」, 「〜ても」, and 「〜たところで」 all involve concession, their nuances
  differ. 「〜ても」 is the standard and most versatile form. 「〜(っ)たって」is its colloquial, more emphatic cousin,
  best reserved for casual interactions. 「〜たところで」is distinct in that it adds a strong sense of futility
  or lack of significant impact, meaning 'even if you do X, it won't matter'. Pay attention to the level
  of formality and the intended implication about the result when choosing between these expressions.
