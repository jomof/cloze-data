  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    register: casual
    usage-context: Used in conversation to express a hypothetical or futile situation.
    function: Implies that the speaker believes the action is unlikely to succeed or is pointless.
    nuance: Often used to express a sense of futility or to downplay the significance of a statement. It
      is a contracted form of 「と言ったって」 or 「としても」. It often expresses frustration that something won't work,
      even if it seems like it should.
  etymology: （っ）たって derives from the combination of 「と」 (a particle indicating content or condition), 「言った」
    (the past tense of 「言う」, meaning "to say"), and 「って」 (a colloquial particle emphasizing the preceding
    word or phrase). The construction implies something is said or assumed to be true, but the speaker doubts
    its significance or practicality.
  writeup: （っ）たって is a conversational grammar point used to express that even if a certain condition is
    true, it doesn't change the outcome or the speaker's opinion. It's often used to express a sense of
    futility or to downplay the significance of a statement. It is a contracted form of 「と言ったって」 or 「としても」.
    You will often hear it used to express frustration that something won't work, even if it seems like
    it should. This grammar is informal and typically used in casual conversations.
  false_friends:
    - term: と言っても
      meaning: although I say. even if I say
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While both (っ)たって and と言っても express a sense of qualification, (っ)たって often implies a sense
        of futility or resignation that と言っても does not always carry. (っ)たって is a colloquial contraction
        of と言っても.
      grammar_point: と言っても (having said that)
    - term: としても
      meaning: even if. granting that
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: としても is more formal and less emphatic than (っ)たって, which is a contraction. The key difference
        is the implied futility in (っ)たって, suggesting the condition doesn't change the ultimate outcome.
      grammar_point: としても (even if assumed)
    - term: ～ても
      meaning: even if. even though
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「～ても」 expresses a general concession or condition. While it can overlap in meaning with 「(っ)たって」,
        「(っ)たって」 carries a stronger nuance of futility, resignation, or a sense that something is pointless
        despite the condition, which 「～ても」 does not inherently imply.
      grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
    - term: たところで
      meaning: even if. even though. no matter how much
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While both (っ)たって and たところで express futility, たところで directly emphasizes the negative or useless
        outcome of an action, implying that doing it is pointless. (っ)たって, on the other hand, often dismisses
        a stated condition or argument as irrelevant to the outcome, implying 'even if you say X, Y'.
      grammar_point: たところで (even if futile)
  post_false_friends_writeup: While both と言っても and としても share a similar meaning with (っ)たって, (っ)たって carries
    a stronger connotation of futility or resignation. と言っても is a more general way of making a qualification
    or concession, while としても simply acknowledges a possibility without necessarily expressing a sense of
    futility. 「～ても」 also expresses a general concession, but lacks the strong emphasis on futility found
    in (っ)たって. Additionally, たところで focuses on the direct uselessness of an action, implying it will lead
    to no positive result, whereas (っ)たって dismisses the premise or argument itself as irrelevant to the
    actual outcome.
  examples:
    - english: Even if you try to do your best from tomorrow, it's meaningless if you don't start today.
      japanese:
        - 明日 から 頑張ろう {ったって}、今日 から 始め ない と 意味 ない よ。
        - 明日 から 頑張ろう {ったって}、今日 から 始め なきゃ 意味 が ない ん だ。
        - 明日 から 頑張ろう {ったって}、今 やら なきゃ 意味 無い ぜ。
      english_literally: Even if you say you'll do your best from tomorrow, if you don't start from today,
        it's meaningless, you know.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 明日 から 頑張ろう {と し て も}、今日 から 始め ない と 意味 ない よ。
          english: Even if you try to do your best from tomorrow, it's meaningless if you don't start today.
          hint: 「としても」 is more formal and general, without the strong futility or resignation implied by
            「(っ)たって」. We're looking for a casual, more emphatic expression of futility.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 明日 から 頑張っ {て も}、今日 から 始め ない と 意味 ない よ。
          english: Even if you do your best from tomorrow, it's meaningless if you don't start today.
          hint: 「～ても」 indicates a general concession. While similar, it lacks the specific nuance of futility
            or resignation that 「(っ)たって」 conveys, especially when referring to something you *try* to do.
      scene: A friend is procrastinating on a task, always saying they'll start tomorrow, but never actually
        begins.
      register: casual
      setting: instructional
      nuance: The casual 「～よ」 at the end emphasizes the speaker's direct advice, implying that while the
        listener's intent 「頑張ろう」 is noted, it is ultimately futile without present action. This is a common
        phrase to gently push someone towards action.
      etymology: The phrase 「頑張ろう」 is the volitional form of 「頑張る」 (to do one's best/persevere). The construction
        expresses a future intent or proposal, which then gets negated by the futility implied by 「(っ)たって」.
    - english: Even if he objects, this plan cannot be changed.
      japanese:
        - 彼 が 反対 する {ったって}、この 計画 は 変更 でき ない ん だ。
        - 彼 が 反対 する {ったって}、この 計画 は 変わら ない よ。
        - 彼 が 反対 する {ったって}、どうせ 決定 事項 です から。

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 が 反対 し {て も}、この 計画 は 変更 でき ない ん だ。
          english: Even if he objects, this plan cannot be changed.
          hint: 「～ても」 indicates a general 'even if'. 「(っ)たって」 adds a stronger sense of dismissal or futility,
            emphasizing that his objection is not going to change anything. We're looking for that stronger
            dismissal.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 が 反対 する {と 言っ て も}、この 計画 は 変更 でき ない ん だ。
          english: Even if he objects, this plan cannot be changed.
          hint: 「と言っても」 is a more direct way of saying 'even if one says' but doesn't carry the same casual,
            somewhat exasperated futility as 「(っ)たって」. We want the casual, dismissive tone.
      scene: Colleagues are discussing a project, and one expresses concern about a difficult team member
        who is known to oppose new ideas.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: professional
      nuance: The use of 「～ん だ」 indicates the speaker's explanation or emphasis on an underlying truth,
        reinforcing the finality of the decision. This phrasing is common in professional settings when
        a decision has been made and is non-negotiable.
      etymology: The auxiliary 「ん だ」 is a colloquial contraction of 「の だ」, which adds explanatory or emphatic
        nuance, often indicating a shared understanding or a reason for a statement.
    - english: Even if I was late, it's a problem if you don't listen to my reason.
      japanese:
        - 遅刻 し た {ったって}、理由 を 聞い て もらえ ない と 困る よ。
        - 遅刻 し た {ったって}、言い訳 くらい 聞い て くれ ない と。
        - 遅刻 し た {ったって}、一方 的 に 責める の は 違う と 思う な。
      english_literally: Even if I was late, it's troublesome if you don't listen to my reason, you know.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 遅刻 し {て も}、理由 を 聞い て もらえ ない と 困る よ。
          english: Even if I was late, it's a problem if you don't listen to my reason.
          hint: While 「～ても」 works generally for 'even if', 「(っ)たって」 here implies a mild frustration or a
            sense that 'being late' is being dismissed without considering the reason, giving it a stronger
            emotional undertone. We're looking for that frustrated nuance.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 遅刻 し た {に し て も}、理由 を 聞い て もらえ ない と 困る よ。
          english: Even if I was late, it's a problem if you don't listen to my reason.
          hint: 「にしても」 acknowledges a fact but is more formal and less conversational than 「(っ)たって」. It
            doesn't carry the same personal, slightly exasperated nuance. We need the casual, personal tone.
      scene: A student trying to explain to a strict teacher why they were late for class, feeling frustrated
        that they are being shut down.
      register: casual
      setting: apologetic
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: male
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The phrase 「～と 困る」 expresses a dilemma or trouble caused by the listener's action (or inaction).
        The casual 「～よ」 suggests a personal appeal or complaint, common among younger speakers expressing
        frustration.
      etymology: 「～てもらう」 is a passive voice construction meaning 'to receive the favor of someone doing
        something'. In this case, 「聞いてもらえない」 means 'cannot receive the favor of being listened to', indicating
        frustration at the lack of consideration.
    - english: Even if this job is difficult, we can't just give up, can we?
      japanese:
        - この 仕事 は 難しい {ったって}、諦める わけ に は いか ない だろう。
        - この 仕事 が 難しい {ったって}、放り出す わけ に は いか ない よ ね。
        - た と え 難しく {ったって}、投げ出す わけ に は いか ない さ。
      english_literally: Even if this job is difficult, it's not the reason to give up, is it?
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - この 仕事 は 難しく {て も}、諦める わけ に は いか ない だろう。
          english: Even if this job is difficult, we can't just give up, can we?
          hint: 「～ても」 expresses a simple concession. 「(っ)たって」 adds a nuance of acknowledging the difficulty
            but immediately dismissing it as a reason to stop, implying a stronger resolve despite the challenge.
            We're looking for that resolute nuance.
        - competing_japanese:
            - '{た と え} この 仕事 が 難しく {て も}、諦める わけ に は いか ない だろう。'
          english: Even if this job were difficult, we can't just give up, can we?
          hint: 「たとえ～ても」 emphasizes a hypothetical or extreme condition, but it doesn't carry the colloquial,
            slightly exasperated acknowledgement of a fact followed by a strong dismissal like 「(っ)たって」.
            We need the conversational tone.
      scene: A team facing a challenging project with many obstacles, and the team leader motivates them
        to persevere.
      register: formal
      setting: inspirational
      nuance: The phrase 「～わけ には いかない」 indicates that something is impossible or unacceptable, often due
        to social obligation or internal resolve. The use of 「～だろう」 softens the directness slightly, inviting
        agreement rather than issuing a blunt command, suitable for a leader.
      etymology: 「わけ には いかない」 literally translates to 'it is not a reason to go'. It implies that there
        is no valid reason or justification to do something, often due to moral, social, or logical constraints.
    - english: Even if it was fun back then, the situation is different now, you know.
      japanese:
        - あの 時 は 楽しかっ た {ったって}、今 と は 違う 状況 だ から ね。
        - 昔 は 楽しかっ た {ったって}、もう 今 は 無理 な ん だ よ。
        - 昔 は 楽しかっ た {ったって}、もう 同じ 経験 は でき ない さ。
      english_literally: Even if it was fun back then, because the situation is different now, you know.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - あの 時 は 楽しく {て も}、今 と は 違う 状況 だ から ね。
          english: Even if it was fun back then, the situation is different now, you know.
          hint: 「～ても」 offers a general concession. 「(っ)たって」 here highlights the speaker's resignation that
            despite how fun it was, it's futile to try to recreate it exactly because circumstances have
            changed. We want that sense of resignation.
        - competing_japanese:
            - あの 時 は 楽しかっ た {けれど}、今 と は 違う 状況 だ から ね。
          english: It was fun back then, but the situation is different now, you know.
          hint: 「～けれど」 is a simple conjunction meaning 'but' or 'although'. While it contrasts, it lacks
            the specific nuance of 'even if that were true, it's still futile/different' that 「(っ)たって」 conveys.
            We need the 'even if' meaning.
      scene: Friends reminiscing about old times, suggesting they recreate a past event, but one friend
        points out that circumstances have changed.
      register: casual
      setting: reflective
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: group
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: The ending 「～から ね」 is a common casual way to explain a reason or give a gentle reminder. The
        contrast between past enjoyment 「楽しかった」 and current reality 「違う 状況」 highlights the speaker's resignation
        that the past cannot be perfectly recreated, a common reflection for older individuals.
      etymology: The conjunction 「だから」 is a causal linker meaning 'therefore' or 'because'. In casual speech,
        it often contracts to 「だから ね」 or 「から ね」, which adds a nuance of mild explanation or seeking agreement,
        making the statement sound less assertive.
    - english: Even if he's kind, there might be a hidden agenda.
      japanese:
        - 彼 は 親切 {だ って}、裏 が ある か も しれ ない よ。
        - 彼 が 親切 {だ って}、信用 し すぎる の は 危ない よ。
        - 彼 が 親切 {だ って}、警戒 する に 越し た こと は ない さ。
      english_literally: Even if he is kind, there might be a hidden agenda, you know.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 は 親切 {で も}、裏 が ある か も しれ ない よ。
          english: Even if he's kind, there might be a hidden agenda.
          hint: 「～ても」 provides a general 'even if' for adjectives and nouns. 「(っ)たって」 here suggests a stronger,
            more suspicious 'even if that's true, I still doubt it', conveying a dismissive tone towards
            the apparent kindness. We're looking for that dismissive, cautious tone.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 は 親切 {と 言っ て も}、裏 が ある か も しれ ない よ。
          english: Even if he's kind (as people say), there might be a hidden agenda.
          hint: 「と言っても」 implies 'even if it is said that'. While similar, 「(っ)たって」 is more direct and less
            formal, and carries a nuance of personal doubt or suspicion more strongly than merely stating
            a common opinion. We need the more personal, casual doubt.
      scene: Two people discussing a new acquaintance who seems almost too good to be true, leading to suspicion.
      register: casual
      setting: cautious
      nuance: The phrase 「裏 が ある」 (lit. "there's a back") means there's a hidden motive or agenda, conveying
        suspicion. The casual 「～よ」 and 「～かも しれない」 express a speculative warning, fitting for a casual conversation
        about a potentially untrust trustworthy person.
      etymology: The expression 「裏 が ある」 is an idiom meaning 'there is a hidden motive/agenda/trick'. 「裏」
        literally means 'back' or 'reverse side', and the idiom implies that there's something hidden behind
        the surface appearance.
    - english: Even if someone is a doctor, they're human, so they're not perfect.
      japanese:
        - 医者 {だ って}、人間 だ から 完璧 じゃ ない よ。
        - 医者 {だ って}、ミス も する ん だ よ。
        - 医者 {だ って}、間違う こと も ある ん だ から。
      english_literally: Even if someone is a doctor, because they are human, they are not perfect, you
        know.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 医者 {で も}、人間 だ から 完璧 じゃ ない よ。
          english: Even if someone is a doctor, they're human, so they're not perfect.
          hint: 「～ても」 provides a general concession. 「(っ)たって」 here emphasizes the futility of expecting
            perfection, highlighting that being a doctor doesn't exempt one from human fallibility. We want
            that emphasis on the futility of expectation.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 医者 {と は いえ}、人間 だ から 完璧 じゃ ない よ。
          english: Though one may be a doctor, they're human, so they're not perfect.
          hint: 「とはいえ」 means 'though that said' or 'it is true that... but'. It offers a concession but
            is more formal and less direct than 「(っ)たって」, which carries a more casual, dismissive tone toward
            the idea of perfection. We need the conversational, dismissive nuance.
      scene: Someone is overly critical of a doctor's mistake, and another person reminds them that doctors
        are also fallible humans.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: male
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: The casual 「～よ」 adds a friendly, advising tone. The common phrase 「人間 だ から」 (because they're
        human) reinforces the universal truth. This example demonstrates how 「(っ)たって」 can be used to temper
        overly high expectations by pointing out a fundamental, unchangeable reality.
      etymology: The phrase 「完璧 じゃ ない」 means 'not perfect'. 「完璧」 is a noun meaning 'perfection', and 「じゃ
        ない」 is the casual negative form of the copula 「です/だ」. This construction is a common way to express
        imperfection or lack of something.
    - english: Even if you try to convince him, he probably won't listen.
      japanese:
        - 彼 を 説得 しよう {ったって}、多分 聞き入れ ない だろう な。
        - 彼 を 説得 しよう {と し たって}、無駄 だ と 思う よ。
        - あいつ を 説得 しよう {ったって}、聞く 耳 持た ない だろう な。
      english_literally: Even if you try to persuade him, he probably won't listen, you know.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 を 説得 しよう {と し て も}、多分 聞き入れ ない だろう な。
          english: Even if you try to convince him, he probably won't listen.
          hint: 「～としても」 is generally used for 'even if' but lacks the strong sense of futility or a dismissed
            effort that 「(っ)たって」 conveys. We're looking for that resignation about a futile attempt.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 を 説得 し {て も}、多分 聞き入れ ない だろう な。
          english: Even if you convince him, he probably won't listen.
          hint: 「～ても」 expresses a simple concession. 「(っ)たって」 specifically implies that the *effort* of
            trying is useless, not just the outcome. We need to emphasize the futility of the attempt itself.
      scene: Two friends discussing a stubborn third friend who refuses to change his mind.
      register: casual
      setting: pessimistic
      conjugation: volitional (～よう)
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The use of 「だろう な」 at the end, coupled with 「説得しよう ったって」, emphasizes the speaker's resignation
        and low expectation of success. The phrase 「聞き入れない」 implies a strong refusal to accept advice or
        persuasion, common when dealing with someone stubborn.
      etymology: 「聞き入れる」 means to listen and accept, often implying to accede to someone's request or advice.
        It combines 「聞く」 (to hear/listen) and 「入れる」 (to put in/accept).
    - english: Even if it was a big mistake, we have to learn from it and move forward.
      japanese:
        - 大きな 失敗 {だっ た って}、そこ から 学ん で 進む しか ない。
        - どんな に 大きな 失敗 {だっ た って}、教訓 に する べき だ。
        - あれ が 大きな 失敗 {だっ た って}、前向き に 捉える しか ない だろ。
      english_literally: Even if it was a big mistake, there is no choice but to learn from there and move
        forward.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 大きな 失敗 {で も}、そこ から 学ん で 進む しか ない。
          english: Even if it was a big mistake, we have to learn from it and move forward.
          hint: 「～でも」 is a general 'even if' for nouns. 「(っ)たって」 here carries a stronger nuance of acknowledging
            the negative event but immediately dismissing its power to stop progress, emphasizing resilience.
            We want that resilient nuance.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 大きな 失敗 {だ と は いえ}、そこ から 学ん で 進む しか ない。
          english: Though it was a big mistake, we have to learn from it and move forward.
          hint: 「とはいえ」 means 'though that said' or 'it is true that... but'. It's more formal and less direct
            than 「(っ)たって」, which directly acknowledges the condition and then emphatically brushes it aside
            as insufficient reason to stop. We need the direct, emphatic tone.
      scene: A mentor advising a mentee who is discouraged by a significant setback.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: inspirational
      nuance: The phrase 「～しか ない」 expresses that there is no other option, highlighting the necessity of
        moving forward. The speaker uses 「だったって」 to acknowledge the past negative event while immediately
        pivoting to a constructive attitude, showing resilience.
      etymology: 「前向きに捉える」 means to perceive something positively or to take a forward-looking view. 「前向き」

          english: Even if it's cheap, is it really good quality?
          hint: 「～ても」 is a general 'even if' for i-adjectives. 「(っ)たって」 here adds a tone of skepticism or
            doubt, implying that being cheap doesn't necessarily mean it's worth buying. We're looking for
            that skeptical tone.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 安い {と は いえ}、本当 に 品質 は 大丈夫 な の？
          english: Though it's cheap, is the quality really alright?
          hint: 「とはいえ」 acknowledges a fact but is more formal and less conversational than 「(っ)たって」, which
            conveys a more direct and often frustrated or doubtful tone about the underlying assumption.
            We need the casual, doubtful nuance.
      scene: Two friends shopping for electronics, and one expresses skepticism about a very cheap item.
      register: casual
      setting: interrogative
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The interrogative 「なの？」 emphasizes a strong doubt or suspicion despite the stated condition
        of being cheap. This is a common way to express skepticism about something that seems too good to
        be true.
      etymology: 「品質」 (hinshitsu) means quality. It is a compound word formed from 「品」 (hin), meaning 'goods'
        or 'articles', and 「質」 (shitsu), meaning 'quality' or 'substance'.
    - english: Even if it's just a game, if you don't play seriously, it's not fun.

        - ゲーム {だ って}、本気 で やら なきゃ 楽しく ない さ。
        - ゲーム {だ って}、ちゃんと し ない と 面白く ない ん だ。

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:

          english: Even if it's a game, if you don't play seriously, it's not fun.
          hint: 「～でも」 can mean 'even for'. 「(っ)たって」 emphasizes a dismissal of the 'it's just a game' excuse,
            implying that despite its nature, seriousness is still required for enjoyment. We want the nuance
            of dismissing the premise.
      scene: A parent telling their child to take their game more seriously.
      register: casual
      setting: instructional
      nuance: The direct address and the use of 「～ない と 面白く ない」 (if not, it's not fun) emphasize the conditional
        necessity of seriousness. The informal 「よ」 makes it a gentle but firm piece of advice.
      etymology: The phrase 「真剣 に やる」 means to do something seriously. 「真剣」 (shinken) refers to seriousness
        or earnestness.
    - english: Even if you don't go, the result won't change.
      japanese:
        - 行か ない {ったって}、結果 は 変わら ない よ。

        - 行か ない {ったって}、もう 遅い ん だ から。

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 行か {なく て も}、結果 は 変わら ない よ。
          english: Even if you don't go, the result won't change.
          hint: 「～なくても」 means 'even if not'. 「(っ)たって」 implies a dismissal of not going as an alternative
            that would change the outcome, emphasizing the futility of inaction. We want the sense of futility
            despite an alternative choice.
      scene: A friend trying to persuade another who is reluctant to attend an event, emphasizing that their
        absence won't alter the situation.
      register: casual
      setting: persuasive
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: female
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The use of 「～ない よ」 provides a direct but soft assertion. 「結果 は 変わら ない」 (the result won't change)
        combined with 「(っ)たって」 powerfully conveys that the action (or inaction) being discussed is irrelevant
        to the predetermined outcome, expressing a sense of resignation.
      etymology: The combination of 「変わる」 (kawaru, to change) with a negative form (e.g., 「変わらない」) is a
        common way to express immutability. 「結果」 (kekka) means 'result' or 'consequence'.
  post_example_writeup: Understanding the nuances of 「(っ)たって」 requires careful attention to context, particularly
    the speaker's underlying sentiment. It's often used when expressing a sense of resignation, frustration,
    or a strong dismissal of a given condition or statement. While it shares some semantic territory with
    other concessive forms, its colloquial nature and strong implication of futility set it apart.

  jlpt: N2
  details:
    part-of-speech: conjunction
    register: casual
    function: Expresses a hypothetical situation and its predictable outcome, similar to 「ても」 but more casual.
    grammatical-role: Conjunctive particle
    logical-flow: Concessive (result occurs regardless of condition)
    temporal-flow: hypothetical
  etymology: 「(っ)たって」 is an informal contraction of 「〜ても」, which combines the past tense auxiliary verb
    「た」 with the conjunctive particle 「って」, a colloquial form of 「ても」. The additional 「っ」 can add emphasis
    or be omitted depending on the speaker's preference.
  writeup: |-
    The grammar point 「(っ)たって」 is a colloquial equivalent of 「ても」, expressing "even if," "even though," or "no matter how." It's primarily used in casual conversation to emphasize that a particular result will occur irrespective of the condition being stated. This structure is commonly used to dismiss a condition as irrelevant to the final outcome, indicating a sense of resignation or inevitability. It is not typically used in formal writing or speech.

    「(っ)たって」 can be attached to various word types: verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. Its usage extends to both affirmative and negative hypothetical conditions, making it a versatile informal expression. The optional small 「っ」, which indicates a glottal stop or doubled consonant sound, can add emphasis, but its omission does not change the meaning.
  false_friends:
    - term: ても
      meaning: even if; even though
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「(っ)たって」 is an informal version of 「ても」, primarily used in casual speech. 「ても」 is a more versatile,
        standard form that can be used in both formal and informal contexts.
      grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
    - term: たところで
      meaning: even if (it happens), it's useless/futile
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While both imply a condition, 「たところで」 specifically emphasizes the futility or ineffectiveness
        of the action or state, suggesting that the result will not change. 「(っ)たって」 is a more neutral concessive,
        simply stating the outcome regardless of the condition.
      grammar_point: たところで (even if futile)
    - term: たとえ〜ても
      meaning: even if
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「たとえ〜ても」 explicitly sets up a strong hypothetical situation, often with a sense of "even if
        it were to happen." It's more formal and emphasizes the hypothetical nature more strongly than the
        casual 「(っ)たって」, which directly states the concession.
      grammar_point: たとえ〜ても (even if)
    - term: ようと・が
      meaning: no matter・even if
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「ようと・が」 is a more emphatic and often stronger way to say "no matter how/what/who" compared
        to 「(っ)たって」. It tends to be more formal or literary, highlighting that something holds true irrespective
        of the preceding condition, with a sense of inevitability or disregard for the condition.
      grammar_point: ようと・が (no matter・even if)
    - term: にもかかわらず
      meaning: despite
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「にもかかわらず」 conveys "despite" or "in spite of," often indicating that something happened contrary
        to expectation given the preceding condition. While 「(っ)たって」 also expresses a kind of "even if,"
        「にもかかわらず」 places more emphasis on the unexpected or contradictory nature of the outcome. It is also
        a more formal expression.
      grammar_point: にもかかわらず (despite)
    - term: とはいえ
      meaning: though
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While both 「(っ)たって」 and 「とはいえ」 express concession, 「とはいえ」 often acknowledges a preceding statement
        as true before introducing a qualification or contrasting idea, meaning "though that may be true."
        「(っ)たって」 more directly states a hypothetical condition and its inevitable outcome. 「とはいえ」 is also
        more formal.
      grammar_point: とはいえ (though)
    - term: ども
      meaning: even though
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「ども」 is a very formal and literary conjunction equivalent to 「けれども」 or 「ても」. It expresses
        concession or contrast, "even though" or "although." Unlike the casual 「(っ)たって」, 「ども」 is rarely
        used in spoken Japanese and signals a highly formal or written context.
      grammar_point: ども (even though)
    - term: としても
      meaning: even if assumed
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Both 「(っ)たって」 and 「としても」 express "even if." However, 「としても」 often implies a hypothetical assumption,
        "even if we assume X is true," or dismisses the relevance of a potential fact. 「(っ)たって」 is a more
        casual and direct way to state that the outcome is unaffected by the condition, without necessarily
        implying an 'assumption'.
      grammar_point: としても (even if assumed)
  post_false_friends_writeup: While 「(っ)たって」 and its counterparts like 「ても」, 「たとえ〜ても」, 「としても」, 「とはいえ」, 「ども」,
    「ようと・が」, and 「にもかかわらず」 all convey 'even if' or 'despite,' their primary distinctions lie in formality,
    nuance, and specific emphasis. 「(っ)たって」 is exclusively for casual contexts, whereas 「ても」 is more versatile
    across registers. 「たとえ〜ても」 and 「としても」 emphasize a stronger hypothetical or assumed condition. More formal
    options like 「とはいえ」 and 「ども」 are often used in written or highly polite contexts, with 「とはいえ」 acknowledging
    a truth before qualification, and 「ども」 simply meaning 'even though'. 「たところで」 carries a distinct nuance
    of futility, implying that an action will make no difference to the outcome, which is not inherent in
    「(っ)たって」. Lastly, expressions like 「ようと・が」 and 「にもかかわらず」 denote a stronger, more definite disregard
    for the preceding condition or highlight an unexpected outcome, respectively. Understanding these subtle
    differences in tone and implication is key to choosing the most appropriate expression.

          english: Even if you hadn't invited me, I was planning to go (and your invitation would have been
            pointless).
          hint: 「たところで」 suggests the action is pointless or doesn't change the outcome, while 「(っ)たって」 states
            the condition without implying futility. We're looking for a simple statement of intent regardless
            of the condition.
      scene: A friend playfully tells another friend that they were already planning to attend an event,

      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The 「よ」 at the end adds a casual, slightly assertive or confirming tone. This is common in
        friendly conversation, especially among females. The 「の」 in the second Japanese option is also common
        in female speech, softening the assertion slightly. The 「しね」 in the third option adds a nuanced
        sense of 'and besides' or 'you know', implying a casual reason.

          english: No matter how tough it was, I won't give up until the end (it having been tough was futile).
          hint: 「たところで」 implies the futility of the tough situation, while 「(っ)たって」 states commitment despite
            the difficulty. We're looking for strong determination regardless of the current state.

        the challenge.
      register: casual
      setting: inspirational
      speaker_gender: male
      nuance: The use of 「ぞ」 in the second Japanese option is a strong, assertive sentence-ending particle

        emphasizing unwavering resolve.

        conviction in a semi-formal, motivational context. In the third option, 「何が何でも」 strongly emphasizes

    - english: Even if it's just a game, I'll take it seriously!
      japanese:
        - た か が ゲーム {だ って}、私 は 本気 だ から ね！
        - 遊び {だ って}、手 を 抜か ない よ。
        - ただ の ゲーム {だ って}、真剣 に やる べき だ。
      english_literally: Even if it's just a game, I am serious because.

            - た か が ゲーム {で も}、私 は 本気 だ から ね！
          english: Even if it's just a game, I'll take it seriously!
          hint: 「でも」 is a more general way to say "even if" with nouns. We're looking for a more emphatic,
            casual expression often used in playful contexts.
        - competing_japanese:
            - た か が ゲーム {だっ た ところ で}、私 は 本気 だ から ね！
          english: Even if it was just a game, I'll take it seriously (it being a game was futile).
          hint: 「たところで」 implies that the game would be pointless anyway, which contradicts the speaker's
            serious intent. We're expressing seriousness despite the game's trivial nature.
      scene: A group of friends playing a board game or video game, and one person declares their competitive
        spirit.
      register: casual
      setting: humorous
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: The use of 「からね」 at the end of the sentence adds a feminine, emphatic, and slightly playful
        tone, common when a female speaker expresses a strong personal feeling or decision in casual settings.
        It conveys a "you know!" or "just so you know!" sentiment.
    - english: Even if you don't understand everything, it's fine if you just grasp the main points.
      japanese:
        - 全部 理解 {し なく たって}、要点 を 掴め ば 大丈夫 だ よ。
        - 細かい 所 が 分 から {なく たって}、概要 さえ 掴めれ ば いい。
        - 全て を 把握 {し なく たって}、問題 ない です よ。
      english_literally: Even if you don't understand everything, if you grasp the main points, it's alright.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 全部 理解 {し なく て も}、要点 を 掴め ば 大丈夫 だ よ。
          english: Even if you don't understand everything, it's fine if you just grasp the main points.
          hint: 「なくても」 is the more standard polite or neutral way to say "even if not". We're looking for
            a more direct and casual way to express this concession.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 全部 理解 {し なかっ た ところ で}、要点 を 掴め ば 大丈夫 だ よ。
          english: Even if you didn't understand everything, it's fine if you just grasp the main points
            (not understanding everything was futile).
          hint: 「たところで」 would imply that not understanding everything would be futile, which is not the
            intended meaning. We're simply stating that full understanding is not a prerequisite.
      scene: A teacher or mentor explaining a complex concept to a student, reassuring them that perfection
        isn't required.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
    - english: Even if I tried, I probably couldn't change anything now.
      japanese:
        - 今更 {やっ たって}、何 も 変え られ ない だろう な。
        - もう {頑張っ たって}、どう に も なら ない か も しれ ない。
        - 仮 に {動い たって}、結果 は 変わら ない よ。
      english_literally: Now, even if I did, probably nothing can be changed.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 今更 {やっ て も}、何 も 変え られ ない だろう な。
          english: Even if I tried, I probably couldn't change anything now.
          hint: 「ても」 is a standard way to say "even if". We're looking for a more colloquial and somewhat
            resigned tone.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 今更 {やっ た ところ で}、何 も 変え られ ない だろう な。
          english: Even if I tried, I probably couldn't change anything now (trying now would be futile).
          hint: While 「たところで」 expresses futility, 「(っ)たって」 here focuses more on the simple conditional 'even
            if I tried' leading to an unchanged outcome, rather than emphasizing the act itself as futile.
            The meaning is very close, but 「(っ)たって」 is more general and casual.
      scene: Someone reflecting on a past decision or situation, realizing it's too late to alter the outcome.
      register: casual
      setting: reflective
      nuance: The particle 「な」 at the end of 「だろうな」 adds a sense of resignation or self-reflection, often
        used by male speakers or in neutral, introspective contexts. It indicates a conclusion drawn by
        the speaker, often to themselves.
  post_example_writeup: As illustrated by the examples, 「(っ)たって」 is a highly flexible expression. It conveys
    a strong sense of inevitability or dismissal of a condition, regardless of whether the condition itself
    is affirmative or negative. It is typically used in casual speech and often carries a nuanced tone of
    resignation or strong assertion depending on context.
