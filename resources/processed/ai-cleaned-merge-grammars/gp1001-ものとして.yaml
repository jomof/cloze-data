    "writeup": "The expression 「ものとして」 implies a strong determination or assumption. It's often used after verbs and nouns followed by 「な」, and occasionally after い-adjectives. It presents a situation where the speaker determines something is true for the sake of discussion. In English, this may be interpreted as \"supposing that (A)\" or \"on the assumption that (A)\".\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Unlike 「として」 alone, which indicates something is viewed as (A) because it *is* (A), 「ものとして」 uses 「もの」 to take away a degree of definiteness. The word before 「もの」 may not be true, but it is assumed to be true by the speaker.\n*   This expression is generally more formal than 「として」 alone, often used in writing or formal speech.",
    "etymology": "「もの」 refers to 'thing' or 'matter,' indicating something concrete or factual. 「として」 means 'as' or 'in the capacity of.' Combining these creates the meaning of 'treating something as a fact,' hence 'assuming.'",
