jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: pronoun
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used in polite and formal settings, business interactions, customer service, or when
    showing deference. Can refer to directions, locations, or people/groups.
  function: To indicate direction, location, or refer to a person/group in a polite or formal manner.
  nuance: Carries a higher degree of politeness and formality compared to their casual counterparts (こっち,
    そっち, あっち, どっち). They can soften requests and sound more refined.
etymology: These terms are part of the fundamental ko-so-a-do demonstrative series in Japanese. The suffix
  「ら」 (ra) is attached to the older demonstrative roots (こ・そ・あ・ど), which originally served to indicate
  general direction or area. This 「ら」 suffix, similar to how it functions in words like 彼ら (karera - 'they')
  or 我ら (warera - 'we'), lends a more formal or collective nuance, thereby making these forms suitable
  for polite communication about directions, places, or even groups of people.
writeup: "The demonstratives こちら・そちら・あちら・どちら are the formal and polite versions of こっち・そっち・あっち・どっち. They\
  \ are essential for polite communication in Japanese, especially in business, customer service, or any\
  \ situation where respect and formality are required. While they primarily indicate directions or locations,\
  \ they are also commonly used to refer to people or groups in a respectful manner. \n\n*   **こちら** refers\
  \ to the speaker's side, 'this way', or can politely refer to the speaker themselves or their group/company.\
  \ For example, a customer service representative might say 「こちらは〜でございます」 (This is ~) when introducing\
  \ their company.\n*   **そちら** refers to the listener's side, 'that way', or politely refers to the listener\
  \ themselves or their group/company.\n*   **あちら** refers to a direction or place distant from both the\
  \ speaker and listener, 'over there', or politely refers to a third person or group.\n*   **どちら** is\
  \ the interrogative, meaning 'which way', 'where', or 'who' (polite). It's commonly used when asking\
  \ for directions or politely inquiring about someone's origin or preference.\n\nUsing these formal demonstratives\
  \ is crucial for navigating social interactions smoothly in Japan, showing consideration for the listener\
  \ and the context. While the casual forms are suitable for friends and family, the formal forms are\
  \ the default in public and professional settings."

  - term: こっち・そっち・あっち・どっち
    meaning: this way・that way・which way (casual direction/place)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These are the casual counterparts to こちら・そちら・あちら・どちら. While they convey similar directional
      meanings, they are informal and should only be used in casual settings with close friends or family.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:こっち・そっち・あっち・どっち (this way・that way・which way, casual)
  - term: これ・それ・あれ・どれ
    meaning: this・that・that over there・which (things)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike こちら・そちら・あちら・どちら which refer to directions, places, or people, これ・それ・あれ・どれ specifically
      refer to objects or abstract concepts. You would use これ for 'this thing' and こちら for 'this direction'
      or 'this person/side'.
    grammar_point: これ・それ・あれ・どれ (demonstrative pronouns)
  - term: ここ・そこ・あそこ・どこ
    meaning: here・there・over there・where (locations)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both refer to locations, ここ・そこ・あそこ・どこ are more direct and generally indicate a specific
      spot or area. こちら etc. can also indicate a place, but they carry a more formal or deferential nuance,
      often used when referring to a broad area, a company, or a person's general whereabouts, or as a
      polite substitute for ここ in formal contexts.
    grammar_point: ここ・そこ・あそこ・どこ (here・there・over there・where)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between these demonstratives, consider the level of politeness
  required by the situation and what you are referring to. Use こちら・そちら・あちら・どちら for formal situations,
  referring to directions, broader areas, or politely to people/groups. Reserve こっち・そっち・あっち・どっち for casual
  speech. Remember that これ・それ・あれ・どれ are for objects, and ここ・そこ・あそこ・どこ are for specific locations, though
  the formal directional terms can sometimes overlap in meaning with location terms when politeness is
  key.
