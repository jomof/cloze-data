jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: pronoun
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to politely indicate direction, location, or to refer to things or people. Often
    employed in business settings, formal conversations, or when addressing someone with respect.
  function: Spatial deixis and polite reference.
  nuance: These terms are the polite and formal counterparts to the more casual こ・そ・あ・ど series (これ, ここ,
    こっち, etc.). They offer a broader and more courteous scope, capable of referring to directions, locations,
    people, or even groups and sides (e.g., 'your company' when using そちら).
etymology: The こ・そ・あ・ど series forms the fundamental basis of Japanese demonstratives. The suffix -ちら (chirā)
  is believed to derive from words related to 'side' or 'direction,' such as 辺り (atari), meaning 'vicinity'
  or 'around.' Over time, this suffix attached to the demonstrative roots (こ-, そ-, あ-, ど-) to specifically
  indicate a 'direction' or 'side' in a more polite or generalized manner, thus evolving into the current
  forms for polite directional reference.
writeup: |-
  The words こちら, そちら, あちら, and どちら are polite demonstrative pronouns in Japanese. They are used to refer to directions, locations, or even people and things, offering a more formal and respectful alternative to the simpler こ・そ・あ・ど series (これ, それ, あれ, どれ; ここ, そこ, あそこ, どこ; こっち, そっち, あっち, どっち).

  **こちら** indicates 'this way' or 'here,' referring to something close to the speaker. It can also politely introduce oneself or someone (e.g., "This is..." or "I am...").

  **そちら** indicates 'that way' or 'there,' referring to something close to the listener. It is often used to politely refer to the listener's company, department, or side.

  **あちら** indicates 'that way over there' or 'over there,' referring to something distant from both the speaker and the listener. It can also politely refer to a third party or a distant location.

  **どちら** is the interrogative form, meaning 'which way,' 'where,' or 'which one.' It is used when politely asking for directions or making a polite inquiry about a choice among several options.

  These terms are crucial for maintaining appropriate politeness levels, especially in formal situations like business meetings, customer service, or when addressing individuals of higher status. While they primarily denote direction or location, their use to refer to people or organizations highlights their versatility in polite Japanese communication.

  - term: これ・それ・あれ・どれ
    meaning: this・that・that over there・which (things)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These are less formal and refer primarily to objects. こちら・そちら・あちら・どちら are more polite and
      can refer to directions, locations, or people/things.

  - term: ここ・そこ・あそこ・どこ
    meaning: here・there・over there・where (locations)
    kind: similar expression

      and can refer to directions, locations, or people/things, offering a broader and more courteous

  - term: こっち・そっち・あっち・どっち
    meaning: this way・that way・which way (casual)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These are casual versions used for directions or indicating one of two choices. こちら・そちら・あちら・どちら
      are the formal equivalents.
    grammar_point: こっち・そっち・あっち・どっち (this way・that way・which way)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key distinction among these demonstratives lies in their level of formality
  and the scope of what they can refer to. The -ちら forms (こちら, そちら, あちら, どちら) are consistently polite
  and versatile, capable of referring not just to physical directions and locations, but also to people,
  groups, or abstract 'sides.' In contrast, こ・そ・あ・ど (これ, ここ, etc.) and こっ・そっ・あっ・どっ (こっち, そっち, etc.) are
  less formal and tend to be more narrowly focused on objects or specific points/directions, respectively.
  Always choose the -ちら forms in situations requiring politeness or deference.
