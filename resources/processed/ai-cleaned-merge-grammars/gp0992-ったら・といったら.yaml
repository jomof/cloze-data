    "etymology": "「たら」is a conditional form, but in this usage, it intensifies the preceding word or phrase, expressing an extreme degree. 「という」is the plain form of 「といいます」, meaning 'to say'. Together, they create a rhetorical expression emphasizing the speaker's inability to adequately describe something due to its extreme nature.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「ったら」 or 「といったら」 is used to emphasize a very high degree or extent of something, often to the point where it's difficult to express with mere words. It's frequently used in negative contexts to highlight feelings like disappointment, astonishment, or frustration. \n\n*   「ったら」 is typically used with adjectives or nouns.\n*   「といったら」 is a set expression that describes something extreme, often following words that describe negative emotions. \n\nWhile 「ったら」 can be used in both positive and negative contexts, 「といったら」 is generally reserved for negative situations. The variant 「と言ったらありはない」 is a written form that is rarely used in modern conversation.",
