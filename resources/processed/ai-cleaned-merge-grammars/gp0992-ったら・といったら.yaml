    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ったら」 is derived from the conditional form 「～たら」, implying a hypothetical situation that evokes a strong emotional response. 「といったら」 is a variation of 「ったら」, adding 「と言う」 (to say) for emphasis, further highlighting the speaker's inability to articulate the intensity of the situation.",
    "writeup": "「ったら」 and 「といったら」 are set expressions utilized to underscore an extreme degree of something, often to the point where it becomes challenging to articulate in mere words. This construction inherently conveys a profound sense of astonishment, disappointment, or frustration. Unlike simple descriptive phrases, these expressions signify that the speaker is profoundly overwhelmed by the situation. Specifically, 「といったら」 is predominantly employed in negative contexts, frequently following terms that denote something outrageous, absurd, shameful, or pathetic. It should be noted that 「と言ったらありはない」 exists as a less common, more literary variant of this expression.",
