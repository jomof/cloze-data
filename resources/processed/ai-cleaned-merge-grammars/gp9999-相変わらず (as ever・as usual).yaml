jlpt: N3
etymology: 'The term 相変わらず (aikawarazu) is derived from the verb 相変わる (aikawaru), meaning "to change mutually"
  or "to differ from each other," combined with the classical negative auxiliary suffix ず (zu). Thus,
  it literally means "without changing mutually" or "without changing from the usual state." This linguistic
  origin highlights its core meaning: a state or condition that persists as it was before, unchanged.'
writeup: |-
  The adverb 相変わらず (aikawarazu) is used to express that something is "as ever," "as usual," "still," or "as before." It emphasizes the **continuity of a state or action** from a previous point in time to the present. You'll often hear it in daily conversations, particularly when encountering someone after a while or when observing a familiar situation.

  It can modify verbs, adjectives, or even entire clauses. For example, if a friend always loves coffee, and you see them with coffee again, you might say, 「相変わらずコーヒーが好きですね。」 (You still like coffee, don't you?).

  While generally neutral, the nuance of 相変わらず can subtly shift based on context. It can convey:
  *   **Simple observation**: Stating a fact about continuity.
  *   **Relief**: If a difficult situation hasn't worsened, or a positive state remains.
  *   **Mild surprise or disappointment**: If a change was expected but didn't occur.

  It's important to understand that 相変わらず implies a comparison to a previous state that is implicitly known or expected. It's less about frequency (like "always") and more about the *unchanged nature* of something.
false_friends:
  - term: いつも
    meaning: always
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いつも」 refers to frequency or habit, indicating that something happens or is true all the time
      or very frequently. It doesn't specifically imply an *unchanged state* from a prior observation
      in the same way 「相変わらず」 does. We're looking for a state that remains consistent with how it was
      observed before.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:いつも (always)
  - term: まだ
    meaning: still
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「まだ」 indicates that an action or state is ongoing or has not yet occurred. While it conveys
      continuity, it lacks the comparative nuance of "as before" or "as usual" that 「相変わらず」 carries. It
      often implies a process that is incomplete or an expectation that something *might* change.
    grammar_point: まだ (still・not yet)
  - term: 依然として
    meaning: still; as before
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「依然として」 is more formal and typically used in objective or written contexts to describe a situation
      or condition that remains unchanged despite circumstances or the passage of time. It often applies
      to broader situations or problems. 「相変わらず」 is more frequently used in casual conversation, referring
      to personal observations, habits, or the state of familiar people and things.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:依然として (still; as before)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「相変わらず」, 「いつも」, 「まだ」, and 「依然として」 all relate to continuity or persistence,
  their specific nuances and contexts differ. 「相変わらず」 uniquely emphasizes that a situation, person, or
  habit is **exactly as it was observed or expected to be before**, conveying a sense of recognition of
  consistency. 「いつも」 focuses on frequency or routine. 「まだ」 indicates an ongoing or incomplete state. 「依然として」
  is a more formal expression for unchanging objective situations. Choosing the correct term depends on
  whether you want to convey habit, ongoing status, formal persistence, or a familiar, unchanged state.

          - 久し ぶり！君 は いつ も 元気 だ ね！
        english: Long time! You are always energetic, aren't you!
        hint: 「いつも」 focuses on the frequency or habitual nature of being energetic, not necessarily on
          being unchanged from a past observation. We're looking for a state that remains consistent with
          how it was observed before.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 久し ぶり！君 は まだ 元気 だ ね！
        english: Long time! You are still energetic, aren't you!
        hint: 「まだ」 indicates that the state of being energetic is ongoing. It implies current state, but
          less emphasis on "as before" or "as usual". We're looking for a state that remains consistent
          with how it was observed before.
    scene: A person meets an old friend they haven't seen in a while and notices their cheerful personality
      hasn't changed.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly

      previous encounters, conveying a sense of pleasant familiarity. The sentence-final 「ね」 further seeks
      agreement.
    etymology: The combination of 「久しぶり」 (long time no see) and 「相変わらず」 naturally highlights the unchanged
      state after a period of separation.

        english: Even after graduating, that cafe is always popular.
        hint: 「いつも」 implies consistent popularity over a long time, but not necessarily a specific comparison
          to a known past state. We're looking for the sense that it's popular just as it was before.
    scene: A former student revisits their old university town and observes that a local cafe has maintained
      its popularity.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: This sentence highlights the continued popularity of the cafe despite the speaker's absence.
      「相変わらず」 stresses that its popularity hasn't waned, implying that the speaker remembers it being
      popular before.
    etymology: The conjunction 「後も」 (even after) reinforces the idea of persistence, aligning well with
      「相変わらず」.

          as it always has been.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: His cooking is always unbelievably delicious.

          as it always has been.
    scene: Someone is trying food cooked by a friend or family member who is known for their cooking skills
      and finds it just as good as always.

      is remarkable.

        english: Despite the long vacation, my little brother is always lazy.
        hint: 「いつも」 focuses on the habit of being lazy, not specifically on the observation that his laziness
          hasn't changed from a previous time. We're looking for the idea that he hasn't changed.
    scene: A sibling comments on their younger brother's unchanging lazy habits, even after a long break
      where one might expect a change.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    nuance: Here, 「相変わらず」 can carry a slight tone of resignation or mild exasperation, as the brother's
      laziness persists despite the opportunity for change during a long vacation. 「ぐうたら」 is a casual,
      slightly derogatory term for lazy.
    etymology: 「ぐうたら」 (lazy) is a colloquial term, suitable for a casual, slightly complaining tone when
      talking about a family member.

      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 有名 な 俳優 は いつ も ハンサム です ね。
        english: That famous actor is always handsome, isn't he?
        hint: 「いつも」 implies a constant characteristic, but less on the observation of his unchanging state
          over time. We're looking for the sense that he's as handsome as he always was.
    scene: Two friends are watching a TV show or movie featuring a famous actor and comment on his appearance.
    register: casual

          from a specific previous day. We're looking for the idea that the bad weather hasn't changed.
    scene: Two colleagues comment on the persistently bad weather while looking outside.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「相変わらず」 here conveys a neutral observation of the unchanging poor weather, possibly with a

      the continuity described by 「相変わらず」.

    scene: Someone is frustrated by a person's unclear communication, noting that it hasn't improved.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: Here, 「相変わらず」 conveys a sense of frustration or resignation that a problem (difficulty in

          remains unchanged despite a new environment. We're looking for the idea that his attitude hasn't
          changed.
    scene: A senior colleague observes a new hire maintaining their positive attitude despite the challenges
      of starting a new job.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: This implies a positive observation. 「相変わらず」 highlights that his positive attitude (「前向き」)
      has not been diminished by the new environment, which is often seen as a desirable trait in a professional
      setting.
    etymology: 「前向き」 (maemuki - positive, forward-looking) describes an attitude, and its unchanging nature
      is a commendation in this context.
post_example_writeup: These examples illustrate that 「相変わらず」 can be used in a variety of situations, from
  personal greetings to objective observations, and can carry different emotional weights depending on
  the context. Its core function is to highlight continuity and the lack of change from a previously known
  state, making it a versatile adverb in Japanese.
