formation:
  '[Verb (た form)] + 甲斐がある': Expresses that the action was worth doing.
  '[Noun + の] + 甲斐がある': Indicates that the noun's effect or worth exists.
  Verb[masu-stem] + がいがある: Used to denote that a specific action itself is worthwhile or rewarding, often
    implying personal satisfaction or purpose derived from the act itself. This form of 「甲斐」 is often
    pronounced as 「がい」.
jlpt: N2
etymology: 「甲斐」 originally referred to a region in present-day Yamanashi Prefecture, known for its skilled
  warriors. Over time, it came to mean "effectiveness" or "worth," reflecting the region's reputation
  for producing capable individuals.
writeup: The grammar point 「甲斐がある」 expresses that something is "worth doing" or "pays off." 「甲斐」 itself
  means "worth" or "effect." It is often used after verbs or nouns to indicate that an action or effort
  was worthwhile. You will often see it in hiragana as 「かい」 or 「がい」. When following verbs, 「がい」 is used
  after the ます-stem, indicating a general sense of worth. 「かい」 can follow any standard verb form, emphasizing
  the tense of the verb. 「甲斐がない」 means something is "not worth doing." This expression is primarily used
  when the speaker wants to convey that a positive result will come from something that is either difficult
  or unpleasant, validating the effort or hardship.

  - term: やりがい
    meaning: Worth doing, rewarding
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「甲斐がある」, 「やりがい」 specifically refers to the rewarding or fulfilling nature of a task,
      job, or activity, often implying personal satisfaction or motivation derived from the work itself.
      「甲斐がある」 is broader, focusing on the return on effort or value of an action in general.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:やりがい (worthwhile feeling)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「甲斐がある」 implies that an effort or action was worthwhile because it yielded
  a specific, usually positive outcome or payoff. In contrast, 「やりがい」 emphasizes the intrinsic reward
  or satisfaction derived from the process of doing something, regardless of the final outcome. While
  both relate to worth, 「甲斐がある」 is about the result validating the effort, whereas 「やりがい」 is about the
  personal fulfillment found *in* the effort.

          that the whole journey was justified.

          in a famous academic journal.

        english: Even though I worked so hard studying for that exam, it was completely useless. In the
          end, I failed.
        hint: 「無駄だった」 means it was 'useless' or 'a waste,' focusing on the lack of practical result. 「甲斐がなかった」
          carries a stronger nuance of disappointment that the effort itself proved to have no value or
          didn't bring about the desired return, often implying personal emotional impact. We're looking
          for a phrase that conveys the effort was not worthwhile.
    scene: A student expresses their profound disappointment after receiving a failing grade despite extensive
      preparation, feeling their hard work was unrewarded.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of 「あんなに」 ('that much') emphasizes the significant effort put in, making the subsequent
      「全く甲斐がなかった」 ('there was absolutely no worth') sound even more disheartened. This reflects a personal
      lament about unrewarded effort, typical in casual self-reflection.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「甲斐がある」 and its negative form 「甲斐がない」 are used to express
  the worth or lack thereof of an effort or action, often highlighting a sense of payoff or vindication
  for the time and energy invested. The nuanced meanings often distinguish it from simpler expressions
  of cause-and-effect or mere happiness.
