        "nuance": "Presents information as objective or commonly accepted, implying that the speaker is reporting a shared understanding rather than asserting a personal viewpoint."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed by combining the particle 「と」 (to), the verb 「考える」 (kangaeru - to think) in its passive form 「考えられる」 (kangaerareru - to be thought), and the auxiliary verb 「いる」 (iru) in its progressive form 「ている」 (teiru), followed by 「だ」 (da) or 「です」 (desu) to indicate assertion. The passive form shifts the focus away from the agent doing the thinking, emphasizing the widespread nature of the belief or opinion.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「とかんがえられている」 is used to express that something is widely considered or thought to be a certain way. It's often used to present commonly held opinions or beliefs, rather than personal opinions. The passive form 「考えられている」 emphasizes that the thought is not necessarily the speaker's own, but rather a general consensus. This construction is useful for presenting information objectively or highlighting popular beliefs. It can be used interchangeably with 「と思われている」.",

            "nuance": "While {とかんがえられている} suggests a more formal or widely accepted view, {といわれている} typically implies hearsay, rumor, or a common saying, without necessarily indicating broad agreement or objective truth."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「と考えられる」, 「といわれている」, and 「とかんがえられている」 can all express beliefs or opinions, they differ in nuance. Use 「と考えられる」 when presenting a conclusion based on evidence or a logical deduction. Opt for 「といわれている」 when referring to rumors, hearsay, or common sayings. Use 「とかんがえられている」 when stating a widely accepted or established belief or consideration.",
