    "etymology": "This grammar point is a combination of 「と」 (a particle indicating content), 「考えられる」 (kangaerareru - the passive form of 'to think'), and 「いる」 (iru - to be, in progressive form). The passive form indicates that the thought or consideration is not necessarily the speaker's own, but rather a general consensus.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「とかんがえられている」, is used to express that something is considered or thought of in a particular way. It's typically used to highlight a commonly held opinion or belief that most people agree on, rather than expressing a personal opinion. The passive form 「考えられている」 ('is considered') is used to indicate that the thought itself is not necessarily the speaker's own. While it's often used to present objective information, it can also be used to subtly strengthen one's own opinion, similar to saying \"everyone knows that...\" in English. It is a standard register expression, commonly used in general contexts. The polite form 「とかんがえられています」is also frequently used, particularly in formal speech or writing.",
