formation:
  い-Adjective (minus い) + ければ: Forms the conditional 'if it is [い-Adjective]' or 'if [い-Adjective]'.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The conditional form 「ければ」 for い-adjectives originates from classical Japanese. The '已然形' (izenkei),
  or realis form, of an い-adjective like 「白い」 (shiroi) is 「白けれ」 (shirokere). When the classical conditional
  particle 「ば」, which indicated a general or natural consequence, was affixed to this '已然形', it formed
  「白ければ」. This structure has persisted in modern Japanese to express 'if it is white' or 'if it were white',
  linking a state described by an い-adjective to a subsequent outcome.
writeup: |-
  The 「ければ」 form is used to create conditional clauses with い-adjectives. It means 'if it is [adjective]' or 'if [adjective]'. This conditional form is typically used when the condition naturally leads to the stated result, expressing a general truth, a logical consequence, or providing advice based on an adjectival state.

  For example, if something is 'expensive', then it might lead to a natural consequence like 'you can't buy it'. Or, if a task is 'easy', it might mean 'anyone can do it'. This form emphasizes the inherent quality described by the い-adjective as the necessary condition for the following clause.

  It is formed by dropping the final 「い」 from the い-adjective and adding 「ければ」. For instance, 「高い」 (takai - expensive) becomes 「高ければ」 (takakereba - if it's expensive), and 「難しい」 (muzukashii - difficult) becomes 「難しければ」 (muzukukereba - if it's difficult).

  While versatile, 「ければ」 is often seen in more general statements or when giving advice. Its natural consequence aspect makes it suitable for describing inherent relationships between a quality and an outcome.
false_friends:
  - term: たら (conditional・when if A then B)
    meaning: if/when A, then B
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たら」 is a highly versatile conditional that can express a one-time condition, a general condition,
      or even an unexpected outcome following an event ('when A happened, then B'). For い-adjectives,
      it forms as 『い-Adjective stem + かったら』. Unlike 「ければ」, which focuses on the adjectival state as a
      prerequisite for a natural consequence, 「たら」 is more flexible and can describe a wider range of
      conditional relationships, including hypothetical or completed actions.
    grammar_point: たら (conditional, when・if A then B)
  - term: と (conditional・inevitable result)
    meaning: if/when A, B (always happens)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「と」 is used for universal truths or automatic, inevitable results, implying a direct, unavoidable
      cause-and-effect relationship. For い-adjectives, it forms as 『い-Adjective stem + いと』. While 「ければ」
      also expresses natural consequences, 「と」 implies an absolute and unchanging certainty, often used
      for scientific facts or habitual actions, whereas 「ければ」 is more commonly applied to personal judgments,
      advice, or less rigidly inevitable outcomes.
    grammar_point: と (conditional, inevitable result)
  - term: なら (conditional・if it's the case that A)
    meaning: if (it's the case that) A, then B
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なら」 presents a condition based on a stated premise or proposition (which can be an い-adjective
      followed by 「なら」, e.g., 『い-Adjective + なら』). It often implies advice, a suggestion, or a response
      to a specific situation that has been brought up. 「ければ」 focuses on the inherent quality of the い-adjective
      as the condition, directly leading to a consequence. 「なら」, however, often implies 'if that's the
      case, then...' offering a counter-statement or a logical next step based on the listener's premise,
      rather than a universal truth.
    grammar_point: なら (conditional, if it's the case that A)
  - term: ても (concessive・even if)
    meaning: even if/though A, B
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「〜ても」 expresses a concession or an unexpected outcome. It means 'even if the condition A is
      met, B still happens (or doesn't happen), contrary to expectation'. For い-adjectives, it forms as
      『い-Adjective stem + くても』. This grammatical pattern functions oppositely to a conditional like 「ければ」,
      which suggests that the adjectival state A *leads* to result B. Instead, 「〜ても」 implies that A does
      *not* prevent B.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ても (concessive・even if)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between these conditional forms, consider the nuance. 「ければ」
  is ideal for expressing that an い-adjective's quality is a necessary and logical condition for a subsequent
  outcome, often in general statements or advice. If you're talking about a one-time hypothetical, a sequential
  event, or an unexpected result, 「たら」 might be more appropriate. For universal, unavoidable truths, use
  「と」. When responding to a specific situation with advice or a counter-statement, 「なら」 is your choice.
  Lastly, if you want to express 'even if' a condition is met, use 「〜ても」.
examples:
  - english: If the weather is good, let's go for a walk.
    japanese:
      - 天気 が {よけれ ば}、散歩 に 行こう。
      - 天気 が {よけれ ば}、散歩 に 行き ましょう。

        english: If the weather is good (in that case), let's go for a walk.
        hint: While 「なら」 can also express a condition, it often focuses on a premise or an assumption.
          「ければ」 here emphasizes the inherent quality of 'good weather' as the condition for going for
          a walk. We're looking for a natural consequence.

        english: When the bag is light, I can always carry it.
        hint: 「と」 suggests an automatic or universal result. Here, it's more about a personal capability
          based on a condition rather than an absolute rule. We're looking for a general condition for
          a personal action.
    scene: Someone is struggling with a heavy bag, and another person offers help.

        english: If the room becomes bright, it's easy to read.
        hint: 「たら」 can suggest a sequential event (when it *becomes* bright). 「ければ」 emphasizes the inherent
          state of 'brightness' as the constant condition making reading easy. We're looking for a general
          truth.

        english: Even if the train is fast, we won't arrive quickly.
        hint: 「ても」 expresses a concession, meaning the first clause does not lead to the expected outcome.
          We're looking for a direct conditional relationship where the speed *does* affect arrival time.

        english: When the temperature is high, you must always stay hydrated.
        hint: 「と」 implies an absolute and inevitable consequence, like a scientific law. Here, it's more
          of a strong recommendation based on a condition, not a strict 'always' rule. We're looking for
          advice based on a specific state.

        hint: 「なら」 often gives advice or a suggestion based on an existing premise. 「ければ」 here states
          the condition 'being dark' directly leading to the action of turning on the lights. We're looking
          for a direct instruction based on a state.

          - 危ない と、一人 で 行き ませ ん。
        english: When it's dangerous, one doesn't go alone (automatic consequence).
        hint: 「と」 indicates an inevitable or habitual outcome. Here, it's a strong piece of advice or
          warning, not an automatic consequence. We're looking for a conditional leading to a recommendation
          not to do something.
    scene: An older sister warning her younger brother.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「危なければ」 (if it's dangerous) establishes the condition for the cautionary advice. The imperative
      「行かないでください」 (please don't go) is direct and common in warnings. The female speaker and male listener
      is not directly marked by language here, but the direct advice tone fits this relationship.

        hint: 「たら」 often implies a single, realized condition (e.g., *after* tasting and finding it delicious).
          「ければ」 focuses on the inherent quality of being delicious as the general condition for eating
          a lot. We're looking for a general intention based on a quality.

        english: If it's cheap (in that case), I want to buy it.
        hint: 「なら」 often implies a decision based on an assumed fact. 「ければ」 directly links the quality
          of 'cheapness' to the desire to buy. We're looking for a desire based on an inherent characteristic.

        english: When it's small, it is always easy to carry.
        hint: While 「と」 can work for general truths, 「ければ」 feels more natural for expressing a quality-based
          advantage in general. 「と」 is often more rigid for inherent laws. We're looking for a general
          statement of convenience based on size.

        english: Even if the story is interesting, I won't read it.
        hint: 「ても」 expresses a contradiction or an unexpected outcome. Here, we want to express that 'interesting'
          is the condition *for* reading. We're looking for a positive causal relationship.
    scene: A person is choosing a book to read.

    setting: reflective
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「ければ」 is used when the quality described by the い-adjective
  directly and naturally influences the outcome. It's often for general statements, advice, or expressing
  personal intentions contingent on a specific attribute. While other conditional forms exist, 「ければ」 highlights
  the inherent nature of the い-adjective as the core of the condition.
