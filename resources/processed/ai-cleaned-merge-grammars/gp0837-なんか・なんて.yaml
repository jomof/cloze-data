    "etymology": "なんか is thought to be related to the adverbial particle など. なんて is considered an abbreviation of などという 'to say something like'. Both serve to indicate examples or express a feeling about something.",
    "writeup": "**なんか** and **なんて** are Japanese expressions frequently associated with the adverbial particle **など**. They often have overlapping meanings, with **なんか** itself sometimes considered an adverbial particle. **なんて** can be viewed as an extension, an abbreviation of **などという** ('to say something like'). Both are used similarly to **など**, translating to \"such as\" or \"things like\". The main distinction is that **なんて** is more common after **用言** (conjugatable words: verbs, *i*-adjectives, *na*-adjectives), while **なんか** is primarily used after **体言** (unconjugatable words: nouns). However, many native speakers may not consider it incorrect to use either with any word type.\n\nBoth **なんか** and **なんて** can also express a low evaluation. This can convey humility when referring to oneself, or be insulting when referring to others. Despite this potential nuance, many native speakers use them simply as filler words in modern Japanese.",
