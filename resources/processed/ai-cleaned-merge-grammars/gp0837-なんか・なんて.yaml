    "etymology": "なんか and なんて are derived from など. なんて can be considered an abbreviation of などという (nado to iu), meaning \"to say something like.\"",
    "writeup": "**なんか (nanka)** and **なんて (nante)** are colloquial particles used to express a range of emotions, including surprise, disdain, incredulity, or even a sense of humility. They often translate to \"something like,\" \"such as,\" or are used for emphasis.\n\n    While both can be used similarly to **など (nado)**, there are subtle differences:\n\n    *   **なんか** is generally used after nouns (**体言 / taigen**).\n    *   **なんて** is more frequently used after verbs, i-adjectives, and na-adjectives (**用言 / yougen**), often in their plain form.\n\n    However, this distinction is not always strictly observed.\n\n    **Important Considerations:**\n\n    *   Both **なんか** and **なんて** can express a low evaluation of the preceding word. This can be used for self-deprecation or, conversely, to insult others. Be mindful of the context and tone.\n    *   In modern Japanese, these words are also used as filler words to fill silence.\n    *   **なんて** can also be used to express strong feelings about something, positive or negative.",
