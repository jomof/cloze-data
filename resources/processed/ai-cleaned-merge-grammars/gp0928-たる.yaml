    "etymology": "たる is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb たり. たり itself is a contraction of the case marking particle と and あり (to be). This can be compared to なり, which is a contraction of に と あり.",
    "writeup": "**たる** is an attributive form derived from the classical auxiliary verb **たり**, meaning 'to be' or 'to exist'. This form indicates that something holds a specific role, qualification, or status. It is typically used in formal or literary contexts and often conveys a sense of inherent quality, responsibility, or expectation associated with that position. It can be translated as 'in the position of (A)', 'as an (A)', or 'one who is (A)'. Unlike the general copula である, **たる** places a strong emphasis on the qualifications, inherent nature, or responsibilities tied to the role being described, rather than merely stating a fact.\n\nWhen used as **たるに**, it forms a phrase meaning 'in the position of (A)' or 'as an (A)', emphasizing the capacity or role in which an action or state occurs. It typically appears after a noun designating a role, followed by a statement concerning that role.\n\nWhen combined with 者 (mono), forming **たる者** (**たるもの**), it specifically refers to 'a person in the position of (A)' or 'one who is (A)'. This construction is used to describe what is appropriate or expected of someone holding that particular position. It can be translated as 'for' or 'as' in this context.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nWhile **たる** relates to the suitability of something being in a specific position, do not confuse it with the u-verb 足る (tariru), which means 'to be sufficient' or 'to be worthy'. Although semantically related in some contexts, their grammatical structures and primary usages differ.",
