    "writeup": "「たる」 is a formal expression indicating someone's position, role, or the qualifications expected of them. It's similar to 「である」 but places more emphasis on the responsibilities and qualities associated with a particular role.\n\nThe structure 「A たる B」 means \"B in the position of A\" or \"B as an A.\" 「A たる者」 specifically means \"a person in the position of A\" and often describes what is appropriate for someone in that role. The expression is **formal** and somewhat **archaic**, lending a sense of gravity to the statement. You will most commonly encounter this pattern in writing rather than speech.\n\n*   たる is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb たり.\n*   たり itself is a contraction of the case marking particle と and あり \"to be\", which can be compared to なり, a contraction of に and あり.",
    "etymology": "「たる」 comes from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「たり」, which signifies a completed action or state. Over time, it evolved to express a sense of being in a particular state or position, carrying with it the implications and responsibilities associated with that state.",
