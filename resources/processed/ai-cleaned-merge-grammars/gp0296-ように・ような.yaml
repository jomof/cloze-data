    "etymology": "「よう」 comes from 様(さま), meaning \"state\" or \"appearance.\" Thus, 「ように」 and 「ような」 indicate something being in a certain \"state\" or \"appearance,\" hence \"like\" or \"similar to.\" Over time, its usage expanded to include purpose or goal, as achieving a goal means reaching a desired 'state' or 'manner'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ように・ような」 expresses similarity or likeness. 「ような」 modifies nouns, while 「ように」 modifies verbs, adjectives, or even entire clauses adverbially. It is used to describe something as being *like* something else, either in appearance, manner, or condition. It can also express uncertainty, similar to \"as if\" or \"as though.\" Furthermore, 「ように」 is frequently used to express a purpose or a goal, indicating the manner in which an action is performed to achieve a certain state or outcome. This structure is versatile, allowing for both direct comparisons and more nuanced resemblances or goal-oriented expressions.",

Expressions such as 「そう」 indicate an immediate sensory impression or likelihood, whereas 「ように・ような」 can be based on a more considered assessment or an inherent quality. Furthermore, 「ように」 uniquely carries the additional function of expressing purpose or a desired state, which distinguishes it from purely comparative expressions.
