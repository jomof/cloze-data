    "etymology": "「よう」 comes from 様(さま), meaning \"state\" or \"appearance.\" Thus, 「ように」 and 「ような」 indicate something being in a certain \"state\" or \"appearance,\" hence \"like\" or \"similar to.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ように・ような」 expresses similarity or likeness. 「ような」 modifies nouns, while 「ように」 modifies verbs. It is used to describe something as being *like* something else, either in appearance, manner, or condition. It can also express uncertainty, similar to \"as if\" or \"as though.\" This structure is versatile, allowing for both direct comparisons and more nuanced resemblances.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While many expressions can convey similarity in Japanese, it is crucial to distinguish their nuances. 「ように・ような」 generally indicates a more direct and perhaps closer comparison than options like 「みたい」 or 「ふうに」. Expressions such as 「そう」 indicate an immediate sensory impression or likelihood, whereas 「ように・ような」 can be based on a more considered assessment or an inherent quality.
