jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  usage-context: General
etymology: The term 「ますます」 originates from the reduplication of 「増す」 (masu), a verb meaning "to increase."
  This etymology highlights the expression's core meaning of continuous growth or intensification. While
  sometimes written as 「益々」, using the kanji 「益」 (meaning "gain" or "benefit") doesn't alter the nuance;
  the hiragana form 「ますます」 is more common. This doubling emphasizes the progressive nature of the change.
writeup: The adverb 「ますます」 signifies an ongoing trend, translating to "increasingly," "more and more,"
  or "to keep (doing)." It emphasizes the continuation of a state or action and often appears at the beginning
  of a sentence. While the kanji form 「益々」 exists, it is less frequent, and the meaning remains identical.
  The core idea stems from 「増す」 (to increase), so 「ますます」 commonly modifies verbs indicating change or
  adjectives that intensify. While it can also be used to express a decrease (e.g., "less and less"),
  it still implies an **increase** in the degree of that negative state. For instance, 「ますます悪くなる」 means
  "to get increasingly worse," which signifies an increase in the badness.

  - term: 更に
    meaning: Even more or further, again, more and more
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「更に」 can mean "even more," it often implies adding to something already present, whereas
      「ますます」 emphasizes a continuous, evolving trend.
    grammar_point: 更に (even more)
  - term: どんどん
    meaning: Progressively, rapidly increasing, more and more
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「どんどん」 suggests a rapid or forceful progression, unlike 「ますます」, which indicates a more gradual
      and steady change.
    grammar_point: どんどん (rapidly・progressively)
  - term: ば〜ほど
    meaning: The more…the more
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ば〜ほど」 expresses a proportional relationship ("the more X, the more Y"), while 「ますます」 simply
      signifies a continuous increase or decrease.
    grammar_point: ば〜ほど (the more...the more)
  - term: 一方だ
    meaning: More and more, continue to, keep on, -er and -er
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「一方だ」 emphasizes a one-directional trend, often with a sense of inevitability, whereas 「ますます」
      simply highlights the continuous nature of the change without necessarily implying a specific outcome.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]一方だ (more and more・continuous change)'
post_false_friends_writeup: 「ますます」 expresses a state or change that continues and increasingly intensifies.
  It is suitable for emphasizing qualitative changes and ongoing progression, not merely an increase in
  quantity. 「更に」 indicates an additional increase or a further stage. 「どんどん」 emphasizes the speed or force
  of a change. 「ば～ほど」 expresses a proportional relationship. 「一方だ」 suggests that a change is progressing
  in one direction. While these expressions are similar, understanding the nuances of each is crucial.

      state as time progresses. 「不安になる」 (to become anxious) intensifies with 「ますます」, expressing a continuous
      build-up of nervousness. The internal monologue implies a reflective and personal experience. While
      the expression itself is gender-neutral, a female speaker might use it in an internal monologue
      as suggested by the listener being 'no one'.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in the examples, 「ますます」 is versatile and can be used with both positive
  and negative developments, always emphasizing a continuous, intensifying trend. Pay attention to the
  verbs and adjectives it modifies to grasp the full nuance of the sentence.
