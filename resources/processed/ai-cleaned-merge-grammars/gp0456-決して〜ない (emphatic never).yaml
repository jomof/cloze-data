details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: formal
  usage-context: General
  function: Emphatically negates a statement or action, conveying absolute refusal, impossibility, or
    certainty of non-occurrence.
  nuance: Strongly emphasizes the negative, implying a resolute decision or an absolute truth. It is stronger
    than simply using 'nai' or 'masen' alone.
etymology: The term 「決して」 comes from the て-form of the verb 「決する」 (kessuru), meaning "to decide" or "to
  determine". Thus, 「決して」 implies a strong decision or determination *not* to do something.
writeup: 「決して〜ない」 (kesshite ~ nai) is used to express a strong negation, meaning "never," "by no means,"
  or "under no circumstances." 「決して」 functions as an adverb that emphasizes the negative statement. It
  can appear at the beginning of a sentence or directly before the verb it modifies. While the translation
  is often "never", the literal sense is closer to "decidedly not" or "assuredly not". Note that 「決して」
  is often used with negative verb forms 「〜ない」 but can also be used with other structures like 「〜ものか」
  to strongly emphasize rejection or impossibility. For example, 「決して許さない」 means "I will never forgive
  you."

    scene: Someone reflecting on their life path, reaffirming their decisions.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: This expresses a strong, principled stance about accepting past decisions. The female speaker's
      reflective tone, combined with 「決して」 in 「後悔 し ない」, highlights an inner strength and unwavering self-assurance
      in her life's trajectory.
post_example_writeup: As you can see, 「決して〜ない」 consistently conveys a strong, resolute negation, often
  implying a principled stance or an absolute truth. It is important to distinguish it from other negative
  expressions that might focus on frequency, degree, or logical impossibility. The choice of verb form
  (plain or polite, present or past) will follow the standard rules of conjugation, but the core meaning
  of 「決して」 remains an emphatic 'never' or 'by no means'.
