Its various usages, from setting conditions to defining the extent of knowledge or a physical boundary, all stem from this core concept of limitation.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「限り」 (kagiri) is a versatile expression that conveys the idea of \"as long as\" or \"while a certain condition is met.\" It emphasizes the **limitations** or **scope** within which something is true or valid.\n\nThere are a few common ways 「限り」 is used:\n\n*   **Limited To:** This indicates that something (B) is confined within the scope of (A). For instance, 「今週 末 限り」 means \"limited to this weekend.\"\n*   **As Far As:** This highlights that within a specific source of information (A), (B) is true. This scope often relates to sensory input or knowledge, such as 「私 が 知る 限り」 (as far as I know) or 「見渡す 限り」 (as far as the eye can see).\n*   **While (A) Is the Case:** This suggests that if (A) is true, then (B) needs to be considered. It implies that (B) is contingent upon (A), as in 「彼 が 謝ら ない 限り」 (as long as he doesn't apologize).\n*   **To the Utmost Extent:** It can also be used to express doing something to the fullest extent of one's ability, like 「力 の 限り」 (to the best of one's ability).\n\nDespite these various meanings, 「限り」 consistently underscores that (A) is the boundary or limitation within which (B) exists. While often used in formal contexts, its derived forms and idiomatic expressions can also appear in casual speech.",
