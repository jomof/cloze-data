    "writeup": "The grammar point 「限り」 (kagiri) is a versatile expression that conveys the idea of \"as long as\" or \"while a certain condition is met.\" It emphasizes the **limitations** or **scope** within which something is true or valid.\n\nThere are a few common ways 「限り」 is used:\n\n*   **Limited To:** This indicates that something (B) is confined within the scope of (A).\n*   **As Far As:** This highlights that within a specific source of information (A), (B) is true. This scope often relates to sensory input or knowledge.\n*   **While (A) Is the Case:** This suggests that if (A) is true, then (B) needs to be considered. It implies that (B) is contingent upon (A).\n\nDespite these various meanings, 「限り」 consistently underscores that (A) is the boundary or limitation within which (B) exists.",
