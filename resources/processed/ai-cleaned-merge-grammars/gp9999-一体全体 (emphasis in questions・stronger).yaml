pronunciation:
  katakana: イッタイゼンタイ
  romaji: ittai zentai
formation:
  一体全体 + interrogative word (e.g., 何, どこ, 誰, いつ, どうして): Used to express strong surprise, exasperation,
    or confusion, intensifying the interrogative word.
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: casual
  function: Emphasizes a question; expresses strong doubt, surprise, exasperation, or confusion.
  nuance: Carries a much stronger and often more emotional (e.g., exasperated, bewildered) nuance than
    「一体」 alone. It implies that the speaker finds the situation completely unbelievable or inexplicable.
etymology: The term 「一体全体」 is a compound of 「一体 (ittai)」 and 「全体 (zentai)」. 「一体」 originally meant 'one
  body' or 'one form,' evolving to signify 'in general' or 'after all,' and eventually adopting an interrogative
  emphatic sense of 'what in the world.' 「全体」 means 'the whole' or 'entirety.' When combined, 「一体全体」 intensifies
  the meaning of 'what in the world' to emphasize the completeness or utter inexplicable nature of the
  question, almost as if asking 'what *the entire* world is happening here?' This combination reinforces
  the rhetorical force, making the question more emphatic and emotionally charged.
writeup: 「一体全体」 is an emphatic adverb used to express strong emotions such as surprise, exasperation,
  confusion, or deep curiosity when asking a question. It is a more potent and emotionally charged version
  of 「一体」 (ittai) alone. While 「一体」 can convey a sense of 'what in the world,' adding 「全体」 amplifies this
  feeling, suggesting a complete and utter bewilderment. This phrase typically precedes an interrogative
  word such as 「何 (なに - what)」, 「どこ (どこ - where)」, 「誰 (だれ - who)」, 「いつ (いつ - when)」, or 「どうして (どうして -
  why)」. It is most commonly used in casual or informal contexts due to its strong emotional tone, but
  can appear in more formal settings when the speaker's bewilderment or frustration is very high. It implies
  that the speaker finds the situation or question utterly baffling and is searching for a comprehensive
  explanation.

  - term: 一体 (emphasis in questions)
    meaning: What in the world; after all (emphasis in questions)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「一体」 also emphasizes questions, but 「一体全体」 provides a stronger, more exasperated, or utterly
      bewildered nuance.
    grammar_point: 一体 (emphasis in questions)
  - term: まさか (masaka)
    meaning: Impossible; no way
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「まさか」 expresses disbelief, it usually functions as an interjection or an adverb modifying
      a negative statement. 「一体全体」 is specifically used to intensify direct questions.
    grammar_point: まさか (no way)
  - term: 果たして (hatashite)
    meaning: As expected; really; truly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「果たして」 is used to express doubt or to confirm an expectation, often like 'I wonder if... truly...'
      or 'will it really...?' It doesn't carry the same sense of exasperation or utter confusion as 「一体全体」.
    grammar_point: はたして (really; as expected)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「一体」, 「まさか」, and 「果たして」 all deal with elements of doubt, surprise, or
  inquiry, 「一体全体」 uniquely combines a strong interrogative function with a high degree of speaker bewilderment
  or frustration. 「一体」 serves as a milder intensifier. 「まさか」 expresses disbelief often independent of
  a direct question, and 「果たして」 questions or confirms expectations rather than expressing utter confusion.
