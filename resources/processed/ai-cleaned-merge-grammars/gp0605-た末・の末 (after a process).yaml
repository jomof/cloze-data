    "etymology": "The word 「末」 (matsu/sue) itself means \"end,\" \"tip,\" or \"extremity.\" In this grammar point, it is used to express the idea of reaching the end point of a process, deliberation, or period of time, after which a particular result or conclusion is reached. The particle の before 末 is a possessive marker, signifying that the 'end' belongs to the preceding noun. The た form before 末 indicates a completed action, leading to the nuance of an action's 'end' or 'culmination'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「た末・の末」 (ta sue / no sue) indicates that a certain result or conclusion has been reached after a significant period of prior action, effort, or deliberation. It is formed by attaching 「末」 to the past form of a verb (Vた形) or to a noun followed by the particle 「の」.\n\nWhile this pattern can be translated simply as \"after (A), (B)\" or \"as a result of (A), (B),\" its core nuance lies in highlighting the exhaustive or culminating nature of the preceding process. It suggests that various things happened along the way, or considerable effort was expended, before finally arriving at the outcome. The result can be either positive or negative, but the emphasis is always on the long-lasting effort, struggle, or thought process that eventually led to the subsequent event.\n\nConsider this pattern when you wish to convey that a consequence or decision is the direct outcome of a thorough or prolonged prior condition, rather than simply a sequential event.",

It is not a simple marker of 'afterness,' but rather conveys that the outcome was achieved *as a result* of a significant period of time, effort, or deliberation. The implication is that the preceding period was meaningful and directly contributed to the final state. If the effort, struggle, or deep consideration in the preceding action is crucial to the meaning you wish to convey, then 「た末・の末」 is the appropriate and precise choice.",
