        "part-of-speech": "auxiliary verb",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Primarily used in formal or literary contexts, especially in writing. It sounds stiff in casual conversation.",
        "function": "Indicates simultaneous actions or an ongoing state. Can also convey a concessive meaning ('although').",
        "nuance": "Implies a continuous, often sustained, accompanying action or state. More formal than ながら, and generally not used for momentary, physical actions happening in parallel."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「つつ」 is derived from the verb 「つむ」 (tsumu), which means \"to spin\" or \"to weave.\" The idea is that you are weaving two actions together simultaneously. It's also related to the verb 「続ける」 (tsuzukeru), meaning \"to continue,\" suggesting an ongoing state or action.",
    "writeup": "「つつ」 is a formal grammatical construction used to indicate two actions happening simultaneously or an action that continues over time. It is commonly translated as \"while\" or \"and.\" This form is found more frequently in written Japanese than in spoken Japanese. Unlike 「ながら」, 「つつ」 is often employed when the primary action (the one preceding 「つつ」) denotes an ongoing state, a mental process, or a sustained condition, rather than a physical movement. For instance, expressing \"while thinking\" (考えつつ) is natural, whereas \"while running\" (走りつつ) for a simultaneous physical act would typically sound less natural than 「走りながら」. However, the action following 「つつ」 (the main clause) can be either a physical movement or an ongoing state. This structure also carries a concessive nuance, similar to \"although\" or \"even though,\" especially when paired with 「も」 (e.g., 知りつつも - \"although knowing\"). Due to its formal nature, using 「つつ」 in casual conversation can sound stiff or unnatural.",

            "meaning": "While ~ing, During, As",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「つつ」, 「ながら」 can be used for both physical motions and ongoing states, making it more versatile and common in everyday speech. 「つつ」 is more formal and often implies an ongoing state or a sustained action rather than concurrent physical activities."

            "meaning": "While you are at it, On the occasion",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ついでに」 implies doing something additional or convenient at the same time as another action, often an unrelated one. It doesn't mean the actions are directly related or happening continuously like with 「つつ」, but rather taking advantage of an opportunity."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ながら」, 「つつ」, and 「ついでに」 all involve performing actions at the same time, they possess distinct nuances and formality levels. 「ながら」 is the most versatile and commonly used, particularly for simultaneous physical actions. 「つつ」 is more formal and typically describes an ongoing state or a sustained, often mental, action. 「ついでに」 signifies undertaking an additional, convenient task. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for appropriate usage in various contexts.",
