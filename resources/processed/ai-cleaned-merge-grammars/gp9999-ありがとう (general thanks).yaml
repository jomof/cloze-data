  Fixed Expression: A set phrase used to express thanks.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The word "ありがとう" comes from the classical Japanese adjective "有り難し (arigatashi)". This adjective
  is a compound of "有り (ari)", meaning "to exist" or "to be", and "難し (katashi)", meaning "difficult".
  Therefore, "有り難し" originally meant "difficult to exist" or "rare and precious". Over time, this evolved
  to express the feeling of gratitude for something that is rare or valuable, leading to its current meaning
  of "thank you". The transition from "arigatashi" to "arigatō" reflects a shift from an adjectival form
  to an adverbial form (ありがたく > ありがとう) used to modify the implied "ございます" (gozaimasu) or "ございまする" (gozaimasuru),
  meaning "it is". So, "ありがとう ございます" literally means "it is a rare and precious thing."
writeup: |-
  "ありがとう" is the most common and versatile way to express gratitude in Japanese. It is a fundamental expression you will hear and use constantly. While often translated simply as "thank you," its historical roots give it a deeper nuance.

  As explained in its etymology, "ありがとう" stems from the classical adjective "有り難し (arigatashi)," which literally meant "difficult to exist" or "rare and precious." This means that when you say "ありがとう," you are fundamentally acknowledging that the kindness, help, or gift you received is something valuable and not to be taken for granted; it is something rare or precious.

  "ありがとう" can be used in a wide range of situations, from casual interactions with friends and family to slightly more formal settings. However, it is generally considered less formal than "ありがとうございます" and other polite forms. It is suitable for everyday use among peers, in casual service encounters, or when expressing quick thanks.

  It's important to remember that while "ありがとう" is versatile, selecting the appropriate level of politeness is crucial in Japanese communication. For situations requiring higher respect or formality, you should opt for "ありがとうございます" or other keigo expressions.

  While "ありがとう" is a general expression of thanks, Japanese offers various ways to convey gratitude, each with its own nuance and level of formality.

  **"どうも (dōmo)"** is highly versatile and can mean "thanks," "hello," or "sorry," depending on context. It's more casual and less specific than "ありがとう," often used for brief acknowledgments or when a subtle expression of gratitude is sufficient. For instance, a simple nod and "どうも" might suffice when a shop assistant hands you a bag.

  **"すみません (sumimasen)"** is commonly used as "excuse me" or "I'm sorry," but it can also convey gratitude. When used for thanks, it often implies "I'm sorry to have troubled you" or "I feel obliged for your effort." It's suitable for small favors, like someone holding a door for you, where "ありがとう" might feel a little too direct or strong.

  **"ありがとうございます (arigatō gozaimasu)"** is the polite form of "ありがとう." The addition of "ございます (gozaimasu)," a polite form of the verb "to be," elevates the expression to a more formal and respectful level. It's generally safer to use "ありがとうございます" in most public or professional settings, with strangers, or when you wish to convey genuine respect and deeper gratitude.

  Understanding these distinctions allows for more natural and appropriate communication in Japanese.

      a slightly different rhythm while retaining the same strong, intimate gratitude.

    japanese:
      - '{ありがとう}、来 て よかっ た よ。'

  appreciate its usage. While simple, it forms the basis for more complex expressions of gratitude in
  Japanese, emphasizing the value of the received kindness.
