    "etymology": "のに is a combination of the particle の, which nominalizes the preceding verb (turns it into a noun-like phrase), and the particle に, which indicates direction or purpose. Thus, のに literally means \"to that which is (A)\", which can be interpreted as \"in order to (A)\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar point のに has two primary functions. It can mean \"despite\" (expressing something contrary to expectation), or \"in order to\" (expressing a purpose or requirement). We will focus on the \"in order to\" meaning here.\n\nTo use のに, simply attach it to the dictionary form of a verb to express that verb as the goal or purpose. Following this, state the conditions or requirements needed to achieve that goal.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   のに always connects two clauses, indicating a relationship of purpose between them.",
