    "etymology": "のに is a combination of the particle の, which nominalizes the preceding verb (turns it into a noun-like phrase), and the particle に, which indicates direction or purpose. Thus, のに literally means \"to that which is (A)\", which can be interpreted as \"in order to (A)\". This structure inherently suggests a goal or destination for an action or state.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point のに has two primary functions. It can mean \"despite\" (expressing something contrary to expectation), or \"in order to\" (expressing a purpose or requirement). In this lesson, we will focus exclusively on the \"in order to\" meaning.\n\nTo use のに, simply attach it to the dictionary form of a verb to express that verb as the goal or purpose. The clause that follows then describes the conditions or requirements needed to achieve that goal, or the effort/time expended for that goal.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   のに always connects two clauses, establishing a relationship where the first clause (before のに) is the purpose or goal for the action/state described in the second clause.\n*   It often highlights the *effort*, *time*, or *means* involved in achieving the purpose.",
