    "jlpt": "N3",
    "meaning": "In order to",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "usage-context": "Generally used to express the purpose or objective for an action, or the effort/time/means required to achieve a goal. It can also imply a negative consequence of the time or effort spent on an action.",
        "function": "To specify the purpose or requirement for an action described in the main clause.",
        "nuance": "This grammatical construction often emphasizes the process, effort, or means involved in achieving a goal. It is distinct from ために, which often highlights the direct benefit or result for an object or outcome, and には, which typically expresses a necessary condition or prerequisite.",
        "grammatical-role": "Connects a clause describing a goal/purpose to a clause describing the means or time/effort required."
    },
    "etymology": "のに is a combination of the particle の, which nominalizes the preceding verb (turning it into a noun-like phrase), and the particle に, which indicates direction or purpose. Thus, のに literally means \"to that which is (A)\", which can be interpreted as \"in order to (A)\". This structure inherently suggests a goal or destination for an action or state.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point のに is primarily used to express a purpose, objective, or the necessary means for an action. It is constructed by attaching のに to the plain (dictionary) form of a verb. The clause preceding のに indicates the goal, and the clause that follows describes the conditions, time, or effort required to achieve that goal.\n\n**Key Usages:**\n\n*   **Expressing Purpose:** It clearly states the reason or aim behind an action. For instance, if you bought something *in order to* read, のに would connect the act of reading to the purchase.\n*   **Indicating Effort or Time:** のに can highlight the amount of effort, time, or resources expended in the process of achieving something. It often appears in sentences describing how much time it took to complete a task, or how difficult something was to do.\n*   **Necessary Conditions/Means:** It can also point to a necessary item or condition needed to accomplish the verb's action.\n\nWhile のに can also express contradiction (meaning 'despite' or 'even though'), this lesson focuses exclusively on its 'in order to' meaning, which centers on purpose and the effort associated with it.",
