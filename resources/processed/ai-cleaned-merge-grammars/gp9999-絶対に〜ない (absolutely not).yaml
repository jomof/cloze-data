etymology: 「絶対」 (zettai) means “absolute” or “unconditional.” It’s originally a Buddhist term referring
  to the absolute reality, beyond distinctions. Over time, it gained the meaning of “definitely” or “by
  all means” in everyday language. When combined with a negative form (〜ない), it creates a strong, emphatic
  negation, meaning “absolutely not” or “by no means.” The adverbial particle 「に」 makes it modify the
  verb or adjective.
writeup: 「絶対に〜ない」 is a powerful and common expression in Japanese used to convey a strong, unwavering
  negation. It translates to “absolutely not,” “definitely not,” “under no circumstances,” or “by no means.”
  The core component, 「絶対に」 (zettai ni), is an adverb meaning “absolutely” or “unconditionally.” When
  paired with a negative form of a verb, い-adjective, な-adjective, or noun, it amplifies the negation
  significantly. This construction is used when the speaker wants to emphasize that something **will not**,
  **cannot**, or **must not** happen, or that something **is not** the case at all. It can express a firm
  resolution on the part of the speaker, a strong belief about an impossibility, or a categorical denial.
  For example, if you say 「絶対に食べない」 (zettai ni tabenai), it means “I absolutely will not eat (it),” implying
  a strong decision or refusal, rather than just “I don't eat.” Similarly, 「絶対に大丈夫じゃない」 (zettai ni daijoubu
  janai) means “It's absolutely not okay.” While 「絶対に」 can be used with positive statements to mean “definitely”
  or “by all means” (e.g., 「絶対に行く」 - zettai ni iku - “I will definitely go”), its combination with negation
  is a distinct and very common grammar pattern. It's important to understand the nuance of absolute certainty
  or impossibility it conveys.

  - term: 全然〜ない
    meaning: not at all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「全然〜ない」 also expresses strong negation, but it implies “not at all” or “completely not.” While
      similar to 「絶対に〜ない」 in expressing a high degree of negation, 「絶対に〜ない」 often carries a nuance of
      **impossibility or strong resolution/prohibition**, whereas 「全然〜ない」 simply states a **complete absence
      or lack**.
    grammar_point: 全然 (not at all; totally)
  - term: 決して〜ない
    meaning: never, by no means
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「決して〜ない」 is very similar to 「絶対に〜ない」 in meaning “never” or “by no means,” often implying a
      strong determination or prohibition. However, 「決して」 tends to be a bit more formal or literary than
      「絶対に」, and might carry a slightly stronger sense of moral or unwavering conviction. 「絶対に」 is more
      common in everyday spoken language for strong denial.
    grammar_point: 決して〜ない (emphatic never)
  - term: めったに〜ない
    meaning: rarely, seldom
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「めったに〜ない」 indicates that something happens infrequently or seldom, meaning “rarely does X
      happen.” This is the opposite of the absolute negation expressed by 「絶対に〜ない」, which means “X absolutely
      does not happen.”
    grammar_point: めったに〜ない (rarely)
post_false_friends_writeup: When differentiating between these similar negative expressions, consider
  the degree and type of negation. 「絶対に〜ない」 expresses an absolute and unwavering denial or impossibility.
  「全然〜ない」 signifies a complete absence or “not at all.” 「決して〜ない」 is almost interchangeable with 「絶対に〜ない」
  in meaning, but tends to be slightly more formal and often used for strong resolutions or prohibitions.
  In contrast, 「めったに〜ない」 implies infrequency, not absolute non-existence, meaning “rarely.”

  speech—verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns—as long as they are in their negative forms. The
  context often implies a strong personal conviction, a categorical statement of impossibility, or a firm
  prohibition. The register can vary, as shown, by choosing the appropriate polite or plain form for the
  predicate.
