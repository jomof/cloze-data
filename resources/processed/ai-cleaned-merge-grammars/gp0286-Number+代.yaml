    "etymology": "The kanji 代 (dai) means \"generation,\" \"age,\" or \"period.\" When used as a suffix with numbers, it refers to a specific decade of age (teens, twenties, etc.) or a chronological decade (1960s, 70s, etc.).",
    "writeup": "The suffix ～代 (dai) has several uses, most commonly to refer to someone's decade of age, such as teens, twenties, or thirties. Simply add 代 after the age (in tens). For example, 20代 (nijuu-dai) means \"twenties.\" \n\nIt can also express a chronological decade like the 1960s, 70s, or 80s. In these cases, 年代 (nendai) is often used after the decade, though it can be dropped without significantly changing the meaning.\n\n代 is also used to mark eras of time or generations of people within a specific family or political position, such as 第五代将軍 (daigo-dai shougun) \"the fifth shogun.\"",
