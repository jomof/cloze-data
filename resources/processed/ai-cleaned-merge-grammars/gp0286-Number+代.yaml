    "etymology": "The kanji 代 (dai) intrinsically carries meanings of 'generation,' 'age,' or 'period.' Its usage as a suffix to numerical expressions logically extends this core meaning. When appended to numbers representing tens (e.g., 10, 20, 30), it specifies a decade of a person's life, directly mapping to the concept of an 'age period.' When combined with 年 (nen) to form 年代 (nendai), it clearly denotes a 'year period' or chronological decade. Similarly, when paired with an ordinal number (第X代), it signifies a sequential 'generation' or 'reign' in a series, maintaining its fundamental connection to periods and successions.",
    "writeup": "The suffix ～代 (dai) is a versatile element in Japanese, primarily used to refer to decades, either of a person's age or a chronological period.\n\n**1. Decades of Age (Age Groups)**\nThis is perhaps the most common application, similar to English expressions like 'teens,' 'twenties,' or 'thirties.' To use it, simply add 代 (dai) after the age (in tens). For example:\n*   10代 (juu-dai): Teens (ages 10-19)\n*   20代 (ni-juu-dai): Twenties (ages 20-29)\n*   30代 (san-juu-dai): Thirties (ages 30-39)\nThis usage is very common in everyday conversation and surveys.\n\n**2. Chronological Decades (Historical Periods)**\n～代 can also denote a chronological decade, such as the 1960s or 1970s. In these cases, it often appears as 年代 (nendai), though sometimes 年 (nen) is omitted, especially in casual contexts or when the context is clear. For example:\n*   1980年代 (sen-kyuuhyaku-hachi-juu-nendai): The 1980s\n*   70年代 (nana-juu-nendai): The 70s\nThis is widely used when discussing historical periods, cultural trends, or past events.\n\n**3. Generations, Reigns, or Ordinal Positions**\nFurthermore, ～代 can mark specific generations, successions, or ordinal positions within a series, often appearing with an ordinal prefix like 第～代 (dai-～-dai) or alone for 'first generation' (初代 - shodai). Examples include:\n*   第5代 (dai-go-dai): The 5th generation/reign (e.g., the fifth shogun)\n*   初代 (shodai): The first generation/founder\nThis usage is common in historical, political, or organizational contexts.\n\nUnderstanding these distinct applications of ～代 is key to mastering its versatile use in Japanese.",
