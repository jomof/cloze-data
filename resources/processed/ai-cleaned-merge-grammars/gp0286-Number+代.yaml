    "etymology": "The kanji 代 (dai) intrinsically carries meanings of 'generation,' 'age,' or 'period.' Its usage as a suffix to numerical expressions logically extends this core meaning. When appended to numbers representing tens (e.g., 10, 20, 30), it specifies a decade of a person's life, directly mapping to the concept of an 'age period.' When combined with 年 (nen) to form 年代 (nendai), it clearly denotes a 'year period' or chronological decade. Similarly, when paired with an ordinal number (第X代), it signifies a sequential 'generation' or 'reign' in a series, maintaining its fundamental connection to periods and successions.",
    "writeup": "The suffix ～代 (dai) is a versatile element in Japanese, primarily used to refer to decades, either of a person's age or a chronological period.\n\n**1. Decades of Age (Age Groups)**\nThis is perhaps the most common application, similar to English expressions like 'teens,' 'twenties,' or 'thirties.' To use it, simply add 代 (dai) after the age (in tens). For example:\n*   10代 (juu-dai): Teens (ages 10-19)\n*   20代 (ni-juu-dai): Twenties (ages 20-29)\n*   30代 (san-juu-dai): Thirties (ages 30-39)\nThis usage is very common in everyday conversation and surveys.\n\n**2. Chronological Decades (Historical Periods)**\n～代 can also denote a chronological decade, such as the 1960s or 1970s. In these cases, it often appears as 年代 (nendai), though sometimes 年 (nen) is omitted, especially in casual contexts or when the context is clear. For example:\n*   1980年代 (sen-kyuuhyaku-hachi-juu-nendai): The 1980s\n*   70年代 (nana-juu-nendai): The 70s\nThis is widely used when discussing historical periods, cultural trends, or past events.\n\n**3. Generations, Reigns, or Ordinal Positions**\nFurthermore, ～代 can mark specific generations, successions, or ordinal positions within a series, often appearing with an ordinal prefix like 第～代 (dai-～-dai) or alone for 'first generation' (初代 - shodai). Examples include:\n*   第5代 (dai-go-dai): The 5th generation/reign (e.g., the fifth shogun)\n*   初代 (shodai): The first generation/founder\nThis usage is common in historical, political, or organizational contexts.\n\nUnderstanding these distinct applications of ～代 is key to mastering its versatile use in Japanese.",
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "There are no common 'false friends' that are frequently confused with the suffix '代' (dai) as its usage is quite distinct and directly tied to numerical expressions for decades, generations, or ordinal positions. Its meaning is generally unambiguous within its typical contexts.",
