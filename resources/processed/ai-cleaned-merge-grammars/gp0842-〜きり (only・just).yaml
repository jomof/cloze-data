jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Often used to express a sense of limitation, scarcity, or exclusivity. It implies that
    there is nothing more beyond what is stated.
  function: Limitation, restriction, emphasis on exclusivity.
  nuance: Stronger sense of "only" than だけ. Can sometimes carry a nuance of being alone or isolated (especially
    with 人きり - hitori kiri). Can imply a certain finality or that a situation is fixed.
etymology: The particle きり originates from 切る (kiru, to cut) and its noun form 切り (kiri, a cut or division).
  This etymological root conveys the idea of "cutting off" or "limiting" something, establishing a definitive
  boundary beyond which nothing more exists or occurs. Over time, this concept evolved to express exclusivity
  or restriction, meaning "only" or "just," as if everything else has been "cut off" or excluded. This
  explains why きり implies a strict limit or a singular occurrence.
writeup: The grammar point 〜きり is used to express that something is "only," "just," or "no more than"
  a certain amount, number, or instance. It emphasizes limitation and exclusivity, often carrying a stronger
  or more definitive nuance than だけ. When attached to a noun, it strictly limits the scope to that noun.
  For example, 「一人きり」 (hitori kiri) means "only one person," implying a sense of being alone or just a
  single entity, often with a subtle feeling of isolation or singularity. Similarly, 「これきり」 (kore kiri)
  means "only this much" or "only this one time," indicating a strict limit to the current item or occurrence.
  Unlike the more general だけ, 〜きり tends to highlight the lack of anything beyond the specified item or
  quantity. It can also imply a sense of finality, as if a boundary has been firmly established. While
  commonly used in casual and semi-formal contexts, its specific nuance can lend a slightly more decisive
  or even slightly emotional tone compared to simpler expressions of limitation. It is crucial to distinguish
  this usage from Verb[た]きり, which means "since (an action occurred, and nothing has changed)." This 〜きり
  focuses on the quantity or scope of something, rather than a temporal state.
false_friends:
  - term: だけ (only・just)
    meaning: only; just; as much as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: だけ is a general particle for "only" and can be used in a wider range of contexts without strong
      emotional nuance. 〜きり often emphasizes a small, limited, or exclusive quantity, sometimes with a
      sense of finality or even slight regret.
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: しか〜ない (only, nothing but)
    meaning: only; no more than; nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: しか〜ない also expresses exclusivity ("only"), but it must be followed by a negative verb. 〜きり
      does not require a negative verb and can be used with affirmative sentences. しか〜ない often carries
      a nuance of insufficiency or dissatisfaction, whereas 〜きり can simply state a fact of limitation.
    grammar_point: しか〜ない (only, nothing but)
  - term: ばかり (only・just, often with nuance of excess)
    meaning: only; nothing but; just; full of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ばかり can mean "only" (e.g., 「本ばかり読んでいる」 - only reading books), but it often implies "nothing
      but" or "too much of" something, or an action that is done excessively. It can also mean "just finished."
      〜きり focuses more on a strict limit of quantity or instance.
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・just, often with nuance of excess)
  - term: のみ (only・just)
    meaning: only; alone
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: のみ is a more formal and literary way of saying "only" or "alone," often used in written language
      or very formal speech. 〜きり is more common in spoken Japanese and can be more casual, carrying a
      slightly more personal or emphatic feel of limitation.
    grammar_point: のみ (only・just)
  - term: Verb[た]きり (since・no change)
    meaning: since (an action occurred, and nothing has changed)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This きり is used for actions that have occurred and a state has continued unchanged since then
      (e.g., 「彼は日本へ行ったきり、連絡がない」 - He went to Japan and hasn't contacted since). The current 〜きり emphasizes
      limitation of quantity or scope, not temporal continuity. They share the same spelling and kanji
      but have distinct functions.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[た]きり (since・no change)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 〜きり expresses a sense of "only" or "just," it is crucial to understand
  its unique flavor compared to similar expressions. Unlike the general-purpose だけ, 〜きり often implies
  a stricter, more definitive limit, sometimes carrying a subtle emotional weight like a sense of finality
  or isolation. For instance, 「一人きり」 highlights being truly alone, whereas 「一人だけ」 simply states the number.
  Similarly, しか〜ない also conveys exclusivity but *requires* a negative verb, often implying insufficiency
  or dissatisfaction. ばかり can also mean "only," but it suggests an excess or a focus on doing "nothing
  but" a particular action. Furthermore, be careful not to confuse 〜きり (quantity/limitation) with Verb[た]きり
  (since something happened and the state remains unchanged), as they are homophones with different applications.

        hint: Both phrases indicate a focus on self, but 'きり' combined with 'しか 話さない' emphasizes the strict

          focus on self.

      implying a self-centered nature or a lack of interest in others' topics. The negative verb 「話さない」
      (hanasanai) reinforces this exclusivity.
