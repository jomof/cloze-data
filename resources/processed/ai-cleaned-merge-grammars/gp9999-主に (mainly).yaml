etymology: 「主に (omoni)」is derived from the noun 「主 (omo)」, meaning "main" or "principal," combined with
  the particle 「に (ni)」. The word 「主」 originally referred to a "lord" or "master," and later evolved to
  denote the "main" or "chief" aspect of something. The addition of 「に」 functions to adverbialize 「主」,
  emphasizing the state of being "principally" or "mainly" so.
writeup: |-
  「主に (omoni)」is an adverb used to indicate that something is the main, primary, or principal element, reason, or focus. It highlights the most significant aspect, but it does not exclude the existence of other, less significant aspects. This implies a strong predominance rather than absolute exclusivity. For example, if you say a company "mainly produces cars," it suggests that while cars are their primary product, they might also produce other things in smaller quantities.

  This nuance of "predominance but not exclusivity" is crucial for understanding its proper usage. 「主に」is versatile and can modify verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses, making it a flexible tool in Japanese. It is frequently employed in descriptive contexts, reports, and explanations to emphasize the core characteristic or activity. While common in more formal or informative speech and writing, it can also appear in casual conversation.

  - term: もっぱら
    meaning: exclusively・solely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「主に」, 「もっぱら」implies exclusivity or single-mindedness. If something is 「もっぱら」a certain
      way, it means there are no other significant factors or activities.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:もっぱら (exclusively)
  - term: だけ
    meaning: only・just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だけ」acts as an absolute limiter, meaning "nothing but" or "solely." In contrast, 「主に」implies
      a main component but allows for other, less significant, elements.
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: ほとんど
    meaning: almost all・hardly any
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ほとんど」quantifies, focusing on "almost all" or "nearly none" (when used with a negative). 「主に」,
      on the other hand, indicates the *primary* aspect or focus, which might be a majority but isn't
      necessarily a precise "almost all." 「ほとんど」can express a near-zero quantity, a usage not applicable
      to 「主に」.
    grammar_point: ほとんど (almost all or hardly any)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「主に」, 「もっぱら」, 「だけ」, and 「ほとんど」, consider the degree
  of exclusivity and the type of emphasis you wish to convey. 「主に」highlights the *main* or *primary* element,
  allowing for other minor elements to exist. 「もっぱら」 signifies that an action or state is done *exclusively*
  or *solely*, leaving virtually no room for other factors or activities. 「だけ」 functions as an absolute
  limiter, conveying "only that and nothing else." 「ほとんど」 is used for quantification, meaning "almost
  all" or, when paired with a negative verb, "hardly any," focusing on the quantity or degree rather than
  the primary characteristic. Choose 「主に」when you want to indicate something is the primary thing among
  several, 「もっぱら」or 「だけ」if it's the *only* thing, and 「ほとんど」if it's *almost all* of something.
