    "etymology": "「気」 (ki) originates from the concept of energy or spirit, fundamental in Chinese and Japanese philosophy. Its use in grammar extends this idea to express feelings, intentions, or motivation related to an action.",
    "writeup": "The noun 「気」 (ki), meaning \"spirit,\" \"mind,\" or \"feeling,\" is used to express one's inclination or motivation to do something. When attached to verbs, it indicates a feeling or desire to perform that action. 「気がある」 means \"to have an interest,\" while 「気がない」 means \"to lack interest.\" 「気がする」 conveys \"to have a feeling that...\" or \"it seems like...\" and 「気がしない」 means \"to not have a feeling that...\". 「気が出る」 signifies that the feeling or desire to do something is emerging, and 「気が出ない」 means the feeling or desire isn't emerging.",
