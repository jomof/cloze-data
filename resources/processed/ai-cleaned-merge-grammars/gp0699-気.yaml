        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "General everyday usage",
        "function": "To express an internal state such as desire, will, intuition, or a subtle external aura.",
        "nuance": "気 (ki) captures a wide range of inner states, from strong motivation to a vague intuition, or even the atmosphere of a place. It differs from simple desires (e.g., ～たい) by implying a deeper, often more complex, internal or external influence."
    },
    "etymology": "The kanji 気 (ki) originally depicted 'steam' or 'vapor,' signifying something intangible yet powerful. Over time, its meaning expanded to encompass abstract concepts such as 'spirit,' 'mind,' 'energy,' and 'atmosphere.' This grammar point's usage stems from this broad conceptualization of an inner feeling or inclination, akin to 'mind' or 'spirit' in English expressions like 'to have a mind to do something.'",
    "writeup": "The noun 気 (ki) is a versatile term in Japanese, often translating to 'spirit,' 'mind,' 'feeling,' 'inclination,' or 'motivation.' When used in grammatical constructions, it typically conveys an internal state or an intangible quality. \n\nOne primary usage involves expressing a **will or desire** to perform a specific action. This is commonly seen after the plain form of a verb, such as in patterns like 「～する気がある」 (to have the motivation to do ~) or 「～する気がない」 (to not have the motivation to do ~). It highlights whether someone is positively or negatively inclined towards an action, drawing their 'mind' or 'attention' towards it.\n\nAnother significant application of 気 is to convey a **feeling or intuition** about something, often combined with auxiliary verbs like 「気がする」 (to feel like, to have a hunch). This can range from a general sense of something being true to a specific premonition. When describing an atmosphere or a subtle, intangible quality, 気 can be used with a noun, as in 「～の気」, to denote an 'aura' or 'sense' of that noun.\n\nCommon patterns illustrating these nuances include:\n*   **気がする**: To feel like, to have a hunch, to sense (e.g., 「雨が降る気がする」 - I feel like it's going to rain.)\n*   **気がしない**: To not feel like, to not have a hunch (e.g., 「成功する気がしない」 - I don't feel like I'll succeed.)\n*   **やる気**: Motivation, enthusiasm (e.g., 「やる気が出た」 - I got motivated.)\n*   **気が合う**: To get along with someone (lit. 'minds match')\n*   **気を使う**: To be considerate, to pay attention to others' feelings (lit. 'use one's mind')\n*   **気にする**: To worry about, to care about (lit. 'make it a matter of mind')\n\nThe appropriate translation of 気 depends heavily on the surrounding context and the verbs or particles it combines with. It's crucial to understand the subtle distinctions these combinations create.",
