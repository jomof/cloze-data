    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なくて」 is formed by combining the negative form of a verb or adjective 「ない」 (conjugated to 「なく」) with the conjunctive particle 「て」. This construction essentially creates a negative te-form, indicating a reason, cause, or a sequence of actions where the first action is negative.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, 「なくて」 combines the 「ない」 negative ending (conjugated to 「なく」) with the 「て」 conjunctive particle. Like the regular 「て」-form, it can connect clauses, but with a negative meaning. Often, 「なくて」 highlights the reason or cause for a specific result. It's commonly translated as \"because not (A), (B)\" or \"because I didn't (A), (B).\" Sentences using 「なくて」 often include the speaker's feelings (adjectives), potential form verbs, or situations beyond the speaker's control. This \"beyond control\" element strengthens the \"because\" translation. Words expressing things beyond one's control include 「困る」 (to be troubled), 「嬉しい」 (to be happy), 「疲れている」 (to feel weary), 「心配」 (to feel anxiety/worry), and 「安心」 (to feel relief).",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「なくて」, the regular 「～て」 form does not inherently carry a negative meaning. It simply connects actions or states, or indicates cause/reason without negation, focusing on sequence or positive condition. The contrast lies in the presence or absence of negation in the preceding clause."

It focuses more on the *manner* of an action or a co-existing negative state, rather than a direct *reason* or *cause* for a subsequent outcome, which is a key function of 「なくて」."

            "nuance": "Both 「なくて」 and 「ないから」 express a negative reason or cause. However, 「ないから」 is a more direct and explicit statement of cause, emphasizing the logical reason for the subsequent clause. 「なくて」 often implies a more natural consequence, a given state leading to an emotional outcome, or a situation beyond the speaker's control. It can also simply connect two clauses where the first is negative, without necessarily implying a strong causal link, akin to a negative 'and'."
