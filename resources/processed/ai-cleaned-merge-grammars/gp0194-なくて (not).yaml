    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なくて」 is formed by combining the negative form of a verb or adjective 「ない」 (conjugated to 「なく」) with the conjunctive particle 「て」. This construction essentially creates a negative te-form, indicating a reason, cause, or a sequence of actions where the first action is negative.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, 「なくて」 combines the 「ない」 negative ending (conjugated to 「なく」) with the 「て」 conjunctive particle. Like the regular 「て」-form, it can connect clauses, but with a negative meaning. Often, 「なくて」 highlights the reason or cause for a specific result. It's commonly translated as \"because not (A), (B)\" or \"because I didn't (A), (B).\" Sentences using 「なくて」 often include the speaker's feelings (adjectives), potential form verbs, or situations beyond the speaker's control. This \"beyond control\" element strengthens the \"because\" translation. Words expressing things beyond one's control include 「困る」 (to be troubled), 「嬉しい」 (to be happy), 「疲れている」 (to feel weary), 「心配」 (to feel anxiety/worry), and 「安心」 (to feel relief).",
