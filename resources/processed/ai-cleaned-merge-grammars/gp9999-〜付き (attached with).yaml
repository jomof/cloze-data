formation:
  Noun + 付き: Indicates that the noun has or comes with the specified feature or item.
  Verb[masu-stem] + 付き: Less common, but can describe something that comes with a specific action or way
    of being. For example, 「話し方 付き」 (with a way of speaking).
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Commonly used to describe objects, services, or people with a particular feature, condition,
    or attached item.
  function: Functions as a descriptive suffix, often forming adjectival phrases or compound nouns.
  nuance: Implies an inherent attachment, an included component, or a specific characteristic that accompanies
    the main noun. It focuses on something being 'equipped with' or 'coming with' another element as part
    of its nature or offering.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a modifier for nouns, similar to an adjective, or forms a compound noun.
etymology: The suffix 「付き」 originates from the verb 「付く」 (tsuku), meaning 'to be attached,' 'to adhere,'
  or 'to be furnished with.' When nominalized, 「付き」 describes the state or characteristic of having something
  attached or included. This evolution from a verb denoting physical attachment to a suffix signifying
  inherent features reflects its versatility in describing both tangible and intangible attributes that
  come with a subject.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「〜付き」 functions as a versatile suffix that indicates something is 'attached with,' 'comes with,' or 'includes' a particular feature or condition. It is primarily used with nouns, forming a compound noun or an adjectival phrase that modifies another noun.

  This construction is highly common in everyday Japanese, especially when describing products, services, or even the attributes of people. For instance, when purchasing an item, you might see descriptions like 「電池付き」 (with batteries included) or 「説明書付き」 (with an instruction manual).

  While often used for tangible attachments, 「〜付き」 can also describe more abstract or inherent characteristics. For example, 「笑顔付き」 (with a smile) describes someone's demeanor, or 「条件付き」 (with conditions) refers to an agreement that has stipulations.

  It provides a concise way to specify an additional component or characteristic that is part of the main subject. The nuance is generally neutral, making it suitable for both casual conversation and more formal descriptions, such as in advertising or official documents. It emphasizes the presence of the attached element as a defining or accompanying feature.

  - term: 込み
    meaning: including (all parts/charges), packed with, all-inclusive
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「込み」 often implies a more comprehensive or all-inclusive state, or something being 'packed
      in.' For instance, 「税込み」 (tax included) means the price is all-inclusive of tax. 「人込み」 (hitogomi)
      refers to a packed crowd. In contrast, 「〜付き」 describes an item having a specific feature or attachment,
      without necessarily implying 'all-inclusive.' It's more about the presence of an *additional* component.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:込み (including)
  - term: 入り
    meaning: containing, with (ingredients/contents)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜入り」 is commonly used for internal contents, especially in food and drinks (e.g., 「卵入り」 egg-containing).
      It emphasizes what is *inside*. Conversely, 「〜付き」 indicates something *attached to the outside*
      or *a feature/condition* that comes with something, not necessarily its internal composition.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:入り (containing)
  - term: 〜がある
    meaning: to have, there is
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜がある」 is a general verb for possession or existence, providing a broad statement. 「〜付き」,
      however, is a modifying suffix that integrates the 'having' concept into a single descriptive term,
      often creating a compound noun or adjectival phrase. It's more concise and focuses on a permanent,
      designed, or accompanying feature, making it part of the noun's description rather than a separate
      statement of existence.
    grammar_point: がある (possessed feature)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「〜付き」, 「込み」, and 「入り」 all convey a sense of inclusion or accompaniment,
  their specific nuances and common usages differ. 「〜付き」 emphasizes a feature or accessory that comes
  *with* something. 「込み」 often indicates that a cost or component is *already included* in a total, or
  describes a crowded state. 「入り」 typically refers to *what is contained inside* something, especially
  food or packaging. Understanding these distinctions will help you choose the most appropriate expression.

    register: formal

          are part of his 'package.' We're looking for a more ingrained description.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a new employee known for their network.

    nuance: 「驚異的な 歌唱力 付き」 emphasizes the vocal ability as a core, defining attribute that is 'attached'
      to her as a singer, highlighting it as a notable characteristic. While 「〜を持っている」 would also work,
      「〜付き」 can imply it's a natural or inherent part of her talent, especially when spoken by a female
      critic.
