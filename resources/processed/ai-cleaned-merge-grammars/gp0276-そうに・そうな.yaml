    "etymology": "The grammar point 「そう」 originates from the verb 「添う (そう)」, meaning \"to accompany\" or \"to be close to.\" Over time, it evolved to express a sense of approximation or resemblance, indicating that something 'seems' or 'looks like' something else. The 「に」 and 「な」 are grammatical particles that allow 「そう」 to function as an adverb or adjectival noun, respectively.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「そうに・そうな」 expresses that something \"seems like\" or \"looks like\" something else. It is used to convey impressions based on direct sensory information, such as visual observation or auditory perception. It implies a judgment or inference based on outward appearance.\n\n*   「そうに」 functions as an adverb, modifying verbs or adjectives. It describes the manner in which an action is performed or a state exists, based on its appearance.\n*   「そうな」 functions as an adjectival noun (な-adjective), modifying nouns. It describes a noun by its apparent state or quality.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   When using 「そう」 with negative い-adjectives (like 「ない」), you must remove the 「い」 from 「ない」 and add 「さ」 before attaching 「そう」, resulting in 「なさそう」. For example, 「おいしい」 (delicious) becomes 「おいしくなさそう」 (doesn't look delicious). This insertion of 「さ」 does **not** occur with verbs.\n*   When attached to verbs, the 「い」 from the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 is dropped, and 「そう」 is attached directly to the stem. For example, 「する」 (to do) becomes 「しなさそう」 (doesn't look like it will do), not 「しなそう」. Note that 「～なさそう」 in this context refers to the apparent unlikelihood of a verb's action.\n*   Be mindful of the context to differentiate 「そう」 meaning \"it seems\" from other uses of 「そう」, such as the 「伝聞・様態のそう」 which indicates hearsay (e.g., 「～だそうだ」 meaning \"I hear that...\") or describes the manner of an action (e.g., 「～ように」 meaning \"as if...\"). This specific 「そう」 focuses purely on direct observation and impression.",
