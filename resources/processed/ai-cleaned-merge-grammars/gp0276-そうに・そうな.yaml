    "etymology": "The grammar point 「そう」 originates from the auxiliary verb 「そうだ」, indicating a perception or appearance. When used as 「そうに」 or 「そうな」, it functions similarly to a な-adjective, describing a state or condition that something appears to be in.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「そう」, in its forms 「そうに」 and 「そうな」, conveys the meaning of \"seeming like (A)\" or \"looking like (A).\" It functions similarly to a な-adjective. This means it can be followed by 「に」 when acting as an adverb or 「な」 when acting as an adjective.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   When attaching 「そう」 to the negative form of an い-adjective (ない), you must remove the い and insert 「さ」 before 「そう」, resulting in 「なさそう」. This 「さ」 insertion does *not* occur with verbs.\n*   This grammar point is commonly used to express how something appears to the speaker based on observation.",
