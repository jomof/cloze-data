    "etymology": "The grammar point 「そう」 originates from the verb 「添う(そう)」, meaning \"to accompany\" or \"to be close to.\" Over time, it evolved to express a sense of approximation or resemblance, indicating that something 'seems' or 'looks like' something else. The 「に」 and 「な」 are grammatical particles that allow 「そう」 to function as an adverb or adjectival noun, respectively.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「そうに・そうな」 expresses that something \"seems like\" or \"looks like\" something else. It is used to convey impressions based on visual or auditory information.\n\n*   「そうに」 functions as an adverb, modifying verbs or adjectives.\n*   「そうな」 functions as an adjectival noun (な-adjective), modifying nouns. \n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   When using 「そう」 with negative い-adjectives, you must remove the 「い」 from 「ない」 and add 「さ」 before adding 「そう」, resulting in 「なさそう」. This does **not** occur with verbs.\n*   Be mindful of the context to differentiate 「そう」 meaning \"it seems\" from other uses of 「そう」, such as the 「伝聞・様態のそう」 for hearsay or description.",
