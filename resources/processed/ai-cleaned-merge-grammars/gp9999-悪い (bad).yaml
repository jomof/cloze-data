jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: adjective
  register: casual
  function: Describes negative qualities or states.
  nuance: Can refer to moral badness, poor quality, or wrongness in a situation.
etymology: The word 悪い (warui) is an い-adjective. Its origin can be traced back to earlier forms like
  吾ろしい (waroshii) and 吾し (warashi), which also carried meanings of unpleasantness or poor quality. It's
  fundamentally descriptive of a state that deviates negatively from an ideal or expected condition.
writeup: 「悪い (warui)」 is a fundamental Japanese い-adjective meaning "bad," "poor," or "wrong." It is highly
  versatile and can be used in a wide range of contexts, from describing physical conditions to moral
  judgments and situational appropriateness. **Core Meanings:** * **Quality:** It describes something
  of poor quality, e.g., 「悪い 天気」 (bad weather), 「悪い 味」 (bad taste). * **Morality/Ethics:** It can refer
  to actions or intentions that are morally wrong or undesirable, e.g., 「悪い こと」 (a bad thing/deed). *
  **Physical/Health State:** It can indicate a state of ill health or poor physical condition, e.g., 「体調
  が 悪い」 (feeling unwell). * **Situation/Circumstance:** It can describe an unfavorable or awkward situation,
  e.g., 「悪い 知らせ」 (bad news), 「悪い けど」 (sorry, but...). **Usage Notes:** * When used to describe a *person's
  nature*, it implies someone is "naughty," "wicked," or "mischievous," especially for children. For adults,
  it might imply a more serious moral failing. * It is often used in softened apologies or requests, such
  as 「悪い けど」, which is a casual way to say "Sorry, but..." or "It's bad, but could you...". This usage
  doesn't imply moral badness but rather an inconvenience or slight imposition on the listener. * Like
  all い-adjectives, it conjugates by changing the final 「い」. For example, the past tense is 「悪かった」 (was
  bad), and the negative form is 「悪くない」 (not bad). Understanding the broad applicability of 「悪い」 is crucial,
  as its specific nuance often depends heavily on the context and the noun it modifies.
false_friends:
  - term: いい (good)
    meaning: Good; nice; fine
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「いい」 is the direct opposite of 「悪い」, describing something of positive quality or favorable
      state.
    grammar_point: いい (good)
  - term: まずい (unappetizing or awkward)
    meaning: Unappetizing; tasteless; unpleasant; clumsy; awkward
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「まずい」 can mean "bad" in terms of taste, it also describes a situation as "awkward" or
      "clumsy," often less about moral wrongness and more about social discomfort or poor execution. 「悪い」
      is more general for "bad quality" or "morally wrong."
    grammar_point: まずい (unappetizing or awkward)
  - term: ひどい (terrible or harsh)
    meaning: Terrible; awful; severe; harsh; unfair
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ひどい」 conveys a stronger sense of severity, cruelty, or unfairness than 「悪い」. It implies something
      is "terrible" or "atrocious," often with an emotional impact.
    grammar_point: ひどい (terrible or harsh)
  - term: だめ (no good)
    meaning: No good; useless; hopeless; forbidden
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だめ」 often implies something is forbidden, useless, or has failed. It's less about inherent
      quality and more about functionality or rules. 「悪い」 is about inherent badness.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:だめ (no good)
  - term: いけない (must not or wrong)
    meaning: Must not; should not; wrong; bad
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いけない」 specifically refers to something being forbidden, morally wrong, or undesirable in
      a rule-based sense. While it can translate to "bad," its core is "not permissible" or "wrong to
      do." 「悪い」 is a more general descriptive term.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:いけない (must not or wrong)
  - term: すみません (apology)
    meaning: I'm sorry; excuse me
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「すみません」 is a general apology, contrasting with 「悪い けど」's specific use for "I feel bad to ask"
      or "I'm sorry to trouble you."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:すみません (apology)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「悪い」 and similar negative expressions, consider
  the *type* of "badness" being conveyed. 「悪い」 is versatile for general quality, moral standing, or an
  unfavorable state. 「まずい」 often relates to taste or awkward situations. 「ひどい」 emphasizes severity or
  cruelty. 「だめ」 implies uselessness, prohibition, or failure. 「いけない」 highlights moral wrongness or impermissibility.
  Paying attention to these subtle differences will help you choose the most appropriate word.

  for making polite requests that might cause slight inconvenience.
