jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: adjective
  register: casual
  function: Describes the quality or state of something as negative.
  nuance: Can refer to moral badness, poor quality, or unfavorable conditions.
etymology: 「悪い」 (warui) originates from the Old Japanese verb 「あし」 (ashi), meaning "to be bad, evil, ugly."
  Over time, this evolved into 「あしき」 (ashiki) and eventually 「わろし」 (waroshi) in the Heian period, which
  then became 「わるい」 (warui) in the modern language. The fundamental concept of undesirability or negativity
  has been consistent throughout its development. It is often contrasted with 「良い」 (ii/yoi), meaning "good."
writeup: 「悪い」 (warui) is a fundamental i-adjective in Japanese used to describe something as "bad," "poor,"
  "evil," or "unfavorable." Like all i-adjectives, it directly modifies nouns by preceding them (e.g.,
  悪い人 - warui hito, "bad person") and can stand alone as a predicate (e.g., それは悪い - sore wa warui, "That
  is bad"). Its core meaning encompasses a wide range of negative qualities. It can refer to moral badness,
  as in someone with a bad character (悪い人). It can describe poor quality or performance (悪い成績 - warui
  seiseki, "bad grades"). It can also express an unfavorable state or condition, such as bad weather (悪い天気
  - warui tenki) or an unfortunate situation (悪い状況 - warui joukyou). When used colloquially, especially
  among close friends or family, 「悪い」 can sometimes function similarly to "sorry" or "my bad," particularly
  in phrases like 「悪い、悪い」 (warui, warui) to acknowledge a minor mistake or inconvenience. This usage stems
  from the idea of something being "my fault" or "a bad thing" on my part. However, it is important to
  note that this is a casual and informal apology and is not suitable for formal settings where 「ごめんなさい」
  or 「すみません」 would be more appropriate. 「悪い」 can also be used ironically or sarcastically in certain contexts,
  much like "bad" in English. For example, a student might jokingly say 「悪い点数だったね」 ("It was a bad score,
  wasn't it?") to a friend who actually got a very high score, implying the opposite. Understanding the
  nuance often comes from the context of the noun it modifies or the situation in which it is used. For
  instance, 「顔色が悪い」 (kaoiro ga warui) means someone's complexion is poor, implying they look unwell, not
  that their face is morally bad.
false_friends:
  - term: だめ
    meaning: no good, useless, impossible
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だめ」 often implies something is prohibited, useless, or won't work, whereas 「悪い」 describes
      an inherent negative quality. If something is だめ, it means "it's no good, don't do it, or it failed."
      If something is 悪い, it just means "it has bad qualities."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:だめ (no good)
  - term: まずい
    meaning: bad tasting, unskillful, unfavorable/awkward
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「まずい」 primarily means "bad tasting" for food, but also "unskillful" or "awkward/unfavorable"
      for situations. While both can mean "bad," 「まずい」 focuses on sensory quality (taste) or situational
      awkwardness, whereas 「悪い」 is broader and more general.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:まずい (bad tasting)
  - term: 良くない
    meaning: not good
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「良くない」 is the direct negation of "good." While it often means the same as 「悪い」, 「悪い」 can sometimes
      carry a stronger, more inherent sense of "badness" or "evil," while 「良くない」 simply means "lacks goodness"
      or "is not up to par."
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[くない] (negative)
  - term: ひどい
    meaning: terrible, awful, cruel
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ひどい」 implies a much stronger degree of badness, often evoking feelings of cruelty, severity,
      or extreme awfulness. 「悪い」 is more general and less intense.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ひどい (terrible)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「悪い」 broadly covers "bad" or "poor," distinguishing it from similar
  expressions is key. 「だめ」 implies a state of being unacceptable, forbidden, or broken, as in 「この計画はだめだ」
  (This plan is no good/won't work). 「まずい」 often refers to bad taste or an awkward/unfavorable situation,
  like 「まずい料理」 (bad tasting food) or 「まずい状況だ」 (It's an awkward situation). 「良くない」 is simply the negative
  form of "good," meaning "not good," and can be interchangeable with 「悪い」 in many contexts but lacks
  the potential for stronger moral implications. 「ひどい」 expresses a much more extreme degree of badness,
  suggesting something terrible, cruel, or outrageous, such as 「ひどい話だ」 (a terrible story) or 「ひどい扱い」 (cruel
  treatment). Choose the most appropriate word based on the specific type and intensity of "badness" you
  wish to convey.

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「悪い」 can be applied to describe qualities, situations,
  physical conditions, and even serve as a casual apology. Note that the adverbial form 「悪く」 (waruku)
  is used when modifying verbs or other adjectives, such as 「気分が悪く」 (kibun ga waruku) meaning "feeling
  bad," or when used in the te-form to connect clauses like 「悪くてすみません」 (warukute sumimasen, "Sorry for
  being bad/troubling you").
