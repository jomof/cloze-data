    "etymology": "The particle に is believed to have originated from the verb 似る (niru), meaning \"to resemble\" or \"to be similar.\" This suggests that に originally indicated a sense of approximation or direction towards something, which evolved into its broader usage as a marker for location, time, and purpose.",
    "writeup": "に is a versatile particle in Japanese, functioning primarily as a case marker. While it translates to various English prepositions like \"in,\" \"at,\" \"to,\" \"for,\" and \"on,\" understanding its core function is key. Think of に as indicating the **endpoint** or **target** of an action or state. \n\nFor location, it specifies where something exists or where an action takes place. For direction, it shows the destination of movement. It also marks specific points in time or the recipient of an action.\n\nVerbs like 住む (sumu, \"to live\") use に instead of で because living is an action completed *at* a specific location. You're not just *in* a place; you're actively dwelling *at* that place, making it the endpoint of your action.",
