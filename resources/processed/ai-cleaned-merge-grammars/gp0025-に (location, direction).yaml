    "etymology": "The particle に has ancient roots in Old Japanese, functioning primarily as a locative and directional marker. It is believed to have evolved from a case ending indicating a fixed point, target, or destination. Over centuries, its usage expanded to encompass time, recipients, and purposes, all retaining the core idea of 'towards' or 'at' a specific point or outcome. Its fundamental role has remained remarkably consistent across the history of the language, making it one of the most foundational particles.",
    "writeup": "に is a highly versatile particle in Japanese, often posing a challenge for learners due to its many possible English translations such as \"in,\" \"at,\" \"to,\" \"for,\" or \"on.\" However, its core meaning remains consistent: に marks the **endpoint** or **destination** of an action or state. This implies that the action described can only be considered complete or capable of being completed once you reach or while you are at the specified location or time.\n\nFor instance, verbs like 住む (sumu, \"to live/dwell\") often use に, not で. This is because living is an action that is 'completed' at the destination; you can only complete the act of dwelling in the place where you live. This contrasts with で, which marks the location *where* an action takes place, implying an activity *within* a space rather than a destination or fixed point of being. Understanding this fundamental concept of an 'endpoint' or 'target' is crucial for mastering the various applications of に.\n\nWhile には generally used in standard speech, its flexibility allows it to appear across all registers, from highly formal to very casual. The choice of verb and context will determine the overall register of the sentence, rather than the particle に itself.",

            "nuance": "Unlike に, で specifies the location where an action *happens*, not the destination or fixed point of existence. For example, 公園で遊ぶ (kōen de asobu) means \"play in the park,\" indicating the action of playing occurs within the park. に emphasizes the outcome or endpoint, while で emphasizes the setting or means of an action. For example, 部屋にいる (heya ni iru, 'to be in the room') uses に because it's a fixed state of existence, whereas 部屋で勉強する (heya de benkyō suru, 'to study in the room') uses で because studying is an action performed within the room."

            "nuance": "Unlike に, にて is a more formal expression often used in written language, formal announcements, or traditional contexts to indicate location, means, or method. For example, 会議室にて (kaigishitsu nite) means \"in the conference room,\" but is more formal than 会議室に. It often implies a designated venue or method."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference between に and で lies in their function. に indicates a fixed point, a destination, a recipient, or a specific time, essentially marking the *endpoint* or *target* of an action or state. Conversely, で specifies the place where an action *occurs* or the means by which an action is performed. にて, on the other hand, is a more formal alternative to に, often used in official contexts or writing. Pay close attention to the nature of the verb—whether it implies a state, movement towards a destination, or an action taking place *within* a location—to choose the correct particle.",
