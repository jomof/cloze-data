    "etymology": "The particle に has ancient roots in Old Japanese, functioning primarily as a locative and directional marker. It is believed to have evolved from a case ending indicating a fixed point, target, or destination. Over centuries, its usage expanded to encompass time, recipients, and purposes, all retaining the core idea of 'towards' or 'at' a specific point or outcome.",
    "writeup": "に is a highly versatile particle in Japanese, often posing a challenge due to its many English translations such as \"in,\" \"at,\" \"to,\" \"for,\" or \"on.\" However, its core meaning remains consistent: に marks the **endpoint** or **destination** of an action or state. This implies that the action described can only be considered complete or capable of being completed once you reach or while you are at the specified location or time.\n\nFor instance, verbs like 住む (sumu, \"to live/dwell\") often use に, not で. This is because living is an action that is 'completed' at the destination; you can only complete the act of dwelling in the place where you live. This contrasts with で, which marks the location *where* an action takes place, implying an activity *within* a space rather than a destination or fixed point of being. Understanding this fundamental concept of an 'endpoint' or 'target' is crucial for mastering the various applications of に.",
