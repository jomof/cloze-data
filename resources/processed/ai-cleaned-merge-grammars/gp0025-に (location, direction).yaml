    "etymology": "The particle に originates from the verb 似る (niru), meaning \"to resemble\" or \"to be similar to.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate the target or direction of an action, implying a sense of approaching or becoming similar to a specific point or location.",
    "writeup": "に is a versatile particle in Japanese, primarily used to indicate a location, direction, time, or purpose. Think of it as pinpointing where or when something exists or is headed. It can be tricky because its English translations vary widely, including \"in,\" \"at,\" \"to,\" \"for,\" and \"on.\" Instead of memorizing a bunch of different meanings, try to grasp the core concept: に often marks the **endpoint** or **destination** of an action or state. For example, when used with verbs like 住む (sumu, \"to live\"), it shows the place where the action of living is directed and completed. Note the distinction between に and で which marks the location **where** an action happens. に specifies the **destination or purpose** related to the verb.",

While 「へ」 also indicates direction, 「に」 emphasizes the *arrival at* or *fixation on* the destination, aligning with the core meaning of 「に」 as an endpoint.
