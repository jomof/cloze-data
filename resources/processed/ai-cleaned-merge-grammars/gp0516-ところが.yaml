        "usage-context": "Used to introduce an unexpected or contradictory outcome.",
        "function": "To indicate a surprising turn of events or an outcome that defies expectation.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes that the following statement is contrary to what was expected or implied by the preceding statement. It often implies that the unexpected outcome is beyond the speaker's control. It can also be used when the speaker is trying to do something, but assumes that their attempt may result in failure, and then unexpectedly succeeds.",
        "grammatical-role": "Connects clauses or sentences, serving as a transitional word.",
        "logical-flow": "Presents a contrast where the second clause is an unexpected consequence of the first."
    },
    "etymology": "The conjunction 「ところが」 is formed from the noun 「ところ」 (tokoro), meaning 'place' or 'point/aspect', and the conjunctive particle 「が」 (ga), which introduces a contrast. Historically, the combination evolved to express a 'point' or 'situation' where something unexpected occurs, leading to its current meaning of 'however' or 'unexpectedly'. It is a fixed expression that has lost its original literal meaning of 'at that place' in this context.",
    "writeup": "「ところが」 is a conjunction used to introduce an unexpected outcome or a surprising turn of events that directly contrasts with what was previously stated or implied. It functions much like \"however,\" \"even so,\" or \"but\" in English, but with a strong emphasis on the element of surprise or contradiction.\n\nThis grammar point is typically placed at the beginning of the second clause or sentence, setting up a clear contrast between the initial situation or expectation and the subsequent, surprising reality. The unexpected outcome introduced by 「ところが」 is often something beyond the speaker's control.\n\nFor example, if you say, 「今日は晴れるはずだった。**{ところが}**、雨が降ってきた。」 (It was supposed to be sunny today. However, it started raining.), you are highlighting the unexpectedness of the rain despite the forecast. Similarly, if a speaker attempts something they expect to fail, 「ところが」 can highlight an unexpected success: 「難しい試験だった。**{ところが}**、合格した。」 (It was a difficult exam. However, I passed).\n\nThis use of 「が」 is sometimes referred to as 確定の逆接 (kakutei no gyakusetsu), meaning a 'definite or established contradiction,' signifying that the contradictory information is presented as a confirmed fact.",

            "meaning": "But, However",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "While 「が」 can introduce a simple contrast, 「ところが」 specifically emphasizes that the subsequent event is unexpected or surprising relative to the preceding one. 「が」 does not necessarily carry this nuance of unexpectedness."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「却って」 implies that an action or situation has an opposite or intensified (often negative) effect than intended or expected. In contrast, 「ところが」 simply introduces a surprising, contradictory outcome that occurred, not necessarily a reversal of an intended effect."

            "nuance": "「それにしても」 is used to comment on a surprising aspect or to emphasize a point despite previous information. It introduces a remark or re-evaluation rather than a direct, unexpected event that contradicts a prior statement, which is the core function of 「ところが」."

            "nuance": "「だが」 (or its polite form 「ですが」) is a general conjunction for contrast, indicating a simple opposition between two statements. 「ところが」, however, specifically conveys a sense of surprise or unexpectedness regarding the contrasting event, making the outcome stand out more dramatically."

            "nuance": "「それでも」 implies that a certain state or action persists or remains true despite a preceding condition or obstacle. It suggests endurance or determination. 「ところが」, by contrast, introduces a sudden, surprising contradiction or a definitive change that defies expectations."

            "nuance": "「けれども」 introduces a contrast or qualification, often in a milder tone than 「しかし」. While it connects opposing ideas, it does not inherently carry the strong nuance of surprise or the unexpectedness that is central to the meaning of 「ところが」."

            "nuance": "「けど」 (and its slightly more assertive variant 「だけど」) are informal ways to express contrast or concession. They are general-purpose conjunctions. 「ところが」, while also indicating contrast, specifically highlights an unexpected or surprising situation, making it more emphatic regarding the outcome."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these expressions share some semantic overlap with 「ところが」 in indicating contrast, 「ところが」 stands out by its explicit emphasis on an unexpected outcome or a surprising turn of events.
