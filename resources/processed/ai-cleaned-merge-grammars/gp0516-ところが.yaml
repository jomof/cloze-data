    "etymology": "ところが is derived from the noun 「所 (tokoro)」, meaning 'place' or 'point', combined with the conjunction particle 「が (ga)」. It originally indicated a shift in location or point of view, but evolved to signify a shift in circumstances or expectations.",
    "writeup": "「ところが」 is a conjunction in Japanese that combines the noun 「所 (tokoro)」, meaning \"place,\" and the conjunction particle 「が (ga)。」 It highlights that (A) was expected, but the unexpected result (B) occurred. It translates to \"however,\" \"even so,\" or \"despite that.\" 「ところが」 often appears at the beginning of a new sentence, introducing something contrary to what was previously described.\n\nThe 「が」 in this usage is called 「確定の逆接 (kakutei no gyakusetsu)」, indicating a contradictory conclusion.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\n「ところが」 emphasizes an unexpected result, applicable only to situations beyond the speaker's control. However, if the speaker anticipates potential failure in their attempt but unexpectedly succeeds, 「ところが」 can express this surprise.",
