    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from combining 「に」, indicating a target or purpose, and 「決まっている」, the te-iru form of the verb 「決まる」(kimaru), meaning \"to be decided.\" So, literally, it suggests that something is decisively determined.",
    "writeup": "「に決まっている」 (ni kimatteiru) expresses a **strong conviction** or belief that something is certainly the case. It's used when the speaker is highly confident, even without absolute proof. It translates to \"surely,\" \"bound to be,\" or \"certainly.\" The nuance is that the speaker feels something is a given, based on their understanding or assumptions. It is commonly used in everyday conversation to express opinions with confidence.",
