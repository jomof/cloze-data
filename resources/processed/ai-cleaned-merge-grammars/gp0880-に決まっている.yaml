    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from combining 「に」, indicating a target or purpose, and 「決まっている」, the te-iru form of the verb 「決まる」(kimaru), meaning \"to be decided.\" So, literally, it suggests that something is decisively determined.",
    "writeup": "「に決まっている」 (ni kimatteiru) expresses a **strong conviction** or belief that something is certainly the case. It's used when the speaker is highly confident, even without absolute proof. It translates to \"surely,\" \"bound to be,\" or \"certainly.\" The nuance is that the speaker feels something is a given, based on their understanding or assumptions. It is commonly used in everyday conversation to express opinions with confidence.",

            "etymology": "「選手」(senshu) means athlete,「足」(ashi) means leg/foot, and 「速い」(hayai) means fast.",
            "nuance": "The conjunction 「から」 indicates causation, highlighting why the speaker is confident in their assertion. The use of 「に決まっている」 reinforces the speaker's strong belief and confidence in the outcome.",

            "nuance": "The strong combination of 「こんなに頑張ったんだから」 (because I worked this hard), 「絶対」 (absolutely), and the casual 「に決まってる」 followed by 「じゃない」 (a rhetorical question implying shared understanding) creates an excited and passionate declaration of certainty, especially common in moments of self-motivation or encouragement.",

B: ...), rewrite them into single-sentence statements that preserve the lesson but remove direct dialogue format.'",
        "violation: Nuance fields: Updated all `nuance` fields to use `「quotes」` around Japanese phrases. Reason: Rule 6 states 'Nuance must refer to parts of the japanese sentence in 「quotes」.'",

Reason: Rule 0 states 'Only list conjugations that, when used, preserve the meaning of the grammar point.' Explicitly negated forms of the grammar point itself do not naturally convey the intended meaning of strong conviction; instead, negation typically applies to the preceding clause.",
