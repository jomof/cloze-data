    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に決まっている」 comes from 「決まる (kimaru)」 which means 'to be decided' or 'to be settled.' The 「に」 particle indicates the reason or cause, so literally it means 'because it's decided.' This evolved into expressing a strong certainty or conviction.",
    "writeup": "「に決まっている」 is a strong expression indicating the speaker's firm belief that something is definitely true or will certainly happen, even without concrete proof. It conveys a sense of obviousness or inevitability. It's often translated as \"surely,\" \"bound to,\" \"certainly,\" or \"must be.\" Because this structure combines 「に」 with the 「ている」 form of the verb 「決まる」 ('to decide'), a literal translation would be something like \"for (A) to be decisively the case.\" This grammar point emphasizes the speaker's subjective opinion, influenced by their prior assumptions and thoughts.",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "This sentence suggests the speaker is making a casual observation based on a known fact (the athlete's speed). The use of 「から」 indicates a clear cause-and-effect relationship.",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "serious",
            "nuance": "「決まってる」 is the shortened casual form of 「決まっている」.  The speaker conveys their subjective certainty about a natural fear. The level of 「怖いに」 is fairly blunt and direct. Even when talking to older or younger people, avoid phrasing your opinion in a blunt or arrogant way.",
            "etymology": "The use of 「に決まってる」 emphasizes the speaker's unwavering belief that this is a natural and obvious sentiment."
