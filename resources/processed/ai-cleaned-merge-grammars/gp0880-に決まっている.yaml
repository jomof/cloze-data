        "function": "Expresses the speaker's strong conviction or certainty about a statement's truth, often based on common sense or strong belief rather than absolute proof.",
        "nuance": "This phrase conveys a high degree of subjective certainty. The speaker is asserting that something is undeniably true, often implying it's an obvious conclusion that others should also reach.

    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from combining 「に」 (ni), indicating a target or state, and 「決まっている」 (kimatteiru), the te-iru form of the verb 「決まる」 (kimaru), meaning \"to be decided.\" So, literally, it suggests that something is decisively determined to be in a certain state or condition.",
    "writeup": "「に決まっている」 (ni kimatteiru) expresses a **strong conviction** or belief that something is certainly the case. It's used when the speaker is highly confident, even without absolute proof. It translates to \"surely,\" \"bound to be,\" or \"certainly.\" The nuance is that the speaker feels something is a given, based on their understanding or assumptions. It is commonly used in everyday conversation to express opinions with confidence.\n\nThis expression primarily focuses on the speaker's subjective opinion about the statement. It takes into consideration their own preformed opinions or thoughts, regardless of what the actual facts may be. This means the certainty conveyed is personal rather than objective.\n\nWhile typically used in standard and casual registers, the polite form 「に決まっています」 (ni kimatteimasu) can also be used in more formal contexts when asserting a strong, undeniable truth.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「にする」 relates to making a deliberate choice and 「ことになる」 indicates a formal decision or outcome, 「に決まっている」 conveys the speaker's strong subjective conviction or belief. 「に違いない」 is similar in conveying certainty, but is generally based on deduction from evidence, whereas 「に決まっている」 relies more on personal assumptions and subjective feelings.
