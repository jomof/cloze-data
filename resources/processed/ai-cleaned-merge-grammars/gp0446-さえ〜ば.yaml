    "etymology": "The grammar point 「さえ〜ば」 is a combination of the particle 「さえ」 (even, if only) and the conditional 「ば」 form. 「さえ」 emphasizes the minimum requirement, while 「ば」 indicates a conditional relationship. Together, they create the meaning of 'if only... then'.",
    "writeup": "「さえ〜ば」 is a set expression combining the adverbial particle 「さえ」 and the conjunction particle 「ば」. It highlights a necessary condition. (A) is presented as the bare minimum needed to achieve (B). This can be translated as \"if only (A), then (B),\" \"the only thing needed for (A) is (B),\" or \"as long as (A), (B).\" 「さえ」 can follow a noun directly or be attached to the conjunctive (te-form) of a verb. It often follows other particles, creating dual-particle meanings. This usage of 「さえ」 indicates a limit, with (A) being a hypothetical limit set by the 「ば」 particle. While 「さえ」 can appear with other hypothetical markers like 「たら」, 「さえ〜ば」 is the standard, established pattern. The limitation can also be seen as a 'stipulation' or 'condition'.",
