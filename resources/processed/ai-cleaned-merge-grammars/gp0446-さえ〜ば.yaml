    "etymology": "The grammar point 「さえ〜ば」 is a combination of 「さえ」, an adverbial particle indicating 'even' or 'only,' and 「ば」, a conjunction particle indicating a hypothetical condition. The particle 「さえ」 emphasizes the minimum requirement needed for a certain result, while 「ば」 sets up the conditional clause.",
    "writeup": "The 「さえ〜ば」 construction expresses a condition where if only a certain requirement is met, then a specific result will occur. It emphasizes that meeting this condition is both necessary and sufficient for the outcome. It can be translated as \"if only (A), then (B),\" \"as long as (A), (B),\" or \"provided that (A), (B).\" 「さえ」 can follow a noun directly or be attached to the verb's 「て」 form. This grammar is frequently used to express a sense of wishing or hoping for a particular condition to be fulfilled.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene of a \"doctor advising\" implies a strong, sufficient condition. The 「さえ」 emphasizes that this one action is *all that is needed*. Without 「さえ」, it's just a general condition."
