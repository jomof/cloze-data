    "etymology": "The grammar point 「さえ〜ば」 is a combination of 「さえ」, an adverbial particle indicating 'even' or 'only,' and 「ば」, a conjunction particle indicating a hypothetical condition. The particle 「さえ」 emphasizes the minimum requirement needed for a certain result, while 「ば」 sets up the conditional clause.",
    "writeup": "As a set expression, **さえ〜ば** is a combination of the adverbial particle **さえ**, and the conjunction particle **ば**. It is used to highlight an assumption, and presents (A) as an extreme limitation that is required to achieve (B), hypothetically. This structure may be translated as 'if only (A), then (B)', 'the only thing needed for (A) is (B)', or 'as long as (A), (B)'. **さえ** may be grouped with any word, but will require the conjunctive form, or te-form before it when grouped with verbs. It also regularly appears after other particles, forming a dual-particle meaning. This use of **さえ** is an example of a limit, with (A) being a hypothetical limit presented by the **ば** particle. It is also possible to see **さえ** with other hypothetical indicators (such as たら), but is quite rare in modern Japanese, as **さえ〜ば** is considered a set pattern. This limitation is also sometimes referred to as a 'stipulation' or 'condition'.",
