    "etymology": "The particle 「から」 has its roots in classical Japanese. Its basic function is to indicate a starting point, whether in time, location, or origin. Over time, its usage has expanded to include other nuances like 'because' and 'since,' but the core meaning of 'from' remains fundamental.",
    "writeup": "「から」 is a versatile particle in Japanese, most commonly translated as \"from.\" It indicates a starting point, whether it's a location, a time, or even the source of something. The placement of 「から」 directly after the noun signifies that the noun is the origin or beginning point. This usage aligns with the particle's core meaning of \"from\" in Japanese.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   When used after nouns or な-adjectives indicating \"from\", the particle 「だ」 is unnecessary and would change the meaning to \"because\".",
