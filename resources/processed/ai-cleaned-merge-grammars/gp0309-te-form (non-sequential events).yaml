  usage-context: general use
etymology: The particle 「て」 originally derives from the conjunctive particle 「而 (して)」 in classical Japanese,
  which was used to connect clauses. Over time, it evolved into the 「て」-form, serving various functions,
  including connecting clauses in a non-sequential manner, indicating reasons, or providing a sequence
  of actions.
writeup: The 「て」-form of a verb, adjective, or noun can connect two independent clauses, indicating a
  variety of relationships between the actions or states described. These relationships can be non-sequential
  events, contrasts (similar to the contrastive use of 「は」), or parallel actions/states. It's crucial
  to consider whether the events happen one after the other or if they simply describe "(A), and (B)".
  Sometimes, this usage of 「て」 is translated as "while (A), also (B)." The key difference between this
  and other "while" or "but" grammar points (like 「けど」, 「のに」, or 「だが」) is that both (A) and (B) have equal
  weight and importance. These other grammar points usually imply that either (A) or (B) is more important.
false_friends:
  - term: てもいい
    meaning: May; allowed to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike Verb[て] used for non-sequential events, 「てもいい」 expresses permission to do something.
      It uses the て-form but attaches a different meaning through the addition of 「もいい」.
    grammar_point: Verb[て]+もいい (permission)
  - term: てから
    meaning: After doing something
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike Verb[て] in this context, 「てから」 explicitly indicates a sequential action where A happens,
      and then B happens. This grammar point specifically highlights non-sequential or simultaneous relationships.
    grammar_point: てから (after and since)
  - term: そして
    meaning: And; then; and then
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そして」 primarily indicates a sequence of events or adds another item to a list, often with
      a stronger emphasis on the transition. The 「て」 form, in contrast, can connect actions/states that
      are concurrent, parallel, or simply presented as facts without a strong sequential implication.
    grammar_point: そして (and・and then)
  - term: けど
    meaning: But; although
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「けど」 emphasizes a contradiction or concession. While 「て」 can show contrast, it typically presents
      two facts with equal weight, without necessarily highlighting a strong contradiction.
    grammar_point: けど・だけど (but・however)
  - term: それに
    meaning: In addition; moreover
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「それに」 adds further information or another item to a list, similar to 'and' or 'moreover' in
      English. The 「て」 form can also connect additional information, but 「それに」 tends to emphasize the
      additive nature more explicitly, often introducing a separate, reinforcing point.
    grammar_point: それに (in addition)
  - term: それから
    meaning: And then; after that; since then
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「それから」 clearly marks a temporal sequence of events or a transition to the next topic. The
      「て」 form, while sometimes indicating sequence, is broader and can connect non-sequential, parallel,
      or descriptive clauses. 「それから」 places a stronger emphasis on the passage of time or the order of
      listing.
    grammar_point: それから (and then・after that)
  - term: 一方
    meaning: On the other hand; meanwhile
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「一方」 (いっぽう) is a more formal expression used to introduce a contrasting or parallel situation,
      often when comparing two distinct subjects or aspects. The 「て」 form offers a more natural and less
      formal way to simply state two concurrent or contrasting facts without explicitly drawing a comparison.
    grammar_point: 一方 (on the one hand)
  - term: Verb[て] (sequential action)
    meaning: And, and then, after that (sequence)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While this 「て」 form emphasizes non-sequential or parallel events, Verb[て] (sequential action)
      specifically denotes a strict chronological sequence of actions where one action definitively follows
      another.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て] (sequential action)
  - term: Verbて (uncontrollable consequence)
    meaning: Because of, due to, since; expresses a cause-and-effect relationship where the cause is often
      beyond the speaker's control.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike this 「て」 form which simply connects events or states, Verbて (uncontrollable consequence)
      explicitly expresses a cause-and-effect relationship, often for an undesirable or uncontrollable
      outcome.
    grammar_point: Verbて (uncontrollable consequence)
  - term: ながら (while doing)
    meaning: While ~ing, During, As
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While this 「て」 form can describe parallel actions, 「ながら」 specifically emphasizes two actions
      happening simultaneously, with one action often being secondary or background to the main action.
      The 「て」 form for parallel events often describes two independent actions or states without a main/secondary
      relationship.
    grammar_point: ながら (while doing)
  - term: し〜し (and; listing reasons)
    meaning: And, Giving reasons
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 「て」 and 「し〜し」 can list multiple characteristics or reasons. However, 「し〜し」 often implies
      that the listed items are reasons or contributing factors, and it can also have a more emphatic
      or exhaustive nuance, sometimes implying 'not only A but also B and C'.
    grammar_point: し〜し (and; listing reasons)
post_false_friends_writeup: It's important to distinguish this non-sequential 「て」 from other uses of the
  「て」-form and similar conjunctions. For instance, while this 「て」 describes concurrent or contrasting
  situations without a strict order, 「Verb[て] (sequential action)」 strictly implies a sequence. 「Verbて
  (uncontrollable consequence)」 focuses on cause and effect. Other conjunctions like 「てから」, 「そして」, 「それから」,
  and 「一方」 also connect clauses, but each carries specific nuances of sequence, contrast, or addition
  that differ from the more balanced, non-sequential nature of this 「て」 form. 「ながら」 and 「し〜し」 can also
  indicate parallel actions or lists, but they often carry additional nuances of emphasis or secondary
  actions. Paying close attention to the context and the precise relationship between clauses will help
  you choose the appropriate expression.
