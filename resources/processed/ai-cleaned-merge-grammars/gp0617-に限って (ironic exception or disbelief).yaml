  usage-context: Used in situations where the speaker expresses surprise, disbelief, or frustration regarding
    an unexpected or ironic occurrence, or to highlight a specific characteristic or tendency of a person/group,
    often implying a negative outcome or an exception to a general rule.
  function: To indicate a specific exception, an unexpected event, or an ironic coincidence. It can also
    imply a general tendency, often a negative one, about a particular group.
  nuance: Implies a sense of unlikelihood, irony, or a surprising deviation from the norm concerning the
    noun it modifies. When used with people, it can express strong trust ('My child, of all people, wouldn't
    do that!') or a cynical observation ('Those who always talk about X, always do Y').
  counterpoint: Differs from simple expressions like 'だけ' (only) or '～の時だけ' (only when) by adding a strong
    nuance of unexpectedness, irony, or disbelief. It often implies a negative or inconvenient outcome.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a compound particle that singles out the preceding noun as the specific
    condition or entity under discussion, emphasizing its unique role in the stated situation.
  logical-flow: Presents the preceding noun as a unique or exceptional condition/subject, followed by
    a consequence that is often surprising, ironic, or contrary to expectation.
  temporal-flow: When modifying time-related nouns, it highlights specific ironic timing.
  spatial-flow: Not applicable; primarily used for temporal, personal, or conditional exceptions.
etymology: The grammar point 「に限って」 is formed from 「に」 (a particle indicating a specific condition or
  scope, similar to "at" or "in") and 「限って」, which is the te-form of the verb 「限る」 (kagiru), meaning "to
  limit" or "restrict." Thus, 「に限って」 literally means "limited to" or "only in the case of." Over time,
  its usage expanded to convey a sense of exception, emphasis on a particular instance, or ironic timing.
writeup: |-
  The expression 「に限って」 in Japanese has several key uses. Primarily, it indicates a limitation or exception, often implying disbelief or unexpectedness. Depending on the context, it can mean "only when," "especially when," "particularly when," or refer to "those who" or "the only ones who" exhibit a certain trait or experience.

  It often carries a nuance of surprise or disbelief that something is true about a specific person, thing, or situation. When used with people, it can express strong trust in someone, implying, "It couldn't possibly be *that person*." Conversely, it can also be used cynically to point out a common, often negative, tendency of a group, suggesting, "*Those* kinds of people always do X."

  Be careful about using it though, since sometimes it can imply an unnecessary or rude level of judgement, especially when expressing a cynical observation about a group.
false_friends:
  - term: だけ
    meaning: Only; just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だけ」 is a simple limiter indicating exclusivity without the nuance of surprise, irony, or
      disbelief that 「に限って」 carries. It's a neutral statement of limitation, whereas 「に限って」 often implies
      an unexpected or undesirable exception. For example, 「コーヒーだけ飲む」 (I only drink coffee) is a neutral
      statement, but 「急いでいる時に限って雨が降る」 (It only rains when I'm in a hurry) implies an ironic misfortune
      that 「急いでいる時だけ雨が降る」 might not fully capture, though it is sometimes used interchangeably in casual
      speech, thereby causing confusion with the uninitiated learner.
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: ばかりに
    meaning: simply because; only because
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ばかりに」 emphasizes that a negative outcome is directly caused *only* by a specific preceding
      action or condition, often implying regret or blame. Unlike 「に限って」, which focuses on ironic timing
      or a surprising exception, 「ばかりに」 directly attributes the consequence to the preceding cause.
    grammar_point: ばかりに (simply because)
  - term: ときたら
    meaning: when it comes to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ときたら」 introduces a topic (often a person or group) about which the speaker has a negative
      or exasperated opinion. While 「に限って」 can also express a cynical observation about a group, 「ときたら」
      is purely about the speaker's negative judgment or complaint. 「に限って」 also covers ironic timing,
      which 「ときたら」 does not.
    grammar_point: ときたら・と来たら (when it comes to)
  - term: だけに
    meaning: as expected
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だけに」 indicates that something is *as expected* or *naturally so* given a certain condition
      or quality, often with a positive or neutral connotation. This contrasts sharply with 「に限って」, which
      often implies an unexpected, ironic, or inconvenient outcome.
    grammar_point: 〜だけあって・〜だけに・〜だけのことはある (as expected・precisely because)
  - term: 時ばかり
    meaning: just when; only when (ironic timing)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「時ばかり」 is used to describe an event that happens precisely and inconveniently at a specific
      time, much like the ironic timing use of 「に限って」. However, 「に限って」 carries a stronger sense of irony
      or frustration, and also has the additional meaning of disbelief about a person or group.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:時ばかり (just when)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「だけ」 simply indicates exclusivity, 「に限って」 adds a layer of irony, surprise,
  or disbelief to the situation. It suggests that something happens *particularly* or *ironically* only
  in a specific instance, often contrary to expectation or desire. For example, while 「雨が降っている時だけ傘をさす」
  (I only use an umbrella when it's raining) is a neutral statement, 「大事な日に限って雨が降る」 (It only rains on
  important days, ironically) expresses frustration or bad luck. Therefore, when you want to convey that
  something is an unfortunate exception or an ironic coincidence, 「に限って」 is the more appropriate choice.
  「ばかりに」, 「ときたら」, and 「だけに」 share some structural similarities but diverge significantly in nuance. 「ばかりに」
  assigns a negative consequence *due to* a specific cause. 「ときたら」 expresses exasperation *about* a certain
  person or type of situation. Conversely, 「だけに」 implies an outcome is *natural and expected* given a
  preceding condition. Understanding these distinctions is key to using 「に限って」 accurately for its unique
  emotional and ironic emphasis.

        english: I can't believe my quiet dog would bark at the mailman.
        hint: Using が simply states a fact about the dog. 「に限って」 adds a strong nuance of disbelief or
          irony, emphasizing that this specific dog, of all dogs, is doing something unexpected. We're
          looking for that stronger emphasis on the specific individual.

          or irony. We're looking for that stronger emphasis on the specific individual.
    scene: An employee observes their typically on-time boss arriving late for the first time.

        english: It always happens that only when I'm in a hurry, I get a flat tire.
        hint: 「だけ」 is a neutral way to say 'only' or 'just'. 「に限って」 adds a nuance of irony or unfortunate
          coincidence, implying that something bad happens specifically at that inconvenient time. We're
          looking for that sense of ironic timing.

        english: If it were my son, he wouldn't do such a thing.
