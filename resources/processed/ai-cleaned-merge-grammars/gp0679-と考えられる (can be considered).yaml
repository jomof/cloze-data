    "etymology": "「考えられる」 is composed of the verb 「考える」(kangaeru, to think), the potential form 「考えられる」(kangaerareru, can think, be thinkable), and the particle 「と」(to, that). Thus, literally it means \"that it can be thought.\"",
    "writeup": "「と考えられる」 is used to express an objective opinion or possibility. It combines 「と」 (to), indicating a quote or content, with the passive-potential form 「考えられる」 (kangaerareru), meaning \"can be thought\" or \"is conceivable\". The structure translates to \"can be considered as (A),\" \"is thought to be (A),\" or \"it is conceivable that (A)\". Because it begins with 「と」, it's often used at the end of phrases, turning them into a quotation.\n\nIt's crucial to distinguish this from 「と思われる」 (omowareru), which expresses a **subjective** opinion. An objective opinion relies on observable facts, whereas a subjective opinion is based on feelings or preferences.\n\nCompared to 「と考えられている」(to kangaerareteiru), 「と考えられる」 focuses more on judgments rather than widely accepted opinions. Use 「と考えられている」 to express accepted, mainstream knowledge, while 「と考えられる」 is more useful when rendering a specific judgment. This expression is generally used in formal or academic contexts when presenting objective assessments.",
