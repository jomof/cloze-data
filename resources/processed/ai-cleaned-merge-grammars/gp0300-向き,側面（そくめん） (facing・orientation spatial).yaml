        "usage-context": "Used to describe physical orientation, suitability, or abstract aspects/facets. '向き' often implies a specific direction or a target audience/purpose. '側面' denotes a 'side' in a physical sense or a 'facet/aspect' in an abstract sense.",
        "function": "To specify direction, suitability, or an abstract/physical side.",

        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a noun or a suffix modifying another noun."
    },
    "etymology": "「向き」(muki) derives from 「向く」(muku), a verb meaning 'to face' or 'to turn towards.' Over time, it developed noun forms to indicate 'direction' or 'suitability/inclination.' For instance, something is 'facing' a certain way, or 'turned towards' a specific purpose or audience. 「側面」(sokumen) is a compound word: 「側」(soku), meaning 'side,' and 「面」(men), meaning 'face' or 'surface.' Thus, it literally means 'side-surface,' referring to a lateral aspect, both physically and metaphorically.",
    "writeup": "「向き」(muki) and 「側面」(sokumen) are two distinct nouns that both relate to orientation and aspects, but with different nuances and applications. Understanding their specific uses is key to expressing precise spatial and conceptual relationships in Japanese. 「向き」 primarily functions in two ways: 1. **Direction/Facing**: It indicates the direction something is physically facing or oriented towards. For example, when describing a house, you might say it's 南向き (minami muki - south-facing). This specifies its orientation relative to a cardinal direction. 2. **Suitability/Intended For**: When appended to a noun, 「向き」 can indicate that something is suitable for, intended for, or designed for a particular group or purpose. For example, 子供向き (kodomo muki - suitable for children) implies that an item or activity is appropriate or designed with children in mind. This usage highlights an intended audience or purpose. 「側面」 also has two main uses, often distinguished by context: 1. **Physical Side**: It refers to the physical side of an object or building. Think of the 'side' of a box, a car, or a wall. For instance, ビルの側面 (biru no sokumen - the side of the building) would refer to one of its exterior walls. 2. **Abstract Aspect/Facet**: More broadly, 「側面」 can refer to an abstract 'side' or 'aspect' of a situation, problem, or personality. When discussing complex issues, one might talk about 経済的な側面 (keizai-teki na sokumen - economic aspect) or 精神的な側面 (seishin-teki na sokumen - psychological aspect). This usage is very common in formal or academic discussions, allowing for a nuanced exploration of different facets of a topic. **Key Distinctions:** * 「向き」 is about orientation or *direction* (where something is pointing or intended for), whereas 「側面」 is about a *physical or abstract boundary/face*. * While 「向き」 can suggest a 'fit' or 'suitability,' 「側面」 always implies a 'part' or 'viewpoint' of a whole. Using these terms correctly allows for greater clarity in both concrete spatial descriptions and abstract conceptual discussions.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「方向」 and 「方」 both mean 'direction,' they are more general. 「方向」 is like a path or general bearing (e.g., 'which direction should we go?'), whereas 「向き」 refers to the precise way something is facing (e.g., 'the house faces south'). 「方」 can also mean 'direction' but is more often used for a specific person or a method. Similarly, 「側」 is a broader term for 'side,' while 「側面」 emphasizes a specific 'face' or 'aspect,' making it suitable for discussing specific facets of a situation or object. 「向け」 is often used for things actively 'directed towards' someone, while 「向き」 implies inherent 'suitability'. Lastly, 「～用」 indicates something is 'for use by' a group, and 「～専用」 implies 'exclusive use', both being more specific designations than the general 'suitability' of 「向き」.",
