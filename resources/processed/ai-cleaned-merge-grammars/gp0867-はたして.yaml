            "etymology": "The word 「計画 (keikaku)」 means 'plan' or 'project'. It combines 「計 (kei)」, referring to 'to measure' or 'to plan', and 「画 (kaku)」, referring to 'a drawing' or 'a plan'. This compound word embodies the idea of laying out a careful scheme or design, which is relevant to the manager's contemplation in the scene."

            "etymology": "「叶う (kanau)」 means 'to come true' or 'to be realized', often used for wishes, dreams, or hopes. Its kanji 「叶」 is formed from 「口 (kuchi, mouth)」 and 「十 (jū, ten/complete)」, suggesting that when words are spoken completely, they come true. In the context of long-term effort, this verb emphasizes the fulfillment of aspirations."

            "etymology": "The phrase 「大失敗 (dai-shippai)」 literally means 'big failure' or 'grand failure', combining 「大 (dai)」 meaning 'big' and 「失敗 (shippai)」 meaning 'failure'. It is a common compound word in Japanese to express significant setbacks. The scene highlights this as an inevitable consequence. The use of 「度重なる (tabikasunaru)」 implies that the warnings were given multiple times, intensifying the feeling that the failure was self-inflicted and completely foreseeable, hence 「はたして」 is particularly fitting here. This use of kanji, especially 「度重なる」 (N3), is appropriate for the N2 level."

            "etymology": "「時間 通り (jikan-doori)」 means 'on time' or 'according to schedule'. 「時間 (jikan)」 means 'time', and 「通り (doori)」 comes from 「通る (tooru)」 meaning 'to pass through' or 'to go along', and when used as a suffix, it means 'according to' or 'as per'. This phrase precisely indicates adherence to a set time, which is the crux of the speaker's doubt."

            "etymology": "「直感 (chokkan)」 means 'intuition' or 'instinct'. It is composed of 「直 (choku)」 meaning 'direct' and 「感 (kan)」 meaning 'feeling' or 'sense'. This term clearly conveys a direct, unmediated understanding or feeling, which is precisely what is described as being sharp in the example."

            "etymology": "The phrase 「行動 する べき (koudou suru beki)」 means 'should act'. 「べき」 comes from a classical Japanese auxiliary verb emphasizing obligation or advisability. 「行動 (koudou)」 (N3) refers to 'action' or 'conduct', commonly seen in professional or formal contexts like the scene describes. This is a common and natural way to express what one 'should' do in a serious discussion."
