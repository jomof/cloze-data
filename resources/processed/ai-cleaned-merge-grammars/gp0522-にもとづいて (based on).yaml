jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: General
  function: To indicate the foundation or source of something.
  nuance: Emphasizes a solid, often objective, and verifiable basis for a judgment, decision, action,
    or creation. Typically used in formal or objective contexts.
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially (like a conjunctive particle) or adjectivally (when modifying
    a noun).
etymology: The grammar point 「にもとづいて」 comes from the verb 「基づく」 (motozuku), meaning "to be based on."
  It combines 「に」 (a particle indicating location or direction), 「基づく」 (the verb), and 「て」 (the te-form,
  used to connect clauses). Thus, it literally means something along the lines of "being based on [something],
  and then..."
writeup: 'The Japanese expression 「にもとづいて」 (ni motozuite) is used to state that something is "based on"
  or "in accordance with" something else. It signifies that a judgment, decision, action, or creation
  has a specific foundation or source from which it originates. The core meaning is that of a direct,
  foundational relationship. This grammar point is formed by combining the particle 「に」 (ni), the verb
  「基づく」 (motozuku), and the conjunctive particle 「て」 (te). The kanji 「基」 (moto) literally means "foundation"
  or "base," which accurately reflects the essence of this expression. Common usage patterns include:
  Noun + にもとづいて + [Verb/Sentence]: This is the most direct form, indicating that the action or statement
  that follows is based on the preceding noun. For example, 「データ {にもとづいて} 判断する」 (to make a decision based
  on data). Noun + にもとづいた + Noun: This form is used when the preceding noun modifies a subsequent noun,
  describing it as "a [Noun] based on [Noun]." For example, 「事実 {にもとづいた} 報告」 (a report based on facts).
  「にもとづいて」 is typically used in more formal or objective contexts, such as academic papers, business reports,
  legal documents, or formal discussions where the precise foundation of information or action needs to
  be clearly stated. It emphasizes a logical and verifiable basis. While 「にもとづいて」 is flexible in its conjugations,
  it primarily utilizes the `te-form` to connect clauses (e.g., 「にもとづいて」) or the `past plain form` when
  modifying nouns (e.g., 「にもとづいた」). Other conjugations of the verb 「基づく」 may also be used depending on
  the specific grammatical context, such as 「にもとづく」 (dictionary form) for general statements or principles,
  or negative forms like 「にもとづかない」 (not based on). Important Considerations: This expression implies a
  solid, often objective, foundation. It is used when the basis is verifiable, a principle, a law, data,
  or established experience. It is distinct from expressions that imply merely following instructions
  or using something as a loose reference point.'
false_friends:
  - term: にしたがって
    meaning: as, following, in accordance with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にしたがって」 implies following a set path, instructions, or a natural progression. Unlike 「にもとづいて」,
      it does not necessarily mean something is founded on something else, but rather that it conforms
      or adapts to it.
    grammar_point: に従って・従い (in accordance with and proportional change)
  - term: によると・によれば
    meaning: according to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「によると・によれば」 is used to cite a source of information (e.g., 'according to the news'). 「にもとづいて」
      refers to something serving as a foundation or basis for a judgment, action, or creation, not merely
      a source of information.
    grammar_point: によると・によれば (according to)
  - term: に合わせて・に合った
    meaning: in accordance with, matching, fitting, suitable for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に合わせて・に合った」 means something is adjusted or made to fit something else, emphasizing adaptation
      or suitability. 「にもとづいて」 means something is fundamentally derived from or built upon something else
      as a foundation.
    grammar_point: に合わせる・に合う (match or fit)
  - term: をもとに
    meaning: based on, from, according to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「を もとに」 is similar but often has a nuance of using something as raw material or a starting
      point for creation or development. While 「にもとづいて」 can also imply creation, it emphasizes a more
      formal or reasoned, foundational basis, often for principles, laws, or data.
    grammar_point: をもとに (based on)
  - term: を踏まえて
    meaning: based on, considering, keeping in mind, taking into account
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「を踏まえて」 means considering something as background or taking it into account before making
      a decision. It does not necessarily imply that the decision is directly *founded* on it, but rather
      made *in light of* it. 「にもとづいて」 denotes a direct and foundational relationship.
    grammar_point: を踏まえて (based on)
  - term: からして
    meaning: even..., judging from, based on
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「からして」 emphasizes using something as evidence for a broader judgment or inference, often with
      a critical or negative nuance (e.g., 'Judging from his rude tone, he's probably not a good person').
      「にもとづいて」 focuses on a more direct, objective, and foundational relationship for actions or creations.
    grammar_point: からして (judging from)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key distinction lies in the nature of the relationship. 「にもとづいて」 specifically
  indicates a foundational, inherent, or logical relationship, meaning something is built *upon* or derived
  *from* another element. The other expressions often suggest a relationship of alignment, adaptation,
  simple reference, or considering something as background. When a principle, law, data, or established
  fact serves as the very bedrock of a decision or creation, 「にもとづいて」 is the appropriate choice.

        english: Using the latest data, we will rethink our strategy.
        hint: 「を使って」 means 'using' or 'by means of'. While data is used, 「にもとづいて」 emphasizes the data

          relationship.

          - 最新 の データ {から}、戦略 を 練り直し ます。
        english: From the latest data, we will rethink our strategy.
        hint: While 「から」 indicates origin, it is less formal and does not convey the strong foundational
          sense of 'based on' that is appropriate for strategic business decisions. We're looking for
          a more formal and precise expression for forming a strategy.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: Following the latest data, we will rethink our strategy.
        hint: 「にしたがって」 implies conforming to or obeying the data, like rules. 「にもとづいて」 emphasizes that
          the strategy is *derived from* or *built upon* the data as a fundamental basis. We're looking
          for a strategy formed from the data.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: Adapting to the latest data, we will rethink our strategy.
        hint: 「に合わせて」 suggests adjusting the strategy to fit the data. We're looking for a grammar point
          that means the strategy is *fundamentally built upon* the data, not just modified to align with
          it.

        english: Based on the latest data, we will rethink our strategy.
        hint: While similar, 「をもとに」 often implies using something as raw material or a starting point

        english: His judgment was something created based on solid experience.
        hint: While 「を もとに」 can also mean 'based on', the scene describes a judgment rooted in 'solid
          experience' rather than something created from raw material. 「にもとづいた」 emphasizes the fundamental
          source of the judgment, which is suitable for acknowledging a senior's wisdom. We're looking
          for the inherent foundation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 判断 は 確か な 経験 {から 来 た} もの でし た。
        english: His judgment was something that came from solid experience.
        hint: 「から来た」 implies simply originating from experience, which is less precise than indicating
          that the judgment is built upon and derived from that experience. The scene's reflective tone
          suggests a deeper connection between the experience and the judgment. We're looking for a precise
          connection.
      - competing_japanese:

          and foundation of the judgment.
    scene: Two colleagues discussing a past successful decision made by a senior member. They are reflecting
      on how well his past actions were informed.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「確かな経験」 (solid experience) emphasizes the strong foundation of the judgment. The
      use of 「でした」 makes it polite and appropriate for a discussion between colleagues. The sentence implies
      that the judgment's very nature was shaped by that experience.

        english: That article contains false information where facts are not present.
        hint: The scene implies a specific relationship between the facts and the information's credibility.
          「にもとづかない」 highlights the *lack of a foundation* in facts, rather than merely stating facts are
          absent, which is critical for a reporter addressing misinformation. We're looking for the absence
          of a basis.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 記事 は {事実 と 異なる} 虚偽 の 情報 を 含ん で い ます。
        english: That article contains false information that differs from facts.
        hint: 「事実と異なる」 means 'different from facts', which suggests inaccuracy. However, 「にもとづかない」 implies
          the information has *no basis* in facts, indicating a more fundamental problem with its origin.
          This nuance is crucial for the reporter's warning. We're looking for information that lacks
          foundational support.

        hint: 「を もとに しない」 means not using something as raw material. 「にもとづかない」 emphasizes that the information

    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The negative form 「にもとづかない」 clearly states the absence of a factual basis, which is crucial
      for a reporter addressing the public about misinformation. The use of 「虚偽の情報」 (false information)
      makes the warning strong and clear. This phrase emphasizes that the information's core problem is
      its lack of foundation.

        hint: 「ニーズに合います」 suggests fitting or matching, but not necessarily that the services are *developed
          from* or *founded upon* those needs. The scene implies a fundamental principle of operation,
          for which 「にもとづきます」 is more appropriate. We're looking for services derived from needs.

        english: Our company's services always consider customer needs.
        hint: 「考慮します」 means 'consider', which is weaker than requiring the decision to be *founded* upon
          those grounds. The scene's context of core principles calls for a stronger statement of foundation.
          We're looking for services built upon needs.

          suggests the needs are the fundamental principles upon which the services are designed. We're
          looking for services whose core principle is customer needs.

        english: This design was created from traditional Japanese aesthetic principles.
        hint: While 「から」 can denote origin, 「にもとづいて」 conveys that the design is fundamentally built upon
          and informed by the aesthetic principles. The academic setting calls for a more precise and
          foundational relationship. We're looking for a design deeply informed by principles.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 設計 は、日本 の 伝統 的 な 美 意識 を {参考 に} 作ら れ まし た。
        english: This design was created by referencing traditional Japanese aesthetic principles.
        hint: 「参考 に」 means 'referencing' or 'for reference', which is too weak for something that is entirely
          *derived from* or *rooted in* a set of principles. The scene implies a deep influence, making
          「にもとづいて」 more fitting. We're looking for a design fundamentally stemming from principles.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 設計 は、日本 の 伝統 的 な 美 意識 {に したがっ て} 作ら れ まし た。
        english: This design was created following traditional Japanese aesthetic principles.
        hint: 「にしたがって」 implies adhering to principles like rules. 「にもとづいて」 emphasizes that the design
          is *fundamentally shaped by* or *derived from* those principles as its core. We're looking for
          a design whose very essence is rooted in those principles.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 設計 は、日本 の 伝統 的 な 美 意識 {に 合わせ て} 作ら れ まし た。
        english: This design was created to fit traditional Japanese aesthetic principles.
        hint: 「に合わせて」 suggests adapting the design to fit the principles. 「にもとづいて」 means the principles
          serve as the *foundational concept* for the design, implying a deeper influence. We're looking
          for a design built upon those principles.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 設計 は、日本 の 伝統 的 な 美 意識 {を 踏まえ て} 作ら れ まし た。
        english: This design was created considering traditional Japanese aesthetic principles.
        hint: 「を踏まえて」 means taking principles into account. 「にもとづいて」 indicates the principles are the
          *originating basis* for the design, suggesting a more fundamental connection. We're looking
          for a design where the principles are the underlying foundation.
    scene: A curator explaining the philosophy behind an artwork or building design at an exhibition,
      emphasizing its cultural roots.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The formal phrasing and use of 「作られました」 (was created) are appropriate for an academic context,
      indicating a deliberate and foundational application of cultural principles to the design. The phrase
      「伝統的な美意識」 (traditional aesthetic principles) highlights the deep cultural basis, showing the design
      is inherently shaped by these principles.
  - english: Their claim was not based on sufficient evidence.
    japanese:
      - 彼 ら の 主張 は、十分 な 証拠 {に もとづき ませ ん でし た}。
      - 彼 ら の 主張 は、十分 な 証拠 {に もとづい て} い ませ ん でし た。
    english_literally: Their claim sufficient evidence based on was.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 ら の 主張 は、十分 な 証拠 {が あり ませ ん でし た}。
        english: Their claim did not have sufficient evidence.
        hint: 「にもとづきませんでした」 doesn't just say there was no evidence; it states the claim lacked a *foundation*
          in evidence, directly attacking its validity. This is stronger for a persuasive legal argument.
          We're looking for a claim that was baseless.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 ら の 主張 は、十分 な 証拠 {に 欠け て い まし た}。
        english: Their claim was missing sufficient evidence.
        hint: 「に欠けていました」 means 'lacked' or 'was missing'. While similar, 「にもとづきませんでした」 specifically negates
          the foundational aspect, implying the claim was baseless from the start. This aligns with a
          lawyer's goal of undermining the opponent's case. We're looking for a claim that had no inherent
          support.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 ら の 主張 は、十分 な 証拠 {を もと に し て い ませ ん でし た}。
        english: Their claim was not based on sufficient evidence (as raw material).
        hint: 「を もとに していませんでした」 means they didn't use evidence as a basis. 「にもとづきませんでした」 means the claim
          inherently lacked a fundamental foundation in evidence, suggesting it was inherently unsound.
          We're looking for a claim that wasn't built on evidence.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 ら の 主張 は、十分 な 証拠 {を 踏まえ て い ませ ん でし た}。
        english: Their claim did not take sufficient evidence into account.
        hint: 「を踏まえていませんでした」 means they didn't consider the evidence. 「にもとづきませんでした」 suggests the claim
          itself had no foundational backing from the evidence, indicating a deeper flaw. We're looking
          for a claim without foundational backing.
    scene: A lawyer presenting their closing argument in court, systematically debunking the opposition's
      statements due to lack of factual support.
    register: formal
    setting: persuasive
    conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The formal negative past polite form 「にもとづきませんでした」 is used to clearly state the lack of a
      foundation for the opposing claim, effective in a persuasive and formal legal context. It directly
      attacks the validity of the claim by pointing out its lack of underlying support.

        english: The professor's paper was written from many years of meticulous research.
        hint: While the paper originates 'from' the research, 「にもとづきました」 highlights that the research
          forms the direct, underlying foundation and justification for the paper's conclusions. The academic
          context supports this more precise nuance of being 'founded upon'. We're looking for research
          as the core basis.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 教授 の 論文 は、長年 の 丹念 な 研究 {の 結果 でし た}。
        english: The professor's paper was the result of many years of meticulous research.
        hint: 「の結果」 means 'as a result', which is a consequence, not necessarily the basis upon which
          something is built. The scene suggests the research directly supports and informs the paper's
          content, making 「にもとづきました」 more apt. We're looking for research that directly informs the paper.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 教授 の 論文 は、長年 の 丹念 な 研究 {を もと に} 書か れ まし た。

          material).
        hint: While 「を もと に」 can mean using research as a source, 「にもとづきました」 emphasizes that the research
          forms the precise and authoritative foundation upon which the paper's arguments and conclusions
          are built. We're looking for research as the authoritative foundation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 教授 の 論文 は、長年 の 丹念 な 研究 {を 踏まえ て} 書か れ まし た。
        english: The professor's paper was written considering many years of meticulous research.
        hint: 「を踏まえて」 means the paper was written *in light of* the research. 「にもとづきました」 implies the research
          is the *fundamental basis* and validation for the paper itself, suggesting a stronger connection.
          We're looking for research that validates the paper.
    scene: A university student enthusiastically recommending a research paper to a classmate, emphasizing
      its academic rigor.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: This sentence reflects a respectful and appreciative tone for the professor's work. The phrase
      「長年 の 丹念な 研究」 (many years of meticulous research) highlights the solid and extensive foundation
      of the paper, making it credible and impressive to another student. It emphasizes that the paper
      is structurally built upon this research.

        english: Following the code of ethics, that decision was withdrawn.
        hint: While 「に 従って」 means 'following' or 'in accordance with', it implies adherence to rules.
          「にもとづいて」 emphasizes that the ethical code serves as the *fundamental reason* or *basis* for
          the decision's reversal, making it a stronger justification. We're looking for the foundational
          reason for the withdrawal.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 倫理 規定 を {守る ため に}、その 決定 は 撤回 さ れ まし た。
        english: In order to protect the code of ethics, that decision was withdrawn.
        hint: 「守る ため に」 means 'in order to protect/abide by'. This focuses on the *purpose* of the action.
          「にもとづいて」 focuses on the *source* or *foundation* for the action, which is more appropriate for
          explaining a decision's justification. We're looking for the basis of the action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 倫理 規定 {に 合わせ て}、その 決定 は 撤回 さ れ まし た。
        english: The decision was withdrawn to fit the code of ethics.

        english: Based on the code of ethics (as a starting point), the decision was withdrawn.
        hint: While 「を もと に」 can imply a basis, 「にもとづいて」 conveys that the ethical code is the *direct
          and authoritative foundation* requiring the decision's withdrawal, especially in a formal context.
          We're looking for the code as the direct, authoritative foundation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 倫理 規定 {を 踏まえ て}、その 決定 は 撤回 さ れ まし た。
        english: Considering the code of ethics, that decision was withdrawn.
        hint: 「を踏まえて」 means taking the code into account. 「にもとづいて」 signifies that the code is the *foundational
          justification* or *mandate* for the withdrawal, implying a deeper, more compelling reason. We're
          looking for the code as the fundamental justification.
    scene: A company spokesperson announcing a reversal of a previous controversial decision, explaining
      that it was necessary to align with ethical standards.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: te-form (～て)

    listener_gender: group

      announcements. The grammar point here emphasizes that the ethical code is the foundational principle
      that necessitated the reversal, implying a strict adherence to internal standards and a clear, objective
      basis for the action.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「にもとづいて」 is versatile and can be used in various
  situations, from business to academic to casual conversation, whenever a strong, verifiable basis is
  being emphasized. Pay close attention to its conjugations, especially the te-form 「にもとづいて」 and the past
  plain form 「にもとづいた」 when modifying nouns, as these are very common. The nuance of a solid, often objective
  foundation remains consistent across its uses.
