    "etymology": "The grammar point 「すぎる」 comes from the verb 「過ぎる(すぎる)」, meaning \"to pass,\" \"to exceed,\" or \"to go beyond.\" When attached to the stem of a verb or adjective, it retains this sense of exceeding a limit, thus indicating 'too much'.",
    "writeup": "「すぎる」 is a verb that, on its own, means \"to exceed\" or \"to go past.\" It maintains this meaning when attached to other words, creating the Japanese equivalent of saying something is \"too much.\" It can be joined to the ます-stem of verbs (e.g., 食べ**ます** → 食べ**すぎる**), the stem form of い-adjectives (remove the い, e.g., 高**い** → 高**すぎる**), or the stem form of な-adjectives (remove the な, e.g., 静か**な** → 静か**すぎる**). This is a very common pattern.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   「すぎる」 itself is a verb, so it can be conjugated into various forms, including negative forms. Be mindful of where the 「ない」 is placed, as it can significantly alter the meaning. For example, 「食べすぎない」 means \"don't eat too much,\" while 「食べなさすぎない」 (though grammatically complex) is a double negative meaning something akin to \"eating adequately.\"\n*   When using 「すぎる」 with 「いい」 (good), the stem form of 「いい」 is 「よ」, not 「い」. Therefore, the correct form is 「よすぎる」, not 「いすぎる」.",
