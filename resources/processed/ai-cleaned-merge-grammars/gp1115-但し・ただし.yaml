        "function": "To introduce a condition, exception, or restriction to a preceding statement.",

        "logical-flow": "Introduces a conditional or exceptional statement that modifies or narrows the scope of the preceding statement."

    "etymology": "「但し」comes from the verb 「但つ(tatsu)」, meaning \"to add on\" or \"to supplement.\" It indicates adding a condition or exception to what was previously stated. 「ただし」is the hiragana form and is used interchangeably with 「但し」.",
    "writeup": "「但し」 (tadashi) is a formal conjunction used to introduce a condition, exception, or restriction to a preceding statement. It functions similarly to \"however,\" \"but,\" or \"provided that\" in English. It is notably more formal and precise than simpler conjunctions like **しかし** (shikashi) or **でも** (demo). While it can be used in spoken language, it typically appears in more formal or prepared speech, often in settings such as business, legal, academic, or official announcements, rather than in casual conversation. Its primary function is to add a proviso or a specific detail that limits the scope or application of the general statement made previously, ensuring clarity and precision.",
