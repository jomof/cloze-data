    "etymology": "The word 「せい」 is derived from 「所為」 (shoi), which literally means \"doings\" or \"actions.\" It implies that a negative outcome is a result of someone's or something's actions.",
    "writeup": "「せい」 is a noun, often written in hiragana though it originates from the kanji form 「所為」, meaning \"doings.\" It expresses that a negative result occurred due to a particular cause, action, or person. Thus, it conveys blame, fault, or cause. It's similar to saying \"it's the doing of...\" in English, implying a negative responsibility. Because it is a noun, 「せい」 follows nouns with the particle 「の」 and verbs/adjectives in their short form. The particle 「で」 is often added after 「せい」, particularly when indicating the result that occurred because of those \"doings.\"",

Use 「おかげで」 when expressing gratitude for a positive outcome, 「ために」 when stating a reason for a neutral or positive outcome, and 「そのため(に)」 when focusing on the logical consequence. 「につき」 is best used when discussing reasons related to quantities or distributions. 「から」 is a neutral way to express cause without any emotional implication.",

This emphasizes that the coldness is directly responsible for the negative outcome (catching a cold), subtly implying the cold is to blame for the discomfort. The phrase 「風邪をひいちゃったよ」 uses 「ひいちゃった」 (a contraction of 「ひいてしまった」) to convey a sense of regret or lament over catching a cold, and the 「よ」 particle adds a sense of assertion or informing the listener.",
