    "etymology": "The word 「せい」 is derived from 「所為」 (shoi), which literally means \"doings\" or \"actions.\" It implies that a negative outcome is a result of someone's or something's actions.",
    "writeup": "「せい」 is a noun, often written in hiragana though it originates from the kanji form 「所為」, meaning \"doings.\" It expresses that a negative result occurred due to a particular cause, action, or person. Thus, it conveys blame, fault, or cause. It's similar to saying \"it's the doing of...\" in English, implying a negative responsibility. Because it is a noun, 「せい」 follows nouns with the particle 「の」 and verbs/adjectives in their short form. The particle 「で」 is often added after 「せい」, particularly when indicating the result that occurred because of those \"doings.\"",

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies a negative consequence (being late for class) where the speaker feels some personal responsibility or blame for staying up late, which is better captured by 「せい」 than the neutral 「ために」."

                    "competing_grammar": "昨夜、遅くまでテレビを見ていたから、今朝は寝坊した。",
                    "mitigation": "While 「から」 states a reason, 「せい」 adds the nuance of a negative consequence or blame, which fits the apologetic and slightly regretful tone of being late for class."

The use of {せい} strongly implies a negative consequence, suggesting the speaker views staying up late as the direct cause of their oversleeping, perhaps with a sense of self-blame or regret."

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies the speaker attributes their illness directly to the cold, with a subtle undertone of blame towards the weather, which 「せい」 conveys more strongly than the general reason-giving 「から」."
