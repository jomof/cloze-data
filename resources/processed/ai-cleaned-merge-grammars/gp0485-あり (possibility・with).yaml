details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  function: Indicates the presence of something or suggests a possibility.
  nuance: Implies that something is an option among others.
etymology: The term 「あり」 originates from the literary form of the verb 「有る (ある)」, meaning 'to be' or 'to
  exist'. It functions similarly to 「なし (nashi)」, but instead of indicating the absence of something,
  it highlights the presence or possibility of something within a broader context. It is important to
  note that the kanji 「有り」 emphasizes 'inclusiveness as part of a whole', while the kanji 「在り」 focuses
  more on 'stand-alone existence'.
writeup: |-
  「あり」, while literally the literary form of 「有る」 ('to be'), functions in modern Japanese to indicate that something **is** an option or possibility. It suggests that the mentioned item or feature is present or could be considered among other options. It is similar to 「なし」, but with the opposite meaning; instead of indicating something is 'without (A)', it implies something is 'with (A)'.

  **Key Usage**:

  *   **Indicating Possibility**: Used to suggest something as a possible option. Often seen with 「～もいい」 or 「～じゃない」 patterns.
  *   **Describing Features**: Indicates that something has a particular feature or amenity. For example, 「駐車場あり」 means 'with parking'.

  **Important Considerations**:

  *   The implication is always that it is one of multiple possibilities.
  *   The kanji 「有り」 indicates 'inclusiveness as part of a whole', while 「在り」 focuses more on 'stand-alone existence'.
  *   While its core register is casual, 「あり」 can be used in semi-formal or professional contexts when combined with polite endings like 「です」, making it quite versatile.

  - term: ある
    meaning: to exist (inanimate objects); to have
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ある」 indicates the general existence or possession of something, whereas 「あり」 specifies something
      as one of several possibilities or features.
    grammar_point: ある (to exist or have)
  - term: いい
    meaning: good; acceptable
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「いい」 broadly means 'good' or 'acceptable', 「あり」 specifically suggests something is a
      valid possibility or acceptable option among a range of choices, often implying a less formal or
      more open-ended consideration.
    grammar_point: いい (good)
  - term: 選択肢
    meaning: choice; option
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「選択肢」 is a formal noun meaning 'choice' or 'option', whereas 「あり」 is a more casual and concise
      way to state that something is a valid possibility or acceptable option.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:選択肢 (choice)
  - term: 有り難う
    meaning: Thank you
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「有り難う」 is a fixed expression of gratitude, and despite containing the character 「有」, it is
      phonetically and semantically unrelated to the use of 「あり」 for possibility or presence.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:有り難う (thank you)
post_false_friends_writeup: It is important to distinguish between 「あり」 and 「ある」. 「ある」 is a basic verb
  meaning "to exist" or "to have," while 「あり」, when used as a modifier, indicates a possibility or a feature
  among others. Similarly, while 「有り難う」 contains the kanji 「有」, it is a fixed expression for gratitude
  and not related to the grammar point's meaning. Additionally, while expressions using 「いい」 or 「選択肢」
  can convey similar ideas of acceptability or option, 「あり」 specifically focuses on something being a
  *valid possibility among others*, often with a more colloquial nuance than the formal 「選択肢」.
