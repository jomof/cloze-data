  Noun + を兼ねて: Indicates doing something for multiple purposes or reasons. If multiple secondary goals

    both exercise and health maintenance).

details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: general use
etymology: The grammar point 「を兼ねて」 is derived from the verb 「兼ねる (かねる)」, which means "to combine," "to
  hold concurrently," or "to double as." The particle 「を」 marks the noun that represents one of the purposes
  or functions.
writeup: The grammar pattern 「を兼ねて」 is derived from the verb 「兼ねる (かねる)」, which fundamentally means "to
  combine," "to hold concurrently," or "to double as." This pattern indicates that an action serves multiple
  purposes or functions simultaneously. The particle 「を」 marks the noun that represents one of the secondary
  purposes or functions being achieved. The structure can often be translated as "to do X, also for Y,"
  "to double as Y," or "to achieve X while also serving Y." It emphasizes that while a primary action
  is being undertaken, it concurrently fulfills another goal or role. This often implies that the marked
  noun (Y) is a secondary, yet still important, objective that naturally aligns with or can be conveniently
  combined with the primary action (X). When listing multiple secondary goals, the case-marking particle
  「と」 can be used instead of or in addition to 「を」. This phrase is typically used in slightly more formal
  or considerate contexts to highlight efficiency or intentional multi-tasking.

  - term: かねる
    meaning: Cannot, be unable to, hard to, hesitant to
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「を兼ねて」, 「かねる」 (when used as a suffix like ～かねる) expresses inability or hesitation to
      do something. For example, 「賛成しかねます」 means "I cannot agree." They share the same kanji but have
      distinct grammatical functions and meanings.
    grammar_point: かねる (unable to)
  - term: のために
    meaning: For the purpose of, in order to
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「のために」 indicates a single, direct purpose or reason for an action, 「を兼ねて」 signifies
      that an action serves multiple purposes concurrently. 「のために」 emphasizes the sole objective, whereas
      「を兼ねて」 highlights a beneficial duality.
    grammar_point: ため (purpose・reason)
  - term: ついでに
    meaning: Taking the opportunity, while at it
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「を兼ねて」 which implies a deliberate combination of multiple intended purposes from the
      outset, 「ついでに」 suggests performing a secondary action opportunistically while already doing something
      else. The secondary action in 「ついでに」 is usually less planned or of lesser significance than the
      primary action.
    grammar_point: ついでに (taking the opportunity)
  - term: Noun・Verb・Adjective+ばかりか~(さえ)
    meaning: Not only...but also; much more than; in addition to.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「を兼ねて」 highlights that a single action serves multiple intended purposes, 「ばかりか～(さえ)」
      focuses on adding an extra element or outcome. It emphasizes that something not only possesses one
      characteristic or result but also a further one, often surprising or exceeding expectation, without
      necessarily implying a deliberate, combined intention from the start.
    grammar_point: Noun・Verb・Adjective+ばかりか~(さえ) (not only ~ but also)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key distinction between these expressions lies in intentionality and scope.
  「を兼ねて」 always implies a deliberate action undertaken to fulfill two or more concurrent purposes. In
  contrast, 「かねる」 (as a suffix) denotes inability or hesitation. 「のために」 specifies a single, primary objective.
  「ついでに」 suggests an opportunistic, less central secondary action. Lastly, 「ばかりか～(さえ)」 emphasizes that
  something has additional characteristics or outcomes, often exceeding expectations, rather than a planned
  combination of purposes. Understanding these nuances is crucial for accurate expression in Japanese.
