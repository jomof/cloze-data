    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を兼ねて」 is derived from the verb 「兼ねる (かねる)」, which means \"to combine,\" \"to hold concurrently,\" or \"to double as.\" The particle 「を」 marks the noun that represents one of the purposes or functions.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「を兼ねて」 is derived from the verb 「兼ねる (かねる)」, which fundamentally means \"to combine,\" \"to hold concurrently,\" or \"to double as.\" This pattern indicates that an action serves multiple purposes or functions simultaneously. The particle 「を」 marks the noun that represents one of the secondary purposes or functions being achieved. The structure can often be translated as \"to do X, also for Y,\" \"to double as Y,\" or \"to achieve X while also serving Y.\" It emphasizes that while a primary action is being undertaken, it concurrently fulfills another goal or role. This often implies that the marked noun (Y) is a secondary, yet still important, objective that naturally aligns with or can be conveniently combined with the primary action (X). When listing multiple secondary goals, the case-marking particle 「と」 can be used instead of or in addition to 「を」.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「を兼ねて」, 「かねる」 (when used as a suffix like ～かねる) expresses inability or hesitation to do something. For example, 「賛成しかねます」 means \"I cannot agree.\" They share the same kanji but have distinct grammatical functions and meanings.",

            "nuance": "While 「のために」 indicates a single, direct purpose or reason for an action, 「を兼ねて」 signifies that an action serves multiple purposes concurrently. 「のために」 emphasizes the sole objective, whereas 「を兼ねて」 highlights a beneficial duality.",
            "grammar_point": "ため (purpose, reason)"
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference is that 「を兼ねて」 combines two or more purposes into one action, whereas 「かねる」, when used as a suffix, expresses an inability or difficulty in doing something. Similarly, while 「のために」 states a singular, direct purpose, 「を兼ねて」 emphasizes the dual nature of an action serving multiple benefits simultaneously. If you intend to convey that an action serves multiple functions, use 「を兼ねて」. If you want to express that something is difficult or impossible, use 「～かねる」, and if you want to state a sole purpose, use 「のために」.",
