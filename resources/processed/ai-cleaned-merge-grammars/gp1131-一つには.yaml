        "function": "To present one of several reasons, objectives, or benefits that contribute to a larger outcome.",
        "nuance": "Used when providing explanations or justifications, highlighting one significant factor among others, often implying there are other contributing factors.",
        "colocation": "Frequently used in conjunction with 「もう一つには」 (another reason is) to provide multiple explanations or aspects."
    },
    "etymology": "Derived from 「一つ」 (one) and 「には」 (as for), literally meaning 'as for one thing,' which evolved to indicate one specific point or reason out of many.",
    "writeup": "The adverbial phrase 「一つには」 is employed to introduce one particular reason, objective, or benefit contributing to a situation. It functions as a way to say \"partly because of this,\" \"for one thing,\" or \"one reason is.\" This expression is particularly common in formal or semi-formal contexts, both in spoken and written Japanese, when providing explanations or justifications.\n\nWhile 「一つには」 can stand alone to introduce a singular contributing factor, it is very frequently paired with 「もう一つには」 (another reason is) to list additional, equally important, or contrasting reasons or aspects. This pairing allows for a structured and balanced presentation of multiple contributing factors.\n\nThe grammatical structure often involves a clause followed by 「の/である理由は一つには〜からだ/ためだ」. This allows 「一つには」 to connect to various parts of speech:\n*   **Verbs (plain form):** 「〜（する）のは{一つには}〜からだ」 (One reason for doing X is because...)\n*   **い-Adjectives (plain form):** 「〜（い）のは{一つには}〜からだ」 (One reason for being X is because...)\n*   **な-Adjectives (stem + な/だった):** 「〜（な）のは{一つには}〜からだ」 (One reason for being X is because...)\n*   **Nouns (の/である):** 「〜（なの/である）理由は{一つには}〜からだ」 (One reason for X is because...)\n\nIt is essential to recognize that 「一つには」 signals a partial explanation, implying that other factors exist or will be mentioned. It is a nuanced way to acknowledge complexity rather than offering a sole, definitive cause.",

            "nuance": "While 「一つには」 emphasizes that the following point is *one part* of a reason or explanation, 「一つは」 simply introduces one item in a list or states 'one thing is...' without necessarily implying a partial contribution to a larger outcome. 「一つには」 carries a stronger sense of being a contributing factor."

            "nuance": "「まず」 indicates the order of actions or priorities, meaning 'firstly' or 'to start with.' It doesn't inherently imply that the point is a *reason* among others. 「一つには」 specifically denotes one contributing *reason* or aspect, rather than just the initial point in a sequence."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between 「一つには」 and similar expressions, consider whether you are merely listing items or actions in order (where 「まず」 might be appropriate) or if you are presenting a contributing cause or aspect among several (where 「一つには」 is more suitable). Similarly, 「一つは」 can introduce one item in a list, but 「一つには」 specifically highlights that this item is *part* of the explanation or reason for a broader situation, often implying other factors exist.",

            "etymology": "The structure 「〜のは〜からだ」 (A is because of B) is a very common way to express causality in Japanese. The 「の」 here acts as a nominalizer, turning the preceding clause into a noun phrase, allowing it to be the subject of the sentence."

            "etymology": "The nominalizer 「の」 when following a な-adjective (like 「人気な」) often becomes 「なの」, especially in explanatory or causal contexts. This usage stems from making the adjective clause function as a noun, allowing it to be followed by particles like 「は」."

            "etymology": "The phrase 「〜のため」 indicates purpose or reason, literally 'for the sake of ~'. Its versatility allows it to combine with various nouns or noun phrases to express a wide range of motivations, like 「健康のため」 (for health) or 「ストレス解消のため」 (for stress relief)."

            "etymology": "The construction 「〜によるものだ」 (literally 'is a thing that depends on ~') is a common way to express causality or attribution, often used in formal or academic contexts to describe something that results from or is caused by another factor."
