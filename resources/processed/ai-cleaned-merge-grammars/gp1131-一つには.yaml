        "function": "To present one of several reasons, objectives, or benefits that contribute to a larger outcome.",
        "nuance": "Used when providing explanations or justifications, highlighting one significant factor among others, often implying there are other contributing factors.",
        "colocation": "Frequently used in conjunction with 「もう一つには」 (another reason is) to provide multiple explanations or aspects."
    },
    "etymology": "Derived from 「一つ」 (one) and 「には」 (as for), literally meaning 'as for one thing,' which evolved to indicate one specific point or reason out of many.",
    "writeup": "The adverbial phrase 「一つには」 is employed to introduce one particular reason, objective, or benefit contributing to a situation. It functions as a way to say \"partly because of this,\" \"for one thing,\" or \"one reason is.\" This expression is particularly common in formal or semi-formal contexts, both in spoken and written Japanese, when providing explanations or justifications.\n\nWhile 「一つには」 can stand alone to introduce a singular contributing factor, it is very frequently paired with 「もう一つには」 (another reason is) to list additional, equally important, or contrasting reasons or aspects. This pairing allows for a structured and balanced presentation of multiple contributing factors.\n\nThe grammatical structure often involves a clause followed by 「の/である理由は一つには〜からだ/ためだ」. This allows 「一つには」 to connect to various parts of speech:\n*   **Verbs (plain form):** 「〜（する）のは一つには〜からだ」 (One reason for doing X is because...)\n*   **い-Adjectives (plain form):** 「〜（い）のは一つには〜からだ」 (One reason for being X is because...)\n*   **な-Adjectives (stem + な/だった):** 「〜（な）のは一つには〜からだ」 (One reason for being X is because...)\n*   **Nouns (の/である):** 「〜（なの/である）理由は一つには〜からだ」 (One reason for X is because...)\n\nIt is essential to recognize that 「一つには」 signals a partial explanation, implying that other factors exist or will be mentioned. It is a nuanced way to acknowledge complexity rather than offering a sole, definitive cause.",
