meaning: The formation of compound nouns where a verb stem is combined with a noun to create a new noun,
  often referring to a tool or object related to the verb's action.
pronunciation:

  romaji: Doushigokan Meishi
formation:
  Verb-stem + Noun: Forms a compound noun, often an object or tool associated with the verb's action.
jlpt: N3
etymology: Many Japanese nouns, especially those denoting tools, objects, or places, are formed through
  a process called 'compound word formation.' This particular pattern, combining a verb's stem (which
  often carries the core meaning of an action) with a noun, is a highly productive way to create concise
  and descriptive terms. The resulting noun encapsulates the object's primary function or origin. For
  example, a '引き出し' (drawer) is literally something 'pulled out' (`引く` + `出す` -> `引き出し`). This linguistic
  efficiency reflects how objects are often named for their utility or the action associated with them,
  creating a direct semantic link between function and name.
writeup: |-
  Japanese is rich in compound words, and one common and fascinating pattern involves combining the stem of a verb with a noun to create a new, distinct noun. These resulting nouns often refer to tools, objects, or places that are directly associated with the action of the verb.

  Unlike simple verb nominalizations (e.g., adding `こと` or `の` to a verb), these compounds are fixed lexical items. They are established words found in dictionaries, not phrases created spontaneously in conversation. The verb stem typically indicates the primary function or purpose of the object, offering a glimpse into how Japanese speakers perceive and categorize the world around them.

  For instance, `引く` (to pull) combines with `出し` (something taken out, itself a nominalization of `出す` to take out) to form `引き出し` (drawer), an object whose defining characteristic is that it is pulled out. Similarly, `敷く` (to spread out) combines with `布団` (bedding) to create `敷き布団` (futon mattress), literally a 'spread-out futon'. Understanding this pattern can help you not only expand your vocabulary but also appreciate the descriptive and efficient nature of Japanese word formation. While the formation principle is consistent, the exact pronunciation can sometimes involve sound changes (known as rendaku) depending on the components, and the second element (the noun) can vary widely.

  - term: '[Verb-stem]Noun (nominalization)'
    meaning: Nominalization of a verb stem, often describing an general action, state, or method.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both `[Verb-stem][Noun] (compound words for tools・objects)` and `[Verb-stem]Noun (nominalization)`
      use a verb stem followed by a noun, their resulting meanings differ significantly. The former specifically
      forms concrete nouns referring to tools, objects, or places (e.g., `書き物` - 'writing/document' as
      an object). The latter creates more abstract nouns, or nouns describing a transient state or the
      'way' of doing something (e.g., `話し方` - 'way of speaking', `読みかけ` - 'half-read'). The key distinction
      lies in the concreteness and lexicalization of the target noun.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-stem]Noun (nominalization)
post_false_friends_writeup: It is crucial to differentiate between fixed compound nouns for tools/objects
  and more general nominalizations. Compound nouns like `履き物` (footwear) are established vocabulary that
  name specific, tangible items. In contrast, general nominalizations like `歩き方` (way of walking) are
  more productive patterns used to describe the manner or state of an action, rather than naming a distinct
  object. Paying attention to whether the resulting word refers to a concrete item or an abstract concept
  is key to avoiding confusion.
