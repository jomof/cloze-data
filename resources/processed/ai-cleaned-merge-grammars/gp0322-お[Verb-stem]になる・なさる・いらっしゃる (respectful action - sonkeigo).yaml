formation:
  お + Japanese origin verb stem + になる: Expresses respect for someone's actions or states when the verb
    is of Japanese origin (訓読み).
  ご + Chinese origin verb stem + になる: Expresses respect for someone's actions or states when the verb
    is of Chinese origin (音読み).
  なさる: Honorific form of する, indicating the action of someone you respect.
  いらっしゃる: Honorific form of いる, 行く, and 来る, indicating the existence, arrival, or departure of a respected
    person.
  いらっしゃい: A common greeting for customers entering a store, derived from the imperative form, often shortened
    from いらっしゃいませ, to welcome and address them politely.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to show respect for the actions, existence, or movement of someone of higher status.
    Never used for one's own actions.
  function: Elevates the action, existence, or movement of the subject to show respect.
  nuance: These forms convey politeness and respect by indirectly describing an action or state. The choice
    between お and ご depends on the etymology of the verb stem (お for Japanese-origin, ご for Chinese-origin),
    while なさる and いらっしゃる are irregular honorific verbs for specific actions. This indirectness and careful
    choice of vocabulary are hallmarks of respectful Japanese.
  colocation: Often used with subjects like 先生 (teacher), 社長 (company president), 教授 (professor), お客様
    (customer).
  grammatical-role: Functions as a main verb or auxiliary verb, replacing or modifying the base verb to
    express honorific meaning.
  logical-flow: Elevates the action or state of the subject.
etymology: The formation お〜になる combines a polite prefix (お or ご) with the verb なる (to become), indirectly
  elevating the action to a respectful level. なさる is derived from 為す(なす), meaning 'to do' or 'to perform,'
  with the honorific suffix 〜なさ. いらっしゃる is an honorific form of いる (to be), 行く (to go), and 来る (to come),
  believed to originate from a combination of 入る (to enter) and 在る (to be). Together, these forms represent
  various strategies for conveying respect through language, often by making the expression less direct
  or by using specialized verbs.
writeup: |-
  お〜になる, なさる, and いらっしゃる are essential components of 尊敬語 (sonkeigo), the respectful language in Japanese, used to honor the actions, existence, or movement of people superior to you, such as your boss, teachers, customers, or elders. It is crucial to remember that you should **never** use these forms to describe your own actions or those of your in-group when speaking to an out-group member; doing so would be considered arrogant or inappropriate.

  **お〜になる / ご〜になる** is a general honorific construction. You attach お (for Japanese-origin verbs, 訓読み) or ご (for Chinese-origin verbs, 音読み) to the verb's stem, then add になる. This indirect approach of saying 'to become' an action subtly elevates the action itself. For instance, 読む (to read) becomes お読みになる (to respectfully read), and 連絡する (to contact) becomes ご連絡になる (to respectfully contact).

  **なさる** is a specific, irregular honorific verb for する (to do). While お〜になる can also be used for する (e.g., お勉強になる for 'to study respectfully'), なさる is its dedicated honorific counterpart and is very common. For example, 先生がご説明なさる (The teacher explains respectfully) is often used instead of 先生がご説明になる.

  **いらっしゃる** is another irregular honorific verb that covers three common verbs: いる (to be/exist), 行く (to go), and 来る (to come). Its versatility makes it a frequently used honorific in various situations, from greeting customers (いらっしゃいませ) to asking about a superior's whereabouts. For example, 社長はいらっしゃいますか？ (Is the president there?) or 先生はどちらにいらっしゃいましたか？ (Where did the teacher go?).

  The choice between these forms depends on the base verb and sometimes on nuance or common usage. While お〜になる is broadly applicable, なさる and いらっしゃる are often preferred for する, いる, 行く, and 来る due to their established usage and slightly higher level of politeness or naturalness in certain contexts. Mastering these forms is key to navigating formal and polite Japanese interactions successfully.

  - term: いたす (to do, humble)
    meaning: To do (Humble)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike these honorific forms which elevate the subject of the sentence, いたす is a humble verb
      used to lower the speaker in relation to the listener.
    grammar_point: お[Verb-stem]する・いたす (humble action - kenjougo)
  - term: なさい (polite imperative)
    meaning: Do (something)! (polite imperative)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While related etymologically, なさい is a direct polite command. In contrast, なさる is an honorific
      verb form that respectfully describes someone else's action, not a direct command.
    grammar_point: なさい (polite imperative)
  - term: する (to do・make)
    meaning: To do, to make, to play
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: する is the basic, neutral verb for 'to do'. なさる is its honorific counterpart, used to show
      respect, while お〜になる can also make other verbs respectful. Using する instead of an honorific form
      indicates a lack of respect in a formal setting.
    grammar_point: する (to do・make)
  - term: いる (to exist, animate)
    meaning: To be, there is, to remain (in a state)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: いる is the basic, neutral verb for 'to be' or 'to exist' for animate objects. いらっしゃる is its
      honorific equivalent, exclusively used when referring to a respected person. Using いる instead of
      いらっしゃる for a superior would be impolite.
    grammar_point: いる (to exist, animate)
  - term: 来る (to come)
    meaning: To come
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 来る is the basic, neutral verb for 'to come'. いらっしゃる is its honorific equivalent, used to show
      respect to the person arriving. Using 来る for a respected person's arrival is generally impolite.
    grammar_point: くる (come)
  - term: 行く (to go)
    meaning: To go; to move away from the speaker.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 行く is the basic, neutral verb for 'to go'. いらっしゃる is its honorific equivalent, used to show
      respect to the person departing. Using 行く for a respected person's departure is typically impolite.
    grammar_point: 行く (to go)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'When choosing among these expressions, remember the fundamental principle:
  honorific forms (お〜になる, なさる, いらっしゃる) are always used to show respect for the actions of others, never
  your own. Conversely, いたす is a humble form used to lower yourself. Basic verbs like する, いる, 行く, and
  来る are neutral and do not convey respect, making them inappropriate for superiors in formal contexts.
  なさる and いらっしゃる are irregular but commonly used, while お〜になる is a more general pattern applicable to
  a wider range of verbs.'

      information, making the statement more indirect and respectful in a workplace setting.

      immediately shifts to service-oriented inquiry.
  - english: Hearing that the president became angry, we were all surprised.
    japanese:
      - 社長 が お 怒り に {なら れ た} と 聞い て、私 たち は 皆 驚き まし た。

    competing_grammar:

          - 社長 が 怒っ た と 聞い て、私 たち は 皆 驚き まし た。
        english: Hearing that the president became angry, we were all surprised.
        hint: Using the plain form 怒った (got angry) is too direct and lacks the respect required for someone
          of the president's high status, even when describing a negative emotion. We need to use an honorific
          form to show proper deference.
    scene: Employees discuss the president's unexpected anger.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The use of お怒りになられた (a double honorific form for 怒る, combining お〜になる with the honorific passive
      〜られる) emphasizes extreme respect, even when describing a negative emotion like anger. This is particularly
      fitting for a formal setting when speaking about someone of very high status like a company president.
      While お怒りになった is also correct, お怒りになられた adds an extra layer of formality and distance, often used
      when the speaker feels a great deal of deference or awe towards the person.

          about the Prime Minister's intentions.
    scene: Political analysts discussing the Prime Minister's next move.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: volitional (～よう)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: なさろう is the volitional form of なさる, conveying a sense of conjecture about a respected person's
      intentions. It implies respectful speculation, fitting for 'political analysts' discussing the 'Prime
      Minister'. The formal tone is reinforced by the male speaker's use in this context.

        hint: い ない is the plain negative form, but using the honorific いらっしゃらない is more respectful when
          referring to a professor, even in a casual-sounding conditional clause.
    scene: A teaching assistant instructing a student about contacting the professor.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 教授がいらっしゃらないなら uses the plain negative honorific form, which, when combined with
      なら (if), still maintains respect for the professor. This is a practical and polite instruction in
      an academic setting, balancing directness with appropriate deference.
post_example_writeup: Remember to always use these honorific forms when you want to show respect towards
  someone, but never towards yourself. Consider the formality of the situation and the level of respect
  you wish to convey when choosing whether to use お〜になる, なさる, or いらっしゃる. The honorific form elevates the
  action of the subject, showing respect.
