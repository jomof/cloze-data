    "etymology": "「ものなら」 combines 「もの」 (thing) and 「なら」 (if; a conditional form of 「だ」, to be). The 「もの」 adds a sense of possibility or hypothetical consideration, while 「なら」 sets up the conditional relationship.",
    "writeup": "「ものなら」 is used to express a hypothetical situation and the undesirable consequence that would follow. It is often used when the speaker believes the hypothetical situation is unlikely or undesirable. It's like saying, \"If you were to do X (which I hope you don't), then Y (bad thing) would happen.\" It implies a strong warning or caution. It is primarily used in formal settings and speech.",
