    "etymology": "「ものなら」 combines 「もの」 (thing) and 「なら」 (if; a conditional form of 「だ」, to be). The 「もの」 adds a sense of possibility or hypothetical consideration, while 「なら」 sets up the conditional relationship.",
    "writeup": "「ものなら」 is used to express a strong hypothetical situation where taking a particular action (V-volitional) would lead to a definite undesirable or negative consequence. It implies a warning or a strong expectation of a bad outcome. The speaker often believes the hypothetical action is unlikely or unwise. It emphasizes the inevitability of the negative result if the action were to be taken. This pattern carries a nuance of 'If you were to dare to do X, then Y (a bad thing) would happen'. While often used in serious contexts, it can also appear in casual or humorous situations where a strong, almost certain negative outcome is implied.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies a strong, almost inevitable negative consequence and a direct warning from a close friend, which 「ものなら」 conveys more emphatically than a simple 「たら」 conditional."
