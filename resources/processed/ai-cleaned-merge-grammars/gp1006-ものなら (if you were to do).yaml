    "etymology": "「ものなら」 is derived from the noun 「もの」 (thing) and 「なら」, which is the hypothetical form of the auxiliary verb 「だ」 (is). Thus, it literally implies 'if such a thing were to happen'.",
    "writeup": "「ものなら」 combines the noun 「もの」, meaning \"thing,\" with 「なら」, the hypothetical form of 「だ」 (\"is\"). It expresses a hypothetical situation where performing a certain action (often indicated by a verb in the volitional form) would lead to an undesirable outcome. The nuance is that the speaker believes the action is unlikely or impossible, and they are emphasizing the negative consequences if it were to occur. Because of its nuanced and literary tone, it is rarely heard in everyday speech. It is closer to the English expressions such as \"if you were to do...\" or \"should X happen, then Y...\"",
