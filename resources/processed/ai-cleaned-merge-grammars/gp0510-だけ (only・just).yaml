  usage-context: general
etymology: The origin of 「だけ」 is debated, with possibilities including a derivation from 「丈 (take)」, referring
  to length or degree, or from 「竹 (take)」, used metaphorically to indicate a limited quantity. Regardless,
  its function as a limiting particle has been consistent.
writeup: |-
  「だけ」 is a particle used to convey the meaning of "only" or "just," serving to restrict or limit the scope of the preceding word or phrase. It signifies that among various possibilities, only the specified item is true or has been selected.

  It can attach to a wide range of words:
  *   **Nouns**: Directly attaches to a noun to indicate that *only* that noun is involved or relevant.
  *   **Verbs (dictionary form)**: When appended to a verb in its dictionary (plain) form, 「だけ」 limits the action to that specific verb. It can also be used in more complex constructions to mean "as much as one can do something" or "do something to the fullest extent."
  *   **い-Adjectives**: When used with an い-adjective, it emphasizes that the given quality is the sole characteristic. This can sometimes carry a dismissive nuance, suggesting that the quality is present but insufficient or undesirable on its own.
  *   **な-Adjectives**: For な-adjectives, the usage varies. If 「だけ」 follows the stem of a な-adjective (e.g., 「暇だけ」), it often implies that the adjective's core essence is the *only* thing present, potentially with a slightly critical or dismissive tone. When 「だけ」 follows the な-form (e.g., 「暇なだけ」), it typically clarifies that the adjective is the *only* relevant quality in modifying something, providing a reason or explanation that excludes other factors.

  Beyond simple limitation, 「だけ」 also appears in expressions like 「できるだけ」 (as much as possible) or 「VれるだけVる」 (do as much as one can V), indicating an action performed to its maximum capacity or desire. These uses expand its meaning beyond mere restriction to encompass degrees or limits of possibility.
false_friends:
  - term: しか〜ない
    meaning: There is only, nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both limit options, 「しか〜ない」 often carries a nuance of regret, insufficiency, or a lack
      of alternatives, emphasizing what is *not* present. 「だけ」 is more neutral, simply stating what *is*
      present exclusively.
    grammar_point: しか〜ない (only・nothing but)
  - term: ばかり
    meaning: Just, only, nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ばかり」 can imply repetition or an abundance of something, or it can focus exclusively on one
      thing to the neglect of others. Unlike 「だけ」, 「ばかり」 often carries a nuance of 'always doing X' or
      'being full of X'.
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・excessive)
  - term: きり
    meaning: Only, just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「きり」 emphasizes exclusivity or finality, often implying that something is limited to a single
      occurrence or state, and nothing else has happened or will happen since then. It can convey a sense
      of unexpected finality or a slightly stronger, more restrictive limitation than 「だけ」.
    grammar_point: きり (only・since)
  - term: のみ
    meaning: Only
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「のみ」 is a more formal and literary way to express "only" compared to 「だけ」, which is common
      in everyday conversation. While their core meanings are similar, 「のみ」 adds a sense of formality
      or written expression.
    grammar_point: のみ (only・just)
  - term: のみならず
    meaning: Not only… but also
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「のみならず」 is a more formal and emphatic expression for 'not only... but also', often used in
      written Japanese or formal speech. While 「だけ」 can be part of expressions like 「だけでなく」 (not only),
      「のみならず」 functions as a complete conjunction expressing a broader scope of inclusion rather than
      a simple limitation.
    grammar_point: のみならず (not only... but also)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between these limiting expressions, consider their nuanced
  implications. 「だけ」 simply restricts options. 「しか〜ない」 adds a layer of insufficiency or regret. 「ばかり」
  suggests repetition or an exclusive focus, sometimes implying neglect of other things. 「きり」 conveys
  a sense of finality or a singular, unchanging state. Lastly, 「のみ」 functions identically to 「だけ」 but
  in formal or written contexts. 「のみならず」 expands on the 'not only' concept in a formal register. Choosing
  the correct expression depends on the specific nuance you wish to convey.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male

        english: Today, I studied, and haven't played yet.
        hint: Simply using the te-form 「して」 would connect the actions without emphasizing exclusivity.
          The scene requires the nuance that *only* studying has occurred, which 「だけ (only, just)」 provides,
          indicating a limitation on activities.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 勉強 しか し て い ませ ん。
        english: Today, I have only studied.
        hint: 「しか〜ない (only, nothing but)」 emphasizes insufficiency or a lack of options, implying that

          limitation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 勉強 ばかり し て い ます。
        english: Today, I am only studying.

        english: Today, I have only been studying.
        hint: 「きり (only, since)」 often suggests that an action is limited to a single occurrence or that

      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 勉強 する のみ です。
        english: Today, it is only studying.
        hint: 「のみ (only, just)」 is a more formal way to say 'only'. We're looking for the commonly used

      has been exclusively dedicated to studying.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「勉強するだけ」 emphasizes that studying is the sole activity performed so far. The casual
      tone and focus on personal activities are common among younger speakers discussing their day with
      friends. The male casual ending 「ねえよ」 further emphasizes this.

        english: This cake is sweet, and it doesn't have a special flavor.
        hint: Using 「〜て」 merely lists attributes. The scene calls for a nuanced critique where 'sweetness'
          is presented as the *only* characteristic, implying a lack of other desirable qualities. 「だけ
          (only, just)」 conveys this dismissive nuance.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ケーキ は 甘く しか ない です。
        english: This cake is only sweet.
        hint: 「しか〜ない (only, nothing but)」 implies that it's *only* sweet and nothing else, often with
          a negative implication of insufficiency. We're looking for a statement that simply identifies
          'sweet' as the sole quality.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ケーキ は 甘い ばかり です。
        english: This cake is nothing but sweet.
        hint: 「ばかり (only, excessive)」 here could imply it's 'nothing but sweet' or 'full of sweetness,'
          potentially with a critical tone. We're looking for a statement that simply limits the characteristic.
      - competing_japanese:

    scene: A food critic offering a critique of a dessert, implying that its sweetness is its only notable
      quality, and not necessarily a positive one.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of 「甘いだけ」 highlights that 'sweetness' is the exclusive quality, suggesting a lack
      of complexity or other flavors. This critical nuance is appropriate for a formal review by a food
      critic. The polite form 「ません」 maintains the formal register.
  - english: He's just kind; he doesn't have true friends.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 親切 {だけ} で、本当 の 友達 は い ませ ん。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 親切 です が、本当 の 友達 は い ませ ん。
        english: He is kind, but he doesn't have true friends.
        hint: A simple 「〜ですが」 (but) would connect two facts neutrally. The scene implies a critical judgment
          that 'kindness' is his *only* attribute, and it's insufficient for forming deep bonds. 「だけ (only,
          just)」 conveys this dismissive or limiting assessment.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 親切 しか ない です。
        english: He is only kind.
        hint: 「しか〜ない (only, nothing but)」 implies that kindness is the *only* thing he has, often with
          a negative connotation of insufficiency or a lack of other qualities. We're looking for a statement
          that simply limits his primary characteristic.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 親切 ばかり です。
        english: He is nothing but kind.
        hint: 「ばかり (only, excessive)」 can imply that kindness is his dominant or exclusive trait, potentially
          to the point of being one-dimensional. We're looking for a statement that simply limits his
          characteristic.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 親切 な きり です。
        english: He is only kind, that's it.
        hint: 「きり (only, since)」 often suggests a single, unchanging state or that nothing else has happened
          since. We're looking for a simple limiting statement about a characteristic.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 親切 のみ です。
        english: He is only kind (formal).
        hint: 「のみ (only, just)」 is a more formal way to say 'only'. We're looking for the commonly used
          particle.
    scene: Two colleagues discussing a new hire who is outwardly kind but struggles to form genuine connections,
      implying a superficiality.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: By attaching 「だけ」 to the stem 「親切」, the speaker implies that his kindness is his *only* significant
      trait, suggesting a superficiality or a lack of other necessary qualities for genuine friendship.
      This carries a subtly critical tone. The very casual 「いねえよ」 for 'isn't' is typically used by younger
      males.
  - english: The reason he did something like that is just that it's simple.

        english: The reason he did something like that is simply that it's simple.
        hint: Without 「だけ (only, just)」, this would be a simple statement of simplicity. The scene requires
          emphasizing that simplicity is the *sole* reason, clarifying that no other factors are at play.
          「だけ」 conveys this exclusive reason.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が そんな こと を し た の は、単純 しか ない です。
        english: The reason he did something like that is only simplicity.
        hint: 「しか〜ない (only, nothing but)」 implies that simplicity is the *only* explanation, often with
          a nuance of there being no other valid reasons. We're looking for a neutral statement that limits
          the explanation to simplicity.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が そんな こと を し た の は、単純 ばかり です。
        english: The reason he did something like that is nothing but simplicity.
        hint: 「ばかり (only, excessive)」 could imply that it's 'nothing but simple' or 'full of simplicity,'
          potentially emphasizing an oversimplification. We're looking for a statement that simply limits
          the explanation.
      - competing_japanese:

          We're looking for a simple limiting statement about the reason.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が そんな こと を し た の は、ただ 単純 な のみ です。
        english: The reason he did something like that is only simplicity (formal).

      out complex explanations.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The expression 「単純なだけ」 emphasizes that 'simplicity' is the exclusive and complete explanation
      for the action, negating any hidden complexities. The polite form 「です」 maintains a neutral, informative
      tone.

          - たくさん 走っ て、やっと ゴール に 着き まし た。
        english: I ran a lot, and finally reached the goal.
        hint: 「たくさん (many, a lot)」 (a lot) indicates quantity but doesn't convey the sense of reaching
          one's maximum capacity or 'running to the limit.' The scene requires the nuance of pushing physical
          boundaries, which 「走れるだけ走る」 (run as much as one can run) expresses.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最大 限 に 走っ て、やっと ゴール に 着き まし た。
        english: I ran to the maximum extent, and finally reached the goal.
        hint: 「最大限に」 means 'up to its limit,' but it doesn't carry the same sense of the action being
          performed 'as much as one can' specifically using the verb itself. We're looking for the fixed
          expression that repeats the verb.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 精 一杯 走っ て、やっと ゴール に 着き まし た。
        english: I ran with all my might, and finally reached the goal.
        hint: 「精一杯」 means 'with all one's might' or 'to the best of one's ability,' but it focuses on
          the effort rather than the extent of the action being performed to its limit. We're looking
          for the fixed expression that repeats the verb to show utmost extent.
    scene: An exhausted marathon runner describing reaching the finish line after pushing their physical
      limits.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The repetition of the verb in 「走れるだけ走って」 emphasizes the action was performed to the absolute
      maximum capacity. The casual register is appropriate for a personal reflection shared with a peer
      after an strenuous event. 「着いた」 is a casual form of 「着きました」.

        english: This plant grew very much, and it won't get any bigger than this.
        hint: 「とても」 (very) describes the degree of growth but not the idea of reaching an inherent maximum
          or limit. The scene focuses on the plant's natural limit, which 「伸びるだけ伸びる」 (grow as much as
          it will grow) conveys for non-volitional actions.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 植物 は 限界 まで 伸び て、もう これ 以上 は 大きく なり ませ ん。
        english: This plant grew to its limit, and it won't get any bigger than this.
        hint: 「限界まで」 means 'up to its limit,' but it doesn't employ the specific construction of repeating
          the verb to denote the non-volitional action reaching its natural conclusion. We're looking
          for the expression that uses the repeated verb form.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 植物 は 最大 限 に 伸び て、もう これ 以上 は 大きく なり ませ ん。
        english: This plant grew to the maximum extent, and it won't get any bigger than this.
        hint: 「最大限に」 means 'to the maximum extent,' but it lacks the nuance of the action running its
          natural course for a non-volitional verb. We're looking for the specific grammatical pattern
          of repeating the verb.
    scene: A botanist explaining to a curious visitor that a particular plant has reached its maximum
      size and will not grow further.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The usage 「伸びるだけ伸びて」 indicates that the plant has reached its natural maximum growth. The
      polite form 「なりません」 and academic setting make the explanation formal and objective, fitting a botanist's
      informative tone. The repetition of 「伸びる」 emphasizes the completion of growth.

        english: Please complete this report quickly.
        hint: While 「早く」 (quickly) suggests speed, 「できるだけ (as much as possible)」 (as much as possible)
          explicitly conveys the imperative to maximize effort and speed to the fullest extent. The scene's
          urgency aligns with the stronger emphasis of 「できるだけ」.
      - competing_japanese:
          - なるべく 早く、この 報告 書 を 完成 さ せ て 下さい。
        english: As much as possible quickly, please complete this report.
        hint: 「なるべく (as much as possible)」 means 'as much as possible' or 'as soon as possible,' but 「できるだけ」
          literally uses the verb 'to be able to do,' making it a more direct expression of 'as much as
          one *can* do.' We're looking for the phrase that uses the specific form of できる.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 極力 早く、この 報告 書 を 完成 さ せ て 下さい。
        english: To the utmost quickly, please complete this report.
        hint: 「極力」 means 'to the utmost,' emphasizing effort to minimize or maximize something. While
          similar, 「できるだけ」 is a more common and direct expression for 'as much as possible' in this context.
          We're looking for the phrase that uses できる.
    scene: A project manager instructing a team member to prioritize and finish a report quickly, emphasizing
      urgency.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「できるだけ早く」 is a common fixed phrase indicating maximum effort towards speed. The polite imperative
      「完成させて下さい」 is standard in a professional context, where clear and polite instructions are required.
      The phrase 「できるだけ」 conveys a strong request for efficiency.
  - english: I just need a little bit of time.
    japanese:
      - 時間 は 少し {だけ} 必要 です。
      - 時間 は 少し {だけ} 要る よ。
    english_literally: As for time, only a little is necessary.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 時間 は 少し 必要 です。
        english: A little time is necessary.
        hint: Without 「だけ (only, just)」, this would mean 'A little time is necessary' without the specific
          emphasis on *only* a little. The scene requires the nuance that the requested time is minimal,
          which 「少しだけ」 conveys without implying a large burden.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 時間 は わずか です。
        english: Time is merely a little.
        hint: 「わずか (only, a little, meager)」 (a mere, only a few) can emphasize smallness but is more
          formal and less common in this context than 「少しだけ」. We're looking for the natural, common way
          to express 'just a little'.
    scene: A busy person making a small request to buy some time from a colleague or friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of 「少しだけ」 emphasizes that the required time is minimal, perhaps to convey that it
      won't be a burden or inconvenience. The polite 「です」 maintains a respectful tone appropriate for
      a professional setting.
  - english: This is the only thing I can do now.
    japanese:
      - 今、私 に できる の は これ {だけ} です。
      - 今、私 に できる の は これ {だけ} だ。
    english_literally: Now, that which I can do is only this.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今、私 に できる の は これ しか あり ませ ん。
        english: Now, I can only do this.
        hint: 「しか〜ない (only, nothing but)」 emphasizes that there's *nothing else* that can be done, often
          with a nuance of regret or a lack of options. We're looking for a statement that simply limits
          the capability to 'this one thing' without the negative implication.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今、私 に できる の は これ ばかり です。
        english: Now, what I can do is nothing but this.
        hint: 「ばかり (only, excessive)」 can imply an exclusive focus on one thing, potentially suggesting
          that other important things are being neglected. We're looking for a simple statement of limitation.
    scene: Someone feeling helpless or restricted by circumstances, indicating their limited but certain
      capability.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「これだけ」 emphasizes that despite the situation, this specific action or item is the *only* one
      available to them, often implying a sense of resignation or determination within limits. The 「です」
      maintains a neutral, informative tone.
  - english: He just nodded without saying a word.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 何 も 言わ ず に 頷く {だけ} でし た。
      - 彼 は 何 も 言わ ず に 頷い た {だけ} だ。
    english_literally: He was only nodding without saying anything.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 何 も 言わ ず に 頷き まし た。
        english: He nodded without saying anything.
        hint: While simply stating the action, this doesn't emphasize that *only* nodding occurred. The
          scene implies a lack of other expected responses (like speaking), which 「だけ (only, just)」 highlights
          by limiting his action solely to nodding.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 何 も 言わ ず に 頷く ばかり でし た。
        english: He was nothing but nodding without saying anything.
        hint: 「ばかり (only, excessive)」 could imply that he was 'constantly nodding' or 'doing nothing but
          nodding,' perhaps suggesting an excessive or repetitive action. We're looking for a statement
          that simply limits his action to nodding, implying a lack of other actions.
    scene: Someone describing another person's minimal reaction or non-verbal communication in a situation
      where more was expected.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: 「頷くだけ」 emphasizes the singular action of nodding, implying that no other verbal or more substantial
      response was given. This can suggest a lack of engagement, simple agreement, or a deliberate choice
      not to speak. The 「でした」 makes it a polite observation.
post_example_writeup: When 「だけ」 is used with な-adjectives, there is a subtle distinction based on the
  form. If 「だけ」 follows the stem of a な-adjective (e.g., 「暇だけ」, 'just leisure'), it tends to imply that
  the noun's core essence or concept is the only thing present, often with a slightly dismissive or critical
  nuance. For instance, 「彼は暇だけ」 might imply 'He is nothing but idle' or 'All he has is free time.' Conversely,
  when 「だけ」 follows the な-form (e.g., 「暇なだけ」, 'only free (time)'), it emphasizes that the adjective modifies
  something, and this specific quality is the only one relevant to the discussion, as in 「彼が来ないのは暇なだけだ」
  ('The reason he isn't coming is just that he's free/has nothing else to do').
