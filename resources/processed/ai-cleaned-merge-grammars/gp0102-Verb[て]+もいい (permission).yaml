    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てもいい」 breaks down into its components: 「て」, the te-form of the verb, which links actions; 「も」, meaning \"also\" or \"even\"; and 「いい」, meaning \"good.\" So, the phrase literally means \"even if you do [verb], it's good\" or \"it's okay even if you do [verb].\"",
    "writeup": "「Verb[て]+もいい」 is used to express permission or ask for allowance. It indicates that an action is permissible or acceptable. You're essentially saying, \"It's okay if you do [verb]\" or asking \"Is it okay if I do [verb]?\" While omitting the 「も」 is possible in very casual speech, it's generally best to include it, especially when speaking with those you are not close to. Remember that verbs in the te-form may use 「で」 instead of 「て」, depending on the verb.",
