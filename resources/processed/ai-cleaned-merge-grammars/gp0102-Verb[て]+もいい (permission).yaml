    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てもいい」 is formed by combining the te-form of a verb (て), the particle 「も」, and the i-adjective 「いい」. The te-form links actions or states. The particle 「も」 here functions to mean \"even\" or \"also\". The adjective 「いい」 means \"good\" or \"acceptable\". Therefore, the phrase literally translates to \"even if one does (verb), it is good\" or \"it is acceptable even if one does (verb),\" which then conveys the meaning of permission.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「Verb[て]+もいい」 is used to indicate that an action is permissible or acceptable. It translates to \"It's okay to do X,\" \"It's alright to do X,\" or \"You can/may do X.\" When phrased as a question (e.g., 「～てもいいですか」), it is used to ask for permission. This construction literally means \"even if you do [verb], it is good.\" For example, 「座ってもいいですか」 means \"Is it good even if I sit?\" conveying \"May I sit?\" While the 「も」 particle can be omitted for a more casual or direct tone (e.g., 「～ていい」), it is generally advisable to include it, especially when speaking to individuals you do not know well or in situations where politeness is required. This construction applies to all verbs. Remember that some verbs use 「で」 instead of 「て」 for their te-form (e.g., 「飲んで」 from 「飲む」).",
