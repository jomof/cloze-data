id: gp9999
meaning: anything・everything
pronunciation:
  katakana: ナンデモ
  romaji: nandemo
formation:
  何 (なに/なん) + でも: Indicates 'anything' (indiscriminate choice or universality of objects/matters).
  何 (なん) + で + も: Indicates 'everything' (all-encompassing list or totality).
jlpt: N3
etymology: The phrase 何でも combines 何 (nani/nan), meaning "what," and でも (demo), which is a combination
  of the conjunctive particle で and the particle も. 何 is an interrogative pronoun. The particle で can
  indicate means, manner, or state. The particle も signifies inclusion, addition, or even emphasis, often
  translating to "also," "even," or "all." When 何 and でも are combined, the literal sense shifts from "what"
  to "any" or "every." The も emphasizes the "all-inclusiveness" or "indiscriminateness" of 何. This construction
  is parallel to 誰でも (dare-demo) for "anyone/everyone," 何処でも (doko-demo) for "anywhere," and いつでも (itsu-demo)
  for "anytime," where でも acts to generalize the interrogative word. This demonstrates a common pattern
  in Japanese to form indefinite pronouns or adverbial phrases conveying "any" or "every" by appending
  でも to interrogative words.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point {何でも} is a versatile expression in Japanese that generally translates to "anything" or "everything." It is formed by combining the interrogative pronoun 何 (nani/nan) meaning "what" with the particle でも (demo). The でも here functions to generalize the interrogative, implying "even if it's [what]," thereby extending the meaning to include all possibilities.

  There are two primary ways {何でも} is used:

  1.  **"Anything" (indiscriminate choice):** When you want to convey a willingness to accept any option, or that something is not particular about choice.
      *   Example: {何でも} 食べる (to eat anything) – implying you are not picky.
      *   Example: {何でも} いい (anything is fine) – implying you have no preference.

  2.  **"Everything" (all-encompassing):** When you want to express totality, comprehensive knowledge, or that an action applies to all things.
      *   Example: {何でも} 知っている (to know everything) – implying comprehensive knowledge.
      *   Example: {何でも} できる (to be able to do everything) – implying complete capability.

  The nuance of {何でも} depends heavily on the context and the verb it modifies. It often carries a sense of readiness, openness, or a lack of limitation. It can also imply a casualness or a broad acceptance.

  It is typically used in affirmative sentences. While similar structures exist with 何 and negation (e.g., 何も〜ない), those convey "nothing" and are distinct in meaning and usage.
false_friends:
  - term: 誰でも
    meaning: anyone・everyone
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 誰でも is constructed similarly to {何でも} but specifically refers to people, indicating "anyone"
      or "everyone." {何でも} refers to things or matters.
    grammar_point: 誰でも (anyone・everyone)
  - term: 何も〜ない
    meaning: not... anything・nothing
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While it uses 何 and も, 何も〜ない explicitly conveys negation, meaning "not anything" or "nothing,"
      which is the opposite of {何でも}. The も in 何も〜ない functions as a negative polarity item, requiring
      a negative verb.
    grammar_point: 何も〜ない (no reason to・no need to)
  - term: どんなに〜ても
    meaning: no matter how much
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: どんなに〜ても expresses "no matter how much/what kind of," focusing on the degree or type without
      limitation. {何でも} focuses on the thing itself being "anything" or "everything." They both convey
      universality but from different angles.
    grammar_point: どんなに〜ても (no matter how much)
  - term: 何らかの
    meaning: some kind of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 何らかの suggests "some kind of" or "something or other," implying an indefinite but existing
      item. {何でも} means "anything" or "everything," implying either broad inclusion or complete lack of
      specificity.
    grammar_point: 何らかの (some kind of)
post_false_friends_writeup: It's important to distinguish {何でも} from similarly formed expressions. While
  誰でも applies the same "any/every" concept to people, {何でも} is exclusively for things or matters. 何も〜ない
  is a direct opposite, meaning "nothing at all," and requires a negative verb. どんなに〜ても focuses on the
  degree or intensity ("no matter how much"), not the object itself. Finally, 何らかの implies "some kind
  of," suggesting a specific but unknown item, rather than the all-encompassing "anything/everything"
  of {何でも}. Pay close attention to the particles and the verb conjugation to grasp the precise meaning.
