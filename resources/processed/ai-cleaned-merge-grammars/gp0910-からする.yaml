    "etymology": "The structure 「からする」 combines the particle 「から」, indicating a starting point, with the verb 「する」. Literally, it suggests something \"originating from\" a certain value, implying that the actual amount is at least that much or possibly more.",
    "writeup": "「からする」 is a somewhat formal grammar pattern in Japanese, used after a number or counter to indicate a minimum value or starting point from which an estimation is being made. It is generally translated as \"about (A),\" \"(A) or more,\" or \"starting at (A).\" This construction combines the particle 「から」 (from) and the verb 「する」 (to do), suggesting that a quantity or price originates from a certain point, implying an estimation rather than a precise figure.\n\n「からする」 is often employed when the numerical value or amount is substantial, emphasizing that the exact figure is uncertain, but it is certainly no less than the stated amount. It is most frequently encountered when discussing money. Be mindful that using 「からする」 with small numbers can sound unnatural. For referring to measurements such as weight, size, or distance, the similar structure 「からある」 is typically used instead.\n\nAnother related expression is 「からの」, which carries the same meaning as 「からする」. However, 「からの」 must directly precede a noun, making its usage more limited compared to 「からする」. While 「からする」 is predominantly used with monetary values, 「からの」 is often preferred when referring to people or other general quantities.",
