    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is a double negative. 「こと」 refers to a situation or a thing. 「ない」 means 'not exist' or 'not be'. Therefore, 「ないことはない」 literally means 'there isn't a situation where something does not exist', which implies possibility or a qualified affirmation. This structure evolved to allow for nuanced expressions of partial agreement or reluctant possibility.",
    "writeup": "「ないことはない」 is an expression that employs a double negative to convey a weak affirmation. It translates to 'it's not impossible', 'it doesn't mean that it isn't', or 'it is possible, but with reservations'. This structure can be used with the negative form of verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns.\n\nAt its core, the phrase functions as a qualified affirmative. While the literal translation suggests the absence of a negative state, the practical implication is often a reluctant or partial acknowledgment of something. For instance, if someone says 「食べられないことはない」 (taberarenai koto wa nai), it means 'it's not that I *cannot* eat it', implying 'I *can* eat it, but perhaps I don't particularly want to, or it's not my preference.'\n\n**Usage Considerations:**\n*   **Nuance of Hesitation**: The double negative inherently creates a softer, more indirect statement compared to a direct affirmative. It often expresses a lack of enthusiasm, a concession, or a polite refusal.\n*   **Potential Form**: This grammar point frequently appears with verbs in the potential form (e.g., 「できないことはない」). When used this way, it often carries a nuance of 'it's not like I *can't* (do something)', sometimes implying a lack of effort or a half-hearted attitude towards the action.\n*   **Context is Key**: The precise meaning of 「ないことはない」 heavily relies on the context and the speaker's tone. It's crucial to pay attention to the surrounding phrases and the speaker's implied intent.",

            "etymology": "The word 「納豆」 (nattō) is a traditional Japanese food made from fermented soybeans, a staple in many Japanese diets known for its unique smell and sticky texture. 「嫌い」 (kirai) is a な-adjective meaning dislike or hate, commonly used for preferences."

            "etymology": "「間に合う」 (maniau) means to be in time for or to be sufficient. It combines 「間」 (ma), interval, and 「合う」 (au), to fit/match, literally meaning 'to fit the interval'."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The main difference between 「ないことはない」 and similar expressions lies in the degree of affirmation or possibility they convey. 「ないことはない」 expresses a modest affirmation, implying that something is 'possible' but not necessarily highly probable or a preferred option. Expressions like 「というわけではない」 and 「とは限らない」 negate or question something, while 「はずがない」 and 「そうもない」 express impossibility or low probability. When choosing the appropriate expression, consider whether you want to acknowledge possibility (even a slight one) or express a stronger negation or disbelief. 「ないことはない」 is often used to soften a statement, offer a concession, or reluctantly confirm a fact.",
