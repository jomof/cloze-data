    "etymology": "This grammar point is a double negative. 「こと」 refers to a situation or a thing. 「ない」 means 'not exist' or 'not be'. Therefore, 「ないことはない」 means 'there isn't a situation where something does not exist', implying possibility or a qualified affirmation.",
    "writeup": "「ないことはない」 is an expression that uses either the auxiliary verb 「ない」 or the い-adjective 「ない」, depending on the word it modifies. Literally, it can be translated as \"not (A) is not all there is\". However, the common translations are \"(A) is not impossible\" or \"it doesn't mean that it isn't (A)\". This expression can be used with the negative form of any verb, い-adjective, な-adjective, or noun.\n\nBy itself, 「ことはない」 indicates that something is unneeded or never happens. By adding another 「ない」 before 「ことはない」 (e.g., Verb-ない + ことはない), it changes the nuance to \"there is *not* no situation in which (A)\", a double negative expressing that (A) is actually possible.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   「ないことはない」 often appears with verbs in the potential form, implying a lack of effort or half-heartedness towards completing the action. It's similar to saying \"it's not like I can't (A)\" in English.\n*   This grammar point implies some reservation or qualification. It suggests the possibility exists, but it might not be the preferred or easy option.",
