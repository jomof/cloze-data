    "etymology": "This grammar point is a double negative. 「こと」 refers to a situation or a thing. 「ない」 means 'not exist' or 'not be'. Therefore, 「ないことはない」 means 'there isn't a situation where something does not exist', implying possibility or a qualified affirmation.",
    "writeup": "「ないことはない」 is an expression that uses either the auxiliary verb 「ない」 or the い-adjective 「ない」, depending on the word it modifies. It can literally be translated as 'it is not that there is no (A)'. However, common translations are 'it is not impossible (A)', or 'it doesn't mean that it isn't (A)'. This expression can be used with the negative form of any verb, い-adjective, な-adjective, or noun.\n\nBy itself, 「ことはない」 highlights something that is unneeded or never happens. This is partly due to the adverbial particle 「は」 expressing something as being 'complete'. In this way, 'there is no situation in which (A)' is quite an accurate translation of 「ことはない」. By adding 「ない」 to the (A) verb (e.g., Verb-ない + ことはない), all 「ないことはない」 does is simply change this nuance to 'there is -not- no situation in which (A)', a double negative expressing that (A) is actually possible.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「ないことはない」 often appears with verbs in the potential form. This usually implies a lack of effort or feelings of half-heartedness toward the completion of (A). It is similar to 'it's not like I can't (A)' in English.\n*   This grammatical point carries a certain reservation or limitation. It suggests that a possibility exists, but it may not necessarily be the most desirable or easy option.",
