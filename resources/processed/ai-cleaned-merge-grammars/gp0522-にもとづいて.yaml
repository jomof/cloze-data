    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にもとづいて」 comes from the verb 「基づく」 (*motozuku*), meaning \"to be based on.\" It combines 「に」 (a particle indicating location or direction), 「基づく」 (the verb), and 「て」 (the *te*-form, used to connect clauses). Thus, it literally means something along the lines of \"being based on [something], and then...\"",
    "writeup": "The Japanese expression 「にもとづいて」 (*ni motozuite*) is used to state that something is \"based on\" or \"in accordance with\" something else. It signifies that a judgment, decision, action, or creation has a specific foundation or source from which it originates. The core meaning is that of a direct, foundational relationship.\n\nThis grammar point is formed by combining the particle 「に」 (*ni*), the verb 「基づく」 (*motozuku*), and the conjunctive particle 「て」 (*te*). The kanji 「基」 (*moto*) literally means \"foundation\" or \"base,\" which accurately reflects the essence of this expression.\n\nCommon usage patterns include:\n*   **Noun + にもとづいて + [Verb/Sentence]:** This is the most direct form, indicating that the action or statement that follows is based on the preceding noun. For example, 「データ {にもとづいて} 判断する」 (to make a decision based on data).\n*   **Noun + にもとづいた + Noun:** This form is used when the preceding noun modifies a subsequent noun, describing it as \"a [Noun] based on [Noun].\" For example, 「事実 {にもとづいた} 報告」 (a report based on facts).\n\n「にもとづいて」 is typically used in more formal or objective contexts, such as academic papers, business reports, legal documents, or formal discussions where the precise foundation of information or action needs to be clearly stated. It emphasizes a logical and verifiable basis.\n\nWhile 「にもとづいて」 is flexible in its conjugations, it primarily utilizes the `te-form` to connect clauses (e.g., 「にもとづいて」), or the `past plain form` when modifying nouns (e.g., 「にもとづいた」). Other conjugations of the verb 「基づく」 may also be used depending on the specific grammatical context, such as 「にもとづく」 (dictionary form) for general statements or principles, or negative forms like 「にもとづかない」 (not based on).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   This expression implies a solid, often objective, foundation. It is used when the basis is verifiable, a principle, a law, data, or established experience.\n*   It is distinct from expressions that imply merely following instructions or using something as a loose reference point.",
