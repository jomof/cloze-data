    "etymology": "まさか is derived from まさ, meaning \"precise\" or \"exact,\" combined with the adverbial particle か. The か adds a sense of questioning or doubt. So, literally, まさか could be interpreted as \"Is it truly?\" or \"Can it really be?\"",
    "writeup": "まさか is almost always written in hiragana. It combines まさ, a word meaning \"precise\" or \"exact\", with the adverbial particle か. In modern Japanese, まさか functions as a single adverb expressing disbelief or strong surprise, translating to \"it can't be true,\" \"no way,\" or \"don't tell me.\" It typically appears at the beginning of a sentence, setting the stage for a statement that contradicts the speaker's expectations. まさ comes from 正 meaning \"precise\" or \"actual,\" although this noun is rarely used on its own today. まさに is a related adverb meaning \"precisely.\"",
