        "nuance": "Carries a sense of astonishment or a strong conviction that something is unlikely or impossible."
    },
    "etymology": "「まさか」 is derived from 「まさ」, an older noun meaning \"precise\" or \"exact,\" combined with the adverbial particle 「か」, which indicates a question or doubt. The literal sense is akin to \"Is it actually true?\" Over time, its meaning evolved to express strong disbelief or unexpectedness, rather than a literal question of truth.",
    "writeup": "「まさか」 is an adverb expressing intense disbelief, surprise, or a strong conviction that something is impossible. It is almost always written purely in hiragana, despite its etymological roots in kanji. While its literal origins hint at a question of truth, in modern Japanese, 「まさか」 functions as a single adverb conveying sentiments such as \"no way,\" \"I can't believe it,\" or \"don't tell me.\"\n\nAs an adverb, 「まさか」 most commonly appears at the beginning of a sentence, setting the tone for the speaker's shock or astonishment about what follows. It can be used both to express personal surprise about an unexpected event or to refute a claim with strong incredulity.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Placement:** Typically precedes the statement of disbelief. For example, 「まさか、彼がそんなことをするなんて」 (No way, he would do such a thing!).\n*   **Associated Phrases:** It often pairs with expressions of thought or certainty, such as 「〜とは思わなかった」 (I didn't think that...) or 「〜はずがない」 (There's no way that...).\n*   **Nuance with 「か」:** While the 「か」 particle typically forms questions, in 「まさか」, it contributes to the sense of rhetorical disbelief or an implied question of possibility, rather than a direct inquiry.",

            "nuance": "「よもや」 is generally more formal or literary than 「まさか」 and conveys an even stronger sense of impossibility or remote likelihood, often followed by a negative expression. While 「まさか」 can stand alone as an exclamation, 「よもや」 typically requires a follow-up clause."

            "nuance": "「ありえない」 is a more direct and stronger declaration of impossibility, focusing on the factual inability of something to occur. While 「まさか」 expresses personal disbelief or surprise, 「ありえない」 states that something simply 'cannot be' or 'is out of the question'."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「まさか」 and 「よもや」 express disbelief or unexpectedness, 「まさか」 is more common in everyday speech and can function as a standalone interjection. 「よもや」, on the other hand, carries a more literary or formal tone and is almost always followed by a negative clause, emphasizing an even greater degree of unlikelihood. Similarly, 「ありえない」 and 「信じられない」 convey impossibility and incredulity, respectively, but lack the pre-emptive, anticipatory shock that 「まさか」 often introduces.",
