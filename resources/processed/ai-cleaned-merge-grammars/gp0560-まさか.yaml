        "nuance": "Carries a sense of astonishment or a strong conviction that something is unlikely or impossible."
    },
    "etymology": "「まさか」 is derived from 「まさ」, an older noun meaning \"precise\" or \"exact,\" combined with the adverbial particle 「か」, which indicates a question or doubt. The literal sense is akin to \"Is it actually true?\" Over time, its meaning evolved to express strong disbelief or unexpectedness, rather than a literal question of truth.",
    "writeup": "「まさか」 is an adverb expressing intense disbelief, surprise, or a strong conviction that something is impossible. It is almost always written purely in hiragana, despite its etymological roots in kanji. While its literal origins hint at a question of truth, in modern Japanese, 「まさか」 functions as a single adverb conveying sentiments such as \"no way,\" \"I can't believe it,\" or \"don't tell me.\"\n\nAs an adverb, 「まさか」 most commonly appears at the beginning of a sentence, setting the tone for the speaker's shock or astonishment about what follows. It can be used both to express personal surprise about an unexpected event or to refute a claim with strong incredulity.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Placement:** Typically precedes the statement of disbelief. For example, 「まさか、彼がそんなことをするなんて」 (No way, he would do such a thing!).\n*   **Associated Phrases:** It often pairs with expressions of thought or certainty, such as 「〜とは思わなかった」 (I didn't think that...) or 「〜はずがない」 (There's no way that...).\n*   **Nuance with 「か」:** While the 「か」 particle typically forms questions, in 「まさか」, it contributes to the sense of rhetorical disbelief or an implied question of possibility, rather than a direct inquiry.",
