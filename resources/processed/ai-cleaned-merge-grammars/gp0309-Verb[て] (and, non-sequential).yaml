    "etymology": "The particle 「て」 originally derives from the conjunctive particle 「而 (して)」 in classical Japanese, which was used to connect clauses. Over time, it evolved into the 「て」-form, serving various functions, including connecting clauses in a non-sequential manner, indicating reasons, or providing a sequence of actions.",
    "writeup": "The 「て」-form of a verb, adjective, or noun can connect two independent clauses, indicating a variety of relationships between the actions or states described. These relationships can be non-sequential events, contrasts (similar to the contrastive use of 「は」), or parallel actions/states. It's crucial to consider whether the events happen one after the other or if they simply describe '(A), and (B)'.\n\nSometimes, this usage of 「て」 is translated as \"while (A), also (B).\" The key difference between this and other \"while\" or \"but\" grammar points (like 「けど」, 「のに」, or 「だが」) is that both (A) and (B) have equal weight and importance. These other grammar points usually imply that either (A) or (B) is more important.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike Verb[て] used for non-sequential events, 「てもいい」 expresses permission to do something. It uses the て-form but attaches a different meaning through the addition of 「もいい」."

            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "Unlike Verb[て] in this context, 「てから」 explicitly indicates a sequential action where A happens, and then B happens. This grammar point specifically highlights non-sequential or simultaneous relationships."

        {
            "term": "そして",
            "meaning": "And; then; and then",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「そして」 primarily indicates a sequence of events or adds another item to a list, often with a stronger emphasis on the transition. The 「て」 form, in contrast, can connect actions/states that are concurrent, parallel, or simply presented as facts without a strong sequential implication."
        },

            "meaning": "But; although",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「けど」 is a conjunction that introduces a contrast or a concession, often implying that the second clause offers a slightly conflicting or surprising element. While 「て」 can show contrast, it typically presents two facts with equal weight, without necessarily highlighting a strong contradiction."

            "nuance": "「それに」 adds further information or another item to a list, similar to 'and' or 'moreover' in English. The 「て」 form can also connect additional information, but 「それに」 tends to emphasize the additive nature more explicitly, often introducing a separate, reinforcing point."

            "term": "それから",
            "meaning": "And then; after that; since then",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「それから」 clearly marks a temporal sequence of events or a transition to the next topic. The 「て」 form, while sometimes indicating sequence, is broader and can connect non-sequential, parallel, or descriptive clauses. 「それから」 places a stronger emphasis on the passage of time or the order of listing."

            "term": "一方",
            "meaning": "On the other hand; meanwhile",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「一方」 (いっぽう) is a more formal expression used to introduce a contrasting or parallel situation, often when comparing two distinct subjects or aspects. The 「て」 form offers a more natural and less formal way to simply state two concurrent or contrasting facts without explicitly drawing a comparison."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "It's important to distinguish the non-sequential 「て」 from other uses of the 「て」-form and similar conjunctions. For example, 「てもいい」 indicates permission, while 「てから」 indicates a strict sequence of actions. Conjunctions like 「そして」, 「けど」, 「それに」, 「それから」, and 「一方」 also connect clauses, but they each carry specific nuances of sequence, contrast, or addition that differ from the balanced, non-sequential nature of this 「て」 form. Pay attention to the context and the precise relationship between clauses to choose the appropriate expression.",
