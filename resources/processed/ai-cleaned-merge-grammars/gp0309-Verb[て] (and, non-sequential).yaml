    "etymology": "The particle 「て」 originally derives from the conjunctive particle 「而 (して)」 in classical Japanese, which was used to connect clauses. Over time, it evolved into the 「て」-form, serving various functions, including connecting clauses in a non-sequential manner, indicating reasons, or providing a sequence of actions.",
    "writeup": "The 「て」-form of a verb can connect two independent clauses, indicating a variety of relationships between the actions or states described. These relationships can be non-sequential events, contrasts (similar to the contrastive use of 「は」), or parallel actions/states. It's crucial to consider whether the events happen one after the other or if they simply describe '(A), and (B)'.\n\nSometimes, this usage of 「て」 is translated as \"while (A), also (B).\" The key difference between this and other \"while\" or \"but\" grammar points (like 「けど」, 「のに」, or 「だが」) is that both (A) and (B) have equal weight and importance. These other grammar points usually imply that either (A) or (B) is more important.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene focuses on simply stating facts about their routines without emphasizing the contrast, which aligns with the non-sequential, equally weighted 「て」 form. 「けど」 would introduce a stronger sense of contradiction."
