jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  function: Adds additional information that builds upon the preceding statement, often with a sense of
    surprise or emphasizing that the additional information is even more remarkable or unexpected.
  nuance: Implies that something is not just limited to the preceding statement, but also extends to something
    else, often something unexpected, more extreme, or even negative.
etymology: The term combines 'ばかり' (bakari), which originally meant 'only' or 'just,' with 'か' (ka), a
  question particle that can imply 'isn't it?' or a sense of doubt/further inquiry. This combination evolved
  to convey the nuance of 'not only X, but (is it not the case that) also Y?' thereby creating the sense
  of 'not only... but also,' often with an emphasis on the surprising or additional aspect of Y.
writeup: The grammar point `ばかりか` is used to express that something is "not only... but also..." a certain
  way. It introduces additional information that builds upon or extends the preceding statement. This
  extension often comes with a nuance of surprise, amplification, or emphasis, suggesting that the additional
  information is even more significant, unexpected, or goes beyond what might be initially inferred. While
  `ばかりか` is similar to `～だけでなく`, it often carries a stronger sense of 'moreover' or 'what's more,' particularly
  when the second clause presents a surprising or negatively escalating situation. It can be used with
  plain forms of verbs, adjectives, and nouns. For nouns and な-adjectives, `な` is typically inserted before
  `ばかりか`.
false_friends:
  - term: ～だけでなく
    meaning: not only... but also
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～だけでなく」is more neutral and simply lists two facts or actions without necessarily implying
      surprise or special emphasis on the second clause. 「ばかりか」often carries a stronger nuance of unexpectedness
      or amplification for the second clause.
    grammar_point: 〜ばかりでなく・〜だけでなく (not only... but also)
  - term: その上
    meaning: in addition, moreover
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「その上」simply adds another piece of information to the previous statement. It lacks the implied
      emphasis or 'even more' nuance that 「ばかりか」conveys, which highlights an additional, often surprising,
      aspect.
    grammar_point: その上 (in addition)
  - term: ～に加えて
    meaning: in addition to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～に加えて」functions as a straightforward additive, listing items or facts without the implied
      emphasis or unexpectedness often present with 「ばかりか」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:に加えて (in addition to)
  - term: ～ばかりでなく
    meaning: not only... but also
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While grammatically similar, 「～ばかりでなく」tends to be less formal and direct than 「ばかりか」. The
      nuance of surprise or exceeding expectations is less pronounced, and 「ばかりか」can also imply a negative
      escalation.
    grammar_point: 〜ばかりでなく・〜だけでなく (not only... but also)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'While these expressions all convey a sense of adding information, `ばかりか`
  distinguishes itself by often carrying a stronger implication of the second piece of information being
  unexpected, more extreme, or surprising. Think of it as: ''Not only X, but even Y (which might be surprising
  or a step further).'' Other expressions are more neutral in their additive function.'

          - その 問題 は 難しかっ た だけ で なく、時間 も かかっ た。
        english: The problem was not only difficult, but it also took a lot of time.
        hint: While similar in meaning, 「ばかりか」can imply a stronger or more surprising additional factor.
          We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes the 'moreover' aspect, suggesting the time consumption
          was an unexpected extra burden.

        english: He is an excellent student, and moreover, he is also a wonderful athlete.
        hint: 「その上」simply adds information. 「ばかりか」highlights that his athletic ability is an additional,
          perhaps surprising, quality beyond just being an excellent student. We're looking for a phrase
          that suggests more than just a simple addition.
    scene: Two teachers are discussing a highly gifted student who excels in multiple areas.

        english: This dish is delicious, and it's also healthy.
        hint: 「し～し」lists reasons or characteristics without the same emphasis on the second point. 「ばかりか」emphasizes
          that healthiness is an added, perhaps unexpected, benefit beyond just being delicious. We're
          looking for an emphasis on the 'even more' aspect.

          - あの 建物 は 大きい だけ に、とても 古い。
        english: Because that building is big, it is very old.
        hint: The hint suggests a causal relationship, but we are looking for a grammar point that simply
          adds another characteristic without implying cause. 「ばかりか」connects two attributes, emphasizing
          that the second is also true, perhaps surprisingly so.

        english: She didn't apologize, and on top of that, she started yelling.
        hint: 「上に」is an additive. 「ばかりか」is more suitable here to convey a sense of negative escalation
          or surprise that the situation worsened so much. We're looking for a phrase that implies the
          second action was even worse or more unexpected.
    scene: Two coworkers are gossiping about a particularly difficult colleague and her recent outburst.

        english: Even though the rain didn't stop, it became stronger and stronger.
        hint: 「のに」expresses a contrast or unexpected outcome for the first part. We are looking for a
          grammar point that emphasizes an additional, escalating negative situation from the initial
          state. 「ばかりか」highlights the further negative development.

        english: He finished the work quickly, and furthermore, he completed it perfectly.
        hint: 「さらに」simply adds another positive point. 「ばかりか」implies that the perfect completion was an
          unexpected bonus or even more impressive than just the speed. We're looking for a phrase that
          emphasizes exceeding expectations.

        english: Because his words lacked sincerity, they deeply hurt her feelings.
        hint: The hint suggests a cause-and-effect. We're looking for a grammar point that highlights
          two negative aspects, where the second is an additional, possibly more severe, consequence,
          rather than just a direct result. 「ばかりか」connects two negative points, implying the second adds
          to the severity.

        hint: 「し～し」lists multiple effects. 「ばかりか」is used here to emphasize that causing casualties was
          a significantly more severe outcome than just property damage. We're looking for a grammar point
          that highlights the additional, grave impact.

        english: This smartphone is expensive. Moreover, its battery life is also terrible.
        hint: 「しかも」adds a further point, often with a similar tone. 「ばかりか」here emphasizes that the terrible
          battery life is an additional, perhaps surprising or frustrating, drawback beyond the high cost.
          We're looking for a phrase that implies an 'on top of that' negative aspect.

        english: As expected, the customer praised our service, and also bought more products.
        hint: The hint implies 'as expected,' but the focus here is on a surprising or additional positive
          action from the customer beyond just praise. We're looking for a phrase that connects two positive
          actions, with the second being an unexpected bonus.
    scene: A sales team is celebrating a successful interaction with a client.

post_example_writeup: As illustrated by these examples, `ばかりか` can connect various types of clauses and
  sentences, highlighting that the situation extends beyond the initial statement, often in a way that
  is surprising, an escalation (positive or negative), or simply a significant additional point.
