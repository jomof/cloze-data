    "etymology": "This grammar point combines にする (to decide on, to go with) or とする (to consider as), the past tense marker た, the noun ところ (place, point, situation), and the particle で (at, in). The underlying idea is 'even if we consider the situation to be X,' leading to the nuance of 'even for X, the result is the same/negative'. It can be seen as an extension of the '〜たところで' structure, which already conveys 'even if (A), not (B)' with a negative outcome.",
    "writeup": "「にしたところで」, and its close variant 「としたところで」, are expressions used to convey that even if a certain condition or situation (A) is true, the ultimate result (B) will not change. This structure frequently implies a sense of powerlessness regarding the outcome, or that there is no significant difference between the specified situation and any other potential choice. It is commonly translated as \"even in the case of (A), (B)\" or \"even for (A), (B)\". This pattern can be thought of more simply as a combination of にする 'going with (A)' or とする 'as (A)', and the たところで 'even if (A), not (B)' grammar structure that indicates negative outcomes.\n\nThis grammar point attaches directly to nouns or noun-modified phrases. It is formed by combining either the case-marking particle 「に」 or 「と」 with the past tense of 「する」 (「した」), followed by the noun 「ところ」 (which in this context denotes a situation or point), and finally the particle 「で」. You can think of it as an extension of 「〜たところで」, a structure that already emphasizes a negative or unchanged outcome even when a specific condition is met. In more casual conversations, 「たところで」 can sometimes be replaced with 「たって」, leading to the forms 「にしたって」 and 「としたって」. These casual forms carry the same core meaning of futility or an unchangeable outcome, but are used in less formal contexts and may convey a stronger sense of personal resignation or frustration.",

            "nuance": "「にしたところで」 emphasizes the futility of a situation, implying that even if a specific condition is met, the outcome won't change. In contrast, 「にしてからが」 highlights that a situation is already true from a certain point of view, or that even that particular person or thing exhibits a certain quality, often setting a baseline for an argument."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Both 「にしたところで」 and 「にしてからが」 can carry the nuance of 'even for (X)'. However, their specific implications differ. 「にしたところで」 emphasizes that even when considering a particular person or situation, the outcome remains unchanged, or there are inherent limitations. This often conveys a sense of resignation or powerlessness, particularly when applied to entities that might otherwise be expected to have greater influence or ability. Conversely, 「にしてからが」 is used to establish a certain person or thing as a baseline or starting point, indicating that even *they* exhibit a particular quality or fall under a certain condition. For instance, 「天才に{したところで}」 would suggest 'even a genius has limits,' while 「天才に{してからが}」 might imply 'even using a genius as a benchmark, the problem remains difficult.'",
