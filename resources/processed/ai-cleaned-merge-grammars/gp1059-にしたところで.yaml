    "etymology": "This grammar point combines にする (to decide on, to go with), the past tense marker た, the noun ところ (place, point, situation), and the particle で (at, in). The underlying idea is 'even if we consider the situation to be X'.",
    "writeup": "「にしたところで」 (or 「としたところで」) indicates that even if a certain condition or situation (A) is true, the result (B) will not change. It often conveys a sense of powerlessness or that there's no significant difference between the given situation and any other possibility. Common translations include \"even in the case of (A), (B)\" or \"even for (A), (B)\".\n\n*   It combines either the case-marking particles 「と」 or 「に」 with the past tense of 「する」 (「した」), the noun 「ところ」 (used for marking the situation), and the case marking particle 「で」.\n*   It directly follows nouns or noun-modified phrases.\n*   In casual situations, 「たところで」 will occasionally be replaced with 「たって」.",
