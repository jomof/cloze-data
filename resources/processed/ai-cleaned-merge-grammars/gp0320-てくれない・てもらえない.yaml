    "etymology": "「てくれる」indicates someone doing something for the speaker's benefit. 「てもらう」indicates receiving the favor of someone doing something. The negative forms, 「てくれない」 and 「てもらえない」, turn these into requests by implying a question of whether the other person will grant that favor. Note that 「くれる」is from the giver's perspective, and 「もらう」is from the receiver's perspective.",
    "writeup": "When used in the negative, 「てくれない」 (coming from 「てくれる」) and 「てもらえない」 (coming from 「てもらえる」) function similarly to the negative question form of 「じゃないか」. They're essentially polite requests. 「てくれない」 roughly translates to \"Would you not do (A) for me?\" while 「てもらえない」 is more like \"Could I not have you do (A) for me?\" In both constructions, the question particle 「か」 may be omitted, though its inclusion often softens the tone slightly.\n\nHere's a rough scale of politeness:\n\n1.  「てくれ」\n2.  「てくれる」\n3.  「てもらえる」\n4.  「てくれない(か)」\n5.  「てもらえない(か)」\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   While the above list suggests 「てくれ」 is the most direct, it's often considered quite rude and should be avoided in most situations, especially with people who are not close friends or family.\n*   Remember to use a rising intonation when speaking these phrases to indicate a question.",
