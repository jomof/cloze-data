    "etymology": "「てくれる」 comes from the verb 「くれる」 (kureru), meaning 'to give'. 「てもらう」 comes from the verb 「もらう」 (morau), meaning 'to receive'. The 'te' form of the verb indicates an action being done, so 'te kureru' is literally someone 'giving' you the action, and 'te morau' is you 'receiving' the action. The negative forms are used as requests, softening the directness of asking for something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar points **てくれない** (from **てくれる**) and **てもらえない** (from **てもらう**) are used to make requests or ask for favors. While seemingly negative in form (～ない), they function as polite or indirect questions, effectively asking, \"Won't you do X for me?\" or \"Could you do X for me?\".\n\nThe nuance of these expressions comes from the verbs **くれる** (to give, implying an action done for the speaker's benefit) and **もらう** (to receive, implying the speaker receives an action). When combined with the te-form and negated, they soften the directness of a request.\n\n*   **てくれない**: This form is generally used for more casual requests to people you are familiar with, such as friends or family. It means \"Won't you do X for me?\".\n*   **てもらえない**: This form is slightly more polite than **てくれない** and is suitable for requests to acquaintances or in situations where a bit more deference is appropriate. It can be understood as \"Couldn't I receive the favor of you doing X?\".\n\nBoth forms can optionally be followed by the question particle **か** (**てくれないか**, **てもらえないか**). Adding **か** further softens the request, making it sound even more polite and less demanding. Omitting **か** often makes the request feel more direct, though still softer than a plain imperative.\n\n**Politeness Scale (from least to most direct/rude to most polite):**\n1.  **てくれ**: This is a direct, strong command and can be considered rude, especially when addressing superiors or elders. It should be avoided in most social situations.\n2.  **てくれる**: A simple affirmative statement, \"They do X for me,\" not a request.\n3.  **てもらう**: A simple affirmative statement, \"I receive the favor of X,\" not a request.\n4.  **てくれない**: Casual request.\n5.  **てもらえない**: More polite request.\n6.  **てくれないか**: Softer casual request.\n7.  **てもらえないか**: Softer polite request.\n\nIt is important to remember that these forms are requests, and their effectiveness relies on a rising intonation at the end, signaling a question. They are particularly useful when you want to ask someone for something without being overly demanding or direct.",
