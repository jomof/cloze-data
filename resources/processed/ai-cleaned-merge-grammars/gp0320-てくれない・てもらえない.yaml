    "writeup": "The grammar points 「てくれない」 (from 「てくれる」) and 「てもらえない」 (from 「てもらえる」) are used to ask for a favor. They function similarly to the negative question form 「～じゃないか」. Essentially, you're asking \"Won't you do (A) for me?\" or \"Couldn't I have you do (A) for me?\" 「か」 (the question particle) is often omitted in casual speech.\n\nHere's a rough scale of politeness, from least to most: 「てくれ」, 「てくれる」, 「てもらえる」, 「てくれない(か)」, 「てもらえない(か)」.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   「てくれ」 can be considered rude and should generally be avoided, especially with those older than you, or above you in social standing.\n*   Remember to use a rising intonation when speaking these phrases as they are questions.\n*   This grammar point is most often used with family or friends.",

    "post_example_writeup": "It is important to note that 「てくれない」 and 「てもらえない」 are primarily used to ask for small favors or requests. For more significant or formal requests, other grammar structures may be more appropriate.",
    "etymology": "「てくれる」 comes from the verb 「くれる」 (kureru), meaning 'to give'. 「てもらう」 comes from the verb 「もらう」 (morau), meaning 'to receive'. The 'te' form of the verb indicates an action being done, so 'te kureru' is literally someone 'giving' you the action, and 'te morau' is you 'receiving' the action. The negative forms are used as requests, softening the directness of asking for something.",
