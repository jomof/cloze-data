jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used by superiors/elders to subordinates/younger people, or in general a gentle, encouraging
    tone. Cannot be used for one's own actions
  function: To make a polite suggestion or a light command.
  nuance: Implies a softer, more invitational tone compared to direct commands like なさい, often with an
    underlying meaning of 'try as you like, when it suits you'
etymology: 「ごらん (御覧)」is the polite imperative form of the verb 「見る (miru)」, meaning "to see" or "to look."
  When attached to the -te form of another verb, it creates a polite suggestion or command to try doing
  something. The honorific prefix 「御 (go)」 combined with 「覧 (ran)」, derived from 「見る」, emphasizes the
  respectful nature of the suggestion.
writeup: 「てごらん」 is a polite Japanese expression used to make a gentle suggestion or a light command, similar
  to 「なさい」 but often softer. It is frequently translated as "please try to (A)" or "please look at (A)",
  where (A) is the verb connected to 「ごらん」 using the 「て」 form. While often translated as "please try",
  the literal meaning of 「ごらん」 comes from "to look" or "to peruse." This gives 「てごらん」 a nuance of "I recommend
  you try this," or "you should look at this," making it similar to 「てみる」 ("to try") but with an added
  invitational quality. It is often used with children. **Important Considerations:** Since 「ごらん」 inherently
  carries an honorific and suggestive tone, it **cannot** be used to refer to your own actions. It is
  exclusively used to suggest actions to other people. Occasionally, 「ごらん」 and 「なさい」 are combined to form
  「ごらんなさい」. This combination slightly strengthens the suggestion, giving it the feel of a very light command.
  Due to this increased directness, 「ごらんなさい」 is primarily used by superiors or elders when requesting
  something of a subordinate or younger person. It retains a polite tone but is more assertive than 「てごらん」
  alone.

  - term: な
    meaning: Don't (Prohibitive)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「てごらん」 which suggests or encourages an action, 「な」 directly prohibits it.
    grammar_point: な (prohibitive particle)
  - term: ないでください
    meaning: Please don't (Polite request)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「てごらん」 which encourages an action, 「ないでください」 politely asks someone not to do something.
    grammar_point: ないでください・ないで (please don't)
  - term: てください
    meaning: Please do (Polite request)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both are polite requests, 「てごらん」 carries a slightly more casual and suggestive tone,
      often implying a benefit to the listener, whereas 「てください」 is a more direct and neutral request.
    grammar_point: てください (polite request)
  - term: なさい
    meaning: Command to do
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Both express a suggestion or command. 「てごらん」 is generally softer and more invitational, implying
      a benefit or a gentle test. 「なさい」 is more direct and can sound more authoritative, especially from
      someone in a superior position.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]なさい (polite imperative)'
  - term: てみる
    meaning: To try to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てみる」 is used to express the speaker's own intention to 'try' something or the general act
      of trying. In contrast, 「てごらん」 is exclusively used when inviting or suggesting *someone else* to
      try or do something.
    grammar_point: てみる (try and see)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「てごらん」 is used to suggest someone else try
  something or look at something, often with a gentle, encouraging tone. 「てください」 is a standard polite
  request. 「てみる」 describes the act of trying something, typically by the speaker themselves. Lastly, 「なさい」
  is a more direct command, often used by superiors to subordinates.
