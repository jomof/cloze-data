  part-of-speech: phrase
  usage-context: Indicates that something is easily recognized or understood simply by looking at it,
    applicable in both formal and informal settings.
  nuance: Emphasizes that the recognition is based purely on visual information
etymology: The phrase 「見るからに」 is derived from the verb 「見る」 (miru, to see) combined with 「から」 (kara, from)
  and 「に」 (ni, a particle indicating reason or cause). It literally translates to "from seeing," indicating
  that the judgment is based on visual observation.
writeup: "**見るからに** (miru kara ni) is a versatile phrase used to express that something is **visibly obvious**\
  \ or **easily recognizable** simply by looking at it. It strongly emphasizes that the judgment or impression\
  \ formed is based purely on **visual cues** or **outward appearance**, often leaving little room for\
  \ doubt. It conveys the sense of \"you can tell just by looking,\" \"visibly,\" or \"obviously.\" This\
  \ expression is commonly used in everyday conversation and is gender and age-neutral. The register can\
  \ vary from casual to polite depending on the context and the accompanying sentence-final particles.\
  \ \n\nThe phrase typically precedes:\n*   **い-adjectives in their `そうだ` form**: This indicates that\
  \ something *looks* or *appears* to be a certain way, such as delicious (おいしそうだ) or interesting (面白そうだ).\n\
  *   **な-adjectives (often followed by `だ` or `に見える`)**: This implies that a person or thing *is* obviously\
  \ of a certain quality or identity. For example, a person might **見るからに** 聡明だ (be obviously intelligent),\
  \ or a situation might **見るからに** 困難そうに見える (visibly appear difficult).\n*   **Nouns (followed by `だ`\
  \ or `に見える`)**: This signifies that a person or thing *is* obviously of a certain type or role, recognized\
  \ immediately by their appearance.\n*   **Verbs in their `ている` form**: This indicates that someone is\
  \ visibly in the act of doing something or in a particular state, such as hiding something (隠している)."

      hearsay, or inference. In contrast, 「見るからに」 restricts the source of the conclusion strictly to visual
      evidence.
    grammar_point: ようだ (it seems)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「見るからに」 is specifically about visual impressions, whereas 「明らかに」 can be based
  on any kind of evidence, and 「いかにも」 conveys something being very typical or characteristic. Furthermore,
  while 「そう」 and 「ようだ」 indicate general appearances or conjectures, 「見るからに」 specifies that the impression
  is derived *purely* from visual observation.

      make it clear they are being dishonest.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: This example uses 「見るからに」 with the verb (ている form) 「隠している」 (hiding), indicating that the friend's
      secretive behavior and uneasy demeanor were immediately evident through visual cues, making it obvious
      they were concealing something. In casual conversation between female and male friends, such direct
      observations are common. The phrasing doesn't use gender-specific particles, making it neutral in
      that regard, but the situation implies an informal setting between peers where such observations
      can be openly shared without offense, particularly when there's an existing level of trust or concern.
      The choice of 「隠しているようだった」 or 「隠しているように見えました」 adds a slight softening or less direct assertion,
      often typical in Japanese even in casual settings to avoid sounding overly accusatory, though the
      implication is clear. The nuance is in the directness of visual evidence being the sole basis of
      the conclusion, as reinforced by 「見るからに」 and the following explanation of body language and eye
      contact.
