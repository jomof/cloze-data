jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  function: Expresses that an action was performed, and the resulting state was left as is, often implying
    neglect, carelessness, or an undesirable outcome.
  nuance: This expression often carries a nuance of neglect, carelessness, or incompleteness, leading
    to an undesirable or inconvenient state. While it can be used descriptively, its most common usage
    implies a negative judgment about the state being left.
  colocation: Commonly collocates with verbs related to leaving things on (e.g., electrical appliances),
    leaving things open, or leaving things in disarray.
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially or as part of a compound predicate, modifying the verb's state.
  temporal-flow: Describes a resultant state that persists from a past action into the present, often
    with an implication of continued neglect.
etymology: The grammatical pattern 「～っぱなし」 derives from the verb 「放す (hanasu)」, meaning "to release,"
  "to let go," or "to set free." The initial 「っ」 (small tsu) indicates a geminate consonant, turning 「はなす
  (hanasu)」 into 「っぱなし (ppanashi)」, a common phonological phenomenon in Japanese. Fundamentally, it conveys
  the idea of an action being completed and the resulting state being left "as is" or "released." Over
  time, this evolved to often imply a state of neglect or an action left incomplete, thereby acquiring
  its common negative connotation of leaving something unattended or in an undesirable condition.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern 「～っぱなし」 is used to describe a state where an action has been performed, and the resulting situation or object is left as it is, often implying a sense of carelessness, neglect, or incompletion. While it can be used descriptively, its most prevalent use carries a negative nuance, suggesting that something was left undone, in disarray, or in an undesirable manner.

  For instance, if you leave the television on and walk away, you could say 「テレビをつけっぱなし」, highlighting that the TV was left on and is now unattended. This often implies a subtle disapproval or a hint of annoyance. Similarly, if someone leaves their shoes scattered around, you might hear 「靴を出しっぱなし」.

  While the core meaning is simply "leaving something as is," the implied context usually infers that it's a state that should not have been left in that way, or that it causes inconvenience. For example, leaving a door open and walking out 「ドアを開けっぱなし」 can be problematic for security or climate control.

  It attaches to the stem of a verb. For example, from 「つける (tsukeru)」 (to turn on), you get 「つけっぱなし (tsukeppanashi)」. From 「開ける (akeru)」 (to open), you get 「開けっぱなし (akeppanashi)」. It's a very common expression in everyday Japanese conversations, especially when expressing minor complaints or observations about tidiness and responsibility.

  - term: まま (as is)
    meaning: Remaining in a state; as is.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「～っぱなし」, 「～まま」 is a neutral expression. It simply describes a state of something being
      left as it is, without inherently implying carelessness, neglect, or a negative outcome. It can
      be used for both positive, negative, or neutral situations.
    grammar_point: まま (as is)
  - term: てある (resultant state)
    meaning: Something is done and left in that state (often implying preparation or purpose).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「～てある」 also describes a resultant state, it often implies that the action was done with
      a purpose or as a preparation, and the state is maintained for some reason. 「～っぱなし」 implies neglect
      or an undesirable state.
    grammar_point: てある (resultant state)
  - term: きり (only・since)
    meaning: Only; just; since (implies a state that has not changed since a particular action or time).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～きり」 can describe a state that has been left, but it emphasizes the exclusivity or continuity
      since a certain point, rather than the negligence or undesirable nature of the state itself, as
      「～っぱなし」 does.
    grammar_point: きり (only・since)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'While 「～っぱなし」, 「～まま」, 「～てある」, and 「～きり」 can all describe a state where something
  is left as it is, the critical difference lies in the nuance and implied intent. 「～っぱなし」 strongly suggests
  carelessness or neglect, often leading to a negative or inconvenient outcome. For example, 「電気をつけっぱなしだ」
  means the light was left on carelessly. In contrast, 「～まま」 is neutral, simply stating that something
  remains in a certain state, whether intentional or not, like 「靴を履いたまま」 (with shoes on). 「～てある」 implies
  that an action was done for a purpose and the resulting state is maintained, as in 「窓が開けてある」 (the window
  was opened and left open for a reason, e.g., ventilation). Lastly, 「～きり」 emphasizes exclusivity or continuity
  from a specific point, often meaning "only that one thing" or "since then," not necessarily implying
  neglect, such as 「彼が部屋を出たきり、誰も見ていない」 (No one has seen him since he left the room). Remember: 「～っぱなし」
  usually hints at a problem or complaint.'

          - 弟 が 電気 を つけ た まま に し て い た。
        english: My younger brother left the lights on (without turning them off).
        hint: 「～まま」 is neutral and simply describes a state. We're looking for an expression that suggests
          carelessness or neglect, which is typical for 「～っぱなし」. 「つけっぱなし」 implies an unintentional or
          neglectful action.

        english: Don't leave the door open (like that).
        hint: 「～まま」 is neutral. This situation needs a phrase that expresses annoyance or a problem caused
          by the action, which 「～っぱなし」 conveys.

          - そんな に ドア を 開け っぱなし に やめ て！
        english: Stop leaving the door open like that!
        hint: While 「やめて」 means stop, the correct auxiliary verb to use with the verb stem is 「～にしないで」,
          indicating the state not to be maintained. We're looking for the proper grammatical formation.

        english: My roommate always leaves the toothpaste lid open.
        hint: While both are grammatically correct, 「～っぱなし」 better expresses the speaker's frustration
          or complaint about the recurring careless action, which is the nuance sought here.
    scene: A student complaining about their roommate's habits.

    nuance: The use of 「開けっぱなしにする」 implies a habit of leaving the cap off due to carelessness, which the
      speaker finds annoying. The sentence ends with 「～んだ」 which is a casual, explanatory particle often
      used to convey a complaint or provide context in a conversational setting. This expresses the female
      speaker's slight exasperation to her female listener.

        english: Leaving the task half-done is unprofessional.
        hint: While 「やりかけ」 (half-done) is close, 「やりっぱなし」 specifically emphasizes the act of doing it
          and then neglecting it, leaving it in an incomplete state due to carelessness, which is the
          specific nuance for this grammar point.

          - 今 の 子供 たち は、おもちゃ を 散らかっ た まま に し がち だ。
        english: Kids today tend to leave their toys in a scattered state.
        hint: 「～まま」 focuses on the state. 「～っぱなし」, attached to the verb stem 「散らかし」 (from 散らかす - to scatter),
          emphasizes the action of scattering and then neglecting to clean up. The addition of 「～しがちだ」
          reinforces the tendency to be careless.
    scene: An adult commenting on children's habits.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「散らかしっぱなしにしがちだ」 implies a habit of scattering toys and leaving them without tidying
      up. The use of 「～がちだ」 (tend to) softens the complaint while still pointing out a common, slightly
      negative behavior. The older speaker expresses a general observation about younger generations.

        english: If you leave the computer on, its lifespan shortens.
        hint: 「～まま」 is neutral. While correct, 「～っぱなし」 emphasizes the continuous, potentially problematic,
          state of leaving it on without turning it off, suggesting a habitual neglect for its well-being.
          This is a common warning.
    scene: A tech-savvy person advising a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「つけっぱなしにすると」 conveys a causal link between the careless habit of leaving the computer
      on and its negative consequence (shortened lifespan). The casual 「よ」 at the end is a common male-leaning
      sentence-final particle for giving advice or information, making the tone friendly but firm.

          of insensitivity or disregard for others, implying he was talking without interruption or concern
          for others' input. This is a common negative nuance.
