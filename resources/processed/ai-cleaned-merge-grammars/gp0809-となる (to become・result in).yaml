jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  function: Expresses a definitive change of state, an outcome, or an established fact.
  nuance: More formal, definitive, or declarative than 「になる」. It implies a conclusion, a rule, or a natural
    progression. Often used in written language, announcements, or formal speech.
etymology: The expression 「となる」 is a compound of the particle 「と」 and the verb 「なる」. The particle 「と」,
  in this context, functions to mark the resulting state or identity, similar to 'as' or 'into'. The verb
  「なる」 means 'to become'. Historically, 「と」 emphasizes the completed transformation or the specific nature
  of the change, making 「となる」 a more definitive or official sounding 'to become' compared to the more
  general 「になる」. It is often used when the transformation is a formal decision, a natural consequence,
  or an established fact.
writeup: The grammatical pattern 「となる」 expresses a change of state, an outcome, or a result, carrying
  a more formal or definitive nuance than the more common 「になる」. While both mean "to become" or "to turn
  into," 「となる」 is frequently used in written documents, official announcements, or formal speech to state
  an established fact, a decision, or a natural consequence. It highlights the definitive nature of the
  transformation. For instance, if a decision is made, or a rule is established, 「となる」 is often preferred
  over 「になる」. It can also describe a natural or logical progression leading to a certain state or outcome.
  This nuance often conveys a sense of certainty or a finality that 「になる」 might not always possess. Think
  of 「となる」 as stating "it is determined to be" or "it results in." It's less about a personal transformation
  and more about an objective fact or a collective decision.

  - term: になる (to become)
    meaning: to become
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「になる」 is the general and most common way to say "to become." It's versatile and can be used
      in almost any context, from personal changes to natural phenomena. 「となる」 is more formal and emphasizes
      the definitive nature or outcome.
    grammar_point: になる・くなる (to become)
  - term: 〜ことになる (it has been decided)
    meaning: it has been decided; it turns out that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「となる」 and 「ことになる」 can describe an outcome, 「ことになる」 specifically implies that the
      outcome was reached through a decision, a rule, or an unavoidable circumstance, often external to
      the speaker's direct will. 「となる」 states the outcome itself as a fact.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:'[Verb-dictionary]ことになる (it has been decided・to turn out that)'
  - term: とする (to decide; to assume)
    meaning: to decide; to assume; to treat as
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「とする」 indicates that someone *decides* or *assumes* something to be a certain way, or *treats*
      something as such. 「となる」 states what something *actually becomes* or *results in*. There's a clear
      distinction between an active decision/assumption and a factual outcome.
    grammar_point: とする (to assume・to decide)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「となる」, 「になる」, 「〜ことになる」, and 「とする」 all relate to states or outcomes,
  understanding their specific contexts is key. 「になる」 is your everyday "to become." 「となる」 lends a more
  formal or definitive tone, often for established facts or determined outcomes. 「〜ことになる」 explains that
  something came to be due to a decision or circumstance. Lastly, 「とする」 describes actively deciding or
  treating something as a certain way, rather than stating a factual outcome. Pay attention to the formality
  and the source of the change or determination.
