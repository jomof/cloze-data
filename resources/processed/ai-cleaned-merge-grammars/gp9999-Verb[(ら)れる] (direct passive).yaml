etymology: The Japanese passive voice originates from classical Japanese auxiliary verbs 「る」 (ru) for
  Godan verbs and 「らる」 (raru) for Ichidan verbs. These classical forms conveyed meanings of spontaneity,
  potential, and passive voice. Over time, the passive meaning became the predominant use for the modern
  「れる」 and 「られる」 forms. This evolution shows a shift from a broader sense of 'being in a state' or 'happening
  to' to the specific notion of 'being acted upon'.
writeup: |-
  The direct passive voice in Japanese, formed with the auxiliary verbs 「れる」 or 「られる」, indicates that the grammatical subject of the sentence is the recipient of an action. This is in contrast to the active voice, where the subject performs the action. While it can be used neutrally, such as in scientific descriptions or formal announcements, it very frequently carries a nuance of the subject experiencing an unwanted, inconvenient, or unfortunate event.

  For example, if you say 「犬が私を噛みました」 (The dog bit me), it's active. If you use the passive, 「私は犬に噛まれました」 (I was bitten by the dog), the focus shifts to 'I' who experienced the biting. This often implies a sense of misfortune, though not always. The agent (the dog) is often marked with the particle 「に」.

  Understanding the passive voice is crucial for expressing a wider range of situations where the focus is on what happens *to* someone or something, rather than what someone or something *does*.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
    meaning: can do; is able to do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: For Ichidan verbs, the passive form 「られる」 is identical to the potential form. For example,
      「食べられる」 can mean 'can eat' (potential) or 'is eaten' (passive). Context is crucial for distinguishing
      these. Godan verbs are usually distinct (e.g., 書く -> 書ける for potential, 書かれる for passive).
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
  - term: Verb[させられる] (causative-passive)
    meaning: is made to do; is forced to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both involve the subject being acted upon, the causative-passive specifically means
      the subject is *forced* or *made* to do something, often against their will, leading to a strong
      sense of burden or suffering. The direct passive simply means the subject *receives* an action.
    grammar_point: Verb[させられる] (causative-passive)
  - term: Verb[(ら)れる] (adversative passive)
    meaning: someone (or something) related to the subject is negatively affected by an action
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The adversative passive is a specific type of passive construction where the action, while
      done to someone or something else, negatively affects the *subject* of the sentence. The direct
      passive can also imply negative impact on the subject, but the adversative passive specifically
      highlights this indirect suffering. The grammatical structure is often the same as the direct passive,
      making context vital.
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (adversative passive)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'Distinguishing the passive from the potential form is a common hurdle, especially
  with Ichidan verbs. Always consider the context: is the sentence about capability or about being acted
  upon? The causative-passive adds the layer of being forced, and the adversative passive implies indirect
  suffering. Paying close attention to the particles (e.g., who is 「に」, who is 「が」) and the overall meaning
  of the verb can help clarify.'

      softens the negative feeling slightly compared to a casual plain form.

      formal or informative contexts like book descriptions.

    setting: casual slang
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    nuance: This example highlights the common use of the passive to express an unwanted or involuntary
      experience. Even with an inanimate or non-human agent like a mosquito, the passive emphasizes the
      recipient of the action and the inconvenience they suffered. The verb 刺す (sasu) means 'to sting/bite'
      (for insects).

    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The passive form 「叱られた」 expresses a past negative experience. The addition of 「ものです」 (mono
      desu) adds a nuance of nostalgic recollection or habit in the past, often used when sharing common
      experiences or memories. This construction emphasizes the repeated nature of being scolded.
  - english: The decision was made at the meeting yesterday.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative

      is unknown or irrelevant. This is very common in formal or business contexts, avoiding direct attribution
      of responsibility and focusing on the event itself.
  - english: I was invited to a party by a friend.

    setting: excited
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    nuance: This is a neutral use of the passive voice, indicating a positive event where the subject
      is the recipient of the invitation.
post_example_writeup: The passive voice allows for flexibility in expressing actions, particularly when
  the agent is unknown, irrelevant, or when emphasizing the recipient of the action. Pay close attention
  to the nuance; while not always negative, it frequently implies an involuntary or undesirable experience
  for the subject. Mastering the passive is key to comprehending a wide array of Japanese expressions.
