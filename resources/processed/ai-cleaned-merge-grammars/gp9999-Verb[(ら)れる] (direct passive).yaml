jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used when the subject is the recipient of an action, either neutrally or when the action
    is perceived as negative, troublesome, or unwelcome by the subject (suffering passive).
  function: Indicates that the subject undergoes an action or is affected by it, shifting focus from actor
    to recipient. This can be a neutral statement of fact or imply an adverse impact on the subject.
  nuance: The passive voice can be used neutrally in formal or objective contexts (e.g., news reports)
    or to describe natural occurrences. However, it often carries a nuance of misfortune or an action
    occurring against one's will, especially when the agent is explicitly stated with 「に」, implying the
    subject experienced an inconvenience, annoyance, or emotional distress. This is known as the 'suffering'
    or 'adversative' passive. The agent is often omitted if unknown, unimportant, or obvious.
  counterpoint: Contrasts sharply with the active voice, which focuses on the agent performing the action.
    It also distinguishes between neutral actions and actions that specifically impose a negative consequence
    on the subject.
  grammatical-role: Transforms a transitive or intransitive verb into a form where the original object
    (or the subject of an intransitive verb) becomes the new subject, receiving the action. The original
    agent, if mentioned, is marked by 「に」. In the suffering passive, the subject is highlighted as the
    'victim' or affected party.
  logical-flow: Reverses the direction of the action from agent-to-object to object-receiving-action.
  temporal-flow: Does not inherently change the temporal flow; it describes an action completed or experienced
    by the subject at a given time.
etymology: The Japanese passive forms 「れる」 and 「られる」 originate from the classical Japanese auxiliary verbs
  「る」 and 「らる」. These older forms conveyed both passive and potential meanings. Over centuries, while
  the passive function solidified primarily with 「れる/られる」, the potential meaning diversified, leading
  to distinct potential verb forms (e.g., Godan verbs like 「読める」) and analytical constructions. The phonetic
  differentiation between 「れる」 for Godan verbs and 「られる」 for Ichidan verbs (and irregular verbs like 「来る」
  and 「する」) makes pronunciation smoother. The 'suffering' or 'adversative' nuance developed from contexts
  where the passive reception of an action naturally led to an undesirable outcome for the subject, thus
  solidifying this specific emotional connotation.
writeup: "The Japanese passive voice, formed by adding 「れる」 or 「られる」 to the verb stem, allows the subject\
  \ of the sentence to be the recipient of an action, rather than the performer. This grammatical construction\
  \ has two primary uses: a neutral/direct passive and a suffering/adversative passive. \n\nFor **Godan\
  \ verbs**, you change the final 「う」 sound to an 「あ」 sound and add 「れる」. For example, 「読む (yomu - to\
  \ read)」 becomes 「読まれる (yomareru - to be read)」.\n\nFor **Ichidan verbs**, you drop the final 「る」 and\
  \ add 「られる」. For example, 「食べる (taberu - to eat)」 becomes 「食べられる (taberareru - to be eaten)」.\n\n**Irregular\
  \ verbs** have their own passive forms: 「する (suru - to do)」 becomes 「される (sareru - to be done)」, and\
  \ 「来る (kuru - to come)」 becomes 「来られる (korareru - to be come to or visited by)」.\n\nIn its **neutral/direct\
  \ passive** use, this form simply states that an action was performed on someone or something without\
  \ implying any particular emotional impact on the subject. It is frequently used in objective contexts,\
  \ such as news reports, scientific writing, or when describing natural phenomena. For instance, 「日本で日本語が話される」\
  \ (Japanese is spoken in Japan) is a neutral statement of fact.\n\nThe **suffering/adversative passive**\
  \ (also known as the 'indirect passive') is used when the subject of the sentence is negatively affected\
  \ by an action performed by another party. This form explicitly conveys that the subject experienced\
  \ some kind of trouble, inconvenience, or emotional distress as a result of the action. The nuance is\
  \ always negative from the subject's perspective, even if the action itself might seem neutral. For\
  \ example, 「雨に降られた」 (I was rained on) implies that the rain caused inconvenience or ruined plans. \n\
  \nThe agent (the one performing the action) can be indicated using the particle 「に」, but it is very\
  \ common for the agent to be omitted, especially if it is unknown, unimportant, or clear from context.\
  \ While the basic passive simply states what happened, the suffering passive highlights the personal\
  \ impact on the subject. The distinction between these two nuances often relies heavily on the context\
  \ and the speaker's implied feelings."

  - term: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
    meaning: can do, able to do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 'Passive voice expresses that the subject *receives* an action, whereas the potential form
      expresses the subject''s *ability* to perform an action. For Godan verbs, the forms are distinct
      (e.g., 「読む (yomu)」: passive 「読まれる」, potential 「読める」). However, for Ichidan verbs, the forms are
      identical (e.g., 「食べる (taberu)」: passive 「食べられる」, potential 「食べられる」), requiring context to differentiate.'
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
  - term: Verb[させられる] (causative-passive)
    meaning: to be made to do, to be forced to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both the passive and causative-passive involve the subject being acted upon, the causative-passive
      specifically means being *forced* or *caused* to perform an action by someone else, often implying
      unwilling participation or negative feeling. The simple passive means undergoing an action without
      the explicit nuance of coercion, though the direct passive can also imply misfortune.
    grammar_point: Verb[させられる] (causative-passive)
  - term: お[Verb-stem]になる・なさる・いらっしゃる (respectful action - sonkeigo)
    meaning: respectful form of verbs
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: The passive forms can also be used as honorifics (尊敬語) to elevate the status of the person
      performing the action (e.g., 「先生が話される (Sensei speaks)」). In this usage, there is no implied external
      agent; the honorific simply expresses respect for the subject. Context is crucial for distinguishing
      between passive and honorific usage.
    grammar_point: お[Verb-stem]になる・なさる・いらっしゃる (respectful action - sonkeigo)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the distinction between the passive, potential, and honorific
  forms of verbs is crucial. While their constructions may overlap, especially for Ichidan verbs and in
  honorific usage, their fundamental meanings differ. The passive describes what *happens to* the subject,
  the potential describes what the subject *can do*, and honorifics simply show *respect* to the subject's
  actions. Always consider the context, the presence of an agent (marked by 「に」 for passive), and the
  overall politeness level to correctly interpret these forms.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の ケーキ を 誰 か が 食べ まし た。
        english: Someone ate my cake.
        hint: This sentence uses the active voice, focusing on the actor. We're looking for a sentence
          where the cake is the focus of the action, or where the speaker is adversely affected by it.
    scene: You come home to find your carefully prepared cake is gone.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 は 私 を 褒め まし た。
        english: The teacher praised me.
        hint: This active sentence focuses on the teacher's action. We need a sentence where 'I' am the
          one receiving the praise.
    scene: You just received a good grade on your test.
    register: casual
    setting: optimistic
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)

      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 人 は 日本 語 を 話し ます。
        english: Japanese people speak Japanese.
        hint: This specifies 'Japanese people' as the speaker. We're looking for a general statement about
          the language itself.

    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
  - english: My wallet was stolen by someone.
    japanese:
      - 誰 か に 財布 を {盗ま れ た}。
      - 誰 か に 財布 を {盗ま れ まし た}。
    english_literally: By someone, wallet was stolen.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 誰 か に 財布 を 盗ま せ た。
        english: I made someone steal my wallet.
        hint: This uses the causative form, meaning the speaker caused someone to steal. We're looking
          for a verb that indicates the speaker was the victim of the theft and experienced it negatively.
    scene: You arrive home and realize your wallet is gone. You immediately understand what happened.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The use of 「盗まれた」 (nusumareta) directly conveys the speaker's personal suffering and loss,
      which is characteristic of the adversative passive. The particle 「に」 (ni) marks the agent (誰か -
      someone) who caused the adverse event.
  - english: My dog died.
    japanese:
      - 犬 に {死な れ た}。
      - 犬 に {死な れ まし た}。
    english_literally: By the dog, I was died upon (adversely).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 犬 が 死ん だ。
        english: The dog died.
        hint: This is a simple statement of fact. We're looking for an expression that conveys the speaker's
          personal sorrow or negative impact from the dog's death.
    scene: Your friend notices you're sad and asks what's wrong. You respond with the reason for your
      sadness.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: While the literal translation sounds odd in English, 「犬に{死なれた}」 (inu ni shinareta) perfectly
      captures the speaker's grief and personal suffering due to their dog's death. The animal (犬) is
      treated as the agent that causes the suffering by dying, marking a profound personal loss. This
      is a common and empathetic use of the adversative passive in Japanese, showing the speaker's connection
      and sorrow.
  - english: I was rained on right after doing my hair.
    japanese:
      - せっかく 髪 を セット し た の に、雨 に {降ら れ た}。
      - せっかく 髪 を セット し た の に、雨 に {降ら れ まし た}。
    english_literally: Even though I went to the trouble of setting my hair, by rain, I was rained upon
      (adversely).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - せっかく 髪 を セット し た の に、雨 が 降っ た。
        english: Even though I went to the trouble of setting my hair, it rained.
        hint: This simply states that it rained. We're looking for an expression that conveys the speaker's
          annoyance or disappointment because the rain ruined their effort.
    scene: You just spent a long time perfecting your hairstyle before heading out. Suddenly, it starts
      raining.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The phrase 「雨に{降られた}」 (ame ni furareta) expresses the speaker's annoyance and regret that
      their effort in setting their hair was wasted due to the unexpected rain. This illustrates how the
      adversative passive is used for inconvenient or frustrating events caused by natural phenomena.
  - english: I was made fun of by my younger brother, so I cried.
    japanese:
      - 弟 に {からかわ れ て}、泣い て しまっ た。
      - 弟 に {からかわ れ て}、泣い て しまい まし た。
    english_literally: By my younger brother, I was made fun of (adversely) and cried.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 弟 に から かわさ れ て、泣い て しまっ た。
        english: I was forced to be made fun of by my younger brother, so I cried.
        hint: This uses the causative-passive, implying the speaker was forced to endure the teasing.
          We're looking for a direct adverse action done *to* the speaker, not one they were forced to
          experience.
    scene: A child is recounting a sad event to their parent.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「からかわれて」 (karakawarete) in the te-form of the adversative passive clearly indicates
      that the speaker (a child) was the unwilling recipient of the younger brother's teasing, leading
      to their crying. The particle 「に」 (ni) marks the agent (弟 - younger brother).
  - english: I was called by name by Sensei.
    japanese:
      - 先生 に 名前 を {呼ば れ まし た}。
      - 先生 に 名前 を {呼ば れ た}。
    english_literally: By Sensei name was called.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 は 私 の 名前 を 呼び まし た。
        english: Sensei called my name.
        hint: This active sentence focuses on the teacher's action. We need a sentence where 'I' am the
          one whose name was called. The passive voice also expresses respect for the person who called
          the name.
    scene: You are in class and the teacher is taking attendance.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: This is a common use of the passive voice to express being affected by an action, particularly
      when the action is somewhat impersonal or done by a figure of authority like 「先生」. The subject 「私」
      is omitted but implied, and the agent 「先生」 is marked with 「に」. While 「先生が私の名前を呼びました」 is also grammatically
      correct, the passive 「呼ばれました」 often feels more natural when the speaker wants to highlight their
      experience of being called. In this context, it can also subtly convey respect for the teacher,
      making it less direct.
  - english: My favorite mug was accidentally broken by my little brother.
    japanese:
      - お 気 に 入り の マグ カップ を 弟 に {割ら れ ちゃい まし た}。
      - お 気 に 入り の マグ カップ は 弟 に {割ら れ まし た}。
      - お 気 に 入り の マグ カップ は 弟 に {割ら れ た}。
    english_literally: Favorite mug by little brother was accidentally broken.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 弟 が お 気 に 入り の マグ カップ を 割っ ちゃい まし た。
        english: My little brother accidentally broke my favorite mug.
        hint: This active sentence highlights the brother's action. We need the mug to be the subject,
          and the speaker expresses misfortune about it.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 弟 は お 気 に 入り の マグ カップ を 割ら せ まし た。
        english: My little brother made someone break my favorite mug. (causative)
        hint: This implies the brother *caused* someone to break it. We're looking for the mug being broken
          *by* the brother, with a nuance of misfortune for the speaker.
    scene: You discover your treasured mug in pieces.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of 「割られちゃいました」 combines the passive voice 「割られる」 with the 「～ちゃう」 contraction of 「～てしまう」,
      adding a nuance of completion, regret, or an accidental occurrence. The particle 「に」 marks the agent
      「弟」, and the entire phrase implies the speaker's personal misfortune or slight annoyance at their
      younger brother's action.
  - english: Oh no, my customer just left!
    japanese:
      - しまっ た、お 客 さん に {帰ら れ た}！
      - しまっ た、お 客 さん に {帰ら れ まし た}！
    english_literally: Darn, by the customer, I was left (adversely)!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - しまっ た、お 客 さん が 帰っ た。
        english: Darn, the customer left.
        hint: This simply states the fact that the customer left. We're looking for an expression that
          implies the speaker (e.g., a salesperson) feels a negative impact from this action.
    scene: You are a salesperson in a shop, and you were just about to approach a customer when they suddenly
      walk out.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The interjection 「しまった」 (shimatta) immediately sets the tone of regret and frustration. 「お客さんに{帰られた}」
      (okyaku-san ni kaerareta) uses the adversative passive to express the speaker's disappointment that
      the customer left before they could make a sale or assist them, implying a missed opportunity or
      inconvenience.
  - english: My neighbor's child has been crying all night, and it's making me suffer.
    japanese:
      - 隣 の 子供 に 一 晩 中 {泣か れ て}、本当 に 困っ て いる。
      - 隣 の 子供 に 一 晩 中 {泣か れ て}、本当 に 困っ て い ます。
    english_literally: By the neighbor's child, I was cried upon (adversely) all night, truly troubled
      (I am).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 隣 の 子供 が 一 晩 中 泣い て いる の で、本当 に 困っ て いる。
        english: The neighbor's child has been crying all night, so I'm truly troubled.
        hint: This directly states the child is crying and the speaker is troubled, but doesn't use the
          passive. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes the speaker being the direct recipient
          of the nuisance.
    scene: You're complaining to a friend about a sleepless night.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: 「隣の子供に一晩中{泣かれて}」 (tonari no kodomo ni ichibanjuu nakarete) vividly expresses the speaker's
      prolonged suffering and annoyance caused by the neighbor's child crying throughout the night. The
      te-form links this cause to the resulting trouble (困っている - komatteiru).
post_example_writeup: The passive voice is a versatile grammatical tool that can shift sentence focus,
  describe unfortunate events, or convey objective information. Pay close attention to context when encountering
  sentences that could be interpreted as passive, potential, or honorific, as the shared verb endings
  can sometimes lead to confusion. Practice distinguishing these usages by considering who is doing what
  to whom, and the implied feelings or formality of the speaker.
