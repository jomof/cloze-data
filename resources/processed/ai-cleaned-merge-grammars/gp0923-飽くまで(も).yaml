    "etymology": "The term 「飽くまで」 comes from 「飽く」 (aku), an older form of 「飽きる」 (akiru), which means \"to tire of.\" When combined with 「まで」 (made), meaning \"until,\" it literally implies doing something \"until you get tired of it,\" which has evolved to mean doing something only to a certain extent or in a certain way.",
    "writeup": "「飽くまで(も)」 functions as an adverb, expressing that something is strictly or merely a certain way, with no deviation. 「飽くまで」 is derived from the verb 「飽きる」 meaning \"to tire of,\" combined with 「まで」 meaning \"until.\" Adding 「も」 provides extra emphasis but is optional. It's often used at the beginning of a phrase to convey that something is \"just\" an opinion or a possibility. In polite speech, it softens statements by implying awareness of other viewpoints, often paired with conjunctions like 「けど」 or 「が」.",

The scene describes a manager's instruction, implying a need to emphasize the *strict* state of being a new employee, which 「あくまでも」 conveys by stressing the inherent limitation or nature, rather than just quantity or simplicity."
