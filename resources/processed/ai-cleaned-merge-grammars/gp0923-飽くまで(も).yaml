    "etymology": "The grammar point 「飽くまで(も)」 is derived from the verb 「飽く」 (aku), an older form of 「飽きる」 (akiru), which means \"to tire of\" or \"to get sick of.\" The addition of 「まで」 (made), meaning \"until,\" creates the sense of continuing something to the point of being tired of it, thus implying a limit or restriction. The 「も」 (mo) is optional and adds emphasis.",
    "writeup": "「飽くまで(も)」 functions as an adverb, indicating that something is \"just,\" \"only,\" \"merely,\" or \"strictly\" the case. It implies a limit or restriction, suggesting that something will not deviate from what is being described. It's often used to express the speaker's personal opinion in a polite way, conveying that it's just their view and not necessarily the only valid one. The 「も」 is optional and adds emphasis. It often appears at the beginning of a phrase and is combined with structures like 「けど」 or 「が」 to soften the statement.",
