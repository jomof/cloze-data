    },
    "etymology": "The term 「飽くまで」 comes from 「飽く」 (aku), an older form of 「飽きる」 (akiru), which means \"to tire of.\" When combined with 「まで」 (made), meaning \"until,\" it literally implies doing something \"until you get tired of it,\" which has evolved to mean doing something only to a certain extent or in a certain way. This transformation reflects a linguistic shift from physical exhaustion to a conceptual limit or strict adherence.",
    "writeup": "「飽くまで(も)」 functions as an adverb, expressing that something is **strictly** or **merely** a certain way, with no deviation. The core meaning derives from 「飽きる」 (akiru), meaning \"to tire of\" or \"to be fed up with,\" combined with 「まで」 (made), meaning \"until.\" This creates a nuance of continuing something \"to the point of getting tired of it\" or \"to its utmost limit,\" thus conveying that something is only or exclusively what it is described as.\n\nThe addition of 「も」 (mo) is optional and serves to add extra emphasis, intensifying the sense of 'strictly' or 'only.'\n\nThis grammar point often appears at the beginning of a phrase and is frequently used to soften a statement or to disclaim one's personal opinion as merely a hypothesis or a possibility. In such contexts, it conveys that the speaker recognizes their statement is not a definitive truth or the only viewpoint available. This use is common in polite speech and may be combined with conjunctions like 「けど」 or 「が」 to further temper the expression.",

            "meaning": "just, simply, merely",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ただ」 is a simpler adverb often used to indicate something is merely simple or common, or without special meaning. 「飽くまで(も)」 emphasizes that something is *strictly* or *only* to a certain definition or extent, often implying a limitation or a strong adherence to a particular state. It carries a nuance of \"nothing more than\" or \"to the very end/limit of being\" rather than just \"simply.\""

            "term": "単なる",
            "meaning": "mere, simple, only",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「単なる」 also means \"mere\" or \"simple,\" typically used before a noun. While it denotes simplicity or triviality, it doesn't carry the \"to the very end/limit\" or \"strictly\" nuance of 「飽くまで(も)」. 「飽くまで(も)」 can imply a more deliberate or inherent limitation or characterization, suggesting a deeper adherence to a state rather than just a simple classification."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「飽くまで(も)」, 「ただ」, and 「単なる」 can all express a sense of 'just' or 'merely,' their nuances differ. 「ただ」 and 「単なる」 (which typically modifies nouns) often imply simplicity, commonness, or a lack of special significance. In contrast, 「飽くまで(も)」 emphasizes a strict adherence to a definition, a limitation, or a provisional state. It strongly conveys \"nothing more than\" or \"to the utmost extent of being\" in a more formal or emphatic way, suggesting an inherent or deliberate constraint rather than mere simplicity.",
