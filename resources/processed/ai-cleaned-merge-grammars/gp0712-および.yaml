    "etymology": "The term 「および」 originates from the conjunctive form of the verb 「及ぶ (およぶ)」, meaning \"to reach\" or \"to extend to\". Thus, 「および」 literally carries the nuance of extending to include something else, which is why it functions as a formal \"and\".",
    "writeup": "「および」 functions as a conjunction, similar to \"and\" or \"as well as\" in English, but it has a more formal tone. It originates from the verb 「及ぶ」, meaning \"to reach\" or \"to extend to\", lending it a sense of adding something to what has already been mentioned.\n\n*   It's primarily used to connect nouns or clauses in formal writing, documents, articles, and notifications.\n*   Due to its formality, you'll rarely hear it in casual conversation.\n*   It conveys a sense of addition, similar to how something 'extends to' include something else.",
