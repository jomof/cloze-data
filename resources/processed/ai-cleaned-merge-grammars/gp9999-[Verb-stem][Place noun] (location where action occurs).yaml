jlpt: N4
etymology: The formation of these compound nouns stems from the Japanese language's agglutinative nature,
  where verb stems (連用形 - ren'yōkei) naturally combine with nouns to create new concepts. This particular
  pattern specializes in indicating a *place* directly associated with the verb's action, a linguistic
  shortcut that evolved for efficiency and clarity in naming common locations or facilities.
writeup: |-
  The grammatical pattern `[Verb-stem][Place noun]` is used to form compound nouns that denote a place or area where a specific action typically occurs or is designated to occur. This construction is a type of nominalization where the verb stem (連用形 - ren'yōkei) combines directly with a noun indicating a place.

  While the concept is straightforward, the specific `Place noun` used often carries a nuance about the type of place:
  *   **~場 (ba):** This is the most common and versatile, referring to a general area, venue, or facility. Examples include 遊び場 (asobiba - playground), 売り場 (uriba - sales floor), and 休み場 (yasumiba - resting place).
  *   **~口 (kuchi):** This refers to an entrance, exit, or opening where the action occurs. Examples are 乗り口 (norikuchi - boarding gate/entrance) and 出し口 (dashiguchi - dispensing outlet).
  *   **~所 (tokoro):** This often denotes a more specific spot or a public/designated place for the action. An example is 待ち合わせ所 (machiawasejo - meeting spot).
  *   **~台 (dai):** This refers to a stand, platform, or base used for the action. Examples include 滑り台 (suberidai - slide) and 見張り台 (miharidai - lookout platform).

  These compound nouns function grammatically like any other noun in a sentence. Understanding this pattern helps in recognizing and forming names for various common locations in Japanese.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[dictionary] + こと
    meaning: nominalization of a verb to refer to the action or fact itself
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While `[Verb-stem][Place noun]` creates a noun for a *place* of action, `Verb[dictionary]
      + こと` nominalizes the verb to refer to the *act* or *occurrence* of the action itself, not a physical
      location. For example, 「泳ぐこと」 (oyogu koto) means 'the act of swimming' or 'swimming (in general)'.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]こと (the act of・the fact that)'
  - term: Verb[dictionary] + の
    meaning: nominalization of a verb to refer to the action or fact itself (informal)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to `こと`, `Verb[dictionary] + の` also nominalizes the verb to refer to the action itself.
      It's often used in more casual contexts. For example, 「泳ぐの」 (oyogu no) also means 'the act of swimming'
      but in a more conversational tone, still referring to the action, not a place.
    grammar_point: の (that ~)
  - term: Verb[stem] + 方
    meaning: the method or way of doing something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Though it also uses a verb stem combined with a noun, `Verb[stem] + 方` (`~kata`) refers to
      the *method* or *how* an action is performed, not a physical location. For example, 「泳ぎ方」 (oyogikata)
      means 'the way to swim' or 'how to swim', which is distinct from a 'swimming place'.
    grammar_point: かた (way of doing)
  - term: Verb[dictionary] + Noun
    meaning: a noun modified by a verb in its dictionary form
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This construction (e.g., 「泳ぐ 場所」 - oyogu basho, 'the place where one swims') uses a verb in
      its dictionary form to descriptively modify a general noun like `場所` (place). In contrast, `[Verb-stem][Place
      noun]` forms a fixed compound noun (e.g., 「遊び場」 - asobiba, 'playground'), often implying a designated
      facility, and the relationship is more inherent than descriptive.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-dictionary]Noun (nominalization)
post_false_friends_writeup: It's crucial to distinguish `[Verb-stem][Place noun]` from other nominalizations
  or verb-noun combinations. While some might express a similar idea, the `[Verb-stem][Place noun]` pattern
  specifically forms a *compound noun* for a *designated or characteristic place* where the action occurs.
  Pay attention to whether you are referring to the *act itself*, the *method*, or a *descriptive phrase*
  versus a *named place*.

    scene: Friends planning to meet up for dinner.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「待ち合わせ場所」 (machiawase basho) is a common and natural compound noun for 'meeting place.' While
      「場所」 (basho) is a general noun for 'place,' combined with 「待ち合わせ」 (machiawase, from `待つ` and `合わせる`
      stems), it forms a specific concept. 「会おましょう」 (aimashou) is the volitional form of the verb for
      meeting, making it a suggestion.

    setting: informative
    nuance: 「滑り台」 (suberidai) is a specific compound noun for 'slide.' This is a very common and natural
      term for children's play equipment. The use of 「が 大好き です」 (ga daisuki desu) shows a strong liking
      in polite language.

      casual register suits a descriptive explanation.

    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「休み場」 (yasumiba) refers to a place designated or naturally suited for resting. While less
      common than 休憩所 (kyuukeijo), it is a valid compound noun formed from the verb stem of `休む` (yasumu
      - to rest). The usage here implies a simple, natural resting spot.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in these examples, `[Verb-stem][Place noun]` consistently forms
  fixed terms for specific locations. This distinguishes it from more general descriptions of places or
  nominalizations of actions. Mastering these common compounds is essential for natural Japanese expression,
  particularly when referring to facilities or designated areas.
