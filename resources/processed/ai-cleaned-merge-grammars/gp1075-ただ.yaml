        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "casual",
        "function": "Introduces a contrasting or supplementary idea.",
        "colocation": "Often followed by a negative or limiting statement, or a point of concern. Can be preceded by が or けど.",
        "grammatical-role": "Connects clauses or sentences, often at the beginning of a new sentence or clause.",
        "logical-flow": "Signals a shift from a general statement to a specific limitation, exception, or an additional, often negative, point."
    },
    "etymology": "The word ただ originally meant \"only\" or \"just.\" Over time, it evolved to also function as a conjunction, introducing a contrasting or supplementary remark. This conjunctive usage retains the sense of \"only,\" as in \"the only thing is...\"",
    "writeup": "The conjunction 「ただ」 is used to introduce a supplementary remark, exception, or contrasting idea to a preceding statement. It functions similarly to \"but\" or \"however\" in English, but with a specific nuance of highlighting a minor reservation, limitation, or the *only* pertinent drawback. It is used to add a limiting or additional point to the previous idea, often one that causes a slight concern or serves as a minor counterpoint.\n\nIt can be used in the following patterns:\n\n*   **Sentence 1. ただ、Sentence 2.** This pattern is often used to present a **single, specific reservation** or the **sole drawback** after a generally positive or neutral statement. It implies that everything else is fine, but this one point requires attention.\n*   **Sentence 1 が/けど、ただ Sentence 2.** When preceded by 「が」 or 「けど」, 「ただ」 serves to **further narrow down or pinpoint** the specific reservation or exception. The 「が/けど」 already introduces a contrast, and 「ただ」 refines it to emphasize that *this particular point* is the critical one. This construction can sometimes soften the impact of the reservation, making it sound like a focused, rather than overarching, issue.",

            "setting": "instructional",

            "etymology": "The word 「ただ」, meaning \"just\" or \"only,\" concisely introduces the single, primary point of feedback without dwelling on it."

                    "mitigation": "「しかし」 would imply a stronger, more formal contradiction. The scene, which depicts a casual conversation between friends, favors 「ただ」 to express a milder, single reservation without making the critique sound overly harsh or formal."

                    "mitigation": "While 「でも」 also means 'but,' the combination of 「～んですけど」 and 「ただ」 creates a more nuanced expression of a single, specific drawback. The scene suggests a personal, intimate confession where the speaker is seeking advice, making the precise pinpointing of the issue with 「ただ」 more fitting."
