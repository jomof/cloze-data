    "etymology": "The word ただ originally meant \"only\" or \"just.\" Over time, it evolved to also function as a conjunction, introducing a contrasting or supplementary remark. This conjunctive usage retains the sense of \"only,\" as in \"the only thing is...\"",
    "writeup": "The conjunction 「ただ」 is used to introduce a supplementary remark, exception, or contrasting idea to a preceding statement. It functions similarly to \"but\" or \"however\" in English, but with a specific nuance of highlighting a minor reservation, limitation, or the *only* pertinent drawback. It is used to add a limiting or additional point to the previous idea, often one that causes a slight concern or serves as a minor counterpoint.\n\nIt can be used in the following patterns:\n\n*   **Sentence 1. ただ、Sentence 2.** This pattern is often used to present a **single, specific reservation** or the **sole drawback** after a generally positive or neutral statement. It implies that everything else is fine, but this one point requires attention.\n*   **Sentence 1 が/けど、ただ Sentence 2.** When preceded by 「が」 or 「けど」, 「ただ」 serves to **further narrow down or pinpoint** the specific reservation or exception. The 「が/けど」 already introduces a contrast, and 「ただ」 refines it to emphasize that *this particular point* is the critical one. This construction can sometimes soften the impact of the reservation, making it sound like a focused, rather than overarching, issue.",

            "nuance": "While 「ただ」 can mean 'only' (as in 'the only thing is...'), 「だけ」 is a particle that directly limits the scope of something. 「ただ」 introduces a contrasting thought or a specific reservation, often at the start of a clause, while 「だけ」 simply quantifies or restricts."

            "nuance": "「しかし」 is a more general and formal conjunction used to express a strong contrast or contradiction. Unlike 「ただ」, which often highlights a single, specific reservation or a minor counterpoint, 「しかし」 introduces a more significant opposing idea or a general shift in thought."

            "nuance": "「だが」 is a slightly more casual and often more assertive or emphatic version of 「しかし」, commonly used in writing or direct speech. While it also expresses contrast, 「ただ」 focuses on introducing a specific, often singular, reservation without the strong confrontational tone sometimes associated with 「だが」."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "「ただ」 is versatile for introducing supplementary remarks, similar to \"but\" or \"however,\" and can imply a single or primary reservation. On the other hand, 「ただし」 is a more formal term used to specify strict exceptions or conditions. 「だけ」 simply means \"only\" and is used to limit the scope or quantity of something, not to introduce a contrasting idea or a reservation about a preceding statement. 「しかし」 and 「だが」 are stronger, more general conjunctions for contrast. 「ただ」's specific nuance lies in pinpointing a *single* reservation or an *only* issue, making it less confrontational or broad than 「しかし」 or 「だが」.",

The use of 「長 すぎた」 (too long) and the overall casual register make this a common way to express minor dissatisfaction among friends. The use of 「かな」 in the second example softens the criticism even further, suggesting a personal thought.",

This reflects a careful, measured way of expressing a significant problem. In the casual example, 「マジ 安い んだ」 emphasizes the low pay.",
