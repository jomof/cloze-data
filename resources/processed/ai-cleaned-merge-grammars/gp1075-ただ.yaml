    "writeup": "The conjunction 「ただ」 is used to introduce a supplementary remark, exception, or contrasting idea to a preceding statement. It's similar to \"but\" or \"however\" in English. It is used to add a limitation, exception, or additional point to the previous idea. It can be used in the following ways:\n\n*   **Sentence 1. ただ、Sentence 2.** This is the most common pattern, where 「ただ」 connects two independent clauses.\n*   **Sentence 1 が/けど、ただ Sentence 2.** In this pattern, 「が」 or 「けど」 (but) connects the first part of the sentence, and 「ただ」 introduces the contrasting or supplementary idea.",
