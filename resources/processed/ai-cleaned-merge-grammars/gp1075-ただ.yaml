        "register": "casual",
        "function": "Introduces a contrasting or supplementary idea.",
        "colocation": "Often followed by a negative or limiting statement, or a point of concern. Can be preceded by 「が」 or 「けど」.",
        "grammatical-role": "Connects clauses or sentences, often at the beginning of a new sentence or clause.",
        "logical-flow": "Signals a shift from a general statement to a specific limitation, exception, or an additional, often negative, point."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「ただ」 originally meant \"only\" or \"just.\" Over time, it evolved to also function as a conjunction, introducing a contrasting or supplementary remark. This conjunctive usage retains the sense of \"only,\" as in \"the only thing is...\"",
    "writeup": "The conjunction 「ただ」 is used to introduce a supplementary remark, exception, or contrasting idea to a preceding statement. It functions similarly to \"but\" or \"however\" in English, but with a specific nuance of highlighting a minor reservation, limitation, or the *only* pertinent drawback. It is used to add a limiting or additional point to the previous idea, often one that causes a slight concern or serves as a minor counterpoint.\n\nIt can be used in the following patterns:\n\n*   **Sentence 1. ただ、Sentence 2.** This is the most common pattern, where 「ただ」 connects two independent clauses. The nuance here is often that the second sentence presents the *only* problem or a key exception to an otherwise positive or general statement.\n*   **Sentence 1 が/けど、ただ Sentence 2.** In this pattern, 「が」 or 「けど」 already introduces a contrasting idea, and 「ただ」 further refines or emphasizes a specific limitation within that contrast. It can make the reservation sound softer or more like a single, notable detail.",

            "scene": "A man who reviews tech gadgets is giving his honest opinion about a new laptop. He's generally impressed but needs to mention a minor downside.",
            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "The speaker uses 「ただ」 to introduce the *only* significant negative point after an otherwise positive assessment. It conveys a mild reservation rather than a strong contradiction.",
            "etymology": "The word 「ただ」 literally means 'just' or 'only', and here it emphasizes that the weight is the sole or primary negative aspect."

                    "mitigation": "「でも」 implies a stronger contradiction or a more direct 'but.' The scene, featuring casual conversation and a minor complaint, encourages the softer, more nuanced 「ただ」, which highlights a single, minor reservation."

The scene implies the manager sees value in the proposal but needs to address a *specific*, *single* hurdle. 「ただ」 is better here because it highlights this particular issue as the main reservation, not a complete rejection."
