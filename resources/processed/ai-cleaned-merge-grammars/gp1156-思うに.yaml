    "writeup": "「思うに」 is a phrase employed to express the speaker's personal opinion or viewpoint. It is akin to saying \"in my opinion\" or \"it seems to me.\" This expression is typically used in more formal contexts, such as academic discourse, business communications, or thoughtful discussions. It conveys a sense of careful consideration and personal judgment.\n\n*   It can be placed at the beginning of a sentence to introduce a comprehensive personal view on a matter.\n*   Alternatively, it can follow a noun or phrase connected by 「を」 to signify deep reflection upon that particular topic or situation.\n*   The nuance implies that the expressed opinion is not merely a fleeting thought but one that has been carefully contemplated and is presented with a certain weight or conviction.",
