        "part-of-speech": "verb",

        "spatial-flow": "Can describe characteristics observable in a physical space or object."
    },
    "etymology": "「する」 originally means \"to do,\" but in this context, it takes on a more stative meaning, indicating a state of 'being' or 'having.' It functions as an auxiliary verb, attaching to a noun to form a descriptive meaning. This semantic extension from action to state is a common linguistic phenomenon.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「する」, most commonly known for its meaning \"to do,\" has another important usage: indicating that someone or something **possesses a certain characteristic or quality**. This is distinct from its active meaning and focuses on describing an inherent trait or attribute. It is often translated as \"to have\" in English when describing physical features, shapes, or even abstract qualities.\n\nWhile 「～がある」 can also express possession, 「～をしている」 often carries a nuance of active presence or manifestation of that attribute. It implies that the characteristic is noticeable or actively presented by the subject.\n\n**Common Applications:**\n\n*   **Physical Features:** Describing hair, eyes, body shape, etc.\n    例：彼女は長い髪をしています。(She has long hair.)\n*   **Expressions or Demeanor:** Describing how someone looks or carries themselves.\n    例：彼はいつも笑顔をしている。(He always has a smile on his face.)\n*   **Object Attributes:** Describing the shape, texture, or other qualities of inanimate objects.\n    例：この机は丸い形をしている。(This desk has a round shape.)\n*   **Abstract Qualities:** Describing intrinsic traits or dispositions.\n    例：正直な心をしている人は信頼できる。(An honest person can be trusted.)\n\nIn casual conversation, 「～している」 is often shortened to 「～してる」. When used in polite contexts, 「～しています」 is common. For very formal or respectful speech, especially when talking about a superior's characteristics or actions, the honorific passive form 「～される」 (e.g., 「～されています」) can be used, as seen in business Japanese to describe a company's stance or policy.",
