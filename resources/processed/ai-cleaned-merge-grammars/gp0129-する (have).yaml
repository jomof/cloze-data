    "etymology": "「する」 originally means \"to do,\" but in this context, it takes on a more stative meaning, indicating a state of 'being' or 'having.' It functions as an auxiliary verb, attaching to a noun to form a descriptive meaning. This semantic extension from action to state is a common linguistic phenomenon.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「する」, most commonly known for its meaning \"to do,\" has another important usage: indicating that someone or something **possesses a certain characteristic or quality**. This is distinct from its active meaning and focuses on describing an inherent trait or attribute. It is often translated as \"to have\" in English when describing physical features, shapes, or even abstract qualities.\n\nWhile 「～がある」 can also express possession, 「～をしている」 often carries a nuance of active presence or manifestation of that attribute. It implies that the characteristic is noticeable or actively presented by the subject.\n\n**Common Applications:**\n\n*   **Physical Features:** Describing hair, eyes, body shape, etc.\n*   **Expressions or Demeanor:** Describing how someone looks or carries themselves.\n*   **Object Attributes:** Describing the shape, texture, or other qualities of inanimate objects.\n*   **Abstract Qualities:** Describing intrinsic traits or dispositions.\n\nIn casual conversation, 「～している」 is often shortened to 「～してる」. When used in polite contexts, 「～しています」 is common. For very formal or respectful speech, especially when talking about a superior's characteristics or actions, the honorific passive form 「～される」 (e.g., 「～されています」) can be used, as seen in business Japanese to describe a company's stance or policy.",
