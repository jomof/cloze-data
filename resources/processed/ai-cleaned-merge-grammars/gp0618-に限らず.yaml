    "etymology": "「に限らず」is derived from 「に」 (particle), 「限る」 (kagiru - to limit), and 「ず」 (archaic negative auxiliary verb, similar to 「ない」). Literally, it means \"not limited to\".",
    "writeup": "「に限らず」 is used to express that something is \"not just (A), but (B) too\", or \"not only (A), but also (B)\". It emphasizes that the scope of something is wider than one might initially assume. It is a combination of 「に」, the verb 「限る」 (\"to limit\"), and the literary auxiliary verb 「ず」, which functions similarly to 「ない」. This structure appears after nouns, and the second part of the sentence explains what else is included in the same category as the first noun. 「も」 may be added for extra emphasis, especially when indicating multiple additional items, like \"(B) も (C) も\". Note that 「に限らず」 is more formal than 「だけでなく」.",
