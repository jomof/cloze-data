    "etymology": "「に限らず」 is derived from 「に」 (particle), 「限る」 (kagiru - to limit), and 「ず」 (an archaic negative auxiliary verb, similar to 「ない」). Literally, it means \"not limited to\".",
    "writeup": "「に限らず」 is used to express that something is \"not just (A), but (B) too\", or \"not only (A), but also (B)\". This grammar point emphasizes that the scope of something is wider than one might initially assume. It is a combination of the particle 「に」, the verb 「限る」 (\"to limit\"), and the literary auxiliary verb 「ず」, which functions similarly to 「ない」. This structure typically appears after nouns, and the subsequent part of the sentence elaborates on what else is included in the same category as the initial noun. Occasionally, 「も」 may be added for extra emphasis, particularly when indicating multiple additional elements, such as \"(B) も (C) も\".",
