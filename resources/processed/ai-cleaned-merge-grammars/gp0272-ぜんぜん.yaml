    "etymology": "全然 (ぜんぜん) is formed from the kanji 全 (ぜん, zen) meaning \"all\" or \"whole,\" repeated for emphasis. This repetition intensifies the meaning to convey a complete or total negation.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 全然 (ぜんぜん) is traditionally used with negative expressions to mean \"not at all.\" For instance, when combined with ない, it conveys complete negation. While it is grammatically expected to be used with negative forms, it is increasingly common, especially among younger speakers, to find it with positive statements, meaning \"totally\" or \"completely.\" In writing, both hiragana (ぜんぜん) and kanji (全然) are acceptable. Be aware that 全く (まったく), a similar expression, can sound more formal and sometimes carries a negative nuance, depending on tone.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「とても〜ない」 is similar, but often implies a stronger inability or impossibility than 全然."

        {
            "term": "すこしも〜ない",
            "meaning": "Not even a little, Not at all, Not in the least, Never",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「少しも〜ない」 emphasizes the lack of even a small amount, whereas 全然 focuses on the totality of negation."

        {
            "term": "全く〜ない",
            "meaning": "Not~at all",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「全く〜ない」 is a more formal synonym, and can occasionally carry a negative or displeased tone, unlike the more neutral 全然."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 全然 is generally safe for casual conversation and emphasizes totality. 全く is more formal and might imply displeasure, while expressions like とても〜ない and 少しも〜ない highlight inability or the lack of even a small amount, respectively.",
