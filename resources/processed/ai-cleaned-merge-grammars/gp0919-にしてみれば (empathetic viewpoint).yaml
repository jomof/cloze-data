formation:
  '[Noun (person or organization)] + にしてみれば': Expresses a hypothetical statement from another's point
    of view.
  '[Noun (person or organization)] + にしてみれば、[statement] だろう/でしょう/かもしれない': Used when speculating about
    the internal feelings, thoughts, or experiences of another person or group, often implying empathy

    such as だろう, でしょう, or かもしれない, reflecting the speaker's attempt to 'step into their shoes'.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to express a subjective viewpoint from someone else's perspective, often implying
    empathy or a deep consideration of their circumstances.
  function: Indicates the viewpoint or perspective of the preceding noun.
  nuance: Emphasizes that the following statement is what one might think, feel, or experience if one
    were in the shoes of the preceding noun. It implies a deeper consideration of their internal state
    or unique situation, often contrasting with other perspectives.
  grammatical-role: Functions as an adverbial phrase modifying the main clause.
  temporal-flow: Present or general truth about a perspective.
  spatial-flow: Metaphorically shifts the perspective to 'inside' another's mind or situation. A speaker
    adopts another person's position or context. This is what it would be like *if I were* in that situation.
    This is subtly different from 「にとって」, which means 'for' or 'from the standpoint of' without implying
    this deeper, 'stepping into their shoes' nuance. 「から見れば」/「からすると」 refer to how something appears from
    an external perspective.
etymology: This grammar point is derived from 「に」 (case-marking particle), 「する」 (to do) in its て-form
  「して」, and 「見る」 (to see) in its conditional ば-form 「見れば」. Literally, it means "assuming that I were (A)
  and then looking from that perspective."
writeup: |-
  「にしてみれば」, usually written entirely in hiragana, is used to express a hypothetical statement from someone else's point of view. It often translates to "from the point of view of (A), (B)," "in the case of (A), (B)," or simply "for (A), (B)." The literal meaning is akin to "assuming I were (A) and looking from there, (B).

  「にしてみれば」 follows nouns representing people or organizations that represent people. The (B) part of the phrase typically discusses how the speaker assumes the person or group would feel in a given situation. Consequently, sentences often conclude with 「だろう」, 「でしょう」, 「かもしれない」, or similar expressions, indicating speculation or uncertainty.

  This expression is typically used in a formal or semi-formal register, though it can appear in casual conversation depending on context. It indicates that the speaker is empathizing with or trying to understand the subjective internal experience of the person or group in question.

  - term: にとって
    meaning: For (A), to (A), from the standpoint of (A)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「にとって」 simply states that something is applicable or relevant to someone's situation or judgment,
      without necessarily implying a deep understanding or internal perspective. It's more about objective
      relevance. 「にしてみれば」 implies a deeper consideration of what it *would be like* if one were in that
      person's shoes, often leading to a subjective feeling or judgment from that specific viewpoint.
    grammar_point: にとって (from the standpoint of)
  - term: から見ると
    meaning: From the perspective of (A), judging from (A)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「から見れば」 and 「からすると」 emphasize an external observation or judgment made *from* a certain viewpoint,
      often leading to an objective conclusion. They imply judging a situation from a given standpoint.
      「にしてみれば」 focuses on the *internal experience* or subjective feeling of being in that person's situation,
      as if one is experiencing it themselves.
    grammar_point: から見ると (from the perspective of)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「にとって」 and 「から見れば/からすると」 can sometimes be used similarly, the key difference
  lies in the nuance of perspective. 「にしてみれば」 implies an empathetic attempt to understand the internal
  reality or feelings of the person/group, as if you are stepping into their shoes. 「にとって」 merely states
  relevance to that person without this deeper internal consideration, and 「から見れば/からすると」 denotes an observation
  or judgment made from a specific external standpoint. Choose 「にしてみれば」 when you want to highlight that
  the statement reflects what someone would genuinely feel, think, or experience if they were that person.
