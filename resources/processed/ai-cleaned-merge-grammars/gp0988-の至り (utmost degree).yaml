meaning: Utmost, height of, extreme, deepest, completely.
pronunciation:
  katakana: ノイタリ
  romaji: no itari
formation:
  Noun + の至り: Indicates the utmost or extreme level of a certain feeling or situation.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used in very stiff, formal contexts, often in speeches, writing, or when expressing profound
    emotions to superiors.
  function: Emphasizes the highest degree or peak of a specific emotion or state.
  nuance: Conveys that the preceding noun (an emotion or state) has reached its absolute maximum. It's
    highly formal and often carries a sense of profoundness, whether positive (honor, gratitude) or negative
    (shame, embarrassment). While often positive, it can also be used for negative feelings.
etymology: The grammar point 「の至り」 (no itari) originates from the noun 「至り」 (itari), meaning 'climax,'
  'pinnacle,' or 'utmost point.' The particle 「の」 (no) serves to connect the preceding noun, typically
  an emotion or state, to 「至り」, thereby indicating that the noun represents the highest or most extreme
  degree of that particular feeling or situation. It's a classical expression that highlights a peak state,
  often used in formal and literary contexts.
writeup: 「の至り」 is a deeply formal and somewhat classical expression used to convey that a certain feeling
  or state has reached its absolute peak or utmost level. It's a combination of the particle 「の」 and the
  noun 「至り」, meaning 'pinnacle' or 'climax.' This structure is typically appended to nouns that represent
  emotions or states which can be experienced in varying degrees, such as honor (光栄), gratitude (感謝),
  embarrassment (赤面), or a sense of deep obligation (恐縮). While it can be used for both positive and negative
  emotions, it always emphasizes the extreme intensity of that feeling. It is particularly common in speeches,
  formal writing, and situations where a heightened sense of formality and reverence is required. A notable
  fixed expression using this grammar point is 「若気 の 至り」 (wakage no itari), which refers to a blunder
  or ill-considered action committed due to youthful impulsiveness or immaturity.

  - term: の極み (ultimate degree)
    meaning: Utmost, extreme, height of, ultimate.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both convey an ultimate degree, 「の至り」 emphasizes emotions like gratitude and honor in
      formal contexts. 「の極み」 is broader, covering qualities and conditions beyond emotions, like 'the
      height of beauty' (美 の 極み) or 'the ultimate in luxury' (贅沢 の 極み).
    grammar_point: の極み (ultimate degree)
  - term: この上ない (utmost)
    meaning: Extreme, utterly, cannot be more, utmost.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「この上ない」 emphasizes that something is the best or most excellent of its kind, implying that
      there is nothing superior. While 「の至り」 also expresses an extreme degree, it tends to be used for
      peak emotional states or profound situations, whereas 「この上ない」 can apply more broadly to qualities
      of objects or experiences.
    grammar_point: この上ない (utmost)
  - term: といったらない (indescribable・extreme)
    meaning: Indescribable, too... for words, extremely.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「といったらない」 is used to describe something so extreme or intense that it is beyond words, often
      emphasizing a negative or overwhelming quality. While it conveys an ultimate degree like 「の至り」,
      it focuses on the unquantifiable or incommunicable nature of that extreme, rather than just the
      peak state of an emotion or situation.
    grammar_point: といったらない (indescribable・extreme)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「の至り」 and 「の極み」 convey an 'utmost' or 'extreme' degree, remember
  that 「の至り」 is particularly suited for expressing profound emotional states in very formal settings.
  Think of it when expressing deep gratitude, honor, or regret. 「の極み」 has a broader application and can
  describe the peak of qualities or conditions beyond just emotions. Similarly, 「この上ない」 emphasizes something
  being the absolute best, and 「といったらない」 highlights an extreme that is difficult to describe in words,
  each adding a distinct nuance to the concept of 'utmost degree'.
examples:
  - english: It is the utmost honor to be invited to such a grand ceremony.
    japanese:
      - この 盛大 な 式典 に ご 招待 いただき、{光栄 の 至り} で ござい ます。
      - この 盛大 な 式典 に ご 招待 賜り、{光栄 の 至り} に 存じ ます。
      - かかる 盛大 な 式典 に ご 招待 いただき、{光栄 の 至り} と 存じ ます。
    english_literally: Regarding being invited to this grand ceremony, it is the utmost honor.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 盛大 な 式典 に ご 招待 いただき、とても 光栄 です。
        english: It is a great honor to be invited to this grand ceremony.
        hint: 「とても 光栄 です」 is a common polite expression, but it does not convey the absolute peak or 'utmost'
          feeling as strongly as 「の至り」. We are looking for a phrase to emphasize the maximum degree of
          honor.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 盛大 な 式典 に ご 招待 いただき、大変 光栄 に 存じ ます。
        english: I humbly feel it is a great honor to be invited to this grand ceremony.
        hint: 「大変 光栄 に 存じ ます」 uses humble language, but it still lacks the profound 'utmost' quality that
          「の至り」 provides in very formal settings. We are looking for a phrase to emphasize the peak of
          the feeling.
    scene: A distinguished guest delivering an opening speech at a formal event.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The phrase 「光栄 の 至り」 is a highly formal expression of honor, often used in public addresses
      like speeches. The use of 「ござい ます」 further elevates the formality, indicating respect to a group
      of listeners.
  - english: Despite my inexperience, I am deeply indebted and feel the utmost obligation for your meticulous
      guidance.
    japanese:
      - 私 の 未熟 な 点 に も かかわら ず、ご 丁寧 な ご 指導 を 賜り、{恐縮 の 至り} に 存じ ます。
      - この 度 は、私 の 不 手際 に も かかわら ず、ご 配慮 いただき、{恐縮 の 至り} で ござい ます。
    english_literally: Even concerning my immaturity/inexperience, having received your careful guidance,
      I am feeling the utmost obligation.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 未熟 な 点 に も かかわら ず、ご 丁寧 な ご 指導 を 賜り、恐縮 です。
        english: Despite my inexperience, I am sorry/obliged for your meticulous guidance.
        hint: 「恐縮 です」 expresses being apologetic or obliged, but it does not convey the profound, utmost
          sense of obligation and gratitude as 「の至り」. We are looking for an expression that emphasizes
          the highest degree of obligation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 未熟 な 点 に も かかわら ず、ご 丁寧 な ご 指導 を 賜り、大変 恐縮 し て おり ます。
        english: Despite my inexperience, I am very much obliged and apologize for your meticulous guidance.
        hint: 「大変 恐縮 し て おり ます」 conveys a high level of politeness and apology, but it does not quite
          reach the intense, 'utmost' feeling of indebtedness that 「の至り」 signifies in this context. We
          are looking for a phrase that expresses the peak of this emotion.
    scene: A junior researcher bowing deeply while expressing profound gratitude and humility to their
      supervising professor after receiving detailed feedback on their work.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「恐縮 の 至り」 is used here to convey a deep sense of humble gratitude and obligation, typical
      when a subordinate is receiving invaluable help from a superior despite their own imperfections.
      The use of 「賜り」, a humble verb for receiving, and 「存じ ます」, a humble equivalent of 'to think/feel',
      reinforces the kenjōgo (humble language) register, often employed by younger individuals addressing
      older, respected figures.
  - english: Looking back on my past mistakes now, it is truly the height of embarrassment.
    japanese:
      - 過去 の 過ち を 今 振り返る と、まさに {赤面 の 至り} で ござい ます。
      - あの 時 の 無知 な 行動 は、今 思い出す と {赤面 の 至り} です。
    english_literally: When reflecting on past mistakes now, it is truly the height of embarrassment.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 過去 の 過ち を 今 振り返る と、とても 恥ずかしい です。
        english: Looking back on my past mistakes now, it is very embarrassing.
        hint: 「とても 恥ずかしい です」 is a direct and polite way to express embarrassment, but it does not convey
          the profound, overwhelming sense of shame that 「の至り」 implies. We are looking for an expression
          for the 'height' of embarrassment.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 過去 の 過ち を 今 振り返る と、大変 恥ずかしく 思い ます。
        english: Looking back on my past mistakes now, I feel very embarrassed.
        hint: While formal, 「大変 恥ずかしく 思い ます」 is a statement of personal feeling. 「赤面 の 至り」 conveys that
          the situation itself *is* the peak of embarrassment, making it more impactful for a public confession.
          We are looking for a phrase that describes the situation as embodying the utmost embarrassment.
    scene: An older business leader confessing a significant past error during a candid interview about
      their career path.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    etymology: The specific phrase 「赤面 の 至り」 directly refers to the act of one's face turning red due
      to shame or embarrassment, signifying a peak emotional state. 「赤面」 (sekimen) literally means 'red
      face', and its pairing with 「の至り」 emphasizes the extreme physiological manifestation of embarrassment.
  - english: My unplanned actions at that time can only be described as the height of youthful indiscretion.
    japanese:
      - あの 時 の 無 計画 な 行動 は、まさに {若気 の 至り} と しか 言い よう が ない。
      - あの 頃 の 軽率 な 振る舞い は、全く もっ て {若気 の 至り} でし た。
    english_literally: The unplanned actions of that time, truly, can only be described as the utmost
      of youthful impulsiveness.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時 の 無 計画 な 行動 は、若かっ た だけ です。
        english: My unplanned actions at that time were just because I was young.
        hint: 「若かった だけ です」 explains the reason but does not carry the nuanced meaning of a regrettable,
          impulsive action specifically due to youthful indiscretion that 「若気 の 至り」 conveys. We are looking
          for a fixed expression that labels such actions.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時 の 無 計画 な 行動 は、若 さ から 来る もの でし た。
        english: My unplanned actions at that time stemmed from youth.
        hint: 「若さ から 来る もの でし た」 is a neutral statement about the origin of the actions. 「若気 の 至り」 carries
          an implicit judgment that the action was ill-advised due to lack of experience, which fits the
          'unplanned actions' and 'regrettable' context more precisely. We are looking for a phrase that
          implies indiscretion.
    scene: A person jokingly explaining to a friend why they took an impulsive, regrettable trip during
      their college days.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    nuance: 「若気 の 至り」 (wakage no itari) is a fixed expression used to refer to impetuous or foolish actions
      done in one's youth. It often implies a sense of retrospect and mild regret or amusement over past
      immaturity. The casual register here fits the conversational tone when reminiscing with a friend.
  - english: I am filled with the utmost gratitude for your warm hospitality during my stay.
    japanese:
      - 御 滞在 中 の 温かい お もてなし、{感謝 の 至り} で ござい ます。

    english_literally: Regarding the warm hospitality during my stay, it is the utmost gratitude.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 度 の 温かい お もてなし、大変 感謝 し て おり ます。
        english: I am very grateful for your warm hospitality this time.
        hint: This is polite, but 「の至り」 emphasizes the *absolute peak* of gratitude. We are looking for
          a phrase that conveys the profoundest level of appreciation.
    scene: A foreign diplomat expressing sincere thanks at a farewell reception.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「感謝 の 至り」 is a highly formal and profound way to express gratitude, suitable for diplomatic
      or public settings. Using 「で ござい ます」 further reinforces this formality, emphasizing the speaker's
      deep appreciation to the hosts.

    japanese:
      - 子供 たち の 輝く 笑顔 を 見る に つけ、{喜悦 の 至り} を 感じ ます。

    english_literally: Whenever I see the children's bright smiles, I feel the utmost joy.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 たち の 笑顔 を 見る と、とても 嬉しい です。
        english: When I see the children's smiles, I am very happy.
        hint: This is a general expression of happiness. 「の至り」 suggests a profound, peak level of joy
          or delight, conveying that the joy is overwhelming.
    scene: A teacher reflecting on their students' happiness during a school event.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「喜悦 の 至り」 expresses a profound, almost overwhelming sense of joy or delight, often used when
      reflecting on something deeply moving. The phrase 「を 感じ ます」 adds to the reflective nuance, suggesting
      an internal, deep-seated emotion.
  - english: Your passionate dedication to your research is truly admirable.
    japanese:
      - 先生 の 研究 へ の 熱意 に は、まさに {感銘 の 至り} で ござい ます。

          - 先生 の 研究 へ の 熱意 に は、深く 感銘 を 受け まし た。
        english: I was deeply impressed by your passionate dedication to your research.

          implying that the dedication itself is a pinnacle of inspiration.
    scene: A student praising their professor's commitment in an academic setting.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: 「感銘 の 至り」 is used to convey an extreme level of admiration or profound impression. Here, 「先生
      の 研究 へ の 熱意 に は」 highlights the specific quality being admired, emphasizing the deep impact it has
      had on the speaker.
  - english: I sincerely apologize for causing you such inconvenience; it is truly the height of my inconsideration.
    japanese:
      - この 度 は 大変 な ご 迷惑 を お かけ し、{陳謝 の 至り} で ござい ます。
      - ご 期待 に 沿え ず、誠 に {陳謝 の 至り} に 存じ ます。
    english_literally: This time, having caused great inconvenience, it is the utmost apology.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ご 迷惑 を お かけ し、深く お 詫び 申し上げ ます。
        english: I deeply apologize for causing you inconvenience.
        hint: This is a strong apology, but 「の至り」 elevates it to an extreme, profound level of contrition,
          suggesting that the speaker's regret is absolute and overwhelming.
    scene: A business person apologizing deeply for a significant mistake during a client meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「陳謝 の 至り」 is a very formal and strong expression of apology, conveying that the speaker's
      regret has reached its maximum degree. It is often used in business or public contexts when acknowledging
      a serious mistake. The use of 「誠に」 further intensifies the sincerity of the apology.

    competing_grammar:

          - 故人 の ご 逝去 の 報 に 接し、心 より お 悔やみ 申し上げ ます。
        english: Upon learning of the deceased's passing, I offer my heartfelt condolences.
        hint: This expresses heartfelt condolences, but 「の至り」 emphasizes an *overwhelming* and profound
          sense of loss that is hard to bear, indicating the peak of sorrow.
    scene: A company spokesperson delivering a somber announcement.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「痛惜 の 至り」 conveys a deep, profound sorrow or regret, particularly for a loss or misfortune.
      The phrase 「に 堪え ませ ん」 (cannot bear) explicitly states the overwhelming nature of this sorrow, making
      it suitable for solemn public announcements. The word 「謹んで」 further adds to the respectful and somber
      tone.
  - english: It is the height of shame that I was unable to protect my companions.
    japanese:
      - 仲間 を 守る こと が でき なかっ た こと は、{慚愧 の 至り} です。

        hint: This is an everyday expression of shame. 「の至り」 conveys a deeper, more profound sense of
          self-reproach and remorse, suggesting the absolute peak of one's feeling of disgrace.
    scene: A knight regretting his failure in battle.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「慚愧 の 至り」 is a strong, formal expression of deep shame, remorse, or self-reproach, often used
      when one feels a profound personal failure or regret, especially in a context of duty or responsibility.
      It implies a high moral standard and strong internal condemnation.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 「の至り」 is consistently used to emphasize the
  absolute peak of an emotion or state. While it often appears with positive feelings like 'honor' or
  'gratitude,' it is equally effective for conveying extreme negative emotions such as 'embarrassment'
  or 'sorrow.' Its formality makes it suitable for speeches, formal writing, and solemn declarations,
  whether personal or public.
