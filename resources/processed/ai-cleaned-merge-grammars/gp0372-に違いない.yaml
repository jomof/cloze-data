    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「に」 (a particle indicating location or direction), 「違い」 (difference), and 「ない」 (not). Literally, it suggests that \"there is no difference in...\", implying a lack of doubt or uncertainty.",
    "writeup": "「に違いない」 expresses a strong degree of certainty on the part of the speaker. It means \"there is no doubt that...\" or \"I'm sure that...\". It is used when the speaker is very confident in their judgment or conclusion, often based on compelling evidence or logical reasoning. This expression can be used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns in their plain form. It is a common and useful expression for conveying strong conviction.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that 「違いない」 is a fixed expression combining the noun 「違い」 (difference) with the い-adjective 「ない」 (not). It is **not** the negative form of the verb 「違う」 (to be different), which would be 「違わない」. While 「違いない」 literally suggests 'there is no difference' (or 'discrepancy'), leading to the meaning 'there is no doubt', 「違わない」 simply means 'it is not different'. This distinction is fundamental to grasping its precise meaning and usage.\n\nFurthermore, in more formal or written Japanese, the clause preceding 「に違いない」 can be nominalized by adding 「の」. This can lend even greater credibility to the speaker's assertion, presenting the preceding statement as a concrete fact or proposition.",
