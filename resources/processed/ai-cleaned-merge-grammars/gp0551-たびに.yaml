    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たびに」 comes from the noun 「度(たび)」, meaning \"time\" or \"instance.\" The addition of the particle 「に」 creates an adverbial phrase indicating frequency or repetition, similar to how 「時(とき)に」 (at times) or 「場合(ばあい)に」 (in cases of) are formed. Historically, 「度」 has been used to denote recurrence or occasions.",
    "writeup": "「たびに」 is a fundamental grammatical structure used to express that a particular action or event takes place **every time** a specific condition or preceding action occurs. It signifies a consistent consequence or accompaniment to a recurring action, creating a strong cause-and-effect relationship between the two.\n\nThis phrase can attach to verbs in their plain, non-past (dictionary) form, such as 「行(い)くたびに」 (every time I go), or to nouns followed by the possessive particle 「の」, as in 「旅行(りょこう)のたびに」 (every time I travel).\n\nWhile conceptually similar to 「ごとに」, 「たびに」 particularly emphasizes the notion of \"every time (one does something).\" It highlights a direct, predictable link between the repeated action and the subsequent event or result. Consequently, 「たびに」 is almost exclusively used to describe dynamic actions or concrete events, rather than just arbitrary instances in time or static occurrences. For example, you would use 「たびに」 to describe \"every time I read this book, I discover something new,\" emphasizing the action of reading and its direct outcome.\n\nIt's worth noting that in casual conversation, 「たびに」 is often pronounced as 「たんびに」.",
