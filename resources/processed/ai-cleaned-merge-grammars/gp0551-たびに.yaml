    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たびに」 comes from the noun 「度(たび)」, meaning \"time\" or \"instance.\" The addition of the particle 「に」 creates an adverbial phrase indicating frequency or repetition.",
    "writeup": "「たびに」 is a grammatical structure used to express that something occurs **every time** a particular action or event takes place. It signifies a consistent consequence or accompaniment to a recurring action. While conceptually similar to 「ごとに」, 「たびに」 particularly emphasizes the notion of \"**every time (one does something)**,\" highlighting a direct link between the repeated action and the subsequent event. Therefore, 「たびに」 is almost exclusively used to describe actions or concrete events, rather than arbitrary instances in time. It attaches to verbs in their dictionary form, or to nouns followed by the possessive particle 「の」.",
