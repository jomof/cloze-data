    "etymology": "「面」 (men) originally refers to the surface or face of something. In this grammatical context, it's used metaphorically to refer to a particular side or aspect of a subject.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「面」 (men) is attached to nouns to indicate a specific aspect, side, or viewpoint. It's used to focus on one particular element of a larger topic. For example, 「安全面」 (anzenmen) means \"the safety aspect,\" and 「経済面」 (keizaimen) means \"the economic aspect.\" It is similar to 「〜の点から」 but more concise, often used when discussing an entire dimension of something rather than just a specific point.",
