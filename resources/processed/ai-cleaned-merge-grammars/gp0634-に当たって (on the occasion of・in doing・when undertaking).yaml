meaning: When undertaking a significant action or on the occasion of an important event
pronunciation:
  katakana: ニ アタッテ
  romaji: ni atatte
formation:
  Noun + に当たって: Used when describing an action taken or state existing at the time of a significant event
    or new phase.
  Verb[dictionary form] + に当たって: Used when describing an action taken or state existing at the time of
    undertaking a significant action.
jlpt: N2
etymology: The phrase 「に当たって」 is formed from the particle 「に」 (ni), which indicates a point in time or
  a specific situation, and the verb 「当たる」 (ataru), meaning "to hit," "to strike," or "to face." In this
  context, 「当たる」 takes on the meaning of "to be confronted with" or "to be at the moment of." Therefore,
  「に当たって」 signifies being at a specific, often crucial or important, juncture, suggesting the active facing
  or undertaking of an event or action.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「に当たって」 is used to describe an action or state that occurs **at the time of** or **when undertaking** a significant, often formal, event or action. It carries a nuance of facing a new phase, a new challenge, or an important occasion, often implying a need for preparation, resolve, or a sense of gravity regarding the moment.

  This expression is typically used for events that are formal, ceremonial, or represent a major turning point, such as starting a new business, giving a speech at a public event, graduating, or facing a significant decision. It emphasizes the importance of the moment and the actions or mindset associated with it.

  It is more formal than a simple 「とき」 (when) and suggests a more active engagement or facing of the situation compared to 「際に」 (on the occasion of), which can be used for more general or less 'undertaking'-focused occasions. While 「にあたり」 has a very similar meaning, 「に当たって」 is slightly more common in general formal speech and writing, whereas 「にあたり」 tends to be more literary or used in very stiff, formal announcements.

  - term: 際に
    meaning: on the occasion of, at the time of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「際に」 is also formal and means "at the time of," it is more general. 「に当たって」 specifically
      implies undertaking something significant or facing a new stage, often with a sense of preparation
      or resolve. 「際に」 lacks this specific emphasis on initiation or confrontation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:際に・折に・に当たって・に際して (on the occasion of・when)
  - term: とき
    meaning: when
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とき」 is the most general term for "when" and can be used in any context, from casual to formal.
      It does not carry any specific nuance of importance, formality, or active undertaking that 「に当たって」
      does.
    grammar_point: とき (when)
  - term: にあたり
    meaning: on the occasion of, upon
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にあたり」 is very close in meaning and usage to 「に当たって」, but it is often considered even more
      formal and literary. It is frequently seen in written announcements or very ceremonial speeches,
      possibly less common in everyday formal conversation compared to 「に当たって」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:にあたり (on the occasion of, upon)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate these expressions, consider the level of formality and the
  nuance of "undertaking" or "facing a new stage." Use 「に当たって」 when the moment is significant and involves
  a new beginning or a major task. Use 「際に」 for more general formal occasions. Reserve 「とき」 for everyday
  situations. While 「にあたり」 is very similar to 「に当たって」, its use tends to be more restricted to highly formal
  or written contexts.
