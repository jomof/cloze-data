    "etymology": "「みたい」is believed to be derived from 「見たような」 (mita yō na), literally \"like I saw.\" The 「よう」 itself implies a likeness or resemblance, and over time, 「見たような」 was shortened to 「みたい」.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「みたい」 expresses that something is 'like' or 'similar to' something else. It indicates a resemblance based on direct or reliable information, often visual. It's a conversational alternative to 「ようだ」, being less formal.\n\nWhen used to describe a noun, 「みたい」 requires 「な」. For example, 「子供みたいな人」 (kodomo mitai na hito) means \"a person like a child.\" At the end of a statement, 「みたいだ」 or 「みたいです」 is used, but the 「だ」 is frequently omitted in casual speech. Unlike 見たい 'to want to see', みたい itself doesn't have a kanji form, which sometimes confuses learners.",

Using these distinctions, you can better convey the nuance you intend."
