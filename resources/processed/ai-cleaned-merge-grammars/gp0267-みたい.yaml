    "etymology": "「みたい」is believed to be derived from 「見たような」 (mita yō na), literally \"like I saw.\" The 「よう」 itself implies a likeness or resemblance, and over time, 「見たような」 was shortened to 「みたい」.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「みたい」 expresses that something is 'like' or 'similar to' something else. It indicates a resemblance based on direct and reliable information, often visual. When used to describe a noun, 「みたい」 requires 「な」, forming patterns such as 「〜みたいな人」. At the end of a statement, 「みたいだ」 or 「みたいです」 is used, though the 「だ」 is frequently omitted in casual speech. It is crucial not to confuse 「みたい」 with 「見たい」 (mitai), meaning 'to want to see', as 「みたい」 itself does not have a kanji form. The auxiliary 「みたい」 can attach to the plain form of verbs, い-adjectives, and to the stem of な-adjectives and nouns.",
