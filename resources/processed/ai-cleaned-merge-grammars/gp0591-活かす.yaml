        "[Noun] を + 活かす": "To make use of, take advantage of, or leverage something (skill, experience, attribute, etc.)."
    },
    "jlpt": "N2",
    "meaning": "To make use of (something), to take full advantage of, to capitalize on, to leverage (skills), bring out (the quality of).",

    "writeup": "活かす means \"to make use of\" something. When partnered with a noun using the particle を, it indicates that something is being made good use of or leveraged. This can apply to skills, experiences, attributes, and many other things.\n\nThis grammar point can appear as either the う-Verb 活かす 'to enliven' or 生かす 'to keep alive,' with very little change in nuance. However, 活かす tends to appear far more frequently because its focus is less on the preservation of life and more on simply 'making good use' of something. When linked to a noun to show that something 'has' been made good use of, 活かす will appear in the past tense.\n\n**Important Consideration**: 活かす is often used with adverbs of amount or quality to highlight how well something is being made good use of or capitalized on. Examples include:\n*   十分に (juubun ni): adequately, fully\n*   有効に (yuukou ni): effectively\n*   最大限に (saidai gen ni): to the fullest",
    "etymology": "活(い) (iki) means \"life, activity\" and かす (-kasu) is a verb suffix meaning \"to make, to turn something into\". Therefore, 活かす (ikasu) literally translates to \"to make alive\" or \"to bring to life,\" which then evolved to mean \"to make use of\" or \"to leverage\".",
