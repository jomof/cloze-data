It shares a root with 「生きる」 (ikiru, \"to live\"), emphasizing the idea of animating or making something vibrant and useful.",
    "writeup": "「活かす」 (ikasu) means \"to make use of something,\" \"to take full advantage of,\" or \"to capitalize on.\" It emphasizes leveraging skills, experiences, or attributes. The kanji 「活」 focuses less on preserving life (as with 「生かす」) and more on making good use of something. Adverbs like 「十分に」 (jūbun ni, \"adequately\"), 「有効に」 (yūkō ni, \"effectively\"), and 「最大限に」 (saidai gen ni, \"to the fullest\") often accompany 「活かす」 to highlight the degree to which something is being utilized.",
