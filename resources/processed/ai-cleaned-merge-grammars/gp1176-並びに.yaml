        "Usage": "Used in formal writing and speech. Often seen in legal documents, official announcements, and academic papers.",
        "Alternatives": "More casual alternatives include 「と」 and 「そして」.",

It is similar to \"and\" or \"as well as\" in English, but it carries a more sophisticated and official tone. You'll most often encounter 「並びに」 in legal documents, formal announcements, and academic writing. It suggests that the items being connected are of equal importance. 「並びに」 implies a stronger connection than a simple 「と」.",
