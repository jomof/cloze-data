        "usage-context": "Used in formal writing and speech; often seen in legal documents, official announcements, and academic papers.",

    "etymology": "「並びに」 comes from the verb 「並ぶ(ならぶ)」, meaning \"to line up\" or \"to be side by side.\" It suggests that the items being connected are of equal standing and importance, arranged side-by-side.",
    "writeup": "「並びに」 is a formal conjunction used to connect two or more nouns or noun phrases. It is similar to \"and\" or \"as well as\" in English, but it carries a more sophisticated and official tone. You'll most often encounter 「並びに」 in legal documents, formal announcements, and academic writing. It suggests that the items being connected are of equal importance. 「並びに」 implies a stronger connection than a simple 「と」. While it connects elements of equal importance, it tends to be used for larger, more complex items or categories than 「及び」. Think of it as connecting primary groupings or significant entities.",
