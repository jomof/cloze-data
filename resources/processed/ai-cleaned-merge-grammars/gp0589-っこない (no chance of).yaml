    "etymology": "「っこない」 is a compound expression consisting of the suffix 「っこ」 and the negative auxiliary 「ない」. The suffix 「っこ」 is derived from 「子 (ko)」, meaning 'child', and is used to denote smallness or familiarity. In this context, it takes on an intensifying role, adding emphasis to the negation. When combined with 「ない」, it creates a colloquial and emphatic form of impossibility, stressing that 'not even a little bit' or 'absolutely not' can something occur. While grammatically it functions like an い-adjective, its origin is more complex, having evolved from these distinct elements to form a strong assertive negative.",
    "writeup": "The grammatical expression 「っこない」 is used to convey a strong sense of impossibility or inevitability that something will not happen. It attaches to the **ます-stem** (conjunctive form) of verbs and functions syntactically like an い-adjective. Its meaning is akin to \"there is no way,\" \"it's impossible,\" or \"there's no chance.\" It is a direct and forceful negation, often employed in casual conversation.\n\nWhile 「っこない」 generally functions as an auxiliary adjective, it is important to remember its base is a verb's ます-stem. It can be conjugated to express past tense (e.g., 「っこなかった」) or used in the て-form (e.g., 「っこなくて」).\n\nThis expression carries a strong, somewhat colloquial tone, making it most suitable for casual or informal settings. It implies the speaker's firm conviction regarding the impossibility, rather than a mere low probability. It is common across various age groups, particularly in informal interactions.",
