    "etymology": "The word 「およそ」can be traced back to the idea of 「凡」, meaning common or ordinary. The prefix 「大」 (おお) can be added for emphasis, making 「おおよそ」. Thus, it conveys the sense of something being within the realm of the ordinary or general, hence its usage for approximation.",
    "writeup": "「およそ」 or 「おおよそ」, written as 「凡そ」 or 「大凡」, is an adverb that translates to \"approximately\" or \"roughly.\" It is primarily used in formal contexts and is often heard in announcements. As an adverb, it modifies time, distance, or quantity, often appearing at the beginning of sentences to set the scope. 「およそ」 can also mean \"generally\" or \"commonly,\" indicating something largely applies but isn't always the case. It is used to give an estimate or general idea, rather than an exact number.",
