        "usage-context": "Used for numerical approximation (time, distance, quantity), indicating a general truth or 'for the most part', and with negation to mean 'not at all'. Primarily used in slightly more formal contexts, such as official announcements, but can also appear in casual speech for approximations.",
        "nuance": "While およそ and おおよそ are often interchangeable, およそ can also convey the nuance of 'not at all' when used with negative expressions, a usage less common for おおよそ.",

    },
    "etymology": "In the kanji 「凡そ」, the character 「凡」 (bon) signifies 'commonplace' or 'ordinary', hinting at its meaning of 'generally' or 'as a rule'. In 「大凡」, the character 「大」 (dai) implies 'large' or 'great', extending to 'roughly' or 'approximately'. Both expressions convey a sense of 'generally' or 'for the most part' from their respective etymological roots.",
    "writeup": "「およそ」 or 「おおよそ」, alternatively written as 凡そ or 大凡, is a versatile adverb. It can mean **approximately**, **roughly**, **generally**, **mostly**, and when combined with negation, **not at all**. It is frequently encountered in slightly more formal contexts, such as official announcements, but also appears in casual conversation, especially for approximations. Both forms are largely interchangeable, though there are subtle differences in nuance.\n\nWhen used for numerical estimations, 「およそ」 and 「おおよそ」 function similarly to 'about' or 'approximately' in English, applying to quantities, time, or distance. For example, one might say 「およそ３時間」 (approximately 3 hours) or 「おおよそ１０キロ」 (roughly 10 kilometers).\n\nBeyond numbers, 「およそ」 (often written as 凡そ for this meaning) can convey a sense of generality or 'for the most part'. This usage suggests that something broadly applies, though it may not be true 100% of the time. It implies a common rule or general truth.\n\nA key distinction lies in its use with negative expressions. When paired with a negative verb or adjective, 「およそ」 takes on a strong emphatic meaning, translating to **not at all** or **completely unsuited**. This particular nuance is more commonly associated with 「およそ」 than 「おおよそ」, which tends to be restricted more strictly to approximation. For instance, 「およそ理解できない」 means 'cannot understand at all' or 'it is completely incomprehensible'.",
