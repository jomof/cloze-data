        "Register": "Slightly formal contexts, announcements. Can be used casually.",
        "Usage": "Used for numerical approximation (time, distance, quantity), indicating a general truth or 'for the most part', and with negation to mean 'not at all'.",
        "Note": "Can be written as 凡そ (primarily used when meaning 'generally' or 'as a rule') or 大凡 (more commonly used when meaning 'approximately' or 'roughly').",

    },
    "etymology": "「凡そ」の「凡」は「ありふれた」という意味で、「大凡」の「大」は「だいたい」という意味を持ちます。どちらも「おおむね」「だいたい」という意味合いで使われます。In 「凡そ」, the kanji 「凡」 means commonplace. In 「大凡」, the kanji 「大」means roughly. Both convey the sense of 'generally' or 'approximately'.",
    "writeup": "「およそ」 or 「おおよそ」, alternatively written as 凡そ or 大凡, is an adverb with versatile meanings including **approximately**, **roughly**, **generally**, **mostly**, and when used with negation, **not at all**. It is typically found in slightly more formal contexts, such as official announcements, but can also appear in casual speech, particularly for approximations. \n\nIts usage extends beyond mere numerical estimations (time, distance, quantity). 「凡そ」 often conveys a sense of generality or 'for the most part', as hinted by its kanji 凡, which means 'commonplace' or 'as a rule'. For instance, it can indicate that something broadly applies, though not necessarily 100% of the time. \n\nFurthermore, when paired with negative expressions, 「およそ」 takes on a strong prohibitive or emphatic meaning, translating to **not at all** or **completely unsuited**. This specific nuance is more commonly associated with 「およそ」 than 「おおよそ」, which tends to stick more strictly to approximation.",
