    "etymology": "「つまり (tsumari)」 originates from the verb 「詰まる (tsumaru)」, which means \"to be packed,\" \"to be blocked,\" or \"to be condensed.\" In its adverbial usage, 「つまり」 retains this core meaning, signifying the act of condensing or summarizing a preceding statement to its essence. It implies that what follows is the concise core or the logical conclusion of what was just said.",
    "writeup": "「つまり」 is an adverb used to summarize, clarify, or rephrase a previous statement. It functions much like \"in short,\" \"in other words,\" or \"to sum up\" in English. This expression allows the speaker to concisely present the essence or the logical conclusion of what has been stated, whether by themselves or by someone else. It is a fundamental tool for ensuring clarity and driving a conversation towards a succinct understanding.",
