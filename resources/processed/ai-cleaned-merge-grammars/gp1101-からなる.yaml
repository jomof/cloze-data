It is often translated as \"to consist of\" or \"to be composed of.\" This expression emphasizes the inherent or stable components that make up a whole entity.\n\nIt is typically used in more formal or academic contexts to describe the structure, elements, or constituents of a subject. While similar in meaning to 「でできている」, 「からなる」 specifically highlights that the subject is formed *from* distinct components, rather than merely being made *of* a certain material. For instance, a committee `からなる` from members, but a table `でできている` of wood.\n\nThe most common forms are 「からなる」 (dictionary form) and 「からなっている」 (present progressive form), with the latter emphasizing the current state of composition. When listing multiple components, they are often connected by 「と」 (and). This grammar point can also be used attributively before a noun, as in 「〜からなるチーム」 (a team consisting of 〜).",
