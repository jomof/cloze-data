formation:
  疑問詞 (Interrogative word) 「誰」 (who) + 助詞 (Particle) 「か」: Forms an indefinite pronoun referring to an
    unspecified person.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The word 「誰か」 is formed by combining the interrogative pronoun 「誰」 (dare), meaning "who," with
  the particle 「か」 (ka), which typically forms questions. In this context, 「か」 functions to make the pronoun
  indefinite, transforming "who?" into "someone" or "somebody." This grammatical construction is a common
  way in Japanese to express indefiniteness by adding 「か」 to interrogative words (e.g., いつか "sometime,"
  どこか "somewhere," なにか "something").
writeup: |-
  「誰か」 (dareka) is an indefinite pronoun in Japanese that means "someone" or "somebody." It refers to an unspecified person, implying that the speaker does not know who the person is, or does not need to specify them. It is commonly used in affirmative sentences where the existence of a person is confirmed, but their identity is unknown.

  While 「誰か」 acts as an indefinite pronoun, it shares its root with the interrogative 「誰」 (dare), which means "who?" or "whom?" The addition of the particle 「か」 removes the interrogative nature and makes it indefinite. This is similar to how "what" becomes "something" in English.

  「誰か」 can function as the subject, object, or part of a phrase depending on the particles attached to it. For example, 「誰か が 来た」 (someone came), 「誰か を 探している」 (I'm looking for someone), or 「誰か に 聞いて みよう」 (Let's try asking someone).

  - term: 誰 (who)
    meaning: who; whom
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「誰」 is an interrogative pronoun used specifically to ask "who?". 「誰か」, on the other hand,
      refers to an *unspecified* person in an affirmative or uncertain context. For example, 「誰 ですか？」
      (Who is it?) vs. 「誰か がいます」 (Someone is here). We're looking for an unknown person, not asking for
      an identity.
    grammar_point: 誰 (who)
  - term: 誰でも (anyone・everyone)
    meaning: anyone; everyone (without exception)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「誰でも」 emphasizes inclusivity or universality, meaning 'anyone at all' or 'everyone'. 「誰か」
      refers to 'someone' specific but unknown. For instance, 「誰でも できる」 (Anyone can do it) suggests that
      there are no restrictions, whereas 「誰か できる？」 (Can someone do it?) implies looking for an individual
      among many.
    grammar_point: 誰でも (anyone・everyone)
  - term: 何か (something)
    meaning: something; anything
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 「誰か」 and 「何か」 follow the pattern of interrogative + 「か」, but 「何か」 refers to an unspecified
      *thing* (e.g., 「何か 食べたい」 - I want to eat something), while 「誰か」 refers to an unspecified *person*.
      We're looking for a person, not a thing.
    grammar_point: なにか・なにも (something or nothing)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between 「誰か」, 「誰」, 「誰でも」, and 「何か」, focus on their specific
  functions. 「誰」 is for direct questions about identity. 「誰か」 is for referring to an unknown individual
  in a positive or uncertain statement. 「誰でも」 is for expressing universal applicability or inclusivity.
  Finally, 「何か」 is for unknown objects or concepts, similar to 「誰か」 but for non-human entities.

post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「誰か」 consistently points to the idea of an 'unknown
  person' or 'somebody.' Its strength lies in its ability to introduce a person into a sentence without
  requiring identification, making it useful for general statements, requests, or observations.
