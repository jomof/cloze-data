    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「んだって」 is a combination of 「ん」 (a shortened form of 「の」 used to provide explanation), 「だ」 (the copula 'to be,' indicating assertion), and 「って」 (a colloquial abbreviation of 「と言って」, meaning 'said'). Thus, it literally translates to 'it is that (A) was said'.",
    "writeup": "「んだって」 is used at the end of sentences to express information the speaker has heard from someone else. It's a casual way of saying \"I heard that...\" or \"Someone said that...\". Because 「んだって」 is quite casual, it's best used in conversations with friends or people you're close to. It is often used in informal conversation to pass along information without necessarily vouching for its accuracy.",

            "term": "って (quotation)",
            "meaning": "Casual quotation",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「って」 can also indicate reported speech, it's often a direct or near-direct quote, whereas 「んだって」 is a more general hearsay or simply relaying information."

        {
            "term": "とか",

            "kind": "similar expression",

            "term": "らしい ①",
            "meaning": "Seems like, Apparently, I heard",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「らしい」 indicates the speaker's deduction based on evidence or general consensus, not necessarily direct hearsay. 「んだって」 specifically means you heard the information."

            "nuance": "「だって」 on its own has multiple meanings, including 'because' or 'but,' and is often used as a conversational filler or to express mild protest. 「んだって」 is specifically for reporting hearsay, combining the explanatory 「ん」 with 「だって」."
