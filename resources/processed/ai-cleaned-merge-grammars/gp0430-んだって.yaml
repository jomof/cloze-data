    "etymology": "The grammar point 「んだって」is a combination of 「ん」 (a shortened form of 「の」 used to provide explanation), 「だ」 (the copula 'to be,' indicating assertion), and 「って」 (a colloquial abbreviation of 「と言って」, meaning 'said'). Thus, it literally translates to 'it is that (A) was said'.",
    "writeup": "「んだって」 is used at the end of sentences to express information the speaker has heard from someone else. It's a casual way of saying \"I heard that...\" or \"Someone said that...\". Because 「んだって」 is quite casual, it's best used in conversations with friends or people you're close to. It is often used in informal conversation to pass along information without necessarily vouching for its accuracy.",
