    "etymology": "The particle 「こそ」 adds emphasis to the preceding word or phrase. When combined with 「から」 (because), it creates 「からこそ」, emphasizing the specific reason or cause being stated.",

It is similar to saying \"precisely because (A), (B)\" in English. It's used after verbs in their plain form or nouns followed by 「だ」. While there may be multiple reasons for a situation, 「からこそ」 highlights the most important or primary one.",
