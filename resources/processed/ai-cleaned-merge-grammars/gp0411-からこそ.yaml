    "etymology": "The particle 「こそ」 adds emphasis to the preceding word or phrase. When combined with 「から」 (because), it creates 「からこそ」, emphasizing the specific reason or cause being stated.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「からこそ」 is used to emphasize the reason or cause for something. It conveys that something is true **precisely because** of a particular reason. It is similar to saying \"precisely because (A), (B)\" in English. It's used after verbs in their plain form or nouns followed by 「だ」. While there may be multiple reasons for a situation, 「からこそ」 highlights the most important or primary one.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「からこそ」 shares similar meanings with other expressions like 「から」, 「ものだから」, 「ことだから」, 「～てこそ」, 「こそ」, 「あまり」 and 「～ばこそ」, it's crucial to remember that 「からこそ」 is used to **emphasize** a specific reason or cause. Other expressions may provide reasons or conditions, but lack the specific emphasis that 「からこそ」 provides. 「～ばこそ」 is very similar, but it has a different register.
