jlpt: N4
etymology: The structure 「ではなくて・じゃなくて」 is derived from the negative copulas 「ではない」 (formal) and 「じゃない」
  (casual), both meaning 'is not'. The 「て」 ending is the te-form (conjunctive form) of the auxiliary verb
  「ない」, allowing the negated clause to connect to a subsequent clause that presents a correction or alternative.
  Thus, it literally means 'being not A, and B'.
writeup: |-
  The grammatical pattern 「ではなくて・じゃなくて」 is used to make corrections or provide clarification by negating a preceding noun or な-adjective and then introducing the correct information. It essentially conveys 'it's not X, but Y' or 'rather than X, it's Y'.

  「ではなくて」 is the more formal or neutral form, suitable for polite conversation, business settings, or written communication. 「じゃなくて」 is its casual counterpart, frequently used in everyday speech among friends, family, or close acquaintances.

  This pattern is highly effective for clarifying misunderstandings or specifying precise details. It's often used when someone has made an assumption or stated something incorrectly, and you wish to politely (or casually) set the record straight. It always implies a direct contrast between the negated element and the affirmed one.

  While the primary use is for nouns and な-adjectives, it can sometimes implicitly connect to a verb phrase, where the negation of a state or action is followed by a different state or action. However, its most direct application is for noun and な-adjective corrections.
false_friends:
  - term: じゃない (negation noun and na-adj)
    meaning: is not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「じゃない」 simply negates a noun or な-adjective as a predicate. It ends a sentence or clause and
      does not inherently connect to another contrasting element. 「じゃなくて」 negates the preceding element
      and connects it to a contrasting element, making it 'not A, but B'.
    grammar_point: な-Adjective[ではない・じゃない] (plain negative)
  - term: ではない (formal negative copula)
    meaning: is not (formal)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ではない」 is a formal negation of a noun or な-adjective. Like 「じゃない」, it acts as a predicate
      and does not directly introduce a contrasting element within the same sentence. 「ではなくて」 explicitly
      connects the negated part to the correction.
    grammar_point: ではない (formal negative copula)
  - term: なくてはいけない・なくちゃ (must do・have to)
    meaning: must do, have to do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「なくてはいけない」 uses 「なくて」 as part of a fixed phrase indicating obligation, meaning 'must not be
      without' or 'must do'. It does not express 'not A, but B'. The meaning is completely different,
      conveying necessity rather than correction.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜なくてはいけない・なくちゃ (must do・have to)
  - term: Verb[なくて] (negative te-form)
    meaning: not doing; without doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「なくて」 is the te-form of the negative auxiliary 「ない」 and can be used for various connections,
      its use in 「ではないくて・じゃなくて」 is specific to negating nouns or な-adjectives and linking to a correction.
      On its own, 「なくて」 usually means 'without doing [verb]' or 'because [verb] was not done'.
    grammar_point: Verb[なくて] (negative te-form)
  - term: ではなく (not A, but B, formal, non-te)
    meaning: not A, but B (formal, connecting)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ではなく」 serves a similar corrective function but is a slightly more formal or literary connective
      than 「ではなくて」. It tends to be used when listing or contrasting two items or ideas concisely, often
      within a single phrase, whereas 「ではなくて」 can connect fuller clauses.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ではなく (not A, but B, formal, non-te)
  - term: じゃなく (not A, but B, casual, non-te)
    meaning: not A, but B (casual, connecting)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「ではなく」, 「じゃなく」 is a casual form that provides a concise 'not A, but B' connection.
      It's often used when the second element directly replaces or clarifies the first, rather than connecting
      two distinct clauses.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:じゃなく (not A, but B, casual, non-te)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「ではなくて・じゃなくて」 from simpler negations like 「じゃない」 or 「ではない」,
  remember that the latter merely state a negation without necessarily implying a follow-up correction
  or alternative. The 「〜くて」 form in our grammar point explicitly signals that the negated information
  is being replaced or clarified by what follows. Furthermore, don't confuse it with the fixed phrase
  「〜なくてはいけない」, which indicates obligation or necessity, having no relation to expressing 'not A, but B'.
  The non-te forms 「ではなく・じゃなく」 are often more concise and used for listing or direct replacement within
  a single phrase, whereas the 「〜くて」 forms can connect more elaborate contrasting clauses.
