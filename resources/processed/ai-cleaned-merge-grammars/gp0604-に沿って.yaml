    "writeup": "「に沿って」 expresses that something is done \"along with (A),\" \"in accordance with (A),\" or \"in line with (A).\" It's often used with rules, laws, guidelines, or paths. The nuance is that (A) is the controlling factor, and (B) is done with consideration for it. When used literally, it means following a path or street.",
