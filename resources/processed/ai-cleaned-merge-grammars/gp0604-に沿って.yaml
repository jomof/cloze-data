    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に沿って」 comes from the verb 「沿う (そう)」, meaning \"to run along, follow\". The 「て」-form indicates a state or manner of following. Thus, 「に沿って」 literally means \"following along with\" something.",
    "writeup": "「に沿って」 expresses that something is done \"along with (A),\" \"in accordance with (A),\" or \"in line with (A).\" It's often used with rules, laws, guidelines, or paths. The nuance is that (A) is the controlling factor, and (B) is done with consideration for it. When used literally, it means following a path or street. While this grammar structure is relatively formal, when literally meaning 'alongside', it will be used fairly frequently.",
