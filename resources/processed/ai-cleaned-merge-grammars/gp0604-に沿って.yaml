    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に沿って」 comes from the verb 「沿う (そう)」, meaning \"to run along, follow\". The 「て」-form indicates a state or manner of following. Thus, 「に沿って」 literally means \"following along with\" something.",
    "writeup": "「に沿って」 expresses that something is done by following \"along with\" (A), \"in accordance with\" (A), or \"in line with\" (A). It is frequently used with rules, laws, guidelines, plans, or physical paths. The core nuance is that (A) serves as the controlling factor, and (B) is performed with that consideration in mind.\n\nWhile typically seen in its て-form as 「に沿って」, the verb 「沿う」 can also appear in its dictionary form when it directly modifies a subsequent noun. For example, 「希望に沿う商品」 (a product that is in line with expectations). This construction functions adjectivally, describing the noun as something that conforms to or follows a particular standard or concept.\n\nAs the base meaning of 「沿う」 is \"to follow along,\" it is also commonly used in a literal sense to describe moving along a specific path or street. Though the grammar structure generally conveys a sense of formality, its literal usage for physical alignment is quite common in everyday conversation.",
