jlpt: N5
etymology: The origin of the suffix 「たい」 is believed to come from the older auxiliary verb 「たし」, which
  expressed desire. Over time, 「たし」 evolved phonetically and grammatically, eventually becoming the modern
  「たい」 that attaches to the ます-stem of verbs. Its core meaning of expressing a strong personal desire
  has remained consistent throughout its development.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「〜たい」 expresses the speaker's desire to perform an action. It attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. For example, 食べる (taberu, to eat) becomes 食べたい (tabetai, want to eat). It is crucial to understand that 「〜たい」 is primarily used for the first person (I/we) or when asking about the second person's (you) desire. For example, 「私は寿司を食べたいです」 (I want to eat sushi) or 「あなたは寿司が食べたいですか？」 (Do you want to eat sushi?).

  「〜たい」 conjugates just like an い-adjective. This means its negative form is 「たくない」 (e.g., 食べたくない - don't want to eat), its past form is 「たかった」 (e.g., 食べたかった - wanted to eat), and its past negative form is 「たくなかった」 (e.g., 食べたくなかった - didn't want to eat). It can also form the て-form: 「たくなって」, or conditional forms like 「たければ」 or 「たかったら」.

  When expressing the desire of a third person (he/she/they), you generally use 「〜たがる」 (e.g., 彼は寿司を食べたがっています - He wants to eat sushi). Using 「〜たい」 for a third person's desire is typically considered grammatically incorrect, unless it's a rhetorical question or a very specific context where you are empathizing or assuming their feelings.

  This form is versatile and fundamental for expressing personal wishes in Japanese. It's used across various registers, from casual to polite, depending on the politeness level of the auxiliary verb (e.g., たいです, たい).

  - term: Nounが欲しい
    meaning: want (an object)

      definite intention or plan.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[dictionary]つもりだ (to intend to)
  - term: Verb[て]ほしい
    meaning: want someone to do (for you)

    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て]ほしい (to want someone to do)
  - term: Verb[ます-stem]たがる
    meaning: (someone) wants to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜たい」 is used for the speaker's (first person) desire, or to ask about the listener's (second
      person) desire. 「〜たがる」 is used for a third person's desire.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[ます-stem]たがる (someone wants to do)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'It''s important to distinguish between wanting to do something yourself (〜たい),
  wanting someone else to do something (〜てほしい), and wanting an object (〜欲しい). Also, remember the key difference
  in perspective: 〜たい is for your own desires, while 〜たがる is used when describing someone else''s desires.'

          - 弟 は ゲーム を し たい です。
        english: My little brother wants to play games. (Sounds like speaker knows his desire directly)
        hint: When talking about a third person's desire, the '〜たがる' form is generally used, as we infer
          their desire from observation.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male

      behavior or statements. This form is necessary when talking about someone else's desire, as directly
      using 「〜たい」 for a third person would sound odd, implying you can read their mind.

post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in the examples, the versatility of 「〜たい」 allows it to express a
  wide range of personal desires and wishes. Pay close attention to the distinction between first/second-person
  usage of 「〜たい」 and third-person usage of 「〜たがる」 to ensure natural and accurate communication.
