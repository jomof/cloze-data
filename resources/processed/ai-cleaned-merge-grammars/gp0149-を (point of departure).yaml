        "Function": "Marks the location from which someone or something departs or separates.",
        "Register": "Neutral; appropriate for various contexts.",
        "Related Expression": "Similar to 「から」 in indicating origin, but 「を」 focuses specifically on the act of leaving.",

    "etymology": "The particle 「を」 originally served as a marker for direct objects. Over time, its usage expanded to include marking the point of departure, likely evolving from the sense of 'passing through' a location.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「を」, in this context, indicates the location from which a movement or action originates. It is used with verbs that express departure, leaving, or separating. Think of it as tracing the path *away from* a specific place. While similar to 「から」, 「を」 emphasizes the act of leaving a place, rather than just the origin point. For example, 「家**を**出る」 means \"to leave the house,\" focusing on the action of exiting. Note that the kanji を is rarely used, except in literary contexts.",
