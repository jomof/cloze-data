    "etymology": "The verb 「切る(kiru)」 normally means \"to cut.\" However, when attached to the stem of another verb, it takes on a meaning of doing something \"completely\" or \"to the end.\" The nuance often implies that something has been used up or exhausted in the process.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「切る(kiru)」, which normally means \"to cut,\" also functions as an auxiliary verb. When attached to the **ます-stem** of another verb, it indicates that the action of that verb is done **completely** or **to the limit**. This often carries a nuance of using up some kind of resource, such as energy or supplies. Therefore, it can be translated as \"to do (A) to the point of being unable to continue,\" or \"to totally and utterly do (A).\" In some cases, it may suggest that (A) is being done with full effort or capacity, implying \"to resolutely do (A)\" or \"to do (A) at full pelt.\"",
