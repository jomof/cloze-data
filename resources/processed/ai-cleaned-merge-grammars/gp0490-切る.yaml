    "etymology": "The verb 「切る(kiru)」 normally means \"to cut.\" However, when attached to the stem of another verb, it takes on a meaning of doing something \"completely\" or \"to the end.\" The nuance often implies that something has been used up or exhausted in the process.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「切る(kiru)」, which normally means \"to cut,\" can be attached to the stem of another verb to indicate that the action is done **completely** or **to the limit**. This often carries a nuance of using up some kind of resource, such as energy or supplies. Therefore, it can be translated as \"to do (A) to the point of being unable to continue,\" or \"to totally and utterly do (A).\" In some cases, it may suggest that (A) is being done with full effort or capacity.",
