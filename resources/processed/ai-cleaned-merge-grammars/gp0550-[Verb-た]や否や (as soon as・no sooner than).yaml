  romaji: ya inaya
formation:
  Verb[た形] + や否や: Indicates that immediately after an action, another action or event occurs.
jlpt: N1
etymology: The expression 「や否や」 (ya inaya) combines 「や」, an ancient interjection or particle indicating
  suddenness or immediate occurrence, with 「否や」, which is derived from 「否」 (ina), meaning 'no' or 'not',
  often used in classical Japanese to signify a negative or a contrary state. In this context, 「否や」 reinforces
  the sense of 'no sooner than' or 'immediately, without delay'. Historically, 「や」 would sometimes function
  as a conjunctive particle indicating immediate succession, and 「否や」 emphasizes the lack of any interval.
  Thus, it literally conveys 'this happens, and immediately, without that not happening, this other thing
  happens'.
writeup: 「〜や否や」 is a formal and literary expression used to describe an immediate succession of two events.
  It means 'as soon as' or 'the moment that' one action or event (A) happens, another action or event
  (B) immediately follows. There is virtually no time gap between A and B. It often implies a sense of
  surprise or an automatic, almost involuntary, reaction to the preceding event. The second event (B)
  is usually something unexpected or noteworthy. This grammatical pattern is more commonly found in written
  Japanese, formal speeches, or narratives, rather than casual conversation. It is typically used with
  verbs that describe a momentary or instantaneous action, rather than a continuous state.

  - term: '[Verb-た] とたん(に)'
    meaning: as soon as; the moment
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜や否や」 emphasizes the immediate succession and often implies a slightly more formal or literary
      tone, with the second event being a swift, sometimes surprising, consequence. 「〜とたん(に)」 is also
      about immediate succession but often describes a sudden, unexpected change or a natural reaction,
      and it can be used more broadly in both formal and informal contexts. While both express immediacy,
      「や否や」 often highlights the lack of an interval, whereas 「とたん」 emphasizes the suddenness of the second
      event.

  - term: '[Verb-た]が早いか'
    meaning: as soon as; no sooner than
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜や否や」 and 「〜が早いか」 are very similar in meaning and usage, both conveying immediate succession.
      However, 「〜や否や」 tends to be more literary and formal, often used for descriptions where the speaker
      is somewhat detached. 「〜が早いか」 often implies a quick, sometimes impulsive, action or reaction. It
      often emphasizes the speed and 'predictable' nature of the follow-up action, while 「や否や」 can carry
      a stronger sense of an unexpected or unavoidable consequence.

  - term: 次第
    meaning: as soon as (after a decision or completion)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「次第」 indicates that an action will happen immediately upon the completion of another, often
      in the context of plans, decisions, or formal announcements. It implies a sense of readiness and
      a planned sequence. In contrast, 「〜や否や」 describes an immediate, often unforeseen or spontaneous,
      consequence of an action that has already occurred.
    grammar_point: 次第 (as soon as)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「〜や否や」, 「〜とたん(に)」, and 「〜が早いか」 all convey the meaning of 'as soon as',
  pay attention to their nuances in formality, spontaneity, and the nature of the following event. 「次第」
  is distinctly different as it relates to scheduled or determined actions rather than an immediate, observed
  reaction.
