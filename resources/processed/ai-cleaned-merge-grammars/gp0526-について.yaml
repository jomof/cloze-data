Literally, it means 'having taken a position regarding' something, which evolved to mean 'about' or 'concerning'. Although the kanji 「就」 exists, については almost always written in hiragana.",
    "writeup": "「について」 is a versatile grammar point used to indicate the topic of a conversation, discussion, or written work. It's similar to saying \"about,\" \"concerning,\" or \"regarding\" in English. It is formed by adding 「について」 directly after a noun. For example, you can say 「日本**について**」 (about Japan) or 「環境問題**について**」 (concerning environmental issues). This grammar point can also be used to modify another noun with 「についての」, as in 「環境問題**についての**本」 (a book about environmental issues). It's useful in both formal and informal settings.",
