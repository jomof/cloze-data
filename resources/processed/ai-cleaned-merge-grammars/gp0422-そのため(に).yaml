    "etymology": "The term そのため(に) is composed of three elements: その (sono), meaning 'that', ため (tame), meaning 'reason' or 'purpose', and the particle に (ni), which indicates direction or purpose. The combination literally translates to 'for that reason' or 'for that purpose'. The kanji 為 (tame) is exceptionally versatile, occasionally used for verbs like する ('to do'), なる ('to become'), なす ('to bring about'), and つくる ('to make'). The kanji itself denotes 'to put (something) to use' with a strong emphasis on the resulting state or outcome, a meaning reflected in all its readings and its use in そのため(に).",
    "writeup": "**そのために** is a conjunction used to connect two sentences, indicating that the second sentence is a result, consequence, or action taken to achieve the goal stated in the first sentence. It commonly translates to \"for that reason,\" \"because of that,\" or \"to that end.\" The particle に is frequently omitted, making **そのため** a very common form in both spoken and written Japanese. It serves as a slightly more formal alternative to expressions like 「なので」 or 「だから」, conveying a logical progression or a deliberate intention. While versatile, **そのため(に)** is more frequently associated with positive outcomes or goals. However, it can still be used in contexts describing unfortunate results, maintaining a neutral stance compared to expressions that assign blame.",
