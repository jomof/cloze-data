    "writeup": "**そのために** is a conjunction used to indicate a cause-and-effect relationship or a purpose. It connects two sentences, where the second sentence is a result or action taken because of the first sentence. The に is often omitted, making **そのため** the more common form. Think of it as a slightly more formal way of saying \"therefore\" or \"to that end.\" It's versatile and widely used in both spoken and written Japanese.",
