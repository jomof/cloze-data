    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てあげる」 combines the 「て」 form of a verb with the verb 「あげる」 (ageru), which means \"to give.\" In this context, 「あげる」 implies giving or bestowing the action of the verb upon someone else.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てあげる」 (te ageru) is used to express doing something for someone's benefit. It combines the 「て」 form of a verb with the verb 「あげる」 (to give). This indicates that the speaker is performing an action as a favor or service for someone else.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Patronizing Tone:** Be cautious when using 「てあげる」 as it can sometimes sound patronizing, especially when used with people of higher status or elderly individuals. The nuance suggests that the speaker is doing something out of their own volition and potentially implying the receiver is unable to do it themselves.\n*   **Alternatives:** In situations where 「てあげる」 might be inappropriate, consider using more neutral or humble expressions like 「てさしあげる」 (te sashiageru) or simply asking if assistance is needed.\n*   **Relationship:** 「てあげる」 is generally appropriate for interactions with family members, close friends, or people of lower status. When in doubt, err on the side of politeness.\n\nIt's crucial to consider the relationship dynamics and social context to avoid unintentionally causing offense.",
