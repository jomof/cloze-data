    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てあげる」 is formed by combining the te-form of a verb with the verb 「あげる」 (ageru), which means 'to give'. In this context, 「あげる」 takes on the nuance of 'bestowing' an action upon someone. This is why it carries the sense of doing something for someone as a favor.",
    "writeup": "When joining the conjunction particle 「て」, with the verb 「あげる」 (to give), it implies that someone is doing something for the benefit of someone else. Literally, this expression means \"to give/bestow the action of (A) upon (B),\" but translates more naturally as \"to do (A) for (B)\", or \"to do (A) as a favor for (B)\". The receiver of the 「てあげる」 action will be marked with 「に」, while the doer will be marked with 「が」 (if mentioned).\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nUnfortunately, 「てあげる」 can sound quite patronizing in modern Japanese, and should be avoided in situations where someone may take offense to having something done for them (for example, doing something for someone of higher status). This is primarily due to 「やる」 (a casual variation of 'to give') being phased out.\n\n**Fun Fact**\n\nOriginally, 「やる」 was used when referring to giving water to plants, or feeding animals. However, some people started using 「あげる」 for these purposes as well, believing that it sounded 'nicer'. Historically, this actually achieved the opposite result, and some people began to think that 「あげる」 was insulting, as it was being used for plants/animals.\n\nThese days, 「てやる」 is almost never used, unless you have a very close relationship with someone and are using it jokingly.",
