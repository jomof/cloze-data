    "etymology": "「は」 is the topic particle. 「もちろん」 means \"of course\" or \"naturally\". Thus, the phrase highlights that something is naturally the case, while also implying there is something else to consider.",
    "writeup": "「はもちろん」, or occasionally 「は勿論」, is a phrase in Japanese that presents an item or concept (A) as being obvious or a given, while also highlighting another item or concept (B) that shares a similar quality or is worth mentioning. The particle 「は」 functions as a topic marker, setting (A) as the primary focus, before the adverb 「もちろん」 reinforces its natural or expected status. Following this, the sentence introduces (B), often with the particle 「も」, indicating that (B) possesses a similar attribute or is equally relevant. This construction is typically used directly after noun (A), before the sentence continues to discuss noun (B). It can be translated into English using phrases such as \"not only (A), but also (B)\", \"let alone (A), (B)\", or \"not to mention (A), (B)\". While sharing a similar meaning with 「だけでなく」, 「はもちろん」 carries a more formal tone. Due to this increased formality, it may sound somewhat stiff in casual conversations unless the speaker intends to emphasize a point significantly.",
