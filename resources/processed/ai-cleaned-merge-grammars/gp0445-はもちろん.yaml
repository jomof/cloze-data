    "etymology": "「は」 is the topic particle. 「もちろん」 means \"of course\" or \"naturally\". Thus, the phrase highlights that something is naturally the case, while also implying there is something else to consider.",
    "writeup": "「はもちろん」, or occasionally 「は勿論」, is a phrase in Japanese that presents 'A' as something obvious, while 'B' should still be considered. 「は」 presents 'A' as a stand-alone topic, before 「もちろん」 emphasizes that 'A' is what it is. After this, the 'B' part of the sentence will describe another factor worth mentioning.\n\n「はもちろん」 is used directly after noun 'A', before the sentence goes on to discuss noun 'B'. This construction can be translated as \"not only A, but B\", \"not to mention A, B\", and other similar English expressions.\n\nIn many cases, despite 'A' being the obvious factor, 'B' is being highlighted as sharing similar qualities to 'A'. This means that in 「はもちろん」 sentences, 「も」 will almost always be seen after 'B'.\n\nWhile similar in meaning to 「だけでなく」, 「はもちろん」 is more formal. It may sound stiff in friendly conversation, unless particularly emphasizing something.",
