jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: teineigo (polite)
  particle-syntactic-function: conjunctive
  particle-pragmatic-function: interrogative
  usage-context: General usage.
  function: To embed a question or an uncertain element within a larger sentence, making the embedded
    clause function like a noun.
  nuance: This usage of 「か」 highlights that the preceding phrase is an unknown or uncertain piece of information
    that is being inquired about or considered within the context of the main sentence. It's distinct
    from 「か」 used as a sentence-ending particle for direct questions.
  counterpoint: Direct questions using 「か」 as a sentence-final particle versus this embedded usage. It
    is also distinct from 「かどうか」 which is specific to binary (yes/no) uncertainties.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a nominalizer for the preceding clause, allowing it to act as the object
    or subject of the main verb in the sentence.
  logical-flow: Introduces an element of inquiry or uncertainty, which is then processed or commented
    on by the main verb or clause. The logical flow moves from the unknown (embedded question) to a statement
    about that unknown.
  temporal-flow: Can refer to past, present, or future events within the embedded question, with the main
    verb indicating the temporal relationship to the act of knowing, deciding, etc.
  spatial-flow: Not directly related to physical space, but can embed questions about location (e.g.,
    「どこか」) where the spatial uncertainty is contained within the embedded clause.
etymology: 'The particle 「か」 has two primary functions: as a sentence-ending particle indicating a question
  and as an adverbial particle highlighting uncertainty. In this grammar point, 「か」 functions as an adverbial
  particle, similar to its use in words like 「どこか」 (somewhere) or 「誰か」 (someone). It marks the preceding
  question phrase as an uncertain element being inquired about within the main sentence.'
writeup: |-
  The particle 「か」 serves to embed a question within a larger statement. It transforms a direct question into a clause that functions as a noun within the sentence. This is different from using 「か」 as a sentence-ending particle, which forms a direct question.

  When using 「か」 in this way, **avoid** placing 「だ」 or 「です」 immediately before it when following nouns or na-adjectives. For example, instead of 「どこだか」, use 「どこか」.

  The embedded question is often followed by verbs like 「知っている」 (to know), 「分かる」 (to understand), or 「決める」 (to decide), which indicate an action or state related to the uncertain information. While the embedded question implies uncertainty, a direct question marker at the end of the main sentence is not strictly required but can be added for emphasis or clarity, especially in spoken language.
false_friends:
  - term: かどうか
    meaning: Whether or not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「かどうか」 is specifically used when there are only two possibilities (e.g., 'yes' or 'no', 'true'
      or 'false'). 「か」 with a question phrase can cover a wider range of open-ended inquiries within a
      sentence.
    grammar_point: かどうか (whether or not)
  - term: か (or)
    meaning: Or
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This 「か」 connects two alternatives in a list (e.g., りんごかみかん 'apple or orange'), and does not
      embed a question or denote uncertainty within a larger sentence.
    grammar_point: か (or)
  - term: か〜ないかのうちに
    meaning: Right after, As soon as, Just when, Barely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a set phrase used to describe the immediacy of one action following another. Despite
      containing 「か」, its meaning and grammatical function are completely unrelated to embedding questions.
    grammar_point: か〜ないかのうちに (immediately after)
  - term: ことか
    meaning: How surprising or emotional
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both use 「か」, 「ことか」 is an exclamatory expression used to convey strong emotion or surprise,
      not to embed a factual question within another sentence.
    grammar_point: ことか (how surprising or emotional)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that the primary function of 「Question-phrase
  + か」 is to embed a question or an unknown within a larger sentence. In contrast, 「かどうか」 is used for
  binary choices, 「か」 (as a false friend) connects alternatives, 「か〜ないかのうちに」 expresses a temporal relationship,
  and 「ことか」 is for strong emotional emphasis. Each serves a distinct purpose in Japanese grammar.
examples:
  - english: Do you know when he will come?
    japanese:
      - 彼 が いつ 来る {か} 知っ てる？
      - 彼 が いつ いらっしゃる {か}、ご 存知 です か？
      - 彼 は いつ 来る {か}、教え て いただけ ます か？
      - 彼 が いつ 来る {か}、まだ 分かり ませ ん。
    english_literally: When he comes, do you know?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は いつ 来 ます か。
        english: When will he come?
        hint: This is a direct question asking for information. We are looking for an embedded question
          within a larger sentence.
    scene: You're asking a colleague about a new team member's start date.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: This sentence structure embeds the question 「いつ 来る」 (when he will come) within the larger
      question 「知っていますか」 (Do you know?). This is different from a direct question about his arrival. The
      polite form 「知っていますか」 is suitable for a professional setting.
    etymology: The usage of 「か」 here originates from its function as a marker of uncertainty, which is
      then 'known' or 'unknown' by the main verb.
  - english: We don't know yet if this plan will succeed.
    japanese:
      - この 計画 が 成功 する {か} は、まだ 分かり ませ ん。
      - この 計画 が うまく いく {か}、まだ 分かり ませ ん ね。
      - この 計画 が 成功 する {か}、誰 も 断言 でき ませ ん。
    english_literally: This plan succeeding or not, we don't know yet.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 計画 が 成功 する か どう か まだ 分かり ませ ん。
        english: We don't know yet whether or not this plan will succeed.
        hint: 「かどうか」 specifically refers to a binary 'yes/no' type of uncertainty. While similar, the
          simple 「か」 can be used more broadly for general unknowns, not just two options.
    scene: A project manager is giving an update on a new, risky venture.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The phrase 「成功する か」 (whether it will succeed) is an embedded clause that functions as the
      object of 「分かりません」 (don't know). This expresses uncertainty about the plan's outcome, fitting a
      professional update where outcomes are not yet guaranteed.
    etymology: The use of 「か」 in embedded clauses like this traces back to its role in indicating a choice
      or alternative, here between 'succeed' and 'not succeed', which then becomes the subject of uncertainty.
  - english: No one knows where he went.
    japanese:
      - 彼 が どこ へ 行っ た {か}、誰 も 知ら ない よ。
      - 彼 が どこ へ 行っ た {か}、誰 も 知ら ない。
      - 彼 が どこ に 行っ た の {か}、誰 も 知り ませ ん。
      - 彼 が どちら へ 行か れ た の {か}、存じ上げ ませ ん。
      - 奴 が どこ へ 行き や がっ た {か}、誰 も 知ら ねえ よ。
    english_literally: Where he went, no one knows, you know.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は どこ へ 行っ た。
        english: He went somewhere.
        hint: This sentence makes a statement without expressing uncertainty about a location. We are
          looking for an embedded question about 'where' someone went.
    scene: Friends are talking casually about a mutual friend who disappeared abruptly.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「よ」 at the end adds a sense of assertion or emphasis, common in casual speech among
      friends. While sometimes associated with male speech, it is also used by female speakers in a friendly,
      conversational context. The phrase 「誰 も 知らない よ」 (no one knows, you know) embeds the question of
      his whereabouts as the unknown information.
    etymology: 「よ」 as a sentence-final particle has evolved to convey various pragmatic meanings, from
      informing to asserting, often reflecting the speaker's emotional stance or desire for shared understanding.
  - english: I'm looking forward to when Mom will bake the cake.
    japanese:
      - お 母 さん が いつ ケーキ を 焼い て くれる {か}、楽しみ だ なあ。
      - お 母 さん が いつ ケーキ を 焼い て くれる {か}、楽しみ だ よ ね。
      - お 母 さん が いつ ケーキ を 焼い て くれる {か}、今 から 待ち遠しい な。
      - お 母 さん が いつ ケーキ を 焼く {か}、すごく 楽しみ！
      - ママ が いつ ケーキ を 焼い て くれる {か}、ワクワク する ね！
    english_literally: When Mom bakes the cake for me, it's fun, you know.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 母 さん が ケーキ を 焼い て くれる の が 楽しみ だ な。
        english: I'm looking forward to Mom baking the cake.
        hint: This sentence expresses general anticipation for an event, not specifically for the unknown
          'when' of the event. We are looking for an embedded question about the timing.
    scene: A young child excitedly talking about their mom's baking.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The particle 「な」 at the end conveys a sense of personal feeling or light exclamation, common
      in casual speech, especially among younger speakers like a child. The embedded question 「いつ 焼いて
      くれる か」 (when she will bake) acts as the object of anticipation for 「楽しみだ」 (I'm looking forward to
      it).
    etymology: The particle 「な」 has roots in older forms of Japanese, often used to express strong emotion
      or emphasis, and it continues to be prevalent in casual, expressive speech, particularly among children
      and women.
  - english: Please think carefully about whether this is really necessary.
    japanese:
      - これ が 本当 に 必要 {か}、よく 考え て ください。
      - これ が 本当 に 必要 {か}、今 一 度 よく 検討 し て ください。
      - これ が 本当 に 必要 な の {か}、よく 考え て み て ください。
      - これ が 本当 に 必要 {か}、君 自身 で 判断 し なさい。
    english_literally: This truly necessary, please think carefully.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ が 本当 に 必要 か どう か よく 考え て ください。
        english: Please think carefully whether or not this is really necessary.
        hint: While 「かどうか」 is common for 'whether or not' questions, the simpler 「か」 is also grammatically
          correct and often used when the alternatives are implied. We are looking for the direct use
          of 「か」 with a question phrase.
    scene: A manager instructing their team to review a requirement before proceeding.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The phrase 「これ が 本当 に 必要 か」 (whether this is really necessary) is an embedded question that
      serves as the object of the command 「よく 考えて ください」 (please think carefully). This semi-formal tone
      is appropriate for a manager addressing a team, implying a directive to evaluate the necessity.
    etymology: The imperative form 「〜て ください」 is a polite request, stemming from the verb 「くださる」 (to give),
      which implies the action is being 'given' to the listener as a favor or instruction.
  - english: Let's decide where to eat dinner.
    japanese:
      - 晩ごはん、どこ に する {か} 決めよう。
      - 夕食 を どこ で 食べる {か} 決め ましょう。
      - 食事 を どこ で とる {か}、決定 し ましょう。
    english_literally: Dinner, where to make it, let's decide.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 晩ごはん は 何 を 食べる？
        english: What are we eating for dinner?
        hint: This is a direct question about *what* to eat, not an embedded question about *where* to
          eat. We are looking to embed the location question.
    scene: Two friends are brainstorming dinner plans for the evening.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
  - english: I wonder what he's thinking.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 何 を 考え て いる {か} なあ。
      - 彼 が 何 を お 考え な の {か}、気 に なり ます ね。
      - 彼 は 何 を 考え て いる の だ {か}、不明 です。
    english_literally: What he is thinking, I wonder.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 何 を 考え て いる の？
        english: What is he thinking?
        hint: This is a direct question asking someone else what he's thinking. We are looking for an
          internal wondering or speculation about what he's thinking.
    scene: You see a colleague sitting quietly at their desk, looking deep in thought.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
  - english: Could you tell me how I should fill out this form?

      - この 用紙、どう 書け ば いい {か}、教え て くれる？
      - この 書類 を いかに 記載 すれ ば よろしい {か}、ご 教示 願え ます か？
    english_literally: This form, how should I fill it out, please tell me.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 書類 の 記入 方法 を 教え て いただけ ます か？
        english: Could you tell me the method for filling out this document?
        hint: This asks for the 'method' directly. We are looking to embed the 'how' as a question within
          the request.
    scene: You are at a municipal office trying to fill out an unfamiliar document.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
  - english: It's uncertain whether she will truly agree.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 が 本当 に 同意 する {か} は 分から ない。
      - 彼女 が 心底 承諾 する {か} は 不明 だ。
      - 彼女 は 本当 に 首 を 縦 に 振る {か}、怪しい もの だ。
    english_literally: Whether she will truly agree, it is unknown.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 が 同意 する か どう か、まだ 不明 です。
        english: It's still uncertain whether or not she will agree.
        hint: This emphasizes a binary 'yes' or 'no' outcome. We are looking for a more general expression
          of uncertainty about her agreement, not necessarily a two-option choice.
    scene: Two business partners are discussing a difficult client's potential decision on a new proposal.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
  - english: I can't recall what time the meeting starts.

      - 打ち合わせ の 開始 時刻 が 何 時 {か}、記憶 が 定か で は ない。
    english_literally: What time the meeting starts, I can't recall.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 は 何 時 に 始まり ます か？
        english: What time does the meeting start?
        hint: This is a direct question asking for the meeting time. We are looking to express an inability
          to recall the time, embedding the 'what time' as the object of 'recall'.
    scene: A busy professional quickly checks their calendar, realizing they can't remember the exact
      start time for an upcoming meeting.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
post_example_writeup: The usage of 「Question-phrase + か」 allows for flexible and nuanced communication,
  integrating uncertain or unknown information smoothly into broader statements or requests. This construction
  is highly common in everyday Japanese for expressing thoughts about information, rather than directly
  asking for it.
