details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: To explain, request explanation, or add emphasis/conviction to a statement, implying a reason
    or context.
  nuance: Adds a sense of shared understanding or context, implying that the statement is a reason or
    explanation for something implied or observed. It frames the statement as background information or
    a justification, creating a more intimate or explanatory tone than a simple declarative sentence.
    It can also imply emotional involvement from the speaker.
  grammatical-role: Sentence-final auxiliary
etymology: The origin of this construction can be traced back to the nominalizing particle 'の' (no), which
  functions similarly to 'こと' or 'もの' in turning a clause into a noun phrase. When combined with the copula
  'です' (desu), 'の です' literally meant 'it is (the matter/fact) of...'. Over time, this evolved to convey
  an explanatory or emphatic nuance. The 'ん' form, 'んです', is a phonetic contraction of 'のです' that arose
  from natural speech patterns, making it easier and quicker to pronounce, especially in everyday conversation.
  This shortening reflects a common linguistic phenomenon where sounds are assimilated or dropped for
  efficiency, Solidifying its place as the more common and casual variant in spoken Japanese.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point **Noun+な・Verb[dictionary]・Adjective+んです・のです** serves multiple crucial functions in Japanese, primarily for providing explanations, seeking clarification, or adding emphasis to a statement. It goes beyond merely stating a fact, implying that the speaker is offering a reason, cause, or background information for something.

  While **んです** and **なのです** are both polite forms, **んです** is much more common in everyday spoken Japanese, giving it a somewhat more conversational and less formal feel than the slightly stiffer **なのです**. In truly informal speech, their plain forms are **んだ** and **のだ** respectively. Particularly among younger speakers, male speakers often use **んだ**, while female speakers frequently use **の** (the plain form of **のだ**), especially to express emotion or seek confirmation.

  This construction attaches to the plain form of verbs and い-adjectives. For nouns and な-adjectives, a **な** is required before **んです/なのです** (e.g., 学生**なんです**, 静か**なんです**). This 'な' acts as a connecting particle, similar to how it connects な-adjectives to nouns.

  When used in a question form (e.g., **〜んですか**), it indicates that the speaker is seeking an explanation or the reason behind something observed or known. It adds a nuanced layer of inquiry, suggesting that the speaker is not just asking for a simple fact but for context, justification, or a deeper understanding. This makes conversations more engaging and allows for more natural probing into underlying reasons.

  Understanding the subtle implication of providing a reason or context is key. If a simple statement of fact suffices, **です** or **だ** is used. However, when you want to frame your statement as an explanation, or when you are responding to an implied question about *why* something is the way it is, **んです/なのです** becomes essential. It creates a sense of shared understanding, implying that the statement is relevant to a current situation or observation.
false_friends:
  - term: です
    meaning: to be, is
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike '〜んです/のです', 'です' is a simple copula used to state a fact without implying a reason
      or explanation. 'です' is less explanatory and does not inherently convey the speaker's emotional
      involvement or shared context that '〜んです/のです' does.
    grammar_point: です (polite copula)
  - term: 〜から
    meaning: because, since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While `〜から` explicitly states a cause or reason, `〜んです/のです` implies a reason or explanation
      that the speaker assumes the listener needs or is seeking. `〜から` is a direct causal connector, whereas
      `〜んです/のです` frames the preceding statement as an explanation in response to an implied context or
      question.
    grammar_point: から・ので (reason・cause)
  - term: 〜らしい
    meaning: appears to be
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While `〜らしい` indicates that something seems true based on information or common understanding
      (often hearsay), `〜んです/のです` is used when the speaker is stating something as a fact, or as *their
      own* explanation or emphasis. `〜らしい` conveys inference, `〜んです/のです` conveys conviction or context.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
  - term: はずだ (expected to be)
    meaning: expected to be
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both '〜んです/なのです' and 'はずだ' can explain why something is the case, 'はずだ' implies a logical
      expectation or certainty based on known facts or common sense. '〜んです/のです' focuses on providing an
      explanation or background for a current situation or observation, often in response to an implied
      question, and can carry more emotional nuance or a personal conviction.
    grammar_point: はずだ (expected to be)
  - term: '[Adj-stem]・[V-stem]そうだ (looks・seems like)'
    meaning: looks or seems like
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Similar to 'らしい', 'そう' indicates an appearance or inference based on observation. '〜んです/のです',
      however, is used for stating a direct explanation or reason, often for a situation already understood
      or experienced by the speaker. 'そう' describes how something *appears*, while '〜んです/のです' explains
      *what* it is or *why* it is.
    grammar_point: '[Adj・V-stem]そうだ (it looks・seems like)'
  - term: こと (nominalizer)
    meaning: abstract thing, making a verb a noun
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Both 'の' (as in 'のです') and 'こと' can nominalize clauses. However, 'の' in 'のです' specifically
      introduces an explanation, reason, or emphasis, often tying the statement to an underlying context.
      'こと' more generally turns a verb or adjective phrase into a conceptual noun, without the inherent
      explanatory or emphatic nuance of 'のです'.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]こと (the act of・the fact that)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While 'です' merely states a fact and '〜から' directly expresses cause, '〜んです/のです'
  subtly implies a reason or explanation, or adds emphasis, often in response to an implied question or
  to establish a shared context. Unlike inferences like 'らしい' or 'そう', '〜んです/なのです' conveys the speaker's
  direct conviction or explanation. Similarly, while 'はずだ' denotes a logical expectation, '〜んです/なのです'
  serves to frame a statement as an explanation for a current situation, often with a personal touch.
  Understand that 'の' in 'のです' functions as a nominalizer, much like 'こと', but specifically carries this
  explanatory or emphatic function, making it more than just a factual statement.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 語 が もっと 上手 に なり たい {です}！
        english: I want to become better at Japanese!
        hint: This expresses a desire. We are looking for a statement that adds strong emphasis and personal
          conviction to that desire.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 語 が もっと 上手 に なり たい {から}！
        english: Because I really want to become better at Japanese!
        hint: This explicitly states 'because' and usually requires a consequence. We are looking for
          an explanatory tone without explicitly stating 'because'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 語 が もっと 上手 に なり たい {らしい}！
        english: It seems I really want to become better at Japanese!
        hint: This conveys an inference or hearsay about one's own desire, which is unnatural. We are
          looking for the speaker's direct, emphatic statement of their desire.
    scene: A young female student enthusiastically telling her tutor about her study goals, explaining
      her dedication.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: inspirational
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The female speaker's use of 'んです' when expressing a strong desire like「もっと 上手 に なりたい{んです}！」adds
      a sense of personal conviction and explanation, making it clear that this desire is the *reason*
      for her efforts or a central part of her current state. This phrasing is very natural for a younger
      female expressing enthusiasm or a strong personal motivation.

        english: Because I'm tired, I'm going home now.

          - 疲れ た {らしい}。今 から 帰る。
        english: It seems I'm tired. I'm going home now.

          - この 猫、本当 に かわいい {から} ね。

post_example_writeup: As demonstrated, **〜んです/のです** is highly versatile. It can be used to explain personal
  circumstances, provide reasons for actions, or emphasize a statement’s significance. Pay close attention
  to the context and the speaker's intention to fully grasp its nuanced meaning, as it often bridges a
  statement to an implicit question or observation.
