formation:
  Noun + でも + Noun + でも: Indicates that the statement applies regardless of which noun is chosen; can
    imply 'whether...or...', 'either...or...', or 'neither...nor...'
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General
etymology: The particle 「でも」 (demo) originates from 「とて」 (tote), an older particle meaning 'even if' or
  'even though', combined with the auxiliary verb 「ある」 (aru) in its attributive form 「の」 (no) and then
  the particle 「も」 (mo) meaning 'also' or 'too'. Over time, 「とのも」 or 「てのも」 evolved into 「でも」. When used
  singularly, 「でも」 functions as 'even', 'at least', or 'anything/anyone (at all)'. Its repetition, 「でも〜でも」,
  specifically emphasizes an inclusive or indifferent choice between two or more options. It asserts that
  the outcome or statement remains true regardless of which specified option is chosen, highlighting the
  universal applicability or lack of preference.
writeup: The grammar point 「Noun+でも〜でも」 is used to express that a statement holds true regardless of which
  of the specified nouns is chosen. It effectively presents two or more options and states that the main
  clause applies universally to them. This pattern can be translated as "whether...or..." or "neither...nor...",
  depending on whether the accompanying statement is affirmative or negative. The core nuance of 「でも」
  in this context is 'even if' or 'no matter', suggesting that the choice between the presented options
  does not affect the outcome or truth of the statement. This construction is useful when you want to
  convey flexibility, indifference, or a comprehensive scope regarding the options. It implies that any
  of the listed items would lead to the same conclusion or is equally acceptable.
false_friends:
  - term: かどうか
    meaning: Whether or not, If...or not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「Noun+でも〜でも」, which presents two or more concrete options and implies indifference,
      「かどうか」 presents a binary choice between a statement and its negation, typically asking for confirmation
      or expressing uncertainty.
    grammar_point: かどうか (whether or not)
  - term: にしても〜にしても
    meaning: Regardless of whether
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「にしても〜にしても」 often implies a stronger sense of concession than 「Noun+でも〜でも」, suggesting that
      the outcome remains the same even under different, potentially adverse, circumstances. It can also
      imply a slight critical or dismissive nuance depending on context.
    grammar_point: にしても〜にしても (regardless of whether a or b)
  - term: 〜ても〜ても
    meaning: Even if X, even if Y (repeated effort or state)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜ても〜ても」 directly connects two conditional clauses (e.g., 'even if it rains, even if
      it snows'), 「Noun+でも〜でも」 connects two nouns, implying the statement holds true for either, often
      with a nuance of 'regardless of' or 'any kind of' in a less conditional sense.
    grammar_point: 〜ても〜ても (repeated effort or state)
  - term: にしろ〜にしろ
    meaning: Whether… or
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Similar to 「にしても〜にしても」, 「にしろ〜にしろ」 also implies a stronger emphasis on the alternatives and
      their potential outcomes, often used in more formal or assertive contexts. It can also carry a nuance
      of determination or finality.
    grammar_point: にしろ〜にしろ (whether... or...)
  - term: か〜か
    meaning: Whether A or B; A or B (questioning/listing options)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「か〜か」 merely lists options or asks for a choice between two alternatives, 「Noun+でも〜でも」
      implies that the main clause's statement holds true regardless of which option is chosen, indicating
      a sense of inclusivity or indifference towards the listed items. It conveys 'either/any of these
      is fine'.
    grammar_point: か〜か (whether... or)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share the sense of presenting alternatives, 「Noun+でも〜でも」
  is unique in its simple enumeration of possibilities and its implications of “regardless of which”.
  It often conveys a sense of flexibility or openness to either choice, rather than a concession. To avoid
  mixing them up, consider if you simply want to list options in a flexible way where any choice yields
  the same result (use 「〜でも〜でも」), or if you're trying to express something more nuanced like a concession
  or a definitive binary choice.
examples:
  - english: Whether it's coffee or tea, I want something warm to drink.
    japanese:
      - コーヒー {で も} お 茶 {で も}、何 か 温かい 飲み物 が 欲しい な。
      - コーヒー {で も} お 茶 {で も}、温かい 飲み物 が 欲しい です。
      - コーヒー {で も} お 茶 {で も}、温かい 飲み物 が 欲しい ん です。
    english_literally: Coffee even tea even, something warm drinkable desired huh.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - コーヒー {か} お 茶 {か}、何 か 温かい 飲み物 が 欲しい な。
        english: Is it coffee or tea? I want something warm to drink.
        hint: The particle 「か」 simply presents options without the nuance of indifference or 'either/any'
          which is conveyed by 「でも」. We're looking for an expression that suggests any of the options
          are fine.
    scene: A man sitting down in a cafe, feeling a bit chilled, and considering his options for a hot
      beverage.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The 「〜な」 at the end is a common masculine casual expression for expressing a wish or mild
      uncertainty. When a man uses 「な」, it can soften the statement and express a mild desire. The repetition
      of 「でも」 emphasizes the speaker's indifference to the specific choice, conveying that either coffee
      or tea would be equally satisfying.
    etymology: The suffix 「な」 comes from the classical Japanese interrogative particle 「なむ」, which evolved
      to express mild assertion or a soft imperative, and in modern speech often conveys personal feeling
      or seeking agreement.
  - english: I can speak either Japanese or English.
    japanese:
      - 日本 語 {で も} 英語 {で も}、どちら {で も} 話せ ます。
      - 日本 語 {で も} 英語 {で も}、どちら も 話せ ます。
      - 日本 語 {で も} 英語 {で も}、問題 なく 話せ ます。
    english_literally: Japanese even English even, either can speak.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 語 {か} 英語 {か}、どちら {か} 話せ ます。
        english: I can speak either Japanese or English (implying a choice is needed).
        hint: The construction 「A か B か」 simply lists options. 「でも〜でも」 goes beyond just listing to imply
          that *any* of the listed options is acceptable or true for the statement. We're looking for
          a way to express proficiency in both languages without preference.
    scene: A person being interviewed for a job that requires multilingual skills.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    etymology: The term 「どちら」 (dochira) literally means 'which of two' and derives from 「どっち」 (docchi),
      which is a more informal version. The construction here emphasizes proficiency in both, making either
      equally available options for communication.
  - english: Whether it rains or snows, I have to go to school every day.
    japanese:
      - 雨 {で も} 雪 {で も}、毎日 学校 に 行か なけれ ば なり ませ ん。
      - 雨 {で も} 雪 {で も}、毎日 学校 へ 行か なく ちゃ なり ませ ん。
      - 雨 {で も} 雪 {で も}、毎日 学校 に 行く しか あり ませ ん。
    english_literally: Rain even snow even, every day school to must go.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 が 降っ {て も} 雪 が 降っ {て も}、毎日 学校 に 行か なけれ ば なり ませ ん。
        english: Even if it rains, even if it snows, I have to go to school every day.
        hint: While 「〜ても〜ても」 also expresses concession, it is applied to verbs/actions and sounds more
          like a conditional 'even if'. 「Noun+でも〜でも」 applies to nouns and implies that the state (rain,
          snow) itself is irrelevant to the outcome. We want to show that the type of weather doesn't
          matter.
    scene: A student feeling resigned about their daily commute during a bad weather season.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    etymology: The expression 「〜なければなりません」 is a polite form of obligation. 「ねば」 is a classical negative
      conditional form, and 「ならない」 means 'it doesn't become/happen', combining to mean 'if it doesn't
      happen, it won't become', hence 'must'.
  - english: Whether it's him or her, I'll forgive them if they tell me the truth.
    japanese:
      - 彼 {で も} 彼女 {で も}、正直 に 話し て くれれ ば 許し ます。
      - 彼 {で も} 彼女 {で も}、正直 に 話し て くれれ ば 許し て あげ ます。
      - 彼 {で も} 彼女 {で も}、真実 を 話し て くれれ ば 許し ます。
    english_literally: Him even her even, honestly if they speak-give, will forgive.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 {か} 彼女 {か} どちら {か} が、正直 に 話し て くれれ ば 許し ます。
        english: If either him or her tells the truth, I will forgive them.
        hint: The expression 「どちらか」 explicitly points to 'one or the other'. 「でも〜でも」 implies that the
          condition for forgiveness holds true for *either* person, without having to choose one. We're
          looking for an expression that suggests indifference to the specific person.
    scene: A parent speaking to another family member about their children, emphasizing that an honest
      confession from either child will lead to forgiveness.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    etymology: 「正直」 (shōjiki) combines 「正」 (shō, correct/just) and 「直」 (jiki, direct/straight), literally
      meaning 'correctly direct', referring to honesty and straightforwardness.
  - english: Whether by phone or email, please contact me.
    japanese:
      - 電話 {で も} メール {で も}、連絡 を ください。
      - 電話 {で も} メール {で も}、ご 連絡 いただけ ます か？
      - 電話 {で も} メール {で も}、ご 都合 の よい 方法 で ご 連絡 ください。
    english_literally: Phone even email even, contact please give.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 電話 {か} メール で 連絡 を ください。
        english: Please contact me by phone or email (listing options).
        hint: Using 「か」 simply lists the communication methods. 「でも〜でも」 emphasizes that *either* method
          is equally acceptable or convenient, implying flexibility. We want to convey that there is no
          preference for the contact method.
    scene: A colleague explaining to a new team member how to reach them.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    etymology: 「連絡」 (renraku) is a compound kanji word, with 「連」 (ren) meaning 'to link/connect' and 「絡」
      (raku) meaning 'to entwine/coil', together forming the meaning of 'to connect' or 'to contact'.
  - english: Whether you like it or dislike it, say it clearly.
    japanese:
      - 好き {で も} 嫌い {で も}、はっきり 言っ て。
      - 好き {で も} 嫌い {で も}、はっきり 言っ て ください。
      - 好き {で も} 嫌い {で も}、遠慮 なく 言っ て ごらん。
    english_literally: Like even dislike even, clearly say.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 好き で {あろう と} 嫌い で {あろう と}、はっきり 言っ て。
        english: Whether it be liking it or disliking it, say it clearly.
        hint: The expression 「〜であろうと〜であろうと」 is more formal and literary. 「でも〜でも」 is a more direct and
          natural way to list two contrasting states and assert that the main statement applies to both,
          emphasizing indifference to the specific feeling. We're looking for a conversational way to
          express that the feeling doesn't matter.
    scene: Someone urging a friend to be direct and honest about their feelings about a proposal.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    etymology: 「はっきり」 (hakkiri) is an adverb often used to describe clarity, distinctness, or decisiveness.
      Its origin is thought to be onomatopoeic, conveying the sharp, clear sound of something becoming
      distinct.
  - english: Whether it's a movie or a meal, I want to go somewhere.
    japanese:
      - 映画 {で も} 食事 {で も}、どこ か 行き たい ね。
      - 映画 {で も} 食事 {で も}、どこ か 行き ませ ん か？
      - 映画 {で も} 食事 {で も}、何 か 楽しい こと しよう よ。
    english_literally: Movie even meal even, somewhere want to go, right?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 映画 {か} 食事 {か} どこ か 行き たい ね。
        english: Movie or meal, I want to go somewhere.
        hint: Using 「か」 simply presents the options as a choice between one or the other. 「でも〜でも」 implies
          that *any* of the listed options would be satisfactory, conveying a flexible and open attitude.
          We want to express that either activity is fine.
    scene: A couple discussing their plans for a date night, open to various activities.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The 「ね」 at the end is commonly used by both genders to seek agreement or confirmation from
      the listener. The speaker's use of 「〜たいね」 expresses a shared desire, and the repetition of 「でも」
      demonstrates openness to either option, contributing to a flexible and inviting atmosphere typical
      of a flirty setting.
    etymology: The word 「映画」 (eiga) meaning 'movie' is a combination of 「映」 (ei, to reflect/project) and
      「画」 (ga, picture/drawing), literally meaning 'projected pictures'.
  - english: For lunch, anything is fine, whether it's ramen or sushi.
    japanese:
      - 昼 ごはん は ラーメン {で も} 寿司 {で も}、何 で も いい です。
      - ランチ は ラーメン {で も} 寿司 {で も}、何 で も いい です よ。
      - 昼食 は ラーメン {で も} 寿司 {で も}、どちら で も 構い ませ ん。
    english_literally: As for lunch, ramen even sushi even, anything is fine.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ラーメン {か} 寿司 {か}、何 で も いい です。
        english: Ramen or sushi, anything is fine.
        hint: The particle 「か」 simply presents options, while 「でも〜でも」 emphasizes an indifference towards
          the specific choice, implying that any of the listed items is equally acceptable. We're looking
          for an expression that shows complete flexibility regarding the food choice.
    scene: Two friends are trying to decide what to eat for lunch, and one expresses complete flexibility.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The phrase 「何 で も いい です」 reinforces the indifference established by 「でも〜でも」, indicating that
      the speaker truly has no preference and is agreeable to any choice presented, be it 「ラーメン」 or 「寿司」。
      The addition of 「よ」 in the second variation makes it slightly more assertive or reassuring, and
      is commonly used by female speakers as well as male speakers.
  - english: Whether it's success or failure, you must learn from the experience.
    japanese:
      - 成功 {で も} 失敗 {で も}、経験 から 学ぶ べき です。
      - 成功 {で も} 失敗 {で も}、経験 から 学び なさい。
      - 成功 {で も} 失敗 {で も}、必ず 経験 から 学ん で ください。
    english_literally: Success even failure even, from experience should learn.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 成功 {か} 失敗 {か} は 関係 なく、経験 から 学ぶ べき です。
        english: Regardless of whether it's success or failure, you should learn from the experience.
        hint: While 「〜か〜か は 関係 なく」 explicitly states 'regardless of', 「でも〜でも」 more concisely conveys that
          all outcomes, whether positive or negative, offer learning opportunities. We're looking for
          a more direct way to express learning from any outcome.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 成功 で {あろう と} 失敗 で {あろう と}、経験 から 学ぶ べき です。
        english: Whether it be success or failure, you should learn from the experience.
        hint: The expression 「〜であろうと〜であろうと」 is more formal and literary. 「でも〜でも」 is a more common and
          natural way to convey that the main statement applies to both contrasting states. We're looking
          for a simpler, yet impactful way to state this universal truth.
    scene: A senior colleague giving advice to a junior team member after a project review.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Using 「〜べき です」 adds a nuance of strong recommendation or obligation, emphasizing the importance
      of learning from all outcomes, whether positive (「成功」) or negative (「失敗」). The repetition of 「でも」
      underscores that *either* result serves as valuable learning, making the advice comprehensive.
    etymology: 「成功」 (seikō) combines 「成」 (sei, to become, achieve) and 「功」 (kō, merit, achievement). 「失敗」
      (shippai) combines 「失」 (shitsu, to lose, miss) and 「敗」 (pai, to be defeated).
  - english: Neither money nor power will bring true happiness.
    japanese:
      - お 金 {で も} 権力 {で も}、本当 の 幸せ は もたらし ませ ん。
      - お 金 {で も} 権力 {で も}、真 の 幸せ に は なり ませ ん。
      - お 金 {で も} 権力 {で も}、本当 の 幸せ と は 言え ませ ん。
    english_literally: Money even power even, true happiness will not bring.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 金 {も} 権力 {も}、本当 の 幸せ は もたらし ませ ん。
        english: Money and power will not bring true happiness.
        hint: While 「〜も〜も」 can also convey 'neither...nor...', 「でも〜でも」 adds a stronger emphasis on the
          inadequacy of *even* these highly valued things. It implies that these options, despite their
          perceived value, are insufficient for true happiness. We want to highlight the surprising insufficiency.
    scene: An experienced individual sharing a life lesson with a younger, ambitious person.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The negation 「もたらし ませ ん」 combined with 「でも〜でも」 creates the nuance of 'neither...nor...', implying
      that true happiness cannot be obtained through either money (「お 金」) or power (「権力」), emphasizing
      their ultimate inadequacy. The repetition highlights the point that *even* these desirable things
      are not enough.
  - english: Whether you're young or old, everyone loves this song.
    japanese:
      - 若者 {で も} 年配 者 {で も}、この 歌 は みんな 大好き です。
      - 若者 {で も} 年配 者 {で も}、この 歌 は 誰 に で も 愛さ れ ます。
      - 若者 {で も} 年配 者 {で も}、この 歌 は いつ まで も 歌わ れ ます。
    english_literally: Young person even old person even, this song everyone loves.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 若者 と 年配 者、{どちら も} この 歌 が 大好き です。
        english: Young people and old people, both love this song.
        hint: The phrasing 「どちら も」 implies that both groups love the song, but 「でも〜でも」 emphasizes that
          *regardless* of age, the love for the song exists, highlighting a more universal appeal. We
          want to express that the song transcends age barriers.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 若者 {も} 年配 者 {も}、この 歌 が 大好き です。
        english: Young people and old people also love this song.
        hint: While 「〜も〜も」 lists both categories, 「でも〜でも」 carries a stronger nuance of 'even if you are
          X, even if you are Y,' suggesting that the song's appeal is so strong it doesn't matter what
          age you are. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes the song's broad, unconditional
          appeal.
    scene: A group of people from various generations are at a karaoke bar, and a classic song comes on,
      leading to a sing-along.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The repeated 「でも」 here emphasizes that the love for the song transcends age groups (「若者」 -
      young people, 「年配者」 - elderly people). It highlights the universal appeal, implying 'regardless
      of whether they are young or old.' The use of 「みんな」 (everyone) further reinforces this inclusivity.
    etymology: 「年配者」 (nenpaisha) combines 「年」 (nen, year) and 「配」 (pai, group/distribution) with 「者」 (sha,
      person), literally meaning someone who has accumulated many years, i.e., an elderly person.
post_example_writeup: The repeated 「でも」 can be used to list seemingly exhaustive options, but implicitly
  acknowledges the existence of more options. It is commonly used when you do not want to list all possible
  options, but want to give the listener a sense of the possibilities. This structure emphasizes that
  the conclusion applies irrespective of which specific option is chosen from a group.
