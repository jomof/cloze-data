    "etymology": "「なさる」is derived from the verb 「為す(なす)」, which means \"to do\" or \"to perform.\" The addition of the honorific suffix 「〜なさ」 elevates the verb to a respectful form. 「為す」itself has classical roots, often appearing in older texts and conveying a sense of formality.",
    "writeup": "「なさる」 is an honorific verb, a type of 「敬語(keigo)」, which expresses respect for the actions of others. Importantly, you should **never** use it to describe your own actions. It is an honorific equivalent of 「する(suru)」, meaning \"to do.\" 「なさる」is a special-class verb, so its conjugations are slightly irregular. In casual form, it conjugates like a regular う-verb. However, in polite form, 「る」 changes to 「い」 instead of 「り」. For example, 「する」 becomes 「なさいます」. While some speakers use constructions like 「なさっていらっしゃる」, this is considered double keigo and technically incorrect. However, 「なさる」 can be used with 「ます」. Some sources suggest that 「お〜になる」 is now preferred over 「なさる」, but you will encounter this in daily life.",
