    "etymology": "なさる is derived from する (to do) with the addition of the honorific prefix な-. This prefix elevates the politeness level of the verb, indicating respect for the person performing the action.",
    "writeup": "なさる is an honorific verb that shows respect for the actions of another person, and it should **never** be used when talking about your own actions. It essentially has the same meaning as する (to do). While you can use なさる in place of する in many situations to show respect, there are nuances to consider.\n\nIt is a special-class verb with unique conjugation rules. In its plain form, it conjugates like a regular う-verb. However, in polite form, る changes to い (なさいます) instead of り, as would be expected of a typical う-verb.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Avoid using double keigo constructions like なさっていらっしゃる, as they are considered technically incorrect by some, though sometimes used. Using なさる with ます is acceptable.\n*   Some find なさる a bit old-fashioned, with お〜になる being more common in modern Japanese.\n*   Always be mindful of context when choosing honorific language.",
