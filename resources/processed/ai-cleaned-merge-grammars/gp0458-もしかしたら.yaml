    "etymology": "The phrase 「もしかしたら」 is derived from the adverb 「若し (moshi)」 meaning 'if,' the case marking particle 「か (ka)」, and 「したら (shitara)」, which is a conditional form of the verb 「する (suru)」 (to do). This structure conveys a sense of hypothetical occurrence. Variants such as 「もしかして」 and 「もしかすると」 use the te-form 「して」 and the conditional 「すると」 respectively, maintaining a similar core meaning of 'if it happens to be the case' or 'should it so happen that,' thereby expressing uncertainty or possibility.",
    "writeup": "「もしかしたら」は、不確かさや可能性を表現する副詞です。英語の \"perhaps,\" \"maybe,\" \"possibly\" といった表現に相当します。この表現は、「もしかして」や「もしかすると」といった近しい類義語と共に、仮定的な状況や潜在的な結果を導入するために機能します。他の多くの日本語の副詞と同様に、「もしかしたら」は文頭に置かれることが頻繁にあります。そして、不確かさの度合いをさらに強調するために、「かもしれない」という助動詞句と組み合わせて用いられることが多いですが、常に必須というわけではありません。「もしかしたら」は仮定的な条件を提示しますが、文全体の時制や相は、その後に続く主節によって決まります。",
