    "etymology": "The phrase 「もしかしたら」 is derived from 「若し (moshi)」 meaning 'if,' 「か (ka)」 a question particle, and 「したら (shitara)」 the conditional form of 「する (suru)」, meaning 'to do.' Literally, it translates to 'if it happens to be the case,' conveying a sense of uncertainty.",
    "writeup": "「もしかしたら」 is an adverb used to express uncertainty or possibility. It is similar to \"perhaps,\" \"maybe,\" or \"possibly\" in English. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence and is frequently used with 「かもしれない」 to further emphasize the uncertainty. The phrase suggests a hypothetical situation, implying that something *might* be true but is not certain. Remember that 「もしかしたら」 presents a hypothetical situation and is often paired with 「かもしれない」.",
