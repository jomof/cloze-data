        "nuance": "Indicates a reason or cause for what follows when attached to an adjective (い or な), and indicates a contrast when attached to a noun or な-adjective followed by the copula. It connects clauses and is primarily used in written Japanese and formal speech.",

    },
    "etymology": "The grammatical form 「なく」 is the continuative form (連用形) of the auxiliary adjective 「ない」, which expresses negation. Historically, the 連用形 of adjectives ended in 「く」, and this form allowed them to connect to other words or clauses. Thus, 「ない」 (the negative auxiliary adjective) followed this pattern, forming 「なく」. This structure enables a seamless flow between clauses, conveying a negative condition or an alternative without fully concluding the first statement. Its use in written and formal contexts highlights its classical linguistic roots.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なく」 functions as a formal and written conjunctive particle, linking two clauses. It derives from the continuative form of the negative auxiliary adjective 「ない」. This construction effectively conveys either a reason/cause or a contrast, depending on the preceding word.\n\nWhen 「なく」 attaches to an **い-adjective** (by replacing the final い with くなく, e.g., 難しい → 難しくなく), it typically introduces a reason or cause for the subsequent event or state. The meaning is akin to \"not [adjective], and as a result...\" or \"because it is not [adjective]...\".\n\nWhen 「なく」 attaches to a **な-adjective or a noun** (by using ではなく, e.g., 静か → 静かではなく, 学生 → 学生ではなく), it most commonly expresses a contrast or a denial, meaning \"not [adjective/noun], but rather...\" or \"it is not [adjective/noun]; instead, it is...\". This usage often highlights an alternative or a correction.\n\nIt is crucial to note that 「なく」 is a feature of **written Japanese and formal speech**. While it serves a similar function to the more casual 「～なくて」 or 「～ないで」, 「なく」 carries a more refined and academic tone. It is less frequently encountered in everyday casual conversation. Using 「なく」 contributes to a sophisticated and precise style of communication.",
