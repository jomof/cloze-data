meaning: Speaking of which, by the way, come to think of it
pronunciation:
  katakana: ソウイエバ
  romaji: sou ieba
formation:
  Phrase + そういえば + New topic: Used to introduce a topic that the speaker was reminded of or just thought
    of. New topic
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: General usage
  function: To introduce a topic that the speaker was reminded of or just thought of, often prompted by
    a previous statement in the conversation.
  nuance: Implies a subtle connection or sudden recollection, rather than a completely new subject. It
    softens the transition between topics.
  grammatical-role: Discourse marker
etymology: The phrase is derived from 「そう」 (like that) and 「言えば」 (if you say). The literal sense is akin
  to "if saying that," which implies recalling something triggered by a previous statement. The combination
  of 「そう」 and 「言えば」 functions as a cohesive unit to mark a sudden, prompted recollection, providing a
  smoother transition into the recalled topic than a stark topic change.
writeup: 「そういえば」 is used to introduce a topic that the speaker has just remembered or thought of, often
  prompted by something previously mentioned in the conversation. It's similar to saying "speaking of
  which," "by the way," or "come to think of it" in English. This phrase is typically used to transition
  to a **related** topic, not to introduce completely unrelated subjects. This is a subtle but important
  distinction from the English phrase "by the way." It is very similar in usage to 「といえば」, with 「そう」 simply
  replacing the direct quotation particle 「と」. You can think of it as a set phrase.
false_friends:
  - term: ところで
    meaning: By the way, incidentally
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「そういえば」 is prompted by a previous statement or current context, 「ところで」 is used to introduce
      a completely new and unrelated topic.
    grammar_point: ところで (by the way)
  - term: といえば
    meaning: Speaking of, if it were the case that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「といえば」 is used to bring up something directly related to the immediately preceding topic,
      often as a direct response. 「そういえば」 introduces something the speaker just remembered or thought
      of as a result of the conversation, not necessarily a direct response.
    grammar_point: と言えば (speaking of)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To avoid confusion, remember that 「そういえば」 is more about recalling something
  prompted by the current discussion, while 「ところで」 signals a complete change of subject. 「といえば」 is a direct
  response or association with the current topic, often reinforcing or expanding on what was just said.
  The core difference lies in the **trigger** for the new topic: for 「そういえば」 it''s a *recollection sparked
  by the context*, while for 「ところで」 it''s a *deliberate topic shift*.'

        hint: 「そういえば」 is used for a sudden recollection related to the conversation. 「ところで」 introduces
          a completely new topic. We're looking for a related memory.

          interesting.

          the subject entirely. We're recalling something related to movies.

        hint: 「そういえば」 conveys a sudden recollection or a realization prompted by the conversation. A direct

        english: Yesterday was fun, wasn't it? I was drawn to your smile.
        hint: 「そういえば」 softens a direct statement, making it sound like a fond, sudden recollection. This
          direct statement might feel too abrupt or bold. We're looking for a natural way to recall a
          personal detail.
    scene: On a first date, a man brings up a past memory that stands out to him, perhaps after a topic
      about first impressions or past events.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「そういえば」 allows a male speaker to organically weave in a personal, romantic sentiment
      like 「君 の 笑顔 に 惹か れ た ん だ」 (I was drawn to your smile). This indicates a sudden, fond recollection,
      adding a layer of authenticity and intimacy to the confession. The polite version 「あなた の 笑顔 に 惹か
      れ まし た」 would be less intimate, used in a more formal or less established relationship. It could
      also imply an indirect compliment by stating a past feeling that just resurfaced due to the conversation
      about the fun day they had together.

        hint: 「そういえば」 makes the question feel like a helpful reminder that just popped into mind. A direct

        hint: 「そういえば」 introduces a thought that suddenly occurred to the speaker, often prompted by the

  politeness required in your speech, as the surrounding phrases will adapt even if 「そういえば」 itself does
  not change.'
