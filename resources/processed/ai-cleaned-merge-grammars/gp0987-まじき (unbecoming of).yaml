jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: formal
  usage-context: Formal and stiff contexts, often found in written language or official statements.
etymology: The grammar point 「まじき」 is the attributive form of 「まじ」, an old-fashioned auxiliary verb expressing
  prohibition or strong negation. 「まじ」 itself is rarely used in modern conversation, having been largely
  replaced by 「まい」. 「まじき」 survives in formal expressions, often conveying the idea of something being
  'unforgivable' or 'unacceptable'.
writeup: The grammar point 「まじき」 is a formal expression indicating that something is unbecoming, unworthy,
  or unacceptable for a particular person or role. It carries a strong sense of disapproval or prohibition.
  The most common pattern is 「(A) に ある {まじき} (B)」, meaning "(B) is unbecoming of (A)". 「に」 can sometimes
  be replaced by 「と し て」, emphasizing the role or capacity in which the action is unacceptable. Another
  common pattern is 「許す {まじき}」, meaning "unforgivable" or "intolerable". This grammar point is generally
  used in formal writing and speech. Its rigid structure and strong condemnatory nuance make it unsuitable
  for casual conversation.

  - term: まい (won't・probably not)
    meaning: will not, do not intend to, probably not, should not, must not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「まい」 is a more common, modern equivalent for expressing negative volition or strong negative
      inference. While it can convey "should not" or "must not" similar to 「まじき」, it's broader in usage
      and not specifically tied to being "unbecoming of" a role like 「まじき」. It's often used in conjunction
      with a speaker's intention (e.g., 「もう 行く まい」 - I won't go anymore) or a negative inference (e.g.,
      「そんな こと は ある まい」 - That probably won't happen). 「まじき」 is fixed in its attributive form and specifically
      implies a failing related to a standard or expectation for a person or role.
    grammar_point: まい (won't・probably not)
  - term: べきではない (should not)
    meaning: Should not, ought not to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「べきではない」 expresses a general moral obligation or recommendation not to do something, or that
      something is inappropriate. It is a more common and versatile expression than 「まじき」. While both
      convey a sense of impropriety, 「まじき」 specifically refers to actions or qualities that are unbecoming
      or unworthy of a particular status, role, or character, carrying a stronger, often formal or literary
      condemnation.
    grammar_point: べきではない (should not)
  - term: てはならない (must not)
    meaning: Must not, cannot, should not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てはならない」 expresses a strict prohibition or strong rule, often used in official contexts or
      to state universal principles. It means 'it is forbidden to' or 'one must not'. While it shares
      the prohibitive aspect with 「まじき」, 「まじき」 focuses on the inherent nature of an action being unsuitable
      or disgraceful for a given role or position, rather than simply being a forbidden act. 「まじき」 carries
      a stronger moral or social judgment tied to one's identity.
    grammar_point: てはならない (must not)
  - term: に足りない (not worthy or sufficient)
    meaning: To not be worthy, To not be sufficient, To lack
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「に足りない」 expresses a lack of worthiness or sufficiency for a task or quality (e.g., 「信頼
      に 足りない 人」 - a person not worthy of trust), 「まじき」 carries a stronger sense of active unsuitability
      or disgrace, implying an action or quality that is explicitly improper or shameful for someone in
      a specific role or context. 「まじき」 often implies a failure to live up to a standard, while 「に足りない」
      denotes an inherent inadequacy.
    grammar_point: に足りない (not worthy or sufficient)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「まじき」 specifically highlights actions or qualities that are unsuitable for
  a particular role, status, or context, often implying a strong moral or professional judgment. It carries
  a strong sense of moral or social condemnation. In contrast, 「まい」 primarily expresses a strong negative
  intention ("will not," "do not intend to") or a negative conjecture ("probably not," "should not").
  While 「まい」 can sometimes overlap with 「まじき」 in meaning "should not," its primary function is broader
  and less about the inherent suitability to a role. 「てはならない」 and 「べきではない」 are more general prohibitions
  meaning "must not" or "should not," respectively. They indicate actions that are forbidden or not advisable,
  but lack the specific nuance of an action being fundamentally 'unbecoming' of someone's character or
  position that 「まじき」 conveys. 「に足りない」 indicates an insufficiency or lack of worth, whereas 「まじき」 implies
  an active transgression against what is proper or expected. 「まじき」 is largely confined to formal or literary
  contexts, whereas the others are used more broadly in both formal and informal speech and writing.

    scene: A team manager is explaining why a project missed its deadline to upper management.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The phrase 「リーダー に ある まじき」 signifies that the indecisiveness is not merely a personal trait,
      but a flaw that actively hinders the leader's ability to fulfill their responsibilities, affecting
      the outcome of the project.

          the remarks as unsuitable for a politician.
    scene: Political analysts are discussing a politician's recent gaffe during a televised debate.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「政治 家 と し て ある まじき」 implies that the remarks were not just inappropriate in general,
      but specifically violated the expected conduct and ethical standards of a politician, leading to
      a loss of public trust.

        english: A parent's irresponsible actions negatively impact children.
        hint: This describes a parent's actions. We need to convey that these actions are specifically
          inappropriate for someone in the role of a parent.
    scene: A family counselor is explaining the profound impact of parental behavior on child development.
    register: formal
    setting: academic

        english: To trample on a friend's trust... such an act of betrayal is absolutely unforgivable!
        hint: This uses a common expression for 'unforgivable.' We're looking for a more formal and emphatic
          way to say something is utterly unacceptable, often used in a condemnatory tone.
    scene: A woman is expressing profound disappointment and indignation to another friend after discovering
      a mutual acquaintance's severe betrayal.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「断じ て 許す まじき」 (absolutely unforgivable) is a strong, formal condemnation. While
      「わ」 is a sentence-final particle often used by female speakers to add a softer, more emotive, or
      assertive tone, its combination with 「まじき」 still conveys a weighty and definitive judgment on the
      betrayal, emphasizing its unforgivable nature despite the slightly softened ending.

    setting: storytelling

      extreme nature of the transgression.

          and strongly condemnatory expression often used for deep moral transgressions.
    scene: A philosopher is giving a lecture on ethical principles and moral boundaries.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The use of 「人間 と し て 到底 許す まじき」 conveys that the act of deceiving people for profit is a fundamental
      violation of human morality, an evil that cannot be tolerated or forgiven from any perspective,
      aligning with a philosophical discussion on ethics.

        english: Reprimanded for a nobleman's ignoble conduct, he was exiled.
        hint: This refers to a nobleman's ignoble conduct. We need an expression that emphasizes the conduct
          was specifically inappropriate or disgraceful for someone of noble status.
    scene: A historical novel describes a lord's expulsion from court due to his inappropriate behavior.
    register: bungo (literary)
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: The phrase 「貴族 に ある まじき 卑しい 振る舞い」 uses formal, somewhat archaic language to describe behavior
      that violates the expected decorum of a noble. 「咎め られ」 (reprimanded) and 「追放 さ れ た」 (was exiled)
      are strong terms that fit the historical context, highlighting the severity of the transgression
      and the formal judgment against him.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「まじき」 is used to describe actions or qualities that
  are fundamentally unsuitable for a given role, status, or expectation, often implying a strong moral
  or professional judgment. Whether it's a doctor, a leader, a politician, a parent, or even a samurai
  or an idol, the phrase highlights a severe deviation from expected conduct. The construction 「〜に ある
  まじき」 and 「〜と し て ある まじき」 both emphasize this unsuitability for a specific role. When used with a verb
  in its dictionary form like 「許す {まじき}」, it translates to "unforgivable" or "intolerable," denoting an
  heinous act that absolutely cannot be permitted.
