jlpt: N3
etymology: The word 「為 (ため)」 is fundamentally a noun meaning 'sake,' 'benefit,' or 'purpose.' Its evolution
  into a grammatical construction, often paired with the particle 「に」, reflects its capacity to express
  the intended goal of an action. Historically, the concept of 'for the sake of' naturally extended to
  denote the direct purpose or objective of a volitional act. The optional 「に」 further solidifies this
  adverbial function, clarifying that the preceding clause serves as the goal for the main action.
writeup: 'The grammatical structure 「ため(に)」 is derived from the noun 「為 (ため)」, meaning ''sake'' or ''benefit''.
  It serves to connect a preceding clause or word to a subsequent clause, indicating the **purpose** for
  which an action is performed. The presence or absence of the particle 「に」 is optional, but its inclusion
  often strengthens the sense of purpose or a direct goal-oriented relationship. This form is used when
  the action described in the main clause is a deliberate and volitional one, undertaken with a specific
  objective in mind. It typically follows: *   **Verbs in their dictionary (plain non-past) form**: For
  example, 日本語が上手になる**ため に** (in order to become good at Japanese). *   **Nouns followed by の**: For example,
  家族の**ため に** (for the sake of family). Note that the ''reason/cause'' usage of ため, such as when it follows
  plain forms of verbs in past tense, i-adjectives, or na-adjectives, is covered by the separate grammar
  point 「[Verb-casual・い-Adj・な-Adjな・Nounの]ため(に) (because of・due to)」. This grammar point focuses strictly
  on **purpose** for volitional actions. Compared to other purpose expressions like 「よう に」, 「ため(に)」 tends
  to be more formal and objective, clearly stating the direct goal or aim. It implies a conscious decision
  to act in a certain way to achieve a specific outcome.'

  - term: のに
    meaning: although; in spite of; despite
    kind: similar expression

    grammar_point: のに (unexpected result)
  - term: には
    meaning: in order to; in regard to; for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に は」 focuses more on conditions or requirements that are necessary for something to happen,

      verbs of potential or ability, or for requests/instructions.
    grammar_point: ように (purpose or desired state)
  - term: Verb+にいく
    meaning: to go to do something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ため(に)」 states a general purpose for an action, 「Verb+にいく」 specifically indicates going
      somewhere *in order to do* something.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]に行く (to go in order to do)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share some conceptual overlap with 「ため(に)」, recognizing
  their distinct nuances is crucial for accurate and natural Japanese. This 「ため(に)」 specifically serves
  as a versatile tool for stating **purpose**, emphasizing the direct connection between a volitional
  action and its goal. Other expressions might imply conditions, indirect goals, or different levels of
  formality. Pay close attention to the connotation, formality, and specific type of purpose relationship
  each expression conveys.

          deeper purpose of traveling.

        hint: Omitting 「ため に」 and only using 「の」 would simply connect 'development' and 'research' as

          looking for the purpose.
    scene: A scientist presents their work at a conference.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: This example uses 「Noun の ため に」 to express the purpose, specifically for the beneficiary/goal

        hint: 「よう に」 often implies an indirect goal or a change in state or ability, like 'so that one
          can do X'. 「ため に」 more directly states the purpose or objective for the action. We're looking
          for the direct purpose.
    scene: A trainer explains a client's routine to a new team member.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「健康 を 維持 する ため に」 clearly states the purpose of the daily exercise. This usage is common in

        hint: 「せい で」 implies a negative reason or blame, suggesting the tuition fees are a burden causing
          her to work. 「ため に」 is neutral and simply states the purpose of her work. We're looking for
          a neutral statement of purpose.
    scene: A student talks about their financial situation to a classmate.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「学費 の ため に」 clearly indicates that her part-time work is for the purpose of covering tuition
      fees. This is a common and relatable reason for students. The casual polite form 「アルバイト を し て い
      ます」 is appropriate for a friendly conversation.
post_example_writeup: When using 「ため(に)」 for purpose, the main clause describes a deliberate, volitional
  action undertaken to achieve a specific goal. This grammar point specifically applies to verbs in their
  dictionary form and nouns followed by の. Remember that the 'reason/cause' usage of ため is covered by
  a separate grammar point, so always ensure the context implies a clear, intentional purpose.
