    "etymology": "「抜きで」 comes from the noun form 「抜き」 (nuki) of the verb 「抜く」 (nuku), meaning \"to extract\" or \"to leave out,\" combined with the particle 「で」 (de), indicating means or manner. Thus, it literally means \"by means of extracting\" or \"in a state of leaving out.\"",
    "writeup": "「抜きで」 is constructed from the noun form 「抜き」 (from the verb 「抜く」, \"to extract\") and the particle 「で」. It indicates that something is done \"without\" something else, or \"with the removal of\" something. Because 「抜き」 indicates extraction, this grammar pattern is primarily used to mean \"leaving out\" or \"setting aside\" something that is usually included.\n\n「抜きで」 acts as a suffix and follows nouns to indicate what is being left out. Both the plain hiragana and kanji forms are common. 「の」 replaces 「で」 when 「抜き」 is followed directly by another noun. For instance, 「ワサビ抜きのお寿司」 (sushi without wasabi).\n\n「にして」 may also replace 「で」, especially when the second part of the sentence includes 「ない」 or 「できない」. These expressions indicate something \"will not happen without (A)\" or \"is not possible without (A).\"\n\nAdditionally, 「抜きには」 is often used with a negative verb, emphasizing that something cannot be achieved without the specified element. 「抜きで」 or 「抜きでは」 may also appear in negative sentences with the same basic meaning.",
