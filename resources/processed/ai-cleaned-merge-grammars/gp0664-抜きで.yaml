    "etymology": "「抜きで」comes from the noun form of the verb 「抜く (ぬく)」, meaning \"to extract\" or \"to remove,\" combined with the particle 「で」. The etymology reflects the core meaning of leaving something out or doing something without a particular element.",
    "writeup": "「抜きで」 is a construction that indicates something is done \"without (A)\" or \"with the removal of (A).\" The noun 「抜き (ぬき)」 comes from the verb 「抜く (ぬく)」, which means \"to extract.\" This grammar pattern is primarily used to indicate 'leaving out' or 'setting aside' something that is regularly included.\n\n「抜きで」 acts as a suffix, so it's used after nouns to indicate the thing that is being left out. Both the plain hiragana and kanji forms are fairly common. 「の」 will replace 「で」 when 「ぬき」 is followed directly by another noun. 「にして」 may also replace 「で」, but this structure is more common when the part (B) section of the sentence includes a 「ない」 or 「できない」 based statement. These expressions indicate that something \"will not happen without (A)\" or \"is not possible without (A).\" However, 「ぬきで」 or 「ぬきでは」 may also appear in negative sentences, with the same meaning.",
