        "Register": "Varies depending on the politeness level used.",
        "Usage": "Used when someone *gives* something to the speaker or someone in the speaker's in-group. The person giving must be of equal or lower status.",
        "Counterpoint": "Contrast with 「あげる」, which is used when the speaker gives to someone else, and 「もらう」, which is used when the speaker *receives* something.",

        "[Person] が/は + [Speaker/In-Group Member] に + [Object] を + 呉れる/くれる": "Someone gives something to the speaker or someone closely associated with the speaker."
    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「くれる」 originally comes from the verb 「暗くれる (くれくれる)」, which meant \"to become dark\" or \"to set (of the sun).\" Over time, it took on the nuance of *bestowing* something, similar to how the setting sun *gives* way to darkness.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「呉れる・くれる」 means \"to give,\" but it is used specifically when someone is giving something **to you** (the speaker) or someone closely associated with you (like a family member or close friend). It emphasizes the benefit received by the speaker. This is a **key distinction** from 「あげる」, which is used when *you* are giving something to someone else, and 「もらう」, which means \"to receive.\"\n\n「くれる」 is used when the giver is typically of **equal or lower status** than the receiver. Using 「くれる」 often implies a sense of gratitude from the speaker. While the kanji 「呉」 is used to write 呉れる, it is very common to see this verb written in hiragana as 「くれる」, particularly in less formal contexts or for ease of reading.\n\nRemember that 「くれる」 always involves the speaker or someone close to them *receiving* something. Always consider the direction of the action and the relative status of the individuals involved to correctly choose between 「くれる」, 「あげる」, and 「もらう」.",

            "etymology": "「友だち (ともだち)」 means friend. 「プレゼント」 is a loan word from English, and 「くれた」 is the past tense of 「くれる」.",
            "nuance": "「友だち」 giving a 「プレゼント」 is a common scenario among friends. The use of 「くれた」 emphasizes that the speaker received the gift."

            "nuance": "Using 「呉れました」 shows respect, even though the speaker's mother would typically be of higher status. This use implies the speaker is simply stating a fact, showing appreciation for the gift without explicitly elevating the mother's status through an honorific verb like くださる, which might be too formal in this context."
