    "etymology": "The grammar point 「じゃない」 is a contraction of 「ではない」. 「では」 is the topic marker 「は」 attached to 「で」, which is the te-form of the copula 「だ」 (to be). 「ない」 is the negative auxiliary verb. This grammatical evolution reflects the natural simplification and contraction of common linguistic forms in spoken Japanese over time.",
    "writeup": "「じゃない」 is the casual form of 「ではない」. 「では」 is often contracted to 「じゃ」 in Japanese. 「じゃない」 (casual) or 「ではない」 (semi-polite) are used to create the negative form of nouns and な-adjectives. **It is important to note that 「じゃない」 cannot be used with い-adjectives.** These structures are simply added to the base form of the noun or な-adjective. 「じゃ」 and 「では」 can also be used with the negative ます form of 「ある」, to create the polite variant 「じゃありません」. 「じゃない」 is also frequently used to ask questions, much like 「じゃないか」. However, 「じゃない」 as a question is a little more blunt, like \"isn't it?\" in English, while 「じゃないか」 is closer to \"don't you think?\". When 「じゃない」 is used as a question, it is usually obvious from the rising intonation. This form is common in casual conversations, often used to seek confirmation or express a mild surprise or realization.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「じゃない」 serves as a direct negation for nouns and な-adjectives, it is crucial to differentiate it from other related expressions. 「だ」 and 「です」 are used for affirmation, meaning they state what something *is*. The verb ending 「～ない」, though also a negative form, is specifically for verbs, negating actions rather than nominal states. When forming questions, 「じゃないか」 offers a softer, more inviting nuance compared to the more direct questioning tone of 「じゃない」 with rising intonation. Lastly, 「じゃなかった」 is simply the past tense of 「じゃない」, indicating negation in the past.",
