meaning: please give me
pronunciation:
  katakana: クダサイ
  romaji: kudasai
formation:
  Noun + を + ください: Used to politely ask for a noun.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The word 「ください」 comes from the verb 「くださる」 (kudasaru), which is the honorific equivalent of
  「くれる」 (kureru), meaning "to give (to me or my in-group)". The imperative form 「ください」 thus directly translates
  to "please give (me)". Its use with 「を」 to request objects is a fundamental aspect of transactional
  language in Japanese, emphasizing the polite request for an item to be given to the speaker.
writeup: 「[Noun]をください」 is a fundamental and polite way to request an object in Japanese. It directly translates
  to "Please give me [Noun]." This construction is widely used in daily interactions, such as ordering
  food, asking for items in a store, or requesting things from friends and family. The particle 「を」 clearly
  marks the preceding noun as the direct object of the verb 「ください」, indicating what is being requested.
  While simple, its polite nature makes it suitable for most situations. For more casual contexts among
  close friends, one might drop 「ください」 and simply state the noun, sometimes followed by a rising intonation
  or a casual particle like 「ね」 or 「な」. However, 「[Noun]をください」 remains the standard polite form. It's
  important to remember that 「ください」 is specifically used for the listener giving something to the speaker
  or the speaker's in-group. It cannot be used for the speaker giving something to the listener.

  - term: をくれますか
    meaning: Will you give me...?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a question, seeking confirmation or willingness, rather than a direct command. 「ください」
      is a direct request.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て]くれるか (will you do for me)
  - term: をあげます
    meaning: I will give (to you/out-group)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「あげます」 is used when the speaker gives something to someone else. 「ください」 is used when the speaker
      receives something from someone else. The direction of the giving/receiving is opposite.
    grammar_point: あげる・やる (to give, outward)
  - term: を下さい
    meaning: Please give me (written form)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the same grammar point, but written using kanji for 「下さい」. While common, 「ください」 in
      hiragana is also very frequent, especially in more general contexts, and is often preferred for
      its softness or when the request is not literally about "receiving."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ください (hiragana for requests)
post_false_friends_writeup: Be careful not to confuse 「ください」 with forms like 「くれますか」 or 「あげます」. While
  all relate to giving and receiving, 「ください」 is a direct polite request for something to be given to the
  speaker. 「くれますか」 is a question asking if someone will give something. 「あげます」 is used when the speaker
  gives something to another person. The crucial difference lies in the direction of the action. Also,
  「ください」 is often written in hiragana to distinguish it from its original kanji usage as the imperative
  of the verb 「下さる」 (to give downwards), emphasizing its fixed usage as a request form rather than the
  literal act of lowering something.
