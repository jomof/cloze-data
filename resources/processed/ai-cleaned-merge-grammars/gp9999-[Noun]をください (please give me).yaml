jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: To make a direct, polite request for an object or an abstract concept (like information).
  nuance: This is a polite and direct way to ask for something. It is very common in transactional settings
    like shops or restaurants. While polite, it can sound slightly demanding if not accompanied by a friendly
    tone or context, as it is a direct command. It literally means 'please give (to me/us)'.
etymology: The verb ください is the imperative form of くださる (kudasaru), which is an honorific verb meaning
  'to give' (from a superior to an inferior, or from someone to the speaker/in-group). Over time, its
  use became generalized as a polite imperative for requests, both for actions (when preceded by a te-form
  verb) and for objects (when preceded by a direct object particle を and a noun). Its origin as a verb
  indicating direction of giving (to the speaker) reinforces its function as 'give (to me)'.
writeup: The expression 「〜をください」 is a fundamental phrase used to politely request an object or item in
  Japanese. It directly translates to "Please give me ~" or "I'll have ~". It is widely used in various
  daily situations, particularly in transactional settings like shops, cafes, and restaurants. To use
  this phrase, you simply place the noun of the item you want, followed by the direct object particle
  を, and then ください. For example, if you want a coffee, you would say 「コーヒーをください」 (Koohii o kudasai). If
  you want water, it's 「水をください」 (Mizu o kudasai). While 「ください」 itself is a polite imperative form, its
  directness means that the tone and context are important. In a friendly shop or casual setting, it sounds
  perfectly natural and polite. However, in more formal or distant interactions, you might consider softening
  your tone or adding other polite expressions. For instance, sometimes 「〜をお願いします」 (onegai shimasu) is
  used, which can feel slightly softer or more general when requesting something or a service. It's important
  to remember that 「〜をください」 is specifically for requesting *objects* or *items*. It is not used to request
  an action from someone. For requesting an action, a different grammatical structure involving the te-form
  of a verb is used, such as 「〜て ください」 (please do ~). The distinction between requesting an object versus
  an action is crucial for correct usage.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[て] + ください
    meaning: Please do (verb)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both use 「ください」, this construction requests an action to be performed (e.g., 「座って ください」
      - Please sit down), whereas 「[Noun]をください」 requests a tangible item or object to be given.
    grammar_point: てください (polite request)
  - term: お願いします
    meaning: Please; I request (a favor or service)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「お願いします」 is a more general and often softer request, typically used when asking for a service,
      favor, or assistance, or when making a general plea (e.g., 「手伝って お願いします」 - Please help). 「〜をください」
      is specifically for requesting a concrete item or object.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:お願いする (to request ask for)
  - term: 頂戴
    meaning: Give me (informal, often feminine or for children)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「頂戴」 is a much more casual and informal way to ask for something, often used by women or children,
      or in very familiar contexts. It implies a direct command, and while polite in some specific contexts
      (like between close family), it lacks the general politeness of 「ください」 for broader use.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:頂戴 (informal request for item)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key to distinguishing these expressions lies in what is being requested.
  If you are asking for an action to be performed, use the te-form of the verb followed by 「ください」. If
  you are asking for a tangible item, use the noun followed by を and 「ください」. While 「お願いします」 can sometimes
  be used in place of 「〜をください」, especially in softer contexts or when the request is less about a specific
  item and more about a general transaction (like "Check, please" at a restaurant, which is often 「お会計
  お願いします」), remember that 「〜をください」 is the direct and clear way to ask for an item.
