        "Verb[masu-stem] + やがる": "Expresses scorn or disdain towards someone's action."
    },
    "jlpt": "N0",
    "meaning": "To have the nerve to (do something), to have the gall to (do something), to freaking (do something)",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Colloquial, mostly used by men.",
        "Usage": "Expresses the speaker's strong negative feelings (scorn, anger, disdain) towards someone else's actions. It is considered vulgar."
    },
    "etymology": "やがる is derived from the verb 「上がる」 (agaru, to rise/go up), which evolved into expressing completion or finality of an action. Over time, it acquired a nuance of contempt, as if the action was 'carried out to the very end' in a vexing manner. The shift in meaning is subtle but significant, turning a statement of fact into an expression of anger or disdain. It can also be a contraction of 「ている+あがる」.",
    "writeup": "「やがる」 is a colloquial expression, primarily used by men, to express strong negative feelings such as scorn, disdain, or anger towards someone else's actions. It's considered quite vulgar and should be used with caution. It is often translated as \"to have the nerve to (do something)\" or \"to freaking (do something)\".\n\nIt attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. For example, with the verb 「する」 (to do), it becomes 「しやがる」. It can also be used as the て-form of a verb + 「やがる」 as an abbreviation of 「ている+あがる」. However, the meaning remains the same.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   This expression is very strong and can be offensive. Avoid using it in formal situations or with people you don't know well.\n*   While primarily used by men, it *can* be used by women, but this is less common and might come across as even more vulgar or aggressive.\n*   It is not typically used to describe one's own actions, but rather the actions of others that irritate or offend the speaker.",
