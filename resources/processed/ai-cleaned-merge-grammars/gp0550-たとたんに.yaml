    },
    "etymology": "The term 「途端」 (totan) is a compound of 「途」 (to), meaning 'way' or 'road', and 「端」 (tan), meaning 'edge' or 'tip'. Thus, it literally conveys the sense of being 'at the very edge' or 'on the tip' of something. When combined with the past tense verb form (た-form) and the particle 「に」, it emphasizes the immediate succession of events, as if one action is followed by another without any discernible pause, right at the 'tip' of the preceding action. The 「に」 particle functions adverbially, reinforcing this sense of immediate timing.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「たとたんに」 (tatotanni), often written with kanji as 「た途端に」, is used to express that an action or event occurs immediately after another, with a sense of **immediacy and often unexpectedness**. It conveys that 'the moment' or 'the instant' one thing happened, another followed almost simultaneously or without any perceptible delay. The construction is formed by attaching 「途端に」 to the past tense (た-form) of a verb. The subsequent event described (B in the pattern 'A た途端に B') is typically something that is beyond the speaker's direct control, surprising, or coincidental. The abruptness implied by 「途端」, literally meaning 'at the tip' or 'at the very end', highlights that the two events are so closely linked in time that the second seems to spring directly from the first. It is crucial to remember that 「たとたんに」 cannot be used directly with nouns or adjectives; it must follow a verb in its past plain form.",
