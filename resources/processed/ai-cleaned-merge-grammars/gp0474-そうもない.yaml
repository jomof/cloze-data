    "etymology": "The grammar point 「そうもない」 is derived from 「そう」 (appearance, seeming), 「も」 (particle indicating emphasis or surprise), and 「ない」 (negative). Thus, it literally means \"not even appearing like that,\" conveying a strong sense of improbability.",
    "writeup": "The grammatical expression 「そうもない」 conveys a strong sense that something is highly improbable or appears impossible. It is a compound form, combining 「そう」 (indicating appearance or seeming), the adverbial particle 「も」 (which adds emphasis, akin to \"even\"), and the adjective 「ない」 (denoting negation). Consequently, 「そうもない」 literally translates to \"not even appearing as such,\" with the 「も」 emphasizing the surprising lack of appearance. This structure typically attaches to the stem form of verbs. It is particularly common when used with potential verbs, in which case it strongly implies that an action is impossible or that there is no chance of it being performed. This expression carries a notably stronger nuance of impossibility compared to 「そうにない」.",
