    "etymology": "The grammatical expression 「そうもない」 is derived from the auxiliary verb 「そう」 (indicating appearance or seeming), the adverbial particle 「も」 (which adds emphasis, akin to \"even\"), and the i-adjective 「ない」 (denoting negation). Thus, it literally means \"not even appearing like that,\" conveying a strong sense of improbability or impossibility. The presence of 「も」 enhances the sense of extreme unlikelihood.",
    "writeup": "The grammatical expression 「そうもない」 conveys a strong sense that something is highly improbable or appears impossible. It is a compound form, combining 「そう」 (indicating appearance or seeming), the adverbial particle 「も」 (which adds emphasis, akin to \"even\"), and the adjective 「ない」 (denoting negation). Consequently, 「そうもない」 literally translates to \"not even appearing as such,\" with the 「も」 emphasizing the surprising lack of appearance. This structure typically attaches to the stem form of verbs.\n\nThis expression carries a notably stronger nuance of impossibility compared to 「そうにない」. While 「そうにない」 simply indicates a lack of signs or general unlikelihood, 「そうもない」 uses 「も」 to add a layer of emphasis, making the impossibility seem more definitive or surprising.\n\n「そうもない」 is particularly common when used with potential verbs, in which case it strongly implies that an action is impossible or that there is no chance of it being performed. When combined with potential forms, it often translates to phrases like \"there's no way I can...\" or \"it doesn't stand a chance of...\", highlighting an apparent inability.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing 「そうもない」 from similar expressions, consider the degree of unlikelihood and the basis for that judgment. 「そうもない」 emphasizes that something *appears* or *looks* impossible, often due to observable circumstances, and carries a strong, emphatic tone due to 「も」. In contrast, 「そうにない」 is a milder version, suggesting a lack of signs or general unlikelihood.\n\nExpressions like 「っこない」, 「はずがない」, and 「わけがない」 also denote impossibility but with different nuances: 「っこない」 is highly colloquial and very forceful, used for definitive impossibility; 「はずがない」 implies impossibility based on logical expectation or common sense; and 「わけがない」 indicates a factual or inherent impossibility. 「ようがない」 focuses on the lack of a means or method to achieve something, making it practically impossible.",
