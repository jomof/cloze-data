    "etymology": "The grammar point 「そうもない」 is derived from 「そう」 (appearance, seeming), 「も」 (particle indicating emphasis or surprise), and 「ない」 (negative). Thus, it literally means \"not even appearing like that,\" conveying a strong sense of improbability.",
    "writeup": "「そうもない」 expresses a strong sense of something being very unlikely or not seeming possible. It's a combination of 「そう」 (appearance), the adverbial particle 「も」 (emphasis), and the adjective 「ない」 (negative). Therefore, 「そうもない」 literally translates to \"not even appearing like (A).\" It's often used with potential verbs to strongly imply that something is impossible or has no chance of happening. It carries a stronger nuance than 「そうにない」.",
