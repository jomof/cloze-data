    "etymology": "「そうもない」 is composed of 「そう」 (appearance, seeming), the particle 「も」 (emphasis), and 「ない」 (not). Thus, it literally means 'not even appearing like that.'",
    "writeup": "「そうもない」 is used with verbs to express that something is very unlikely to happen. It's a combination of the auxiliary verb 「そう」 (appearance), the adverbial particle 「も」 (emphasis), and the negative い-adjective 「ない」. 「そう」 highlights appearance, so 「そうもない」 literally means \"it doesn't even appear like (A).\" It follows the potential form of a verb.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   「そうもない」 is stronger than 「そうにない」 because 「も」 emphasizes the unlikelihood.\n*   It's often used with potential verbs to convey a strong feeling that something is not possible, similar to \"not standing a chance of doing (A).\"",
