details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used for direct, plain negation of actions or states. Forms the basis for many other
    negative grammatical structures.
  function: Expresses that an an action is not or will not be performed, or that a state does not exist.
  nuance: Implies a simple, factual absence of action or state without additional politeness or formality.
    Can also convey a strong, direct refusal depending on intonation.
  grammatical-role: Attaches to verb stems to create their plain negative form.
etymology: The negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 evolved from the classical Japanese negative auxiliary 「ず」
  (later 「ぬ」). In the Heian period, 「ぬ」 became 「ない」 through a process of sound change, specifically through
  the conjunctive form 「なく」 which then developed into 「ない」 when used as a predicate. This historical link
  explains why 「ない」 behaves grammatically like an い-adjective, able to conjugate further (e.g., 「なかった」,
  「なくて」). Its fundamental meaning of "absence" or "non-existence" has remained consistent, forming the
  core of negation in modern Japanese.
writeup: |-
  The plain negative form of verbs, ending in 「ない」, is a fundamental grammatical component in Japanese. It is used to express that an action is not being performed, will not be performed, or that a state does not exist. This form is central to casual speech and writing, and it also serves as a base for constructing many more complex grammatical expressions.

  Forming the plain negative depends on the verb group:
  *   **Godan Verbs (Group 1)**: For these verbs, the last character (which is in the う-column) is changed to its corresponding あ-column, and then 「ない」 is appended. For example, 読む (yomu, to read) becomes 読まない (yomanai, do not read). A special consideration is for verbs ending in 「う」 (e.g., 買う - kau, to buy), where 「う」 changes to 「わ」 before 「ない」 is added, making it 買わない (kawanai, do not buy). Another notable exception is 行く (iku, to go), which uniquely becomes 行かない (ikanai, do not go) instead of いかない.
  *   **Ichidan Verbs (Group 2)**: For Ichidan verbs, the process is simpler: the final 「る」 is dropped, and 「ない」 is directly attached. For example, 食べる (taberu, to eat) becomes 食べない (tabenai, do not eat).
  *   **Irregular Verbs**: The two irregular verbs, する (suru, to do) and 来る (kuru, to come), have unique negative forms: しない (shinai, do not do) and こない (konai, do not come), respectively.

  Because 「ない」 functions grammatically like an い-adjective, it can be conjugated further into forms like the past tense (なかった), the te-form (なくて), or for conditional statements. Understanding this basic negative form is crucial for effective communication in Japanese, as it forms the basis for expressing inability, prohibition, and various nuances of negation.
false_friends:
  - term: ないことには〜ない
    meaning: Unless ~ will not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 'While both involve negation, 「ないことには〜ない」 expresses a necessary condition: unless something
      happens, something else won''t happen. It''s a conditional negation, not a simple statement of non-action.'
    grammar_point: ないことには〜ない (unless ~ will not)
  - term: てはいけない
    meaning: Must not; may not; cannot.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てはいけない」 expresses prohibition or a strong rule against doing something. In contrast, the
      plain negative 「ない」 simply states that an action is not done or will not be done, without implying
      prohibition.
    grammar_point: てはいけない (must not・cannot)
  - term: じゃない
    meaning: Is not, Isn't (for nouns and な-adjectives)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「じゃない」 is the plain negative form for nouns and な-adjectives, whereas the 「ない」 form discussed
      here is specifically for verbs. They negate different parts of speech.
    grammar_point: じゃない (negation noun and na-adj)
  - term: ざるを得ない
    meaning: Can't help doing, have no choice but to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expression conveys a sense of unavoidable necessity or compulsion to do something, despite
      possibly not wanting to. It's a much stronger, more complex nuance than a simple verb negation.
    grammar_point: ざるを得ない (have no choice but to)
post_false_friends_writeup: It is important to distinguish the simple plain negative 「ない」 from other negative
  expressions that add layers of meaning like prohibition, necessity, or specific conditional relationships.
  While 「ない」 is a direct statement of non-action or non-existence, constructions like 「ないことには〜ない」 and
  「てはいけない」 introduce conditions or commands. Also, be careful not to confuse verb negation with the negation
  of nouns and な-adjectives using 「じゃない」, as they apply to different word types. The choice depends on
  whether you are simply stating a fact, imposing a rule, or expressing compulsion.

      makes it a gentle plea suitable for an older female speaking to a younger male, emphasizing care.
      「心配なさらないでください」 is a more respectful option using the honorific for the verb, making the request
      even softer.

    setting: instructional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: A common way to give a polite negative instruction from a position of authority, suitable

          - 読ま なかっ たら、分から ない。
        english: If you didn't read (in the past), you won't understand (now).
        hint: This conditional form implies a past condition, whereas the example implies a general truth
          or future condition.

    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: Demonstrates the plain negative in a conditional 「と」 clause, indicating a natural consequence.
      「読まなければ」 uses the more common `ば` conditional for general truths or negative conditions, which is
      often interchangeable with 「と」 in this context.
  - english: He doesn't know how to swim.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 泳げ ない。
        english: He cannot swim (he lacks the ability).
        hint: This expresses the physical inability to swim (potential form), whereas 「知らない」 indicates
          a lack of knowledge about how to swim.
    scene: Describing someone's skill.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

      or skill. 「知りません」 is the polite form.
  - english: We don't accept credit cards here.
    japanese:
      - ここ で は クレジット カード を {使わ ない}。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ で は クレジット カード が 使え ませ ん。
        english: Credit cards cannot be used here.
        hint: This uses the potential negative, implying a rule makes it impossible, rather than a stated
          policy of not using them.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ で は クレジット カード の ご 利用 は でき ませ ん。
        english: Credit card usage is not possible here (more formal).
        hint: This is a more formal way of stating the inability to use credit cards, often seen in official
          signage.
    scene: A shop employee informing a customer.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: Used to state a general rule or policy, often heard in professional settings to clearly communicate
      what is not done or allowed. 「使いません」 is the polite counterpart to 「使わない」, maintaining the same meaning
      but at a higher register.
post_example_writeup: The plain negative form is highly versatile and serves as a foundational component
  for many more complex grammatical structures in Japanese. Mastering its formation and various contextual
  uses is key to achieving fluency in casual conversation and understanding more nuanced expressions.
  Pay close attention to how it combines with other particles and grammatical patterns to convey different
  meanings, such as requests, conditions, or reasons.
