        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used to express that something applies to a wide range of things or situations, not just the ones mentioned.",
        "function": "Emphasizes the comprehensiveness of the statement.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the mentioned items are merely representative examples of a broader category, signifying that the statement holds true for all members of that category.",
        "source": "DOJG",
        "counterpoint": "Often contrasted with simple enumeration using particles like も (mo) or や (ya), as と言わず〜と言わず implies a more exhaustive or pervasive applicability.",
        "grammatical-role": "This phrase functions as a comprehensive modifier, indicating the scope or extent of the preceding statement."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「言わず~と言わず」 literally means \"without saying A, without saying B.\" It implies that the mentioned items are just examples and there's no need to explicitly state everything covered. The '言わず' part is the imperfective form of the verb '言う' (iu, to say), implying 'without saying' or 'without mentioning'.",
    "writeup": "The grammatical pattern 「言わず~と言わず」 is employed to convey that a statement or action applies not merely to the specific items mentioned, but broadly and comprehensively to all items within a given category. It highlights the universality or pervasive nature of the situation, often implying that the items listed are just a few prominent examples among many. This structure is particularly effective when you want to emphasize that something is true across an entire spectrum, leaving no exceptions.\n\nWhile the grammar point name `Verb[imperfective]+言わず~と言わず` includes 'Verb[imperfective]', it is predominantly used with nouns. The '言わず' itself is the imperfective form of the verb '言う' (iu, to say), meaning 'without saying'. However, the pattern typically connects two representative nouns to illustrate a broader range.",

                    "mitigation": "「壁も窓も」 simply lists two items, implying an additive nature. The scene's description of the room being '埋め尽くされていた' (completely filled) suggests a pervasive extent that goes beyond just two specific surfaces, thus subtly guiding the user towards the comprehensive nuance of {と言わず~と言わず}."

The scene, emphasizing 'ひたすら' (single-mindedly/diligently), helps evoke this continuous and exhaustive effort, making {と言わず~と言わず} the more fitting choice."
