        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used to express that something applies to a wide range of things or situations, not just the ones mentioned.",
        "function": "Emphasizes the comprehensiveness of the statement.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the mentioned items are merely representative examples of a broader category, signifying that the statement holds true for all members of that category.",
        "source": "DOJG",
        "counterpoint": "Often contrasted with simple enumeration using particles like も (mo) or や (ya), as と言わず〜と言わず implies a more exhaustive or pervasive applicability.",
        "grammatical-role": "This phrase functions as a comprehensive modifier, indicating the scope or extent of the preceding statement."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「言わず~と言わず」 literally means \"without saying A, without saying B.\" It implies that the mentioned items are just examples and there's no need to explicitly state everything covered. The '言わず' part is the imperfective form of the verb '言う' (iu, to say), implying 'without saying' or 'without mentioning'.",
    "writeup": "The grammatical pattern 「言わず~と言わず」 is employed to convey that a statement or action applies not merely to the specific items mentioned, but broadly and comprehensively to all items within a given category. It highlights the universality or pervasive nature of the situation, often implying that the items listed are just a few prominent examples among many. This structure is particularly effective when you want to emphasize that something is true across an entire spectrum, leaving no exceptions.\n\nWhile the grammar point name may include 'Verb[imperfective]' in its broader classification (due to '言わず' being a verb form), this pattern is predominantly used by connecting two representative **nouns** to illustrate a broader range.",

            "nuance": "While 「〜はもちろん」 also introduces something obvious, it emphasizes that something else is also true, often something unexpected or surprising, unlike 「言わず~と言わず」 which stresses the comprehensive applicability across a range of items."

            "nuance": "Unlike 「言わず~と言わず」, 「〜から〜まで」 specifies clear start and end points, whereas 「言わず~と言わず」 uses two examples to imply a broader, often exhaustive, set without explicit boundaries."

            "nuance": "While 「〜にかかわらず」 also suggests comprehensiveness, it implies that a situation holds true irrespective of differences between specified items. 「言わず~と言わず」 uses the items as representative examples of a broader set where the characteristic is universally true."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「言うまでもなく」 and 「〜はもちろん」 might appear similar, they carry distinct nuances. 「言うまでもなく」 is used for stating facts that are considered self-evident. 「〜はもちろん」 serves to highlight an obvious inclusion while also pointing to something less obvious. In contrast, 「言わず~と言わず」 specifically emphasizes that a characteristic or action is universally true for a broad category, using specific examples to illustrate this all-encompassing nature. Similarly, while 「〜から〜まで」 indicates a clear range, 「言わず~と言わず」 implies a pervasive presence without strict boundaries, and 「〜にかかわらず」 focuses on something being true irrespective of listed items, whereas 「言わず~と言わず」 uses them as representative of a complete set.",
