pronunciation:
  katakana: ヨウ ト オモウ
  romaji: yō to omou
formation:
  Verb[volitional-form] + と思う: Expresses the speaker's intention or decision to do something surfaces
    as a thought or internal resolve. This structure is often translated as 'I think I will...', 'I'm
    going to...', or 'I intend to...' and signifies a personal decision or plan that has formed in the
    speaker's mind. It implies a conscious consideration rather than an immediate, spontaneous action
    or an unchangeable, rigid commitment. It is highly versatile and fits various daily conversational
    contexts, reflecting an internal thought process before action.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: This structure is used to express one's intention or decision. It implies a personal
    thought process leading to a planned action or resolution, rather than a mere factual statement of
    a plan. It can convey varying degrees of firmness, from a tentative idea to a strong resolve, depending
    on the context and auxiliary verbs used, such as the progressive 'ている' form for ongoing intentions.
  function: Expresses intention, decision, or personal resolution.
  nuance: Differs from a simple statement of 'will' or 'plan' by emphasizing the thought process or internal
    decision-making. It suggests that the speaker has considered the action and decided to pursue it.
    The politeness level can be adjusted by conjugating 思う.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a main predicate, indicating the speaker's mental state concerning a
    future action or ongoing intention.
  logical-flow: Typically follows a sequence of thought leading to a conclusion or plan. It often implies
    a reason or trigger for the intention that precedes the statement.
  temporal-flow: Primarily refers to future actions or ongoing intentions. The past tense of 思う (思った)
    indicates a decision made in the past. The progressive form (思っている) indicates an intention that is
    currently held or ongoing.
  spatial-flow: Not directly related to spatial flow, but the intention expressed may involve movement
    or location, as illustrated in examples like going to the park or traveling overseas. The focus remains
    on the internal state rather than external movement.
etymology: The phrase combines the volitional form of a verb (意向形, ikōkei), which historically evolved
  from forms expressing desire or potential, with the verb 思う (omou), meaning 'to think' or 'to feel'.
  The volitional form itself signifies an internal drive or intention. By attaching 思う, the expression
  explicitly frames this internal drive as a thought or decision. This construction highlights that the
  speaker is consciously processing and forming an intention. For instance, 行こう (ikō, let's go/I shall
  go) inherently contains an intention. Adding と思う specifies that this intention is a thought or a resolve
  held by the speaker, distinguishing it from a mere suggestion to others or a spontaneous urge. The particle
  と acts as a quotative marker, indicating that the volitional form is being 'thought' or 'quoted' internally
  by the speaker.
writeup: |-
  The structure Verb[volitional-form] + と思う is a fundamental expression in Japanese used to convey the speaker's intention, decision, or personal resolve to do something. It is best translated as "I think I will...", "I'm going to...", or "I intend to...". This phrase emphasizes that the action is a result of the speaker's own thought process and decision, rather than a mere statement of fact or an external obligation. It is a very common and versatile expression in Japanese, widely used in everyday conversations.

  While the volitional form alone (e.g., 行こう) can express a strong will or an invitation, adding と思う softens this directness by framing it as an internal thought. This makes the expression more personal and less assertive, allowing for nuance. For example, 「行こう」 might sound like a command or a very direct proposal, whereas 「行こう と 思う」 expresses a personal decision without imposing it on others.

  The conjugation of 思う determines the tense and politeness of the entire expression. For an ongoing intention or a plan that is still being considered, the progressive form 「思っている」 (or its casual contraction 「思ってる」) is frequently used. This highlights that the intention is not just a fleeting thought but a current state of mind. For decisions made in the past, the past tense 「思った」 is used.

  This grammar point is suitable for both casual and polite contexts, depending on whether 思う is used in its plain form (思う) or polite form (思います).
false_friends:
  - term: てみる
    meaning: To try to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike Verb[volitional-form] + と思う, てみる expresses an attempt to do something, focusing on
      the act of trying rather than a planned intention or decision.
    grammar_point: てみる (try and see)
  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]
    meaning: Let's, I shall (Casual volitional)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike Verb[volitional-form] + と思う, the volitional form alone is a direct expression of volition
      or invitation, lacking the nuance of 'thinking about' it. It's more direct and can imply inviting
      someone else or a firm, unadorned resolution.
    grammar_point: (よ)う (let’s, shall we)
  - term: と思う
    meaning: I think
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike Verb[volitional-form] + と思う, which expresses an intention, 「と 思う」 on its own (with
      a non-volitional verb) simply conveys an opinion or belief about something, not an intention to
      act. For example, 「彼 は 来る と 思う」 means "I think he will come," not "I intend for him to come."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:思う (I think or thought)
  - term: つもりだ
    meaning: To plan to, to intend to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike Verb[volitional-form] + と思う, つもりだ expresses a firm intention or plan, often with a
      stronger sense of commitment or an announced, fixed plan. It implies a higher degree of certainty
      and pre-determination.
    grammar_point: つもりだ (intention or conviction)
  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]+とする
    meaning: Try to, Attempt to, To be about to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While Verb[volitional-form] + と思う indicates an internal decision, Verb[volitional-よう]+とする
      focuses on the act of attempting or being on the verge of doing something. It emphasizes the effort
      or imminence of the action.
    grammar_point: Verb[volitional]+とする (try about to)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between Verb[volitional-form] + と思う and similar expressions,
  consider the subtle differences in nuance. Use 「〜よう と 思う」 when you want to express a personal decision
  or intention that you have formed in your mind. If you want to emphasize the act of *trying* something,
  「てみる」 is more appropriate. For a direct statement of personal will or a casual invitation without the
  'thinking' nuance, the standalone volitional form (e.g., 行こう) is sufficient. If you are stating a firm,
  committed plan, 「つもりだ」 would be more fitting. Finally, if you are describing being on the verge of an
  action or making an effort, 「〜ようとする」 is the correct choice. Understanding these distinctions allows
  for more precise and natural Japanese communication.

    scene: Someone reflecting on an unexpected long conversation.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: The phrase 「思わなかった」 highlights a past expectation or prediction that turned out to be incorrect,
      suggesting a more nuanced reflection on an unplanned outcome. It emphasizes the speaker's surprise
      at the actual result compared to their initial thought.
post_example_writeup: The core of 「〜よう と 思う」 lies in expressing the speaker's personal intention or decision.
  When considering which verb form to use, pay attention to the level of politeness required by the context
  (plain forms for casual settings, ます-forms for polite) and whether the intention is a fresh decision
  (simple plain/polite forms) or an ongoing thought/plan (〜ている form). The conditional forms 「思えば」 and
  「思ったら」 are particularly useful for discussing hypothetical scenarios based on an intention or the outcome
  of a decision-making moment, respectively.
