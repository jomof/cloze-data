etymology: The etymology of 「どうも」 is complex, tracing back to older Japanese where 「どう」 meant "how" or

writeup: |-
  「どうも」 is a highly versatile Japanese adverb with multiple meanings and usages, often implying a sense of ambiguity, difficulty, or a general acknowledgment. Its precise meaning is heavily dependent on context and the surrounding words. It can be used to express:

  *   **Difficulty or inability:** When paired with a negative verb or adjective, 「どうも」 indicates that something is not going well, is difficult to achieve, or cannot be done easily, often implying a subtle, almost unexplainable, resistance. For example, 「{どうも}分からない」 implies "I just can't quite understand it, for some reason." or "I'm having trouble understanding it."
  *   **Conjecture or impression:** When followed by expressions like 「らしい」 or 「ようだ」, 「どうも」 suggests a strong impression, hunch, or conjecture based on indirect evidence. For example, 「{どうも}疲れているようだ」 means "It seems like they're tired, for some reason" or "I get the impression they're tired."
  *   **General acknowledgment/versatile expression:** Used alone, 「どうも」 can serve as a casual, condensed expression of gratitude, apology, or even a greeting. Its specific meaning in such cases is entirely derived from the immediate situation, tone of voice, and body language. For instance, a quick 「{どうも}」 can mean "Thanks," "Sorry," or "Hello" depending on the context. While versatile, it is often followed by a more specific phrase like 「ありがとう」 or 「すみません」 for clarity and politeness, especially in formal settings.
false_friends:
  - term: どうもありがとう
    meaning: Thank you very much
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どうもありがとう」 is a more direct and common expression of gratitude. 「どうも」 by itself is more versatile
      and can express other nuances like apology or acknowledgement.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どうもありがとう (thank you very much)
  - term: どうもすみません
    meaning: I'm very sorry
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どうもすみません」 is a more direct and common expression of apology. 「どうも」 by itself is more versatile
      and can express other nuances like greeting or acknowledgement.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どうもすみません (very sorry)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「どうも」 by itself is a very versatile expression, and it is useful to understand
  the context in which it is used in order to understand the nuanced meaning. When someone says just 「どうも」,
  it could be a shortened greeting, or a less specific expression of apology/gratitude. When combined
  with 「ありがとう」 or 「すみません」, the meaning is a more specific expression of thanks or apology.
examples:
  - english: This problem is somehow too complex to solve.
    japanese:
      - この 問題 は、{どう も} 複雑 すぎ て 解け ませ ん。
      - この 問題 は、{どう も} 複雑 すぎ て 解け ない。
      - この 問題 は {どう も} 難し すぎ て、手 が つけ られ ない。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 問題 は 複雑 すぎ て 解け ませ ん。
        english: This problem is too complex to solve.
        hint: The original sentence implies a deeper, possibly inexplicable, inability or difficulty.
          We're looking for a sentence that conveys that subtle sense of 'somehow'.
    scene: A student struggles with a difficult math problem, feeling frustrated by its unexpected complexity.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「どうも」 here emphasizes a sense of inexplicable difficulty or a subtle, almost unexplainable,
      resistance in solving the problem. It implies that there's an elusive quality to the complexity,
      making it hard to pinpoint why it's so challenging to solve. The phrase 「解け ませ ん」 highlights the
      inability to resolve it.
  - english: Thank you. That helped a lot.
    japanese:
      - '{どう も} 助かり まし た。ありがとう ござい ます。'
      - '{どう も}。本当 に 助かり まし た。'
      - '{どう も} 助かっ た よ。サンキュー。'

    scene: A colleague thanks another for timely assistance, feeling genuinely relieved.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: In this context, 「どうも」 acts as a succinct, general expression of gratitude, often replacing
      a longer phrase like 「どうもありがとうございます」 or simply adding emphasis. The continuation 「助かり まし た。ありがとう
      ござい ます。」 clarifies the specific meaning of thanks, indicating a genuine sense of relief and appreciation
      for assistance received.
  - english: I'm very sorry. I'm late.
    japanese:
      - '{どう も} すみ ませ ん。遅れ て しまい まし た。'

    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: Here, 「どうも」 intensifies the apology, conveying a deeper sense of regret or embarrassment.
      It implies that the lateness is not just a minor inconvenience but something the speaker feels genuinely
      bad about, possibly with an unstated reason. The phrase 「遅れ て しまい まし た」 adds to the sense of an
      unintentional or regrettable action.
  - english: It somehow seems he likes her.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は {どう も} 彼女 の こと が 好き らしい です。
      - 彼 は {どう も} 彼女 の こと が 好き らしい。
      - 彼 は {どう も} 彼女 の こと が 好き な よう です。

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The addition of 「どうも」 before 「好き らしい です」 suggests that the speaker's impression or conjecture
      about his feelings is based on subtle cues or a strong hunch, rather than direct evidence. It implies
      a degree of uncertainty or an unexplainable feeling about the observation, as if saying, "I can't
      quite put my finger on it, but..."
  - english: Lately, I just haven't been feeling well for some reason.
    japanese:
      - 最近、{どう も} 体 の 調子 が 良く ない ん です。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 最近、体 の 調子 が 良く ない ん です。
        english: Lately, I haven't been feeling well.
        hint: The original sentence highlights an unexplainable reason for feeling unwell, conveying a
          sense of vague discomfort. We're looking for a sentence that expresses this inexplicable aspect.

    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Using 「どうも」 here emphasizes that the speaker's ill feeling is persistent and unexplained,
      as if there's no clear reason for it. It conveys a sense of vague discomfort or a lingering issue
      that just won't go away, enhancing the melancholic tone.

    japanese:
      - あの 店 の ラーメン は {どう も} 私 の 口 に 合い ませ ん。

      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 店 の ラーメン は 私 の 口 に 合い ませ ん。
        english: The ramen at that shop just doesn't suit my taste.
        hint: The original sentence emphasizes an inexplicable personal aversion, suggesting it just 'doesn't
          click.' We're looking for a sentence that conveys this subtle, unexplainable dislike.
    scene: A diner reflects on a restaurant's popular dish that, despite its reputation, simply doesn't
      appeal to them personally.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「どうも 口 に 合い ませ ん」 with 「どうも」 conveys that the speaker's dislike for the ramen is
      a subjective and almost inexplicable feeling, even if others enjoy it. It's not a logical deduction
      but an intrinsic aversion, reinforcing the reflective tone.
  - english: Hi, you look great in that outfit today.
    japanese:
      - '{どう も}、今日 は 素敵 な 服 です ね。'
      - '{どう も}、今日 は お洒落 な 服 です ね。'
      - '{どう も}。素敵 です ね、その 服。'

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 素敵 な 服 です ね。
        english: You look great in that outfit today.
        hint: The original sentence starts with a casual, versatile greeting. We're looking for a sentence
          that includes this initial, non-specific acknowledgment.
    scene: A man casually compliments a woman on her attire.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The standalone 「どうも」 here functions as a casual, slightly flirtatious greeting. The concluding
      「ね」 adds a seeking of agreement, further enhancing the casual and inviting tone, as if to say, 'You
      agree, right?'
  - english: Somehow, I'm really drawn to the way you talk, you know.
    japanese:
      - '{どう も}、あなた の 話し 方 が 気 に なる ん です よ ね。'

      - '{どう も}、あなた の 話し 方 に 引か れる なぁ。'

          - あなた の 話し 方 が 気 に なる ん です よ ね。
        english: I'm really drawn to the way you talk, you know.
        hint: The original sentence conveys an inexplicable or subtle attraction, something the speaker
          might not fully understand. We're looking for a sentence that includes this sense of inexplicable
          allure.
    scene: A man on a first date expresses an inexplicable attraction to his companion's manner of speaking.
    register: casual
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The 「どうも」 here implies an inexplicable or subtle attraction. The combination with 「気になる」 (to
      be interested in/bothered by) suggests an attraction that the speaker might not fully understand
      but feels strongly. The sentence-final 「よ ね」 invites agreement from the listener, making the statement
      more engaging and less assertive, suitable for a first date.
  - english: Excuse me, is this your umbrella?

      - '{どう も}、この 傘 は あなた の です か？'

      - competing_japanese:

        english: Is this your umbrella?

          me.' We're looking for a sentence that includes this initial phrase to signal an interaction.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: In this context, 「どうも」 serves as a polite, non-specific opener to get someone's attention,
      similar to "Excuse me." It's a versatile way to initiate a conversation without committing to a
      specific greeting or apology initially, appropriate in a public setting.
  - english: I'm afraid, for some reason, I won't be able to be with you tonight.
    japanese:
      - '{どう も}、今夜 は 君 と 一緒 に い られ そう も ない ん だ。'
      - '{どう も}、今夜 は 君 と 一緒 に い られ そう に も あり ませ ん。'

    scene: A husband regretfully informs his wife that an unforeseen circumstance prevents him from coming
      home tonight.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The 「どうも」 here introduces a sense of reluctance or an inexplicable circumstance preventing
      the speaker from being with the listener. The use of 「君」 (kimi) and the casual 「ん だ」 indicates an
      intimate relationship, conveying a personal and somewhat regretful apology from a man to his partner.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, the versatile nature of 「どうも」 allows it to express
  a range of nuances from vague uncertainty to emphasized emotion, depending heavily on the accompanying
  phrases, context, and speaker's tone. Recognizing these patterns and the situations in which 「どうも」 is
  used will greatly enhance your understanding and natural use of this common Japanese expression.
