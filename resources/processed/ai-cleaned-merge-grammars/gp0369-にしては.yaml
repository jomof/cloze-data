    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にしては」 is derived from 「にする」 (to decide on/consider as) + the topic particle 「は」. Literally, it means something like \"if one makes it [A]...\", implying a comparison against a certain standard or expectation.",
    "writeup": "「にしては」 is used to express a surprising deviation from an expected standard or norm. It's similar to saying \"considering...\" or \"even for...\" in English, but it carries a nuance of unexpectedness. The (A) part of the sentence sets up a standard or expectation, and the (B) part presents something that doesn't quite align with that expectation. It can be used with both nouns and verbs in their plain form. It does not indicate that (B) is a result of (A).",
