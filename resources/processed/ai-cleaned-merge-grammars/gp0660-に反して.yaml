    "etymology": "「に反して」is derived from 「反する(hansuru)」, meaning \"to oppose\" or \"to go against\". The 「に」 particle indicates the target of the opposition. Therefore, 「に反して」literally means \"opposing to\" or \"going against\".",
    "writeup": "「に反して」 is used to express that something is contrary to expectations, rules, or someone's will. It is often used in formal contexts, such as academic writing, news reports, and business presentations. It indicates a contrast or opposition to what was previously stated or expected. It is similar to \"contrary to\" or \"against\" in English. While 「に対して」 can also mean \"in contrast to\", 「に反して」 often implies a violation or deviation from a standard or expectation.",
