    "etymology": "「に反して」is derived from 「反する(hansuru)」, meaning \"to oppose\" or \"to go against\". The 「に」 particle indicates the target of the opposition. Therefore, 「に反して」literally means \"opposing to\" or \"going against\" the noun it follows.",
    "writeup": "「に反して」 is used to express that something is contrary to expectations, rules, or someone's will. It is often used in formal contexts, such as academic writing, news reports, and business presentations. This grammar point indicates a contrast or opposition to what was previously stated or expected. It is similar to \"contrary to\" or \"against\" in English. While 「に対して」 can also mean \"in contrast to\", 「に反して」 often implies a violation or deviation from a standard or expectation, or a significant divergence from a prediction or desire. It can appear as 「に反して」 (te-form), 「に反する」 (dictionary form, typically modifying a noun), or 「に反した」 (past plain, modifying a noun).",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「逆に」, 「むしろ」, 「却って」, 「に対して」, and 「にひきかえ」 can sometimes be used in contexts of contrast, they have distinct nuances. 「逆に」 emphasizes a direct reversal, 「むしろ」 suggests a preference or alternative, and 「却って」 highlights an unexpected, often negative, ironic result. 「に対して」 is a general contrasting particle. 「にひきかえ」 specifically draws a strong comparison between two things. In contrast, 「に反して」 specifically emphasizes the idea of going against or being contrary to something else, often implying a violation of a rule or a significant divergence from an expectation or will.
