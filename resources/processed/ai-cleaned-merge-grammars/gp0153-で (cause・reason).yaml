meaning: Because of; due to; from (indicating cause)
pronunciation:
  katakana: デ
  romaji: de
formation:
  '[Noun] + で': Indicates the cause or reason for an action, state, or event originating from the noun.
  '[Na-adjective stem] + な + で': Indicates the cause or reason stemming from the na-adjective's state
    or quality. (Used when the na-adjective acts as a predicate before 'de' to explain a reason.)
jlpt: N5
etymology: The particle 「で」 originates from the conjunctive form (連用形 - ren'yōkei) of the verb 「ある」 (aru),
  meaning “to be” or “to exist.” Over time, this conjunctive form evolved into a particle that indicates
  location, means, and cause. In its causal sense, 「で」 implies that the preceding noun or state serves
  as the “location” or “condition” from which the subsequent action or state arises, thus acting as the
  cause for the subsequent event or state.
writeup: |-
  The particle 「で」 (de) serves multiple functions in Japanese, and one of its fundamental roles is to indicate the **cause or reason** for an action, event, or state. It is attached directly to nouns or noun phrases, signifying "because of," "due to," or "from" the preceding element. This usage is quite versatile and can apply to a wide range of situations, from simple daily occurrences to more significant events.

  Unlike other causal expressions that might carry specific nuances (e.g., strong personal feeling or formal tone), 「で」 for cause is generally neutral and objective. It presents the reason as a direct factor leading to the outcome, without necessarily implying blame, surprise, or personal emotion. It's often used when the cause is readily apparent or a straightforward explanation.

  For example, if you say 「病気で学校を休みました」 (Byōki de gakkō o yasumimashita), it clearly states "I was absent from school **because of** illness." The illness is the direct and objective cause. Similarly, 「雨で中止になった」 (Ame de chūshi ni natta) means "It was canceled **due to** rain."

  It's important to distinguish this causal 「で」 from other uses of 「で」, such as indicating a location where an action takes place (e.g., 「公園で遊ぶ」 - play in the park) or the means by which an action is performed (e.g., 「電車で会社に行く」 - go to work by train). While they share the same phonetic form, their grammatical functions and meanings differ significantly. The context usually makes the meaning clear.

  - term: から (reason・cause)
    meaning: because, so, since, the reason being
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「で」 often indicates a more direct, objective, and factual cause, frequently used with nouns
      that *are* the cause (e.g., illness, accident, rain). 「から」 is more versatile and can connect clauses,
      providing a reason that might be more subjective, a speaker's inference, or a wider context for
      the following statement. 「から」 can also attach to verbs and adjectives, which 「で」 cannot directly
      do in this causal sense.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]から (because・so)'
  - term: ので (reason)
    meaning: Because, so, since, the reason being
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「で」 is often used for a simple, direct cause (e.g., noun + で). 「ので」, while also indicating
      cause/reason, is generally perceived as softer and more polite than 「から」, and is commonly used when
      providing explanations or excuses where the speaker wants to avoid sounding abrupt. It often implies
      a natural or logical consequence.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]から (because・so)'
  - term: によって・による・により (means・cause・dependency)
    meaning: By means of, according to, depending on, because of, due to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「によって」 can also express cause ("due to"), it often implies a more formal or impersonal
      cause, an agent, or a method. 「で」 is more common for common, everyday causes.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]によって (means・method)'
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「で」, 「から」, and 「ので」 to express cause, consider the nature
  of the cause and the desired tone. Use 「で」 for clear, factual causes, especially when the cause is a
  noun. Use 「から」 when the reason is more subjective, an inference, or to provide a broader context, and
  it can attach to full clauses. Opt for 「ので」 when you want a softer, more polite explanation that implies
  a natural consequence. 「によって」 is generally more formal and suggests an agent or a method, often used
  in written or official contexts when indicating cause.

  - english: I was late for school because of the traffic jam.
    japanese:
      - 渋滞 {で} 学校 に 遅れ まし た。
      - 渋滞 {で} 学校 に 遅れ た。

          - 渋滞 が あっ た の で 学校 に 遅れ まし た。
        english: Because there was a traffic jam, I was late for school.
        hint: 「ので」 connects a reason expressed by a full clause, offering a slightly softer tone. We're
          looking for a direct noun cause without a preceding clause.

      for the recovery. This construction is common for describing qualities or conditions that act as
      a cause.

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「で」 for cause connects a preceding noun or noun phrase
  directly to the result. It's particularly useful when the cause is a concrete thing or situation, allowing
  for concise and direct expressions. Pay attention to the distinction between this causal 「で」 and 「で」
  indicating location or means, as context is key to understanding its function.
