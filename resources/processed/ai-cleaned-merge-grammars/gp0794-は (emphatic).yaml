    "etymology": "The particle 「は」 originally indicated a topic, but in this usage, it has evolved to add emphasis or contrast to the preceding word or phrase. It shares its origins with the topic marker 「は」, but its function is distinct, emphasizing the state or action itself, often implying a 'but' or 'though' in the background. This particular emphatic use developed from the topic-marking function by narrowing its scope to highlight a specific predicate or element, setting it apart.",
    "writeup": "The 「は」 particle, when used for emphasis, highlights a statement, often with a sense of contrast or unexpectedness. It's not just stating a fact; it's drawing attention to it, often implying, \"Yes, this is true, **but**...\". It can be attached to various parts of speech, including verb stems, adjectives, and nouns. Think of it as adding a bit of dramatic flair or highlighting a nuance in your sentence. It is a great way to add emphasis to your speech, especially when you are contradicting or trying to persuade someone. It is often used by both men and women across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal speech.",
