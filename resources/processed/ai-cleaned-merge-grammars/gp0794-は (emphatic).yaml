    "etymology": "The particle 「は」 originally functioned as a topic marker, but in this emphatic usage, it retains some of that function by highlighting the specific element it follows. It essentially \"picks out\" that element for special attention, often to set up a contrast or qualification. The addition of 「は」 here is not simply grammatical; it adds semantic weight, turning a plain statement into one with implied comparison or reservation.",
    "writeup": "The 「は」 particle, when used emphatically, adds a layer of nuance to a sentence. It affirms or negates the element it follows, but often implies a contrast, concession, or something unexpected. Think of it as saying, \"Yes, this is true, BUT...\" or \"Even though this is the case...\".\n\nIt can be attached to the ます-stem of a verb, the te-form of a verb, the stem of an i-adjective (after removing the い and adding く), or after では for na-adjectives and nouns. This usage highlights that particular element in the sentence.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The emphatic 「は」 is often used to express a sense of reservation or to introduce a contrasting idea.\n*   It can convey a feeling that something is not quite as expected or that there's more to the story.",
