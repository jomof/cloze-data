        "あわよくば + [desirable outcome]": "Indicates a desired outcome that relies on luck or favorable circumstances."

    "jlpt": "N0",
    "meaning": "If luck is on my side, if possible, all going well",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Typically used in casual conversation, but can be used in some formal situations depending on the context."
    },
    "etymology": "「あわよくば」is derived from the old-fashioned い-Adjective 「あわよい」 meaning 'convenient' or 'timely', combined with the conjunction particle 「ば」 'if'. The 「ば」 attaches to the 「く」 form of the い-Adjective 「あわよい」 rather than 「けれ」, as would usually be required with modern conjugation rules. This is due to the conjugation rules for 「ば」 in relation to い-Adjectives being different in both classical and modern Japanese.",
    "writeup": "「あわよくば」 combines the archaic い-adjective 「あわよい」 ('convenient', 'timely') with the conditional particle 「ば」 ('if'). It translates to 'if the time is right', 'if possible', or 'if luck is on my side'. Despite its origins, 「あわよくば」 functions as a single adverb in modern Japanese, preceding a phrase that expresses a desirable outcome.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「あわよくば」 implies that the desired outcome is somewhat unlikely or dependent on favorable circumstances.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes the speculative and slightly unlikely nature of a lottery win, which is precisely what 「あわよくば」 conveys, unlike the more general 'if you're lucky' implied by 「運が良ければ」."

                    "mitigation": "The context of hoping to be *chosen* for a leader role highlights the element of desire and favorable circumstances, which 「あわよくば」 perfectly encapsulates, more so than the neutral 'if possible' of 「もし可能なら」."
