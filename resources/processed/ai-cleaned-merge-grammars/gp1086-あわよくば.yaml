    },
    "etymology": "「あわよくば」 is derived from the archaic い-adjective 「あわよい」 (awayoi), meaning 'convenient' or 'timely', combined with the conditional particle 「ば」 (ba), indicating 'if'.  The archaic usage of 「あわよい」 implies a sense of opportune timing, and 「ば」 establishes a conditional relationship, leading to the combined meaning of 'if the timing is right' or 'if circumstances are favorable'.",
    "writeup": "「あわよくば」 is a combination of the old-fashioned い-Adjective 「あわよい」 meaning 'convenient' or 'timely', and the conjunction particle 「ば」 meaning 'if'. It can be translated as 'if the time is right', 'if possible', or 'if luck is on my side'. Despite its roots, 「あわよくば」 is treated as a single word in modern Japanese and is used as a typical adverb. 「あわよくば」 comes before a phrase expressing a desirable outcome.\n\n**Important Note:** 「ば」 attaches to the 「く」 form of the い-Adjective 「あわよい」 rather than 「けれ」, as would usually be required with modern conjugation rules. This is due to the conjugation rules for 「ば」 in relation to い-Adjectives being different in both classical and modern Japanese.",
