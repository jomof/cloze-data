    "etymology": "「あわよくば」is derived from the old-fashioned い-Adjective 「あわよい」 meaning 'convenient' or 'timely', combined with the conjunction particle 「ば」 'if'. The 「ば」 attaches to the 「く」 form of the い-Adjective 「あわよい」 rather than 「けれ」, as would usually be required with modern conjugation rules. This is due to the conjugation rules for 「ば」 in relation to い-Adjectives being different in both classical and modern Japanese.",
    "writeup": "「あわよくば」 combines the archaic い-adjective 「あわよい」 ('convenient', 'timely') with the conditional particle 「ば」 ('if'). It translates to 'if the time is right', 'if possible', or 'if luck is on my side'. Despite its origins, 「あわよくば」 functions as a single adverb in modern Japanese, preceding a phrase that expresses a desirable outcome.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「あわよくば」 implies that the desired outcome is somewhat unlikely or dependent on favorable circumstances.",
