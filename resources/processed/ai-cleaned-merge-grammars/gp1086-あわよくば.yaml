        "あわよくば + [desirable outcome]": "Indicates a desired outcome that relies on luck or favorable circumstances."

        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Can be used in both casual and semi-formal contexts, depending on the desired nuance of uncertainty or hopefulness.",
        "function": "Expresses a strong desire or hope for a favorable outcome, often implying a degree of uncertainty or reliance on luck.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the desired outcome is somewhat unlikely or dependent on favorable circumstances, conveying a sense of hopeful ambition or wishful thinking."
    },
    "etymology": "「あわよくば」 is derived from the old-fashioned い-Adjective 「あわよい」 meaning 'convenient' or 'timely', combined with the conjunction particle 「ば」 'if'. The 「ば」 attaches to the 「く」 form of the い-Adjective 「あわよい」 rather than 「けれ」, as would usually be required with modern conjugation rules. This reflects historical linguistic patterns where the conditional 「ば」 attached directly to the adverbial form of い-adjectives.",
    "writeup": "「あわよくば」 functions as a single adverb in modern Japanese, preceding a phrase that expresses a desirable outcome. It conveys a strong sense of hopeful ambition or wishful thinking, indicating that the desired outcome relies on favorable circumstances or a stroke of luck.\n\nWhile grammatically rooted in older Japanese, it is now used as a fixed expression. Its usage implies that the speaker is aware that the desired situation is not guaranteed and requires some element of good fortune or opportune timing. It is a common expression in both spoken and written Japanese.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes the speculative and slightly unlikely nature of a lottery win, which is precisely what 「あわよくば」 conveys, unlike the more general 'if you're lucky' implied by 「運が良ければ」."

                    "mitigation": "The context of hoping to be *chosen* for a leader role highlights the element of desire and favorable circumstances, which 「あわよくば」 perfectly encapsulates, more so than the neutral 'if possible' of 「もし可能なら」."
