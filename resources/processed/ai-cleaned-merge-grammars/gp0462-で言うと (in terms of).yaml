etymology: 「で言うと」 is composed of 「で」 (the particle indicating means, method, or context) and 「言うと」 (the

  to say with/by means of'.
writeup: |-
  「で言うと」 is a versatile expression used to frame a statement within a specific context or perspective. It functions much like saying "in terms of X," "speaking of X," or "if we were to put it in X's terms."

  This grammar point is particularly useful when you want to:
  *   **Draw comparisons or analogies**: By stating something in terms of another known entity or concept.
  *   **Provide explanations**: By clarifying how something is understood or classified within a particular domain or system.
  *   **Specify a frame of reference**: Indicating the category or viewpoint from which information is being presented.

  It often appears in conjunction with 「～に当たる」 (にあたる), which means "corresponds to" or "is equivalent to," further emphasizing the comparative or explanatory nature of the statement.

  A common set phrase using this grammar is 「一言で言うと」 (ひとこと で いうと), meaning "in a word" or "to put it simply." This specific usage is employed when concisely summarizing complex information into a brief statement.

examples:
  - english: When speaking in English terms, Gochisousamadeshita conveys a subtly different sense of gratitude
      compared to Thank you for the meal.
    japanese:
      - 『ご ちそう さま でし た』は 英語 {で 言う と}『Thank you for the meal』と は 少し 違う 感謝 の 気持ち です。
      - 『ご ちそう さま でし た』は 英語 {で 言え ば}『Thank you for the meal』と は 少し 違う 感謝 の 気持ち です。
    english_literally: Gochisousamadeshita is with English speaking, 'Thank you for the meal' and is slightly
      different feeling of gratitude.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 『ご ちそう さま でし た』は 英語 {で は}『Thank you for the meal』です。
        english: Gochisousamadeshita is Thank you for the meal in English.
        hint: Using 「英語では」 would imply a simple direct translation or equivalence. However, the teacher
          wants to convey that while 'Thank you for the meal' is a functional translation, the nuance
          of 'Gochisousamadeshita' is more complex and goes beyond mere verbal thanks, encompassing gratitude
          for the food, the effort, and the people involved. 「で言うと」 helps frame this discussion within
          the context of 'speaking in terms of English' while preserving the deeper meaning. We're looking
          for phrasing that means 'in terms of'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 『ご ちそう さま でし た』は 英語 {から 言う と}『Thank you for the meal』と は 少し 違う 感謝 の 気持ち です。
        english: From an English perspective, Gochisousamadeshita conveys a subtly different sense of
          gratitude compared to Thank you for the meal.
        hint: 「から言うと」 emphasizes the *source* or *point of view* from which the statement is made, whereas
          「で言うと」 frames the statement *within the context* or *terms of* something. We're looking for
          phrasing that means 'in terms of'.

    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The speaker, an older female teacher, uses 「で言うと」 to carefully explain a cultural nuance,
      indicating that while a simple translation exists, the true sentiment (気持ち) is more profound. This
      phrasing sets up a more detailed explanation rather than just a direct equivalence.

        english: The new department, on the company's organizational chart, is directly below the sales
          department.
        hint: Using 「会社の組織図では」 (on the company's organizational chart) would simply state a fact about
          the chart. However, 「で言うと」 implies using the organizational chart as the specific *frame of
          reference* or *system* through which the location is being understood and explained, which is
          more appropriate when detailing a hierarchical structure to an audience. We're looking for phrasing
          that means 'in terms of'.

          below the sales department.
        hint: 「から言うと」 emphasizes the *source* or *point of view* from which the statement is made, while

        english: His passion for work is like a blue flame that will never extinguish.
        hint: While 「炎のように」 (like a flame) creates a simile, 「で言うと」 frames the comparison by establishing
          'flame' as the *conceptual category* or *analogy* through which the passion is being understood
          and expressed. It's not just that the passion is *like* a flame, but that the speaker is *using*
          the concept of a flame to articulate it, making the explanation more deliberate. We're looking
          for phrasing that means 'in terms of'.

        english: From the perspective of a flame, his passion for work is a blue flame that will never
          extinguish.
        hint: 「から言うと」 emphasizes the *viewpoint* of the flame itself, which doesn't make sense here. 「で言うと」
          introduces the flame as the *analogy* or *category* for description. We're looking for phrasing
          that means 'in terms of'.

        english: To put it simply, we need more effort to achieve our goals.
        hint: 「簡単に言うと」 means 'to put it simply' or 'in brief,' but it doesn't carry the specific nuance
          of boiling down information to a single, powerful word or phrase. 「一言で言うと」 specifically emphasizes
          summarizing the essence as concisely as possible, often into one key point, which is more effective
          for a direct and impactful message in this context. We're looking for phrasing that means 'in
          a word'.

        hint: While 「医学的には」 (medically speaking/from a medical standpoint) conveys a similar meaning,
          「医学で言うと」 emphasizes the *domain* of medicine as the specific framework or context through which
          the classification is made. This phrasing can sound more conversational and empathetic, framing
          the explanation directly for the listener rather than as a purely technical statement. We're

          the world map as the *specific scale or reference point* for understanding the town's relative
          size. It emphasizes that the comparison is being made through the lens of that particular representation,

  other particles like 「では」 which might simply state a fact about a given context. It prompts the listener
  to consider the statement from a specific viewpoint.
