    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「と言う」 (to say), 「こと」 (thing, matter), and 「だ」 (to be). Thus, it literally translates to 'it is the case that [something was said]'.",
    "writeup": "「ということだ」 is used to convey information the speaker has heard from another source, or to explain the meaning of something. It's similar to \"I heard that...\" or \"it means that...\". It's more formal than 「そうだ」 when reporting information, as it implies a higher degree of certainty. 「ということだ」 is often used with other expressions indicating the source of information, such as 「によると」 or 「によれば」. When expressing hearsay, it can sometimes be rephrased as 「とのことだ」, which places more emphasis on the source of the information.",
