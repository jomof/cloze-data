meaning: in addition, moreover, furthermore
pronunciation:
  katakana: ソレニ
  romaji: sore ni
formation:
  Sentence A + {それに} + Sentence B: Used to add a new piece of information or reason to the previous statement.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The expression "それに" combines the demonstrative pronoun "それ" (that) and the particle "に" (to,
  at). Literally, it can be understood as "to that" or "on top of that." Over time, this evolved to signify
  the addition of further information or reasons, building upon what has just been stated. It carries
  the sense of adding something *to* the existing point or context, much like placing one item next to
  another.
writeup: 「それに」 is a conjunctive expression used to add supplementary information or another reason to
  a preceding statement. It functions like "in addition," "moreover," or "furthermore" in English. It
  primarily connects sentences or clauses, building upon the point made previously. While it is generally
  neutral in tone, it implies a logical continuation or accumulation of points. It can be used in both
  casual and formal contexts, though its formality level is somewhere in the middle, making it quite versatile.
  It is less emphatic than expressions like 「おまけに」 or 「しかも」, which often carry stronger positive or negative
  connotations.
false_friends:
  - term: また
    meaning: again, also
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「それに」 primarily adds another piece of information or reason to what was just stated, building
      on it. 「また」 can simply add another item to a list or indicate repetition, without necessarily implying
      a strong logical connection or accumulation of reasons.
    grammar_point: また (again; also; or)
  - term: しかも
    meaning: moreover, furthermore (with emphasis, often unexpected)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「それに」 adds information neutrally. 「しかも」 often suggests that the added information is even
      more significant, surprising, or unfavorable than what was previously stated. It carries a stronger
      emotional or emphatic tone.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:しかも (in addition・moreover)
  - term: おまけに
    meaning: what's more, to make matters worse (often negative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「それに」 is a neutral addition. 「おまけに」 is a more colloquial expression, often used when adding
      something undesirable or negative, implying "to top it off" or "as if that weren't enough." While
      it can be positive, its negative usage is more prominent.
    grammar_point: おまけに (in addition・on top of that)
  - term: その上
    meaning: in addition, furthermore (often cumulative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「それに」 adds general information. 「その上」 implies an addition that builds upon the previous point,
      often suggesting a cumulative effect or an intensification of the situation, whether positive or
      negative. It is slightly more formal than 「それに」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:その上 (in addition・moreover)
  - term: 加えて
    meaning: in addition to, furthermore (formal, explicit addition)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「それに」 is a common conjunctive expression. 「加えて」 is more formal and typically used when explicitly
      adding distinct information or facts, especially in written contexts or formal presentations. It
      suggests a more deliberate act of appending information.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:加えて (to add)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「それに」 serves as a straightforward way to add a piece of information or reason,
  building logically on a preceding statement. When considering similar expressions, it's important to
  note their specific nuances. 「また」 can be a simple additive ("also," "again") without necessarily implying
  a strong logical connection. 「しかも」 is used for emphasis, suggesting the added information is particularly
  significant or surprising. 「おまけに」 is more colloquial and often implies an undesirable additional factor.
  「その上」 often suggests a cumulative effect, intensifying the situation, while 「加えて」 is a more formal term
  used for explicitly appending new facts.
examples:
  - english: This restaurant is delicious. In addition, the prices are reasonable.
    japanese:
      - この レストラン は おいしい です。{それ に}、値段 も 手頃 です。
      - この レストラン は おいしい。{それ に}、値段 も 手頃 だ。
    english_literally: This restaurant is delicious. In addition, prices also reasonable.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この レストラン は おいしい です。そして、値段 も 手頃 です。
        english: This restaurant is delicious. And, the prices are reasonable.
        hint: 「そして」 simply connects two sentences or items, often implying a sequence or simple listing,
          rather than emphasizing an additional reason or piece of information like 「それに」. We're looking
          for an additional reason.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この レストラン は おいしい です。しかも、値段 も 手頃 です。
        english: This restaurant is delicious. What's more, the prices are reasonable.
        hint: 「しかも」 carries a stronger nuance of surprise or unexpectedness for the additional information,
          or implies it's even better/worse. We're looking for a more neutral addition.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 頭 が いい です。また、とても 真面目 です。
        english: He's smart. Also, he's very diligent.
        hint: 「また」 is a simple additive, often used for listing additional items or points without necessarily
          emphasizing the 'moreover' aspect. We're looking for an expression that adds emphasis to the
          second point as a further characteristic.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 頭 が いい です。その 上、とても 真面目 です。
        english: He's smart. On top of that, he's very diligent.
        hint: 「その上」 often implies a cumulative effect, adding something further or even better. While
          similar, 「それに」 is slightly more general for simply adding another point. We're looking for a
          direct 'moreover' connection.

  - english: I was tired from work. On top of that, I caught a cold.
    japanese:
      - 仕事 で 疲れ て い まし た。{それ に}、風邪 を 引い て しまい まし た。
      - 仕事 で 疲れ て い た。{それ に}、風邪 を 引い て しまっ た。
    english_literally: At work, I was tired. In addition, a cold I caught.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 仕事 で 疲れ て い まし た。おまけ に、風邪 を 引い て しまい まし た。
        english: I was tired from work. To make matters worse, I caught a cold.
        hint: 「おまけに」 often implies a negative addition, like 'to make matters worse' or 'to top it off.'
          While it fits this context, 「それに」 is a more neutral way to simply add another negative event.
          We're looking for a neutral addition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 仕事 で 疲れ て い まし た。その 結果、風邪 を 引い て しまい まし た。
        english: I was tired from work. As a result, I caught a cold.
        hint: 「その結果」 indicates a cause-and-effect relationship, implying the cold was a *result* of being
          tired. 「それに」 simply adds another fact without necessarily implying direct causality. We're looking
          for an additional, separate event.
    scene: Someone explaining why they missed an event.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
  - english: The road was narrow, and in addition, it was very dark.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 道 が 狭かっ た です。そして、とても 暗かっ た です。
        english: The road was narrow, and it was very dark.
        hint: 「そして」 simply connects two facts or events sequentially. 「それに」 emphasizes that the second
          fact is an *additional* characteristic or condition, often adding to the challenge or situation.
          We're looking for an additional characteristic.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 道 が 狭い し、とても 暗い し。
        english: The road is narrow, and it's very dark.
        hint: Using 「し～し」 lists reasons or conditions but tends to be more casual and can imply that there
          are other unstated reasons. 「それに」 explicitly connects two distinct statements. We're looking
          for an explicit conjunctive.

  - english: This proposal is innovative. Furthermore, it's financially viable.

        english: This proposal is innovative. In addition, it's financially viable.
        hint: 「加えて」 is a more formal and explicit way to add information, often used when presenting a
          list of distinct points. 「それに」 is slightly more conversational while still being suitable for
          formal contexts. We're looking for a slightly less formal connector.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 提案 は 革新 的 で ある。しかも、財政 的 に も 実現 可能 で ある。
        english: This proposal is innovative. Moreover, it's financially viable.
        hint: 「しかも」 often implies that the added point is particularly significant or even surprising,
          often for emphasis. 「それに」 offers a more straightforward addition without strong emotional emphasis.
          We're looking for a neutral addition.

  - english: That store's clothes are stylish. And what's more, they are comfortable.
    japanese:
      - あの 店 の 服 は おしゃれ だ ね。{それ に}、着心地 も いい し。
      - あの 店 の 服 は おしゃれ です。{それ に}、着心地 も いい です。
    english_literally: That store's clothes are stylish, right? In addition, wearing comfort also good.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 店 の 服 は おしゃれ な だけ で なく、着心地 も いい し。
        english: That store's clothes are not only stylish, but also comfortable.
        hint: Using 「だけでなく」 changes the sentence structure to 'not only A, but also B,' making it a single
          complex sentence. 「それに」 connects two separate sentences or clauses. We're looking for a connection
          between two distinct points.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 店 の 服 は おしゃれ だ ね。そして、着心地 も いい よ。
        english: That store's clothes are stylish, right? And, they are comfortable.
        hint: 「そして」 is a simpler conjunction that links ideas without the strong 'in addition' nuance
          of 「それに」. It focuses more on sequence or simple listing. We're looking for an explicit addition.
    scene: Two female friends shopping.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The casual sentence-ending particle 「ね」 and the use of 「し」 indicate a friendly, conversational
      tone between the two female friends. The phrase 「着心地 も いい し」, with the explanatory 「し」, naturally
      leads into the additional positive point.
  - english: The exam was difficult. Moreover, I didn't have enough time.
    japanese:
      - 試験 は 難しかっ た。{それ に}、時間 も 足り なかっ た。
      - 試験 は 難しかっ た です。{それ に}、時間 も 足り ませ ん でし た。
    english_literally: Exam was difficult. Moreover, time also was not enough.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 は 難しかっ た。しかも、時間 も 足り なかっ た。
        english: The exam was difficult. What's more, I didn't have enough time.
        hint: 「しかも」 often implies a stronger, perhaps surprising or aggravating, additional point. 「それに」
          is a more neutral way to add another piece of information to the statement. We're looking for
          a more neutral addition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 は 難しかっ た から、時間 も 足り なかっ た。
        english: Because the exam was difficult, I didn't have enough time.
        hint: Using 「から」 indicates a reason or cause-and-effect relationship, implying that the lack of
          time was *due to* the exam's difficulty. 「それに」 introduces an additional, separate problem. We're
          looking for a distinct additional point.

  - english: The company offers good benefits. In addition, the work environment is excellent.

      wonderful.
    competing_grammar:

          - この 会社 は 福利 厚生 が 良い です。また、職場 環境 も 素晴らしい です。
        english: This company offers good benefits. Also, the work environment is excellent.
        hint: 「また」 is a simple additive, often used for listing additional items or points. 「それに」 specifically
          emphasizes that the second point is an *additional* positive reason or feature. We're looking
          for an emphasized addition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 会社 は 福利 厚生 が 良い し、職場 環境 も 素晴らしい です。
        english: This company offers good benefits, and the work environment is excellent.
        hint: Using 「し」 to connect clauses lists reasons or qualities and is generally more informal,
          sometimes implying other unstated points. 「それに」 is a more direct and formal conjunctive to add
          information. We're looking for a more direct connection.

        english: We need to hurry. Therefore, it's starting to rain.
        hint: 「だから」 indicates a direct cause-and-effect relationship (because it's raining, we need to
          hurry). 「それに」 introduces an additional reason, not necessarily the *cause* of the previous statement.
          We're looking for an additional reason.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 急ぐ 必要 が あり ます。それ から、雨 も 降り 始め て い ます。
        english: We need to hurry. And then, it's starting to rain.
        hint: 「それから」 primarily indicates a sequence of events ('and then'). 「それに」 emphasizes an *additional*
          factor that contributes to the situation. We're looking for an additional contributing factor.
    scene: Two people preparing to leave.

  - english: This car is expensive. And also, its fuel efficiency is not good.
    japanese:
      - この 車 は 値段 が 高い です。{それ に}、燃費 も 良く ない です。
      - この 車 は 値段 が 高い。{それ に}、燃費 も 良く ない。
    english_literally: This car price is high. In addition, fuel efficiency also not good.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 車 は 値段 が 高い だけ で なく、燃費 も 良く ない です。
        english: This car is not only expensive, but its fuel efficiency is also not good.
        hint: Using 「だけでなく」 creates a single compound sentence where the two points are presented as cumulative
          features. 「それに」 connects two separate statements, emphasizing the addition. We're looking for
          a connection between two distinct points.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 車 は 値段 が 高い です。一方 で、燃費 も 良く ない です。
        english: This car is expensive. On the other hand, its fuel efficiency is not good.
        hint: 「一方で」 introduces a contrasting or different aspect. Here, both points are negative qualities
          of the car, so it's not a contrast. 「それに」 simply adds another point. We're looking for an additive,
          not a contrasting, connection.
    scene: A person discussing buying a car.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「それに」 seamlessly integrates additional information,
  whether it pertains to positive qualities, negative aspects, or general facts. Its neutral tone allows
  for broad applicability across various contexts and registers, making it a highly useful conjunctive
  expression in Japanese.
