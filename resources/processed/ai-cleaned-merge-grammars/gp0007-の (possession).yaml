    "etymology": "The particle 「の」 is believed to have originated from the verb 「在る (aru)」, meaning \"to be\" or \"to exist.\" Over time, it evolved into a particle indicating attribution, possession, or connection between two nouns. It essentially marks that the noun preceding 「の」 is associated with or possesses the noun following it.",
    "writeup": "From an English perspective, 「の」 has several meanings. It can indicate possession, similar to adding \"'s\" to a word. However, in Japanese, its meaning is broader, showing that B is an attribute or possession of A. For example, \"私のペン\" (watashi no pen) means \"my pen.\" 「の」 also shows a relationship between A and B, not just ownership.  For instance, 「先生の傘」 (sensei no kasa) means \"the teacher's umbrella.\" Although some examples use adjectives, we will cover those in more detail later.\n\n「の」 is generally used after nouns but can follow other word types, transforming them into noun-like phrases, known as nominalization. We will explore this in the 「の」 - Nominalization grammar point.",
