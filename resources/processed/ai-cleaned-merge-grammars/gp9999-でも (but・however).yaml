formation:
  '[Sentence A] + でも + [Sentence B]': Connects two clauses, where B expresses a contrast or opposition
    to A.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The origin of でも is believed to be a combination of the conjunctive particle で (de), indicating
  means or state, and the particle も (mo), indicating inclusion or emphasis ("even"). Over time, this
  combination evolved to express a sense of "even if/though" something is the case, leading to its conjunctive
  use as "but" or "however," by implying "even so."
writeup: |-
  でも is a versatile Japanese word used primarily as a conjunction to mean "but" or "however," introducing a contrasting or qualifying statement. It is broadly applicable across various contexts, from casual conversation to more formal writing, though it leans slightly more towards conversational use compared to しかし (shikashi).

  When connecting two clauses, でも signifies that the second clause presents information that contrasts with, qualifies, or sets a condition for the first clause. It can be used to introduce an exception, a change in topic, or a mild contradiction.

  Beyond its conjunctive role, でも also functions as a particle meaning "even" or "any (e.g., anything, anywhere, anyone)," especially when combined with interrogative words (e.g., 誰でも 'anyone', どこでも 'anywhere'). However, this grammar point focuses specifically on its use as a conjunction for "but/however."

  でも can also be used as an interjection to indicate an interjection or to soften a refusal, such as when offering a counter-suggestion. Its flexibility makes it a foundational element in everyday Japanese conversation.

      contradicts the expected outcome. "でも" simply states a contrast without this emotional nuance.'

    meaning: too; also; even
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: When "でも" means "even" (e.g., "何でも" - anything), it is often confused with "も" as a particle
      for "too" or "even." However, "でも" in this context always implies an exhaustive "any/every" choice,
      while "も" is simply additive.
    grammar_point: も (addition or emphasis particle)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  While "でも" serves as a straightforward "but" or "however," distinguishing it from similar expressions is key. "しかし," "けれど," and "だが" all convey contrast, with varying degrees of formality and nuance. "しかし" is the most formal, often used in writing or serious discourse. "けれど" is a gentle alternative, suitable for both speech and writing, and often implies a slight hesitation or softening. "だが" is direct and strong, frequently seen in more assertive male speech or written contexts.

  "のに" carries a sense of regret, surprise, or disapproval, suggesting that an outcome is contrary to expectation. Unlike "でも," which simply states a contrast, "のに" highlights an unfulfilled expectation or a mismatch between cause and effect. For instance, 「雨が降っているのに、傘がない。」(It's raining, yet I don't have an umbrella.) expresses a problem, while 「雨が降っている。でも、出かけよう。」(It's raining. But, let's go out.) is a simple contrasting statement.

  It is also important to note that "でも" can function differently when it follows an interrogative word (e.g., 誰でも - anyone, いつでも - anytime, 何でも - anything). In these cases, it means "even" or "any," implying inclusiveness or unrestricted choice, which is different from its conjunctive meaning of "but/however." The particle "も" also means "even" or "too," but typically signifies addition or emphasis on a single item, not an exhaustive set like "でも" with interrogatives.
