pronunciation:
  katakana: キル
  romaji: kiru
formation:
  '[Verb stem] + 切る': Indicates the action of the verb is done completely or to the limit. Often implies
    exhaustion of resources or resolute action affecting the verb's action itself, not a separate object.
    For example, 「疲れ切る」 means 'to be completely exhausted', and not 'to cut exhaustion'.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The verb 「切る(kiru)」 normally means "to cut." However, when attached to the stem of another
  verb, it takes on a meaning of doing something "completely" or "to the end." The nuance often implies
  that something has been used up or exhausted in the process.
writeup: The verb 「切る(kiru)」, which normally means "to cut," also functions as an auxiliary verb. When
  attached to the **masu-stem** of another verb, it indicates that the action of that verb is done **completely**
  or **to the limit**. This often carries a nuance of using up some kind of resource, such as energy or
  supplies. Therefore, it can be translated as "to do (A) to the point of being unable to continue," or
  "to totally and utterly do (A)." In some cases, it may suggest that (A) is being done with full effort
  or capacity, implying "to resolutely do (A)" or "to do (A) at full pelt."
false_friends:
  - term: 込む (thoroughly)
    meaning: To do thoroughly, deeply, intensely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「～込む」 can indicate thoroughness or intensity, it doesn't necessarily imply completion
      or exhaustion of resources like 「～きる」. It often suggests an inward or deep action.
    grammar_point: 込む (to do thoroughly)
  - term: てしまう・ちゃう (completion・regret・accident)
    meaning: To do something completely; to do something by accident; to do something regrettably/unfortunately
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～てしまう」 implies completion, but often with a sense of regret, finality, or unexpectedness,
      which 「～きる」 lacks. 「～きる」 focuses purely on the exhaustive nature of the action.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:てしまう・ちゃう (completion・regret・accident)
  - term: 上がる 上げる (to finish complete)
    meaning: Something is finished, To finish something, Something has come to an end, To do something
      completely, To do something through
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～上がる・上げる」 focuses on the state of being finished, or the completion of a task, without the
      specific connotation of using up resources or exerting maximum effort that 「～きる」 carries.
    grammar_point: 上がる 上げる (to finish complete)
  - term: 抜く (do completely)
    meaning: To do something completely, to the end, to see through, to overcome
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～抜く」 suggests going all the way or seeing something through a difficult process, implying
      perseverance. While it shares the meaning of completion, it doesn't necessarily imply the depletion
      of resources as often as 「～きる」.
    grammar_point: 抜く (do completely)
  - term: おわる (to finish)
    meaning: To finish, To end
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～おわる」 simply means to finish, often referring to the objective completion of an action. In
      contrast, 「～きる」 adds the nuance of completing something entirely, emphasizing the thoroughness,
      exhaustion, or resolute effort involved.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]おわる (to finish doing)'
post_false_friends_writeup: When using 「～きる」, remember to consider the nuance of completing something
  entirely, often implying that resources have been used up or that a resolute effort was made. Other
  expressions may simply indicate that something is finished without this additional implication, or carry
  nuances of regret, difficulty, or simple conclusion.
examples:
  - english: I completely finished reading this book in one day yesterday.
    japanese:
      - この 本 は 昨日 一 日 で 読み {切っ た}。
      - この 本 は 昨日 一 日 で 読み {切り まし た}。
      - この 本 は 昨日 一 日 で 読み {切っ た} よ。
      - この 本 は 昨日 一 日 で 読み {切っ た} ね。
      - この 本 を 昨日 一 日 で 読み {切っ た}。
    english_literally: This book, yesterday in one day, I read completely.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 昨日 一 日 で 読み {切れ なかっ た}。
        english: I couldn't finish reading this book in one day yesterday.
        hint: 「～きれない」 means you couldn't complete the action. We're looking for an example where the action
          was completed. This is the negative form of our current grammar point. It indicates that you
          didn't finish reading the book completely, as in, you could not read it to its end. Our grammar
          point means that you *did* read it to its end.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 昨日 一 日 で {読み込ん だ}。
        english: I read into this book deeply in one day yesterday.
        hint: 「読み込んだ」 means you read it thoroughly or deeply. We're looking for completely finishing the
          act of reading. 「読み込む」 implies a deeper study of the content, not necessarily finishing the
          entire book. Here we are emphasizing finishing the entire thing without missing a single page.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 昨日 一 日 で {読ん で しまっ た}。
        english: I ended up reading this book in one day yesterday.
        hint: 「読んでしまった」 suggests simply finishing, possibly with a nuance of regret or unexpectedness.
          We're looking for the nuance of completing it entirely without leaving anything. 「～てしまう」 can
          imply completion, but also a sense of regret or that something was done quickly without much
          thought. 「読み切る」 emphasizes that every page was read.
    scene: A student proudly telling a friend about finishing a book.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The speaker uses casual language appropriate for talking to a friend. The use of 「一日で」 emphasizes
      the speed and completeness of the action. The use of 「読み切った」 highlights that the book was read cover-to-cover,
      leaving no part unread, and implies a thorough completion.
  - english: I ate up all the cake.
    japanese:
      - ケーキ を 食べ {切っ た}。
      - ケーキ を 食べ {切り まし た}。
    english_literally: Cake, ate completely.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ケーキ を {全部 食べ た}。
        english: I ate all the cake.
        hint: 「全部食べた」 simply states that all of it was eaten. While similar, 「食べ切った」 specifically emphasizes
          consuming *to the very end* or *completely finishing* what was available, leaving nothing. We're
          looking for an example that stresses the thoroughness of the consumption.
    scene: A child proudly showing an empty plate after finishing a large piece of cake.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「食べ切った」 indicates a sense of thorough completion, often with a feeling of satisfaction
      or having achieved a goal of eating everything. It implies nothing was left, emphasizing the exhaustive
      nature of the action rather than just stating that it's all gone.
  - english: My smartphone battery is completely dead.
    japanese:
      - スマート フォン の バッテリー が 切れ {ちゃっ た}。
      - スマート フォン の バッテリー が 切れ {て しまっ た}。
    english_literally: Smartphone's battery has completely run out.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - スマート フォン の バッテリー が {なく なっ た}。
        english: My smartphone battery ran out.
        hint: 「なくなった」 simply means it's gone or has disappeared. 「切れちゃった」 implies a complete exhaustion
          or depletion, often with a nuance of regret or slight exasperation. We're looking for an expression
          that conveys total depletion of a resource.
    scene: Someone complaining to a friend that their phone died unexpectedly.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The auxiliary verb 「切る」 in 「切れちゃった」 (colloquial for 切れてしまった) indicates that the battery has
      been used to its absolute limit, resulting in complete exhaustion. The 「～ちゃった」 adds a casual, slightly
      regretful or exasperated tone, conveying that the speaker is bothered by the complete depletion.
  - english: All the concert tickets sold out immediately.
    japanese:
      - コンサート の チケット は すぐ 売り {切れ た}。

      - competing_japanese:
          - コンサート の チケット は すぐ {完売 し た}。
        english: All the concert tickets were immediately sold out.
        hint: 「完売した」 (かんばいした) is a formal term for 'sold out'. While accurate, 「売り切れた」 specifically emphasizes
          the process of *selling* until nothing is left, often conveying the sense that they were all
          thoroughly sold. We're looking for a verb phrase that highlights this thorough selling process.
    scene: A news anchor reporting on the high demand for a popular concert.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「売り切れた」 uses the intransitive form of 「売り切る」, emphasizing that the tickets were sold until
      the supply was completely exhausted. This suggests a thorough and complete selling process, often
      used when an item is in high demand and sells out entirely.
  - english: After running a full marathon, I was completely exhausted.

    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「疲れ切った」 emphasizes that the exhaustion is complete and total, to the point of having no energy
      or strength remaining. It conveys a profound physical or mental state of depletion, far beyond just
      being 'very tired'.
  - english: He ran at full speed, giving it his all.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 全力 を 出し {切っ て} 走っ た。
      - 彼 は 全力 を 出し {切っ て} 走り まし た。

        english: He ran with all his might.
        hint: 「全力で走った」 means 'ran with full effort'. 「出し切って」 implies expending *all* available effort

          of completely exhausting one's effort.
    scene: A commentator describing an athlete's peak performance in a competition.

        english: It's hard to cut ties with bad habits.
        hint: 「縁を切るのが難しい」 means it's hard to cut ties. 「断ち切れない」 carries a stronger nuance of being *unable*
          to completely sever ties, implying an inherent difficulty in achieving full separation. We're
          focusing on the complete inability to sever.
    scene: A discussion in a self-help group about overcoming personal challenges.
