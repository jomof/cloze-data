    "etymology": "「とっくに」 is an adverb derived from the older Japanese word 「疾うに (とうに)」, meaning \"long ago\" or \"already.\" 「とっくに」 intensifies this meaning, indicating that something occurred much earlier than expected or is already in the distant past. 「疾 (と)」 implies speed or earliness, emphasizing the considerable time that has passed.",
    "writeup": "「とっくに」 is an adverb that means \"long ago,\" \"already,\" or \"a long time ago.\" It is an emphasized version of 「疾うに (とうに)」, a literary form rarely used in modern Japanese. As a sentence-modifying adverb, 「とっくに」 typically appears at the beginning of a sentence or before the verb it modifies to emphasize that the action happened a long time ago. Compared to structures like 「すでに」 and 「もう」, 「とっくに」 indicates something that occurred much further in the past or is used for exaggeration. It is uncommon to see 「とっくに」 used with a precise time, as the original word 「疾し」 suggests \"far earlier\" or \"at a much earlier time.\"",

            "term": "すでに",
            "meaning": "already; too late",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「とっくに」, 「すでに」 indicates something that has already happened or is too late without emphasizing how long ago it happened. It's often used in more formal contexts."
        },
        {
            "term": "もう",
            "meaning": "already",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「もう」 also means \"already,\" it doesn't have the same sense of something having happened a long time ago as 「とっくに」 does. 「もう」 can refer to something that just happened or is about to happen, and can also mean 'more'."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「すでに」 and 「もう」 can both be used to indicate that something has already occurred, 「とっくに」 emphasizes that the event took place significantly earlier. Use 「とっくに」 when you want to highlight the passage of time or exaggerate how long ago something happened, often with a nuance of completion or a long-standing state.",
