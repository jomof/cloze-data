    "etymology": "「とっくに」 is an adverb derived from the older Japanese word 「疾うに (とうに)」, meaning \"long ago\" or \"already.\" 「とっくに」 intensifies this meaning, indicating that something occurred much earlier than expected or is already in the distant past. 「疾 (と)」 implies speed or earliness, emphasizing the considerable time that has passed.",
    "writeup": "「とっくに」 is an adverb that means \"long ago,\" \"already,\" or \"a long time ago.\" It's an emphasized version of 「疾うに (とうに)」, a literary form rarely used in modern Japanese. As a sentence-modifying adverb, 「とっくに」 typically appears at the beginning of a sentence or before the verb it modifies to emphasize that the action happened a long time ago. Compared to 「すでに」 and 「もう」, 「とっくに」 indicates something that occurred much further in the past or is used for exaggeration. It's uncommon to see 「とっくに」 used with a precise time, as the original word 「疾し」 suggests \"far earlier\" or \"at a much earlier time.\"",
