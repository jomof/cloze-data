meaning: without exception; regardless of; both A and B (and everything in between/like them)
pronunciation:
  katakana: トイワズ トイワズ
  romaji: to iwazu to iwazu
formation:
  Noun A + と言わず + Noun B + と言わず: Indicates that something applies to both Noun A and Noun B, and implies
    it applies to everything similar or within that range, leaving no exceptions.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  function: To express comprehensive inclusion or universality across a range of items, often implied
    by presenting two representative or contrasting examples.
  nuance: Emphatically states that something is true for all instances, leaving no exceptions. It highlights
    the pervasive nature of a phenomenon, behavior, or condition.
etymology: The phrase literally means 'without saying (it's) A, without saying (it's) B'. This construction
  emphasizes the idea of not making distinctions between A and B, thereby extending the implication to
  everything similar or related. It conveys that no matter what specific instance one refers to within
  a category, the stated condition applies universally.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern **〜と言わず〜と言わず** is used to emphatically state that a certain condition, action, or phenomenon applies comprehensively and without exception to all items or individuals within a specified category. It often presents two representative or contrasting examples (Noun A and Noun B) to illustrate the universality, implying that everything else similar to or falling between these two points is also included.

  This expression carries a strong nuance of comprehensiveness and often implies that the extent is surprising or noteworthy. It is typically found in more formal or literary contexts, though it can be used in spoken Japanese for strong emphasis. Unlike simple listing particles like **〜や〜や** or **〜と〜と**, **〜と言わず〜と言わず** actively negates any distinction between the listed items, thereby generalizing the statement to a broader scope.

  It is frequently used to describe situations where a particular state or action is prevalent everywhere, affecting all aspects or people, such as 'from children to adults,' 'from morning to night,' or 'from mountains to the sea.'

  - term: '[Noun]を問わず'
    meaning: regardless of; irrespective of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express a lack of distinction, **〜と言わず〜と言わず** explicitly names two (or more) items
      to show the breadth, implying 'everything like these and in between,' whereas **〜を問わず** states directly
      that a certain condition or category is irrelevant.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]を問わず (regardless of)'
  - term: も〜も
    meaning: both A and B; neither A nor B
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '**も〜も** simply lists two items that share a characteristic, but it doesn''t necessarily imply
      the universality of a phenomenon across *all* similar items. **〜と言わず〜と言わず** suggests a comprehensive
      inclusion that extends beyond just the two listed examples.'
    grammar_point: も (addition or emphasis particle)
  - term: 〜だけでなく
    meaning: not only... but also
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '**〜だけでなく** is an additive pattern, indicating that something applies to A *and additionally*
      to B. In contrast, **〜と言わず〜と言わず** is exhaustive, implying that something applies universally to
      a range or category, exemplified by A and B, and leaving no exceptions.'
    grammar_point: 〜だけでなく・〜ばかりでなく・〜ばかりか (not only... but also)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To differentiate **〜と言わず〜と言わず** from similar expressions, remember its core
  meaning: it emphasizes that something applies universally, to *all* instances within a broad scope,
  often using two illustrative examples. Think of it as ''not just A, not just B, but everything related.''
  For example, while **も子供も大人も** means ''both children and adults,'' **子供と言わず大人と言わず** emphasizes that
  it applies to ''everyone, from children to adults, without distinction.'' **〜を問わず** directly states
  that something is not a factor (e.g., ''regardless of age''), while **〜だけでなく** simply adds more elements
  to a list without necessarily implying complete universality.'
