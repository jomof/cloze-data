pronunciation:
  katakana: ヤクダテル
  romaji: yakudateru
formation:
  Noun/Skill/Experience を 役立てる: To put a noun, skill, or experience to use effectively.
  Verb[て] 役立てる: To put something to use by means of an action (less common, often replaced by other constructions)
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used when something (skill, knowledge, experience, object, etc.) is made useful or beneficial.
  function: To express the action of utilizing something effectively, typically with a positive outcome
    or a specific purpose in mind.
  nuance: Implies a conscious and beneficial application of a resource. It suggests that the item being
    'put to use' is being utilized in a way that maximizes its value or achieves a positive result. It
    often carries a connotation of leveraging something for growth, improvement, or efficiency.
  grammatical-role: Transitive verb, typically taking を for the direct object that is being put to use.
etymology: The verb 役立てる (yakudateru) is a compound verb formed from 役 (yaku), meaning 'role,' 'use,'
  or 'service,' and 立てる (tateru), meaning 'to stand,' 'to establish,' or 'to set up.' Literally, it means
  'to establish a role or use,' which naturally evolved into the meaning of 'to put something to good
  use' or 'to make something useful.' This etymology highlights the proactive and intentional nature of
  making something serve a purpose or provide benefit.
writeup: |-
  役立てる (yakudateru) is a transitive verb that means to **put something to use**, **make good use of it**, or **leverage** it. It implies a conscious effort to utilize a resource, skill, or piece of knowledge effectively for a specific purpose or to achieve a positive outcome. Unlike the more general 使う (tsukau) or even 利用する (riyou suru), 役立てる strongly carries the nuance of beneficial or optimal application.

  This verb is frequently used when discussing how one applies personal skills, professional experience, acquired knowledge, or available resources. For example, you might 経験を役立てる (keiken o yakudateru, put experience to good use) or 知識を役立てる (chishiki o yakudateru, put knowledge to good use). It emphasizes not just the act of using, but the act of making something useful or advantageous.

  While 役立てる can be used in various registers, its inherent meaning of deliberate and effective application often makes it suitable for formal or semi-formal contexts, such as business, academic, or personal development discussions. However, it can also appear in casual conversation to express the same sentiment of beneficial utilization.
false_friends:
  - term: 使う
    meaning: to use (general)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 使う (tsukau) is a general verb for 'to use' and does not inherently carry the nuance of 'putting
      something to good or effective use.' It can refer to any kind of usage, whether beneficial, neutral,
      or even detrimental.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:使う (to do・make)
  - term: 利用する
    meaning: to utilize, to make use of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 利用する (riyou suru) also means 'to utilize' or 'to make use of,' and is often very similar to
      役立てる. However, 利用する can sometimes imply exploiting something or someone, or simply using something
      without the strong positive connotation of effective or beneficial application that 役立てる consistently
      carries. 役立てる almost exclusively implies a positive and constructive application.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:利用する (to utilize)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 役立てる from 使う and 利用する, remember that 役立てる always highlights
  a positive and effective application, focusing on the benefit or usefulness derived. 使う is a broad term
  for any kind of use. 利用する is closer to 役立てる but can be neutral or even negative in connotation, whereas
  役立てる maintains a positive implication of making something truly beneficial.
