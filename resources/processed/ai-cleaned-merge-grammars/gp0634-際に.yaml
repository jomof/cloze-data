    "etymology": "The noun 「際(さい)」 means \"edge,\" \"brink,\" or \"verge.\" The grammar point 「際に」 leverages this to indicate something happening \"at the edge of\" or \"on the verge of\" an event.",
    "writeup": "「際に」is used to express \"when,\" \"at the time of,\" \"in case of,\" or \"on the occasion of\" something. It's more formal than 「時(とき)」 and suggests a more significant or special event. It connects to verbs in dictionary or past tense, or to nouns with 「の」. While 「時」 can refer to any time, 「際に」 often implies a specific situation or action is taken in response to the event. It's **important** to note that using 「際に」 can sound unnatural if the situation always happens the same way. It is considered *katai*, 硬い, or stiff and formal.",
