    "etymology": "The word 「際 (さい)」 itself means \"edge,\" \"verge,\" or \"occasion.\" The addition of 「に」 creates an adverbial phrase that indicates a specific point in time or a particular situation. It suggests being on the \"verge\" of something happening or during a significant event.",
    "writeup": "「際に」 is used to indicate \"when,\" \"at the time of,\" \"in case of,\" or \"on the occasion of.\" It is more formal than 「時 (とき)」 and implies a somewhat important or significant event. 「際に」 appears after verbs in the dictionary or past tense forms, and after nouns with the particle 「の」. While the event is likely to be temporary or one-off, 「際に」 is not limited to one-off situations and can also appear with regularly occurring events. It's **important** to note that 「際に」 sounds unnatural when used with situations that typically do not change or always happen the same way. Use it when there's a sense of anticipation or a specific action being taken during an event.",
