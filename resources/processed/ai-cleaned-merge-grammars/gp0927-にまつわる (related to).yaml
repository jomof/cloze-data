pronunciation:
  katakana: ニマツワル
  romaji: ni matsuwaru
formation:
  Noun + にまつわる + Noun: Indicates that something is related to or associated with the specified noun.
jlpt: N1
etymology: Derived from the verb 「纏わる (まつわる)」, meaning "to coil around," "to cling to," or "to be entangled
  with." This grammar point extends that sense to indicate something is connected to or associated with
  a particular topic, as if stories or information are 'coiling around' the central subject.
writeup: '「にまつわる」 is a formal grammatical pattern used to indicate that something (typically a noun or
  information) is deeply related to, associated with, or surrounds a particular noun or topic. It implies
  a connection that is often historical, legendary, or involves a collection of stories, rumors, or events
  that have grown around a central theme. This pattern generally takes the form **Noun A にまつわる Noun B**.
  Here, **Noun A** is the central topic, and **Noun B** is the information, stories, or items that are
  connected to it. Because of this nuance, words like 「話 (はなし - story)」, 「物語 (ものがたり - tale)」, 「伝説 (でんせつ
  - legend)」, or 「神話 (しんわ - myth)」 frequently appear as **Noun B**. An important point for understanding
  「にまつわる」 is its connection to the verb 「纏わる (まつわる)」. Although the kanji itself is rarely used in modern
  writing, this verb literally means "to coil around" or "to cling to." This original meaning helps to
  grasp the deeper nuance of 「にまつわる」: it''s not just a superficial connection, but rather something that
  is intimately *entangled with* or *has gathered around* the topic at hand. This sense of something "coming
  together around" a subject is key to its usage. While grammatically a verb, 「にまつわる」 functions primarily
  as a modifier in this pattern, akin to an adjective, to connect a noun (the topic) to another noun (the
  related item or information).'
false_friends:
  - term: に関する
    meaning: related to, concerning
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に関する」 is a broader, more general expression for "related to" or "concerning," often used
      for objective facts or topics. 「にまつわる」 implies a more intrinsic, often historical, legendary, or
      emotionally connected relationship, where something "coils around" or is deeply "entangled with"
      the topic.
    grammar_point: 〜について・〜に関して (about・regarding)
  - term: についての
    meaning: about, concerning
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「についての」 is a very general phrase meaning "about" or "concerning," indicating the subject matter
      of information. 「にまつわる」 suggests a deeper, more inherent connection, often implying a collection
      of stories, rumors, or events that have grown around a central theme or subject, conveying a more
      intimate or integral link.
    grammar_point: 〜について・〜に関して (about・regarding)
  - term: 関係がある
    meaning: to be related to, to have a connection
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「関係がある」 is a very general and versatile phrase for indicating a relationship or connection,
      applicable in many contexts. 「にまつわる」, however, implies a deeper, more organic, or historical entanglement,
      often used when stories, traditions, or events have 'gathered around' or 'coiled around' a central
      subject.
    grammar_point: 関係がある (to be related・to have a connection)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「に関する」, 「についての」, and 「関係がある」 can sometimes be used interchangeably with
  「にまつわる」, the latter carries a stronger nuance of an intrinsic, historical, or deeply connected relationship.
  Think of information or events that have organically 'coiled around' or become 'entangled with' a particular
  subject. Choose 「にまつわる」 when the connection is more profound or encompasses a collective body of related
  elements rather than just a simple factual reference.

      hardships are not just topics, but woven into the fabric of his career.
post_example_writeup: 「にまつわる」 is useful for describing connections between topics and related information,
  especially in formal or academic contexts. It adds a layer of sophistication to the language. While
  primarily used in its dictionary form to modify a noun, other conjugations can be used when the context
  requires expressing tense or negation, though they are less common in this specific grammatical pattern.
