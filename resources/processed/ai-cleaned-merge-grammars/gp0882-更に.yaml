    "etymology": "The word 「更に」 comes from the verb 「更ける (fukeru)」, which means \"to grow late\" or \"to advance.\" The kanji 「更」 itself signifies change or renewal. The adverbial use of 「更に」 evolved to indicate a progression beyond the current state, implying something is \"even more advanced\" or \"further along.\"",
    "writeup": "「更に (sarani)」 is an adverb used to express \"even more,\" \"furthermore,\" \"again,\" or \"in addition.\" Its core meaning extends from the kanji 「更」, which suggests an \"approaching change\" or moving beyond a current state. This means that whatever follows 「更に」 will indicate a progression in time, quantity, or intensity beyond an initial statement.\n\nA key nuance of 「更に」 is that it implies something has already reached a certain 'fullness' or 'completion,' and the addition or progression pushes it beyond this existing threshold. This can apply to both positive and negative developments, depending on the context of the sentence. As an adverb, 「更に」 frequently appears at the beginning of a clause, setting the stage for the new information that extends or intensifies what has already been stated.",
