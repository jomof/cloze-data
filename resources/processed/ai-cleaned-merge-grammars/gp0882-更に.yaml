    "etymology": "The word 「更に」 comes from the verb 「更ける (fukeru)」, which means \"to grow late\" or \"to advance.\" The kanji 「更」 itself signifies change or renewal. The adverbial use of 「更に」 evolved to indicate a progression beyond the current state, implying something is \"even more advanced\" or \"further along.\"",
    "writeup": "「更に (sarani)」 is an adverb that means \"even more,\" \"furthermore,\" or \"again.\" It indicates an additional degree or extent of something. It's used to express that something is beyond a certain threshold or has increased in quantity or intensity. 「更に」 often appears at the beginning of a clause to introduce this additional information.",
