    "etymology": "The word 「更に」 comes from the verb 「更ける (fukeru)」, which means \"to grow late\" or \"to advance.\" The kanji 「更」 itself signifies change or renewal. The adverbial use of 「更に」 evolved to indicate a progression beyond the current state, implying something is \"even more advanced\" or \"further along.\"",
    "writeup": "「更に (sarani)」 is an adverb used to express \"even more,\" \"furthermore,\" \"again,\" or \"in addition.\" Its core meaning extends from the kanji 「更」, which suggests an \"approaching change\" or moving beyond a current state. This means that whatever follows 「更に」 will indicate a progression in time, quantity, or intensity beyond an initial statement.\n\nA key nuance of 「更に」 is that it implies something has already reached a certain 'fullness' or 'completion,' and the addition or progression pushes it beyond this existing threshold. This can apply to both positive and negative developments, depending on the context of the sentence. As an adverb, 「更に」 frequently appears at the beginning of a clause, setting the stage for the new information that extends or intensifies what has already been stated.",

            "meaning": "Increasingly, more and more",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "While both indicate increase, 「ますます」 often implies a gradual, continuous increase over time, emphasizing the ongoing nature of the change. 「更に」 can denote a more abrupt or significant additional step."

            "term": "再び",
            "meaning": "Again, once more",
            "kind": "synonym",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「また」 is a broader term that can mean \"again\" or \"also.\" When it means \"again,\" it implies simple repetition. When it means \"also,\" it implies adding another item to a list. 「更に」 specifically emphasizes an increase in degree or moving beyond a threshold."

            "nuance": "「上に」 functions as \"in addition to,\" typically adding another quality or item to a list of characteristics. Unlike 「更に」, it does not carry the nuance of increasing the degree or intensity of something."

            "nuance": "「その上」 is similar to 「上に」 but is often used to add further information, sometimes with a sense of accumulated effect or an unexpected follow-up. It focuses on adding another point to an argument or situation, not necessarily increasing a prior state's degree like 「更に」."

            "term": "しかも",
            "meaning": "Moreover, furthermore",

            "nuance": "「しかも」 is used to add supplementary information that often introduces something surprising or unexpected. Its primary function is to build upon a previous statement with an additional, sometimes contrasting, point. It doesn't imply an increase in degree or pushing beyond a threshold as 「更に」 does."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While expressions like 「ますます」, 「再び」, 「また」, 「上に」, 「その上」, and 「しかも」 share some semantic overlap with 「更に」, their core nuances differ. 「更に」 is best utilized to emphasize an *additional degree* or *further extent* of something, implying a progression beyond a previous state. The other terms focus more on repetition, general addition, or building upon prior information in a different manner. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for precise communication.",
