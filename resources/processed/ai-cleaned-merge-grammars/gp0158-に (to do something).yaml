        "Register": "Generally used in everyday conversation.",

        "Verb[ます-stem] + に + Verb of motion (行く、来る、帰る、入る、出る)": "Indicates the purpose of movement to a place."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 in this construction serves a similar function to the English word \"to\" when expressing purpose. It connects the verb stem (the part of the verb before 「ます」) to a verb of motion, indicating the reason for the movement.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「に」, when used after the ます-stem of a verb and before a verb of motion (like 行く, 来る, 帰る, 入る, 出る), indicates the purpose of moving to a location. It's similar to saying \"in order to\" or \"to do something\" in English. **Important:** This construction is only used with verbs that describe movement from one place to another. Verbs like 歩く (to walk), 走る (to run), and 泳ぐ (to swim) don't usually fit this pattern because they describe the manner of movement rather than movement between locations. This is a basic but essential grammar point for expressing intentions related to movement.",
