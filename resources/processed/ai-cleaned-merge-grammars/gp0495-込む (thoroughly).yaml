    "etymology": "The verb 「込む」 originally means \"to be crowded\" or \"to be packed\". The nuance of being \"packed\" or \"filled\" is extended to the meanings of doing something \"thoroughly\" or getting \"deeply\" involved in something. In other words, the action is so packed into the current state that it is difficult to escape.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「込む」, written with kanji or hiragana, is frequently used as a suffix to convey several different meanings. In this lesson, we will focus on the meanings of 'to remain in (A)', 'to thoroughly do (A)', 'to do (A) deeply', or 'to do (A) intensely'. This form is attached to the conjunctive form (masu-stem) of other verbs. Despite the multiple meanings, 「込む」 can almost always be thought of as 'jamming (B) into (A)'. This means that whatever the (A) action is, will be something that is not easily entered, but also not easily escaped from. It is similar to 切る in some contexts.",
