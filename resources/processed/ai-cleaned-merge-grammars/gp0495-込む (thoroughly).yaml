        "[Verb Stem] + 込む": "Indicates doing something thoroughly, deeply, or intensely; remaining in a state of deep engagement or immersion."

    "meaning": "To do thoroughly; to do deeply; to remain in a state",

        "part-of-speech": "auxiliary verb",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Generally applicable across various contexts, modifying verbs to express intensity, deep engagement, or remaining in a state.",
        "function": "Adds nuance of thoroughness, intensity, deep immersion, or persistent state to the preceding verb.",
        "nuance": "Implies an action or state that is deeply 'packed in' or 'jammed,' making it difficult to reverse or escape, signifying profound involvement or impact."
    },
    "etymology": "The suffix 「込む」 (`komu`) originates from the verb 「込む」, which literally means \"to enter,\" \"to go into,\" \"to be crowded,\" or \"to be packed.\" The development of its usage as a suffix to other verbs reflects an extension of this core meaning. When appended to a verb, 「込む」 retains the nuance of an action being \"packed into\" a state, implying deep immersion, thoroughness, or a sustained, often irreversible, engagement. This metaphorical \"packing\" of the action into the current state or object signifies intensity and completeness, akin to something being filled to capacity or becoming deeply ingrained.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「込む」 (`komu`) is a versatile auxiliary verb or suffix that, when appended to the masu-stem of another verb, adds a nuanced layer of meaning. While the standalone verb 「込む」 primarily means \"to enter\" or \"to be crowded,\" its suffixal use extends this concept to denote an action performed **thoroughly**, **deeply**, or a state in which one **remains** immersed.\nThe fundamental essence of 「込む」 in this usage is the idea of an action or state being deeply \"jammed in\" or \"packed,\" making it difficult to reverse or escape. This implies a significant degree of involvement or a profound impact.\n\nCommon interpretations include:\n*   **Thoroughness/Completeness:** Indicates that an action is carried out exhaustively or meticulously. For instance, 「読み込む」 (`yomikomu`) means to read something thoroughly, not just superficially.\n*   **Deep Immersion/Engagement:** Suggests becoming deeply engrossed in an activity or thought, where one might lose track of time or external surroundings. 「話し込む」 (`hanashikomu`) implies getting deeply involved in a conversation.\n*   **Remaining in a State:** Conveys staying in a particular position or condition, often with a sense of resolve or difficulty in moving from it. 「座り込む」 (`suwarikomu`) implies settling down to sit for an extended period, perhaps due to protest or exhaustion.\n\nWhile 「込む」 can suggest a state that is hard to get out of, it does not necessarily carry a negative connotation. The context dictates whether the deep engagement is positive (e.g., 「打ち込む」 for dedicating oneself) or negative (e.g., 「考え込む」 for getting lost in deep thought, possibly overthinking). This auxiliary verb enhances the main verb by adding a sense of depth, intensity, or sustained effort to the action it describes.",
