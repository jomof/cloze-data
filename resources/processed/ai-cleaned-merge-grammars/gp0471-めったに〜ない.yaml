    "etymology": "The term 「めった」 originally meant 'thoughtless' or 'reckless.' Therefore, 「めったに〜ない」 carries the nuance of 'not doing something without a good reason' or 'not happening unintentionally.' It emphasizes the infrequency of the action or event, suggesting that if it does occur, it is not by chance but due to a specific, rare circumstance.",
    "writeup": "\"めったに〜ない\" expresses that something occurs very rarely, is seldom, or hardly ever happens. The kanji \"滅多\" originally referred to a \"thoughtless\" or \"reckless\" state. Therefore, as an adverb, \"めったに\" literally carried the nuance of \"thoughtlessly\" or \"carelessly.\" When combined with a negative verb form as \"めったに〜ない,\" it implies \"not doing something thoughtlessly (unintentionally)\" or \"not happening without a specific reason.\" This emphasizes that if the action or event does occur, it is not by chance but due to some unusual or specific circumstance, highlighting its infrequency.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   While \"めったに\" can be written with the kanji \"滅多に,\" it is generally more common to see it written in hiragana. Both notations are used.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 'めったに〜ない' which signifies a very low frequency of occurrence, 'あまり〜ない' indicates a low degree or intensity. For example, 'あまり高くない' means 'not very expensive.' 'あまり' can also be used in situations where the frequency is higher than 'めったに'."

            "nuance": "Unlike 'めったに〜ない' which emphasizes the inherent rarity of an event, 'なかなか〜ない' implies that something expected does not easily materialize, or that achievement is difficult.

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "These expressions are often used with negative forms and can be confused due to the common \"〜ない\" ending. However, \"めったに\" focuses on the low frequency of an occurrence, whereas \"ほとんど\" indicates a small quantity or degree, as in \"ほとんど残っていない\" (hardly any left). \"あまり\" denotes a low degree, such as \"あまり美味しくない\" (not very tasty). \"なかなか\" suggests difficulty in achieving something, as in \"なかなか理解できない\" (hard to understand). Lastly, \"陸に\" (ろくに) implies an insufficient state, as in \"陸に食べられない\" (can't eat properly). Understanding the core nuance of each allows for accurate usage in appropriate situations.",
