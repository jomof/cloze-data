    "etymology": "Originally, 「滅多」 is a な-adjective meaning 'thoughtless' or 'reckless.' As an adverb, 「滅多に」 literally means 'thoughtlessly' or 'recklessly.' When used with a negative verb, it conveys the nuance of 'not doing something thoughtlessly' or that something will not happen without a specific reason.",
    "writeup": "「めったに〜ない」 is an expression that means 'hardly,' 'seldom,' or 'rarely.' Originally, 「滅多」 is a な-adjective that means 'thoughtless' or 'reckless.' As an adverb, 「滅多に」 literally means 'thoughtlessly' or 'recklessly.' 「めったに〜ない」 will usually be paired with a verb in the negative form or following a noun with the adverbial particle 「は」.\n\n**Important Note:** It's more common to see 「めったに」 written in hiragana than in kanji; however, both are used.\n\nSince 「めったに」 originally means 'thoughtlessly,' when appearing in a negative statement, the nuance becomes 'to not (A) thoughtlessly' (mindlessly or aimlessly). This simply expresses that the speaker will not do (A) unintentionally, or (A) will not happen unless there is some special reason for it.",
