    "etymology": "The term 「めった」 originally meant 'thoughtless' or 'reckless.' Therefore, 「めったに〜ない」 carries the nuance of 'not doing something without a good reason' or 'not happening unintentionally.' It emphasizes the infrequency of the action or event.",
    "writeup": "「めったに〜ない」 is used to express that something happens rarely, seldom, or hardly ever. 「滅多」 (metta) as a な-adjective means \"thoughtless\" or \"reckless.\" As an adverb, 「滅多に」 (metta ni) literally means \"thoughtlessly\" or \"recklessly.\" Thus, 「めったに〜ない」 paired with a negative verb implies 'not doing something thoughtlessly,' suggesting it will only occur for a specific reason or under special circumstances.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   It's more common to see 「めったに」 written in hiragana than in kanji, though both forms are acceptable.",
