    "etymology": "The term 「ぶり」 comes from 「振り」 (furi), meaning \"style,\" \"manner,\" or \"appearance.\" When used to indicate time passed, it refers to the way time has passed since the last occurrence of something. It is often written in hiragana.",
    "writeup": "「ぶりに」 (burini) is used to indicate that an action or event occurs for the first time after a certain period. It translates to \"for the first time in (A),\" or \"haven't done (B) for (A) time.\" As a suffix, 「ぶりに」 follows a noun indicating the time period. When followed by 「に」 (ni), the sentence provides more details about the action that hasn't been done during that time. You can also use 「ぶりの」 before another noun to modify it, like 「三日ぶりのシャワー」 (mikka buri no shawā, a shower after three days). Be cautious when using 「ぶりに」 with short time intervals like minutes or hours, as it can sound unnatural.",
