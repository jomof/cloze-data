    "etymology": "The term 「ぶり」 comes from 「振り」 (furi), meaning \"style,\" \"manner,\" or \"appearance.\" When used to indicate time passed, it refers to the way time has passed since the last occurrence of something. It is often written in hiragana.",
    "writeup": "「ぶりに」 (burini) indicates that an action or event is occurring for the first time after a specific period. It translates to \"for the first time in (A),\" or \"haven't done (B) for (A) time,\" where (A) is the specified time period. This grammar point inherently carries the nuance that the lapse of time is significant or notable from the speaker's perspective. It should not be used for very short, insignificant intervals like minutes or hours, as it would sound unnatural.\n\nWhen `ぶりに` is used, it functions adverbially, modifying the verb of the action. For instance, in `五年ぶりに会った` (gonen buri ni atta, I met for the first time in five years), `五年ぶりに` modifies `会った`.\n\nAlternatively, `ぶりの` (buri no) can be used to modify a noun, as in `十年ぶりの感動` (jūnen buri no kandō, an emotional experience for the first time in ten years). Here, `十年ぶりの` acts attributively, describing the noun `感動`.",
