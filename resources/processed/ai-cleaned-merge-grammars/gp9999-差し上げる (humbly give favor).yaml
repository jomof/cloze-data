jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: kenjōgo (humble)
  function: Expresses the action of giving or doing a favor in a humble way, elevating the recipient and
    humbling the giver.
  nuance: Conveys extreme respect and humility towards the recipient. It is crucial to use it only when
    the recipient is someone of higher status or deserving of such deference.
  colocation: Often used with honorific prefixes such as お- (o-) or ご- (go-) for the object or the verb
    it modifies in the Te-form (e.g., お持ち差し上げる, ご説明差し上げる).
  grammatical-role: Main verb or auxiliary verb (in Te-form).
etymology: 「差し上げる」(sashiageru) is a compound verb formed from 「差し」(sashi), the continuative form of 「差す」(sasu),
  meaning "to hold up," "to extend," or "to offer," and 「上げる」(ageru), meaning "to raise" or "to give."
  Historically, 「差す」conveyed the act of respectfully presenting something upwards. When combined with
  「上げる」, which also implies raising or giving to a superior, the phrase intensified its humble meaning.
  The etymology thus highlights the physical act of "lifting and offering up" to someone of higher status,
  evolving into the general humble expression for giving.
writeup: 「差し上げる」is a humble verb (謙譲語 - kenjōgo) used to express the action of "giving" or "doing a favor
  for" someone of higher status, such as a superior, an elder, or a customer. This verb serves to humble
  the speaker or the subject of the sentence, thereby elevating the person receiving the action or item.
  It is a fundamental part of polite Japanese communication, especially in business and formal social
  settings. Mastering its usage is key to navigating formal interactions smoothly and demonstrating cultural
  awareness. While its primary function is "to give," it can also be used as an auxiliary verb, often
  in the te-form (〜て差し上げる), to mean "to do (a favor) for someone." In such cases, the action performed
  is done out of respect and service to the elevated recipient.
false_friends:
  - term: あげる
    meaning: to give (general outward giving)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あげる」is a general verb for giving from the speaker to someone else, or from one person to
      another. It implies giving outwards, but it does not carry the same level of humility or respect
      as 「差し上げる」. It's often used among equals or when respect isn't the primary focus. We're looking
      for a humble verb for giving.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:あげる (to give, outward)
  - term: やる
    meaning: to give (casual, often to inferiors, animals, or plants)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「やる」is a very casual verb for giving, typically used for inferiors, animals, or plants, and
      sometimes between very close friends. It implies a downward or equal relationship and lacks any
      sense of respect. We're looking for a humble verb for giving.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:あげる (to give, outward)
  - term: くれる
    meaning: to give (inward giving, to speaker or in-group)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「くれる」is used when someone gives something to the speaker or to someone within the speaker's
      in-group. The direction of the giving is different; the item/favor comes towards the speaker. We're
      looking for a humble verb for giving, not receiving.
    grammar_point: くれる (to give, inward to me・in-group)
  - term: くださる
    meaning: to give (respectful inward giving, to speaker or in-group)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「くださる」is the honorific equivalent of 「くれる」. It is used when a superior or respected person
      gives something to the speaker or in-group. Like 「くれる」, the action moves towards the speaker. We're
      looking for a humble verb for giving, not receiving.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:くださる (respectful give, inward)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the direction and level of respect is crucial when choosing
  among verbs like 「差し上げる」, 「あげる」, 「やる」, 「くれる」, and 「くださる」. 「差し上げる」is used when you are giving humbly
  to a superior. In contrast, 「あげる」is a general "to give" outward, while 「やる」is a casual "to give" outward
  (often to inferiors). 「くれる」and 「くださる」 (the respectful form of 「くれる」) both mean "to give to me/us," indicating
  that the action is directed towards the speaker or their in-group. Always consider who is giving to
  whom, and what level of respect is appropriate for the recipient from the speaker's perspective.
