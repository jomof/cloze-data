    "etymology": "The imperative form's origins vary depending on the verb type. For U-verbs, it's related to the conditional form. For Ru-verbs, it's derived from older verb conjugations. The negative imperative な comes from the prohibitive auxiliary verb.",
    "writeup": "The imperative form in Japanese is used to give commands or make strong requests. However, it's crucial to understand that the imperative form is generally considered **direct and often rude**, especially when used towards superiors or people you don't know well. Its usage is more common among men, particularly when addressing those of lower status or in situations demanding immediate action. In writing, such as in instructions or slogans, the imperative form can convey a sense of urgency or importance.\n\nThere are different formations of the imperative, based on whether the verb is a Group 1 (U-verb), Group 2 (Ru-verb), or irregular verb.\n\n*   **Group 1 (U-verbs):** Change the last vowel sound from 'u' (う) to 'e' (え). For example, 書く (kaku, to write) becomes 書け (kake, write!).\n*   **Group 2 (Ru-verbs):** Drop the 'ru' (る) and add 'ro' (ろ). For example, 食べる (taberu, to eat) becomes 食べろ (tabero, eat!). For formal or written contexts, an older 'yo' ending (e.g., 食べよ) may be encountered.\n*   **Irregular verbs:** 来る (kuru, to come) becomes 来い (koi, come!), and する (suru, to do) becomes しろ (shiro) in spoken language or せよ (seyo) in written language.\n\nThe negative imperative is formed by adding な (na) to the dictionary form of the verb. For example, 食べるな (taberu na, don't eat!). This is generally considered less harsh than the affirmative imperative, but still should be used with caution.",
