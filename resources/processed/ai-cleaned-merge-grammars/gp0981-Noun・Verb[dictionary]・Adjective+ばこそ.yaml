    "etymology": "The grammar point combines the conditional particle 「ば」 with the emphasizing particle 「こそ」. 「ば」 indicates a condition or hypothesis, and 「こそ」 adds emphasis, resulting in the meaning of 'precisely because' or 'only because'.",
    "writeup": "「ばこそ」 is similar to 「からこそ」, indicating that A is the precise reason for B. It translates as \"precisely because of A\" or \"it is only due to A that B\". It combines the conjunction particle 「ば」 and the adverbial particle 「こそ」, used similarly to a sentence-ending particle in this case. 「ばこそ」 follows almost any word type adjusted into its hypothetical form. However, after nouns or な-adjectives, it appears as 「であればこそ」.\n\nIn many cases, A is a reason difficult to conceive as leading to B under normal circumstances, so the speaker emphasizes it with 「こそ」. Note that 「ばこそ」 is very formal and a bit old-fashioned, so 「からこそ」 is almost always preferred in modern Japanese. Thus, consider 「ばこそ」 a more emphatic version of 「からこそ」. It's often used to express a reason that contrasts with expectations.",
