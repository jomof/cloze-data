  pronunciation_warning: The 「いる」 part of 「ている」 is often contracted to 「る」 in casual speech. This applies
    to all conjugations, e.g., 「います」 to 「ます」, 「いて」 to 「って」, 「いた」 to 「た」.
formation:
  Verb (て-form) + いる: Expresses an ongoing action or a state of being resulting from an action.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: General
etymology: The grammar point 「ている」 is a combination of the 「て」-form of a verb, which indicates a manner
  or state, and the verb 「いる」, meaning 'to exist' or 'to be'. Therefore, literally, 「ている」 means 'to exist
  in the state of doing something'. This etymology reflects its function of describing ongoing actions
  or existing states resulting from actions.
writeup: |-
  The 「ている」 form in Japanese is used to express actions currently in progress or states that are the result of a completed action. It is often compared to the "~ing" form in English (e.g., "eating," "studying").

  *   **Ongoing Actions:** This indicates that an action is currently happening. For example, 「食べている」 means "is eating."
  *   **Resultant States:** This describes a state that continues to exist as a result of a previous action. For example, 「知っている」 means "knows" (literally, "is in the state of knowing"). This applies to verbs that describe a momentary action, where the focus is on the state after the action's completion. For instance, 「結婚する」 (to marry) becomes 「結婚している」 (is married).
  *   **Habitual Actions:** When combined with words like `いつも` (always), `毎日` (every day), or `よく` (often), 「ている」 can also indicate a continuous or habitual action, rather than an specific action happening at a specific moment.

  This form is created by attaching 「いる」 to the *te-* form of a verb. While the base form of `いる` is plain, its use in `ている` is adaptable to various registers depending on the ending (e.g., `います` for polite). In casual speech, 「いる」 is often contracted to 「る」, resulting in forms like 「てる」, 「てて」, 「てた」, and 「てます」. Be aware that some verbs, like 「死ぬ」 (to die) and 「知る」 (to get to know), appear in the 「ている」 form to describe a state, which might be translated into the past tense in English. For example, 「死んでいる」 means "is dead" (the state of having died) and 「知っている」 means "knows" (the state of having come to know).

  - term: Verb+て
    meaning: And, Then (Linking events)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While the Verb + て form can link actions sequentially, {ている} specifically describes an ongoing
      action or resultant state. It is not merely a connector.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] (and then)
  - term: ているところだ
    meaning: In the process of doing ~ right now/at this moment
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: '{ているところだ} emphasizes an action happening at this very moment or about to begin, conveying
      a sense of immediacy that {ている} alone does not always carry.'
    grammar_point: ているところ (in the process of)
  - term: ているあいだに
    meaning: While, During the time that ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '{ているあいだに} signifies an action occurring *during* the span of another ongoing activity, whereas
      {ている} simply describes the ongoing action or state itself.'
    grammar_point: ているあいだに (while something is happening)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that the simple 「て」-form connects actions or
  clauses without indicating continuation. 「ているところだ」 adds a layer of immediacy, emphasizing that an action
  is literally happening at this very moment. Meanwhile, 「ているあいだに」 is a temporal phrase that indicates
  an action occurring during the span of another ongoing event. Distinguishing these requires careful
  attention to context and the precise nuance each conveys.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 が 公園 で 遊ん だ。
        english: The children played in the park.

          - 子供 は 公園 で 遊ん で いる。
        english: As for the children, they are playing in the park.
