    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ている」 is a combination of 「て」-form of a verb, indicating a manner or state, and the verb 「いる」, meaning 'to exist' or 'to be'. Therefore, literally, 「ている」 means 'to exist in the state of doing something'. This etymology reflects its function of describing ongoing actions or existing states resulting from actions.",
    "writeup": "The 「ている」 form in Japanese is used to express actions in progress or states that are the result of a previous action. It's equivalent to the \"~ing\" form in English (e.g., \"eating,\" \"studying\").\n\n*   **Ongoing Actions:** Indicates that an action is currently happening. For example, 「食べている」 means \"is eating.\"\n*   **Resultant States:** Describes a state that exists as a result of a previous action. For example, 「知っている」 means \"knows\" (literally, \"is in the state of knowing\"). This applies to verbs that describe a momentary action, whose completed state is what is being described, such as 「結婚する」 (to marry) becoming 「結婚している」 (is married).\n\nThis form is created by attaching 「いる」 to the *te-* form of a verb. 「いる」 is often contracted to 「る」 in casual speech, resulting in forms like 「てる」. Be aware that verbs like 「死ぬ」 and 「知る」 appear in the 「ている」 form to describe a state, which might be translated into the past tense in English. For instance, 「死んでいる」 means \"is dead\" (state of having died) and 「知っている」 means \"knows\" (state of having come to know).",
