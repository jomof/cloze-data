    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ている」 is formed by combining the te-form (て形) of a verb with the auxiliary verb 「いる」, which means \"to exist\" or \"to be.\" This construction literally translates to \"being in the state of doing,\" thus expressing the continuous aspect of an action. Over time, 「ている」 has evolved to become the standard way to express ongoing actions in Japanese.",
    "writeup": "「ている」 is a grammatical construction used to indicate that an action is ongoing or that something is in a continuous state. In English, this is often translated as \"is/am/are ~ing.\" It is formed by attaching 「いる」 to the te-form (「て形」) of a verb. Because 「いる」 is a verb, it can be conjugated to change the tense. For example, 「食べている」 means \"is eating,\" while 「食べていた」 means \"was eating.\"\n\nIt's **important** to remember that 「ている」 doesn't just describe actions happening right now. It can also describe a state resulting from a previous action. For example, 「木が倒れている」 (ki ga taoreteiru) means \"A tree has fallen (and is lying there).\"\n\n「ている」 is used in standard Japanese and is common in everyday speech and writing. Note that 「ている」 is often shortened to 「てる」 in casual speech.",
