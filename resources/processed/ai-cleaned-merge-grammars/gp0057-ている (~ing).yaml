    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ている」 is a combination of the 「て」-form of a verb, which indicates a manner or state, and the verb 「いる」, meaning 'to exist' or 'to be'. Therefore, literally, 「ている」 means 'to exist in the state of doing something'. This etymology reflects its function of describing ongoing actions or existing states resulting from actions.",
    "writeup": "The 「ている」 form in Japanese is used to express actions currently in progress or states that are the result of a completed action. It is often compared to the \"~ing\" form in English (e.g., \"eating,\" \"studying\").\n\n*   **Ongoing Actions:** This indicates that an action is currently happening. For example, 「食べている」 means \"is eating.\"\n*   **Resultant States:** This describes a state that continues to exist as a result of a previous action. For example, 「知っている」 means \"knows\" (literally, \"is in the state of knowing\"). This applies to verbs that describe a momentary action, where the focus is on the state after the action's completion. For instance, 「結婚する」 (to marry) becomes 「結婚している」 (is married).\n*   **Habitual Actions:** When combined with words like `いつも` (always), `毎日` (every day), or `よく` (often), 「ている」 can also indicate a continuous or habitual action, rather than an action happening at a specific moment.\n\nThis form is created by attaching 「いる」 to the *te-* form of a verb. While the base form of `いる` is plain, its use in `ている` is adaptable to various registers depending on the ending (e.g., `います` for polite). In casual speech, 「いる」 is often contracted to 「る」, resulting in forms like 「てる」, 「てた」, and 「てます」. Be aware that some verbs, like 「死ぬ」 (to die) and 「知る」 (to get to know), appear in the 「ている」 form to describe a state, which might be translated into the past tense in English. For example, 「死んでいる」 means \"is dead\" (the state of having died) and 「知っている」 means \"knows\" (the state of having come to know).",
