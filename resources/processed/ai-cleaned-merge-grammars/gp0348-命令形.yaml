        "Register": "Very informal and direct; often considered rude unless used in specific contexts.",

    },
    "etymology": "「命令」 (meirei) means \"command\" or \"order,\" and 「形」 (kei) means \"form.\" Thus, 「命令形」 literally means \"command form.\"",
    "writeup": "The imperative form (命令形 *meireikei*) is a direct way to express commands or instructions in Japanese. However, it's **crucially important** to understand that this form can sound very rude and even threatening if not used carefully.\n\nWhile you'll often see the imperative form on traffic signs or posters (for example, 止まれ！ \"Stop!\"), it's less common in everyday conversation. You might hear it shouted at sports events, during demonstrations, or in urgent situations where a clear, immediate command is necessary.\n\nThere are two primary ways to form the imperative:\n\n*   **う-verbs:** Change the final う sound to an え sound. For example, 書く (kaku, to write) becomes 書け (kake, Write!).\n*   **る-verbs:** Replace る with ろ or よ. For example, 食べる (taberu, to eat) becomes 食べろ (tabero, Eat!) or 食べよ (tabeyo, Eat!). よ is now rare.\n\nWhile both men and women technically *can* use the imperative, softening it with よ is primarily a **masculine pattern**, used between men who know each other well, offering friendly advice or encouragement. For example, saying 頑張れよ to a male friend who is taking a test. In general, women tend to use the て-form (te-form) instead, which is considered more polite.\n\nFinally, note that ある and いる do not have imperative forms, because they express states of existence rather than actions.",
