    "writeup": "The imperative form (命令形 *meireikei*) is a direct way to express commands or instructions in Japanese. It is one of the basic conjugations of verbs.\n\nWhile you'll often see the imperative form on traffic signs or posters (for example, 止まれ！ \"Stop!\"), it's less common in everyday conversation. You might hear it shouted at sports events, during demonstrations, or in urgent situations where a clear, immediate command is necessary.\n\nThere are two primary ways to form the plain imperative:\n\n*   **う-verbs:** Change the final う sound to an え sound. For example, 書く (kaku, to write) becomes 書け (kake, Write!).\n*   **る-verbs:** Replace る with ろ or よ. For example, 食べる (taberu, to eat) becomes 食べろ (tabero, Eat!) or 食べよ (tabeyo, Eat!). The よ ending is now rare and primarily used in written forms or very formal, archaic contexts.\n\nWhen softened with the particle よ, it is primarily a **masculine pattern**, used between men who know each other well to offer friendly advice or encouragement. For example, saying 頑張れよ to a male friend who is taking a test. In general, women tend to use the て-form (te-form) instead, which is considered more polite.\n\nThere is also a polite imperative form, created by attaching 「なさい」 to the ます-stem of a verb (e.g., 食べなさい, 読みなさい). This form is typically used by teachers and parents when speaking to children, or in written instructions like those on test papers. While softer than the plain imperative, it still carries an instructional or authoritative tone.\n\nFinally, note that verbs like ある and いる (which express states of existence rather than actions) do not have imperative forms.",
