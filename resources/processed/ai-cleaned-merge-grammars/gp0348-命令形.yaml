    "etymology": "「命令」 (meirei) means \"command\" or \"order,\" and 「形」 (kei) means \"form.\" Thus, 「命令形」 literally means \"command form.\" The suffix 「な」 for negative imperative likely stems from the negative auxiliary 「ない」, with its final vowel sound shortened and used as a direct prohibition.",
    "writeup": "The imperative form (命令形 *meireikei*) is a direct way to express commands, instructions, or prohibitions in Japanese. It is one of the fundamental conjugations of verbs.\n\nWhile you'll often see the imperative form on traffic signs or public notices (for example, 「止まれ！」 \"Stop!\"), it's less common in everyday conversation due to its directness and potential to sound harsh. You might hear it shouted at sports events, during demonstrations, or in urgent situations where a clear, immediate command is necessary.\n\nThere are several ways to form the plain imperative:\n\n*   **う-verbs:** Change the final う sound to an え sound. For example, 書く (kaku, to write) becomes 書け (kake, Write!).\n*   **る-verbs:** Replace る with ろ or よ. For example, 食べる (taberu, to eat) becomes 食べろ (tabero, Eat!). The よ ending is now rare and primarily used in written forms or very archaic contexts.\n*   **Irregular verbs:** する (suru, to do) becomes しろ (shiro, Do it!), and 来る (kuru, to come) becomes 来い (koi, Come!).\n*   **Negative Imperative:** To prohibit an action, attach 「な」 directly to the dictionary form of the verb. For example, 走るな (hashiruna, Don't run!). This is a very blunt and direct prohibition.\n\nWhen softened with the particle よ, the plain imperative is primarily a **masculine pattern**, used between men who know each other well to offer strong advice or encouragement. For example, saying 「頑張れよ」 to a male friend who is taking a test. In general, women tend to use the て-form (te-form) with softening particles, which is considered more polite.\n\nThere is also a polite imperative form, created by attaching 「なさい」 to the ます-stem of a verb (e.g., 「食べなさい」, 「読みなさい」). This form is typically used by teachers and parents when speaking to children, or in written instructions like those on test papers. While softer than the plain imperative, it still carries an instructional or authoritative tone.\n\nFinally, note that verbs like ある and いる (which express states of existence rather than actions) generally do not have plain imperative forms for direct commands in modern Japanese.",

Consider the social context and your relationship with the listener carefully before using this form.",
