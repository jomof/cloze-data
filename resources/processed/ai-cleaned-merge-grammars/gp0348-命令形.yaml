    "writeup": "The 命令形 (めいれいけい), or imperative form, is used to express direct orders, commands, or strong requests. Due to its direct nature, it can sound rude or forceful if not used carefully. While not as common in everyday conversation, you'll often encounter it on signs, posters, or in urgent situations. It's also sometimes heard at demonstrations, sports events, or when someone needs to issue a quick command.\n\nTo form the imperative, **う-verbs** have their final 「う」 sound changed to the corresponding 「え」 sound. For example, 飲む (のむ - to drink) becomes 飲め (のめ - Drink!). For **る-verbs**, the 「る」 is replaced with either 「ろ」 or 「よ」. For example, 食べる (たべる - to eat) becomes 食べろ (たべろ - Eat!) or 食べよ (たべよ - Eat!). Using 「よ」 is considered more formal and is less common in modern spoken Japanese.\n\nThe imperative form can be softened by adding the particle 「よ」, but this usage is typically limited to men speaking to close male friends, offering advice or encouragement. Women tend to use the て-form for softer commands or requests. ある and いる generally don't have imperative forms because they express existence rather than action. A polite imperative なさい, derived from なさる, is often used by teachers or parents addressing children, and in instructions on tests.\n\nExample: 選びなさい (えらびなさい - Choose!). For speaking to animals, adding the prefix お and using the ます-stem can also serve as a command. For example: お座り (おすわり - Sit!).",
