    "etymology": "「又」 (mata) originally meant 'again' or 'also.' The addition of 「も」 emphasizes that the information being added is in addition to something previously mentioned.",
    "writeup": "「又〜も」 combines the adverb 「又」, a noun, and the adverbial particle 「も」. It translates to \"moreover,\" \"additionally,\" or \"furthermore.\" Since 「も」 is used, the (B) phrase usually presents new information following a statement in the (A) phrase. To use 「又〜も」, an (A) phrase is stated first, followed by 「又」 to introduce the (B) phrase, which then includes a noun + 「も」. For extra emphasis, 「でも」 or 「ても」 can replace 「も」. Fun fact: The kanji 「又」 and 「叉」 share an interesting relationship. 「又」 refers to things that reach a point of separation but then fold back on themselves (translated as \"again\" or \"in addition\"). 「叉」, on the other hand, refers to things that reach a point of separation and then split (translated as \"a fork in the road\" or \"crotch\").",
