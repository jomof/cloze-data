    "etymology": "「かねない」is the negative form of the verb 「兼ねる (kaneru)」, which means \"to do two things at once\" or \"to serve two purposes.\" In the negative, it implies that something is not beyond the realm of possibility, or that it wouldn't be surprising if something were to happen. It suggests that the action is within the realm of capability or possibility.",
    "writeup": "「かねない」 is derived from the negative form of the verb 「兼ねる (kaneru)」, meaning \"to do two things at once.\" When used as a grammar point, it indicates a **possibility**, often of something undesirable. It is similar to saying \"might,\" \"could,\" or \"it's possible that.\" Because 「かねない」 expresses the possibility of an undesirable outcome, it's not used to describe something that is desired.  It is typically used after the ます-stem of a verb. While most often used to highlight negative outcomes, it can occasionally indicate a desired outcome sarcastically. For example, \"If I study everyday, I {might} do well on the test next week.\"",
