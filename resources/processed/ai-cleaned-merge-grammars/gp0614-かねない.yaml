        "part-of-speech": "auxiliary adjective",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "General usage, often used to express a strong possibility of a negative outcome.",
        "function": "To express the strong possibility or capability of something occurring, typically an undesirable event.",
        "nuance": "While primarily used to highlight negative outcomes, it can occasionally be used to indicate a desired outcome sarcastically, implying that the outcome is so easily achievable (or unavoidable) that it's almost humorous or ironic. The speaker often cannot control the outcome being discussed.",
        "counterpoint": "Contrasts with 「かねる」, which implies inability or difficulty."
    },
    "etymology": "「かねない」 is derived from the negative form of the verb 「兼ねる (kaneru)」. Originally, 「兼ねる」 carried the nuance of 'to find difficult' or 'to be unable to (do something).' Thus, 「かねない」, meaning 'not difficult to do' or 'not unable to do,' evolved to express a strong possibility or capability, especially when referring to undesirable or negative outcomes. It suggests that something is well within the realm of possibility or capability.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「かねない」 indicates a strong possibility that something will happen, especially when it is an undesirable outcome that the speaker often cannot control. It is frequently translated as \"might,\" \"could,\" or \"is capable of.\" This expression is typically used after the **ます-stem of verbs** or after **nouns followed by に**.\n\nIt is common to see 「かねない」 follow conditional phrases that include 「と」, 「ば」, 「たら」, or 「でも」, indicating that \"if X were to happen, Y might also occur.\" While the primary use of 「かねない」 is to highlight negative or unfavorable outcomes, it can occasionally be employed sarcastically to imply a desired or even humorous outcome, where the possibility is so evident that it's almost ironic.",

            "meaning": "Cannot, Be unable to, Hard to, Hesitant to",
            "kind": "antonym",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「かねない」, which expresses possibility, 「かねる」 expresses an inability, difficulty, or reluctance to do something. For example, 「理解しかねる」 means 'I find it difficult to understand' or 'I cannot understand'."

        {
            "term": "恐れがある",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「恐れがある」 also expresses the possibility of something undesirable happening. However, 「恐れがある」 tends to be more formal and objective, often used in official warnings or reports, whereas 「かねない」 can be used in a wider range of contexts, including more personal or casual warnings."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "While 「なくはない」 can imply a possibility, it often expresses a weaker or more nuanced possibility, sometimes even a reluctant admission. It's a double negative that softens the statement, implying 'it's not impossible' rather than a direct strong possibility like 「かねない」."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing 「かねない」 from similar expressions, remember that 「かねない」 points to a *strong* and often *undesirable* possibility that is well within the realm of what could happen. 「恐れがある」 shares this focus on negative possibilities but is generally more formal. In contrast, 「かねる」 is its direct opposite, signifying inability or difficulty. 「なくはない」, while also indicating a possibility, implies a weaker or more indirect likelihood.",
