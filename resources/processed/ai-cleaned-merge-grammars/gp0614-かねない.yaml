    "etymology": "The grammar point 「かねない」 comes from the verb 「兼ねる(kaneru)」, meaning \"to do two things at once\" or \"to serve two purposes\". Its negative form, 「兼ねない(kanenai)」, literally means \"not doing two things at once\". It implies that something is within the realm of possibility or not far-fetched. Over time, it has evolved to express the potential for something to happen, especially something undesirable.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「かねない」 is derived from the negative form of the verb 「兼ねる」, and it indicates that something **might happen** or is **capable of happening**, particularly when the speaker can't control the outcome. It's often translated as \"might,\" \"could be,\" or \"is a possibility\".\n\nThis structure connects to the ます-stem of verbs or follows nouns with 「に」. Both kanji and kana forms are used.\n\n「かねない」 often appears after conditional phrases using 「と」, 「ば」, 「たら」, 「でも」, etc., indicating that if one thing happens, another might follow.\n\nWhile mostly used for negative outcomes, 「かねない」 can sarcastically express a desire or wish.\n\nThink of it as something \"not being a stretch\" – the action isn't beyond the capacity or ability of the subject.",
