etymology: The term 「つもり」 (tsumori) originates from the verb 「積もる」 (tsumoru), meaning 'to pile up' or
  'to accumulate'. This concept evolved to signify 'estimation', 'intention', or 'forethought' (like building
  up a plan). In the context of 「～のつもりだ」, it describes a 'piled-up' or 'accumulated' internal belief or
  self-perception. The construction emphasizes a subjective state that one has 'built up' for oneself,
  even if it contradicts external facts.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern 「～のつもりだ」 is used to describe someone's self-perception or their acting as if they are in a certain state, possess a certain quality, or hold a particular identity. It indicates an internal belief or pretense that may or may not align with objective reality.

  This pattern often carries a nuance of discrepancy. The speaker uses 「～のつもりだ」 when they want to convey that someone *thinks* they are X, or *acts* like X, but in reality, they are not, or their actions are not perceived as such by others. It can imply self-deception, overconfidence, or a mistaken belief.

  For nouns, the structure is 「名詞＋の＋つもりだ」. For example, 「私は子供のつもりだ」 (I believe I'm a child/I'm acting like a child). For い-adjectives, it's 「い形容詞＋つもりだ」, such as 「若いつもりだ」 (I think I'm young/I act like I'm young). For な-adjectives, the structure is 「な形容詞＋な＋つもりだ」, like 「真面目なつもりだ」 (I think I'm serious/I act like I'm serious).

  While it often implies a negative or humorous discrepancy, it can also be used neutrally to describe someone's genuine self-identification or how they understand their own role, even if others might have a different perspective. However, the core implication remains the subjective nature of the belief versus an objective truth.

    meaning: to intend to; to plan to; to expect to
    kind: similar expression

  - term: みたい (similar to)
    meaning: looks like; seems like; appears to be

    nuance: Unlike 「[Noun・Adjective]のつもりだ」 which conveys a subjective belief, 「はずだ」 indicates a strong
      logical probability or certainty based on objective information.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]はずだ・はずがない (is expected to be・cannot be)'
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate these expressions, remember that 「～のつもりだ」 focuses on a subjective
  self-perception or pretense, often with a subtle hint that this perception might not be accurate. 「つもりだ」
  on its own is about future intentions. 「みたい」 describes how something appears externally. 「はずだ」 conveys
  a logical expectation based on factual reasoning.
