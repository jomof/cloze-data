    usage-context: General use
  etymology: The grammar point 「つもりで」 comes from the noun 「つもり」 (intention, plan) combined with the particle
    「で」 (by means of, with). Thus, literally, it means "with the intention of". This combination highlights
    the premise or mindset under which an action is performed.
  writeup: |-
    「つもりで」 combines the noun 「つもり」 (intention, plan, belief) with the particle 「で」 (by means of, with). This structure has several uses, depending on the preceding word and the tense. When used with verbs in their plain non-past form, 「つもりで」 indicates that action B is done with the intention of A. For instance, 「駅まで歩いて行くつもりで家を出た」 means "I left the house with the intention of walking to the station." This expresses a planned action or a guiding purpose.

    When paired with verbs in the plain past form, or with nouns and adjectives (in their plain forms, often with a connecting particle like 「の」 or 「な」 for nouns and な-adjectives), 「つもりで」 implies that the speaker or subject is acting as though A, pretending that A, or is convinced that A, even if A is not factually true. For example, 「彼女はもう大人だつもりで、親の言うことを聞かない」 (She acts as if she's already an adult, and doesn't listen to her parents). Here, the 'adult' status is a self-perception or pretense guiding her actions, not necessarily a factual age.

    It is important to note that while 「つもり」 itself can also express pure intention or conviction (as in 「するつもりだ」 meaning "I intend to do"), the addition of 「で」 specifically frames this intention or belief as the *basis* or *premise* for another action or state.

    intention, 「つもりで」 uniquely conveys the mindset or premise under which an action is performed, emphasizing

      nuance: 「健康的な つもりで」 shows the speaker's **belief** or **assumption** about the healthiness of salads,

      register: casual
      setting: cautious
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: no one
      nuance: 「閉めた つもりで いた」 expresses a **mistaken belief** about a past action. The speaker genuinely thought
        they had locked it, and this belief dictated their subsequent actions (or inaction) until the reality
        was discovered. It conveys a sense of realization of an error based on a prior premise.

            approach the situation.
      scene: A mentor advises a younger colleague after a mistake.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: instructional
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The inclusion of 「教訓 だ つもり で」 emphasizes adopting a specific mindset, that is, treating the
        incident as a lesson for growth. The slight variation using 「教訓 の つもり で」 can also be used, making
        the phrase 「教訓」 (lesson) function more like a noun phrase that one 'intends' or 'considers' themselves
        to be, creating a nuance of internalizing the lesson as a part of their identity for the purpose
        of learning.
  post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 「つもりで」 is highly versatile. It can express a
    clear intention for a future action, or it can describe a state of mind where someone is acting 'as
    if' something is true, even if it's not. The context usually makes it clear which nuance is intended,
    especially when paired with past tense verbs or statements that indicate a premise that might be false.
