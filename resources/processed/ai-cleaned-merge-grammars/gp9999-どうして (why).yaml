jlpt: N5
etymology: 'The word 「どうして」(doushite) is formed from 「どう」(dou), meaning ''how,'' and 「して」(shite), which
  is the te-form of the verb 「する」(suru), meaning ''to do.'' Therefore, literally, it means ''how doing''
  or ''by what means.'' This etymological root explains its dual function in Japanese: asking ''why''
  (by what reason or cause) and ''how'' (by what method or means). The ''how'' meaning is a direct descendant
  of its literal components, while the ''why'' meaning evolved from asking ''by what means did this happen?''
  which naturally extends to ''for what reason did this happen?'''
writeup: |-
  「どうして」(Doushite) is a versatile interrogative word in Japanese that can be used to ask both "why" and "how." Its primary usage in everyday conversation leans towards "why," making it a fundamental word for inquiring about reasons and causes.

  When asking "why," 「どうして」 is generally more common and feels softer or more conversational than 「なぜ」(naze). It is often used to express a genuine desire to understand someone's actions or a situation, sometimes carrying a subtle nuance of surprise, confusion, or even a gentle complaint.

  For instance, if someone is late, you might ask, 「どうして遅れたの？」("Why were you late?"). This sounds more natural and less accusatory than using 「なぜ」. The question seeks an explanation, implying a personal curiosity or mild perplexity.

  Although less frequent, 「どうして」 can also be used to ask "how" something is done. In this sense, it is functionally similar to 「どのように」(donoyouni) or simply 「どう」(dou), which strictly mean "how." For example, 「どうしてこれを作るの？」 could mean "How do you make this?" or "Why do you make this?" depending on context. However, for a clear inquiry about method, 「どうやって」(douyatte) or 「どう」 are often preferred to avoid ambiguity.

  In practical use, remember that the context and your tone of voice often determine whether 「どうして」 is interpreted as "why" or "how." When in doubt and specifically asking about a method, opting for 「どうやって」 or 「どう」 can provide more clarity.
false_friends:
  - term: なぜ (why)
    meaning: Why; for what reason
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なぜ」(Naze) is a more formal and objective way to ask 'why.' It often seeks a factual or logical
      explanation and is commonly used in written contexts, official settings, or when you want to sound
      more direct and less emotional. Unlike 「どうして」, it rarely carries a nuance of surprise or personal
      feeling; it's a straightforward inquiry for a reason. We're looking for a softer, more conversational
      way to ask 'why.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:なぜ (why)
  - term: どう (how)
    meaning: How; what way
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どう」(Dou) exclusively means 'how' or 'in what way,' inquiring about a method or state. It
      does not carry the meaning of 'why.' While 「どうして」 can sometimes mean 'how,' 「どう」 is a more direct
      and unambiguous choice when only asking about the method. We're looking for a word that can also
      express 'why.'
    grammar_point: どう (how)
  - term: なんで (why, casual)
    meaning: Why; how come (very casual)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なんで」(Nande) is a highly casual and frequently used equivalent of 「どうして」 and 「なぜ」. It is very
      common in informal speech among friends and family, but might be considered too blunt or informal
      in more polite or formal situations. It can sometimes sound impatient or demanding, depending on
      the tone. We're looking for a slightly less casual, but still conversational, 'why.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:なんで (why, casual)
  - term: どういうこと (what do you mean)
    meaning: What do you mean?; How come?; What's going on?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どういうこと」(Dou iu koto) is used to ask for clarification or an explanation of a situation or
      statement, often because it's confusing or unexpected. It's more about understanding the nature
      or meaning of something rather than just the reason for an action. It can express confusion or bewilderment.
      We're looking for a single word to ask 'why' or 'how.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どういうこと (what do you mean)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To differentiate between these expressions: 「どうして」 is your go-to for a general,
  conversational ''why,'' which can also imply ''how'' in some contexts. 「なぜ」 is for a more direct, objective,
  or formal ''why.'' 「どう」 is strictly ''how,'' asking about method. 「なんで」 is the very casual form of ''why.''
  「どういうこと」 asks for clarification on a situation or statement, meaning ''what do you mean?'' or ''what''s
  the meaning of this?'' Choose wisely based on context, formality, and the specific nuance you wish to
  convey.'

        hint: 「どうやって」 more explicitly asks for the method. Here, 'どうして' implies surprise at the achievement
          itself, perhaps mixed with curiosity about the method. We're looking for a sense of 'how did

        english: Why aren't you eating? (very casual, can be blunt)

    scene: You are at a meal with a friend, and they are not touching their food.

    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The use of the plain form 「食べないの？」 combined with 「どうして」 makes this a gentle, concerned inquiry
      typically used among close friends or family. A male speaker might also use this, but the intonation
      and use of の makes it slightly softer, which is common for female speech.

        english: Why is the sky blue? (more scientific/objective)
        hint: 「なぜ」 is often preferred for factual, scientific questions. 「どうして」 is also acceptable, but
          sounds more like general curiosity rather than a search for a detailed explanation.
    scene: A child asks a curious question about a natural phenomenon to their parent.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: A young male speaker asking a question to an older female listener. The use of 「のですか」 makes
      the question polite and slightly inquisitive, fitting a child's natural curiosity. While not exclusively
      male, this phrasing is common for children learning about the world, and there is no strong gendered
      language in this specific sentence.

    scene: You are discussing a past event where someone became very upset.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective

  registers and settings. It's particularly useful when you want to ask 'why' in a conversational and
  less formal manner, or when expressing a personal sense of surprise or confusion. Pay attention to the
  subtle differences in nuance compared to its false friends to choose the most appropriate word for each
  situation.
