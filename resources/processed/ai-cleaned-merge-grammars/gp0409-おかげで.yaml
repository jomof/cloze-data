    "etymology": "The word 「おかげ」 comes from 「陰(かげ)」 meaning \"shade\" or \"shadow\". The prefix 「お」 adds politeness. The 「で」 particle indicates the reason or cause. The literal meaning is something like \"in the shade of\" or \"under the influence of,\" suggesting that something good happened because of someone or something providing protection or support.",
    "writeup": "「おかげで」 (or 「お陰で」 in kanji) expresses gratitude or indicates a positive result due to someone or something's influence. It's typically translated as \"thanks to (A)\" or \"because of (A)\". The word is a combination of the polite prefix 「お」, the noun 「陰」 ('shade'), and the case-marking particle 「で」. Literally, 「お陰で」 means \"in the shade of (A),\" implying that (B) was only made possible because (A) created the ideal situation.  However, 「おかげで」 can sometimes be used sarcastically, similar to \"thanks to (A)\" in English. In such cases, the negative context is usually clear. It is also commonly used at the beginning of a sentence, much like \"thankfully\" or \"luckily\" in English, to indicate a positive outcome despite the possibility of a negative one.",
