    "etymology": "「とても」 originally meant \"exceedingly\" or \"very much.\" When used with a negative, it intensifies the negation, indicating something is absolutely not the case. Its usage with negative forms evolved to express an absolute inability or impossibility, reflecting a sense of being 'too much' for something to be achieved or endured.",
    "writeup": "「とても〜ない」 is used to express a strong sense of impossibility or complete negation. It signifies that something is \"not at all\" possible or that one \"cannot\" do something at all. It emphasizes the speaker's feeling that something is entirely out of the question. This phrase is frequently used when conveying an emotional or subjective impossibility, rather than a purely objective one. While it often appears with the potential form of verbs (e.g., `できない`, `食べられない`), it can also combine with adjectival nouns like `無理だ` to convey a similar strong sense of impossibility.",

            "nuance": "While 「全然〜ない」 (zenzen ~ nai) also expresses complete negation, it can be used in a wider range of situations for things that are simply not the case or unexpected. 「とても〜ない」 specifically implies a strong sense of *impossibility* or absolute inability.",

            "nuance": "「全く〜ない」 (mattaku ~ nai) is similar to 「全然〜ない」 in expressing complete negation. It can describe something that is entirely absent or untrue. However, 「とても〜ない」 retains its focus on a strong sense of impossibility or difficulty that makes something unachievable.",

            "nuance": "「少しも〜ない」 (sukoshimo ~ nai) emphasizes the lack of even a tiny amount or degree of something. It is about quantity or extent. 「とても〜ない」, in contrast, focuses on the absolute impossibility of an action, state, or event occurring.",
