    "etymology": "「とても」 itself means \"very\" or \"extremely.\" When used with a negative, it intensifies the negation to convey a sense of impossibility or inability. It emphasizes that something is *not* possible to a great degree.",
    "writeup": "「とても〜ない」 expresses a strong sense of impossibility or inability. It's used when you want to emphasize that something is *not* possible or that you *cannot* do something *at all*. Because of its strong nuance of impossibility, it's often used with the potential form of verbs. Although the verb is typically in the negative form, the sentence can still convey impossibility if some other part expresses the speaker's view on the impossibility of something. 「とても」 is supposed to only be used when expressing \"impossibility\", 不可能.",
