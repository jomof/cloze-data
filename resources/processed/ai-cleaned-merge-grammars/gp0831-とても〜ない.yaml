    "etymology": "「とても」 originally meant \"exceedingly\" or \"very much.\" When used with a negative, it intensifies the negation, indicating something is absolutely not the case. Its usage with negative forms evolved to express an absolute inability or impossibility, reflecting a sense of being 'too much' for something to be achieved or endured.",
    "writeup": "「とても〜ない」 is used to express a **strong sense of impossibility** or complete negation. It signifies that something is \"not at all\" possible or that one \"cannot\" do something at all. It emphasizes the speaker's feeling that something is entirely out of the question. This phrase is frequently used when conveying an emotional or subjective impossibility, rather than a purely objective one. While it often appears with the potential form of verbs (e.g., `できない`, `食べられない`), it can also combine with adjectival nouns like `無理だ` to convey a similar strong sense of impossibility.",

The scene highlights the overwhelming nature of the task."
