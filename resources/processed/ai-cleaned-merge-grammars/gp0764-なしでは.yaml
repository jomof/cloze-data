    "meaning": "Without",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Generally used in formal or semi-formal settings.",
        "Function": "Indicates the absence of something and its impact on a situation."
    },
    "etymology": "「なし」 means \"without\" or \"non-existence.\" 「では」 is a particle indicating a conditional or hypothetical situation. Together, 「なしでは」 creates the meaning of \"if there were no [noun]\", implying the consequences of that absence.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なしでは」 expresses the meaning of \"without\" something. It indicates that a certain condition or action is impossible or significantly affected due to the absence of something. It's similar to 「がなければ」 or 「なしには」, but 「なしでは」 is often used to emphasize the necessity of the missing element. 「なしでは」 is a little more emphatic than 「がなければ」.",

                    "competing_grammar": "お金がなければ、生活は難しいです。",

                    "competing_grammar": "お金なしに、生活は難しいです。",
                    "mitigation": "While 「なしに」 shares a similar meaning, 「なしに」 can imply a more neutral absence. The scene conveys a reflective and serious tone, emphasizing the unavoidable consequence, which is more strongly conveyed by 「なしでは」."
