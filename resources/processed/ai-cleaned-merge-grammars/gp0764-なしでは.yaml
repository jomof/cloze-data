        "part-of-speech": "particle",

        "particle-pragmatic-function": "emphasis",
        "function": "Indicates the absence of something and its impact on a situation."
    },
    "etymology": "「なし」 means \"without\" or \"non-existence.\" 「では」 is a particle indicating a conditional or hypothetical situation. Together, 「なしでは」 creates the meaning of \"if there were no [noun]\", implying the consequences of that absence.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なしでは」 expresses the meaning of \"without\" something. It signifies that a certain condition or action is impossible or significantly affected due to the absence of a particular element. This construction emphasizes the necessity of the missing element, indicating that its absence leads to a critical consequence or prevents something from occurring. While similar to expressions like 「〜がなければ」 or 「〜なしには」, 「なしでは」 often carries a slightly stronger nuance of indispensability and the unavoidable negative impact of the absence.",

                    "competing_grammar": "努力をしないと成功はない。",
                    "mitigation": "This alternative expresses a conditional result of not trying. The scene, however, emphasizes a deeper, inherent truth about the prerequisites for success, which 「なしでは」 conveys more strongly."
