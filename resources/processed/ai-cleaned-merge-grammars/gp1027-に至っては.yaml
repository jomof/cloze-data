        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Common in formal speech and writing. It is typically used to highlight an unexpected or unfavorable extreme case within a broader context, often conveying astonishment or dismay.",

        "nuance": "Carries a sense of surprise, exasperation, or dismay regarding the severity or unexpectedness of the example being presented. This extreme example often exacerbates an already negative situation."
    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「に至っては」 is derived from the particle 「に (ni)」, which indicates a point or destination, combined with the て-form of the verb 「至る (itaru)」, meaning \"to reach, arrive at, culminate in.\" The final particle 「は (wa)」 serves as a topic marker, emphasizing the extreme case that follows. Thus, literally, it signifies \"reaching the point of (X), concerning that X...\" This linguistic construction naturally lends itself to highlighting a particular example as the culmination or most striking instance within a given set.",
    "writeup": "「に至っては」 is a compound particle used to introduce the most extreme or surprising example within a particular category or situation. It emphasizes that the presented case is particularly noteworthy, often because it is unexpectedly severe, negative, or astonishing.\n\nThis expression is typically employed in formal speech and writing, reflecting its somewhat elevated and analytical tone. It serves to highlight a culminating point or an instance that stands out as an ultimate example of a preceding statement or trend. For instance, if discussing a general decline, 「に至っては」 would introduce the most egregious example of that decline.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n*   **Extreme Example:** It always points to an example that is at the far end of a spectrum, whether in terms of severity, quality, or unexpectedness.\n*   **Negative or Surprising Nuance:** While not exclusively negative, it very often carries a nuance of dismay, exasperation, or surprise, especially when the extreme example is unfavorable or worse than anticipated.\n*   **Formal Register:** Its usage is more common in formal contexts, such as academic discussions, news reports, or official statements, rather than casual conversation.\n*   **Following Nouns or Nominalized Phrases:** 「に至っては」 almost always follows a noun or a phrase that has been nominalized.\n\nUnderstanding 「に至っては」 requires recognizing that it doesn't merely introduce an example but rather spotlights one that signifies a critical or ultimate point in a progression or evaluation.",
