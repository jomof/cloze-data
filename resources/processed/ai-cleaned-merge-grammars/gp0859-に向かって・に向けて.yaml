    "etymology": "This grammar point originates from the verb 向かう (mukau), meaning \"to face\" or \"to go towards.\" に向かって is the te-form of 向かう combined with に, indicating the direction of an action. に向けて is derived from the transitive verb 向ける (mukeru), implying an intentional aiming or directing towards something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar points に向かって (ni mukatte) and に向けて (ni mukete) both indicate direction, but with distinct nuances.\n\n*   **に向かって (ni mukatte)** generally signifies a physical direction or an action directed towards a specific place or object. It implies a literal facing or heading 'towards' something, often suggesting continuous movement or a direct physical orientation. For example, pointing oneself or an object towards a target.\n*   **に向けて (ni mukete)** often implies a goal, purpose, or target. It suggests that something is being done with a specific aim, for the benefit of someone or something else, or in preparation for an event. It carries the nuance of intentionally 'aiming' or 'directing' an effort or communication towards (A). This is especially true when the objective is to make something 'suitable' or 'appropriate' for (A). This form is typically used for less tangible targets like abstract goals, future timeframes, or specific audiences.",
