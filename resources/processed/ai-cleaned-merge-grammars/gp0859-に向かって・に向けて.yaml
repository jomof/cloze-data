    "etymology": "This grammar point originates from the verb 向かう (mukau), meaning \"to face\" or \"to go towards.\" に向かって is the te-form of 向かう combined with に, indicating the direction of an action. に向けて is derived from the transitive verb 向ける (mukeru), implying an intentional aiming or directing towards something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar points に向かって (ni mukatte) and に向けて (ni mukete) both indicate direction, but with slightly different nuances.\n\n*   **に向かって (ni mukatte)** generally signifies a physical direction or action directed towards a place or object. It implies a facing or heading 'towards'.\n*   **に向けて (ni mukete)** often implies a goal, purpose, or target. It suggests that something is being done with a specific aim or for the benefit of something else. It implies that the speaker is intentionally aiming something towards (A). This is especially true when the objective of the speaker is to make something 'suitable' for (A).",
