    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に向かって」 originates from the verb 「向かう (mukau)」, meaning \"to face\" or \"to go towards.\" The 「て」-form of the verb is used to connect it to the particle 「に」, indicating direction. 「に向けて」 uses the transitive verb 「向ける (mukeru)」, meaning \"to turn towards\" or \"to direct,\" and implies a more intentional action or purpose.",
    "writeup": "「に向かって」 and 「に向けて」 indicate direction, target, or purpose. 「に向かって」, stemming from the verb 「向かう (mukau)」, generally indicates facing or moving in a direction. 「に向けて」, derived from 「向ける (mukeru)」, implies a more intentional action directed towards something, often with a specific goal or purpose in mind. While both can be translated as \"towards\" or \"to,\" 「に向けて」 often carries a nuance of aiming or intending something for a particular target. Consider 「未来に向けて」, meaning \"towards the future,\" showing intentionality toward future goals. Think of it like this: you can walk 「に向かって」 a mountain, but you create a plan 「に向けて」 a successful climb. They are both similar but have slightly different uses.",
