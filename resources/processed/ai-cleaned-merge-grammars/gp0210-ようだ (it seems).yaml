jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: formal
  usage-context: General use
  function: Expresses the likelihood or resemblance of something or someone.
  nuance: Implies the speaker's statement is based on firsthand, reliable information, often visual, leading
    to a high degree of confidence in the observation.
etymology: The origin of 「よう」 as an auxiliary verb often points to the noun 「様」 (sama/yō), meaning 'appearance,'
  'manner,' or 'state.' This etymology explains its core function of describing how something appears
  or seems based on observation or deduction. The particle 「だ」 is the plain form of the copula 「です」, serving
  to affirm or declare this observation. Together, they create a construction that declares a perceived
  'state of appearance' or 'likelihood'.
writeup: |-
  「ようだ」 is an auxiliary adjective used to express observations about something, indicating **likelihood or resemblance** based on direct information or personal experience. Unlike 「みたい」, which is more colloquial and subjective, 「ようだ」 carries a higher degree of certainty and is typically used in more standard or formal contexts. It reflects the speaker's confidence in their statement, often stemming from firsthand, reliable evidence, such as visual evidence.

  This grammar point can be used with various parts of speech:
  *   **Verbs**: Attach directly to the plain form (e.g., 行くようだ - *It seems he's going*).
  *   **い-adjectives**: Attach directly to the plain form (e.g., 寒いようだ - *It seems cold*).
  *   **な-adjectives**: Attach 'な' after the stem (e.g., 静かなようだ - *It seems quiet*).
  *   **Nouns**: Attach 'の' after the noun (e.g., 医者のようだ - *He seems to be a doctor*).
  *   **Demonstratives**: Such as 「その」 to express 'it seems so' (e.g., そのようだ - *It seems so*).

  While 「ようだ」 and 「そうだ」 both express conjecture, 「そうだ」 (when indicating appearance or hearsay) generally implies less confidence. For instance, 「雨が降りそうだ」 (It looks like it's going to rain, based on visual cues like dark clouds) might be used when the speaker is less certain, whereas 「雨が降るようだ」 (It seems it will rain, based on a weather forecast or strong evidence) suggests higher confidence in the observation. Therefore, 「ようだ」 is often a better choice when stating things that are obvious or clearly observable to anyone. It is also common to see 「ようだ」 written with the kanji 「様だ」, particularly in written Japanese or more formal contexts.
false_friends:
  - term: みたい
    meaning: Like, Similar to, Resembling
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「みたい」 is more colloquial and informal than 「ようだ」, often based on a subjective impression rather
      than concrete evidence.
    grammar_point: みたい (appears・resembles)
  - term: そうだ
    meaning: I heard that, It is said that / Seem, Look like
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: When expressing appearance (様態), 「そうだ」 suggests a judgment based solely on superficial visual
      cues and is less confident than 「ようだ」. When expressing hearsay (伝聞), 「そうだ」 relies on indirect information
      or what has been reported, whereas 「ようだ」 is based on the speaker's own observation and deduction.
    grammar_point: そう (looks or seems like)
  - term: らしい
    meaning: Seems like, Apparently, I heard
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「らしい」 often implies a conjecture or inference based on indirect information or common sense,
      where the source might be vague or less objective compared to the direct observation supporting
      「ようだ」.
    grammar_point: らしい (hearsay or conjecture)
  - term: ように・ような
    meaning: As, Just like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ように」 and 「ような」 are primarily used for making comparisons or providing examples, implying
      a metaphorical resemblance rather than a direct deduction about a situation's likelihood.
    grammar_point: ように (like)
  - term: そうに・そうな
    meaning: Seem, Look like, Sound
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These forms mainly describe the appearance or state of something based on how it looks, often
      connecting directly to verbs or adjectives (e.g., 悲しそうに - *looking sad*). They focus more on immediate
      visual impressions rather than a broader deduction like 「ようだ」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:そうに・そうな (looks like)
  - term: にみえる
    meaning: To look, to seem, to appear
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にみえる」 specifically focuses on a visual impression, meaning 'to appear to the eye' or 'to
      look like'. While similar to 「ようだ」 in conveying appearance, 「ようだ」 has a broader scope, encompassing
      deductions from various types of evidence, not just visual.
    grammar_point: にみえる (to look like)
  - term: とみえる
    meaning: It seems that, it appears that, one can conclude that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とみえる」 is a more formal and academic expression emphasizing a logical deduction or conclusion
      drawn from circumstantial evidence, indicating 'it appears to be the case logically.' 「ようだ」 is more
      general and can be based on simpler, direct observations.
    grammar_point: とみえる (seems from observation)
  - term: ときいた
    meaning: I heard that
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ときいた」 is a straightforward expression of hearsay, stating that the speaker received information
      from someone else. It does not carry the nuance of personal observation, inference, or certainty
      that 「ようだ」 does.
    grammar_point: ときいた (I heard that)
  - term: かのようだ
    meaning: As if, Just like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「かのようだ」 specifically implies 'as if' something were true, even though it is not actually the
      case (e.g., まるで夢かのようだ - *It's as if it were a dream*). This contrasts with 「ようだ」, which expresses
      a perceived reality.
    grammar_point: まるで…ようだ (just like)
  - term: ようでは・ようじゃ
    meaning: If, If it is true that
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ようでは」 (and its colloquial variant 「ようじゃ」) indicates a conditional situation, meaning 'if
      it is in such a state/condition' or 'if things are like this'. Its function is to set a condition
      for a negative outcome, which is distinct from 「ようだ」's role in expressing likelihood or resemblance.
    grammar_point: ようでは・ようじゃ (if it seems that)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「ようだ」 fundamentally expresses a highly probable
  deduction or strong resemblance based on direct observation. Contrast this with expressions like 「みたい」
  for casual, subjective impressions, 「そうだ」 for less certain observations or hearsay, and 「らしい」 for inferences
  from indirect information. Phrases like 「ように」 and 「そうに」 are primarily for comparisons or descriptions
  of appearance rather than overall likelihood, while 「ようでは」 introduces a conditional clause. Focusing
  on the source of information—direct observation for 「ようだ」 versus indirect cues or comparison for others—will
  help in distinguishing these similar yet distinct grammatical patterns.

        english: When I woke up, everything was as if it were a dream.
        hint: 「かのようだ」 specifically implies 'as if' something were true, even though it is not, often used

post_example_writeup: When using 「ようだ」, pay close attention to the context and the level of certainty

  or direct observation, offering a more grounded assessment than mere speculation. Its versatility across
  different parts of speech makes it a fundamental tool for expressing nuanced observations in Japanese.
