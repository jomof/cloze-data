details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: To express wishes, hopes, or to make polite, formal requests.
  nuance: Carries a nuance of earnestness or deference, often implying a plea rather than a direct command.
    It can range from a heartfelt wish to a very formal request.
  colocation: Often used with adverbs like 心から (kokoro kara - from the bottom of one's heart), 何卒 (nani
    to zo - earnestly), or with phrases indicating future outcomes.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a main verb, taking direct objects (を) for wishes/hopes, or combined
    with honorifics/verb stems for requests.
  temporal-flow: Can express desires or requests for present, future, or ongoing states or actions.
etymology: The verb 願う (negau) originates from a blend of ancient Japanese terms related to pleading and
  inquiry. Historically, it evolved from expressing humble requests or inquiries to encompassing the broader
  meanings of 'to wish' or 'to request.' The use of the honorific prefix 'お' further enhances the politeness
  and deference inherent in the verb, reflecting a deep-seated cultural value of humility when making
  requests.
writeup: |-
  The verb 願う (ねがう) broadly translates to "to wish" or "to request." Its usage ranges from expressing personal hopes and desires to making polite, formal requests of others.

  When used to express a personal wish or hope, it often takes the form of "[Noun] を 願う" (e.g., 成功を願う - seikō o negau, "to wish for success") or "[Verb-dictionary] ことを 願う." This form conveys the speaker's earnest desire for something to happen or for a certain state to exist.

  When making a request, especially in formal or polite contexts, it can be combined with the honorific prefix お (o) and a verb stem, forming the structure "お + [Verb-stem] + 願う." This construction is a highly respectful and deferential way to ask someone to do something. For instance, お待ち願います (omachi negaimasu) means "Please wait," used in a very polite manner, typically by someone of higher status to an equal or subordinate, or by someone in a service role to a client. The common phrase お願いします (onegai shimasu) is a widely used polite request, literally meaning "I humbly request," and is derived from this very structure.

  It's important to distinguish 願う from simple requests like 〜てください (te kudasai). While both express requests, 〜てください is a more direct and common polite request for an action, whereas 願う implies a more earnest plea or a deferential hope that an action will be taken, often on one's behalf. The formality of 願う makes it less common in everyday casual conversation when simply asking for a small favor.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[たい] (desiderative)
    meaning: to want to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expresses the speaker's personal desire for an action, not a request to others or a general
      wish. For example, 食べたい means "I want to eat."
    grammar_point: Verb[たい] (desiderative)
  - term: Nounが欲しい (to want something)
    meaning: to want something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expresses the speaker's personal desire for a noun, not a wish for an action or a formal
      request. For example, 車が欲しい means "I want a car."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Nounが欲しい (to want something)
  - term: Verb-てほしい (to want someone to do)
    meaning: to want someone to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expresses the speaker's desire for someone else to perform an action. While it involves
      another person, it is a personal wish or expectation, less formal and deferential than 願う. For instance,
      手伝ってほしい means "I want you to help."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb-てほしい (to want someone to do)
  - term: お〜ください (polite request)
    meaning: please do (polite request)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a direct, polite command or instruction. While polite, it lacks the deferential and
      earnest plea nuance often associated with 「お〜願う」. 「ご覧ください」means "Please look." 「お〜願う」is more about
      asking for a favor or hoping an action is taken.
    grammar_point: お〜ください (polite request)
  - term: てください (polite request)
    meaning: please do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the most common and direct polite request. 「願う」is significantly more formal and often
      used in written communication or highly specific formal spoken contexts to convey a deep wish or
      earnest request, rather than a straightforward instruction. For example, 待ってください means "Please wait."
    grammar_point: てください (polite request)
  - term: 望む (to hope)
    meaning: to hope for, to desire
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 望む (nozomu) also means "to hope" or "to desire," it often implies a more active, outward-looking
      hope or expectation for an outcome. 願う, especially when used for personal wishes, can be more passive
      and prayer-like, or when used as a request, carries a stronger sense of deference or earnestness
      than 望む.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:望む (to hope)
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions relate to desires or requests, 願う carries a specific
  nuance of a deeply felt wish or a formal, deferential request. Unlike the more direct expressions of
  desire (〜たい, 〜ほしい, 欲しい) or common polite requests (〜てください, お〜ください), 願う suggests a higher degree of formality
  or earnestness. It often implies a hope that an action will be taken, rather than a direct command.
  It's crucial to understand this distinction to avoid sounding overly formal or even presumptuous in
  casual settings, or conversely, sounding too informal in situations requiring high respect.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 早急 に 返信 し て ほしい です。
        english: I want you to reply promptly.
        hint: 「〜てほしい」expresses a personal desire for someone to do something, which is less formal and
          deferential than 「お願い いたします」. We're looking for a humble, formal request.
    scene: A business professional sending an important email to a client or colleague.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: professional
    nuance: The combination of 「お願い」 (the noun form of 願う, meaning 'request' or 'favor') with the humble
      verb 「いたします」 (humble form of する 'to do') creates an extremely polite and deferential request common
      in business Japanese.
    etymology: The phrase 「お願い いたします」comes from 「お願い」 (the nominalized form of 願う) and 「いたします」 (the humble
      form of する 'to do'). This construction emphasizes the speaker's humility and the earnestness of
      the request, reflecting traditional Japanese etiquette where indirect and humble language is often
      preferred in formal settings to show respect and avoid imposition.

        hint: This is a direct, polite request. The example uses a much more deferential and indirect

          request.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 詳細 の 確認 を お 願い {し ます}。
        english: Please confirm the details (polite).
        hint: 「お願いします」is common but less formal than 「お願いできますでしょうか」, which adds extra layers of politeness
          and tentativeness. We're looking for a softer, more deferential nuance.
    scene: A customer service representative speaking to a customer over the phone.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional

          request.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ご 理解 {ください}。
        english: Please understand.
        hint: This is a direct, polite request. The example uses a much higher level of humility and formality,
          typical for apologies or very serious requests. We're looking for an extremely humble and formal
          request.
    scene: A company representative making a public apology for a serious error.
    register: formal
    setting: apologetic
    nuance: This sentence employs an extremely humble and formal construction. 「何卒 (なにとぞ)」intensifies
      the request, meaning "please; kindly." 「ご 理解 ください ます よう」is a polite way to ask for understanding.
      「お願い 申し上げます」is the highest humble form for making a request, used in situations demanding utmost
      deference.
    etymology: 「何卒 (なにとぞ)」is an old adverb meaning 'by all means; kindly; please.' 「申し上げます」is the humble
      form of 「言う」('to say') or 「する」('to do'), and when combined with 「お願い」 (a request), it elevates the
      request to the highest level of humility. This complex construction reflects historical politeness
      norms where deference and indirectness were paramount in formal communication.

          - 世界 に 平和 を 望む。
        english: I hope for peace in the world.
        hint: 「望む」is closer to 'hope,' while 「願う」here implies a deeper, more personal wish or prayer for
          peace. We're looking for a strong wish for peace.
    scene: A person reflecting quietly on global events, perhaps writing in a diary.

  - english: I ask for your continued support.
    japanese:
      - 今後 と も ご 支援 の ほど {お 願い} {申し上げ ます}。
      - 引き続き の ご 支援 を {お 願い} {申し上げ ます}。
    english_literally: From now on too respectful support of degree humbly request (humble).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今後 と も ご 支援 {ください}。
        english: Please give your continued support.
        hint: 「ください」is a polite but direct request. 「お願い 申し上げます」is a much more formal and humble way to
          solicit ongoing support, often used in public or highly respectful settings. We're looking for
          a humble request for continued support.
    scene: A politician delivering a speech to their constituents, seeking their votes.
    register: formal
    setting: persuasive
    nuance: 「今後 とも」means "from now on as well." 「ご 支援 の ほど」is a highly polite phrasing to ask for support,
      softening the directness. The combination with 「お願い 申し上げます」 (the most humble way to make a request)
      is typical in persuasive or formal address.
    etymology: This phrase combines 「今後 とも」 ('from now on and as always'), the respectful noun 「ご 支援」
      ('support'), and the highly humble 「お願い 申し上げます」. The phrase 「の ほど」, literally 'to the degree of,'
      softens the request, making it sound more indirect and polite, a common feature in formal Japanese
      to avoid direct imposition.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate the versatility of 願う. Notice how the core verb 願う (negau)
  shifts in nuance from a personal wish to a formal request, depending on its conjugation, accompanying
  particles (like を or こと), and especially the addition of the honorific お and humble verbs like いたします
  (itashimasu) or 申し上げます (mōshiagemasu). Mastering these distinctions is key to using 願う appropriately
  in various contexts, from casual reflection to high-level business communication.
