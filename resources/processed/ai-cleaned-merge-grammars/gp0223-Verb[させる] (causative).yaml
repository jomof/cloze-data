details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: formal
  usage-context: General use
  function: To indicate that one person or entity causes or allows another person or entity to perform
    an action.
  nuance: The choice of particle (に vs. を) distinguishes between 'letting' (allowing) with に and 'making'
    (forcing) with を when the original verb is intransitive. When the original verb is transitive, the
    doer is typically marked with に, and the object with を. However, in certain contexts, を can still
    be used for the doer even with transitive verbs, especially to emphasize a stronger sense of forcing.
  grammatical-role: Forms the causative stem of a verb, allowing it to take direct objects for the caused
    action.
  temporal-flow: Implies an action performed by one entity *because* of another's influence or permission.
  spatial-flow: Can involve physical movement or influence directed from one entity to another to facilitate
    an action.
etymology: The auxiliary verbs 「せる」 and 「させる」 are derived from older forms of causative verbs in classical
  Japanese. 「せる」 comes from 「しむ」 (shimu), and 「させる」 comes from 「しめさす」 (shimesasu), both meaning "to cause
  to do." Over time, these evolved into the modern forms 「せる」 and 「させる」, retaining their causative meaning.
writeup: 'To express that someone was "made to do" or "let do" something, the auxiliary verbs 「せる」 and
  「させる」 are used. This meaning is called 使役 (shieki), meaning "causative" or "employment." It''s important
  to understand that 「せる」 and 「させる」 are auxiliary verbs with their own meanings, similar to how 「たい」,
  「ない」, 「だ」, and 「です」 each have their own meanings. Conjugation Rules: る-Verbs: Remove the final 「る」 and
  add 「させる」. (e.g., 食べる → 食べさせる) う-Verbs: Change the final kana to the corresponding あ-sound kana (except
  「う」 becomes 「わ」), and then add 「せる」. (e.g., 読む → 読ませる, 買う → 買わせる) する: Becomes 「させる」. 来る: Becomes 「来させる」
  (こさせる). Particle Usage Nuance: When using causative verbs, either 「に」 or 「を」 can mark the doer of the
  action (the person who is made or let do something). The choice of particle depends on the nuance and
  the transitivity of the original verb. 「に」: Typically implies allowing or letting someone do something.
  This is often used when the original verb is intransitive (e.g., 「子供に遊ばせる」 - to let a child play). When
  the original verb is transitive, the doer is almost always marked with 「に」 (e.g., 「先生が学生に本を読ませる」 - The
  teacher lets the students read books). 「を」: Typically implies making or forcing someone to do something.
  This particle is used when the original verb is intransitive and a stronger compulsion is implied (e.g.,
  「母が子供を早く寝させる」 - My mother makes her child go to bed early). While less common, 「を」 can also be used
  for the doer of transitive verbs, especially in more direct or forceful contexts, although 「に」 is generally
  preferred. When the original verb is transitive, the object of that action is always marked with 「を」.'
false_friends:
  - term: れる られる (passive・potential・spontaneous・respectful)
    meaning: To be done to ~ by ~, Done without consent, Done to one's dismay
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike the causative form which shows actively causing or allowing, 「れる・られる」 indicates a passive
      reception of an action, often implying a negative impact or being forced *by* someone. It does not
      imply the subject is making or letting someone do something, but rather having something done *to*
      them (passive) or doing something naturally (potential).
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (direct passive)
  - term: させられる (causative-passive)
    meaning: To be made to do something, To be forced to do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: The causative-passive form specifically indicates that the subject *was forced* to do something,
      often against their will. This is a distinct grammatical structure from the causative, which can
      imply both 'making' and 'letting', and where the causer is the subject.
    grammar_point: Verb[させられる] (causative-passive)
  - term: になる・くなる (to become)
    meaning: To become (a noun or adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While causative describes an agent causing a change in another (e.g., 「笑顔にさせる」 - to make someone
      smile), 「なる・くなる」 describes a subject undergoing a change independently or as a natural progression,
      without an explicit external agent making the change happen (e.g., 「笑顔になる」 - to become a smile).
    grammar_point: になる・くなる (to become)
  - term: Verb[て]+もいい (permission)
    meaning: It's okay to. it's alright to. can/may
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express permission, 「Verb[て]+もいい」 indicates that an action is permissible from
      the speaker's perspective. The causative 「～させる」 implies the speaker is actively granting or enabling
      the permission for the other person to do something, focusing on the agent's role.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て]+もいい (permission)
  - term: てもらう (to get someone to do)
    meaning: To get someone to do, To have someone do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 'While 「～てもらう」 expresses receiving a favor or benefit from someone''s action, 「～させる」 focuses
      on the subject *causing* or *allowing* the action, whether for benefit or compulsion. The nuance
      of initiative differs: with 「～てもらう」, the other person''s action is performed for the speaker''s
      benefit; with 「～させる」, the subject is the agent of causation.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て]もらう (to have someone do, receive an action)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between these forms, consider the active intent and whether
  the action is imposed, permitted, or happens naturally. 「れる・られる」 is about being affected. The causative-passive
  is about being forced. The causative 「せる・させる」, however, focuses on the agent's role in causing or allowing
  another's action. 「なる・くなる」 describes a natural or uncaused change of state. 「～てもいい」 expresses permission
  as a simple statement, whereas causative implies granting that permission. Lastly, while 「～てもらう」 indicates
  receiving a beneficial action, the causative emphasizes the speaker's active role in making or letting
  that action occur.
examples:
  - english: The teacher lets the students read books.
    japanese:
      - 先生 は 生徒 に 本 を 読ま {せる}
      - 先生 は 生徒 に 本 を 読ま {せ ます}
    english_literally: The teacher causes students to read books.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 は 生徒 に 本 を {読む よう に 言う}
        english: The teacher tells the students to read books.
        hint: 「～ように言う」 implies giving instructions or advice, not necessarily granting permission. We're
          looking for the sense of allowing or enabling an action.
    scene: A teacher outlining a reading assignment.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of 「読ませる」 emphasizes the teacher's active role in 「allowing」 or 「assigning」 the reading.
      This structure highlights the teacher's authority and permission in a formal educational setting.
      The particle 「に」 marks the students as the doers of the action, which is a transitive verb (本を読む).
    etymology: The concept of "allowing" or "permitting" in Japanese often implies a hierarchical relationship
      or a granting of permission, reflecting traditional social structures where authority figures enable
      actions. This usage highlights the teacher's position of authority in the classroom environment,
      where they can grant or deny students certain actions.
  - english: My mother makes her child go to bed early.
    japanese:
      - 母 は 子供 を 早く 寝 {さ せる}
      - 母 は 子供 を 早く 寝 {さ せ ます}
    english_literally: My mother causes her child to sleep early.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 母 は 子供 に 早く 寝る こと を {強制 する}
        english: My mother forces her child to go to bed early.
        hint: 「強制する」 means to explicitly force or compel, which is a stronger and more direct expression
          of coercion than the general causative. We're looking for a verb that allows for both 'making'
          and 'letting'.
    scene: A parent describing their routine for their child.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「寝させる」 here highlights the mother's direct action in 「making」 her child go to bed. The particle
      「を」 instead of 「に」 emphasizes a stronger compulsion, typical for parental guidance, especially in
      a casual family setting. Since 「寝る」 is an intransitive verb, 「を」 marks the forced doer.
    etymology: The use of the causative form for parental control is common, reflecting the role of parents
      in guiding and instructing their children's actions, which has deep roots in traditional Japanese
      family dynamics. It signifies the parent's role in shaping their child's behavior and habits for
      their well-being.
  - english: The manager let me freely state my opinion.
    japanese:
      - 部 長 は 私 に 自由 に 意見 を 言わ {せ た}
      - 部 長 は 私 に 自由 に 意見 を 言わ {せ まし た}
    english_literally: The manager caused me to freely state my opinion.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 部 長 は 私 に 自由 に 意見 を {言う よう に 言っ た}
        english: The manager told me to state my opinion freely.
        hint: 「～ように言った」 means to tell or instruct someone to do something. The causative here implies
          the manager actively enabled or allowed the action, rather than simply giving an order.
    scene: An employee recounting a positive experience with their boss.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「言わせた」 implies the manager 「allowed」 or 「gave permission」 for the speaker to state their opinion,
      suggesting a supportive and open environment. The use of 「に」 marks the person being allowed to do
      the action, as 「意見を言う」 is a transitive verb phrase. This phrasing is common in semi-formal business
      interactions, showcasing a respectful and enabling leadership style.
    etymology: The concept of "allowing" or "permitting" is central to this usage, reflecting the dynamic
      between a superior and a subordinate where the superior enables the subordinate's action, a key
      aspect of respectful workplace communication in Japan.
  - english: The doctor is making the patient take medicine every day.
    japanese:
      - 医者 は 患者 を 毎日 薬 を 飲ま {せ て} いる
      - 医者 は 患者 を 毎日 薬 を 飲ま {せ て} い ます
    english_literally: The doctor is causing the patient to drink medicine every day.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 医者 は 患者 に 毎日 薬 を 飲む よう に {指示 し て いる}
        english: The doctor is instructing the patient to take medicine every day.
        hint: 「指示している」 means to give instructions. While similar, the causative 「飲ませている」 emphasizes the
          doctor's active role in ensuring the patient takes the medicine, implying an ongoing instruction
          or enforcement.
    scene: A nurse discussing a patient's treatment plan.
    register: formal
    setting: technical
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「飲ませている」 indicates the doctor's continuous action of 「making」 the patient take medicine, implying
      ongoing instruction or enforcement. The particle 「を」 highlights the direct effect of the doctor's
      action on the patient. Although 「薬を飲む」 is a transitive verb phrase, 「を」 is used here for the doer
      (患者) to emphasize the doctor's strong, direct compulsion over the patient, which is common in technical
      medical contexts.
    etymology: In medical contexts, the causative is often used to describe professional directives where
      one party is responsible for ensuring another performs a specific action. This reflects the hierarchical
      nature of medical care in Japan, where patient compliance is highly valued for effective treatment.
  - english: She doesn't let her boyfriend lie.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 彼氏 に 嘘 を つ か {せ ない}
      - 彼女 は 彼氏 に 嘘 を つ か {せ ませ ん}
    english_literally: She doesn't cause her boyfriend to lie.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 彼氏 に 嘘 を つく こと を {禁じる}
        english: She forbids her boyfriend from lying.
        hint: 「禁じる」 explicitly means to forbid or prohibit. While both imply prevention, the causative
          「つかせない」 emphasizes her active influence or non-permission, rather than a formal prohibition.
    scene: A friend discussing someone's strict stance on honesty in a relationship.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「つかせない」 emphasizes the girlfriend's active role in preventing her boyfriend from
      lying, rather than just stating that he doesn't lie. This expresses her influence and control in
      the relationship. Since 「嘘をつく」 is a transitive verb phrase, 「に」 is used for the doer (彼氏) when the
      action is not allowed.
    etymology: The negative causative form often conveys a sense of active prohibition or restraint, highlighting
      the agent's intention to prevent an action. In relationships, this can reflect a partner's boundary-setting
      behavior, a common theme across cultures but expressed with specific grammatical structures in Japanese.
  - english: I let the customer come to my office.
    japanese:
      - お 客 さん に 私 の オフィス に 来 {さ せ まし た}
      - お 客 さん に 私 の オフィス に 来 {さ せ た}
    english_literally: I caused the customer to come to my office (polite past).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 客 さん を 私 の オフィス に {招待 し まし た}
        english: I invited the customer to my office.
        hint: 「招待しました」 implies an invitation. While the result might be the same, the causative 「来させました」
          specifically means you enabled or allowed their arrival, focusing on your role in their coming,
          rather than just extending an invitation.
    scene: A business person explaining how they accommodated a client.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「来させました」 with 「お客さん」 implies a respectful granting of permission or arrangement
      for the client to visit, maintaining polite business etiquette. This politeness is characteristic
      of business Japanese speakers when addressing clients or superiors. The 「に」 marks the person being
      allowed to come, as 「来る」 is an intransitive verb, conveying deference.
    etymology: The polite causative form is frequently used in business settings to express facilitative
      actions with respect toward clients or superiors, reflecting the importance of hospitality and service
      in Japanese business culture, where maintaining good client relationships is paramount.
  - english: The new project will probably make him work overtime.
    japanese:
      - 新しい プロジェクト が 彼 を 残業 {さ せる} だろう
      - 新しい プロジェクト が 彼 を 残業 {さ せる} でしょう
    english_literally: The new project will probably cause him to do overtime.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい プロジェクト は 彼 に 残業 を {要求 する} だろう
        english: The new project will probably demand him to work overtime.
        hint: 「要求する」 means to demand. While it implies a similar outcome, the causative 「残業させる」 emphasizes
          the project as the *agent* causing the overtime, rather than simply stating a requirement.
    scene: Colleagues discussing the implications of a demanding new project.
    register: casual
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: Here, 「を」 emphasizes the project's direct influence in 「compelling」 him to work overtime,
      highlighting a stronger causative effect. Since 「残業する」 is an intransitive verb, 「を」 is correctly
      used to mark the forced doer (彼). The casual register is common among coworkers discussing work-related
      pressures, especially between male colleagues, reflecting a shared understanding of workplace demands.
    etymology: This example shows the causative form being applied to inanimate objects or abstract concepts
      (like 'project') as the agent of causation, which is a natural extension of the verb's meaning,
      emphasizing the impersonal forces that can drive human action.
  - english: That happy news made everyone smile.
    japanese:
      - その 嬉しい ニュース が 皆 を 笑顔 に {さ せ まし た}
      - その 嬉しい ニュース が 皆 を 笑顔 に {さ せ た}
    english_literally: That happy news caused everyone to smile.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 嬉しい ニュース で 皆 は 笑顔 に {なり まし た}
        english: Everyone became smiling because of that happy news.
        hint: 「～で～になりました」 expresses a cause-and-effect relationship, where the news is the reason for
          becoming happy. The causative 「笑顔にさせました」 directly states that the news *caused* the smiles,
          emphasizing its active role in transforming the state of others.
    scene: Someone sharing positive news that lifted everyone's spirits.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「笑顔にさせました」 is the causative of "to become a smile" (笑顔になる). It shows the news 「caused」 the
      smiles. The intimate register, reflected by the general and inclusive 「皆 (みんな)」 (everyone), suggests
      a close bond with the listeners, suitable for a female speaker sharing heartwarming news. The use
      of 「を」 emphasizes the direct effect of the news on turning everyone into smiles, as 「笑顔になる」 is an
      intransitive-like change of state.
    etymology: The causative form can also be used with nouns and adjectives followed by 「にする」 to indicate
      a change of state brought about by an external cause, as seen in 「笑顔にする」 (to make someone smile).
      This extension of causative meaning reflects how inanimate subjects can actively influence emotional
      states.
  - english: My younger sister always makes me carry her bag.
    japanese:
      - 妹 は いつ も 私 に 荷物 を 持た {せる}
      - 妹 は いつ も 私 に 荷物 を 持た {せ ます}
    english_literally: Younger sister always causes me to carry her bag.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 妹 は いつ も 私 に 荷物 を {持っ て と 頼む}
        english: My younger sister always asks me to carry her bag.
        hint: 「～と頼む」 means to ask or request. The causative implies a stronger influence or expectation
          that the action will be done, rather than a mere request.
    scene: A sibling complaining good-naturedly about their younger sister's habit.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「持たせる」 here implies a recurring, somewhat habitual action where the younger sister
      「causes」 or 「expects」 the speaker to carry her bag. The particle 「に」 indicates the person being
      made to do the action. As 「荷物を持つ」 is a transitive verb phrase, 「に」 is used for the doer (私). This
      casual and slightly complaining tone is typical of sibling interactions, often heard from younger
      male speakers reflecting a common dynamic in family relationships.
    etymology: This pattern of expressing an obligation or expectation among family members through the
      causative is deeply rooted in Japanese social dynamics, where age and familial roles often dictate
      such interactions.
  - english: The company allowed him to study abroad for a year.
    japanese:
      - 会社 は 彼 に 一 年間 海外 へ 留学 {さ せ た}
      - 会社 は 彼 に 一 年間 海外 へ 留学 {さ せ まし た}
    english_literally: The company caused him to study abroad for one year.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会社 は 彼 が 一 年間 海外 で 留学 する こと を {許可 し た}
        english: The company permitted him to study abroad for a year.
        hint: 「許可した」 means to explicitly permit. The causative 「留学させた」 implies that the company facilitated
          or enabled the study abroad, focusing on their active role in making it happen, rather than
          just granting permission.
    scene: A colleague discussing a former coworker's opportunity.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「留学させた」 highlights the company's decision to 「allow」 or 「enable」 his study abroad, emphasizing
      their active role in providing the opportunity. The particle 「に」 marks the person who was allowed
      to perform the action, which is common when indicating permission with intransitive verbs like 「留学する」.
      This is a typical phrasing in professional environments when discussing corporate policies or employee
      benefits, often from a female speaker conveying official information.
    etymology: This usage reflects a modern corporate context where companies invest in employee development,
      using the causative to express the active facilitation of such opportunities, rather than merely
      granting leave. It shows how the grammar adapts to convey contemporary business practices.
  - english: The new policy made the workers complain.
    japanese:
      - 新しい 政策 は 労働 者 を {不平 を 言わ せ た}
      - 新しい 政策 は 労働 者 を {不平 を 言わ せ まし た}
      - 新しい 政策 は 労働 者 に 不平 を {言わ せ た}
    english_literally: The new policy, as for, workers, made complain.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい 政策 の ため に 労働 者 が 不平 を 言っ た
        english: Workers complained because of the new policy.
        hint: We're looking for the policy *causing* the complaining, not just being the reason for it.
          「～のために」 indicates reason or cause.
    scene: A company executive discussing the impact of a recent change.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: This example shows the causative implying that the new policy 「caused」 or 「forced」 the workers
      to complain. While 「不平を言う」 (fuhei o iu - to complain) is technically transitive with an implied
      object of complaint, 「労働者」 (roudousha - workers) is marked with 「を」 (o), typical when the action
      is caused on the entity itself. This formal usage is common in business or administrative contexts,
      emphasizing the direct impact of decisions.
    etymology: This structure is effective in formal settings for attributing negative outcomes to specific
      policies, reflecting a common Japanese communication style that emphasizes responsibility and causality
      in a professional context.
  - english: I let my younger brother use my new game console.
    japanese:
      - 弟 に 新しい ゲーム 機 を {使わ せ て やっ た}
      - 弟 に 新しい ゲーム 機 を {使わ せ て あげ た}
    english_literally: To younger brother, new game console, let use for him.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 弟 に 新しい ゲーム 機 を 使わ せ て あげ た
        english: I let my younger brother use my new game console (slightly more polite/less direct than
          やった).
        hint: This is an alternative politeness level. 「やる」 is more casual/direct, sometimes implying
          a hierarchy or an action done for someone younger/lower status.
    scene: An older sibling casually sharing their belongings with a younger family member.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「使わせてやった」 (tsukawasete yatta) uses the causative form plus 「やる」 (yaru), a casual form of 「あげる」
      (ageru), implying the speaker allowed the younger brother to use the console as a favor. The particle
      「に」 (ni) marks the recipient of the permission. The use of 「やった」 can sound slightly condescending
      if not used carefully, especially with someone outside one's close in-group or younger relatives.
      This particular phrasing is often heard from older male speakers towards younger male relatives.
    etymology: The combination of the causative with 「やる」 (yaru), particularly among male speakers, reflects
      a traditional familial dynamic where older siblings, especially brothers, might grant permission
      to younger ones with a sense of benevolence or slight condescension.
  - english: That sad movie always makes me cry.
    japanese:

      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 悲しい 映画 を 見る と いつ も 私 は 泣く
        english: When I watch that sad movie, I always cry.
        hint: We're looking for the movie actively *causing* the crying, not just being a condition for
          it. 「～と」 expresses a natural consequence or condition.
    scene: Two friends discussing their favorite (or least favorite) movies.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This is another example of the causative causing an emotion. 「泣かせる」 (nakaseru) means 'to make
      someone cry'. The subject (「あの悲しい映画」) is inanimate, and the object (「私」) is marked with 「を」 (o).
      This casual phrasing is common among friends when discussing shared emotional experiences.
    etymology: The causative form's ability to express emotional impact from inanimate subjects is a nuanced
      extension, showcasing how Japanese grammar can precisely convey subtle influences. This extends
      beyond simple physical actions to psychological effects.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the nuances of particle usage (に vs. を) with the causative form is
  crucial. When the original verb is intransitive, 「に」 implies allowing and 「を」 implies forcing. When
  the original verb is transitive, 「に」 is generally used for the doer (the one performing the action),
  while the original direct object retains 「を」. However, 「を」 can sometimes be used for the doer of a transitive
  verb if the speaker wants to emphasize strong compulsion.
