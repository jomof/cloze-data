    "etymology": "The particle 「て」 is the te-form of a verb, often indicating a sequence of actions or a reason. 「で」 is the particle indicating the location or means of an action. Together, they show the method or means by which something is done.",
    "writeup": "The conjunction particle 「て」, or the case marking particle 「で」, are frequently employed to specify the **means** or **method** by which an action is performed. This 'thing being used' is not necessarily a physical tool; it can also denote a circumstance, condition, or a preceding action.\n\nWhen used with a noun, as in `Noun[で]`, it directly indicates the instrument or means. For example, 「車で」 (by car).\n\nWhen used with a verb in its て-form, as in `Verb[て]`, it often signifies that the action of `Verb` is the method or cause leading to the subsequent action. The nuance conveyed, whether it is a simple sequence of events, a direct tool usage, or a contributing factor, will always depend on the broader context provided by the following clause. Therefore, careful consideration of the entire sentence is crucial to fully grasp the intended meaning.",
