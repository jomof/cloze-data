    "etymology": "The particle 「て」 is the te-form of a verb, often indicating a sequence of actions or a reason. 「で」 is the particle indicating the location or means of an action. Together, they show the method or means by which something is done.",
    "writeup": "The conjunction particle 「て」, or the case marking particle 「で」 are often used to highlight when something is being 'used.' The thing being used does not necessarily need to indicate a tool, but can also indicate a circumstance/situation. In these cases, 「(A)で(B)」 translates as 'with/by means of (A), (B)'.\n\nWith 「て」 (and 「で」), the nuance is quite often that '(A) allowed/led to (B)'. This may be a simple sequence of events, or may be through the direct use of a tool/situation. The nuance that is being highlighted will always depend on the (B) phrase. Due to this, it is important to always read the (B) clause before deciding what the speaker is trying to convey.",
