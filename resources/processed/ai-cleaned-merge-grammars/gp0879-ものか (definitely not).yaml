    "etymology": "「ものか」 is derived from 「もの」 (thing) and 「か」 (question particle). The combination creates a rhetorical question that implies a strong denial or disbelief. Essentially, it's asking \"As if such a thing could be true?\"",
    "writeup": "「ものか」 is a set expression used to strongly suggest that something absolutely will not happen or is definitely not true. It combines the noun 「もの」 (\"thing\") and the adverbial particle 「か」 to convey doubt or uncertainty. Common translations include \"definitely not,\" \"absolutely not,\" and \"do you really think that...?\" The literal meaning is close to \"as if\" in English, posing a strong question to which the speaker already completely disagrees.\n\n「ものか」 can follow verbs and い-adjectives in their plain form, or な-adjectives and nouns followed by 「な」. Other forms, such as 「もんか」, 「もんですか」, and 「ものですか」, exist, with women traditionally more likely to use 「もんですか」 and 「ものですか」. When following the past form (た form) of verbs, 「ものか」 implies the speaker cannot bear for something to happen because they consider it highly negative.\n\nThere are other situations where 「ものか」 is used, but the primary translation as \"as if\" remains helpful, implying shock or disbelief regarding presented conditions, amounts, possibilities, or results.",

            "nuance": "「ものか」 expresses the speaker's strong disbelief that he would ever wear something flashy. The use of 「俺」 emphasizes the speaker's masculinity, and 「バカ言うな」is a very casual and masculine way to start the sentence.",
