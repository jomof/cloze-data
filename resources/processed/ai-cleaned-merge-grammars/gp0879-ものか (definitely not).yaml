    "etymology": "「もの」 is a noun meaning \"thing\" or \"matter,\" and 「か」 is a particle indicating a question. Together, they create a rhetorical question implying disbelief or strong negation, like asking \"As if that's even a thing!\" The combined usage evolved to express strong denial or impossibility.",
    "writeup": "「ものか」 is a set expression used to strongly suggest that a statement is absolutely not going to happen or is definitely untrue. It functions as a rhetorical question that expects a negative answer, expressing the speaker's strong disagreement or disbelief. The implication is similar to saying \"as if!\" in English, conveying a sense of incredulity or vehement denial.\n\nThis expression can be attached to various word types:\n*   **Verbs and い-Adjectives:** Use their plain, non-past forms.\n*   **な-Adjectives and Nouns:** Require 「な」 before 「ものか」 (e.g., 便利**な**ものか, 病気**な**ものか).\n\nOther variants such as 「もんか」, 「もんですか」, and 「ものですか」 are also frequently encountered. 「もんか」 is a casual, contracted form of 「ものか」. 「もんですか」 and 「ものですか」 are more polite forms, often favored by female speakers, conveying the same strong rhetorical negation with a slightly softer nuance.\n\nAdditionally, when 「ものか」 follows the past tense (た form) of verbs, it can imply that the speaker cannot bear for the event to have occurred or to be true, often because they evaluate it as highly negative or undesirable. This usage emphasizes a strong emotional rejection of a past possibility or outcome. While 「ものか」 primarily expresses strong denial, it can also imply the speaker's shock or disbelief in relation to conditions presented in the preceding statement, such as an amount, possibility, or result.",
