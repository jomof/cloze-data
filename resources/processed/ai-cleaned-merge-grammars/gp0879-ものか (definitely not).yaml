    "etymology": "「もの」 is a noun meaning \"thing\" or \"matter,\" and 「か」 is a particle indicating a question. Together, they create a rhetorical question implying disbelief or strong negation, like asking \"As if that's even a thing!\"",
    "writeup": "「ものか」 is a set expression used to strongly suggest that a statement is absolutely not going to happen or is definitely untrue. It's a combination of the noun 「もの」 (\"thing\") and the particle 「か」, which conveys doubt or uncertainty. Common translations include \"definitely not,\" \"absolutely not,\" and \"do you really think that...?\" The implication is similar to saying \"as if!\" in English, expressing strong disagreement or disbelief.\n\nOther variants such as 「もんか」, 「もんですか」, and 「ものですか」 are also frequently encountered. Notably, 「もんですか」 and 「ものですか」 are often used by women, conveying the same strong rhetorical negation with a slightly more polite or softer nuance.",

            "listener_age": "younger",
            "nuance": "The use of 「俺」 emphasizes that the speaker is male. 「バカ 言う な」 and 「着るものか！」 are strong expressions of disagreement, suitable in a casual setting with friends. This strong, masculine denial is characteristic of younger male speech.",
            "etymology": "「バカ」 is a common word for \"fool\" or \"idiot.\""
