    "etymology": "「もの」 is a noun meaning \"thing\" or \"matter,\" and 「か」 is a particle indicating a question. Together, they create a rhetorical question implying disbelief or strong negation, like asking \"As if that's even a thing!\"",
    "writeup": "「ものか」 is a set expression used to strongly suggest that a statement is absolutely not going to happen or is definitely untrue. It's a combination of the noun 「もの」 (\"thing\") and the particle 「か」, which conveys doubt or uncertainty. Common translations include \"definitely not,\" \"absolutely not,\" and \"do you really think that...?\"  The implication is similar to saying \"as if!\" in English, expressing strong disagreement or disbelief.",
