    "etymology": "The phrase 「はおろか」 is derived from the archaic usage of the な-adjective 「おろか」 meaning 'foolish' or 'negligent'. Although 「おろか」 itself isn't commonly used as a standalone adjective in modern Japanese, the phrase 「はおろか」 retains the nuance of 'completely setting aside' something to highlight the obviousness of a subsequent point. It suggests a situation where a basic expectation is not met, implying that a more advanced or significant expectation is therefore also impossible or irrelevant.",
    "writeup": "「はおろか」 functions similarly to 「はもちろん」, meaning \"of course (A), but (B)\". While 「おろか」 as a standalone な-adjective means \"negligent\" or \"alienation,\" its modern usage is mainly confined to set expressions. 「はおろか」 conveys the idea of \"completely putting aside (A), (B)\", implying that if (B) is true, then (A) is even more so. It emphasizes that a situation is so extreme that even a basic or obvious condition is not met, making a more significant condition completely out of the question.\n\nCommon translations include \"let alone (A), (B)\" and \"it's needless to say that (A), when (B)\". (A) and (B) typically belong to the same category, with (B) being more obvious or basic. Often, (B) is followed by an adverbial particle like 「さえ」, 「も」, 「すら」, or 「まで」, emphasizing (B) as the noteworthy minimum extent.\n\nIn essence, 「はおろか」 highlights that if something is true for the less obvious case (A), it's even **more** true for the obvious case (B). Sentences using 「はおろか」 often carry a negative nuance, describing a deficiency or inability that extends from a basic level to a more advanced one. For example, if one cannot do a simple task, then doing a more complex task is certainly impossible.",
