pronunciation:
  katakana: ホドノコトデハナイ
  romaji: hodo no koto dewanai
formation:
  Verb[dictionary form] + ほどのことではない: Indicates an action is not significant enough to be done.
  い-Adjective + ほどのことではない: Indicates a quality is not significant enough to the implied degree.
  な-Adjective[な] + ほどのことではない: Indicates a state or quality is not significant enough to the implied degree.
  Noun + ほどのことではない: Indicates a noun is not significant enough to the implied degree or for a certain

jlpt: N2
etymology: The phrase combines 程 (hodo), meaning "degree" or "extent", 事 (koto), meaning "thing" or "matter",
  and ではない (de wa nai), the negative copula. Literally, it means "it is not to the extent of being a matter/thing".
  This construction emphasizes that a situation or action does not reach a certain level of significance,
  importance, or severity that might be perceived or implied, hence it's "not a big deal" or "not worth
  it."
writeup: |-
  The phrase ～ほどのことではない is used to express that something is not as significant, serious, or difficult as might be implied or perceived. It serves to downplay a situation, suggesting that it doesn't warrant excessive concern, effort, or a strong reaction. While it literally translates to "it's not to the extent of being [something/doing something]", its core meaning is that the matter's degree or importance is less than suggested.

  This expression is highly versatile and can be applied in various contexts:
  *   **Minimizing a problem:** When someone is overly worried or making a big deal out of something minor, you can use this phrase to reassure them that it's not that serious. For example, a small scratch on a car is 修理するほどのことではない (not worth repairing).
  *   **Dismissing an effort:** When an action isn't worth the trouble or the effort involved is disproportionate to the outcome. For instance, 感謝されるほどのことではない (not something to be thanked for so much).
  *   **Understating one's achievements:** To express modesty, implying that what was done was not a big deal or didn't require extraordinary effort.

  It is generally used in casual to semi-formal settings. When used to reassure someone, it carries a warm and empathetic tone. However, when used to dismiss someone's concern without empathy, it can sound dismissive or condescending, so careful consideration of the listener and context is important.

  - term: 〜する必要はない
    meaning: no need to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ～ほどのことではない implies it's not *worth* doing because it's not that significant. The focus is
      on the degree of significance not being met. In contrast, ～する必要はない directly states there is *no
      necessity* for the action, regardless of its significance.
    grammar_point: 必要がある (it is necessary to)
  - term: 大したことない
    meaning: not a big deal
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 大したことない is a more casual, direct, and general way to say "it's not a big deal". It's often
      a general dismissive statement. ～ほどのことではない, while similar, often implies a comparison to a *perceived*
      or *implied* level of importance, emphasizing that the situation does not reach that expected degree
      of severity or consequence.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:大したことない (not a big deal)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both expressions convey a sense of a matter not being significant, ～ほどのことではない
  specifically highlights that something does not reach a certain *degree* or *extent* of importance,
  often in relation to an implied expectation. 大したことない is a broader, more straightforward declaration
  that something is simply not a major issue. When choosing between the two, consider if you want to emphasize
  the *degree* or *scale* of insignificance (～ほどのことではない) or just make a general statement that it's unimportant
  (大したことない).
examples:
  - english: Don't worry so much, it's not something to get angry about.
    japanese:
      - そんな に 心配 し ない で、{怒る ほど の こと で は ない} よ。
      - そんな に 心配 し ない で、{怒る ほど の こと で は あり ませ ん} よ。
      - そんな に 心配 し ない で、{怒る ほど の こと は ない} よ。
    english_literally: Don't worry so much, it's not a matter to the extent of getting angry.

          - そんな に 心配 し ない で、怒る 必要 は ない よ。
          - そんな に 心配 し ない で、怒る 必要 は あり ませ ん よ。
        english: Don't worry so much, there's no need to get angry.
        hint: 「必要はない」 states a lack of necessity. We're looking for a phrase that implies the situation
          is not significant enough to warrant the reaction.
    scene: A friend is panicking over a minor mistake they made.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「よ」 (yo) softens the statement, making it more reassuring rather than dismissive.
      It indicates a gentle downplaying of the situation, suggesting that the friend's reaction is disproportionate
      to the actual problem.
  - english: It's not worth repairing; we can just buy a new one.
    japanese:
      - '{修理 する ほど の こと で は ない} から、新しい の を 買おう。'
      - '{修理 する ほど の こと で は あり ませ ん} から、新しい の を 買い ましょう。'
      - '{修理 する ほど の こと は ない} から、新しい の を 買おう。'
    english_literally: It's not a matter to the extent of repairing, so let's buy a new one.

          - 修理 する 必要 は あり ませ ん から、新しい の を 買い ましょう。
        english: There's no need to repair it, so let's buy a new one.
        hint: 「必要はない」 focuses on the lack of necessity. We're looking for a phrase that suggests the effort
          is not justified by the item's worth or the issue's significance.
    scene: Two people are discussing a broken household item that would be costly to fix.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: This implies that the effort or cost of repair outweighs the value of the item, hence it's
      "not worth" putting that much effort into it. It suggests a practical assessment of the situation.
  - english: It was nothing to be thanked for.
    japanese:
      - '{感謝 さ れる ほど の こと で は ない}。'
      - '{感謝 さ れる ほど の こと で は あり ませ ん}。'
    english_literally: It's not a matter to the extent of being thanked.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 感謝 さ れる ほど で も ない。
          - 感謝 さ れる ほど で も あり ませ ん。
        english: It's not even worthy of thanks.
        hint: The nuance of 「ほどでもない」 is often a stronger, more direct dismissal, implying something is
          *below* a certain standard. We're looking for an expression that suggests something does not
          reach the expected level of significance for a particular response.
    scene: Someone thanks the speaker profusely for a small favor.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: passive (～られる/～かれる)
    nuance: This is a modest expression, stating that the action performed wasn't of such a high degree
      of difficulty or significance that it warranted extensive gratitude. It downplays one's own contribution.
  - english: It's not a situation serious enough to consult a lawyer.
    japanese:
      - 弁護 士 に 相談 {する ほど の こと で は ない} 事態 です。
      - 弁護 士 に 相談 {する ほど の こと で は あり ませ ん} 事態 です。

          the situation doesn't reach the *degree* of seriousness to require a lawyer.
    scene: A colleague is overreacting to a minor work issue, suggesting extreme measures.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The addition of 「事態です」 (jitai desu) makes the statement more formal and objective, indicating
      a calm and measured assessment of the situation's actual severity, suggesting it falls below the
      threshold for legal intervention.
  - english: It's not that good.
    japanese:
      - '{良い ほど の こと で は ない}。'
      - '{良い ほど の こと で は あり ませ ん}。'

        english: It's not very good.
        hint: 「あまり〜ない」 (amari ~nai) indicates a general lack of a quality. We're looking for an expression
          that suggests it doesn't reach a certain implied degree of goodness.
    scene: Someone is praising a new movie mildly, but the speaker doesn't fully agree with the high praise.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: This example directly downplays the quality of something, stating it does not meet an implied
      or expected high standard of "goodness." It's a subtle way to express mild disappointment or a differing
      opinion without being overly negative.
  - english: This isn't something to be exaggerated.
    japanese:
      - これ は {大袈裟 な ほど の こと で は ない}。
      - これ は {大袈裟 な ほど の こと で は あり ませ ん}。

        english: There's no need to exaggerate this.
        hint: 「必要はない」 focuses on the lack of necessity to perform an action. We're looking for a phrase
          that indicates the situation itself does not reach a level where exaggeration is appropriate.
    scene: Someone is making a mountain out of a molehill about a trivial matter.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of the な-adjective 「大袈裟な」 (ōgesa na, exaggerated) directly negates the degree of exaggeration,
      implying the situation is far less dramatic than someone is making it out to be. It gently corrects
      an overreaction.
  - english: This isn't a matter for such a fuss.
    japanese:
      - これ は {お祭り騒ぎ ほど の こと で は ない}。

          - これ は 大した こと あり ませ ん。
        english: This is not a big deal.
        hint: 「大したことない」 is a more general statement that something is not important. We're looking for
          a phrase that specifically states the situation does not reach the *level* of commotion implied.
    scene: A group of friends is overreacting to a very minor inconvenience.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: By using the noun phrase 「お祭り騒ぎ」 (omatsuri sawagi, festival ruckus), the speaker emphasizes
      that the situation does not warrant such an extreme level of excitement, commotion, or fuss. It's
      used to calm an exaggerated response.
  - english: It's not something to think about so deeply.
    japanese:
      - '{深く 考える ほど の こと で は ない}。'
      - '{深く 考える ほど の こと で は あり ませ ん}。'

        english: There's no need to think deeply.

          the situation itself does not require such a high degree of thought.
    scene: A friend is overthinking a simple decision, paralyzed by analysis.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This phrase gently suggests that the level of thought or concern being applied is excessive
      for the matter at hand. It encourages simplicity and discourages over-analysis.
  - english: While it's true I made a mistake, it wasn't serious enough to be fired.

        english: I think it's not a mistake *like* one that would get you fired.
        hint: 「～ような」 implies it's not the *type* of mistake. We're looking for a phrase that suggests
          the mistake does not reach the *severity* to warrant being fired.
    scene: A person is reflecting on their situation after receiving a harsh reprimand at work.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: This expresses a personal judgment that the consequence (being fired) is disproportionate
      to the severity of the mistake. It implies that the mistake, while acknowledged, does not reach
      the level of gravity that would warrant such an extreme punishment.
  - english: It's not even worth mentioning.
    japanese:
      - '{話す ほど の こと で は ない}。'

        english: There's no need to talk about it.
        hint: 「必要もない」 emphasizes that there's no necessity. We're looking for a phrase that indicates
          the matter is so insignificant it doesn't reach the threshold for discussion.
    scene: Someone asks about a trivial incident that happened, and the speaker finds it too insignificant
      to discuss.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang
    nuance: This implies the matter is so insignificant that it does not even warrant the time or effort
      of being discussed. It's a way to dismiss a topic as trivial.
  - english: What I did was nothing to brag about.
    japanese:
      - 私 が し た こと は {自慢 する ほど の こと で は ない}。
      - 私 が し た こと は {自慢 する ほど の こと で は あり ませ ん}。

          - 私 が し た こと は 大した こと あり ませ ん。
        english: What I did is nothing special/not a big deal.
        hint: 「大したことない」 is a general dismissal of importance. We're looking for a phrase that specifically
          states the achievement doesn't reach the *level* that warrants bragging.
    scene: The speaker is being praised by colleagues for a minor achievement at work.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: optimistic
    nuance: This is a modest expression where the speaker downplays their own accomplishment, stating
      that it doesn't reach the level deserving of pride or boasting. It shows humility.
  - english: It's not so bad that you have to cry.
    japanese:
      - '{泣く ほど の こと で は ない} だろう？'

          - 泣く 必要 は ない よ。
          - 泣く 必要 は あり ませ ん よ。
        english: There's no need to cry.
        hint: 「必要はない」 indicates a lack of necessity. We're looking for a phrase that suggests the situation's
          severity does not reach the point where crying is an appropriate response.
    scene: A parent is comforting their young child who has scraped their knee and is very upset.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The rhetorical question 「だろう？」 (darō?) encourages the child to agree that the situation isn't
      severe enough for tears, serving as a gentle form of comfort and reassurance. It implies that the
      emotional response is disproportionate to the actual pain.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, ～ほどのことではない consistently functions to express that something
  does not reach a certain level of significance or does not warrant a particular reaction. It can be
  used to mitigate concerns, express modesty, or calmly assess a situation, making it a valuable phrase
  for nuanced communication in Japanese.
