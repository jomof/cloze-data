    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the verb 「渡る(わたる)」 (wataru), meaning \"to cross\" or \"go across.\" The 「に」 (ni) indicates direction or location, and 「わたって」 (watatte) is the te-form of 「渡る」 (wataru). Together, they create the sense of something extending or spanning across a given area or period, much like crossing from one side to the other.",
    "writeup": "「にわたって」 (ni watatte) signifies that an action, state, or phenomenon extends across a certain range, whether it's a period of time, a physical area, or a numerical range. It is often translated as \"across,\" \"throughout,\" or \"over.\" This pattern is rooted in the verb 「渡る」 (wataru), which means \"to cross,\" thereby implying that the entire span from beginning to end is covered or affected.\n\nThis grammatical structure is highly **formal** and is frequently encountered in written materials such as news articles, official announcements, academic papers, and formal speeches. When used attributively before a noun, it changes to 「にわたる」 (ni wataru).\n\nIt is crucial that the specific span being referred to is clearly indicated, as 「にわたって」 emphasizes the **comprehensiveness** and **continuity** over that entire extent. Unlike more general expressions, it highlights the full coverage of the specified duration or area.",

            "term": "にかけて",
            "meaning": "Over (a period), from ~ until, through",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「にかけて」 (ni kakete) implies a direction, progression, or a range that is not necessarily fully inclusive, while 「にわたって」 (ni watatte) emphasizes the entirety and comprehensiveness of the range or period."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「にわたって」 and 「にかけて」 can refer to a span of time or area, their nuances differ. 「にわたって」 stresses the full and continuous coverage of the entire span from beginning to end. In contrast, 「にかけて」 often suggests a progression or a range from one point *towards* another, or a general period, without necessarily implying full, continuous coverage. For example, 「明日は関東にわたって雨でしょう」 (ashita wa Kantō ni watatte ame deshō) means \"Tomorrow, it will rain throughout the Kanto region,\" indicating widespread rain. However, 「明日は関東にかけて雨でしょう」 (ashita wa Kantō ni kakete ame deshō) would imply that the rain will spread towards or into the Kanto region from another area, or that it will rain intermittently across the region.",
