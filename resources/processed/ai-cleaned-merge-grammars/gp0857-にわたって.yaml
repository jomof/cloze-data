    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the verb 「渡る(わたる)」 (wataru), meaning \"to cross\" or \"go across.\" The 「に」 (ni) indicates direction or location, and 「わたって」 (watatte) is the te-form of 「渡る」 (wataru). Together, they create the sense of something extending or spanning across a given area or period.",
    "writeup": "「にわたって」 (ni watatte) indicates that something extends across a certain range, whether it's a period of time or a physical area. It is often translated as \"across,\" \"throughout,\" or \"over.\" Because it originates from the verb 「渡る」 (wataru) meaning \"to cross\", this grammar pattern implies a span being crossed from start to finish. This structure is considered **formal** and is commonly found in news articles and formal announcements. It is essential to clearly indicate the span being referred to.",
