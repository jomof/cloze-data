    "etymology": "The word 「あれ」 is believed to have evolved from the verb 「あり」 (aru, to exist) combined with the demonstrative prefix 「あ」 (a-). This suggests its original meaning was related to something existing or being located at a distance.",
    "writeup": "「あれ」, like 「これ」 and 「それ」, is a demonstrative pronoun in Japanese, used to indicate an object or place. However, 「あれ」 specifically refers to something that is distant from both the speaker and the listener. It's often translated as \"that over there.\" Be mindful not to confuse 「あれ」 with the interjection 「あれ？」, which expresses surprise or confusion.",
