    "etymology": "The word あれ is believed to have evolved from the verb あり (aru, to exist) combined with the demonstrative prefix あ (a-). This suggests its original meaning was related to something existing or being located at a distance.",
    "writeup": "あれ, like これ and それ, is a demonstrative pronoun in Japanese, used to indicate a particular object or place. However, あれ specifically refers to something that is distant from both the speaker and the listener. It is often translated as \"that over there\" or \"that thing/person over there.\" This distance implies not just physical space, but also a sense of detachment or generality. It is crucial to distinguish あれ from the common interjection \"あれ?\" While spelled the same in hiragana, the interjection functions as a spoken expression of surprise or confusion, akin to \"Huh?\" or \"Oh?\". The difference is typically clear from context and intonation: the interjection \"あれ?\" has a rising tone and implies a question or sudden realization, whereas the demonstrative あれ has a neutral or falling tone.",
