    "etymology": "「あれ」 is derived from the verb 「ある」 (aru, to exist), indicating something that is 'there' or 'existing' at a distance. It's related to 「それ」 (sore, that) and 「これ」 (kore, this), forming a set of demonstrative pronouns indicating relative location.",
    "writeup": "「あれ」, just like 「これ」 and 「それ」, is one of several “pronoun-like” words in Japanese (substitute nouns). 「あれ」 translates roughly to “that” in English. However, unlike 「それ」, 「あれ」 is used to highlight things that are away from both the speaker and the listener. Due to this, it is also often translated as “that over there.” Be careful not to mix up 「あれ」 with the common spoken expression 「あれ」, which means “huh?” or “oh?”. These are not the same words. The difference will usually be clear from context within a sentence, and the way the word is said. 「あれ」 as “huh?” has a rising tone and sounds like a question.",
