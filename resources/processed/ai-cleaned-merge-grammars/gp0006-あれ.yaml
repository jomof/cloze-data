        "usage-context": "Used to refer to something (or someone) that is physically or conceptually distant from both the speaker and the listener. It is a fundamental demonstrative pronoun in Japanese, part of the こそあど series.",
        "function": "Demonstrative pronoun",
        "nuance": "Implies a sense of distance or remoteness. Can also be used to refer to something that is not immediately visible or currently in focus but known to both parties.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a noun substitute, taking the place of the object or person it refers to.",
        "logical-flow": "Establishes a spatial relationship, indicating 'that' in a distant location.",
        "temporal-flow": "Can refer to things distant in time (e.g., 'that time' or 'that past event') though less common than spatial usage.",
        "spatial-flow": "Refers to a location or item far from both speaker and listener, contrasting with これ (near speaker) and それ (near listener)."
    },
    "etymology": "The word あれ is believed to have evolved from the verb あり (aru, to exist) combined with the demonstrative prefix あ (a-). This suggests its original meaning was related to something existing or being located at a distance.",
    "writeup": "あれ, like これ and それ, is a demonstrative pronoun in Japanese, used to indicate an particular object or place. However, あれ specifically refers to something that is distant from both the speaker and the listener. It is often translated as \"that over there\" or \"that thing/person over there.\" This distance implies not just physical space, but also a sense of detachment or generality.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish あれ from the common interjection \"あれ?\" While spelled the same in hiragana, the interjection functions as a spoken expression of surprise or confusion, akin to \"Huh?\" or \"Oh?\". The difference is typically clear from context and intonation: the interjection \"あれ?\" has a rising tone and implies a question or sudden realization, whereas the demonstrative あれ has a neutral or falling tone.",
