    "etymology": "ましょう comes from the volitional form of ます, indicating intention or invitation. か is a question particle.",
    "writeup": "Adding か to the volitional form ましょう creates a polite question expressing an offer or suggestion. It translates to \"Shall we...?\" or \"Shall I...?\" depending on the context. It's used to either offer help or propose doing something together.\n\nThink of it as a more polite and tentative version of just saying ましょう. While ましょう asserts \"Let's do it!\", ましょうか softens the statement into a question: \"Shall we do it?\"\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   The nuance is more of a suggestion than an invitation. For a stronger invitation, ませんか is more appropriate.\n*   The verb should be in its ます stem form before adding ましょうか. For example, 食べます (tabemasu) becomes 食べましょうか (tabemashou ka).",
