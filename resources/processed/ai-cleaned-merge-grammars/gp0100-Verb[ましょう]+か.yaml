    "etymology": "ましょう comes from the volitional form of ます (masu), indicating intent or suggestion. Adding か (ka) turns the statement into a question, softening the suggestion into an inquiry.",
    "writeup": "ましょうか is a polite way to offer a suggestion or ask a question about doing something together. It's derived from ましょう, the volitional form of ます, and the addition of the question particle か. This turns a statement like 「～ましょう」 'Let's do...' into a question: 「～ましょうか」 'Shall we do...?'. Note that it's more of a suggestion than an invitation. For a stronger invitation, ませんか is more appropriate. ましょうか is often used when the speaker is offering help or proposing an action, showing consideration for the listener's preferences. It is very common in polite speech, and is appropriate for both men and women.",

            "etymology": "「日本語 (nihongo)」 combines 「日 (ni)」 'sun, day' with 「本 (hon)」 'origin, book', plus 「語 (go)」 'language', literally meaning 'the language of the origin of the sun'."
