    "etymology": "The etymology of 「びる」 is related to the verb 「めく」 (meku), both sharing the function of adding a sense or characteristic to a preceding noun or adjective stem. 「びる」 specifically implies a visual or sensory impression, and its usage is considered formal.",
    "writeup": "「びる」, like 「めく」, functions as a suffix that transforms a noun or an い-adjective stem into a る-verb. It conveys the sense of \"(A) looking,\" \"(A) seeming,\" or \"behaving like (A).\" This grammatical construction is quite formal and is primarily encountered in written language or very formal speech. It attaches to a limited set of expressions, often indicating that something or someone gives off the visual impression or aura of the preceding word.\n\nFor example, 「古びる」 (furubiru) means \"to look old\" or \"to become old/worn,\" emphasizing the visible state of age. Similarly, 「大人びる」 (otonabiru) means \"to look mature\" or \"to act like an adult,\" focusing on the outward appearance of maturity.\n\nWhen 「びる」 is used to directly modify a noun, it takes its past plain form, 「びた」, as in 「古びた本」 (furubita hon, an old-looking book).\n\nBoth 「びる」 and 「めく」 share a conceptual similarity with the noun-forming suffix 「さ」, which pairs with adjectives to create nouns indicating an extent or quality. Just as 「高さ」 (takasa) means \"height,\" 「びる」 and 「めく」 transform a word into a verb that describes \"having the feeling of (A)\" or, in the past tense, \"having gained the feeling of (A).\"",
