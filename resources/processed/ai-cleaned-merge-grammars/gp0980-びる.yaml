    "etymology": "The verb 「びる」 is thought to share a common conceptual root with 「めく」 (meku), both serving to imbue a preceding word with a characteristic or sensation. While 「めく」 often suggests a subtle hint or sign, 「びる」 tends to emphasize a more concrete visual or sensory impression, conveying that something or someone overtly 'appears as' or 'has the air of' the preceding element. Its formality and descriptive nuance have solidified its place in more refined Japanese expression.",
    "writeup": "「びる」 is a descriptive る-verb suffix that attaches to nouns or the stem form of い-adjectives. It means 'to look like', 'to feel like', 'to have an air of', or 'to become (A)-like'. This grammatical construction is quite formal and is primarily found in written language or highly formal speech, indicating that something or someone visually gives the impression of the preceding word.\n\nFor example, 「大人びる」 (otonabiru) means 'to look mature' or 'to act like an adult', focusing on the outward appearance of maturity. Similarly, 「古びる」 (furubiru) means 'to look old' or 'to become worn', emphasizing the visible state of age or wear. It is important to note that specific forms like 「古びた」 and 「ひなびた」 are almost exclusively used to directly modify nouns.\n\nWhen 「びる」 is used to modify a noun directly, it typically appears in its past plain form, 「びた」, as seen in phrases like 「古びたアルバム」 (furubita arubamu - an old-looking album). This form emphasizes the completed state of having acquired that particular appearance.\n\nBoth 「びる」 and 「めく」 (another descriptive suffix) can be conceptually linked to the noun-forming suffix 「さ」. Just as 「さ」 creates a noun indicating extent (e.g., 「高さ」 - takasa, 'height'), 「びる」 transforms a word into a verb that expresses 'having the feeling of (A)' or, in the past tense, 'having gained the feeling of (A)' based on visual cues.",
