    "etymology": "The etymology of 「びる」is related to the verb 「めく」 (meku), both sharing the function of adding a sense or characteristic to a preceding noun or adjective stem. 「びる」 specifically implies a visual or sensory impression, and its usage is considered formal.",
    "writeup": "「びる」, similar to 「めく」, is a verb used exclusively as a suffix. It's a る-verb, translating to \"(A) looking,\" \"(A) seeming,\" or \"behaving like (A).\" 「びる」 is quite formal and follows a limited set of expressions. It appears after nouns or, occasionally, the stem form of い-adjectives. 「びる」 indicates that, in the speaker's view, something \"gives off the sense of (A)\" and is based on visual information. As a descriptive verb, 「びる」 changes to 「びた」 when linked directly to a second noun. \n\n*Important Considerations*\n\n*   This is formal. You will likely only see this in written language or when someone is being formal.\n*   「古びた」 and 「ひなびた」 are generally used only to modify nouns.",
