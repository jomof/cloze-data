    "etymology": "The particle 「でも」 (demo) originates from 「とて」 (tote), an older particle meaning 'even if' or 'even though', combined with the auxiliary verb 「ある」 (aru) in its attributive form 「の」 (no) and then the particle 「も」 (mo) meaning 'also' or 'too'. Over time, 「とのも」 or 「てのも」 evolved into 「でも」. When used singularly, 「でも」 functions as 'even', 'at least', or 'anything/anyone (at all)'. Its repetition, 「でも〜でも」, specifically emphasizes an inclusive or indifferent choice between two or more options. It asserts that the outcome or statement remains true regardless of which specified option is chosen, highlighting the universal applicability or lack of preference.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Noun+でも〜でも」 is used to express that a statement holds true regardless of which of the specified nouns is chosen. It effectively presents two or more options and states that the main clause applies universally to them. This pattern can be translated as \"whether...or...\" or \"neither...nor...\", depending on whether the accompanying statement is affirmative or negative. The core nuance of 「でも」 in this context is 'even if' or 'no matter', suggesting that the choice between the presented options does not affect the outcome or truth of the statement. This construction is useful when you want to convey flexibility, indifference, or a comprehensive scope regarding the options. It implies that any of the listed items would lead to the same conclusion or is equally acceptable.",
