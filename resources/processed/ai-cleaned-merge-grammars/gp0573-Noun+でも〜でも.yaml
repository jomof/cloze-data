    "etymology": "The particle 「でも」 (demo) originates from 「とて」 (tote), an older particle meaning 'even if' or 'even though', combined with the auxiliary verb 「ある」 (aru) in its attributive form 「の」 (no) and then the particle 「も」 (mo) meaning 'also' or 'too'. Over time, 「とのも」 or 「てのも」 evolved into 「でも」. When used singularly, 「でも」 functions as 'even', 'at least', or 'anything/anyone (at all)'. Its repetition, 「でも〜でも」, specifically emphasizes an inclusive or indifferent choice between two or more options. It asserts that the outcome or statement remains true regardless of which specified option is chosen, highlighting the universal applicability or lack of preference.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Noun+でも〜でも」 is used to express that a statement holds true regardless of which of the specified nouns is chosen. It effectively presents two or more options and states that the main clause applies universally to them. This pattern can be translated as \"whether...or...\" or \"neither...nor...\", depending on whether the accompanying statement is affirmative or negative. The core nuance of 「でも」 in this context is 'even if' or 'no matter', suggesting that the choice between the presented options does not affect the outcome or truth of the statement. This construction is useful when you want to convey flexibility, indifference, or a comprehensive scope regarding the options. It implies that any of the listed items would lead to the same conclusion or is equally acceptable.",

            "meaning": "Whether or not, If...or not",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「Noun+でも〜でも」, which presents two or more concrete options and implies indifference, 「かどうか」 presents a binary choice between a statement and its negation, typically asking for confirmation or expressing uncertainty."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「にしても〜にしても」 often implies a stronger sense of concession than 「Noun+でも〜でも」, suggesting that the outcome remains the same even under different, potentially adverse, circumstances. It can also imply a slight critical or dismissive nuance depending on context."

            "nuance": "While `〜ても〜ても` directly connects two conditional clauses (e.g., 'even if it rains, even if it snows'), `Noun+でも〜でも` connects two nouns, implying the statement holds true for either, often with a nuance of 'regardless of' or 'any kind of' in a less conditional sense."

            "nuance": "Similar to 「にしても〜にしても」, 「にしろ〜にしろ」 also implies a stronger emphasis on the alternatives and their potential outcomes, often used in more formal or assertive contexts. It can also carry a nuance of determination or finality."

It conveys 'either/any of these is fine'."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these expressions share the sense of presenting alternatives, 「Noun+でも〜でも」 is unique in its simple enumeration of possibilities and its implications of “regardless of which”. It often conveys a sense of flexibility or openness to either choice, rather than a concession. To avoid mixing them up, consider if you simply want to list options in a flexible way where any choice yields the same result (use 「〜でも〜でも」), or if you're trying to express something more nuanced like a concession or a definitive binary choice.",
