  '[Noun] を 超える': To exceed [noun] (transitive use).
  '[数値] を 超える': To exceed a [numerical value].
  '[期限] を 超える': To exceed a [deadline].
  '[期待] を 超える': To exceed [expectations].
jlpt: N3
etymology: The kanji 超 (chō) itself signifies 'to surpass,' 'to exceed,' or 'ultra-.' The verb 超える (koeru)
  inherits this fundamental meaning, referring to the act of 'going beyond,' 'crossing over,' or 'exceeding'
  a certain point, limit, or threshold. Its usage has historically encompassed both physical passage and
  more abstract notions of surpassing a standard or expectation, deriving from this core concept of moving
  past a boundary.
writeup: |-
  「超える」 is a versatile verb used to express the action of **exceeding**, **going over**, or **passing a limit or boundary**. This can apply to a wide range of situations, from physical objects crossing a line to abstract concepts like expectations or deadlines being surpassed.

  It is commonly used with the particle 「を」 to indicate the object or boundary that is being exceeded. For example, you might "exceed the speed limit" (速度制限を{超える}), "cross a mountain" (山を{超える}), or "exceed expectations" (期待を{超える}).

  While often transitive, it can sometimes be used in a more intransitive sense where the subject itself is the one surpassing a benchmark, though the boundary is still often marked with 「を」. For instance, 「応募者数が1000人を超えた」 (The number of applicants exceeded 1,000) where the subject (応募者数) is doing the exceeding.

  Nuance often depends on context: exceeding a speed limit is negative, while exceeding expectations is positive. It generally refers to a specific act of passing a mark rather than a continuous state of being beyond it.

  - term: 上回る
    meaning: to exceed, to surpass (in quantity or performance)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「上回る」 is often used in formal or business contexts, particularly for numerical data, performance,
      or results. It emphasizes being *quantitatively* higher. While 「超える」 can also be used for numbers,
      it has a broader application, including abstract concepts or physical boundaries.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:上回る (to exceed, to surpass)
  - term: 超す
    meaning: to cross over, to pass, to exceed
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「超す」 often implies a more direct or physical "crossing" of a boundary or a simple passing
      of a point (e.g., "時を{超す}" - to pass time). While it can overlap with 「超える」, 「超える」 has a slightly
      broader and often more abstract connotation, applicable to limits, expectations, or emotional thresholds.
      「超える」 can also imply overcoming.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:超す (to cross over, to exceed)
  - term: 下回る
    meaning: to fall below, to be less than
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「下回る」 is the direct antonym of 「上回る」 and is primarily used for quantitative comparison, indicating
      that something is less than a certain value or expectation.
    grammar_point: 下回る (to fall below)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「超える」, 「上回る」, and 「超す」 all convey the idea of exceeding, their nuances
  differ. 「超える」 is the most versatile, applicable to various contexts from physical barriers to abstract
  limits and expectations. 「上回る」 focuses specifically on surpassing in quantity or performance, often
  in formal or statistical contexts. 「超す」 often implies a direct act of physically crossing or simply
  passing a point in time or age. The choice depends on the specific context and the type of 'limit' being
  surpassed. 「下回る」 is the direct opposite of 「上回る」, meaning to fall below a certain level.
