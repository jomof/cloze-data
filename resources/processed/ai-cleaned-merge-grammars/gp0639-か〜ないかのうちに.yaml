    "writeup": "The grammar point 「か〜ないかのうちに」 is a somewhat formal expression used to describe something that happens almost immediately after something else. The structure highlights the narrow window of time where the action (A) is neither confirmed to have started nor completed. The verb is repeated in dictionary form and negative form (ない-form). It emphasizes the immediacy of the action (B) following action (A). Common translations include \"right after (A),\" \"as soon as (A),\" and \"barely when (A).\" It is used to emphasize short periods where something unexpected happens.",
