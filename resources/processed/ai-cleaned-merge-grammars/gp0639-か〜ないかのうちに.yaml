    "writeup": "The grammar point 「か〜ないかのうちに」 is a precise and somewhat formal expression in Japanese. It describes a situation where an action (B) occurs at the exact moment another action (A) is on the cusp of starting or finishing, making it unclear whether (A) has truly begun or concluded. It emphasizes an extremely narrow, almost imperceptible timeframe.\n\nStructurally, it repeats the same verb, first in its dictionary form, followed by か, then in its negative (ない) form, followed by か, and finally のうちに. This literal construction, \"while not knowing whether [verb] or not [verb],\" effectively conveys the immediacy.\n\nCommon English translations include \"right after,\" \"as soon as,\" \"just when,\" or \"barely when.\" It is often used to highlight events that happen with surprising speed or at a critical, fleeting moment, particularly when the quickness might be unexpected or impactful.",
