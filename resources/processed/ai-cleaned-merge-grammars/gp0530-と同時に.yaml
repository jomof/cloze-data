    "etymology": "「と同時に」is composed of 「と」(a particle indicating simultaneity or listing), 「同時」(douji, meaning \"same time\"), and 「に」(a particle marking a point in time or location). The etymology reflects the meaning of actions occurring at the same time.",

It can translate to \"at the same time as,\" \"the instant that,\" or \"as well as.\" The primary event (A) and the subsequent events (B, C, etc.) are all considered important. When connecting nouns or な-adjectives, 「である」is often omitted. While it literally means \"at the same time,\" it is commonly used to list multiple roles or functions.",
