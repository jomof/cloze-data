        "function": "Connects two events or states that occur concurrently.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes the precise simultaneity of events or the co-existence of characteristics. Can imply a cause-and-effect relationship for instantaneous events or simply list concurrent states.",
        "source": "Based on Bunpro and DOJG descriptions.",
        "colocation": "Often appears with verbs in dictionary form, nouns, or な-adjectives followed by である.",

    },
    "etymology": "「と同時に」 is composed of 「と」 (to), a particle indicating simultaneity or listing, 「同時」 (dōji), meaning \"same time,\" and 「に」 (ni), a particle marking a point in time or location. The etymology directly reflects the meaning of actions or states occurring at the same time or concurrently.",
    "writeup": "「と同時に」 is a versatile expression used to convey that two things happen either precisely at the same moment, or that they exist concurrently. It can be translated as \"at the same time as,\" \"the instant that,\" or \"as well as.\" This grammatical structure connects events or states, suggesting a strong temporal or conceptual link between them.\n\nWhen used to describe actions, 「と同時に」 implies that the second action occurs immediately following the first, or in perfect synchronicity with it. It emphasizes the lack of delay between the events, often making them feel interconnected.\n\nBeyond temporal simultaneity, 「と同時に」 is also commonly employed to describe someone or something possessing multiple roles, qualities, or functions at the same time. In this usage, it translates more accurately as \"as well as\" or \"and also,\" highlighting the co-existence of different attributes without diminishing the importance of any single one. For nouns and な-adjectives, the connecting 「である」 can sometimes be omitted in more casual contexts, though its inclusion adds a more formal or explanatory tone.",
