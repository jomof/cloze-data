        "nuance": "Implies that the added information (B) is substantial and strengthens the initial point (A), sometimes with a sense of culmination or reinforcement. It tends to be more objective and less used for personal, subjective opinions compared to other additive conjunctions. It can convey an unexpected additional fact or a worsening/improving situation."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「しかも」 originally comes from the combination of the archaic interjection 「然(しか)」 (shika), meaning \"as such\" or \"like that,\" and the particle 「も」 (mo), meaning \"too\" or \"also.\" This etymology reflects its function of adding more to what is already known, similar to English phrases like \"additionally.\" In modern writing, 「しかも」 may also occasionally appear with kanji as 「而も」 or 「併も」, although these forms are now quite rare.",
    "writeup": "「しかも」 is a conjunction in Japanese commonly translated as \"furthermore\" or \"moreover.\" It is a relatively formal grammar pattern used to indicate that both the preceding statement (A) and the following statement (B) exist simultaneously or are in unison. It emphasizes that (B) is an important or significant addition to (A), often strengthening the initial point or providing an unexpected piece of information.\n\nThis conjunction is typically used for objective statements or observable facts, rather than subjective personal opinions. As a conjunction, 「しかも」 can connect two phrases, or it can stand at the beginning of a second sentence, referring back to the first. Often, (A) is considered the 'base' information, while (B) provides additional details that build upon or further explain (A).\n\nConsider the context to understand the nuance: 「しかも」 can highlight an unexpectedly good or bad consequence, an added advantage, or a compounding negative factor. It signals to the listener that the second piece of information is noteworthy and adds weight to the overall situation described.",

If the addition is more unexpected or negative, 「おまけに」 might be more fitting. For general additions or to simply list more items, 「それに」 or 「その上」 are more neutral options. 「更に」 focuses on a greater degree or progression, while 「なお」 introduces supplementary, less central information.",
