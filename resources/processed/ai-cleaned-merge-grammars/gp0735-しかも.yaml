    "etymology": "The term 「しかも」 originally comes from the combination of the archaic interjection 「然(しか)」, meaning \"as such\" or \"like that,\" and the particle 「も」, meaning \"too\" or \"also.\"",
    "writeup": "「しかも」 is a conjunction in Japanese commonly translated as \"furthermore\" or \"moreover.\" It is a somewhat formal grammar pattern indicating that both A and B exist at the same time or are in unison. 「しかも」 focuses on the overall topic, used for objective opinions, such as observable facts, rather than personal opinions.\n\nAs a conjunction, 「しかも」 may be used between two phrases or at the beginning of a second sentence when referring back to the first. Often, A is the \"base\" information, while B is extra information added or further explaining A. \n\nIn modern writing, 「しかも」 may also appear as 「而も」 or 「併も」, although both are quite rare.",
