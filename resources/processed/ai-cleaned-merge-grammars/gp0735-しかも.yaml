        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",

        "usage-context": "Used to add further information that is often significant, surprising, or serves to reinforce the preceding statement. It typically applies to objective opinions or observable facts.",
        "function": "To connect two clauses or sentences, adding an extra layer of information or emphasis to the preceding statement.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the added information (B) is substantial and strengthens the initial point (A), sometimes with a sense of culmination or reinforcement. It tends to be more objective and less used for personal, subjective opinions compared to other additive conjunctions. It can convey an unexpected additional fact or a worsening/improving situation."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「しかも」 originally comes from the combination of the archaic interjection 「然(しか)」 (shika), meaning \"as such\" or \"like that,\" and the particle 「も」 (mo), meaning \"too\" or \"also.\" This etymology reflects its function of adding more to what is already known, similar to English phrases like \"additionally.\" In modern writing, 「しかも」 may also occasionally appear with kanji as 「而も」 or 「併も」, although these forms are now quite rare.",
    "writeup": "「しかも」 is a conjunction in Japanese commonly translated as \"furthermore\" or \"moreover.\" It is a relatively formal grammar pattern used to indicate that both the preceding statement (A) and the following statement (B) exist simultaneously or are in unison. It emphasizes that (B) is an important or significant addition to (A), often strengthening the initial point or providing an unexpected piece of information.\n\nThis conjunction is typically used for objective statements or observable facts, rather than subjective personal opinions. As a conjunction, 「しかも」 can connect two phrases, or it can stand at the beginning of a second sentence, referring back to the first. Often, (A) is considered the 'base' information, while (B) provides additional details that build upon or further explain (A).\n\nConsider the context to understand the nuance: 「しかも」 can highlight an unexpectedly good or bad consequence, an added advantage, or a compounding negative factor. It signals to the listener that the second piece of information is noteworthy and adds weight to the overall situation described.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "While both add information, 「おまけに」 often implies an unexpected addition, sometimes with a negative or exasperated connotation, like 'to top it all off.' 「しかも」 tends to offer a more related or logical extension of the initial statement, emphasizing its significance rather than its unexpectedness."

            "nuance": "「又〜も」 is a more formal and literary expression primarily meaning 'and also' or 'again.' It lacks the emphatic or reinforcing nuance of 「しかも」, which highlights the importance of the added information."

            "nuance": "「なお」 typically introduces supplementary information, a side note, or a related point, often in a more detached manner. In contrast, 「しかも」 adds more significant or impactful details that directly build on or reinforce the preceding statement."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「それに」 is a more general and versatile expression for adding information. While similar, 「しかも」 often carries a stronger emphasis on the importance or surprising nature of the additional point, making it more impactful than a simple 'and' or 'besides'."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「その上」 is a neutral way to add information, signifying 'on top of that.' 「しかも」 emphasizes the importance, surprising aspect, or compounding effect of the additional point, giving it more weight than a mere accumulation of facts."

            "nuance": "「更に」 indicates a greater degree, extent, or intensity of something already mentioned. It signifies 'even more' or 'furthermore' in terms of progression, whereas 「しかも」 adds a separate but related piece of information that reinforces the preceding statement."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To discern the correct usage among these similar expressions, consider the specific nuance you wish to convey. Use 「しかも」 when the added information significantly strengthens or reinforces the preceding statement, often with an objective or cumulative feel. If the addition is more unexpected or negative, 「おまけに」 might be more fitting. For general additions or to simply list more items, 「それに」 or 「その上」 are more neutral options. 「更に」 focuses on a greater degree or progression, while 「なお」 introduces supplementary, less central information.",
