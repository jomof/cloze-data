    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the conditional particle 「ば」 with the noun 「ほど」 (degree, extent). 「ば」 indicates a condition, and 「ほど」 signifies the degree to which something is true or occurs. Together, they express a proportional relationship: the more one condition is met, the greater the effect or outcome.",
    "writeup": "「ば〜ほど」 is used to express a proportional relationship, similar to \"the more... the more\" in English. It indicates that as one thing increases or intensifies, another thing increases or intensifies as a result. The structure involves repeating a verb or adjective, once in the conditional 「ば」 form and once in its dictionary or plain form. For nouns and な-adjectives, 「なら」 is used with the 「ば」 form. Sometimes the 「ば」 part is omitted, leaving 「ほど」 to imply the conditional relationship.",
