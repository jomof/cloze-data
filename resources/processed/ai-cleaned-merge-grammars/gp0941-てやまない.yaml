    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てやまない」 comes from the verb 「止 (や)む」, meaning \"to stop\" or \"to cease\". So, literally, 「てやまない」 means \"to not stop doing something\". It is a set phrase that conveys a strong, continuous emotion or desire.",
    "writeup": "「〜てやまない」 is a formal construction expressing a strong, continuous feeling or desire. It combines the te-form of a verb or the te-form of an い-adjective with the negative form of the u-verb 「止む」 'to cease'. The literal meaning is \"to not stop (A)\", which is often translated as \"to always (A)\" or \"to (A) from the bottom of one's heart\". This expression is used exclusively in relation to feelings and emotions. Common words that may be partnered with 「やまない」 include 「愛する」 'to love', 「敬愛する」 'to love and respect', 「願う」 'to wish for', 「祈る」 'to hope for', 「望む」 'to have ambitions for', 「期待する」 'to anticipate', 「尊敬する」 'to respect', and 「信じる」 'to trust'. Note that 「やまない」 emphasizes the continuation of something, so it is not used with temporary feelings like anger or disappointment.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene focuses on the enduring nature of affection for a pet, guiding the user to choose 「てやまない」 to emphasize the continuous, deep love rather than just a strong, temporary affection indicated by 「とても愛している」."
