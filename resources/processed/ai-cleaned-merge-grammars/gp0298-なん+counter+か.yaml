    "etymology": "「何 (nan)」 means \"what\" or \"how many\". 「か (ka)」 is a particle often used at the end of questions, but it can also express uncertainty or doubt. Together, they create a sense of \"some unknown quantity\" or \"what quantity, I wonder?\" when used with a counter.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「なん+counter+か」 in Japanese indicates an uncertain number of something, similar to \"some,\" \"several,\" or \"a few\" in English. It conveys the speaker's uncertainty about the precise quantity. It is important to note the distinction between 「なん」 and 「なに」; 「なん」 is almost always used when counting things, while 「なに」 is used to identify things.\n\nIn addition to 「なん」, 「いく」 (from the kanji 「幾」 meaning \"how many/much\") can also be used in this construction. While both are common, 「幾」 is more frequently found in set expressions like 「いくら」 (how much) and 「いくつ」 (how many/old), whereas 「なん」 is generally used for counting specific items, such as people.",
