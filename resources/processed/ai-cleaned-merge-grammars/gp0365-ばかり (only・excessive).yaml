  usage-context: General
etymology: The word ばかり is rarely written with kanji in modern Japanese, but its origin can be traced
  back to 許り (or sometimes 計る). The kanji 許り literally means "to permit" or "to allow through." This implies
  that only a specific thing is "permitted" or present in a given situation, leading to the modern meaning
  of exclusivity or limitation. This historical context illuminates how ばかり came to convey the nuance
  of "nothing but" or "only."
writeup: |-
  The particle **ばかり** primarily conveys the nuance of "nothing but," "only," or "always doing" a specific action or having a particular state. It emphasizes exclusivity or a predominant characteristic, often with a slightly negative or exasperated connotation.

  *   When attached to the **て-form of a verb** (e.g., Vてばかり), it indicates that someone is constantly, excessively, or exclusively engaged in that action. It is frequently followed by いる to denote a continuous state, though いる can be omitted in some contexts.
  *   When used after a **noun** (e.g., Nounばかり), it implies that something consists solely of that noun or that only that noun is present. This usage can also carry a critical tone, suggesting an excess or imbalance.
  *   It can also connect to a noun using の, forming 「NounばかりのNoun」, to describe something that is characterized exclusively by the first noun.

  While **ばかり** can be written with the kanji 許り, this is extremely rare in contemporary Japanese. It is almost always written in hiragana.

  - term: ばかりでなく
    meaning: Not only…but also, As well as
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike {ばかり}, which emphasizes exclusivity, ばかりでなく adds another item to the statement, signifying
      inclusivity rather than limitation. It means 'not only A, but also B'.
    grammar_point: ばかりでなく (not only... but also)
  - term: だけでなく
    meaning: Not only ~ but ~ also, Not just ~ but ~ also
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike {ばかり} which emphasizes exclusivity or excess, だけでなく is used to list multiple elements,
      indicating inclusivity and addition. It means 'not only X, but also Y'.
    grammar_point: だけでなく (not only... but also)
  - term: だけしか
    meaning: To emphasize '~only', Nothing but
    kind: synonym
    nuance: だけしか is similar to {ばかり} in that it emphasizes that only something is happening. However,
      だけしか is typically more emphatic and implies a stronger sense of limitation or restriction than {ばかり}.
      It always takes a negative verb.
    grammar_point: だけしか (stronger only)
  - term: だけ
    meaning: Only, Just
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar to {ばかり} in meaning, だけ does not necessarily imply criticism or dissatisfaction
      like {ばかり} often does. It is generally a neutral marker of limitation, simply stating 'only A,'
      without judgment on quantity or nature.
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: しか〜ない
    meaning: There's only, Nothing but
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Like だけしか, しか〜ない is similar to {ばかり} in that it emphasizes that only something is happening.
      However, しか〜ない requires a negative verb ending, meaning 'nothing but' or 'no more than' the specified
      item or action exists.
    grammar_point: しか〜ない (only・nothing but)
  - term: ばかりだ
    meaning: (Only) continue to, Keep on -ing, More and more
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: The grammar point Verb + ばかりだ (often Verb-plain + ばかりだ) means that something continues to
      happen or is in a state of escalation. By contrast, the main {ばかり} focuses on the exclusivity or
      predominance of the item or action, often with a critical nuance. For example, 「良くなるばかりだ」 means
      'it's only getting better'.
    grammar_point: ばかりだ (only continues to)
  - term: ばかりに
    meaning: Simply because, Only because, Just because, Simply on account of
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: '{ばかりに} indicates a reason or cause, specifically for a negative or unfortunate outcome. The
      main {ばかり}, on the other hand, describes something being the *only* thing or occurring excessively,
      typically without directly indicating a cause-and-effect relationship to a negative consequence.'
    grammar_point: ばかりに (simply because)
  - term: だらけ
    meaning: covered in, full of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While {ばかり} can imply an exclusive presence or excessive quantity, often with a critical nuance,
      {だらけ} specifically means 'covered in' or 'full of' undesirable things, emphasizing mess, dirt, or
      abundance of negative elements. {ばかり} can apply to actions (e.g., eating only), while {だらけ} applies
      to physical states (e.g., covered in dust).
    grammar_point: だらけ (covered in)
  - term: ずくめ
    meaning: completely, entirely, nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '{ずくめ} emphasizes ''nothing but'' in a more complete and often positive or neutral sense,
      typically used for abstract concepts like ''good things'' or ''black clothes''. {ばかり} can have a
      more critical or negative connotation and is more versatile in terms of what it modifies.'
    grammar_point: ずくめ (completely・entirely)
  - term: のみ
    meaning: only, just, nothing but
    kind: synonym
    nuance: のみ is a more formal and literary equivalent of だけ or {ばかり}, conveying exclusivity without
      the negative or excessive nuance often found in {ばかり}.
    grammar_point: のみ (only・just)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  While **ばかり** implies an exclusive focus or excessive degree, often carrying a negative or critical connotation (e.g., 「彼はゲームをしてばかりいる」 implies he plays too many games or does nothing but play games), other similar expressions have distinct nuances. In contrast, **だけ**, while also meaning 'only,' is generally neutral. For example, 「彼はゲームをするだけだ」 could simply mean that playing games is the only thing he does, without necessarily implying an excessive amount or negative judgment. Similarly, **しか〜ない** requires a negative verb ending, meaning 'nothing but' or 'no more than' the specified item or action exists, as in 「ジュースしか飲まない」 (I only drink juice, and nothing else). **だけしか** reinforces this restrictive nuance, providing an even stronger emphasis on exclusivity.

  On the other hand, **ばかりでなく** and **だけでなく〜も** are used to indicate 'not only... but also,' which is the opposite of the exclusivity conveyed by **ばかり**. **ばかりだ** (when combined with a plain verb) and **ばかりに** are distinct grammatical patterns: **ばかりだ** signifies a continuous or escalating state, while **ばかりに** indicates a cause or reason leading to an unfortunate outcome.

  **だらけ** and **ずくめ** also denote fullness or exclusivity but with different nuances. **だらけ** typically implies being 'covered in' or 'full of' undesirable physical elements (e.g., 「ごみだらけ」, full of trash), emphasizing mess or an overwhelming presence of negative things. **ずくめ** conveys 'nothing but' in a more complete and often positive or neutral sense, usually for abstract concepts (e.g., 「いいことずくめ」, nothing but good things). Lastly, **のみ** is a more formal and literary synonym for 'only' or 'just', conveying exclusivity without the critical or excessive implications often associated with ばかり.

  feeling to fully grasp its usage.
