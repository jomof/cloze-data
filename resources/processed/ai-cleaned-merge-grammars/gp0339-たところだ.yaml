    "etymology": "「ところ」 literally means \"place\" or \"situation.\" In this grammar point, it refers to the 'situation' immediately after an action has been completed, or the 'point' in time when an action was occurring.",
    "writeup": "「たところだ」 is used to express that an action or event has just finished. It signifies that something has **just** been completed. It's similar to saying \"just did (something).\" The 「ところ」 can sometimes be shortened to 「とこ」 in casual speech, particularly when referring to the state or situation.\n\nWhile 「たところだ」 indicates an action just completed, 「ていたところだ」 expresses that one **was just doing** something when an interruption occurred or a new situation arose. Be mindful that 「ところ」 can also mean a physical place, written as 「所」, but in this grammatical context, it refers to a temporal or situational 'point'.",
