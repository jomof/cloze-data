    "etymology": "「ところ」 literally means \"place\" or \"situation.\" In this grammar point, it refers to the 'situation' immediately after an action has been completed.",
    "writeup": "「たところだ」 is used to express that an action or event has just finished. It's similar to saying \"just did (something).\" The 「ところ」 can sometimes be shortened to 「とこ」 in casual speech. Be careful, because 「ところ」 can also mean a physical place written as 「所」, though in this case, it refers to a situation or point in time.",
