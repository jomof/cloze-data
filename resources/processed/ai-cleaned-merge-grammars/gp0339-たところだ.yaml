    "etymology": "「ところ」 literally means 'place' or 'situation'. In this grammar point, it refers to the situation immediately after an action has been completed.",
    "writeup": "「たところだ」 is used to express that something has just been completed. It's similar to saying \"just finished doing\" something. 「ところ」 itself can mean 'place' or 'situation,' but in this context, it signifies the immediate aftermath of an action. In casual speech, 「ところ」 is sometimes shortened to 「とこ」. Be mindful that while 所 can be written in kanji, it is often written in hiragana, especially when referring to a situation rather than a physical location. 「ていたところ」 can be used to express that you \"were just doing\" something when an interruption occurred.",
