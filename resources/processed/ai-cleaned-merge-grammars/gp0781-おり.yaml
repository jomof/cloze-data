    "writeup": "\"Ori\" (おり) is an auxiliary verb used to indicate a state or situation that results from a preceding action. It is primarily used in formal writing and speech.\n\n*   It connects to the te-form of verbs (Vて + おり). For instance, 「知っています」 (shitte imasu) becomes 「知っております」 (shitte orimasu).\n*   It carries the nuance of \"being in a state, and as a result...\" or \"because of being..., therefore...\".\n*   Because it is a humble expression (謙譲語), it is used to show respect to the listener or reader.",
