        "Register": "Formal; written language",
        "Usage": "Used as an auxiliary verb. It's the written/formal equivalent of 「いる」.",
        "Function": "Connects two clauses, often implying a reason or state that leads to the second clause.",

    "etymology": "「おり」 is the humble form of 「いる」. It originally indicated the existence or location of someone/something. In modern usage as a grammar point, it often functions as a formal or literary substitute for 「いる」 or 「いる」's te-form 「いて」, adding a layer of politeness or objectivity to the statement.",
    "writeup": "「おり」 is an auxiliary verb mainly used in formal writing or speech. It's essentially the more formal counterpart of 「いる」. Think of it as a way to connect two clauses while providing a reason, explanation, or description of a state. It's frequently seen in official documents, news articles, and business correspondence. Though it originates from humble speech, it doesn't necessarily imply humility when used this way; rather, it creates a sense of distance and objectivity.",
