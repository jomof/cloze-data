    "writeup": "「おり」 is an auxiliary verb used to indicate a state or condition that results from a previous action. It's primarily used in **formal writing and speech**. It's essentially a more polite/formal version of the auxiliary verb 「いる」.\n\n*   It connects to the te-form of a verb (Vて + おり). For example, 「知っています」 becomes 「知っており」.\n*   The nuance is similar to \"...and as a result, the state is...\" or \"...and so it is that...\"\n*   As it is humble language, it is used to show respect towards the listener or reader.",
