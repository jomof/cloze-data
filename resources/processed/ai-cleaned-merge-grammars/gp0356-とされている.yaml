    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「する」 (to do), in its passive form 「される」, combined with the particle 「と」. 「と」 here indicates that something is *being said*, *thought*, or *considered* in a particular way. Thus, 「とされている」 literally translates to \"is being done as,\" but carries the nuance of something being widely accepted or considered.",
    "writeup": "「とされている」 expresses that something is widely believed, regarded, or considered to be a certain way. It's similar to saying \"it is said that...\" or \"it is considered that...\". This grammar point is useful for describing generally accepted facts, beliefs, or common knowledge.\n\n*   It emphasizes a broad consensus rather than a personal opinion.\n*   It is often found in academic writing, news reports, and formal speech.",

            "setting": "storytelling",
            "conjugation": "dictionary (plain non-past)",
            "etymology": "「うさぎ」 means rabbit, and is related to the Rabbit in the Chinese Zodiac. Japanese folktales often describe seeing a rabbit pounding mochi on the moon.",
            "nuance": "The sentence 「昔々、月にはうさぎがいるとされている」 uses 「とされている」to convey a widely held belief or legend passed down through generations, rather than a personal opinion."

            "speaker_gender": "male",
            "conjugation": "dictionary (plain non-past)",
            "nuance": "The sentence 「この会社では、女性は三十歳までだとされている」 uses 「とされている」 to express a prevalent, but likely sexist, view within the company about the value of women up to a certain age. The 「だと」 emphasizes the declarative nature of this belief.",
            "etymology": "「会社」 means company. Note the inherent cultural assumption that employees work at a company until retirement, rather than moving between companies for better pay."

            "etymology": "「体に良い」 literally translates to good for the body. Note the direct way that Japanese conveys health information.",
            "nuance": "The sentence 「最近、コーヒーは体に良いとされています」 uses the polite form 「とされています」 to convey information in a formal and respectful manner, which is typical when discussing widely accepted beliefs or general information, such as the health benefits of coffee."

            "nuance": "The sentence 「論文によると、嘘をつくと顔に出るとされていた」 uses the past tense 「とされていた」 because it's referencing a belief from a paper in the past, implying that the idea may not be current or accurate. The phrasing sets a formal, academic tone, fitting for referencing a research paper."

            "etymology": "「感動的」 means moving or touching.",
            "nuance": "The sentence 「その映画は、感動的だとされています」 uses 「とされています」 to express that the movie's emotional impact is generally agreed upon. This lends credibility to the speaker's recommendation, as it's not just their personal opinion."

            "etymology": "「戦場」 means battlefield, and 「そうだ」 indicates hearsay or information from an unspecified source."

Using the polite form adds a level of deference, making it suitable for speaking with acquaintances or in more formal settings.",
            "etymology": "「美味しい」 means delicious, and is often written in hiragana to convey a more casual or friendly tone."
