    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「する」 (to do), in its passive form 「される」, combined with the particle 「と」. 「と」 here indicates that something is *being said*, *thought*, or *considered* in a particular way. Thus, 「とされている」 literally translates to \"is being done as,\" but carries the nuance of something being widely accepted or considered.",
    "writeup": "「とされている」 expresses that something is widely believed, regarded, or considered to be a certain way. It's similar to saying \"it is said that...\" or \"it is considered that...\". This grammar point is useful for describing generally accepted facts, beliefs, or common knowledge.\n\n*   It emphasizes a broad consensus rather than a personal opinion.\n*   It is often found in academic writing, news reports, and formal speech.",
