    "writeup": "「Verb[volitional-よう] + ようと思う」 is used to express the speaker's intention, plan, or decision to do something. It is similar to 「つもりです」, but 「ようと思う」 often implies a more spontaneous or less firm intention. The volitional form (よう) is created differently depending on the verb type. For ru-verbs, drop the る and add よう. For u-verbs, change the final vowel to the 'o' sound and add う.  For example, 「食べようと思う」 (I think I will eat). Also, you can use 「Verb[dictionary form] + まいと思う」 to express the speaker's intention not to do something. This structure is useful for expressing resolutions or decisions to abstain from certain actions.  For example, 「もうお酒を飲むまいと思う」 (I think I will not drink alcohol anymore). **Important consideration:** When referring to someone else's intentions, use 「思っている」 instead of 「思う」.",
