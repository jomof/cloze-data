    "etymology": "The etymology of 「だらけ」 is uncertain, but it is thought to be related to the verb 「垂れる(tareru)」, meaning 'to hang down' or 'to drip'. The image is that something is so full of something else that it's overflowing or dripping with it. The origin of the word 「垂れる(tareru)」 is the verb 「垂る(taru)」 which is the pre-modern form.",
    "writeup": "「だらけ」 is a suffix in Japanese that indicates something is completely covered in or full of something else, typically something undesirable. It attaches directly to nouns. It often, but not always, takes the particle 「の」 before another noun. The second noun is often omitted if it's obvious what is being referred to.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「だらけ」 is often used when things are in a 'scattered' state. Therefore, it might sound unnatural to describe something covered evenly in something.",
