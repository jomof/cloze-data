    "etymology": "「だらけ」 likely comes from the verb 「だらける」, meaning to be lazy or sloppy. The connection is that something 「だらけ」 is often seen as being in a messy or undesirable state, implying a lack of care or attention.",
    "writeup": "「だらけ」 is a suffix used to express that something is \"covered in\" or \"full of\" something else. It attaches directly to nouns. Often, it implies that the thing it's covered in is undesirable or excessive.\n\n*   When 「だらけ」 is followed by the particle 「の」, it modifies another noun. For example, 「ゴミだらけの部屋」 (a room full of garbage).\n*   The noun after 「の」 can be omitted if the context is clear.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「だらけ」 is often used to describe things scattered or spread out. Thus, it may sound unnatural to describe something covered uniformly unless that scattered quality is implied.\n*   It carries a negative connotation. Thus, you would not use 「だらけ」 to describe something covered with something desirable.",
