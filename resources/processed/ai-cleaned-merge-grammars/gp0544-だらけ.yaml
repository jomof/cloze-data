    "etymology": "「だらけ」 likely stems from the verb 「だらける」, which means to be lazy or sloppy. This connection suggests that a state of being 「だらけ」 implies a messy, undesirable condition, often due to a lack of care or attention.",
    "writeup": "「だらけ」 is a suffix used to express that something is \"covered in\" or \"full of\" something else. It directly attaches to nouns. Most often, it implies that the substance or item it is covered in is undesirable, negative, or present in an excessive amount.When 「だらけ」 is followed by the particle 「の」, it modifies another noun. For instance, 「ゴミだらけの部屋」 (a room full of garbage).The noun following 「の」 can be omitted if the context is clear.Important Considerations「だらけ」 is typically used to describe things that are scattered or spread out. Therefore, it might sound unnatural when used to describe something uniformly covered, unless that scattered quality is inherently implied (e.g., small holes or scratches). For example, to say a wall is 「ペンキだらけ」 (covered in paint) would imply scattered drops or smudges, not a smooth, even coat.It generally carries a negative connotation, indicating an undesirable state. Consequently, it is usually not used to describe something covered with a desirable substance, unless the speaker deliberately intends to convey an *overwhelming* or *excessive* amount, even if generally positive, to achieve a specific nuanced effect.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「だらけ」, 「にほかならない」 is used to emphasize the essence or true nature of something, rather than indicating it's covered in something. It's a statement of identity or conclusion."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「だらけ」, 「しか〜ない」 indicates a limitation or restriction, meaning 'only' or 'nothing but' a certain quantity or option. It focuses on scarcity rather than pervasive presence."

        {
            "term": "まみれ",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「まみれ」 is very similar to 「だらけ」, but it often implies a more intense or thorough covering, like being drenched or smeared. 「まみれ」 can be used for states that can be positive (e.g., 汗まみれ - soaked in sweat from hard work) as well as negative, while 「だらけ」 is generally reserved for negative or undesirable conditions and implies scattered distribution rather than complete saturation."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "「にほかならない」 and 「しか〜ない」 express limitations or definitions, while 「だらけ」 indicates an abundance or being covered in something. 「まみれ」 and 「だらけ」 are both similar, but use 「まみれ」 for substances that *smear* or *soak* and can imply both positive and negative states. Use 「だらけ」 primarily for negative or undesirable conditions, often suggesting a *scattered* abundance rather than a uniform coating.",
