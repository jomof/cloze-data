etymology: The modern Japanese verb 「行く」 (iku) has its roots in Old Japanese 「ゆく」 (yuku). Over time, the
  pronunciation shifted from the y sound to i when followed by u or o in certain contexts, which is a
  common phonetic change in Japanese. While both 「行く」 (iku) and 「逝く」 (yuku) use the same kanji, 「逝く」 specifically
  means "to pass away" or "to die," retaining the older pronunciation for a more somber context, highlighting
  the finality of a journey. This distinction in pronunciation for different nuances, despite sharing
  the same kanji, showcases how the language has evolved to convey subtle differences in meaning and formality.
writeup: 「行く」 is a fundamental Japanese verb meaning "to go." It describes movement away from the speaker's
  current location or a designated point of reference. It is used broadly for physical travel, but also
  extends to abstract concepts like time passing or processes continuing. The choice between 「行く」 and
  its counterpart 「来る (kuru)」 (to come) is entirely dependent on the speaker's perspective. If the movement
  is away from the speaker, you use 「行く」. If the movement is towards the speaker, you use 「来る」. This distinction
  is crucial and a common point of confusion for English speakers, as English "go" can sometimes be used
  in contexts where Japanese would use "come." When specifying the destination, the particle 「へ」 (e) or
  「に」 (ni) is typically used. 「へ」 emphasizes the direction of movement, while 「に」 emphasizes the arrival
  at a specific destination. Both are often interchangeable in simple contexts. When specifying the means
  of transport, the particle 「で」 (de) is used. 「行く」 can also be used in various compound verbs and set
  phrases, indicating progression or continuation. For instance, 「〜ていく」 denotes a change that proceeds
  away from the present point in time or space, or a gradual change into the future.

  - term: 来る
    meaning: to come
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「来る」 indicates movement towards the speaker or a point of reference. Unlike 「行く」, which means
      movement away.
    grammar_point: くる (come)
  - term: 帰る
    meaning: to return; to go home
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「行く」 is general "to go", 「帰る」 specifically means "to return" or "to go home". It implies
      returning to a familiar place, often one's residence.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:帰る (to return; to go home)
  - term: 向かう
    meaning: to head toward; to face
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「向かう」 focuses on the direction or orientation towards something, often implying the start
      of a journey or facing a certain direction. While similar to 「行く」 in conveying direction, 「向かう」
      doesn't necessarily imply reaching the destination, but rather the act of heading there. 「行く」 focuses
      on the act of going and reaching.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:向かう (to head toward; to face)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the subtle distinctions between 「行く」, 「来る」, 「帰る」, and 「向かう」
  is key to natural Japanese. 「行く」 describes general movement away from the speaker. Its direct opposite
  is 「来る」, which describes movement towards the speaker. 「帰る」 is a specific type of 「行く」 or 「来る」, always
  involving a return to a home or familiar base. 「向かう」 describes the act of heading in a direction, focusing
  more on the orientation or initial part of the journey rather than the completion of going. For example,
  you might 「駅 に {向かって} いる」 (are heading towards the station), and once you are on your way to the station,
  you are 「駅 に {行く}」 (going to the station).

  the action.
