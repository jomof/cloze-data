    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 originally indicated location or direction. Over time, it evolved to express purpose when combined with motion verbs, signifying the destination or goal of the action.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」, when attached to the ます-stem of a verb, indicates the **purpose** for which a movement is undertaken. It is akin to saying \"in order to\" or \"for the purpose of\" doing something in English. This usage is strictly limited to **verbs of motion**—verbs that express movement from one place to another.\n\nCommon motion verbs include:\n*   行く (いく - to go)\n*   来る (くる - to come)\n*   帰る (かえる - to return)\n*   入る (はいる - to enter)\n*   出る (でる - to leave)\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish these from verbs that describe the *manner* of movement, such as 歩く (あるく - to walk), 走る (はしる - to run), or 泳ぐ (およぐ - to swim). While you might say 「公園に泳ぎに行く」 (I'm going to the park to swim) because 泳ぎに行く combines the purpose (swimming) with the motion (going), you would not use 「に」 alone to express the purpose with verbs of manner. For instance, 「公園に泳ぐ」 would be grammatically incorrect if attempting to express purpose. The particle 「に」 specifies *what* you are going, coming, or returning *for*.",

While women can also use 「参ります」, it is stereotypically more associated with male business speech patterns. However, the direct link of the purpose (打ち合わせ) with the motion verb (参る) through 「に」 is gender neutral. "
