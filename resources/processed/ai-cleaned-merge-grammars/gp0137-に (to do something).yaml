    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 originally indicated location or direction. Over time, it evolved to express purpose when combined with motion verbs, signifying the destination or goal of the action.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「に」, when attached to the ます-stem of a verb, indicates the **purpose** for which a movement is undertaken. It is akin to saying \"in order to\" or \"for the purpose of\" doing something in English. This usage is strictly limited to **verbs of motion**—verbs that express movement from one place to another.\n\nCommon motion verbs include:\n*   行く (いく - to go)\n*   来る (くる - to come)\n*   帰る (かえる - to return)\n*   入る (はいる - to enter)\n*   出る (でる - to leave)\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish these from verbs that describe the *manner* of movement, such as 歩く (あるく - to walk), 走る (はしる - to run), or 泳ぐ (およぐ - to swim). While you might say 「公園に泳ぎに行く」 (I'm going to the park to swim) because 泳ぎに行く combines the purpose (swimming) with the motion (going), you would not use 「に」 alone to express the purpose with verbs of manner. For instance, 「公園に泳ぐ」 would be grammatically incorrect if attempting to express purpose. The particle 「に」 specifies *what* you are going, coming, or returning *for*.",

            "term": "ために",
            "meaning": "For the sake of; in order to",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both 「に」 and 「ために」 express purpose, 「ために」 is used with nouns or verbs in the dictionary form, and it often implies a stronger sense of dedication, benefit, or a more deliberate, abstract goal. 「に」 implies a direct purpose for the immediate movement."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Be mindful that 「に」 is specifically used with the ます-stem of verbs of motion, indicating the immediate purpose of the action. 「ために」 has broader usage and can express purpose in a more general sense, including benefiting people or goals, or a more abstract 'reason for'. 「に」 is generally more concise and direct for expressing the purpose of movement.",

            "nuance": "The use of the polite form 「行きました」 fits the informative and polite register, suitable for recounting daily errands. Both 「へ」 and 「に」 are natural for indicating direction here. Using the noun 「買い物」 directly with 「に」 is also common and natural for expressing the purpose of shopping.",
            "etymology": "The use of 「買い物 に 行きました」 is an example where a noun acts as the purpose. 「買い物」 (shopping) is a noun derived from the verb 「買い物する」 (to do shopping). This reflects the particle 「に」's older usage to indicate destination or goal, which naturally extends to the goal of an action."

            "etymology": "The particle 「ぜ」 originates from a combination of the declarative particle 「ぞ」 and the emphatic particle 「え」, evolving to convey a strong, often masculine, assertion or suggestion."

            "etymology": "The particle 「ね」 is thought to have evolved from the emphatic particle 「な」 and the interjection 「え」, leading to its current function of seeking confirmation or agreement, or expressing empathy."

The use of 「買い物 に」 directly with the noun highlights a common idiomatic expression for purpose with motion verbs, implying 「買い物 を する ため に」 without explicitly stating the verb.

    "post_example_writeup": "The grammar point 「Vますに」 specifically attaches 「に」 to the ます-stem of a verb (e.g., 食べます → 食べに, 読みます → 読みに). While some nouns, particularly those derived from verbs (like 買い物 'shopping' from 買い物する 'to shop', or 散歩 'walk' from 散歩する 'to walk'), can appear with 「に」 followed by a motion verb (e.g., 買い物に行く, 散歩に行く), this is generally understood as the noun itself acting as the purpose, or as an implied `~しに` for suru-verbs. The core of this grammar point focuses on the direct attachment to the ます-stem of a verb.",
