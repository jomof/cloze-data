    "details": {
        "Function": "Indicates the purpose of movement verbs like 行く (iku - to go), 来る (kuru - to come), 帰る (kaeru - to return).",
        "Limitations": "Can only be used with verbs of motion.",
        "Nuance": "Expresses a clear intention or goal for the movement."
    },
    "formation": {
        "Verb [ます stem] + に + Motion Verb": "Indicates the purpose of going, coming, or returning, e.g., 話しに (to talk), 食べに (to eat)."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「に」 originally indicated location or direction. Over time, it evolved to express purpose when combined with motion verbs, signifying the destination or goal of the action.",
    "writeup": "The 「に」 particle, when used with motion verbs, indicates the **purpose** of the movement. It's similar to saying \"in order to\" or \"for the purpose of\" doing something. Only verbs that express movement from one place to another (like 行く 'to go', 来る 'to come', 帰る 'to return') can be used with this grammar point. Verbs such as 歩く 'to walk', 走る 'to run', and 泳ぐ 'to swim' are generally not considered 'motion verbs' in this specific grammatical context, as they describe the *manner* of movement rather than movement *to* or *from* a place. Therefore, 「公園に泳ぎに行く」 (I'm going to the park to swim) is grammatically correct because 泳ぎに行く combines the purpose of swimming with the motion of going. However, 「公園に泳ぐ」 would be incorrect for expressing purpose.",

            "nuance": "The use of 「～ます」 makes the sentence polite, suitable for informing or discussing plans with a child in a polite family setting. 「遊びに行く」 is a very common and natural way to express the purpose of going somewhere to play.",
            "etymology": "「遊ぶ」, 'asobu' in dictionary form, means 'to play'."

            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "The use of 「～ました」 indicates a past action in a polite manner, appropriate for a formal introduction. The combination of 「勉強しに」 and 「来ました」 clearly states the purpose of coming to Japan. While 「勉強に」 is sometimes heard, 「勉強しに」 is more accurate as it derives from the verb 「勉強する」 (to study).",
            "etymology": "「勉強」 comes from 「勉」 (effort) and 「強」 (strong), thus meaning 'to make an effort strongly.'"
