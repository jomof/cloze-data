jlpt: N3
etymology: The term 「以上」 (いじょう) literally combines 「以」 (i), meaning 'by means of' or 'from,' and 「上」 (jō),
  meaning 'above' or 'more.' In this context, it has evolved from meaning 'what is above/beyond this point'
  to 'what has been presented up to this point and no more,' thus concluding a statement. The copulas
  だ and です are attached to denote casual and polite registers respectively.
writeup: The phrase 「以上だ」 or 「以上です」 is a straightforward and common way to conclude a statement, presentation,
  or list in Japanese. It directly translates to 'that is all' or 'that is the end.' This expression is
  versatile and can be attached to various forms, including plain sentences, clauses, or nouns, to indicate
  completeness and finality. It effectively signals to the listener or reader that the speaker or writer
  has finished conveying the intended information and there will be no further points on that specific
  topic. The choice between 「以上だ」 and 「以上です」 depends on the level of politeness required for the situation.
  「以上です」 is polite and suitable for formal settings such as business meetings, academic presentations,
  or official announcements. 「以上だ」 is the casual equivalent, often used among friends, family, or in informal
  written contexts. It is important to note that while 「以上だ・以上です」 indicates completion, it does not necessarily
  convey a sense of 'nothing more is needed' or 'nothing more can be done' which other expressions might
  imply. It is simply a factual declaration of finality for the current discourse.

    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「それだけだ・それだけです」 emphasizes the limited quantity or scope of something, implying there isn't
      anything *more* of a particular item or category. In contrast, 「以上だ・以上です」 marks the completion of
      a statement, presentation, or list, signifying that no further information will be provided *on
      that topic*.

  - term: 終わりだ・終わりです
    meaning: It's the end; finished
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「終わりだ・終わりです」 typically refers to the literal or conceptual end of an event, task, or period.
      For example, a meeting ending or a game finishing. 「以上だ・以上です」, while also signifying an end, specifically
      applies to the completion of verbal or written discourse, indicating that there are no more points
      to be made.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:終わりだ (it's the end)
  - term: これで終わりだ・これで終わりです
    meaning: This is the end; It finishes with this
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「終わりだ・終わりです」, but with an explicit reference to 'this' as the final point or action.
      It often carries a stronger sense of finality or termination for a specific sequence of events or
      actions. 「以上だ・以上です」 is more about the speaker's statement being complete.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:これで終わりだ (this is the end)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「以上だ・以上です」, 「それだけだ・それだけです」, and 「終わりだ・終わりです」 all convey a sense of conclusion,
  their specific applications differ. 「以上だ・以上です」 is formal and often used to signal the end of a formal
  discourse, such as a presentation or a list of items. It tells the audience, 'I have presented all the
  information I intended to.' 「それだけだ・それだけです」 is used to emphasize that *only* a specific thing or amount
  exists, implying a limitation. For instance, 'I only have this much money, and that's it.' 「終わりだ・終わりです」
  directly states that an event, task, or period has concluded, such as 'The movie is over.' Understanding
  these nuances helps in choosing the most appropriate expression for your context.
