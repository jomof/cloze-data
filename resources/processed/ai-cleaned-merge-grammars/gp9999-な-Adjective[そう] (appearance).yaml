pronunciation:
  katakana: ナ・アドジェクティブ・ソウ
  romaji: na-adjective-sou
formation:
  な-Adjective stem + そうだ/そうです: Indicates that a na-adjective quality appears to be true based on observation.
  な-Adjective stem + そうに + Verb: Modifies a verb, describing how the action is performed with an apparent
    quality (e.g., quietly-looking).
jlpt: N4
etymology: The そう (sou) in this construction, like the one for verbs and i-adjectives, comes from the
  classical Japanese verb 然る (saru) meaning "to be so" or "to appear". It evolved to attach to various
  word types to indicate appearance or conjecture. The そう here functions as a quasi-adjective, describing
  how something 'is' or 'seems to be'. Its use across different word types (verbs, i-adjectives, na-adjectives)
  reflects its core meaning of conveying an observed state or likelihood.
writeup: な-Adjective[そう] (appearance) is used to express that something "appears to be" or "looks like"
  a certain quality, based on direct visual or sensory observation. It attaches to the stem of な-adjectives.
  This grammatical construction allows speakers to convey an immediate impression about a person, object,
  or situation.Unlike そうだ used with verbs or i-adjectives, which often implies a direct visual cue (e.g.,
  雨が降りそうだ - "It looks like rain"), the そう attached to な-adjectives describes the quality itself as it
  appears. For instance, 「静か」 (shizuka - quiet) becomes 「静かそう」 (shizukasou - looks quiet).This form acts
  like an i-adjective itself, meaning it can be conjugated further. For example, to make it negative,
  you would say 「静かそうじゃない」 (shizukasou janai - doesn't look quiet), or to use it in the past tense, 「静かそうだった」
  (shizukasou datta - looked quiet).It's important to differentiate this そう from other similar-sounding
  grammatical patterns. The key here is the direct, observable impression of a characteristic. This form
  is common in everyday conversations to describe immediate perceptions.
false_friends:
  - term: い-Adjective[そう] (appearance)
    meaning: Appears to be; looks like; seems (based on direct observation) for i-adjectives
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express appearance based on observation, な-Adjective[そう] attaches to the stem of
      な-adjectives (e.g., 賑やかそう - looks lively), whereas い-Adjective[そう] attaches to the stem of い-adjectives
      (dropping the final い) (e.g., 楽しそう - looks fun).
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[そう] (appearance)
  - term: '[Verb-stem]そうだ (it seems・looks like)'
    meaning: It looks like; it seems that (something is about to happen or is in a certain state)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This そうだ attaches to the stem of a verb and suggests a likelihood or an impending event based
      on observation (e.g., 雨が降りそうだ - "It looks like it will rain"). In contrast, な-Adjective[そう] describes
      the apparent quality of something.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-stem]そうだ (it seems・looks like)
  - term: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
    meaning: It seems; it looks like; as if (conjecture based on broader information or comparison)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both そう and ようだ/みたいだ convey appearance, but そう often implies a direct, visual impression,
      while ようだ/みたいだ can be more speculative, based on less direct evidence, or used for comparison (e.g.,
      彼は日本人みたいだ - "He looks like a Japanese person").
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
  - term: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
    meaning: It seems that; I hear that; apparently (based on external evidence or hearsay)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: らしい conveys an impression based on indirect evidence or what one has heard (e.g., 彼はお金持ちらしい
      - "Apparently, he's rich"). な-Adjective[そう] is based on direct sensory input about a quality.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
post_false_friends_writeup: When expressing appearance in Japanese, it's crucial to consider the type
  of word being modified and the source of your impression. While な-Adjective[そう] conveys a direct visual
  assessment of a quality, い-Adjective[そう] does the same for i-adjectives. The そう attached to verbs, however,
  refers to the likelihood of an action or state. For more generalized conjecture, or when making comparisons,
  ようだ or みたいだ are often used. Finally, if your impression is based on hearsay or indirect evidence, らしい
  is the appropriate choice. Paying attention to these distinctions will help you choose the correct expression.
examples:
  - english: That design looks simple.
    japanese:
      - その デザイン は {簡単 そう} です ね。
      - その デザイン は {簡単 そう} だ ね。
    english_literally: That design is {simple-appearing}, isn't it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その デザイン は 綺麗 です ね。
        english: That design is pretty, isn't it?
        hint: This sentence directly states the design's quality. We're looking for a form to express
          appearance based on observation, for a な-adjective like 簡単 (simple).
      - competing_japanese:
          - その デザイン は 簡単 な よう です ね。
        english: That design seems simple, doesn't it?
        hint: 「ようです」 is used for conjecture or comparison, while 「そう」 emphasizes a direct visual impression.
          We're looking for a direct observational statement based on how it looks.
    scene: A designer is showing a new product concept to a colleague.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The speaker is making a direct observation about the design's perceived simplicity. The 「ね」
      softens the statement, inviting agreement. The use of 「簡単そう」 indicates an impression formed from
      looking at the design, implying ease of understanding or use rather than inherent simplicity. The
      formal です makes the observation polite in a professional context.
  - english: This room looks quiet and comfortable.
    japanese:
      - この 部屋 は {静か そう} で {快適 そう} です ね。
      - この 部屋 は {静か そう} で {快適 そう} だ ね。

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 部屋 は 静か で 快適 です ね。
        english: This room is quiet and comfortable, isn't it?
        hint: This directly states the room's qualities. We need a phrase that conveys a visual or sensory
          impression of those qualities, using the 'looks like' form for な-adjectives 静か and 快適.
    scene: A real estate agent showing a potential apartment to a client.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of 「静かそう」 and 「快適そう」 highlights the immediate sensory impression of the room's qualities
      based on observation (e.g., lack of noise, spaciousness, decor). The 「で」 connects the two apparent
      qualities as a conjunctive te-form for adjectives, and 「ね」 softens the statement while seeking agreement
      in a polite, professional tone.
  - english: He seems kind, doesn't he?
    japanese:
      - 彼 は {親切 そう} です ね。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 親切 らしい です ね。
        english: Apparently, he is kind, isn't he?
        hint: 「らしい」 suggests the impression is based on indirect evidence or what's generally known. We're
          looking for an impression based on direct observation of his demeanor, not hearsay.
    scene: Two female friends observing a new colleague from a distance.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The female speaker uses 「ね」 to seek agreement on their impression of the person's kindness,
      which is derived from observing his actions or demeanor. 「親切そう」 indicates that his kindness is visibly
      apparent or strongly suggested by his appearance or behavior. The です ね makes it a polite but casual
      inquiry.

          - この 作業 は 簡単 です から、早く 終わら せよう。
        english: This task is easy, so let's finish it quickly.

    register: casual
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The speaker (team leader) is assessing the task's ease based on its apparent nature or description.

      visual cues from a distance. The plain form 「だ」 is typical for casual male speech, making the observation
      sound direct and informal.

          - この カバン は とても 丈夫 です。
        english: This bag is very durable.

          impression of durability, implying it 'looks' durable rather than being a confirmed fact.
    scene: A person examining a bag in a store.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang

          to be anxious, based on observation of her demeanor.
    scene: A colleague observing another before a big presentation.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「不安そうに 見える」 means "looks anxiously" or "appears to be anxious". 「不安」 is a な-adjective, and

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The phrase 「健康そうに 見える」 indicates that the speaker observes signs of good health in the person's

      and the casual tone suggests a relaxed conversation between friends.

        english: That problem is complex, but in reality it might be simple.
        hint: This directly states the problem's complexity as a fact. We need a form that expresses an
          initial impression or appearance of complexity, using the 'looks like' form.
    scene: Colleagues discussing a difficult problem at work.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The speaker acknowledges the initial impression of complexity 「複雑そう」 based on how the problem
      is presented or understood at first glance, but then offers a contrasting possibility, indicating
      careful consideration. The use of です makes the observation polite and suitable for a professional
      environment.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, な-Adjective[そう] is highly versatile for describing appearances.
  It can be used directly as a predicate (e.g., 賑やかそう だ) or adverbially with 見える (mieru - to appear) (e.g.,
  不安そうに 見える). The context of the sentence, including the presence of particles like に or auxiliary verbs
  like 見える, clarifies its role in conveying observations.
