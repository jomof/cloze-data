id: gp9999
meaning: What kind of; how; in what state or manner.
pronunciation:
  katakana: イカナ
  romaji: ikana
formation:
  如何な + Noun: Used to inquire about the type, nature, or state of a noun. (e.g., 如何な状況 - what kind of
    situation)
  如何に + Verb/い-Adjective/な-Adjective (adverbial form): Used to inquire about the manner or degree of an
    action or state. (e.g., 如何に難しい - how difficult)
jlpt: N1
etymology: The word 如何 (いか) originates from earlier forms like いかに (how, in what way), which itself is
  related to いかにも (indeed, truly). The 'な' functions as the attributive particle characteristic of な-adjectives,
  allowing it to directly modify nouns, similar to how どんな functions. The underlying meaning of 'how'
  or 'in what manner' is preserved, evolving to ask 'what kind of' by inquiring into the nature of something.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「如何な」 (ikana) is a formal expression used to inquire about the nature, state, or condition of something, functioning similarly to a な-adjective. It often carries a more serious, rhetorical, or evaluative nuance compared to its more common counterpart, 「どんな」 (donna).

  When directly modifying a noun, 「如何な」 asks "what kind of (Noun)?" or "what sort of (Noun)?" It delves into the specific characteristics or circumstances of the noun. For instance, you might use it to ask about the nature of a situation, a decision, or a feeling.

  It can also appear in an adverbial form as 「如何に」 (ikani) before verbs or adjectives, meaning "how" or "to what extent." In this usage, it emphasizes the degree or manner of an action or state, often implying a profound or significant level.

  Due to its formal register, 「如何な」 is more commonly encountered in written language, formal speeches, or when expressing a deep, thoughtful inquiry. It's less common in everyday casual conversation, where 「どんな」 or 「どういう」 would be preferred.
false_friends:
  - term: どんな (what kind of)
    meaning: What kind of; what sort of.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どんな」 is a general, common, and less formal way to ask 'what kind of'. It's suitable for everyday
      conversation and lacks the formal or rhetorical depth of 「如何な」.
    grammar_point: どんな (what kind of)
  - term: いかなる (whatever kind of)
    meaning: Any kind of; whatever kind of; no matter what kind of.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いかなる」 is even more formal and often implies an exhaustive or universal sense of 'any' or
      'whatever kind of'. It often appears in legal documents or highly formal statements, and unlike
      「如何な」, it does not typically ask a question but rather makes a comprehensive statement.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:いかなる (whatever kind of)
  - term: どういう (what kind of)
    meaning: What kind of; what sort of (asking for explanation or description).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どういう」 is similar to 「どんな」 but often implies a request for a more detailed explanation or
      description of the 'kind' or 'way' something is. It's generally more conversational than 「如何な」 and
      focuses on a descriptive answer.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どういう (what kind of)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「如何な」, 「どんな」, 「いかなる」, and 「どういう」 can all translate to 'what kind of'
  or 'how' in English, their usage contexts and nuances differ significantly. 「如何な」 is formal and often
  rhetorical, probing deeper into the nature of things. 「どんな」 is the most common and neutral. 「いかなる」 is
  extremely formal and often exhaustive, meaning 'any/whatever kind'. 「どういう」 asks for a descriptive explanation.
