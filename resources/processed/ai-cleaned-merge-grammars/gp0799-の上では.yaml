    "writeup": "The grammar point 「の上では」 is used to express that a statement is true or valid only from a particular viewpoint, in a specific context, or according to certain criteria. It implies a limitation and suggests that the same statement may not hold true under different circumstances. It is similar to saying \"in terms of,\" \"regarding,\" or \"from the point of view of\" in English.\n\nIt is commonly used in formal speech and writing, such as in business or academic settings, to clearly define the scope of a statement or argument. This grammar point often introduces a condition or a limitation, such as 「理論の上では」 (in theory) or 「法律の上では」 (legally).",
