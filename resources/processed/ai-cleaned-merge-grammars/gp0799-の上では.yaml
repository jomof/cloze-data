        "usage-context": "Often used in formal settings to precisely define the scope of a statement or argument, emphasizing that its validity is conditional or limited to a specific context.",
        "function": "To indicate that a statement or situation holds true or is valid from a particular viewpoint, according to certain criteria, or within a specified framework.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the statement's truth is conditional and may not extend beyond the specified context or viewpoint, often hinting at a potential contrast with other realities.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions adverbially, modifying the entire clause by specifying the viewpoint or context."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「の上では」 (no ue de wa) literally combines 「の」 (no, a possessive particle), 「上」 (ue, meaning 'above' or 'on'), 「で」 (de, indicating location or state), and 「は」 (wa, a topic marker). The literal sense of 'on top of' or 'above' has metaphorically extended to mean 'from the perspective of' or 'in terms of a certain standard or document'. This reflects a common linguistic phenomenon where spatial relationships are applied to abstract concepts, limiting the scope of a statement as if placing it 'on' a specific conceptual plane.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「の上では」 is used to specify that a statement, fact, or situation is true or applies only within a particular context, condition, or viewpoint. It acts as a qualifier, highlighting that the validity of what is being said is confined to a specific domain, often implying that it might not be true under different circumstances or from other perspectives.\n\nThis expression is frequently encountered in formal discourse, including business, academic, legal, and technical settings. It serves to precisely define the boundaries of an assertion, allowing for nuanced communication. Common collocations include words like 「理論」 (theory), 「書類」 (documents), 「法律」 (law), 「数字」 (figures), or 「計画」 (plan), indicating that the statement's truth is relative to these specific frameworks.\n\nFor instance, 「理論の上では」 means 'in theory' or 'theoretically,' implying that while something might be conceptually sound, its practical application could differ. Similarly, 「法律の上では」 signifies 'legally' or 'from a legal standpoint,' indicating that the statement holds true according to legal statutes, regardless of moral or practical considerations.\n\nUnderstanding 「の上では」 is crucial for grasping statements that delineate specific conditions or perspectives, often setting up a contrast between an ideal or formal situation and a different reality. It's not merely stating a topic; it's defining the specific lens through which something is being viewed.",
