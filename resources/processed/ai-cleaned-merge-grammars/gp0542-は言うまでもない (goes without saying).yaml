jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: general usage
etymology: This phrase literally means something akin to "it doesn't even extend to saying," implying
  that the fact is so obvious it doesn't warrant mentioning. The root of 言う (iu) means "to speak" or "to
  say," while まで (made) indicates "up to" or "even to the extent of." も (mo) here adds an inclusive or
  emphatic nuance, and ない (nai) is the negative form. Together, they form the meaning "not even reaching
  the point of saying," signifying that the matter is self-evident.
writeup: は言うまでもない (wa iu made mo nai) is a versatile grammatical expression used to convey that a certain
  fact or statement is so obvious and self-evident that explicitly stating it is unnecessary. It emphasizes
  the undeniable truth or common understanding of a point. The phrase often attaches to a noun phrase
  or a clause describing the subject of the obvious statement. The particle は (wa) functions as the topic
  marker, highlighting what is being declared as obvious. While often translated as "it goes without saying,"
  it carries a stronger nuance of "it's so obvious, it's not even worth mentioning." This can be used
  to set up a point that is universally accepted before moving on to a less obvious or contrasting idea,
  often introduced by particles like が (ga). It is used across various registers, from formal declarations
  to more casual observations, making it a flexible tool for expressing common sense or established facts.
  When used in more formal or polite contexts, it might be followed by polite endings such as です (desu)
  or でしょう (deshou), or be embedded in more humble or honorific sentence structures.
false_friends:
  - term: 言うまでもなく
    meaning: Needless to say, not to mention
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While は言うまでもない emphasizes that a specific statement is obvious and doesn't require explicit
      mention, 言うまでもなく often functions as an adverbial phrase, meaning "needless to say" or "not to mention,"
      typically introducing an additional point that is also obvious or goes without saying. It's often
      used when listing items where the first is clearly implied or understood, and the second is an obvious
      addition. It acts more like a conjunctive phrase.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:言うまでもなく (needless to say)
  - term: 当然だ
    meaning: It's natural, it's a matter of course
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「当然だ」 expresses that something is a natural outcome or a standard expectation, implying common
      sense. In contrast, 「は言うまでもない」 emphasizes that a fact is so inherently obvious and universally understood
      that explicitly stating it is redundant, almost rhetorical.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:当然だ (natural obvious)
  - term: に決まっている
    meaning: It's surely the case, it's bound to be
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に決まっている」 conveys a strong certainty or conviction about a fact, often based on deduction
      or strong belief. While it can imply obviousness, 「は言うまでもない」 specifically highlights that the fact
      is so self-evident it doesn't even need to be articulated.
    grammar_point: に決まっている (surely is)
post_false_friends_writeup: While は言うまでもない emphasizes that a specific statement is obvious and doesn't
  require explicit mention, making it the predicate of the sentence, 言うまでもなく often functions as an adverbial
  phrase or discourse marker, introducing another point that is similarly obvious. 当然だ (tōzen da) conveys
  that something is a natural and expected outcome, implying common sense. に決まっている (ni kimatte iru) expresses
  strong certainty or conviction, often based on strong belief. The key distinction is that は言うまでもない specifically
  highlights the redundancy of stating something due to its self-evident nature, whereas the others focus
  on the expectedness, certainty, or simple addition of obvious information. Choose は言うまでもない when the
  very act of stating the obvious is what is being commented on.
examples:
  - english: It goes without saying that health is important.
    japanese:
      - 健康 が 大切 だ と いう こと は {は 言う まで も ない}。
      - 健康 が 大切 で ある こと は {は 言う まで も ない} です。
      - 健康 の 大切 さ は {は 言う まで も ない}。
    english_literally: As for me, health is important, it goes without saying.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もちろん 健康 は 大切 だ。
        english: Of course, health is important.
        hint: While 「もちろん」 expresses "of course," it doesn't carry the strong implication that the statement
          is so obvious it need not be said, like 「は言うまでもない」 does. We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes
          the fundamental, self-evident nature of the truth.
    scene: A doctor advises a patient about their lifestyle.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The doctor, an older male, uses 「は言うまでもない」 to convey that the importance of health is a fundamental,
      universally accepted truth, making it seem almost unnecessary to state. This imparts a sense of
      authority and reinforces the obviousness to the patient.
    etymology: 健康 (kenkō) comes from combining 健 (ken), meaning 'healthy,' and 康 (kō), meaning 'peaceful'
      or 'healthy,' emphasizing a state of well-being. 大切 (taisetsu) originally meant 'to cherish' or
      'to value greatly,' deriving from 大 (tai) meaning 'big' or 'great' and 切 (setsu) which implies importance
      or cruciality. Its use here indicates the great value placed on health. いう (iu) 'to say' and までもない
      'not even to reach that point' combine to create the nuance of something being so obvious that speaking
      about it is unnecessary.
  - english: It goes without saying that you'll improve if you practice every day.
    japanese:
      - 毎日 練習 すれ ば 上達 する の は {は 言う まで も ない}。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 毎日 練習 すれ ば 上達 する の は 当たり前 だ。
        english: It is natural to improve if you practice every day.
        hint: 当たり前だ means "it's natural" or "it's a matter of course," but は言うまでもない highlights that the
          truth is so evident it doesn't even warrant being stated. We're looking for a phrase that conveys
          this stronger sense of undeniable obviousness.
    scene: A coach encourages a young athlete.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: inspirational
    nuance: The coach, an older male, uses 「は言うまでもない」 to stress that consistent practice leading to improvement
      is an indisputable, fundamental principle, aiming to inspire the young athletes. The phrase implies
      that this truth is so self-evident that it's beyond question.
    etymology: 毎日 (mainichi) literally means 'every day,' formed from 毎 (mai) 'every' and 日 (nichi) 'day'.
      練習 (renshū) combines 練 (ren) 'to train' and 習 (shū) 'to learn,' referring to practice or training.
      上達 (jōtatsu) means 'improvement' or 'progress,' coming from 上 (jō) 'up' or 'superior' and 達 (tatsu)
      'to reach' or 'to achieve', signifying reaching a higher level.

          - 彼 の 才能 は 言う に 及ば ない が、努力 も 欠かさ ない。
        english: There is no need to mention his talent, but he never neglects his efforts either.
        hint: 言うに及ばない often implies something is so great or terrible that words can't capture it, or
          it's irrelevant. は言うまでもない specifically means the fact is so obvious it goes without saying.
          We're looking for a phrase emphasizing the obviousness of his talent.
    scene: Two colleagues discuss a highly successful individual.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This statement uses 「は言うまでもない」 to convey that the person's talent is so overtly obvious and
      universally acknowledged that it almost doesn't require explicit mention. The nuance is further
      enhanced by the use of 「が」 (ga) to introduce a contrasting point, emphasizing that despite the obvious
      talent, continuous effort is also a crucial factor.
    etymology: 才能 (sainō) meaning 'talent' or 'ability,' is composed of 才 (sai) 'talent' and 能 (nō) 'ability'.
      努力 (doryoku) means 'effort' or 'endeavor,' combining 努 (do) 'to exert' and 力 (ryoku) 'power' or
      'strength', indicating the exertion of strength to achieve something. 欠かさない (kakasana nai) means
      'never neglects,' derived from 欠かす (kaka su) 'to miss' or 'to neglect'.

        english: It is a matter of course that you should follow traffic rules.
        hint: 当然のことだ expresses something is natural or expected. は言うまでもない conveys that the rule is so
          self-evident that stating it explicitly is unnecessary. We're looking for a phrase that stresses
          this level of inherent obviousness.
    scene: A driving instructor reminds their student about basic regulations.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: The instructor, an older male, uses 「は言うまでもない」 to underscore that adhering to traffic rules
      is a fundamental and self-evident responsibility, implying it's a basic expectation that doesn't
      need detailed explanation. This emphasizes the obviousness to the student.
    etymology: 交通 (kōtsū) refers to 'traffic' or 'transportation,' from 交 (kō) 'interchange' and 通 (tsū)
      'pass through'. ルール (rūru) is a loanword from English 'rule'. 守る (mamoru) means 'to protect' or
      'to obey,' implying adherence to rules or laws.

        english: That restaurant's food must be delicious, right?
        hint: に決まっている means "it must be" or "it's definitely," expressing a strong certainty. は言うまでもない
          implies the deliciousness is so universally acknowledged it goes without saying. We're looking
          for a phrase that conveys this shared, undeniable truth.
    scene: Two female friends finishing a meal at their favorite spot.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「は言うまでもない」 highlights the obviousness of the statement that the restaurant's food
      is delicious, almost as if it's a shared secret or a well-known fact between them. The addition
      of 「よね」 (yo ne) at the end, commonly used by female speakers in casual conversation, softens the
      assertion and invites confirmation or agreement from the listener, emphasizing shared understanding.
    etymology: レストラン (resutoran) is a loanword from English 'restaurant'. 料理 (ryōri) means 'cuisine' or
      'dish,' composed of 料 (ryō) 'ingredients' or 'materials' and 理 (ri) 'reason' or 'arrangement'. 美味しい
      (oishii) means 'delicious' or 'tasty,' its origin is somewhat debated but it evolved from words
      meaning 'pleasant to the mouth'.

      - 時間 厳守 が 大切 な の は {は 言う まで も ない} よ ね。
    english_literally: That punctuality is important, it goes without saying, right?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 時間 厳守 が 大切 な の は 当たり前 だろ？
        english: Punctuality is important, isn't that obvious?
        hint: While 「当たり前だろ？」 implies obviousness, 「は言うまでもない」 emphasizes that the statement is so self-evident
          that it is almost unnecessary to even utter it. We're looking for a phrase that carries this
          stronger rhetorical weight of unquestionable truth.
    scene: An older male mentor lectures a younger male intern about professionalism.
    register: casual
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「は言うまでもない」 here by an older male mentor stresses that punctuality is an undeniable,
      basic principle of professionalism, implying it's so obvious it doesn't need to be debated. The
      casual male speech pattern 「だろ？」 (daro) is added to confirm the obviousness with the listener, common
      when an older male addresses a younger male in an instructional or advisory context, seeking implicit
      agreement.
    etymology: 時間 (jikan) means 'time,' from 時 (ji) 'time' and 間 (kan) 'interval'. 厳守 (genshu) means 'strict
      observance' or 'punctuality,' combining 厳 (gen) 'strict' and 守 (shu) 'to observe' and 'to protect'.
      Together, 時間厳守 refers to strict adherence to time schedules, emphasizing punctuality.

      without saying.

          - 当社 の 製品 が 最高 品質 で ある こと は 申す まで も ござい ませ ん。
        english: It goes without saying that our company's products are of the highest quality (humble).
        hint: 申すまでもございません is a humble form that means "there's no need to say." While very close, は言うまでもない
          is a more general phrase for obviousness across various registers, whereas the humble form is
          specifically used when talking humbly about oneself or one's company. We're looking for the
          standard phrase that implies "it goes without saying."
    scene: A company executive addresses potential investors during a presentation.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male

    nuance: An executive, likely an older male, uses 「は言うまでもない」 to assert that the company's product quality
      is an undeniable, self-evident truth, thus making it a strong, unquestionable basis for their presentation.

        english: Regular inspection of fire alarms is naturally necessary.
        hint: 当然必要だ means it is "naturally necessary" or "obviously required." は言うまでもない suggests the necessity
          is so fundamental and evident that it doesn't need to be stated. We're looking for a phrase
          that expresses this level of undeniable, self-evident truth.
    scene: A building manager issues a safety memo to residents.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: In a formal memo, the use of 「は言うまでもない」 emphasizes that the need for regular fire alarm inspections
      is a critical and universally accepted safety measure, implying it's a basic responsibility so obvious
      it shouldn't need explicit mention. This formal tone conveys the seriousness and undisputed nature
      of the requirement.
    etymology: 火災 (kasai) means 'fire' or 'conflagration,' from 火 (ka) 'fire' and 災 (sai) 'disaster'.
      報知 (hōchi) means 'notice' or 'report,' from 報 (hō) 'report' and 知 (chi) 'to know'. 器 (ki) means
      'device' or 'container'. Thus, 火災報知器 is a 'fire alarm device'. 定期 的 (teikiteki) means 'periodic'
      or 'regular,' 点検 (tenken) means 'inspection' or 'checkup'.

          this undeniable obviousness.
    scene: A librarian recommends books to a student.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The librarian, an older female, uses 「は言うまでもない」 to articulate that reading's benefit in broadening
      knowledge is an undeniable, foundational truth, common within an academic context. The phrase implies
      that this fact is so self-evident it hardly requires stating, lending an air of established wisdom
      to the advice.
    etymology: 読書 (dokusho) means 'reading books,' from 読 (doku) 'to read' and 書 (sho) 'book'. 知識 (chishiki)
      means 'knowledge,' from 知 (chi) 'to know' and 識 (shiki) 'to distinguish'. 広げる (hirogeru) means 'to
      broaden' or 'to expand,' originally from 'to spread out'.

        english: The natural beauty of this country is something everyone acknowledges.
        hint: 誰もが認める means "everyone acknowledges." While this implies widespread acceptance, は言うまでもない

          looking for a phrase that emphasizes the beauty's unquestionable obviousness.
    scene: A tour guide praises the scenery to a group of tourists.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The tour guide, a male, employs 「は言うまでもない」 to convey that the country's natural beauty is
      so overwhelmingly obvious and breathtaking that it's beyond the need for words. The addition of
      「ほど だ」 (hodo da) further emphasizes the degree, suggesting the beauty is so immense that describing
      it fully is impossible, thus immediately impressing upon the tourists its exceptional quality.
    etymology: 国 (kuni) means 'country' or 'nation'. 自然 (shizen) means 'nature,' from 自 (ji) 'self' and
      然 (zen) 'so,' literally 'to be so by oneself'. 美しい (utsukushii) means 'beautiful,' a native Japanese
      word that has evolved over centuries. ほど (hodo) is a particle indicating degree or extent, often
      used to express 'to the extent that' or 'so much that'.

        english: It is self-evident that humans need water.
        hint: 自明だ means "it's self-evident" or "obvious." While similar, は言うまでもない often carries a slightly
          more emphatic or rhetorical tone, strongly implying that the fact is so basic it's redundant
          to state. We're looking for a phrase that conveys this sense of undeniable, almost unstated
          truth.
    scene: A science teacher explains basic biological needs.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: An older female science teacher uses 「は言うまでもない」 to highlight that the necessity of water for
      human life is a fundamental, indisputable biological truth, so obvious that it requires no debate
      or elaborate explanation. This phrase reinforces the foundational nature of the statement in an
      academic context.
    etymology: 人間 (ningen) means 'human being' or 'mankind,' from 人 (jin/nin) 'person' and 間 (gen/kan)
      'interval' or 'space,' implying a being that exists among others. 水 (mizu) means 'water.' 必要 (hitsuyō)
      means 'necessary' or 'essential,' from 必 (hitsu) 'certainly' and 要 (yō) 'need' or 'require'.
post_example_writeup: This grammar point is highly versatile, effectively communicating that a fact or
  statement is so obvious it needs no elaboration. It can be adapted across various registers and settings,
  from casual conversation to formal business communication, to emphasize undeniable truths or expected
  behaviors. The choice of preceding structure (e.g., こと は, の は, or a direct noun) and accompanying sentence-ending
  particles allows for subtle variations in tone and emphasis, while the core meaning of "it goes without
  saying" remains consistent.
