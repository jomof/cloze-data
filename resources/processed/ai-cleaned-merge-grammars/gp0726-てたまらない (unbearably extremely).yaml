details:
  usage-context: This expression is generally used in a standard context and is widely applicable across
    various situations.
  logical-flow: Indicates an intense state or feeling that is difficult to endure or control, often leading
    to a natural consequence or expression.
  temporal-flow: Describes an ongoing state or feeling at the moment of utterance, or a past state if

etymology: The grammar point 「てたまらない」 combines the 「て」 form of a verb or adjective with 「堪らない (たまらない)」.
  The verb 堪る (たまる) literally means "to endure," "to bear," or "to tolerate." Therefore, 「堪らない」 means
  "cannot endure," or "cannot tolerate." When appended to the 「て」 form of a verb or adjective, it vividly
  conveys the idea that the preceding feeling or desire is so intense or overwhelming that one literally
  'cannot bear it' or 'cannot stand it.' This etymological root strongly underpinning its meaning of an
  irresistible urge or an unbearable state.
writeup: |-
  「てたまらない」 expresses a feeling or desire that is overwhelming, intense, or unbearable. It manifests in two primary nuances, depending on what precedes it:

  *   **"Can't help but want to (A)"**: This nuance is exclusively used with verbs conjugated into their 「たい」 form. It signifies an irresistible and profound desire to perform an action. For instance, 「～たくてたまらない」 indicates an overwhelming urge, meaning "I can't help but want to do ~."

  *   **"Extremely (A)" or "Unbearably (A)"**: This nuance is applied to both い-adjectives and な-adjectives, indicating an extreme state or feeling that is difficult to endure. For い-adjectives, it takes the form 「～くてたまらない」 (e.g., 「暑くてたまらない」 - "It's unbearably hot"). For な-adjectives, it uses 「～でたまらない」 (e.g., 「心配でたまらない」 - "I'm unbearably worried"). In essence, the speaker is expressing that the feeling or state is so strong it cannot be tolerated.
false_friends:
  - term: てならない
    meaning: Very, Extremely, Can't help but do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express strong feelings, 「てならない」 often implies a more natural or spontaneous emergence
      of emotion, almost as if the feeling 'naturally becomes' so. In contrast, 「てたまらない」 emphasizes the
      feeling's intensity to the point of being unbearable or difficult to control, suggesting a deeper,
      more physically impactful sensation.
    grammar_point: てならない (uncontrollably feels)
  - term: ざるを得ない
    meaning: Can't help doing, Have no choice but
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ざるを得ない」 denotes an action that one is forced to take due to circumstances, indicating a lack
      of choice. 「てたまらない」, however, describes an internal, overwhelming feeling or desire that is difficult
      to suppress, not an external obligation to act.
    grammar_point: ざるを得ない (have no choice but to)
  - term: てしょうがない
    meaning: Cannot help but; cannot bear; extremely (feeling or sensation that is uncontrollable)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てしょうがない」, like 「てたまらない」, expresses a strong feeling. However, 「てしょうがない」 can carry a nuance
      of resignation or acceptance, implying that the feeling is intense but 'cannot be helped' or 'is
      pointless to resist.' 「てたまらない」 focuses more purely on the sheer unbearable intensity of the feeling
      itself.
    grammar_point: てしょうがない (cannot help but)
  - term: ないわけにはいかない
    meaning: Can't not, No way to avoid
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ないわけにはいかない」 signifies a strong obligation or necessity to do something; one simply 'cannot
      not do it.' This is distinct from 「てたまらない」, which conveys an overwhelming internal feeling or desire
      rather than an external compulsion.
    grammar_point: ないわけにはいかない (inevitable necessity)
  - term: ことに
    meaning: Extremely, Especially, To my...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ことに」 is typically used to highlight an aspect or emotion with a sense of surprise or strong
      realization, often appearing before a noun or adjective to emphasize it (e.g., 「残念なことに」 - 'regrettably').
      「てたまらない」, in contrast, specifically describes an overwhelming, unbearable internal state or desire,
      directly modifying a verb or adjective.
    grammar_point: ことに (to my emotion or feeling)
  - term: ずにはいられない
    meaning: Cannot help doing something, Cannot resist doing something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ずにはいられない」 indicates an irresistible urge to perform an action, akin to 'cannot help but do.'
      While similar to 「てたまらない」 when used with the 「たい」 form, 「てたまらない」 is broader, also applying to adjectives
      to describe an overwhelming state (e.g., 'unbearably hot'), whereas 「ずにはいられない」 always implies an
      action.
    grammar_point: ずにはいられない (cannot help but do)
  - term: 限りだ
    meaning: Extremely, Really, Very, As ... as one can be
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「限りだ」 expresses the utmost degree of a certain emotion or state, often implying a logical
      conclusion based on external observation (e.g., 「残念な限りだ」 - 'It's as regrettable as can be'). 「てたまらない」
      focuses on an internal, unbearable feeling or desire, emphasizing the personal difficulty in enduring
      it.
    grammar_point: Adjective + 限りだ (utmost degree)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between these similar expressions, consider whether the
  grammar point emphasizes an internal, unbearable feeling, an irresistible urge, or an external obligation.
  「てたまらない」 consistently highlights the overwhelming, almost intolerable nature of a feeling or desire.
  Other expressions might focus on the natural emergence of a feeling, a forced action, or a logical degree
  of a state, but rarely carry the direct sense of 'unbearability' as strongly as 「てたまらない」.

  various contexts demonstrates its versatility in conveying intense internal states.
