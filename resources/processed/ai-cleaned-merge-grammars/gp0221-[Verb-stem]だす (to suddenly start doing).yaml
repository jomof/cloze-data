pronunciation:
  katakana: ダス
  romaji: dasu
formation:
  '[Verb stem] + だす': Indicates the sudden or unexpected start of an action.
jlpt: N4
details:
  usage-context: General use
  function: Indicates the sudden onset of an action.
  nuance: Often carries a nuance of something being unintentional or beyond immediate control, emphasizing
    spontaneity.
etymology: The grammar point 「だす」 originates from the verb 「出す」 (dasu), which means "to take out" or "to
  put out." The nuance of something emerging or becoming apparent is extended to indicate the sudden commencement
  of an action.
writeup: 'The grammar point 「だす」, written as 出す in kanji, is a verb that''s added to the ます-stem (連用形)
  of another verb. It indicates the sudden or unexpected start of an action. Think of it as "to burst
  into (A)" or "to suddenly do (A)." This suffix allows for the expression of an action beginning abruptly
  or spontaneously. To form this construction, attach 「だす」 to the ます-stem of the verb. For example, 走り
  (hashiri, run) + 「だす」 becomes 走り{だす} (hashiri dasu) "to suddenly start running." **Important Considerations**:
  Unlike 「はじめる」 (hajimeru), which also means "to begin", 「だす」 often carries a nuance of being unintentional
  or something the subject can''t control. 「はじめる」, on the other hand, implies a direct intention to start
  something. Consider the context carefully to choose between 「だす」 and 「はじめる」. 「だす」 is suited for spontaneous
  actions.'
false_friends:
  - term: おわる
    meaning: To finish, to end
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「だす」, which signifies the commencement of an action, 「おわる」 indicates its completion.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]おわる (to finish doing)'
  - term: はじめる
    meaning: To start; To begin to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While both indicate starting an action, 「だす」 implies suddenness, while 「はじめる」 suggests a more
      intentional start.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]はじめる (to start doing)'
  - term: いきなり
    meaning: For no reason, suddenly, all of a sudden
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いきなり」 is an adverb describing the manner of an action, while 「だす」 is a verb indicating the
      beginning of an action. 「いきなり」 can modify a verb, but it doesn't attach to it like 「だす」.
    grammar_point: いきなり (suddenly・without warning)
  - term: かけ
    meaning: Half-, not yet finished, about to, begin to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「かけ」 indicates an action is in progress or about to begin, while 「だす」 focuses on the moment
      the action starts.
    grammar_point: かけ (incomplete or on the verge)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「だす」 highlights the abrupt or unexpected
  commencement of an action, while 「はじめる」 implies a more intentional start. 「いきなり」 describes the manner
  of the action, and 「かけ」 indicates an action is in progress. Consider the specific nuance you want to
  convey when choosing the right word.
examples:
  - english: The baby suddenly started crying.
    japanese:
      - 赤ちゃん は 泣き {だし た}。
      - 赤ちゃん が 泣き {だし た}。
      - 赤ちゃん が 急 に 泣き {だし た}。
      - 赤ちゃん は 泣き {だし まし た}。
    english_literally: The baby burst into crying.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 赤ちゃん は 泣き {始め た}。
        english: The baby began to cry.
        hint: 「はじめる」implies a more intentional start, while 「だす」 suggests an abrupt, unexpected beginning.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 赤ちゃん が 突然 泣き {始め た}。
        english: The baby suddenly began to cry.
        hint: While 「突然」 emphasizes suddenness, 「はじめる」 still implies a more deliberate beginning compared
          to 「だす」.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 赤ちゃん が 泣き 出し た {ところ だ}。
        english: The baby has just started crying.
        hint: 「ところだ」 emphasizes that the action has just commenced. We are looking for the general sudden
          onset of crying.
    scene: A mother is explaining to her friend why she is tired.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker, a mother, uses 「泣きだした」 to describe the baby's action, emphasizing the spontaneity
      and abruptness of the crying. Given it's a mother talking about her baby, the casual register is
      appropriate.
  - english: It started to rain.
    japanese:
      - 雨 が 降り {だし た}。
      - 急 に 雨 が 降り {だし た}。
      - 雨 が 降り {だし まし た}。
    english_literally: Rain started to fall out.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 が 降り {始め た}。
        english: It began to rain.
        hint: 「はじめる」implies a more intentional beginning, while 「だす」 highlights the sudden and often unexpected
          onset of rain.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 が 降っ {て き た}。
        english: It has come to rain.
        hint: 「～てくる」 indicates a change or movement towards the speaker/present state. While it can imply
          a start, it lacks the specific 'sudden burst' nuance of 「だす」.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 が 降り 出し た {ところ だ}。
        english: It has just started raining.
        hint: 「ところだ」 indicates an action has just taken place. We are looking for the general sudden onset
          of rain.
    scene: Two friends are walking down the street and it starts to rain.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The speaker simply states a fact about the world, that it has just started raining. 「降りだした」
      highlights the sudden onset of rain, which is typically an unexpected event. It would be equally
      acceptable to say 「雨が降り始めました」, but 「だす」 adds the nuance of suddenness.
  - english: I was surprised when he suddenly stood up.
    japanese:
      - 彼 が 立ち {だし た} 時、私 は びっくり し た わ。
      - 彼 が 立ち {だし まし た} 時、私 は びっくり し まし た わ。
      - 彼 が 突然 立ち {だし た} 時、私 は びっくり し た わ。
      - 彼 が 立ち {だし た} とき、私 は 驚い た わ。
    english_literally: When he suddenly stood up, I was surprised.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 立ち {始め た} 時、私 は 驚い た わ。
        english: I was surprised when he began to stand up.
        hint: The scene focuses on the element of surprise, which is best conveyed by the unexpectedness
          implied by 「だす」, rather than a simple beginning.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 突然 立ち上がっ た 時、私 は びっくり し た わ。
        english: When he suddenly stood up, I was surprised.
        hint: 「立ち上がる」 means to stand up. While '突然' means suddenly, 'だす' directly attaches to the verb
          stem to convey the sudden *onset* of the action itself, giving a stronger sense of a sudden
          burst.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 立ち上がり {始め た} 時、私 は びっくり し た わ。
        english: When he began to stand up, I was surprised.
        hint: 「立ち上がる」 means to stand up. Using 「はじめる」 emphasizes the beginning of the action, but not
          necessarily the *sudden burst* into that action like 「だす」.
    scene: A woman is telling a story to a male friend about something unexpected that happened.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker, a woman, expresses her surprise using 「びっくりしたわ」, where 「わ」 is a feminine sentence-ending
      particle that adds a soft, emotional, or assertive nuance. 「立ちだした」 emphasizes the unexpectedness
      of his action, contributing to her surprise.
  - english: Once she starts talking, she keeps talking.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 話し {だす と}、ずっと 話し て いる。
      - 彼女 は 話し {だす} と、もう 止まら ない。
      - 彼女 は 話し {だす} と、ずっと 話し 続ける。
    english_literally: When she starts to speak out, she keeps talking.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 話し {始める} と、止まら ない。
        english: Once she starts talking, she doesn't stop.
        hint: The scene portrays a characteristic of the person that is often involuntary or difficult
          to stop once it starts, aligning with the uncontrollable nuance of 「だす」.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 話し {始める} と、ずっと 話し て いる。
        english: Once she begins talking, she keeps talking.
        hint: 「はじめる」 can also mean 'to begin', but 「だす」 specifically carries the nuance of a sudden, often
          uncontrollable, burst into action. This makes it more suitable for describing a continuous,
          characteristic behavior.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 話す {と}、ずっと 話し て いる。
        english: When she talks, she keeps talking.
        hint: This is a simple conditional. While grammatically correct, it lacks the nuance of the *onset*
          of talking that 「だす」 provides, which is crucial for conveying the idea that once she starts,
          there's no stopping.
    scene: Describing someone who is very talkative.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The use of 「話しだす」 in this context implies that once she begins speaking, it's an almost uncontrollable
      flow, which is characteristic of the 「だす」 nuance. The 「～と」 conditional emphasizes this inevitable
      outcome. The phrase 「ずっと話している」 clearly conveys that she continues talking without stopping, reinforcing
      the idea of an uncontrollable flow.
  - english: Does anyone have any questions before the teacher starts explaining?
    japanese:
      - 先生 が 説明 し {だす} 前 に、質問 が ある 人 は い ます か。
      - 先生 が 説明 し {だす} 前 に、ご 質問 は あり ます か。
      - 先生 が 説明 し {ださ れる} 前 に、質問 が ある 方 は いらっしゃい ます か。
      - 先生 が 説明 し {だす} 前 に、何 か 質問 は あり ます か。
    english_literally: Before the teacher starts to explain out, is there anyone with questions?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 が 説明 し {始める} 前 に、質問 が ある 人 は い ます か。
        english: Does anyone have any questions before the teacher begins explaining?
        hint: The scene sets up a formal, instructional context where the teacher is about to initiate
          an explanation, making 「だす」 suitable for marking the abrupt beginning of the lecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 が 説明 {する} 前 に、質問 が ある 人 は い ます か。
        english: This is a general way to say 'when the teacher explains'. 「だす」 specifically implies the
          sudden onset of explanation, often used when marking a clear point where something is about
          to commence abruptly.
        hint: This is a general way to say 'when the teacher explains'. 「だす」 specifically implies the
          sudden onset of explanation, often used when marking a clear point where something is about
          to commence abruptly.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 が 説明 を {始める} 前 に、質問 が ある 人 は い ます か。
        english: Does anyone have any questions before the teacher begins the explanation?
        hint: This uses the transitive verb 「始める」 to mean 'to start the explanation'. While similar, 「だす」
          is typically used as a suffix to another verb stem, emphasizing the *bursting into* action.
    scene: A teacher asking the students if they have any questions before beginning the lecture.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The teacher uses a polite and formal tone appropriate for addressing a class. 「説明しだす」 here
      indicates the point at which the explanation will spontaneously begin, perhaps after a brief pause
      or preparation, rather than a planned start (which `はじめる` might imply).
  - english: Because he started crying, I talked to him.
    japanese:
      - 彼 が 泣き {だし た} の で、私 は 話しかけ た。
      - 彼 が 泣き {だし た} から、私 は 話しかけ た。
      - 彼 が 泣き {だし た} の で、私 は 話しかけ まし た。
      - 彼 が 突然 泣き {だし た} の で、私 は 話しかけ た。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 泣き {始め た} の で、私 は 慰め た。
        english: Because he began to cry, I comforted him.
        hint: The scene implies a sudden onset of distress that prompted immediate comfort, emphasizing
          the involuntary and abrupt nature of the crying best captured by 「だす」.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 突然 泣い た の で、私 は 話しかけ た。
        english: Because he suddenly cried, I talked to him.
        hint: 「突然」 emphasizes suddenness but applies to the simple action of crying. 「泣きだした」 highlights
          the sudden *onset* or *burst* into crying, suggesting a stronger, more immediate reaction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 泣き {始め た} の で、私 は 話しかけ た。
        english: Because he began to cry, I talked to him.
        hint: 「はじめる」 indicates a general start. 「だす」 conveys a more abrupt and often uncontrollable start,
          making it more impactful when describing an emotional outburst like crying.
    scene: Describing a situation where someone was upset and needed comfort, leading to a supportive
      interaction.
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「泣きだした」 emphasizes the sudden onset of crying, highlighting that it was an immediate and perhaps
      unexpected outburst that prompted the speaker to respond by talking to him. The sympathetic setting
      aligns with this.
  - english: When the song began, everyone became quiet.
    japanese:
      - 歌 が 始まり {だし た} 時、みんな 静か に なっ た。
      - 歌 が 始まり {だす と}、みんな 静か に なっ た。
      - 歌 が 始まり {だし まし た} 時、みんな 静か に なり まし た。
      - 歌 が 始まり {だし た} 瞬間、みんな 静か に なっ た。
    english_literally: When the song started out, everyone became quiet.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 演奏 が 始まっ た 瞬間、観客 は 静まり返っ た。
        english: The moment the performance started, the audience fell silent.
        hint: The scene implies a sudden, perhaps abrupt, commencement of the song, which is best captured
          by 「だす」 to highlight the immediate reaction from the listeners.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 歌 が 始まっ た 時、みんな 静か に なっ た。
        english: When the song began, everyone became quiet.
        hint: This is a simple way to say 'when the song started'. 「始まりだした」 specifically emphasizes the
          sudden or abrupt *commencement* of the song, suggesting it 'burst into' existence.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 歌 が 流れ {始め た} 時、みんな 静か に なっ た。
        english: When the song started playing, everyone became quiet.
        hint: 「流れ始める」 means 'to start flowing/playing'. While it indicates a beginning, it lacks the specific
          nuance of a sudden, perhaps unexpected, *burst* into sound that 「始まりだした」 conveys.
    scene: Describing the start of a musical event.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「始まりだした」 here emphasizes the unexpected or abrupt commencement of the song, rather than a
      smoothly planned start, which caused everyone to immediately become quiet 「静かになった」. This change
      from noise to quiet highlights the sudden onset of the music.
  - english: Um, is it okay if I start to speak?
    japanese:
      - あの う、言い {だし て も} いい です か？
      - あの う、言い {だし て} も よろしい です か？
      - あの う、申し上げ {だし て} も よろしい でしょう か？
      - あの う、ちょっと 話し {だし て} も いい です か？
    english_literally: Um, is it okay even if I start to speak out?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの う、言い {始め て} も いい です か？
        english: Um, is it okay if I begin to speak?
        hint: The scene highlights the employee's hesitation and the potentially sensitive nature of what
          they are about to say. 「だす」 emphasizes the suddenness of bringing up the topic, making the request
          for permission more appropriate.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの う、話し {て も いい} です か？
        english: Um, is it okay if I talk?
        hint: This is a general way to ask permission to speak. 「言いだしても」 specifically suggests asking
          permission to *start* saying something, implying it was unexpected that they would *start* saying
          it at all.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの う、発言 し {て も いい} です か？
        english: Um, is it okay if I make a statement?
        hint: 「発言する」 is a more formal verb for 'to speak' or 'to make a statement'. While appropriate
          for a professional setting, it doesn't carry the nuance of 'suddenly starting to speak' like
          「言いだす」.
    scene: An employee is speaking to his boss.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker uses 「言いだしてもいいですか？」, combining 「だす」 with the 「～てもいいですか」 pattern, to create a deferential
      tone suitable for speaking to a superior. This construction implies a sudden or perhaps difficult
      topic is about to be broached. The speaker's hesitancy is further conveyed by 「あのう」. This is an
      example of respectful language (謙譲語) as the speaker humbles their own action.
  - english: I never thought you'd start saying something like that.
    japanese:
      - 君 が そんな こと 言い {だす} なんて、思わ なかっ た。
      - 君 が そんな こと を 言い {だす} なんて、思わ なかっ た。
      - 君 が そんな こと 言い {だす} と は 思わ なかっ た。
      - まさ か 君 が そんな こと 言い {だす} と は 思わ なかっ た。
    english_literally: That you would start to say out such a thing, I didn't think.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 君 が そんな こと 言い {始める} なんて、思わ なかっ た。
        english: I never thought you'd begin saying something like that.
        hint: The scene emphasizes the speaker's disbelief at the other person's sudden and unexpected
          statement, which is precisely the nuance conveyed by 「だす」.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 君 が そんな こと 言う {なんて}、思わ なかっ た。
        english: I never thought you'd say something like that.
        hint: This is a general expression of surprise about someone's words. 「言いだす」 specifically emphasizes
          the *sudden onset* of saying something, implying it was unexpected that they would *start* saying
          it at all.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 君 が 突然 そんな こと を 言い {始める} なんて、思わ なかっ た。
        english: While '突然' emphasizes suddenness, 'はじめる' still implies a more deliberate or intentional
          beginning, whereas 'だす' suggests a more spontaneous and often unexpected burst into speech.
        hint: While '突然' emphasizes suddenness, 'はじめる' still implies a more deliberate or intentional
          beginning, whereas 'だす' suggests a more spontaneous and often unexpected burst into speech.
    scene: Expressing surprise or disbelief at someone's statement.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「言いだす」 here emphasizes the unexpected and abrupt nature of the other person's statement. The
      phrase 「思わなかった」 directly underscores the speaker's surprise and disbelief at the listener's uncharacteristic
      remark. The use of 「君」 by a male speaker to a female listener in a casual context can imply a close
      relationship or a slightly condescending tone, depending on intonation.
  - english: Hey, why don't you start depending on me more?
    japanese:
      - ねえ、もっと 僕 に 甘え {だし て} よ。
      - ねえ、もっと 僕 に 甘え {だし て} くれ よ。
      - ねえ、もっと 僕 に 甘え {だせ} よ。
      - ねえ、もっと 僕 に 甘え {だし て} ほしい な。
    english_literally: Hey, please start to depend out on me more.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ねえ、もっと 僕 に 甘え {始め て} よ。
        english: Hey, why don't you begin depending on me more?
        hint: The scene suggests a desire for a sudden, spontaneous shift in the relationship towards
          greater intimacy, which is captured by the abruptness implied by 「だす」.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ねえ、もっと 僕 に 甘え {て} よ。
        english: Hey, depend on me more.
        hint: This simply asks the person to depend more. 「甘えだして」 specifically suggests the *initiation*
          of this behavior, implying a desire for a new phase where they start to be more dependent.

          - ねえ、もっと 僕 に 急 に 甘え {始め て} よ。
        english: While '急に' adds suddenness, 'はじめる' implies a more intentional start to the act of depending,
          whereas 'だす' conveys a more spontaneous and emotional *burst* into that behavior.
        hint: While '急に' adds suddenness, 'はじめる' implies a more intentional start to the act of depending,
          whereas 'だす' conveys a more spontaneous and emotional *burst* into that behavior.
    scene: A man speaking to a woman he likes.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Using 「甘えだして」 in the te-form followed by 「よ」 softens the request, making it more suggestive
      and playful, suitable for a flirty setting. 「だす」 here encourages the sudden or spontaneous onset
      of relying on the speaker. The use of 「ねえ」 indicates a casual, intimate tone, and 「僕」 is a common
      male first-person pronoun.
    etymology: 「甘える」 (amaeru) has an etymological link to depending on someone's sweetness (甘い, amai).
post_example_writeup: Remember that while both 「だす」 and 「はじめる」 indicate the start of an action, 「だす」 often
  implies suddenness or lack of control, whereas 「はじめる」 indicates a more intentional beginning. Pay close
  attention to the context to choose the most appropriate expression.
