formation:
  Verb [masu-stem] + やすい: Indicates a tendency or predisposition towards an action.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  function: Expresses a tendency, likelihood, or susceptibility to an action or state.
  nuance: Often used for inherent characteristics, frequent occurrences, or situations where something
    is easily affected. While it can carry a slight negative nuance, it is not exclusively negative and
    is broader than がち or きらいがある.
  grammatical-role: Forms a compound adjective, modifying a verb's action to describe its inherent ease
    of happening or tendency.
  temporal-flow: Describes an ongoing or habitual tendency rather than a single event.
etymology: The suffix 「やすい」 originates from the い-adjective 「易い」 (yasui), meaning "easy to do" or "simple."
  Over time, its usage extended to describe not just the ease of an action, but also an inherent tendency
  or a predisposition for something to occur, often with a nuance of susceptibility. This evolution reflects
  how something "easy to do" can also imply something that is "likely to happen" or "prone to." The same
  form is used for both "easy to do" and "prone to/likely to," which can sometimes be a source of confusion
  for learners.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「〜やすい」, when indicating a tendency, is used to describe that someone or something has a predisposition or likelihood to perform a certain action or fall into a certain state. It attaches to the **masu-stem** of a verb and conjugates like a regular い-adjective.

  While this form can mean "easy to do" (e.g., 読みやすい - easy to read), its "prone to/likely to" meaning emphasizes an inherent characteristic or a recurring pattern, often (but not always) implying a slight negative connotation or an undesirable outcome. For instance, if someone is said to 「怒りやすい」, it means they are "prone to getting angry" or "easily angered," describing a character trait. Similarly, if an object is 「壊れやすい」, it is "prone to breaking" or "fragile."

  It is crucial to distinguish this meaning from the "easy to do" meaning of 「〜やすい」. Context usually clarifies which nuance is intended, but understanding the difference is key to proper comprehension and usage. This grammatical construction points to a natural inclination or a susceptibility.
false_friends:
  - term: '[V-stem]やすい (easy to do)'
    meaning: easy to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both use the same form, this refers to the ease with which an action can be performed,
      whereas the current grammar point describes a tendency or predisposition for something to happen.
    grammar_point: '[V-stem]やすい (easy to do)'
  - term: がち (tend to)
    meaning: Apt to do, Tend to do, Prone to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both express a tendency, but 「がち」 carries a stronger and almost exclusive nuance of a negative,
      undesirable, or frequent habit. 「〜やすい (prone to)」 is broader and can be neutral or positive, though
      it often suggests a less controlled or spontaneous occurrence.
    grammar_point: がち (tend to)
  - term: きらいがある (undesirable tendency)
    meaning: Have a tendency to, Tend to, Be slightly~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「〜やすい (prone to)」 which can be neutral or negative, 「きらいがある」 is almost exclusively
      used for undesirable or problematic tendencies, implying a fault or defect in character or behavior.
    grammar_point: きらいがある (undesirable tendency)
  - term: にくい (difficult to do)
    meaning: Difficult to, Hard to
    kind: antonym
    nuance: This is the direct opposite of the 'easy to do' sense of 「〜やすい」, indicating difficulty in
      performing an action. While 「〜やすい (prone to)」 describes likelihood, 「にくい」 implies resistance or
      difficulty.
    grammar_point: にくい (difficult to do)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「〜やすい」, 「がち」, and 「きらいがある」 all convey a sense of tendency, their nuances
  differ. 「〜やすい」 focuses on an inherent characteristic or susceptibility. 「がち」 typically implies an undesirable
  habit or frequent negative occurrence. 「きらいがある」 is reserved for specific, usually negative, personal
  or behavioral faults.
examples:
  - english: My grandfather is prone to forgetting things these days.
    japanese:
      - 祖父 は 最近、物 を {忘れ やすい}。
      - 祖父 は 最近、物 を {忘れ やすい} です。
      - 祖父 は 最近、物 を {忘れ やすい} ん です。
    english_literally: Grandfather, recently, things, prone to forgetting.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 祖父 は 最近、物 を 忘れ がち だ。
        english: My grandfather tends to forget things these days (implying a negative habit).
        hint: While both imply a tendency, 「忘れがち」 highlights a negative, frequent habit. 「忘れやすい」 indicates
          an inherent predisposition or susceptibility.
    scene: A family member is discussing their grandfather's memory with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「忘れやすい」 here describes an inherent characteristic of the grandfather's memory,
      implying he is susceptible to forgetting. It's a neutral observation about his condition.
  - english: This smartphone screen is prone to getting scratched easily.
    japanese:
      - この スマホ の 画面 は 傷 が {つき やすい}。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この スマホ の 画面 は 傷 が つき がち だ。
        english: This smartphone screen tends to get scratched (implies a frequent, undesirable habit
          of the screen, which doesn't make sense for an object).
        hint: 「つきがち」 would imply a habit or frequent negative occurrence of the screen itself, which is
          grammatically awkward for an inanimate object. 「つきやすい」 is better for describing material properties.
    scene: Someone is complaining about their new smartphone.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「つきやすい」 describes an inherent quality of the screen material, that it's susceptible to scratching.
      This is a common and natural use for inanimate objects.

          - 子ども は 風邪 を ひき がち だ。
        english: Children tend to catch colds (emphasizes a frequent negative habit).
        hint: While both are possible, 「ひきやすい」 sounds more like a general truth about children's immune
          systems. 「ひきがち」 could imply they frequently catch colds, perhaps due to carelessness.
    scene: A parent giving advice to another parent.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: This sentence uses 「ひきやすい」 to state a general, natural tendency or vulnerability that children
      have. It's a common observation.

        english: These shoes tend to slip on wet surfaces (implies a repeated, possibly problematic, occurrence).
        hint: 「滑りがち」 would suggest a habit or repeated negative outcome for the shoes. 「滑りやすい」 describes
          an inherent design flaw or material property making them susceptible to slipping.
    scene: A customer is asking a shoe salesperson about the grip of certain shoes.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: The use of 「滑りやすい」 describes an inherent property of the shoes, indicating their susceptibility
      to slipping due to their design or material, rather than a repeated action they 'tend' to do.

    japanese:
      - あの 社員 は ミス を {し やすい}。

      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 社員 は ミス を し がち だ。
        english: That employee tends to make mistakes (implying a frequent, undesirable habit).

      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 社員 は ミス を する きらい が ある。
        english: That employee has a tendency to make mistakes (implying an undesirable habit or fault).

    register: casual
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「しやすい」 describes an inherent characteristic of the employee, their susceptibility to making
      mistakes. While it can imply a negative tendency, it is a broader description than 「しがち」 or 「きらいがある」,
      which more specifically point to undesirable habits or faults.

    japanese:

          - 彼 は 初めて 海外 に 行っ た 時、よく 道 に 迷っ た。
        english: He often got lost when he went abroad for the first time.
        hint: This uses 'often' (よく) with a simple past verb. 「迷いやすかった」 directly describes his inherent
          tendency to get lost in that unfamiliar situation.
    scene: Someone is recounting a friend's travel experience.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female

      his lack of experience or poor sense of direction. It's a past observation of his characteristic.

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 種類 の 植物 は 病気 に なり にくい。
        english: This type of plant is hard to get diseased (i.e., it's resistant).
        hint: 「なりにくい」 means 'hard to become' or 'resistant to becoming'. While semantically similar to
          'not prone to', it uses the antonym 'にくい' rather than the direct negation of 'やすい'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 種類 の 植物 は 病気 に なり にくく ない。
        english: It's not that this type of plant is hard to get diseased (i.e., it is prone to disease).
        hint: This is a double negative ('not not prone to'). It actually means the plant *is* prone to
          disease, which contradicts the English sentence.
    scene: A gardening expert is giving advice.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: The use of 「なりやすくない」 indicates that the plant lacks the tendency to become diseased. It's
      the direct negative form of 「なりやすい」 (prone to becoming). This phrasing confirms it is not susceptible
      to disease.
  - english: I'm the type of person who is prone to worrying.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 心配 {し やすい} タイプ です。
      - 私 は 心配 {し やすい} タイプ な ん です。

    scene: Someone describing their personality to a new friend.

      This is a common way to describe personal characteristics.
  - english: Japanese people are often considered polite and shy, but it's not always easy to characterize

    english_literally: Japanese people, polite and shy, thought, prone to being, but, always so, not limited
      to.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 人 は 丁寧 で 恥ずかし がり 屋 だ と よく 思わ れる が、いつ も そう と は 限ら ない。
        english: Japanese people are often thought to be polite and shy, but that's not always true.
        hint: This uses the passive form with 'often' (よく). 「思われやすい」 implies a natural tendency for people
          to think that way, making it a more inherent observation.
    scene: A speaker is giving a presentation on cultural misconceptions.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: Here, 「思われやすい」 indicates that it is easy or common for people to form the impression that
      Japanese people are polite and shy. It describes a predisposition of perception rather than the
      action itself.
  - english: These older model cars were generally prone to rusting.
    japanese:

      - これ ら の 旧型 車 は 一般 に {錆び やすかっ た} の だ。
    english_literally: These old model cars, generally, was prone to rusting, it is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ ら の 旧型 車 は 一般 に 錆び がち だっ た の です。
        english: These older model cars generally tended to rust (implying a frequent undesirable problem).
        hint: 「錆びがち」 would emphasize a frequent, undesirable occurrence. 「錆びやすかった」 points to an inherent
          material characteristic or design flaw making them susceptible to rust.
    scene: A mechanic is explaining common issues with vintage cars.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    nuance: 「錆びやすかった」 describes an inherent vulnerability of the older car models to rust, indicating
      a material or manufacturing quality that made them susceptible. The use of 「のです」 adds an explanatory
      nuance.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the precise nuance of 「〜やすい」 is crucial. While it can describe the
  ease of an action, its use for "prone to" or "likely to" often highlights an inherent characteristic,
  susceptibility, or tendency. This is particularly evident when describing physical properties of objects
  or inherent traits of people, which may not always carry a negative connotation but imply a natural
  inclination. When considering negative habits or frequent undesirable occurrences, 「がち」 or 「きらいがある」
  might be more appropriate, but 「〜やすい」 provides a broader and often more neutral description of a predisposition.
