    "etymology": "「にかかわらず」 comes from the verb 「係(かか)わる」 (kakawaru), meaning \"to be involved, to concern, to affect\" combined with the negative auxiliary verb 「ず」 (zu). Literally, it means \"without being affected by.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「にかかわらず」 (ni kakawarazu) expresses the meaning of \"regardless of,\" \"whether or not,\" or \"no matter.\" It indicates that a particular condition or factor does not affect the outcome or result. This expression is considered formal and is often used in written language or formal speech, often appearing in official announcements or rules. Its literal meaning is \"without being affected by\" (from the verb 「係わる」 kakawaru, 'to be involved, to affect' and the negative auxiliary 「ず」 zu, 'without').\n\nWhen stating 'regardless of A,' it conveys that A does not influence the situation or outcome. To strengthen the nuance of 'whether A or not A,' or 'irrespective of A,' the same word is frequently repeated in both its positive and negative forms (e.g., 「あるなしにかかわらず」 'regardless of presence or absence') or combined with 「かどうか」 (e.g., 「行くかどうかにかかわらず」 'regardless of whether one goes or not'). This structure emphasizes that the subsequent action or state (B) will occur or exist independently of condition (A). It can also imply that 'any type of (A) will lead to the same (B).'",
