pronunciation:
  katakana: コト ガ アル
  romaji: koto ga aru
formation:
  Verb (た-form) + ことがある: Expresses having the experience of doing something at some point in the past.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  function: Expresses past experience or occurrence.
  nuance: Implies that the action was performed at least once, often contrasted with never having done
    it.
etymology: The phrase combines the past tense of a verb (た) with 「こと」(koto), which nominalizes the preceding
  clause, making it a "thing" or "matter." 「がある」(ga aru) then indicates the existence of this "thing"
  or "matter." So, literally, it means "there is the matter of having done (something)." This construction
  highlights the experience itself as an existing fact, focusing on whether something has happened in
  one's life, rather than when it specifically happened.
writeup: The grammar pattern 「動詞 た形 + ことがある」(doushi ta-kei + koto ga aru) is used to express that one
  has the experience of having performed a certain action at some point in their life. It focuses on the
  existence of the experience, rather than the specific time the action occurred. It is distinct from
  the simple past tense (e.g., 「食べた」 tabeta), which indicates that an action occurred at a specific point
  in the past. While the simple past describes an event, 「たことがある」 describes a state of having experienced
  that event. For example, 「寿司を食べた」 means "I ate sushi (at a specific time)," whereas 「寿司を食べたことがある」 means
  "I have had the experience of eating sushi (at some point in my life)." This pattern is versatile and
  can be used with a wide range of verbs to convey various types of life experiences, from mundane activities
  to significant events.

  - term: たばかり
    meaning: just did
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たばかり」 emphasizes that an action happened very recently, focusing on the recency of the event.
      In contrast, 「たことがある」 emphasizes the existence of the experience at any point in the past.
    grammar_point: たばかり (just did)
  - term: たものだ
    meaning: used to (nostalgic recollection)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たものだ」 is used for nostalgic recollection of past habitual actions or states, implying something
      that occurred repeatedly or was characteristic of a past period. 「たことがある」, however, simply states
      that an action has been experienced at least once, without implying habit or nostalgia.
    grammar_point: たものだ (nostalgic recollection)
  - term: Verb[dictionary-form]ことがある
    meaning: there are times when
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Verb[dictionary-form]ことがある」 indicates that an action or state occurs occasionally or sometimes,
      focusing on a recurring pattern in the present or general truth. This is different from 「たことがある」,
      which confirms a past experience.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[dictionary-form]ことがある (there are times when)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「たことがある」 refers to having a past experience, be careful not to confuse
  it with similar-sounding expressions. 「たばかり」 indicates that an action has just been completed very recently.
  For example, 「食べたばかりだ」 means "I just ate." This is about recency, not the existence of a past experience.
  「たものだ」 is used to describe things that regularly happened in the past, often with a nostalgic feeling,
  like "I used to play there every day." It's about past habits, not a single past experience. 「Verb[dictionary-form]ことがある」
  means "there are times when..." or "sometimes...", indicating occasional occurrences. For example, 「食べることもある」
  means "Sometimes I eat." This talks about a present or general tendency, not a specific past experience.
  Understanding these distinctions is key to using each expression correctly.
