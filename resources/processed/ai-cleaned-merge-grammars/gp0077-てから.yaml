    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てから」 is formed by combining the te-form 「て」 of a verb with the particle 「から」. The 「て」-form indicates a sequence or connection between actions, while 「から」 indicates a starting point or reason. Together, they create a structure that shows that an action or event happens *after* another action has been completed.",
    "writeup": "「てから」 is used to express that something happens after a previous action is completed. It emphasizes the sequence of events, indicating that the second action will not occur until after the first action has finished. It is often translated as \"after doing (A), (B)\" or \"once (A) is done, (B).\" Note that the 「から」 in 「てから」 is different than the 「から」 that means \"because\".",
