        "usage-context": "Used to establish a strict temporal sequence where the second action is contingent on the full completion of the first.",
        "function": "Connects two actions, emphasizing that the first action must be completed before the second can begin.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the first action often enables or prepares for the second action, rather than simply stating a chronological order.",
        "colocation": "Always follows the て-form of a verb.",
        "temporal-flow": "Action A (て-form) finishes completely, then Action B begins.",
        "spatial-flow": "N/A (primarily temporal). While the actions may occur in different spaces, the grammar point itself doesn't inherently describe spatial flow beyond the implication of the actions themselves. For example, leaving a place (`出かける`) before going somewhere else (`行く`). However, the focus is on the temporal sequence, not the spatial transition facilitated by the grammar itself."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てから」 is formed by combining the te-form 「て」 of a verb with the particle 「から」. The 「て」-form indicates a sequence or connection between actions, while 「から」 indicates a starting point or reason. Together, they create a structure that shows that an action or event happens *after* another action has been completed.",
    "writeup": "「てから」 is used to express that something happens **strictly** after a previous action is completed. It emphasizes the sequence of events, indicating that the second action will not occur until after the first action has finished, and often implies that the first action *enables* or *prepares for* the second. It is commonly translated as \"after doing (A), (B)\" or \"once (A) is done, (B).\" It is crucial to distinguish this from the 「から」 that indicates a reason, meaning \"because\" or \"since,\" as their functions are entirely different despite the shared particle.",
