    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てから」 is formed by combining the te-form 「て」 of a verb with the particle 「から」. The 「て」-form indicates a sequence or connection between actions, while 「から」 indicates a starting point or reason. Together, they create a structure that shows that an action or event happens *after* another action has been completed.",
    "writeup": "「てから」 is used to express that something happens **strictly** after a previous action is completed. It emphasizes the sequence of events, indicating that the second action will not occur until after the first action has finished, and often implies that the first action *enables* or *prepares for* the second. It is commonly translated as \"after doing (A), (B)\" or \"once (A) is done, (B).\" It is crucial to distinguish this from the 「から」 that indicates a reason, meaning \"because\" or \"since,\" as their functions are entirely different despite the shared particle.",
