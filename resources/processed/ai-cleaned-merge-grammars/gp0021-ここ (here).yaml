jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: pronoun
  register: casual
  grammatical-role: demonstrative pronoun for place
  spatial-flow: proximity to the speaker
etymology: ここ originates from the demonstrative series ko-so-a-do (こそあど), where ko (こ) indicates proximity
  to the speaker. It is the place-related term corresponding to kore (これ, this). The system evolved from
  earlier forms where the demonstratives referred to specific positions in relation to a central point,
  eventually solidifying into the speaker-centric (ko-), listener-centric (so-), and distal (a-) distinctions.
  Its root in indicating direct proximity to the speaker has remained consistent throughout its development.
writeup: |-
  ここ is one of the fundamental demonstratives in Japanese, belonging to the ko-so-a-do system. Specifically, it refers to a place or location that is "here", meaning near the speaker. In the same way that これ represents 'this (thing)', ここ represents 'this place', or simply 'here'. This distinct focus on physical location differentiates it from other ko-words like これ (this thing) or この (this [noun]).

  The ko-so-a-do system is a crucial aspect of Japanese grammar for demonstrating proximity relative to the speaker and listener:
  *   **Ko- words (こ-):** Refer to things/places near the speaker.
  *   **So- words (そ-):** Refer to things/places near the listener.
  *   **A- words (あ-):** Refer to things/places far from both the speaker and listener.
  *   **Do- words (ど-):** Are interrogatives, asking 'which' thing/place.

  While ここ points to a precise, stationary spot, it is important not to confuse it with こっち, which also translates to 'here' but emphasizes direction or a general area. こっち implies movement towards or refers to a general region, while ここ pinpoints a precise, fixed location. For example, if you are guiding someone, you might say 「こっちへどうぞ」 (Please come this way), but if you are indicating where something should be placed, you would say 「ここに置いてください」 (Please put it here).
false_friends:
  - term: これ
    meaning: This (thing)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: これ refers to a general object, while ここ refers specifically to a place. Both are part of the
      ko- family, indicating proximity to the speaker, but they differ in what they refer to (object vs.
      place).
    grammar_point: これ (this)
  - term: この
    meaning: This (modifies a noun)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: この functions as a determiner, modifying a noun (e.g., この 場所 - 'this place'), whereas ここ stands
      alone as a noun referring to 'this place'. この cannot be used by itself.
    grammar_point: この (this)
  - term: それ
    meaning: That (thing near listener)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: それ refers to an object near the listener, while ここ refers to a place near the speaker. The
      distinction is based on proximity relative to the listener, not the speaker. Both are nouns, but
      differ in the distance they imply from the speaker and listener (so- vs. ko-).
    grammar_point: それ (that・it)
  - term: あれ
    meaning: That (thing far away)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: あれ refers to an object far from both the speaker and listener, while ここ refers to a place
      near the speaker. Pay attention to the relative distance from both parties. Both are nouns, but
      differ in the distance they imply from both parties (a- vs. ko-).
    grammar_point: あれ (that over there)
  - term: あの
    meaning: That (modifies a noun far away)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: あの modifies a noun that is far from both the speaker and listener (e.g., あの 場所 - 'that place
      over there'), while ここ stands alone. Similar to この, あの requires a noun.
    grammar_point: あの (that over there)
  - term: そこ
    meaning: There, That place (near listener)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: そこ refers to a place near the listener, while ここ refers to a place near the speaker. The distinction
      hinges on whose proximity is being referenced. Both are place-nouns, but differ in the distance
      they imply from the speaker (so- vs. ko-).
    grammar_point: そこ (there・that place)
  - term: あそこ
    meaning: Over there (place far away)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: あそこ refers to a place far from both the speaker and listener, while ここ refers to a place near
      the speaker. Remember the three-way distinction of ko-so-a-do. Both are place-nouns, but differ
      in the distance they imply from both parties (a- vs. ko-).
    grammar_point: あそこ (over there)
  - term: その
    meaning: That (modifies a noun near listener)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: その modifies a noun that is near the listener (e.g., その 場所 - 'that place'), while ここ stands
      alone. Like この and あの, その must be followed by a noun.
    grammar_point: その (that・near listener)
  - term: どこ
    meaning: Where
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: どこ is an interrogative, asking 'where,' while ここ is a statement of location, 'here.' One asks
      a question, the other provides an answer. Both refer to places, but differ in their assertive vs.
      interrogative function (do- vs. ko-).
    grammar_point: どこ (where)
  - term: こっち
    meaning: This way, here (directional)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: こっち emphasizes direction or a general area, whereas ここ specifically refers to a fixed, stationary
      place. While both can be translated as 'here,' こっち implies movement towards or refers to a general
      region, while ここ pinpoints a precise, fixed location.
    grammar_point: こっち (this way)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To avoid confusion with these similar expressions, remember the core principle
  of the ko-so-a-do system: ko- words (like ここ) refer to something near the speaker, so- words (like そこ)
  refer to something near the listener, and a- words (like あそこ) refer to something far from both. Also,
  distinguish between words that stand alone as nouns (ここ, そこ, あそこ) and those that modify other nouns
  (この, その, あの). Finally, remember that こっち emphasizes a general direction or area, while ここ specifies
  a precise, fixed location.'

    setting: interrogative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「すみません」 is a polite way to start a question, commonly used by both genders. 「ここ」 points directly
      to the immediate vicinity, suitable for asking about a specific establishment's location to a passerby
      you don't know, hence the formal register. There is no specific Japanese that would indicate 'male'
      or 'female' in this example, but it's a common phrase for a male tourist to use when seeking directions
      politely.

      designated area by the entrance.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「～てください」 is a standard polite command, common in service industries. 「ここ」 precisely

      「わ」, which is strongly associated with female speech to express emphasis or a softened assertion.

          a specific spot or property.
    scene: A man on a house tour, standing in a specific room, expressing his strong desire to live in
      that particular house/location.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「私が住みたいのはここです」 uses a focusing particle 「は」 to emphasize 「ここ」 as the desired location, making
      the statement very direct. The phrase 「～たいです」 expresses desire politely. This expresses a strong
      personal sentiment, common for either gender.
  - english: Is this your first time here?
    japanese:
      - '{ここ} は 初めて です か。'
      - '{ここ} は 初めて で いらっしゃい ます か。'
    english_literally: Here, first time, is it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{この} 場所 は 初めて です か。'
        english: Is this place your first time?
        hint: 「この場所」 is technically correct but less natural and common than simply using 「ここ」 when inquiring
          about someone's first visit to an immediate location.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{ここ} に 来る の は 初めて です か。'
        english: While grammatically sound, this is a more verbose way of asking the same question. 「ここ
          は 初めて です か」 is concise and natural.
        hint: While grammatically sound, this is a more verbose way of asking the same question. 「ここ は
          初めて です か」 is concise and natural.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{そこ} は 初めて です か。'
        english: Is there (near you) your first time?
        hint: 「そこ」 refers to a place near the listener, whereas the speaker is asking about the place
          *they are currently in* or *at* with 「ここ」.
    scene: An older woman, hosting a tea ceremony, politely asking a younger guest if it's their first
      time attending.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This is a very common and polite phrase used to welcome guests and initiate conversation.
      The simple 「ここ は 初めて です か」 is natural and friendly. An older female host might use this soft, welcoming
      tone. The more formal 「いらっしゃいますか」 is respectful language (sonkeigo).
  - english: This is the safest place.
    japanese:
      - '{ここ} が 一番 安全 な 場所 です。'
      - '{ここ} が 最も 安全 です。'
    english_literally: Here, most safe place is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{この} 場所 が 一番 安全 です。'
        english: This place is the safest.
        hint: While 「この場所」 is grammatically correct, 「ここ」 is more direct and immediate when pointing out
          the current spot as the safest.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{この} 辺り が 一番 安全 です。'
        english: This area is the safest.
        hint: 「この辺り」 refers to a broader vicinity, not the precise, immediate spot indicated as the safest
          by 「ここ」.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{そこ} が 一番 安全 です。'
        english: There (near you) is the safest place.
        hint: 「そこ」 indicates a place near the listener, but the speaker is identifying *their own current
          location* as the safest.
    scene: During an emergency, a man calmly tells a woman that the spot they are standing in offers the
      most protection.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「ここ が 一番 安全 です」 or 「ここ が 最も 安全 です」 (most safe) directly asserts the current location's superiority
      in terms of safety. The use of 「です」 keeps the tone factual and reassuring during a serious situation.
      This phrasing is direct and authoritative, suitable for a male speaker providing calm instruction
      in an emergency.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, ここ is versatile and essential for indicating immediate,
  specific locations. It often carries a sense of directness and personal connection to the spot. Its
  usage spans polite requests, direct instructions, and expressions of personal sentiment, always maintaining
  its core meaning of 'this place' or 'here,' near the speaker. Pay close attention to the context and
  other particles like 「に」, 「で」, and 「から」 to fully grasp its function within a sentence.
